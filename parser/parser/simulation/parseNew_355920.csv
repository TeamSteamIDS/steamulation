												I'm actually writing this review because I am thoroughly impressed with the developers. They had done many bug fixing patches but I encountered one they missed. I asked them to please look into it and see if another patch was needed. That very same day, they released another patch just to fix the issue I had found. So they not only keep track of the discussion board on a regular basis, but they also listen to us and fix things promptly.I've always enjoyed their jigsaw puzzle games and Space is just as fun as the rest. While you're playing, there are little mechanical cylinders floating all around (in the same floaty space as your puzzle pieces). There are 3 little spacecrafts at the bottom of the screen and you can place a cylinder in one of them to get a hint. Since there are so many cylinders, you can use many hints, if need be. The first little rocket will show you the picture again for a few seconds so you can make a game plan. (hit the letter G to launch it). The second little rocket will show you where in the puzzle the piece you're holding goes - so pick up a piece and hit the space bar. The last little rocket rotates your puzzle piece to the correct angle. So pick up a piece and hit ctrl. (I think I got that right). Also, I believe there is an option to set all the pieces to the correct angle to begin with if you dislike rotating them. So... after you put a cylinder into a little rocket and hit the correct key to gain that hint, the rocket will blast up and off your screen - but will reappear again right away so you can use that hint again.Now for the fun part. If you don't use a single cylinder for any hints, you can build the BIG rocket, all the way to the left of the screen. It requires every single cylinder to complete - thus why you can't use hints. If you're not planning on using any hints or you find you're almost done with the puzzle and haven't used any cylinders, then build that huge rocket (with each cylinder added, you can see it take shape) and it will blast off when completed. Okay, it's very cool looking but why are we doing this exactly? Because when you finish your puzzle, a shuttle will come down and land perfectly straight - which gives you a ""launch puzzle"" achievement along with the ""complete puzzle"" achievement. Two achievements for the price of one. As long as you don't use any hints.Lastly, if you're feeling morbid and twisted, you can grab onto the spaceman jumping around, drag him all the way to the top of the screen, and drop him. He will splat and you'll have a nice little bloody mess to stare at while you're working away on your puzzle. I did it once to see what it was like but it was just a little too ooky for me. I mean, I was trying to relax with a cool puzzle and nifty space music - so killing the poor spaceman and then getting to stare at my handywork kinda broke the mood I was going for. :pIn closing: This is a very enjoyable jigsaw puzzle game made by developers who care and listen to us. I recommend this game wholeheartedly.			"

""NASA - Space Shuttle - Moon""PixelPuzzles2: Space is another game from the PixelPuzzles series. It's still a nice and entertaining jigsaw puzzle game but somehow it gets pretty laggy on a high amount of puzzle pieces floating around the board or caused by the dynamical generated rocket fog. Thankfully there's a built-in help function. Collect rocket pieces to the satellite launchers. Unfortunately the number of helps is limited and you'll also need the rocket pieces to buildup a full rocket for launch (another achievement each puzzle). The 26 pictures are pretty much one sided or the same scene just zoomedout like Astronauts in Space, on the moon or Spaceshuttle launches.			"

												There are a couple of variations compared to how I lay classical puzzles that it kills the whole idea for me- No fusing segments together, so you can't make the big things off the board and drag it as a whole to where it should roughly fit.- Auto-fitting and not being able to pick the pieces up anymore if they're in the correct spot. Auto-fit on everything even if it's not correct and allowing you to pick them up again would be much nicer, or just make it tighter so it doesn't autofit nearly as fast.Note that this is also prone to going trial-and-error through the puzzle. I'd really like to be able to disable that so that I don't accidentally complete pieces I didn't intend to or had settled on yet			"

												After visiting Japan, fighting undeads, observing birds and watching anime, you're going to space! Pixel Puzzles: Space is a jigsaw game, based on the universe, planets, astronauts and everything that can go to space.You have to build pictures by assembling pieces that are floating in space, which is the core of the game. However, now, you can choose any puzzle instead of waiting to unlock them: meaning that you can begin by the 350 pieces one and finish by the easier ones of 60 pieces.To make your job a little easier, you can use bonus: see the whole picture for a few minutes, rotate the piece or show the right place. But how to unlock them? Floating with the pieces, you'll find parts of a rocket. Put one of them on the bonus you want to use and launch it. However, using the bonus will prevent you to launch a bigger rocket and to unlock the puzzle launch achievement. In other words, if you're an achievement hunter and using bonus in every puzzle, you'll have to do them twice. At least one of them will have to be done that way as achievements for launching the bonus are also included.While the feature above is the main novelty of the game, with the freedom of choosing any puzzle, I have to speak about the little astronaut bouncing around. He's not annoying (he doesn't speak) but some people are bored to see him - contrary to me that managed to forget him at each puzzle. You can take him and make him bounce from an higher height, until you hear him scream and crash on the ground, dead.My only little problem is that while trying to place a piece and rotating it too quickly is sending it back to the floating sky. Besides, for the pieces that are doing the outline, they're also often send back to it. While they're placed correctly, you can see them move a little during the process. If you try to place them at that exact place, it's like the game is considering that place as the floating sky. It's annoying after a while as the best way to begin the puzzle is to find a maximum of the outline pieces.I loved the pictures in it: they're really varied - planets (Earth or not), deep space, astronauts, shuttles launching, satellites, anything that is related to space and that can make a beautiful view. The soundtrack itself is very faithful to the theme.However, I noticed that on my laptop, the game was lagging a lot while on my desktop, it worked perfectly fine. I don't know why however and I will not try to find the answer as I finished the game on the desktop.Pixel Puzzles: Space had an hard launch because of the bugs tied to the launch achievements and to puzzles not resetting. However, these are fixed. I waited for that to make a review (and to finish the game). Else I was ready to post a positive review about it.Pixel Puzzles: Space is easily one of my favorites in the series, with Japan. Developers did a nice job. If you have any patience and loves jigsaw games, you can buy this one without problems. You have 25 nice pictures with the ultimate challenge of not using any bonus (that's the first game where I didn't rely on the bonus, apart for the achievements related to them).			"

												Pixel Puzzle franchise. Recommended for those who literally like to put puzzles together, and I do mean piece by piece. Pixel Puzzles 2: SpaceFeatures space and all things related: planets, nebulae, astronaunts, satellites, space craft. There is even an introductary puzzle of the space shuttle found on the main screen. 24 puzzles in all ranging from 60 pieces to 350 pieces, with some odd shaped and space themed puzzle pieces (arrows, stars, rockets). All the puzzles can be seen in the picture gallery once the puzzle is solved. The game grid is floating spheres so the player can choose any puzzle they want without constraint.Puzzles: 60 piece - 5, 112 piece - 6, 153 piece- 6, 220 piece - 6, and 350 piece - 1.The game board is surrounded by space where the puzzle pieces float and MOVE. The pieces also must be rotated to gain the correct orientation (like in a physical puzzle.) Fortunately there is an option for the player to choose the correct orientation permenantly (or until such time as the player chooses to turn it off). I recommend having this feature on for the 220 piece and 350 piece puzzles due to the size of the pieces.Best feature of this game: The Launch. In this game a spaceman bounces about trying to flag down a space craft.  During the puzzle phase if the player uses no hints and builds the rocket from the floating capsules among the puzzle pieces the rocket will launch.  If the rockets launches, at the end of the puzzle the rocket will return to pick up the bouncing astronaut.NOTE: There is a launch achievement attached to ever puzzle, making every puzzle solved actually worth 2 achievements: one to solve and one to pick up the astronaut.However, if the player choses, the floating capsules can be used as hints. Simply put a capsule in one of the three tiny landers to launch them for the hint.  The first lander (left to right) is ""ghost"". This power-up shows the puzzle picture for approximately 10 seconds. The second lander (L to R) will cause the selected puzzle to gain the correct orientation (unless the player rotates the piece). The third lander (L to R) shows exactly where that piece belongs in the puzzle, edge or middle.Other functions can be found in a side vertical menu including: a tray to hold the pieces, shuffle the pieces, zoom in on the puzzle board, and changing the puzzle board's background color. There 55 achievements and trading cards available.			"

												And another game played from the Pixel Puzzles Franchise.Not much different from Pixel Puzzles 2: Anime except the pictures.A little difference comes in place when you want to get some help solving the puzzles. There are rocket parts floating around. You decide to put them together to build a rocket, or use them to get hints about orientation or position of a puzzle piece.I really like, that it had achievements for solving every puzzle without using the rocket pieces to get hints. They were not too hard to solve, the biggest with 350 pieces took me around 3 hours. The smaller one with 60 pieces only 10-15 minutes.I didn't like a bug at puzzles with 220+ pieces, where pieces at the edge of the puzzle board dropped below the board, if they were not in the correct spot. Often you either had to pick them up instantly, or you have to shuffle the floating pieces by pressing the 'S'-key, because they were stuck under the board.I was glad to not have a similar minigame as we had it with the Undead-Puzzle.8/10, recommended for every jigsaw fan			"

												I own all the Pixel Puzzles games, and am a devoted fan, and this release I'd rate average compertively to the rest. It has a similar amount of content to Birds and Undeadz, and shares the rotation mechanic, which is great. There is a sorting tray and there are no items intefering with your puzzle board (unlike Birds), which is a plus. The art, in my personal opinion, is very repetitive and lacking imagination - I wish there were more planets such as Mars and for instance a puzzle portraying the insides of a spaceship. The steam achievements are significantly more grindy - as to complete all you cannot use any hints. Furthermore some of the tiles have very difficult boarders (dozens of spikes) which basically forces you to click all over and hope for the best, rather than giving you a chance to use your spotting skills to combine edges. I highly recommend grabbing Undeadz, Anime and Birds over this one if you are considering them. All in all, I do recommend this game and am waiting for a new release.			"

TL;DReview: Definitely the bad apple in the Pixel Puzzle bunch.Bugs: Crashes on exit; No save date lost. Puzzle alignment is off.Achievements: 100% completion possible by solving all puzzles without using any power-ups (and using them to launch the rockets instead).Final Verdict: 3/10The designs are a bit uninspired, the NASA logos are blurred out, and the jigsaw alignment is slightly off to the topright which can cause some annoyances when trying to place side and corner pieces. The difficulty is easy for all puzzles but takes a steep jump up at the final puzzle. "

A Jigsaw Puzzle Simulator

+ Nice looking image to re-create+ Great User Interface that makes moving and places peices very easy+ Interesting Hint / Help system that helps you if you get stuck+ Different sized puzzles for those looking for a greater challenge.~ Unique cutout shapes for the puzzle pieces, personally I wished they could have included normal generic style puzzle pieces as some of the shapes are extremely strange on some stages, but at the same time I thought it was pretty interesting.- Pieces auto-snap into place if it's in the correct position even if it's not touching other pieces. This makes the game a bit too easy as you can just rotate pieces until they fit without actually taking the time to see if it matches up. Sometimes I'd just get lucky and randomly find spots for pieces just because it auto-snaped into place.-  It was hard to tell what the power-up / hints actually did or how to activate them. I only figured out how to do one.Overall it's a great Jigsaw Puzzle Simulator and is a nice relaxing game that anyone can play.			"

												Another puzzle game from Decaying Logic this time in space. Puzzle sizes range from 60 to 350. Beautiful images from space including nebulas, space walks, planets and more. Instead of just doing puzzles, you can also build rockets that when completed will launch into space. In order to put the puzzle pieces in their right place you must rotate them.  The music fits the whole space theme of the game. A great way to relax and enjoy a casual game. 10/10.			"

												I received this game for free from Cubic Bundle for being a top donator as part of a bundle pack they sent me that also inlcuded PP2: Birds. I have to say I'm throughly impressed at the game its very relaxing the background music isn't invasive and repetitive like some games you can vary the difficulty by allowing the pieces to rotate or be set in the position they are in the picture. I like the mini puzzles building the rockets. I will definitely be buying all the other games I've already bought PP: Ultimate and all the DLC for it. If you after a relaxing game this it a good choice.			"

												Simple puzzle game. My first desire was to go to windowed mode, but there didn't seem to be a way to change the resolution or play in a small windowed mode. Or reduce the impact the game has on my machine.There's nothing really unique, propriety, or special about the images. They seemed ""stock"" to me. Obviously they're all themed to the name. There is a set number of puzzles of set piece count. The game is generous for piece placement, but you won't be able to connect up pieces outside of the board. And pieces dropped on the edges of the board will go behind. You'll notice that the edges of the pieces are weird shapes, so it's a little more awkward to play by shape matching. The pieces move around in the background. You can make them stationary by moving them to the ""tray"" at the bottom of the screen. There is an astronaut jumping around back there as well. Also floating around are rocket parts that you can ""launch"" if you assemble them all. Alternatively, the the same rocket piece can be launched to be utilised as a hint. It's a neat add-on, and with achievements for launching each puzzle, it's meant to reward the ""no-hint"" players.While the game is mostly satisfactory, it doesn't go beyond. And for that reason, I recommend spending your time on better puzzle games.			"

												I'm always very partial to these puzzle games because they bring back fond memories of doing jigsaw puzzles at the dining room table with my uncle. Having said that, I do have one minor complaint about this Pixel Puzzles game; There aren't that many puzzles involving planets. While I don't mind putting together the random astronaut or spaceship every once in a while, it seemed to me, that while playing, most of the puzzles were astronauts or space stations. I would've liked to have had more planets or galaxies to put together. They probably would've been more challenging, and they definitely would've been more pretty. Even though the puzzle selection was kind of disappointing, the game itself was enjoyable, and definitely worth the investment. Not to mention, these games are usually an easy 100%, if that's something you're interested in.			"

												First things first tl;dr; - don't buy this game just for Steam Trading Cards, because it does not work and the Store is wrong. That's developers fault and actually made me dislike this game.So pros:It's puzzle game and a time waster, so puzzle lovers can get their kicks out of it.BMG is cool, it's good background and fits to every puzzle.Cons:*Pointless addons (flying astronaut [you can kill him for no purpose whatsoever], randomly flying around rockets to build a spaceship {pointless} or give you hints for the puzzle - like anyone needed that)*puzzle pieces auto-snap to their places if close enough and stay in place (this is a puzzle game dev, we don't need this clickfest)*the game lies about Steam Trading Cards and that shows a recless developerSo for a timewaster it's good enough, but still I don't recommend it.

												After I got Pixel Puzzles: UneadZ for free I decided to buy the other games. So I got Pixel Puzzles 2: Space in a bundle and I paid around 50 cents for it. For that price it's worth every cent. It has plenty of puzzles and achievements. If you quit in the middle of a game it saves. Takes some time but can be 100%-ed. Almost forgot, in Pixel Puzzles 2: Space you have to rotate puzzle pieces in order to complete a puzzle. I assume other Pixel Puzzles 2 have the same feature. There's a glitch when some pieces are missing but if you go back and return to the level they will appear again. I'd say wait for a sale and grab it if you're into this kind of games.			"

												Yet another puzzle game in the series. Most of mechanics i already covered in reviews for the 1st game and for the second series. All pictures are ok, i wouldn't call any one of them an incomprehensible repetative mess *cough, pinguins, cough*.So, new mechanics of trading hints for achievements is kinda cool and encourages clean completion, and assembling the rocket itself is fun at the beginning, but near the end it becomes a tedium.Works fine in UHD UWS, with pillarboxing, and fine in windowed mode.As always, if you want one — it is one.
