												StoryThe story is almost nonexistent so I made one to role play as my own. I took the role of a kid with a large supply of LSD going on a permanent trip and raising a dog at the same time. This seemed to fit in well with the rest of the game and the comic sans like text.GameplayI was extremely disappointed in the gameplay. All that you do is move your mouse around and left click. I see what they were shooting for but they seriously need to add more gameplay elements to squeeze out more game time.The feeding feature in the game is the most important element. If you feed your pet too much basic food their stomach will get ♥♥♥♥ed and they will become sick and you will have to blow all of your ♥♥♥♥ing cash on the little ♥♥♥♥♥. In real life I had to put my dog down when she became sick and the lack of realism really ripped me out of the game. You should be given the option to be able to pay the medical bills or put the dog down. Another thing you can do with your doggo is make it do tricks. This piece of the game was also a letdown for me. When the game's text notified me I had unlocked the roll over trick, I attempted to roll over but it then said I hadn't unlocked the ability. This mildly upset me until I grinded to unlock the roll over ability all over again. The ability you would be able to unlock after rolling over is glitched and you cannot unlock it. We may never know what that trick was without a trip into the game's .ini files.Graphics/PerformanceThe graphics in this game were extremely underwhelming for the most part but the models created for the dogs were honestly on point. You are given a decent selection of puppers and an unlockable doggo labeled ""special."" I have not yet unlocked the special dog and will update my review if that happens.The game is stuck, much like Conan the mighty pig and Dark Souls, at 30 frames per second. This demolishes any hopes of you going competitive in this game and you should look to higher tier titles like Golf With Your Friends for any such action.MusicI usually give positive praise towards games for their nice soundtracks but this game's soundtrack in particular made me want to hang myself by the cord of my mouse. It does not fit in well with the gameplay on screen and actually gave me a headache, forcing me to stop for my own well-being. OverallPro(s):•	Decent looking puppersCon(s):•	Ear bleeding music•	Boring gameplay•	Story takes a lot of imagination from a role player’s perspective •	30 FPS•	Comic sans like text•	Illusion of choice (Pay medical bills/ kill dog)•	Glitched parts of the game that are unreachable•	Boring gameplayIn my greatest attempt to be nice, only buy this game if you are either A) Brain dead or B) Emotionally detached from reality and need to escape to a virtual dog with minimal feedback and few negative responses to give yourself a much needed ego boost after getting your ♥♥♥ whipped by an alcoholic father.Or if you want to get from 49 games on Steam to 50. Even then only buy it on sale. "
