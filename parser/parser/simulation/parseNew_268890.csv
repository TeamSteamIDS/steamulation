												There's a double DRM, that limit your activation to only two graphic card, CPU, HDD, SSD, Windows change...So basicly, you change a part or start the game with an HDD not connected but it was before, you lose an activation.Say goodbye to your game if the company go bankrupt.Double DRM on Steam help no way the devs other than killing the sale.Avoid the game, say NO to double DRMs.			"

												Considering this game was released March 2013 I dont see how they can justify the price of Â£39.99, despite the updates this game has recived (even though they were quite spaced out), there are still many flaws and odd bugs that will crop up during gameplay. If your into political / management games then its quite fun but dont even think about attacking anyone as your country will automatically hate you and you will lose the game.The game still feels unpolished and slow especially when having played a country for 3+ years and as I said odd bugs will creep up like France having 99% of the worlds GDP?This game does have it charms, I like playing as Equatorial New Guinea and trying to claim Africa but the games forces me to stop and start from scratch, It is fun when its working properly but those moments come rarely.Wait for this to come cheaper, 75% off before you buy then try it. Otherwise just give it a miss, which is a real shame as I love these kinds of games. I got my fingers crossed for Supreme Ruler 1936 to be nice and polished for release this spring.			"

												Game concept is great. Game execution not great. Anything more than $5-10 Game price: Not worth it. Now that I won it, I'll keep playing it, but it is really not as polished as it should be. I bought the add-ons. Examples: South Korea has a Vietnamese city called Saigon. US outstanding Debt is about half that of Germany. In reality US is about 17 trillion to Germany's 5-600 billion. The AI for war/conflicts is horrendously bad. Never leave the direction fo your troops to your general. Even when a country no longer exists your AI thinks the conflict is continuing. If a NATO member is attacked (i.e. Russian invasion of Poland), NATO doesn't mobilize. The number of interactions capable with leaders/advisors is extremely limited. Again, this is a great concept for a game. If it was polished and had more features I would rate it 4.5 out of 5 or higher. As it is right now it is like a 1.5 out of 5. The concept keeps you engaged, the gameplay doesn't. STRONGLY suggest you don't buy.			"

												This game has several game breaking bugs that can just stop you from playing a game, forcing you to start again. For example I was kicked out of my country for having a defecit, when i was still shown as having surplus, my income was more than my expense, yet I was kicked out. Several other people have similar problems. The devs seem not to care about their fanbase at all.Price is too high for the quality of the game, and the price was not dropped in time like most other games.If you have 50 dollars to throw around, I would buy this game, as it is still the best domestic and internatiol political simulator out there, but dont expect to get too much out of it.

												The game is awesome, probably the best strategy game i've ever played.One of the probles on the game are the bugs, for exemple: When the high speed train arrives in 46,000 km, when i'm going to cunstruct more, the game crashes, or when the game arrives in 23:00 p.m the game crashes too.I lost 2 in 2023 and 2025.Another problem is the lack of updates, we are already in June and there isn't any update, to fix any bug that is since 2013.I woud recommend the game to my friends if doesn't had so many bugs that spoils the game.

Posted: April 3, 2014
												This is my review of the game after being first scared off and close to not trying it. I enjoy it alot.This is a Marvellous game for those people who are interested in Geopolitics, aren't looking for a quick Command and Conquer-styled game and enjoy running a simulated nation from top-down. It is important to emphasise that this is more of a simulator than a game. People who enjoyed Superpower 2 or are interested in a geo-political simulator will enjoy this game, but the game has a steep learning curve, and having an education helps.OverviewMasters of the World - Geopolitical Simulator 3 is a simulator first and foremost. Whilst the simulator can be a game of tactics, it is much more than that. In this game, knowledge of the world and how government's run will help you understand how this simulator works. In the simulator you can play as any country in the world and run its affairs. The game has the nations as of 2013 and 2014, and the governments that run them with comical mimicks of the real-life leaders. Once you enter the simulator, you will have to face that country's problems head-on. The game has 5 major areas: Politics, Economy, Military, Diplomacy and Trade. Each part is interesting and has different challenges and positives. You really need to balance each of them as each strain is interlinked with the other.PositivesThere are heaps of positives in this game that make me enjoy it, but here are my favourite 3:- Depth of the simulator. The developers really made this so you have to think about the simular from an educated perspective. The simulator has 5 major areas has alot of you to go through, lots of details and statistics. For example, in the Economy you have to manage taxation, debts, budgets, and trade in order to make a better economy. Each of these are in even more depth, from tax on alcohol to organising trade contracts with different countries for profit, and to the economy split into Industry, Services, Agriculture, etc so as to represent your country's production. This is replicated in the areas of Politics, Military and Trade, but not really in the diplomacy field. You change these statisics by the actions you take.- Simulated world events. The news really gives you an overview of what is happening in the world. The simulator simulates the status of the world's economy, politics and wars and this is always interesting in my opinion. I find even protests within country's I control represent to me issues that the nation faces (welfare dependency, police numbers, etc). This is a very interesting dynamic to the game.- Cause and effect. Everything has cause and effect. For example, raising taxes makes more money but affects your popularity, the purchase power of your people, unemployment and other factors. Going to war can allow you to colonise, annex or integrate a country, but costs heaps of money (transporting soldiers, or sailing navies in reality isn't cheap!) and relies on positive public opinion.There is much more, but those are my favourite three.NegativesThere is quite a few downsides to the game that need improvement. There has been alot of criticism for Double DRM in this game, but I never had any problems with it (as I can play it offline and no issues c/f Ubisoft games). Double DRM exists in heaps of games, where Steam protects the game from copying but the game producers also try to have it. This issue is a wide-ranging issue but I haven't had any issues with it. The other widely-criticised issue is only being allowed to install the game so many times. This isn't too much of an issue if you don't delete your games, and has been around for ages. If you have any problems, its been said that you just have to contact the company for remedy.To be honest, much of the criticism of the game Re DRM and other hasn't been an issue at all for me. In terms of gameplay, here are the worst bits:- Learning Curve.One of the hardest things for people in this game is the learning curve. My first 7 games were tragedies, I was either assassinated, kicked out of government or fled overseas because my people hated me. This, if you read the other reviews, is why others have then rated this game badly. Just because you might play a few games and fail doesn't mean its unplayable, it means you need to understand things better.But this difficulty, while a reflection of the reality of making difficult policy decisions, is also something that may scare some people off who just want a quick game.- Conflicts. Unlike other games, there are conflicts that erupt all the time across the globe. 90% of these conflicts are just skirmishes (North Korea bombing a South Korean island, city, etc) that doesn't erupt into a bigger war and stops at the skirmish. The other 10% is a major war, which results in either the colonisation/annexation/integration of another region, or a ceasefire. For example: I was in a big war besides USA, France, Mexico and Brazil v Venezuela. Venezuela blew up a US Nuclear Reactor on US islands in the Mediterranean. After much military manouvering and many failed US landings, 5 months later a ceasefire was signed. This part of the game is 50/50. While it produces alot of fun to watch/be part of a war and brings a combat dynamic into the game most of the time, it can be quite tricky and doesn't really correctly simulate how often conflicts erupt.- Broadcasts. The game could do without it, but it adds a comical feature to the game. Events allow your leader or others to give you briefings, tell you about events, United Nations speeches, etc. This is fun to listen to your advisors/other world leaders, but can be a bit repetative. You can turn this off though.- UI. The Game's UI isn't very good. It is manageable, but because the game has alot of depth it can be difficult to easily switch from normal view to military view, to zoom in and to get the information you want on your screen quickly. It just takes a little more time and hence patience in my experience.ConclusionFor a game made by indie developers, this is a great game. It is not made by a major developer, these guys have a small team but bring quite a big simulator that is overall enjoyable. Sure it isn't Europa Universalis 4, but it is a geo-politica simulator that does what in my opinion, is a good simulation. The geo-political simulator that is alot of fun,and very interesting It is especially enjoyable if you know your stuff (such as the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008, what made the Global Financial Crisis happen, what a tax actually is, etc etc). Definitely, coming from a university background, this game makes alot of sense and allows me to enjoy a global simulation where I can be any country. This game is more for the grand strategy gamer with some intellect, rather than the ""where is my artillery and explosion"" gamer.I came to this game very skeptical, and was close not to buying it. I read the negative Steam reviews and thought, well, why should I try it if its -so- bad? I contacted the developers and told them that I'm uncertain about the game. I decided to buy it and haven't regretted it as someone who is interested in geo-political issues and likes grand strategy games. As one of the original purchasers of Superpower 2, this game reflects the fun I had in that game.Furthermore, success in this game is in the eye of the beholder. One of my most successful games was playing as Australia, where I was able to make a budget surplus, and start to pay off my debt. With surplus I built stadiums, theatres, airports, and a larger army that I used to take over different Pacific islands and colonise them. Overall, I would give this game 8/10. Contact me if you have any questions :)It isn't the best game out there, but in a limited market for these types of games its good.			"

												The concept is good. The gameplay can be enjoyable and interesting, and sometimes hilarious. However the reason I cannot recommend this game is simply because it is flooded with bugs and ambiguity. ""Everyone is protesting your lax policy"" - thats nice and all but wtf is a lax policy?""-1% popularity: Scientific Discovery"" - why am I losing popularity for discoverying something and publishing it after it made everyone happy? And why is it happening repeatedly for 1 week?""Â£25Bn on Foreign Policy"" - thats nice...how do I cut it? Where do I cut it? Can I even adjust it? The Foreign aid I give comes no where close so where is the rest cuz its going over budget by more than 15% As for bugs, the game is riddled with them. Always has been. For instance, my AI general sends a tank to take a city, but my ally takes the city first. But my general REALLY wants that city so continues the attack. Boom. Instant war with my ally. UN hates me. EU hates me. My people hate me. I get diposed and start WW3. Thats just one really annoying bug which I have to reload to fix. If Eversim had continued working on GPS3 and fixed bugs and actually responded to feedback, hell if there was a SINGLE update, I'd be able to recommend this game. But I don't recall any updates/bug fixes. Instead they released an ""add-on"" which allows you to mod the game. And an expansion which allows you to start in 2014. Then moved onto their next game, ignoring the player's woes, bugs and issues. If you can accept the bugs, and get used to the ambiguity in the game, then I'd recommend it for aspiring politicians or people who just like to start world wars, or like long-lasting, complex micro-managing games (like me). Otherwise I cannot.			"

												Ok, first things first, this game is fun. Since political simulation games are a rare species, and this is one of the few of them, I normaly would recommend it to everyone who likes this type of games. You really have to work to have your plans work out, no matter if it's economic grow, demographics or military expansion. Especially the latter is hard to achieve, since you have to fight bad publicity both internationaly and intern. The gameplay is very deep and it's very challenging to achieve your goals.The graphics are decent. Not good, not bad, but still enough for this type of game. As for sound, that's ok too. I dunno if it's a bug, but I hear the music of other games while playing this one (Distant Worlds).The only reason why I don't recommend it is the simple fact that it has DRM. So you're not only limited to buy it on Steam here, but also have limited activations and... hell, I just hate DRM. Way to go, thank you Eversim. Unfortunatly I haven't read it, else I wouldn't have thought about buying it.So, summerized:Decent Game, a little buggy, but fun. I'll give it a 7/10, because I like the genre and since this game is a rare specimen... and subtract 7 points for the DRM. That's 0/10 for you, until the DRM is patched out. As soon as that is done, I'll make a recommention.			"

												having played the previous buggy version on rise of nations I thought I might as well spend some more money and buy this game. As soon as I loaded up the game I realised its just the same as rise of nations but with the bugs sorted out.But no, this game has got bugs as well.To the developers: Try fixing your games before pretending to release another one ( thats the same ) just to take thousands of $$$$$$ away from people. No workshop becuase you can charge more money for mod support. To anyone interested in this game, please dont do it. it looks slick but way too many bugs to enjoy it. STAY AWAY!!!			"

												Pretty terrible. Besides basic graphical elements missing like mouse scrolling of the map, the economic modeling/decision making is aweful. Interest rates and trade contracts? Really? That's essentially it? Sure it's fun to buy essetentially useless tanks and power plants for a decade while you watch your economy/budget freefall every time. Even the IMF is unrealistic--as Turkey they forgave me 300m in debt just because I was running a budget surplus. Their message was basically here's your reward for balancing your budget...what? The IMF in reality will only forgive debt they know they're never get back anyway. If you can pay, they'll take every bit they can get.    Lastly, political instability is a joke. Playing as several African nations in sequence,  I was overthrown by the healthcare syndicate (WTF?!?,) forced out of office while I had 100% popularity, had two military coups, and was conquered by Ethliopia (granted playing a Somolia) ALL WITHIN THE FOR 30 DAYS OF GAMEPLAY!!!   Well, wasted $50 here writing this only so others can avoid the same thing. Go buy a Paradox Interactive game for a lower price and get a polished, fun game...and not have a bunch of doctors run you out of office when you have all the guns...			"

												*Even at the updated price this game is still not worth it* July 24. I really enjoy this game, don't get me wrong. And i've put a lot of hours into it, because the concept of the game is absolutely amazing. However I cannot give this a positive rating at this time. The game is riddled with bugs, sometimes game breaking. It could be a bug causing your country to go bankrupt, or maybe it'll cause you to have excessive inflation, or causes a breakdown in the correlation between the decisions you make and the ingame economics. Instead of fixing the game crippling bugs, the developers ignore all the issues and have created Geopolitical Simulator 4. Because they've done this instead of fixing their game (which should really be in beta release, not published as a completed game), It has caused this 'game' to not feel like a game. Instead it feels like I have been robbed of my money.  I feel like I gave this game a fighting chance by paying full price, hoping that by supporting the developers it might encourage them to fix the bugs. I was wrong. Save yourself the money and don't buy this broken game.I'll change my review if the developers ever release a patch that fixes even half the issues of the game.			"

												I highly recommend this game for anyone who is a political geek. The game is extremely in-depth. It goes from well-known laws like freedom of speech/demonstration/religion to tiny aspects you'd never see in a geopolitical simulator; blood toxicity level, driving age, maximum age for school, and speed limits on trunk roads, city roads, and highways. It also has a very realistic atmosphere to it. Setting aside the fact the map and characters look like 90s era games, it gives the game a feel no other geopolitical simulator has given me; realism. It goes from setting meetings with political figures and world leaders, to having small talk and influencing well-known figures in your country to vote for you or support your bill publicly. When a law doesn't pass through, a reform can be made. Adding laws into this reform that is bipartisan will increase the chances of it being passed. More features include asking nations for authorization to build a pipeline through their territory, building pipelines for oil or gas, detailed trade agreements that allow you to set the price, quantity, and duration of the agreement (Example: Russia's Natural Gas Agreement with China that will last for 20 years), the game also allows the construction of various buildings or transportations like oil and gas pipelines, high-speed trains, nuclear power plants, oil rigs, gas and oil fields, and even increasing the number of hospitals, homes, schools, or solar fields. The game also has a very complicated economic system. I have been having trouble with it, but I did have some success as Jordan earlier. Continuing on, the game is very recent. It isn't like SuperPower 2 where it was created just before the NATO expansion or the break-up of Serbia and Montenegro, but it was released in 2013, meaning it has the world's youngest country, South Sudan. The game features terrorist groups in every country, ranging from the Mafia to Total Jihad groups (Al-Quaeda). You have the options to infiltrate the groups if they live in your territory, to funding them with weapons, money, and 2 semi-trucks with rockets and explosives if they are in other countries to help them take down that country's government. But if you do this, you have the chance to be caught red-handed. And this will transfer into the news, and Parliment will impeach you. I suffered that while playing as Russia and funding New Zealand terrorists. The game offers so much detail to their options, like adding more medical staff and adding more police staff. You can also investigate politicians and well-known citizens to reveal a scandal to use against them, to spying on heads-of-state or countries to find evidence that will gain the approval of the United Nations Security Council and allow military action against the country. Which brings me to the Organizations of the game. The game has made Organizations possible, which bring various or all world organizations into the game including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, European Union, and North American Free Trade Agreement. It then gives you the option to create your own Organization, allowing an Economic Market (NAFTA), Producing Countries (OPEC), Monetary Union (EU), and Political-Military Organization (NATO). This then allows you to choose members states, the budget, the voting system, the secretary general's holding of the seat, and who the secretary general is. You can then meet to set the prices of the product, make changes, etc. Like with OPEC, you can propose to change the average oil price. You can also launch reelection campaigns, even visiting the Olympics, military barracks, and universities. Instead of a SuperPower 2 style diplomatic relations, there are two types of relations. First is economic. Just because the country does not favor you does not affect trade relations. Second is military, allowing certian permissions like allowing air, ground, and naval bases in your/their country while considering the amount, allowing you to edit this at any time via meetings with head-of-state. Diplomatic relations come with various things, like managing embassies, allowing nationals to enter or leave, and forcing ethnic Israeli's living in Lebanon to return. Lastly, the game makes it perfectly with this.As all military and geopolitical games have, the feature nuclear weapons. Naturally, this game has them. But for the first time, you need to go through politics when proceeding with a nuclear attack. First, you must authorize the use of nuclear weapons. Second, you must make a meeting with the Chief of the Army. Third, you must ask him to authorize the use of nuclear weapons. Forth, you must ask him for the code for the nuclear weapons. And the game never remembers it, You actually need to write it down. Lastly, enter your code when firing nuclear missiles. But in this game, it features something never seen in any game I have played - Chemical and bacteriological weapons. You can actually use the weapons hated internationally. Though it is almost difficult to use them, you need to have a high standing with the chief of the army. Authorize the use of chemical and bacteriological weapons, ask him to authorize their use, and if he allows it, you can freely launch chemical attacks against anyone. Beware - Using nuclear, chemical, and bacteriological weapons are EXTREMELY frowned upon domestically and internationally. If used, you will be thrown out of office, and if not that, the UNSC will send a resolution to authorize military intervention.Overall, the game is very fun. So far, I have not run into any major bugs like crashes or gameplay interventions. Only bug I have notices was on the Newspaper where it was supposed to say the President of Russia's name, but showed random lettering or coding. I rate it 8/10. If you love geo-political games and have major interests in politics, this game is perfect. Besides the 90s looking interface, no game has ever gone so in-depth. Many offical reviews say the same.

												At first, Masters of the World looks like a deep, engaging and thrilling simulator of worldwide politics. If you made the same mistake that I did by purchasing the $70 bundle with the game, updated content, and the modding tool, you'd better hurry and refund that. If you really want to see what this game has to offer then you should just buy the base game.Unfortunately, the problems with MotW appear immediately. Right off the bat, the tutorial was unable to figure out that I had successfully changed some spending priorities as it had instructed me to, preventing me from progressing further. Armed only with the knowledge of how to navigate the map and modify the budget, I tried to start a new game. It was extremely difficult selecting a leader that wasn't of the same party as the current leader, turning the start-up process into a mess as I accidentally changed unrelated settings attempting to figure out how to change the leader. I eventually figured it out - though I can't even remember how I did - and entered the game.Immediately, the game became campy and even amusing. To communicate to the player even basic messages, an ugly and poorly-rendered person takes over your screen to talk to you about how well you're doing. The voice acting was so robotic and unnatural, the first 7 hours I played I was certain it was just a text-to-speech software. These messages quickly become repetitive: whenever there is a terrorist cell in a foreign country, someone will come on the screen and deliver a useless, rambling explanation of the ""Brown model"" without giving you any real information (they'll mention percentages and numbers that sound important, but turn out to be repetitive filler that doesn't change situation to situation). Afterwords the game will give you a static text box telling you the real information: where the cell is, what it does and how to contact them. You can skip these messages (and thankfully by doing so you're not actually missing anything), but the fact that Eversim put so much effort into something so unnecessary - and in fact something that hinders the gameplay experience - shows where their priorities are. The rest of the game's graphics do not fare well, either. The game has extreme and severe lag somehow, even when countries are basically trees, lakes, and geometrically simple cities that consist of about a dozen buildings. As mentioned earlier, the character models look horrendous, but the developers seem to enjoy showing off. The interface is a problem (which is not uncommon for an Eversim game), with the developers trying to make fancy-looking infographics hidden behind dozens of menus and tabs.If these problems weren't major enough, the game is buggy, crashes very often, and Eversim has completely given up on it. Eversim has a history of spending about 6 months on a political game, updating it rarely for a 6-month period, and then disappearing to work on a sequel. Their sequel to this game is coming out soon (the release date has already passed with no announcement) and judging by the trailers, it preserves the terrible graphics and confusing interface. If Eversim settled on a game, kept updating it, used a reasonable price, and actually made a working tutorial, they wouldn't have a 42% positive score on Steam.			"

												Masters of the world - An amazing concept, if only the final product was as good.One of the few political simulators on the market; MOTW:GPS definitely has potential - but a lot more work needs to be done. Especially considering the dev team are asking for Â£39.99 to own a copy.This is much a message to the dev team as it is a review. If you truly love political sims you could look past the graphical glitches, or the horrifying voice acting and enjoy what this game has to offer. But if you expect something seamless and polished along the lines of the Tropico franchise - you'll be in for a shock.			"

You might think the game runs smoothly while in peace - maybe, but  when I tried to choose reactive rocket launchers, it constantly crashed. I can't envade or defend - the game is ruined. Pretty sure there are much more bugs.Also, I like achievemnts, but this game is totally lackingIf you are interested to try - download it on torrents, the devs didn't earn your support			"

												Besides the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ protection and the fact the modding tool requires a further $16.95-21 to obtain, this is probably one of the most expensive games out there. Even though I do want to support them... this is not cheap for me.			"

												ok so first i was in doubt because all of the bad review but iÂ´m so glad that i bought this game. i was looking for the real thing and i can say i found it.if you are looking for amazing graphics then this is NOT your game.if you are looking for massive battles to just conquer the world easily... this is NOT your game go buy something like AoE.but if you want a game where every action has a consecuence, where taking power is not easy, where staying in power is not easy, where you need to think far beyond the easy gathering of resources, then you have found the game.this game is so serious is almost crazy. even in the tutorial you can mess it up really bad.let me say this clearly enought... if you are dumb in political knowledge and ecomics you may want to rethink it before buying a GEOPOLITICAL simulator, good news is that there are links inside the game to teach you, so youll learn a lot.another thing to mention is that most of the bad comments on the games are not even related to the game and for $50 bucks i think the game is worth it, and if people buy it there should be no reason for the company to close. as for the bugs they reported i have not encounter any of them so far.do i recommend it? yes, i do. go ahead try to stay in power.

												Doesn't even start due to  a widespread commonly reported error that produces an 'EXCEPTION VIOLATION ACCESS' error message on start up. The developers are yet to sort out this problem that means many who buy the game and are not even able to start it, despite it being released over a year ago. It's a real shame that the developers havnt done anything to help fix this problem that affects many players within a very small fanbase to begin with. This is a form of compatibility error of some kind, but the PCs of those affected meet the recommended PC specification advertised. A shame nothing has been done by Eversim who are reluctant to refund those affected or sort out the problem.			"

												The game is brilliant in theory, however, in practise, they got it horribly wrong. The UI is laggy and buggy, the ""modding"" extension doesn't work properly, when you have modded a game, and try and play it, half of the things you have changed mess up or just don't change. The game is pretty boring after playing it 4/5 times. I would only recomend buying this game to someone who would be willing to take it apart and rebuilding it to make it's functionality better.			"

												I've put in around 10 hours now, so hopefully this enables me to give a helpful overview of the game.First of all, if you don't have time to read everything, I can honestly say that the game is not worth the current asking price of 50 EUR or your regional equivalent but I can recommended it at a lower price. Hope that helps.For the rest of you, we can go into a bt more depth. Starting with the positives, I was very impressed with the amount of detail the game goes into - from currency unions to closing the borders the game has plenty of option to sink you teeth into. Where you'll find yourself somewhat frustrated however, is that many of the options are actually 'non-options' depending on the political slant of your party.When you pick a nation, you are bound to the ruling party and it's politics and thus taking any nation with a clear bias toward the right or left of the political spectrum to the other side - or even the centre - appears to be very difficult. Aside from the effort it can take to push through policies in the face of rebellion within your own party, long term they can actually choose to oust you, regardless of your adherence to democratic principles or your level of popularity.In my North Korea playthrough I discovered this the hard way. Despite the huge economic and social benefits of opening up the society and my unbelieveable 100% popularity rate, my party took me out and shot me at dawn with zero interference from my alleged millions of supporters.Any significant change, even seemingly for the better can trigger widespread and disruptive protests which don't seem to subside all that quickly, even if you begin to introduce reforms that are being requested.The interface is clunky at best, the game is not remotely impressive graphically, the voice acting is very off - my North Korean health minister had the most amazing, broad Irish accent - and, in the English version at least, emails and newspaper articles can sometimes make no sense whatsoever.BUT, it is far from all bad. As stated above, you have a lot of options and can descend into dangerously geeky levels of play. aside from the rarer occasions when your actions trigger unbelieveable responses, the game is largely authentic feeling and your actions do have a satisfying weight to them. The ability to fight in real time, or even leave the nitty gritty to the competent military AI, is also very well executed and you have a great choice of options open to you upon victory, from annexation or colonisation of the defeated foe, to a regime change. Borders can be renegotiated and the espionage system is one of the best I've encountered.Where this game is likely to excel though is in Multiplayer, the range of overt and covert actions you can take to destabilise, attack or prop-up your neighbours is truly wonderful and I suspect even more rewarding when the ally or opponent is a human being.The raw data used for the core modelling seems pretty solid however, you can break the game and your own immersion from time to time so certainly do not expect the political modelling to be bulletproof.Comprehensive modding support is built into the game and I would expect this to be where the biggest strides in improving the game will be made.In summary, if you have friends to play against or a sincere passion for political simulators then this is worthwhile pick-up, but I urge everyone to wait for it to be on sale or you will feel more than a little taken advantage of. If you are a casual player or are considering this as an impule buy, I'd suggest giving it a wide bearth or picking up the excellent and polisihed, if far less detailed - Civilization IV or V.			"

												Despite of a few bugs Geopolitical Simulator 3 is an exceptionally clever and entertaining game! Of course strategic gaming must be your thing in order to fully appreciate MOW. It has more body than for example Civilization (which in itself is also a good game). It is very interesting to see what influence your various decisions have in the field of domestic or foreign policy, financial health, economic growth or social aspects.  Also the causal relations between investing/cutting in a particular sector, creating contracts, growth, unemployment, production, trade balance, budget deficit, privitization etc..etc.. is very realistic, interesting and entertaining. Fun to read the newspaper on which impact your various decisions have, how it is presented and how well it is received by public opinion. One of the things I have learned is that you certainly can't satisfy all of the people and organizations in a country. And most of the time it is a real challenge just to keep your head above the water. But all the more satisfying it is when you do manage to create a contract, see that the invested tax payer dollars create economic growth an jobs etc..etc..Untill now I played only USA and I noticed that you realy have to balance between containing the budget deficit, stimulating economic growth, your popularity rating and your dependence on congress which you will need in order to push foreward your policy. You come to understand and realize the dilemma's most leaders also must have in real life! Also, don't trust the republicans hahaha. If you for example ask the head of the republican party to support you on a bill in congress, he says he will do so, but instead they stabb you in the back once it is voted on (that is if they don't agree with the bill of course). All in all I am very enthousiastic about this game.If I had to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10, I would say 11.			"

												This game is a nearly total waste of money.  It plays like 1995 and runs even worse.  My laptop will not run it (Lenovo y510p) and 2 machine activation means installing it on anything else sucks up the 50 bucks I was dumb enough to drop on this game.  It has changed my steam practices, as getting a refund from them for a game that won't work is impossible and the customer service for this game is pretty much pointless. I wish I never would have bought this.			"

												I've played previous Geoploitical Sim Games and enjoyed them. They've always had their problems and this is no exception. Like in previous games the economic effect of policies seems well modeled but the reaction of the voters is utterly unpredictable. Riots in the streets over minor policy changes makes the game unplayable if you're trying to be a moderate. The war system UI is also utterly unusable making it very difficult to play even as a war game.I love what they're trying to do and hope that their next release does a better job but I doubt I'll play this again.

												This product is so bad it's a scam.It's worthless for gaming and education. It's riddled with bugs. The ""help"" files are links to Wikipedia pages about real life (if you don't crash). There are a number of screens and windows that require obscure workarounds to even operate, and often ""forget"" the things you've done. Windows you're working in randomly close. Values randomly change. Other world leaders offer you contracts that they can't fulfill, and reject the contract after you accept it. Notices from advisors are substanceless and repetitive - they do not have dialogue options that are meaningful, and you are still left with just as much information as you had before. There is no history of your actions, or previous values for anything. Some screens won't even display the correct current values. You cannot expedite the passing of laws even in the worst autocratic nations, and people will revolt while it's being passed for three weeks.This game is a J-O-K-E. If it were implemented in a spreadsheet instead, and free, I might play it at work for like five minutes or so. This is awful and I want my money back because the developer doesn't deserve it. This isn't even something one department or a couple of people could be responsible for. It takes the fail of multiple departments to create something this bad, and then charge $50 for it. They probably also fired the few competent people they did have working there, just before they realized they did still need them.Other things you can do with $50:Dinner and drinks for yourself and a date <3Order pizza for a large group of friendsBuy three or four better indie gamesPay your internet billSend your mother flowersMovie tickets for fourDrive to Denver and backBuy a mouse that lists the amount of DPI on the box in bold letters because it has the most of them...Do you see what you've taken? This represents an entire day's work for most of us. I want recompense for this, for all of us, and I have a solution: Customer Service. All of you (especially upper management) will provide telephone customer service for your game. We will call you and ask you ""Hi, how many more dog catchers do I need to prevent the Cat Lovers Society from revolting?"", or ""Whassa wi qua you *hiccup* and *jarbled static* ha ha right?"", or ""I'm trying to initiate a trade embargo on India and I need a graph of global imports and exports overlayed for the following commoditites..."", and you will administratively access our game clients and provide this information to us in real time. Also, if you could just turn the pages of the newspaper for me that would be really helpful.			"

												First impressions: http://www.cublikefoot.com/masters-of-the-world-geopolitical-simulator-3-first-impressions/Masters of the World - Geopolitical Simulator 3 (quite the title we got there) is, well, a geopolitical simulator. It is a lot of fun to play, but don't expect to take over other countries without repercussions.The game is complex. Really, really complex. There's probably still a lot of things I don't know about the game. It goes real deep into just about every aspect there is to managing a modern-day country. The learning curve is insane. You'll need to spend a lot of time in the game just figuring out the various changes that can be made to your country in order to keep citizens happy, which is quite the difficult task.Your relations with other countries in the game can easily be severed if you choose to attack another country. This is not the type of game where you're able to just ""conquer"" countries. Doing so will result in the entire UN being against you. In fact, when I took over Georgia (I was playing as Russia at the time), South Korea called for military intervention from UN members.When voting came around for this, I voted against it, which prevented military intervention. How? Well, Russia is one of the five permanent member of the UN, so if they don't agree, then it gets vetoed automatically, even though EVERY OTHER COUNTRY voted for military intervention. I used this to my advantage and continued to take over two other countries before being executed by my own army in Moscow (oops!). Yeah, Russia's citizens were not happy with my actions, even with a 49% approval rating.Masters of the World is a really fun game. It's a fantastic experience and I highly recommend it, if you're willing to take it seriously.

												There are two things to know when deciding whether or not to buy this game-1. The menus are clunky, the GUI is clunky, it often lags for no reason, and things don't always make sense.2. Despite all of this, the reviews for this game are overly negative. You can have fun here if you try.As I said, it's clunky and unoptimized and the developers don't seem to care. However, there is something here. As far as gameplay, it IS the most realistic representation of modern day country management, though that might not be saying much. Personally, I spent most of my time playing around in the mod DLC, where you can create alternate nations and scenarios.The game is also super overpriced. Do not pay the full price for this game if you aren't rich.You might be wondering right now why I gave this game a positive recommendation. The game isn't the best, the developers don't deserve it. Well, quite simply, I spent 48 hours in this game and had fun. I don't know why, but I did. Make of that what you will.			"

												Such a great game. Don't listen to the idiots who played for 10 minutes and then judged it, it's worth the money. Just takes some getting used to. The wargame is in-depth and exceptional, you can play as any country you wish (With a few exceptions including city-states such as the Vatican and Monaco) You can play a multitude of scenarios ranging from World War 3 to Chilean Tourism, the gameplay is astoundingly realistic, ranging from issues about social mores to the military. The only thing I can say I don't like about the game is interacting with other countries, which is quite limited. The game does not include things such as Sanctions, and the AI is pretty trigger happy with the ""Attack Country"" button if you provoke them. In contrast to today, where economic sanctions can send a clear message to back down. Over all, a very great game. I would recommend this any day. NOTICE: This isn't some Paradox grand strategy game, this is a Geo-Political Simulator. Know the difference.			"

They are very good and honorable, if you want a refund, they will give you a refund, they put patches for the game. It is a very good game if you like politcs, as it simulates real-life politics. You can try to develop the economy, change laws, make legal homosexuailty marriage, nationalize an industry, declare war, join or create organizations, tons of stuff. However it has cons as well, as in it has a lot of bugs, so make sure to check the official forums for help and tips on getting around them.

I haven't been able to even play the game (it's been almost TWO WEEKS SINCE I BOUGHT IT), it crashes right after the loading screen, stating: EXCEPTION_VIOLATION_ACCESS. I've tried contacting the developers four times. Nothing. I tried Steam support and several forums. To no avail. It seems that Steam is not really willing to give their clients a refund, or at least admiting that THE GAME IS NOT WORKING. And it's not just with me, several people are reporting the same error.I must say I am VERY frustrated, and I do not have the intention of ever buying anything else from Steam.			"

												if you are deciding whether or not to purchase this game you may want to read this review.... personally I love this game, it is really fun because of the endless ways to run your nation. (also endless ways for your nation to end) It takes into account many of real world limiting factors. for example, you can't just take full control over your people(unless you get the 2014 add on). the senate and parliment will most likley try to stop you, also your people will revolt and you will most likely get killed be forced to leave or have your own military go against you. All I'm trying to say is if you want to feel what it's like to run a country for real or if you want to reign supreme and conquor your enemies and want a challenge while doing it then get this game. however if you aren't looking for a challenge and you just want to conquor the world, it is possible. However if you don't know how to get out of tricky situations then you might not want to get it.  I would Definitly recommend this game if you meet the above categories.			"

												Um ok i don't really know what drug compelled me to buy this piece of TRASH but i literally loaded up the game started playing and instantly lost. Unless you're the president of uzbekistan or some rubbish you'll never win. Also so much money to buy in the first place that i probably am in debt to the government now. Thanks asian people.			"

												This was just a major disappointment. Cartoony and unrealistic feeling, I had a hard time suspending reality and trying to get through the awful UI to be able to really use this game as it was intended. The core idea is probably a solid one, but for the price coupled with the execution is absolutely lacking. I made a big mistake.			"

												The developer of the game does wanna show some good thoughts and concepts about the world politic and economic affairs. However the game is full of severe bugs. You will get the manpower bug when you annex a nation, and you will still suffer the bug sooner or later even if didn't goin to war. I would recommend the game if they fix all the bugs and make it playable someday...			"

												I'll try to keep this rather short...The idea of this game is vast and quite exciting at first... yeah there's a but coming... BUT after spending over 50 hours trying to find ways around all the bugs, the complicated dynamics and gameplay, I'm comvinced there is no hope for this game. It's $50.00 and it wasn't worth $10 simply because of the constant bugs. I tried and tried but I'm done with this game. The devs haven't seemed to care or drop the price in light of all the issues, so I'm out. Stay away from this game if you value your money.			"

												Don't buy the game, if you do, please don't get coaxed into buying its 'expantions' they do nothing to improve the game's obvious lack of development quality. Truly is a shame, it had so much potential, but bugs are ever present and there is rarely an update to fix it. It is an unfinished game, a cash grab, theft...			"

												This game is pretty much Democracy 3, but on a level of depth and complexity that old Paradox games don't even touch this.   That is fine but this game suffers from a few major problems, one being the tutorial teaches you pretty much nothing, also this game is pron to crashing and it loves to have your leadkilled  or have a military coup, and the problem with that isn't so much that it happens but because it dosn't tell you why.  This game has so much potential that I got sucked into it but between the glitches and me having no idea what half the buttons due or how to even play the game I cannot recomend this to anyone.  In all don't buy, but try to get the next game to be actualy proper and really good because this franchise needs to exist.			"

												SCAM! that is the most fitting word i can think of. 175 ""playable"" countries, when it should be 175 UN PLAYABLE countries. hell i cant even see the main â¥â¥â¥â¥ing menu, so i paid $53.94 on a game thats just going to sit there. I am having to ask steam for a refund and a CLEAR WARNING to people that this game may litteraly be un playable, hell, now that i am thinking of it, i paid $54 for a 30 second video as the trailer is the most i see of this thing. now, obviously, i cant tell you to not buy the game as it is your decision, but i do ask this, do you want to risk your hard earned cash on a 30 second video? that is what you need to ask yourself. now in the case i dont get a refund, one of these â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s will need to expect a lawsuit, because you can bet yourâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥one will be headed to one of these companys. so, please, dont be me, dont waste near $60 on a 30 second video. i have seen people say infeastation survivor stories is a scam and dont buy it, but how much is it, like $4.99? and that damn game was at least playable. like i said i paid close to the price of a brand new triple a game, only to recieve a 30 second video. i am â¥â¥â¥â¥ingâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and before any of you hound me about your game being playable, just know that i have done everything to try and fix it, and yes i even downloaded that damn xvid.org thing. so, to sum it up, this is in my case and other cases, a full blown scam, and yes other cases, i googled it to see if there was a fix, but nope just a lot of people complaining about this issue to the devs, and the devs do nothing, i have seen and heard people say, try turning off fullscreen mode, and i have tried this, it makes no difference for me and many others. so, to sum it up in one word, scam. but like i said its up to you to decide what to do, but my advice, dont do what i did, dont ignore the bad reviews. if you want to support this company (Eversim) i can recommend Rulers of Nations. thats the whole reason i got my self in this â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up situation, i really enjoy rulers of nations, and wanted to support the company buy buying a game, not a damn video that i can youtube for free.Edit: The 1 hour of :Game time is me trying it over and over. still nothing...Edit #2: after Uninstalling and Reinstalling, i am now getting this error: Internal error 00000005Edit #3: even the devs dont support their game, i am having this issue and have contacted the support from their own site but my email cant go to that address. this ""Game"" is completeâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥Edit 4 final edit: this is the email i got finally, i had to use this email to get my money back. HelloThe error file shows that the problem is OpenGL version : it is an old version, not fully compatible with new one (most of the driver version are at least 3.0, or or 4.0).If you cannot find drivers  more up to date, can you install the game on another PC ?--> If not, unfortunatelly we cannot do anything... Please ask for a refund at Steam's. Sorry about that.Best regards,Eversim supportSo my words of advice is figure out if the drivers and everything can run it. i was bummed to not be able to play it. p.s. i have tried it on another pc.

												I have played this game for a few hours that I have kind of enjoyed. The reasons that I didn't enjoy it and still won't recommend it are that the game is 1. Full of bugs that have been around ever since the game came out (2013) and yet they weren't fixed. It isn't a minor bug it could actually get to a point were you want to actually break your PC to pieces because of these stupid and dumb bugs. 2. How the company sells the game and mods for just too much !!... I actually am looking for a refund. Too terrible to even consider !!			"

												Great game despite its faults. You have to be a political/economic NERD to fully appreciate it I think. And it has an insane learning curve to it. I had to just crack out on it and fail 100 times and read everything I could find about it to really understand all of the mechanisms and the action/reaction principal of the game. It takes time/dedication. But once you master the ""balancing act"" of socioeconomic and geopolitical chess - it becomes a fun and addicting game. It's about as Grand strategy as you can get. Did they miss the mark? Yes, but they have the right Idea. It would be cool if some real money could get behind a game like this. Not saying THIS company- but a serious effort for a serious grand strategy game- Never happen though it's such a small niche market. So I'm stuck with this until another Grand strategy game comes out that lets me Legalize Marijuana and Gay Marriage in North Korea.......			"

												I have played this game for some time and I have to say I quite enjoy appointing myself as dictator and arresting people for treason and whatever reasons I find. Experimenting with different sorts of government involvement in the economy, everything from a total govermental planned economy to a libertarian paradise (which made all the farmers in Norway revolt and I got killed by a bull) I wish they would update it a bit more, this game has so much more potential, and it seems as though the whole franchise is now about some horrible MMORPG looking thing that has about 3 players. I would reccomend this game if you are a sociopath or quite interested in international politics, I do enjoy this game a bit more than tropico as this has a bit more depth and seems a bit more realistic. E.g if you do decide to make a democratic western country into the autoritarian paradise of your dreams, NATO, the UN and everyone else will denounce you and kick you out of their bureocratic, bloated organizations. 10/10 in my book.Have not encountered any bugs/difficulties running this so far			"

This game has a great basic and god knows it could be in the $60 ~ $70 range to this day if it was maintained (regular managment, getting back with complains, solutions to solve crashes, fixing crashes, and all that jazz) point blank the basic requirements for releasing a game.*****NOTE: This game doesn't work the same for everyone different computers have different results - even still there will be crashes it just differs wether the crash is a majorly bad on or not.*****NOTE FOR DEVS (dout you'll see this): This game has the potintal to go places, make a but load of money, or whatever your reason for making it - Basiclly fixing what has been broken will bring more people more people = more money, more money = creation in next of series, and Creation in next of series = more buyers than previous game = MORE MONEY AND FAN BASS FOR ANYTHING ELSE YOU COULD PUBLISH!!!!! Also you should know that releasing a defective product like this is asking for one of us american to sue you, because that one of the thing we do best......*****LOVE THE GAME - NOW START ON THE WORK have a good day/night/whatever =)			"

												First time opening this game and it auto crashed... Finally started to play it and it's laggy as hell - despite reducing all graphics options it still takes far too long for clicking something to work. I'm running with an i7 , 16gb ram,  1 gb graphics.Looking past the lag and auto crashing, playing the game feels like playing the lottery. Make a few decisions, see the consequences - but regardless of the consequence, get no practical feedback on why that was the consequence. So you can't even play a few times and learn, you literally have to play with a debugging hat on, logically using powers of deduction to eventually understand the consequence. E.G. ""You got expelled from the EU because of your policy"". What policy, I'd changed a few. So restart... change one less... expelled. restart, change another less... expelled. Finally figure it out... The game is tedious, has great potential, but given lack of active community (compared to any paradox game) resolution of the bugs doesn't feel promising enough to spend more time playing.			"

												I am very sad to say that I cannot recommend this game, I purchased it two weeks ago because it looked like fun on YouTube. When I installed it and tried to play it it would not work and gave me an error everytime, I registered and did everything thast was required. I looked through the community discussions only to find that I was not the only one with the problem and it was fairly common and even after contacting steam support we found no solution. I urge you not to spend the $49.99 on this game and risk it not working but rather invest $9.99 on games like SuperPower 2 or Supreme Ruler franchise.			"

												It's a fun game to start off, but thats about where it ends, it has flaws. For example, how boring it gets. You basically manage the economy forever, with the sole focus on getting constantly re-elected, if an ally or neighbour goes to war and you go to right them the world, including your country goes batshit crazy for being at war. Not to mention they will NEVER peace out normally even after the original 2 have peaced.The combat is very clunky and, I must say just plain annoying to manage, not because its complex or indepth, its just simply annoying. You have cities and military bases around your entire country they you have to individually draw troops from, [Countries like China are... lets not go there.] You can leave the A.I to command you army of course, but they send in single units at a time in a long line that die every time they hit an inch of the enemy territory and are wiped out one by one.The Economic and country managment part of the game is pretty fun, although the lack of tooltips are sometimes frusterating, it would be nice to know effects or other such anquities if you are new to the game or don't know all the political terms.All in all, the game starts to get very repetitive, Economy - Elections - Economy - Elections -National disaster, [All the disasters do, you literally throw money at it and the problem dissapears] then maybe - war - [in which you are demonized even for defending an ally country, in which they will never peace out of]Not to mention! After all the gameplay spoofs, it has DOUBLE DRM, which the Dev's don't care that we don't like it, They do it anyway.DRM, poor combat, clunky A.I, Boring gameplay after an hour, 4/10 Wait for sale, or do not get.EDIT:: I also forgot about the crashes, 3 crashes in an hour which is ridiclious to!

												The modding and customization tools are so restrictive and poorly-designed that they're basically unusuable.  Most variables can't be modified at all, and the few that can be changed are locked behind two separate DLCs.  The interface is legitimately one of the worst I've ever seen in a game.  The English translation is pretty inadequate.  The documentation is absolutely terrible and the tutorial might as well not be there.  Oh, and the game is incredibly buggy.  In short, this game is awful, don't waste your money.			"

The price is very high and never comes down but it is still in my top 5 games I've bought on Steam and has a huge replay value as you can do just about anything and you can choose any nation in the world.

												Has potential, but the developer sadly left the last two games unfinished and along with it, my commitment to buy any other games they produce, which is a shame.			"

												game is garbage, would get more entertainment burning a $50 bill, even with opening every single port on my computer in both tcp and udp and then spending hours confirming each port the game still refuses to allow multiplayer play...totally garbage			"

												Don't waste your money. The game is broken on so many levels. Ran a constant budget deficit of about 11% only for it to change to 19% the next year on Jan 1st, for no apparent reason. Riots broke out as I had to cut spending and raise taxes. Waste of time.			"

												Welp, there goes 68+ dollars down the Drain, I want a refund, but because ive played this crap game more than 2 hours steam wont give me my money back. Its buggy, not very user friendly, and not very well done, it seems unfinished, and did I mention it was buggy? I mean, the only reason Ive played it so long was trying to fix the bugs in it, I'd dowload a fix file, play the game for a while, and it would crash. I get another fix, play test it, and whole cities on the map would be missing. I bought it because there was no other way to play test it, there is no demo for this game, which sucks. I'm never going to play it again, ever. It just too buggy and unfinished.			"
