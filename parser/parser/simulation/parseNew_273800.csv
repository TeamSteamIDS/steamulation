												Guys, the idea is great, but... Please, try to test the game before releasing it. Especially, if it is not Early Access game. For the God's sake! Physics! How? Have you tried to tie the log to the horse? Have you seen, how it is looks like? If not - I suggest you to try it!			"

												This is great game, if player is 5-6 years old. Other case, this is crap. First try i have feeling that what year is it? 1996, 2006, 2016. Published 2016, graphics kind of 2006, and game engine 1996. Don't waste your money for this, it needs major update before it's playable, and known UIG's strategy, that update will never come.			"

												Dont buy it unless you like chopping trees down because thats what your going to be doing...The idea is good now so far i have only played 3.7hrs of the game the lack of instructions didnt help when i first started but keep going you easily pick it up unless you get bored in the process.Would i recommend this game ? Well so far because its had so many negitive reviews am going give it a thumbs up based on it is what it is cutting down trees and expanding your company.But the gameplay good be better.I personally enjoy farming simulator 2015 the forestry aspect in that game i enjoy more than this  so if you havent played that game do your history well before purchasing forestry 2017 as you may well be asking for a refund.So i will give it a thumbs up nice idea could be better it is what it is chopping down trees and growing your company.

												I really don't get why so much hate on this game. It does what it says and does it nicely. The gameplay is smooth enough, graphics aren't top notch but not ugly or outdated as people say it is.You get to experience a perfect one kind of simulation:You got to take care of a forest and its differnt types of trees. Master using the machines and the money available will INCREASE a lot, helping you out on the economy side of the game. There is a nice bunch of tools and machines - from chainsaws to harvesters, cranes, trucks or tractors - at your disposal, you tend to orders and try to max your skills within different areas of the gameplay.The world where you play cicles day and night, which end to be two total different styles of play in my opinion. Concerning the graphic design of the game, I found the HUD very easy to understand and use. It is my first time playing this type of game (Forestry) so I cannot compare to the previews editions, but this one right here is a great game and I am pretty sure you won't regret getting it. "

												Forestry 2017 - The Simulation is exactly what it says it is and what it is supossed to do. Just by watching the trailer you will get aclear understanding of what the game is about, but I can further explain that you will play with lots of tools associated with, of course, the theme: forestry simulation. My experience with it was very pleasant, smooth gameplay together with fancy visuals and neat sounds. I particularly like to try mastering the machines as soon as possible because it will help a lot on winning more revenue from all actions. The main purpose will be to expand your company, and to do so you will need to sell a lot of woosd logs and other related products.Forestry 17 is a great title, aware of any other forestry simulator out there. BUT!!!!! ---> Needs Steam Trading Cards!!!			"

												A few people complained that all you do is chop wood. That's kinda the whole point of the game. It delivers what it promises: Running a forestry business. It's like saying that fishing simulator involves too much fishing. I personally like this game a lot. I've already upgraded my horse to a peice of machinery and money started rolling in. I'm now saving for the next big upgrade.			"

												well, I played this game for an hour and I have to say I also enjoyed a lot ... the game is very nice and not boring ... I love simulation games I haven't found other forestry games to compare this with, but so far it looks pretty solid, and although there's still a little something to improve the game is already very nice and well organized. The commands to use are few and easy to remember, the game map is very very big but thanks to the little browser that is located on the bottom left of the game window you orient very well! There is a lot of work to do in the forest, cutting trees, selling them and always in the company of a horse that helps us in our work! Finally, you say, well if you are fans of the genre I'd recommend it!			"

												Get this game if you like the feel of nature and working on building your own company.because thats what the game is aboutit starts as a wood cutter with just a chainsaw and horse,you slowly build up your ranks and get more choices of tools to use-This game is also good for the RPG fans, you can level up in it!The more trees you chop, the more money you get, the better things you can buyFor me as a mainly-rpg player, this game felt like its worth playing-The graphics of this game are awesome too!If you think about it, the game is only around 1GB in size, and has better graphics than many new games i played.-Theres 2-3 small bugs i encountered, which are rather funny, but nothing game breakable(just saying ""horse + mountain"", sounds familiar? haha)-i would totally recommend this game, its good!

If you are wondering why I'm like the only one leaving a positive review be sure to check out the video above, as far as simulators go I actually had a bit more fun with this game than I probably should have. + Good country / rock soundtrack+ A nice progression system where you eventually work your way up to better vehicles, along with hiring staff and so fourth (although I didn't make it that far)+ Controls are pretty simple but everything seems to work well (I was surprised at how well the Jeep drove, even off-road it was pretty realistic)+ The map is HUGE with multiple sawmills you will never run out of trees (well...eventually you might)+ Visually it looks pretty nice, with a day/night cycle, although the houses and textures could be improved a bit.- The game feels lifeless, there is only a couple other player models besides yourself in the world- Very repetitive- Not a whole lot of content or things to do, you will grind a lot just to unlock a few vehicles that will make things slightly easier- No tutorial~ I do feel like the game could have actually been a bit more enjoyable if it supported co-op multiplayer although that's hard to expect from a simulation game.As far as simulators go this is actually pretty decent.

Enhances the experience by a lot, second well if you like forestry, this is definetley the simulation game for you. I think the horse is such a troll aspect of the game, its honestly super funny.

												As I loaded my lip with Copenhagen and poured whiskey into my glass, I felt the hair on my face thicken. Long have I awaited the moment when I can become a true lumberjack. Day 1 into my new profession was simple and yet ultimate bliss. I started it all off by picking up my trusty steed sprinkles. I assume I raised the horse however the whiskey had already began to run its course altering my thought process. As we began our 35 yard adventure to the nearest tree I began to grow hair on my chest at the thought of my first kill. Without further hesitation I spam every button, eventually finding my chainsaw, and cutting the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ down Gears of War style. Defeated at last, the monster fell.The corpse, laying gently on the ground, was staring at me. With sap gushing out of its newly opened wound like a river after a heavy flood. I look back at it with nothing more than a grin, while the humming of my chainsaw was teeth rattling music to my ears. I couldn't hold back any longer I began to dismember him. Limb. by. Limb.Day 2 basically the same thing but at this point I was already way too drunk to care about the minor details.Day 3 i""m reely dunk loolThe game isn't ""bad"", but it's not the best thing I've ever played. It has bugs, glitches and other stuff but it plays just fine. It just needs to be polished up. It is exactly how they describe it on the store page. You cut ♥♥♥♥ing trees.If you want to support the game, buy it. If not, then don't. Simple.			"

												I know this company doesn't exactly have a great reputation as far as standing behind their games and I've been pretty disappointed a couple of times myself. But in all fairness, I've played this game a short bit and it was at least ""OK"". It ain't exactly epic and there are things I would add to it, but I did find it entertaining so far and intend to go back and play it some more. Considering Steam's new refund policy, if you think you might like it, it might be worth a try because you can always get your money back. A lot depends on what you think you expect the game to be... It's pretty basic and uncomplicated. At least I haven't found any glaring bugs or anything like that yet.I'd describe the game as a basic simulation in which you start off with a horse (with single log trailer) and a chainsaw. It seems like you can pretty much fall any tree in sight of the town you start in, saw it into 4 sections, then haul each section (one-by-one) back to the lumber mill for money. There's a light RPG element as you gain experience/level for selling logs, for which you get a point to allocate toward a skill (higher selling prices for logs, cheaper equipment prices, etc.).I've only gotten so far in the game as of this review, but after level 3, you can buy a garage (which opens up the ability to buy tractors and other logging equipment... Couldn't afford them yet myself). A level 6 you can buy an office to accept contracts and so on. In higher levels, it appears (I haven't got that far yet) that you can hire employees, possibly buy the lumber mill, make stuff to sell there, etc.Anyway, I think this game may suit some, but not others. For me, I give it a tentative thumbs up, subject to change. I know buying again from this company is scary, I almost didn't do it either. But so far, even though there's things I think they could/should add, I do like it better than anything else I've bought from them. And I haven't seen much about the game itself except people angry at the company for past burns (rightfully so). So, I thought I'd try to post something informative to help those on the fence. Good luck with your choice.			"

												Pros: It's a pretty straight forward game with control suggestions in the lower right corner, which I liked. It was a good click-then-achievement type game, especially where people are interested in linear goals and clear-cut objectives. I liked the wavy grass! The physics could be quite entertaining in the game. I count this as a pro because it provided some comic relief. Who knows where the tree's going next?!?! NO ONE! Cons: The lighting at night was pitch black, which most games there's SOME lighting so you can make sure you're not walking into walls and stuff...I'd recommend a bit more ambient lighting. The controls could use a little work. My poor horse got stuck going in circles a lot. :( Poor horsie. I think if the vehicles didn't get stuck in a perpetual circle motion occassionally the controls would be just fine.			"

												I tried to give this game a decent go, however after just an hours play i was greatly disappointed. You start off with the horse, which is okay i guess. But as soon as you gain the funds to purchase the first logging trailer, the controls are that badly configured that i had spent 2 whole game days just trying to load them.There is no way of slowing down time and as soon as night sets in, you may aswell give up as there are no rear lights on your tractor/horse etc.The only thing that did work well with this game was the refund system.
