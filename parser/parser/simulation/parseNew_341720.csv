												Interesting little experiment is this game. A literal fishbowl (or pond as it were) and a self contained ecosystem that you tweak by spawning various critters (some fish, some shellfish, an otter) and by adjusting the oxygen content, which adjusts the toxicity of the water and from what I can tell, the lifespans of the fishies.It's a free title, and an interesting way to spend ten or twenty minutes. After that, the charm sort of wears out and you are left wondering why the otter never needs to come up for air, lol.Interesting enough to be worth your time, but not enough here to hold your interest for long. I'd give it a 6 out of 10 (mostly because it was free, otherwise I would rate this more like 4 out of 10), and hope that the developer explores this genre a bit more and possibly creates something a bit more detailed. It has the potential to be a very cool simulation game with the proper time and dedication. As it is, you will find it relaxing but probably wont ever play it again.			"

												Really not what I would describe as a game, I think ""meditation"" comes closer.  While at first it seems like this is just moving wallpaper, the pond will become sick without your intervention.  There is a careful balance that needs to be maintained. If there are too many predators, they will eat all the small fish and then eventually starve. Without bottom feeders dangerous toxins will start to build up and you can watch as they travel up the food chain.  This environment really pulls you into the ebb and flow of the pond's ecosystem without being too stressful. I found Among Ripples to be a great way to unwind and take my mind off of other things. I also loved the watercolor art style. The music dose get a bit repetitive after a while, but it was innocuous enough not to be too annoying. Still, some more verity in the music would be nice. I think the game could also be expanded with different ecosystems; perhaps a saltwater tide-pool or tropical river. For a free game, I think it dose really well though.			"

												I've only spent 10 minutes on this game and unfortunately that's as about as long as it lasts, the concept is very sound and I must admit when I saw it i was imagining something like Darwin Pond or Simlife so I was a little disappointed when I found out it was a simple what if flash game. You'll start with the pond and can add different creatures depending on which part of the pond you choose to click on, naturally I found all the creatures spawn by themselves at some point and you really need to add all creatures to create a working eco-system, now if only the pond was much larger instead of cramming many hostile creatures into one small space (imagine if you put 5 phiranas and 5 goldfish in a small fishtank then just ignored them for a few weeks) After this the only other option I found to have had was to control the oxygen levels of the water (I would have liked to have controlled the PH levels though without using just clams which makes it more of an arcade aspect than a simulation) this is turn allowed me to see low oxygen means no algae and fish swim lower and that was really it.I'm going to recommend this game because I love the idea behind it and that it may be a brilliant concept for a much deeper gaming experience to come, it reminded me a hell of a lot of the Virtual Sea Monkeys game I played as a child so happy memories abound! I'm giving this a 6 out of 10, purely on the basis that I think this is a concept demo for a much larger game due out in the near future!			"

												Others say that it's just a boring game where you click on the nests and spawn fishes but the reason they see it that way maybe is because they actually don't understand how the game really works. You have to know how much of each fish will you spawn, how much oxygen should be present on the pond, etc. Your fishes won't grow much if they can't survive due to certain factors. The oxygen level also plays a role in the game. The game could have been better if there was a saving system or the pond can be expanded but hey, it's a free a game so there's no use complaining.This game is very relaxing with good art and music. If you're a looking for a relaxing game simulator with a small download size then I recommend this to you.			"

												It's fascinating how 'that' simple game can give you some kind of satisfaction and even reflections. Yes, it's very simple and small, has only one music but it is a great game. It isn't hard but you smile when you make a functional ecosystem, and you think when your biocoenosis is dying. As i mentioned before it has only one track but it's oddly satisfying and peaceful. I'm looking forward for more games from this studio (can be more complicated). First game which made me write a review.			"

												First of all, I would like to say that this game is good. Not great, but pretty good in the sense that this is a cool idea with a bit of potential to it. I really like the cut-out and painted art style that strikingly reminds me of the children's picture books that I used to read all the time when I was little. Technically, the mechanics of the game are simple: click on certain objects and spaces in the pond and different animals will spawn. Though not entirely clear, I think the premise is to get the ecosystem of the pond to take care of itself as you try to repair it and get it back on it's feet again, so to speak. Then basically the rest of the time, you're monitoring the ponds inhabitants as they're born, eaten, or die from old age. I notice that the longer they stay in the pond, they're skin textures change (which is, I assume, is them aging...?) Another thing I started to notice is that there are many things that happen that the game doesn't tell you about, which gives some people, like me, the urge to figure it out. For example, what is the darkened haze that starts to rise in the background that starts from the bottom of the pond? Is it a good or a bad thing? I've tried several attempts to get it to raise it higher, but wasn't sure how to keep it that way. I digress, though... Even though this game isn't as complex as they advertise it to be, I have the feeling that it has the potential to become that way. And as people below in the reviews say that it's just relaxation simulator, or what have you, I still think there's more to the game than that. Not only that, IT'S FREE! So good on you, developer. I would like to see this expanded, and even play some of your future creations, if possible.  "

Among Ripples is an artistic ecological simulator. Help a pond maintain a delicate balance with its aquatic population as you add additional specimen to it while keeping in check and limiting predators versus their preys.Pros: It takes no time getting started when beginning a new game, compensating for the lack of a save feature. The game is very soothing, the music being calm and the background having all the appearances of hand painting. Seasons cycle as the canvas switches from shades of greens, to yellows, reds and pinks. The animals grow and their textures and shapes (length, width) change depending on what they eat. The pond's ecosystem affect its ecology, and you'll see it ever changing as you regularly reintroduce species to readjust the balance in hope of making it self-sustaining for as long as possible, the challenge being not in keeping every species fed, but on keeping the preys numerous enough to reproduce at an equal or faster rate that they are killed. The beauty of this is that it's a self-determining goal, as the game itself doesn't hold any score or give any objectives out right.Cons: The quantity of species is fairly limited, and maintaining each isn't ultimately required, as animals often have alternative method of feeding. The music is limited to a single track that plays over and over again. It's not an annoying song by any means, but having a small variety from game to game would be appreciated, perhaps the same for the background canvas which you entirely ignore and forget it's there to see after a short while playing.Verdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!I'm actually surprised at how much I will recommend this game. It's not for everyone, of course, but it's as legit a casual game as any solitary games out there, except for how calming and relaxing it feels when playing. I'd meditate to that type of music! Oh, and it's free.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												A very simple game, that is neither diverse in its species nor in its gameplay. It is pretty enough to watch, with a soft palette and watercolour like feel, but will unfortunately not hold attention long.It is lacking in complexity, a few small features, such as changing the oxygen content of the water are included, but are not manageable as they are not quantified, nor are other factors included such as pH. It also only introduces a competitive environment, (the game encourages you to release the creatures according to their trophic level) with little emphasis on symbiotic relationships, although if carefully played a notion of commensualism does arise but is not as integral to gameplay as it could have been.It's a fun little simulator but won't hold attention for extended play.

												Welcome to the single most peaceful and enlightened ecosystem ever to grace the planet Earth.  Nothing appears to eat anything else in this ecosystem...even the pike are rather placid.  Otters can gaily swim by them without a fear in the world, all to the tune of some incredibly soothing music.     I propose this ""game"" becomes nothing less than a model for how we can bring about world peace, so that we humans can live in harmony with not only all of nature, but indeed each other.  At least until some♥♥♥♥♥♥disagrees with some other♥♥♥♥♥♥over the teensiest, tiniest difference in their philosophical points-of-view, at which time we will all of course have to declare war upon each other, again.  Such is life.Verdict: 5/10 (10 out of 10 for encouraging world peace and 0 out of 10 for realism, evening out to 5/10.  The otter was quite cute, though).			"

												I am stating that I recommend this game with a caveats as a lot of people don't seem to get the point.- This is a game in only the loosest sense of the word. It IS actually a game, but it requires a great deal of patience(not only to play, but to understand it), and no score is kept. - This game is NOT about pressing buttons. It's about pressing buttons once, and then not pressing buttons again for as long as possible.- The tutorial is kinda bad in that it really doesn't explain the game at all, it just tells you how to work the controls, not what they mean. The game part of this is about finding balance. (Sure, you could just keep spawning things, but that gets old fast.)- The Oxygen content of the water seems to control the algae growth(dace food) and how many creatures you can keep in the pond at any one time. Increase the Oxygen, slow the algae growth, but get more critters. - The basic stock are the Dace and the clam. At the lowest Oxygen levels, you can spawn 3 dace and 2 clams and have the pond run seemingly indefinitely without any other input. By adjusting the Oxygen levels and initial spawns, you can see how long the ecosystem lasts as you build it. - If you want something fast paced, this is not your game. - This is a game for after work where you just want to forget the rest of the world exists and do something mind-numbing without the stupidity of Hollywood. It's simple at the beginning, but harder the more complex you make it.			"

												Lookswise, “Among Ripples” reminds me of a prettied-up, ""no consequences"" version of ""Odell Lake"". If you aren't old as the wheel, fire or dirt - like me - Google it real quicklike.But where ""Odell Lake"" had you basically roleplaying a fish and RNG'd the outcome of your decisions on interactions with other lake critters, ""Among Ripples"" is an ultra-spartan point and click with a sort of mild environmental message of ""Stuff affects stuff."" In “Among Ripples” stuff affects stuff a little, and not permanently.TLDR Bottom line: ""Among Ripples"" is pretty and it's mellow. It will likely provide momentary distraction for those who find the idea of a zen nature simulator interesting, but it's free so if that is your thing - Try it. I did. But I cannot currently recommend it as anything more than a slightly interactive screensaver at this time. ---My thoughts after a whopping ~25-30 min of ""Among Ripples"": (And yes, the amount of time is indeed a massive expenditure for this game. Not sure why I did it except that I like nature, zen games and simulator games... and I guess I was hoping for something to happen that never did.)The paper cutout creatures and background are pretty. The backwoodsy music is mellow and somewhat enjoyable, for a brief music loop. It definitely suits the mood of this game. To ""play"" you click on different features in the environment and fish, clams, crawdads, etc. will spawn in specific  very limited numbers. You can further toy with the ecosystem by altering oxygen levels, and adding/not adding ""cleaner"" species (i.e. crawdads + clams). Again, it is ""pretty"" and there is a decent enough subtle environmental message, but...Begin animal nerd rant: There are things that I find weird. So, you can only spawn a certain number of critters of any given species via the clicking method. For example, you may only have one otter *ever* even though one may ponder what happens when Mr. Otter dies without having a mate-- what happens then? (NO MOAR OTTERZ!!1 That's what!! If this were more realistic...) I mean, ""Why you click the reeds by the tree and spawn one new otter, of course!""I get that they are probably saying something like ""only one apex predator"" per x number of fish in this tiny ecosystem. I get that logic and would be fine with that chain of thoughts... if you couldn't then spawn 5-6 huge pike in the same tiny pond, but only 5 little perch and a handful of the other little fish (drawn a blank on their name) from the lakebed. Pike, especially ones bigger than an Otter, are... scary. I wouldn't wanna share a pond with one... This seems like a major - and illogical - predator/prey population imbalance in a game that seems to otherwise strictly limit your ability to throw anything off without ""significant"" (for this game) effort. For example, I can't click-spawn a buhjillion perch. Or tiny fish. Or clams. You know? The closer to the bottom of the pyramid critters where there should naturally be more of them to feed the larger, less populous species? No matter what, from my experience, only 5 Perch at a time can be clicked into the environment. I can, however, get some to spawn naturally via creating the ideal breeding environment for perch and not having too many predators to eat them, and having the pond stay with a reasonable amount of algae, and enough little feeder fish to eat... yadda yadda, but that does take a little time and experimentation. So... 5ish little fishes, 5ish Crawdad, 5ish+ Clams, 5 Perch, 5 HUGE PIKE and only one Otter. God forbid you spawn 2-3 Otters and see how that would affect the ecosystem. I would have been okay with only getting one Otter if I could spawn only an appropriate amount of Pike, and then again a proportional amount of Pike and the other smaller feeder fish. Or even 1 Otter, 5 Pike, but LOTS more little fish able to be spawned off the bat. I don't know how many would be perfect but 10+ (at least) for the tiny fish would feel more realistic. And those little fish often school and cluster in foliage/debris for protection, rather than spread out solo like they seem to in ""Among Ripples"". In my opinion, there are lots of ""if/thens"" which they could have followed that would allow this simulation to stand on more solid, realistic ground. But right now the ducklings are not in a row. I don't know. I guess the logic just doesn't add up for me. If you make an educational nature sim, you need the system to be logical, accurate and consistent. If you don't you are going to irk/boggle/ the people that already get how it should work and you may be misguiding the rest of the folks who don't. End Animal Nerd Rant!Okay, sorry to those who I have completely lost on by my blabbering about animals like I just did. So, ""Among Ripples"" is pretty... I keep saying that. Probably because after 15 minutes of play, that is all I can say. If you keep clicking on the critter spawns you will most likely have the pond stay balanced enough to be mostly healthy. It seems to take significant effort to get things gross like some of the sample images. I.e. Try to overpopulate (or at least heavily populate as best you can and then inexplicably spawn 5 hugongous Pike), don't spawn cleaner species and let the gook grow rapant while things die and rot into goo at the bottom of the algae-blooming pondy cesspit of blap. Enjoy your stripey ""unhealthy"" creatures and the brown, green layers in your pond. But that's it. Little effort = normalish pond ecosystem. Semi-logical effort = sick pond. Semi-logical counter-efforts = pond is normal again pretty quick. There isn't anything eventful which occurs, in either case, no sense of reward - even a sound and a message of ""You have a healthy pond! Good Job!"" or a health-o-meter UI indicator. It's easy enough to seemingly not ruin, ruin or unruin the pond in a flash. Maybe that is the message they are looking to send, but what they have offered here is basically 15 minutes of ""pretty, clickmash, slight ponder + logical clicking and review of the mild results"". After that there is very little reason to ""play"" this game. And I do enjoy my zen puzzles and simulator games. But ""Among Ripples"" is more ""'Paper Graphics Revamp Odell Lake Screensaver' - Now with clicking things!"". So, it is probable that I played this game longer than many would, at two bursts of ~10-15 minutes trying to see if anything INTERESTING could happen. (It doesn't) And the mellowness just isn't rewarding enough for it to hold interest. Maybe if I got a lobotomy? Anyway. My intention is not to be mean. Just realistic and apparently, long-winded. I spent more time on this review than in the game. If you got this far then maybe you can get through this free game, too!To the developers I would suggest:-More logical starter ecosystem (as described in nerdy rant)-Add ***anything*** to make the simulation more immersive/realistic, providing a point to carry on clicking for more than a fraction of an hour, rather than to leave people thinking “Well, it was free... and, uh, pretty. Yea, pretty.”i.e. Add more events/sub-events, more species, bigger environment, more environments, more actual choices and subsequent consequences. Environmental disasters - oil spills, toxic dumps, invasive exotic species, climate change, mob dumps bodies in pond... uh...i.e. ALIEN TACOS FROM SPACE CANNIBALIZE AND FISH TACOIFY ENTIRE POND POPULATIONS WHILE INADVERTENTLY SECRETING FOREIGN TOXIN THAT STARTS A WAVE OF ZOMBIE FISHES WHICH UPRISE AGAINST HUMANITY AND ANKLE BITE INFECTICATE US TO DEATHINATION!!!!1 Yea, like, anything. I dunno. I am sleepy now, and already regretting that I'm about to click ""Post review"" when I know I have been tiredly ranting for like 30 minutes... oh, god. -_--Best of luck to devs, and fellow gamers!

												5.4/10 - Tranquil; Interactive Screen SaverI do like this game; It's one of those that you can flip on before bed to chill out or leave it running while your doing other things. There isn't much going on other than your mini ecosystem, you can repopulae the area as you see fit and change the oxidation leveles to make some creatures live longer than others.Overall, this is a cool passive game/screen saver. It's not fun enough to be actively playing for long periods of time, but your creatures won't live long enough to keep it in the background, Free so check it out before bed.

												While this game does have nice graphics and music, it does a poor job of simulating an ecosystem.If one is looking to create a vibrant lake full of fish, then one will have to continually exert control by spawning new members of a species when that species goes extinct in the lake.Clams die off far too quickly and even quicker in the presence of crayfish and otters. Also they have some special reproductive requirements such as needing at least 3 or 4 before new clams are born.The best one can probably do is a ecosystem with dace fish and clams. Anything more complex than that requires intervention.I hope the next time a game sells itself as an ecosystem simulation, it the populations within the simulations can reach a state of oscillating equilibrium.

												So, Among Ripples is a game. It's a game where you can try to start up a small ecosystem in a pond.Sounds easy, right?Nah. Not at all. It's actually REALLY ♥♥♥♥ing hard to do, in my opinion.Is there any end game content?Um. No. If you're looking for a GAME game, then you should definitely look elsewhere.Is this a time-waster or time-burning?Oh yes, definitely.It's a super small filesize, and it takes just a few moments to download. It gives you a brief little tutorial about what the premise is, what each little section does, and how to play. It's pretty simple, but more complex than, say, Viridi.Do I recommend it to anyone? Only those that want to dabble in some mindless time-burning, trying to figure out how to make the ecosystem last for more than 5 minutes.Can you do it? "

												As a free to play meditation sort of game, I can't really muster much to say about Among Ripples. The art is rather pleasant and the gameplay smooth. It takes a short time to have a fully populated pond but once that happens and you just 'let it go' the play just rewinds. There's not enough variety or dynamism here to make it truly relaxing or meditative. But it has the potential to be a great learning tool about ecosystems (if there's updates or espansion or DLC) and that's why I think this is perhaps best for very young children.			"

It personally makes me feel kind of sad in a way (gonna get a little hippy on you) because it reminds me of how crappily we treat the environment with pollution and climate change. But overall, I do feel a little better after playing it. Don't expect it to be addicting or intense but more of an experience if that makes sense.			"

												This game is a complete masterpiece. -Pro's. Everything because this game is pure gold. The AI is genius. Great community. The art syle is nothing short of astounding. Endless fun for the family. The campaign is gripping and suspenseful, with a plot that will blow your socks to kingdom come. The online multiplayer is fair, but challenging, Lots of proggression rewards that actually mean something.. No micro-transactions, and thats the truth.. Endless free DLC such as ""fish"".. Hours of bountiful gameplay, and so much more. Impressive graphics, I had to upgrade to run it smoother. The choice is yours; you can allow your ecosystem to thrive, or you could bring pestilence to your land.Cons. I wont be alive long enough to experience the entirety of this beautiful game. Theres not enough cons to fill this section up I have to really think for this part. There are some ping issues with creating a private server but that is only because I am not worthy to have a better one.

												This was a very interesting experiment in minimalism. However, it's because it is so minimalistic that Among Ripples keeps me from actually classifying it as a game. Where many games may use overly simplified graphics, art styles or gameplay mechanics in their presentation to further exemplify the underlying themes which they represent, this project focused much more on simplistic presentation for the sake of player relaxation. Simply put, Among Ripples, if it truly were a game, would be seen as an ecosystem simulator. You'll spend your time inside the game world controlling what spawns in an enclosed lake and seeing how the creatures and circumstances spawned will interact with and effect one another. It's from this choice of ""gameplay"" that my views on this not-a-game spawn. Beyond the very limited interaction you have with the environment, the main drawing point of this game is to wait and watch the reactions of your initial player input. In short, this is not a game because it lacks any true form of gameplay. However, what this project IS is a wonderful little way to help unwind after a stressful day. Because the only input you really have to make as the player is the initial spawning of creatures and setting of the oxygen levels in the lake, your free to observe and intervene with the happenings of the environment at your own pace. While you could actively spawn new creatures as older ones die, you are just as welcome to sit back and let the environment take care of itself, letting species spawn on their own with time and letting them interact in the same fashions they would otherwise. You may even prefer the latter, as the simplistic visuals and the calming, serene background music are a powerfully sedative combination to the stressed mind. Despite it's lack of interface with the player and it's simplistic art style, Among Ripples does actually hold an impressive amount of detail. While you control what goes on in the water, the beautifully painted forest beyond the lake changes as time passes, slowly growing orange and red and tan as summer and fall approach, building up snow bit by bit as winter falls, and having it gradually melt away as spring re-emerges. Additionally, certain combinations of circumstances can cause oddly beautiful outcomes. Leaving your lake with no mollusks to clean up pollution and algae build-up or adding too many crayfish to feed on them can result in the bottom of your lake building up with waste. Depending on the oxygen level and number of certain species in the ecosystem, this waste can have an effect on the fish that get near, spreading diseases and making them change color to sickly yellows or deep, harsh blues. This was easily the most interesting aspect of Among the Ripples for me, but in the end, as interesting as it was, I just couldn't justify it as a game. It lacks too much in intractability and there truly is no end goal to strive for. So, yes, this is not a game. In fact, you could just as easily see it as an intractable screen saver. However, it shouldn't be overlooked so easily because of that. While I can't recommend it as a fun or inspiring title to add to your expanding game libraries, I can happily vouch for this free download simply as an interesting way to help unwind after stressful periods or situations in other games. If you need a calming palate cleanser after a brutal play session in Dark Souls, Battletoads or The Impossible Game, I highly recommend you give this a try.			"

Other than that the game has nice balance such as Crayfish eat clams   Otters Eat Pike   And I adore game that have a cause an effect type and his is that type of game8/10!!!!!!!!!			"

												Among Ripples is actually pretty cute; the visuals and music and sound design are all very relaxing and have a sort of happy vibe to them, which is what the developers were trying to portray with this game, I'm sure. Sadly, I feel like this game just isn't fully living up to it's potential. It would be awesome if it was an idle game that played while you didn't, so there could be some passive development to the lake that you oversee. Also, Steam Achievements and Trading Cards are an absolute must to a game like this- some people just aren't enticed to games of this caliber without them. Lastly, more species of fish and more creatures to spawn would obviously be fun, as well as possibly being able to oversee larger bodies of water as you progress, which would in turn unlock more and more fish and various underwater creatures to spawn and observe. They could also implement different kinds of modes with differing objectives. Anyways, I could go on and on about this game. It has a huge amount of potential and I really hope the developers get around to reading this review and possibly taking my opinion to heart. All in all, this game is worth experiencing, but the actual amount of time you'll play it before realizing it doesn't have a ton of content to offer is probably less than an hour. Truly a cool game though. I hope to see it grow in the feature. <3			"

												This game would be better if it told you what animals did what. You basically have to assume what everyone does. I think it has potential. Like they could turn it into an educational game for kids. If they took the time to add in all of the information it's lacking.I played it thinking I might feel relaxed after, instead it just made me frustrated with the lack in information. So it just made me really irritated. I do not recommend this game for anyone who likes to learn in games like this,or anyone who gets irritated when they don’t know what they are doing.  "

												Ever wanted to create and manage the eco system of a small woodland pond and its little pondy inhabitants? No, of course you haven't, no-one has. But this at least gives you the option to do just that in some small way should the mood ever take you.Among Ripples is a single screen fixed on a tiny tranquil body of water where you'll tap on various points of interest dotted along its surface to spawn fish, clams and otters then sit back and watch them swim about. When the creatures die or get eaten, tap on them again to spawn more and watch the seasons change over the course of a few minutes... that's it. That's pretty much the game in its entirety. It really feels like little more than a glorified, interactive screen saver, and unless I somehow missed some major elements of it, there's no objectives, no end game, and very little in the way of actual gameplay or interaction. But, you know what? I still kinda enjoyed it.It looks pleasant enough and has a nice calming effect, though that's mainly down to the excellent music which I could've happily let play endlessly in the background. So while there might be little to really recommend about this if I was being absolutely honest, at the same time there's pretty much nothing to complain about either, it's nice to experience for a little while, and it's free, so no-one's losing out. Oh, I nearly forgot, if you neglect it you get to see the pond gradually fill up with fish p**... so that's pretty cool.			"

												This ""game"" is hardly a game at all. It's an interactive wallpaper that people find relaxing. Literally all you can do is click 6 different spots on the screen to add another animal, or stop clicking something to let the pond get messed up. The game is literally less intresting than staring at an actual pond. It's the kind of thing you would download, play for 10 minutes to see what it's about, then never play again because of how boring it is. With an actual pond you can feel the water and breeze, you can watch the creatures interact, and play their role in their little ecosystem. With this game you can click 6 spots on the screen, see a creature pop out of nowhere, and watch as it swims around, making the pond magically healthy again.I would really not recommend this game even though it's completely free, simply because of how boring it is to play.

												First off, don't approach this as a full-priced 100% complete game, but rather a tech demo and/or prototype.You know how some of us (including me) have been kinda thumbing our noses at games that tried to be ""artsy"" and intentionally having zero gameplay to make some sort of point?This game is an ""artsy"" game done right.  It actually looks like it has some potential to get those of us who want a modicum of gameplay in these types of games interested where at the same time being accessible to those who just want to kick back and chill.You click different areas of the pond to spawn various sea life and even an otter.  Drag left/right to manipulate the amount of oxygen in the pond.  Animals grow bigger by feeding off of various things in the pond... and that's pretty much it.  Other than that they just swim around in the pond.There's no ""win"" condition or ""endgame"".  Probably will keep your interest for a few minutes.  However, I see a lot of potential for this to be turned into a full blown game.  Anyone remember El Fish from the 90s by Maxis?  I get those vibes from this game.  There's already a small bit of gameplay in it - you need to spawn clams to keep the pond clean, and the various fish you spawn can only survive depending on the amount of oxygen that's in the pond.  You have to balance this out to keep all the fish alive, else those fish die.  If those fish die, you need to use the crayfish you spawn to ""clean up"" the bottom of the pond.Has only one musical piece, but the art style reminds me of some other indie games I played - can't put my finger on it, but it's very easy on the eyes.  I hope they build upon this, interesting concept.			"

												The life of an otter. So peacful, yet, filled with such wonder. People pontificate the very meaning of otter. This is a mere glisp into such a delightful, wonderess, and majestic life. What is otter? How does one fathom the life of such a gentle beast? Such woe and misery in such a reclusive pond. As it Ripples across the very fabric of time. Yet, the otter endures. Yes, I believe that is the very essence, nay, the very soul of the otter. Beauty, charm, elegance, passion, devotion.... Otter. ~ fin ~			"

												A beautiful game. This is one of those games where you don't stress out much over what you have or what an opponent has. It's a game where you just let things happen. The game pulls you in not with action, but with relaxation and the ability to create an entire ecosystem. The music is great, and it plus the art style pull the game together into its 'meditative' style. However, it's not a game for everyone. Many people will get bored of it quickly and uninstall. I, however, won't. It's a great way to make something beautiful and pass the time.			"

I particularly like the way the management was simulated and also the meditative ecosystem. They could improve on the meditative management and the ecosystem simulation. However give me more time to update the review, as I get more invested in the simulation my management skills should increase bettering the ecosystem, whilst enjoying the meditative aspect to this meditative ecosystem management simulator.10/10 Would definitely meditative ecosystem management simulator again.

												Fun little game for about 10 minutes, then you've exhausted everything there is to do.  Would be great if it was a little more complex.Reminds me of elementary school days playing Odell Lake (which is superior to this).			"

												I really..... REALLY wanted to enjoy this game.  The visuals are pretty and soothing, the description sounded right up my alley, and the premise of the game was interesting.Then I tried to play it...  The tutorial did not work at all for me, even after deleting and redownloading the game.  Couldn't find much that was helpful on the forums in terms of explanations.  Decided, what the heck, I'll wing it.  After sitting there for at least twenty minutes, clicking things and trying to figure out what things made what other things happen, I kind of had things figured out.  But... there wasn't really a point.  With no guide and fumbling around to figure out the gameplay mechanics, it just felt like pointless clicking.  So I deleted it.  Hopefully, others will have a more positive experience than I did.			"

												A simple ecosystem simulator.'Among Ripples' is relatively simple game whereby you manipulate the environment in a pond. You can create creatures by clicking on specific items to spawn them. The creatures themselves, move around in the pond and some of them eat smaller creatures. There is a limit of creatures that can be spawned in the pond and you can spawn more when they die. Furthermore, more you can control the level of oxygen in the pond which may cause some creatures to die and others the thrive and vice versa. You basically watch how the creatures react to the environment.The music is soft and suits the game well. There is only one level and only a limited type of creatures available so this game may get boring afterawhile. However, the game is free though and you should try it out for a few minutes of entertainment. "

												Music was lovely, and interesting game mechanics; loved the way the seasons change. I probably haven't played it nearly enough to make a full review, but the game delivered what it said it was (honesty is best policy!). One question for anyone who has had this running longer than me - is there a way to make the pond fully stable on its own without having to add new creatures? it seems like the largest fish never reproduces naturally.

												When it comes to meditative ecosystem management simulators there's only one thing I have to say...there's a lack of meditative ecosystem managemet simulators. I particularly like the way the management was simulated and also the meditative ecosystem. They could improve on the meditative management and the ecosystem simulation. However give me more time to update the review, as I get more invested in the simulation my management skills should increase bettering the ecosystem, whilst enjoying the meditative aspect to this meditative ecosystem management simulator.10/10 Would definitely meditative ecosystem management simulator again.

												This is a wonderful, relaxing game. I found that the seaons and breeding cylces were a nice surprise, and after a bit of experimentation I managed to get a self-maintaining system. The art style was nice and the seasonal changes subtle, but if you're paying attention they're there. I didn't like the otter though, it remained submerged constantly until the spring rolled around. It did everything as advertised and the best part is: its totally free.			"

												A fun little game that has some relaxing music, a fitting art style and no real goal or purpose as the small pond ecosystem never really leaves its status quo; it can neither flourish nor be completely devestated by your hand.

												No, its not action. No its not puzzle. No it doesn't have a story. No it doesn't have an endgame. Yes its entertaining to play with for a few minutes.I felt compelled to write a review after reading all of the negative ones on the store page. They tell you up front exactly what this game is, they tell you how it came to be, and they tell you the purpose behind it. I wouldn't suggest that anyone play this game if they want a game to play for hours and become immersed in. This is more a learning tool than a game, and with some further polish I could see it becoming a great addition to classrooms to assist teachers in explaining ecosystems and nature. I do suggest that you download it, its only a couple megabytes, and play around with it for ten minutes, then uninstall it if you don't feel you'll ever open it again. Best of luck to the Dev(s).

												Obviously a very simple project by someone with extremely limited resources. That being said - limitations really do breed some seriously creative thinking. I quite enjoy the simplicity. It's refreshing to see a game revolving around life instead of murder and destruction. Very relaxing atmosphere. Surprisingly engaging. Would like to see 3D models and a larger array of options in the future. :)			"

I'm not the best at making reviews but, I'll try my best.So, this game can be pretty sad.. it shows the life cycle of fish, otters, etc.   There are many possibiltys for this game.So in the end, if you enjoy calm, relaxing games.. get this one, if you love life cycles, get it.  I rate it a 9/10.  Thank you developers for making this, and may you continue to make new games like this.			"

												This game, for all its simplicity, is fantastic. It's not the kind of game where you rack up lots of gameplay but it's surprisingly soothing and enjoyable.You are supposed to model the ecosystem of a small pond. Easy, right? Here's where you put some of your high school biology knowledge to work. There are clams, crayfish, an otter and three types of fish, ranging from very small to very big. You have to keep adding more creatures from the different spawn points in the pond in order to help find the right balance of critters. The pond gets dirty and the fish will die and you have to keep a mental count of the amount of critters in the pond so that they dont all eat each other at once.  I recommend that you use the tutorial first so that you know where everything is, but jumping right into the game is fun too. Try to keep more smaller animals than larger animals and mimic actual ecosystems for the most success.  It's not an extremely challenging game if you know what you're doing, and I'm sure it gets boring if you play it for too long. But the backgrounds are gorgeous and the mechanics work smoothly. What more do you want from a free game?Pros:-Great art-Smart concept-Not too difficult-Good musicCons:-May bore the truly frenetic among us			"

Originally posted at http://www.apochs.netAmong Ripples is the product of a student project from a two-man team that went on to form Eat Create Sleep Studios. The title, an aquatic simulator of sorts, has been receiving plenty of praise since it was first made available to download for free on-line through Google Play, Desura, and most recently Steam. But, with such an immense opportunity for the duo's debut, does this outing hold your attention, or is it an underwhelming experience?Among Ripples is a basic wildlife simulator. The ecosystem in this small pond once was able to take care of itself, but now isn't able to. The only way for life to return is with your help. You control the amount of creatures in it, including fish, crawdads, and even an otter. You can't go overboard initially though, as you are limited in having no more than five newborn species at a time. Once full grown or die off, you can throw more into the mix. You can also control the amount of air in the pond to help increase or decrease the levels of algae and other toxins within the water.And that becomes the problem right there. It's a cute idea at first, but the game has a few too many restrictions at play. There's only five aquatic types you can spawn, and an otter. Other than the air variable and uncontrollable changes in the season that can impact the ecosystem, there's nothing else to really work with. Unless you enjoy playing god over this small amount of underwater life, the novelty can wear relatively thin with what is present. Thankfully the developers do take what the community has to say into consideration, as shown by the recent update they implemented.At the time of writing this, there has been an update that allows the game to run in the background, much like the recent successful application Mountain can. However, with how fast the life typically matures, dies, or is eaten, there's very little reason to leave this program running if you are putting an effort into maintaining the environment while multi-tasking. In fact, in the time it took me to write that sentence, all but one of the fish I had in the pond died. And in writing that sentence, only two of the new ones I just hatched, along with the five clams I spawned, remain alive.Another thing I noticed is that, while the point of Among Ripples is that the pond's ecosystem can't thrive without your help, isn't necessarily true. After stepping away and letting all life die while preparing and eating dinner, I came back to find that the last remaining fish that survived was now joined by three others. Once in a while, a random fish will disappear entirely towards the bottom of the screen, but eventually, without my interference, another one or two of that species would spawn automatically. The pond hasn't exactly thrive with new life, but it can still operate on its own, but does make you interested in leaving the application running over night to see what happened while you were asleep.That said, the last thing going for Among Ripples, other than the nice hand painted visuals, ends up being the soundtrack. The ads (on Steam at least) claim it has an ambient score that changes with the seasons. After an hour of playing around with the pond and just letting it run in the background, the same loop of sombre folk music has not changed, regardless of the season I am currently facing other than getting a little louder, which is just the general progression of the music itself and not based on any other factor. As far as the ambience goes, there's very little that ends up altered other than some chirping birds in the spring and summer.In the end, Among Ripples doesn't quite live up to what it could have been, but for a student project this literal fish bowl in a pond stands as a good debut for Eat Create Sleep Studios. There are plenty of opportunities to include more species, have region-based creatures, or other detrimental and beneficial factors from the surroundings other than imminent death. Having a more realistic life span for the animals would be a nice touch as well, and not a death rate that is essentially three to four minutes in ninety percent of the spawned creatures. The good news is that the developers are listening to the community, and hopefully there will be more updates in the future, such as the most recent that included the background application function. If more is added down the line, there's no doubt it'll be a more engaging simulator. For now, it's enjoyable for what it is, and a good way to unwind after a stressful day.			"

Originally posted at http://www.apochs.netAmong Ripples is the product of a student project from a two-man team that went on to form Eat Create Sleep Studios. The title, an aquatic simulator of sorts, has been receiving plenty of praise since it was first made available to download for free on-line through Google Play, Desura, and most recently Steam. But, with such an immense opportunity for the duo's debut, does this outing hold your attention, or is it an underwhelming experience?Among Ripples is a basic wildlife simulator. The ecosystem in this small pond once was able to take care of itself, but now isn't able to. The only way for life to return is with your help. You control the amount of creatures in it, including fish, crawdads, and even an otter. You can't go overboard initially though, as you are limited in having no more than five newborn species at a time. Once full grown or die off, you can throw more into the mix. You can also control the amount of air in the pond to help increase or decrease the levels of algae and other toxins within the water.And that becomes the problem right there. It's a cute idea at first, but the game has a few too many restrictions at play. There's only five aquatic types you can spawn, and an otter. Other than the air variable and uncontrollable changes in the season that can impact the ecosystem, there's nothing else to really work with. Unless you enjoy playing god over this small amount of underwater life, the novelty can wear relatively thin with what is present. Thankfully the developers do take what the community has to say into consideration, as shown by the recent update they implemented.At the time of writing this, there has been an update that allows the game to run in the background, much like the recent successful application Mountain can. However, with how fast the life typically matures, dies, or is eaten, there's very little reason to leave this program running if you are putting an effort into maintaining the environment while multi-tasking. In fact, in the time it took me to write that sentence, all but one of the fish I had in the pond died. And in writing that sentence, only two of the new ones I just hatched, along with the five clams I spawned, remain alive.Another thing I noticed is that, while the point of Among Ripples is that the pond's ecosystem can't thrive without your help, isn't necessarily true. After stepping away and letting all life die while preparing and eating dinner, I came back to find that the last remaining fish that survived was now joined by three others. Once in a while, a random fish will disappear entirely towards the bottom of the screen, but eventually, without my interference, another one or two of that species would spawn automatically. The pond hasn't exactly thrive with new life, but it can still operate on its own, but does make you interested in leaving the application running over night to see what happened while you were asleep.That said, the last thing going for Among Ripples, other than the nice hand painted visuals, ends up being the soundtrack. The ads (on Steam at least) claim it has an ambient score that changes with the seasons. After an hour of playing around with the pond and just letting it run in the background, the same loop of sombre folk music has not changed, regardless of the season I am currently facing other than getting a little louder, which is just the general progression of the music itself and not based on any other factor. As far as the ambience goes, there's very little that ends up altered other than some chirping birds in the spring and summer.In the end, Among Ripples doesn't quite live up to what it could have been, but for a student project this literal fish bowl in a pond stands as a good debut for Eat Create Sleep Studios. There are plenty of opportunities to include more species, have region-based creatures, or other detrimental and beneficial factors from the surroundings other than imminent death. Having a more realistic life span for the animals would be a nice touch as well, and not a death rate that is essentially three to four minutes in ninety percent of the spawned creatures. The good news is that the developers are listening to the community, and hopefully there will be more updates in the future, such as the most recent that included the background application function. If more is added down the line, there's no doubt it'll be a more engaging simulator. For now, it's enjoyable for what it is, and a good way to unwind after a stressful day.			"

												Among Ripples is, for what it is, a good game. It's only about 10-20 minutes of entertainment, but it's free, so who can complain? Basically, you click various ""nests"" on the screen to spawn different species of fish and bottom feeders to try to balance the pond ecosystem. You will likely fail repeatedly, either watching your fish eat all of another species or your pond fill with pollution and grime. It is not a game to be won, however, and it's more about the zen of watching your creatures through their life cycle. If you'd like to see some gameplay, you can see my review here:

												I'm sorry for downvoting this, but this is in my opinion a waste of time. First off, it doesn't give you a goal. I can forgive that seeing as the player is probably aware that a game that advertises itself as simulation might not have that. But the interface is horrible. I do not know what's supposed to be a polluted or healthy lake, I don't know whether my fish are doing well or not. I need feedback from the game to know what is going on, otherwise i'm just clicking buttons with no idea whether it's working or not.Free to play is about the only positive thing I have to say about this.

												I don't like to give bad reviews to completely free titles and I suspect that many others don't either, which might explain this game's Mostly Positive status given that it offers a shocking level of suck.I have to believe that those reviewers who call this an intriguing idea have never played a virtual aquarium/ecosystem before. Well, I have. Many with more aesthetic appeal and things to do, some over a decade ago.But again, it's free, so go ahead and check it out if you want. In fact, you probably should check it out if you have considered purchasing the developers other title, Crest. I thought that looked interesting but less so now that I've played this uninspired waste of time.			"

												With some basic updates, like a save feature and a better menu with an option to continue playing, instead of starting over again... I think this could be an Ok game. I think more detail would have been nice but its smooth. Well done and thought out. I think more play testing before release would have been better. To handle the balance and UI issues.However, I really like this simulation. Its not a game you understand, there are no goals. You simply click objects to inject them into the simulation. There are some soft caps, based on time, stopping you from just flooding the simulation with new objects. Other then that its up to you. I have not been able to produce more then 30 Small fish, and can not seem to get a full working ecosystem. Its an intresting precep and a fully working game with full 3-D enviorment and objects is something I might actually buy for 20-30 bucks, if it was well play tested and balanced. Now I am thinking about Norns... ah the countless hours messing with that just to realize I would never teach them to sustain themselves. AI PEOPLE!! FOCUS ON AI!!Overall for the price this is definetly a game worth playing. From now on when you read any reviews look at the time played. If someone that a game was soo friggin awesome, then why have they only played 0.6 hours?			"

												This has to be the most intense game i have ever played. I look forward to beating it but it is so hard it is insane! This action packed first person horrer based simulater game is unlike anything ever seen on the web. Oh if only there was a game like it but better! Like, just about anything. I am bored now. Its a game ok? it too simple for complex thinking.			"

												I have to say i was skeptical when i first installed this game but it has exceeded my expectations and now it is one of my favorite games i have ever played. I have played lass than 10 minutes and my lobster are already 700 years huge and im making them bigger. Everyone has t download this game immediately. I especially like this game while doing my homework . It is a  masterpiece because it captures Nature's peacefulness in one single videogame, which i might add it only takes 10 seconds to download. 10/10 would download 1000X again.			"

												""Oh look my baby has done a poo poo, i'm so proud that he/she has learnt how to do poo poo's. I know let's take a snapshot and share it viral so that everyone can spend hrs looking at my baby's poo poo's"" While the above statement might sound WEIRD, it aptly describes the game 'Among Ripples'. The dev's with their baby programming skills have just learnt how to do poo poo's and they are really, really, I can't express this enough, really proud of their babies poo poo's.The game/interactive screen saver/preganant gif claims to be relaxing and peaceful. How can it be relaxing when you have to eternally click everything, to prevent your pond becoming stagnant because everything here has the lifespan of a misquito born on a bug zapper?  Granted the music is peaceful, but maybe in suite of the clickfest needed this music would have been more relative...

			Apparently this is an interactive screensaver to people, but a very fun game for pets! My dog practically ran over all my equipment to attack my screen!		

 Within a minute you'll soon realise that everything here is vanity and give up in clicking, watching all your hard work slowly disolve into nothingness. Life is but a short whim. You'll soon feel depressive and wish for a shotgun. Thanks devs. The music will then begin to serve a palative care role before the wake (logging off).The game is deisgned by Eat, create, sleep but more fundamentally 2 students doing work experience. I'm not sure what they are actually proud of here? The game serves no purpose whatsoever and does not showcase an outstanding example what they can do or create. Here the fish look like they have been pencilled in by crayon at a preschool. The pike for instance looks like a vommit patch of flapping seaweed. So why show it? Granted there is a lack luster of fish simulators on Steam and credit to them that they are at least smart enough to see a need for a niche in this potential market, but in comparison to the other fish simulators this is awful. If you want to look at some interesting fish simulators with peaceful music take a look at. https://apps.facebook.com/aquantika_a/  a facebook game or if your looking for something for an ipad maybe this one... http://www.fishgame3d.com/If you love this game and are eternally thrilled by it congratulations you have the intelligence of a dumb mutt, but least the mutt is cute and I hope for your sake in life that same principle applies to you too...

												This is the only true and honest review about this game so go ahead and read this one and ignore the other ones it's ok I'm a friend of your parents, trust me.also: read this entire review.. before judging! Don't be shoo'd away after the first few lines.So, this game is actually really good and really fun, next to this it's also very educative, that is if you like watching rotting corpses in a morgue.There was one line that came to mind when I started to play which was: "" black cross, black cross "" .Why you ask? Because that's how this game should be treated, avoid it like the plague infested nests.Burn it to the ground since this gets humanity nowhere.If you have ANY tollerance for gaming throughout the 20-30 years that it exists, burn this♥♥♥♥♥♥to the ground and hunt down whoever made it.This is a true abomination of the world.Whoever made this should be kicked in the♥♥♥♥♥♥and then be forced to spend a week with its own feces stuffed in his ♥♥♥♥ing cockhole.Thanks, all in all a decent game.

Hopefully more environmental elements will be added in the future.All in all if you are wanting to kill 20 mins or play a very casual and relaxing god game go for it.Spawned some crawfish which turned into lobster's which later got eaten by carnivorious fish. 8/10-Casey			"

												I put two minutes into the game, including messing with settings and going through the tutorial. By the time those two minutes had passed, I believe I had seen everything this ... software has to offer. There is nothing here. It's trying to be one of those relaxing ""play with the environment"" games, but nothing happens. I'm not exaggerating. Literally nothing happens. There is barely even any interactivity. You may as well just draw a couple fish on a piece of paper and stick it on your monitor, at least that could be entertaining.  P.S: I have five minutes on record because I was required to put that much time in in order to write a review.			"

I did not feel at peace as I clicked five things to create more things that did things, I was not bothered by them doing anything as there was no progression. Uh, why couldnt they add a objective or something as it would boost the game.Well this has taken my attention from better things like: -And it pains to say it is even better than something- Dota 2 which has a objective atleast.Atleast it didnt have micro transactions....

												The animations are choppy. They made better aquarium screen savers back in the 90's. There's alo very little feedback, you just have to guess how to manage the pond. Once I added a pike and an otter, they just kept eating all the fish faster than they could spawn. There's a way to control th oxygen level in the pond but it's not clear what effect it has.It's kind of a neat idea and I wish I could recommended it. With better graphics and animation, and better feedback, it would probably be a pretty cool game. Maybe if it had stages, goals, unlocks, or some kind of evolution type system it would be worth $10-$20 even. Right now it's basically a proof of concept, but I'm not sure what the concept is and the proof leaves me unconvinced.			"

												I downloaded this because I enjoyed playing SimLife years ago and was expecting something similar. However, this game has poor balance and stupid AI. Most of the fish will die quickly apart from the brown ones that look like turds, they'll just sit at the bottom of the pool, unmoving and reproducing. Don't even think about adding one of the otter things to the pond either because they'll act like a holocaust on legs, killing everything else and then dying themselves because they've got nothing left to eat.

Unfortunately after playing some time it becomes a little bit boring beacuse you can't do much and there is no way to get some data about oxygen levels, pH level, water temperature, etc. there are only a few things to do.For smaller kids i think this game would be amazing, because it's simple to play and children could learn about how important the ecosystem is, how bigger animals depend on very small animals and how small changes have big impacts.

												It is hard to describe this game other than it's a meditation game, but a really good one.Among Ripples Review -Detroit0127This game doesn't involve any skill (well, just the oxygen levels) and it doesn't really require any thinking at all. You deploy fish into this pond of yours and you could put a certain amount of fish in there and they swim around and interact with some calm and soothing music playing in the background.I usually write a whole big review for a game, but since it's a short but endless game (depending how you look at it, and the fact that I have legitimately played 9 hours of this game, it is actually endless) I'm going to do a pros and cons list of the game.PROS:-Free to Play (isn't that always great?)-Soothing and Calm Music (great to relax to and just listen if you don't want to play the game)-Variety of fish (you can choose what you want to put in the pond from a good amount of choices)-Seal (you can put a seal in here, he lives the longest)-Fish die... (you actually have to maintain your little pond)-Fair Graphics (doesn't really matter for this game)-Endless Gameplay (play as long as you want)-Weird But Fun (weird little game, involving fish but fun)-Relaxes you (it actually works as a meditation game!)CONS:(VERY LITTLE)-Menu (could add a few things to it, involving an option for fullscreen mode and turn down the music or completely shut it off)-Oxygen (This confused me a little bit, you have to try to get your oxygen just right to keep your fish from dying?)-Crabs (if that's what they are, they deploy things that are supposed to help but actually kill fish instead)NEUTRAL- (NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD)-Achievements (it seems like it doesn't NEED achievements, but it would be fun to have them in there)One of the coolest parts about this game is the fact that it was a school project. Obviously this would be an A+, totally worth picking up and trying! -Detroit0127			"

												Needs an auto mode on it so you don't need to create new animals yourself. Other than that it is a nice peaceful experience. I won't call it a game, a game has a start, an objective, a point to it. This, you just create fish and watch then eat each other. You need to keep the ecosystem in balance with what animals you introduce. It can be challenging to keep the ecosystem in check, which is where the auto mode would come in handy for those who just want to watch.			"

												Game play is extremely simplistic but I found it quite enjoyable and refreshing from the usual. It's a game for when you don't really feel like doing anything but you also want to do somthing. Music is extremely relaxing, would pay for the music available as a separate download if the game stayed free. If they did eventually charge for it they couldn't charge a lot, but for a free game you really have nothing to lose by playing it right?			"

												pond life ecology or ecosystem education its good for E I am not sure what rating said but I enjoyed it, Does help people who don't know smack about fishing get broader aspect what happens what big fish do and what normally if there were River otters and other creatures that play role, I am sure if they had gators or larger bird of prey it would really make it bigger pond but they really have smaller sort of ecology and I sort hoping it would expand. So it would make room for broader ranges like shrimp, and explain away what is what. graphics goodsound no issuewould I recomend you get this for everyone yes, Among the ripples would be good for people who love water and tide pools.

												Looking at the ratings and reviews, I thought to myself, ""Hey! I've finally found a nice, relaxing and engaging game.""I installed it, played the tutorial, ""Ok simple enough- wait... what?""Unfortunately the gameplay is minimal. It's easy to follow, but it's in no way engaging. If anything I got frustrated at the game because you click on a few points on the screen, and just watch it. I suggest watching a movie or reading a book instead if your want to relax.I understand that it's a free game, download and try it by all means. I however, am going to continue to search for a decent relaxation game.			"

The ability to alter the environment is the biggest part of the game while at the moment the best you can do is change the oxygen level, which all in all, is not that impressive. The game has the ability to have clams to change the habitat of the water, but even that is basic and not very effective. The game has nice graphics and music which makes it a pleasant enviromnent. Overall the game is good, my only wish is that it adds more things to do with it, otherwise it's only an hour of playtime max.			"

The pond image is hand drawn, so I had no ability to change the soil or alter the shape of the pond.With a little more input options and maybe some info feedback like the oxygen levels in the pond, this could be a decent little zen game.

												I really love thinking about what Among Ripples could be. I feel that the devs nailed the music and the watercolor graphics (unique and beautiful) but the gameplay could be much better. I feel that the gameplay is not difficult and borderline tedious after more than 20 minutes. I think it would be amazing if this game could be a casual strategy game with a gradual incline of difficulty (larger pond, more fish, and other elements to manage). This would really grasp the element that makes games addictive. Other than that, I think it is a great game and I have to give it a thumbs up.			"

												This game was alright, I expected a bit more by the looks of it. It looks more classified for a classroom or for children to learn somethng off of. It's about building a small ecosystem and how everything works. Once you get in all the little animals in the pond, you end the game. It took me about 15 minutes and the game was completely over. If you're looking for a longer and entertaining game, this wouldn't be for you. Seem's more of a children based game, which isn't a bad idea, but it came off confusing to me.			"

												There is no balance in the game... I spent more than an hour trying to find some form of balance, and it's just not there. The best I can do is maintain some balance by continually spawning more things. The only thing self maintained are the crayfish for the most part. The pirch are the worst since they die all the time and there doesn't seem to be a way to keep them alive. The crayfish are constantly eating the clams instead of the fish corpses, so it's difficult to find that balance on the clams since if you spawn too many, they die of starvation. There is no concept of realism anywhere in the game, and the tutorial doesn't explain enough to understand a lot of it.Also, if that wasn't bad enough, there isn't enough content to keep a person interested for more than an hour.The graphics and controls are ok for what the game is, so no complaints there.It's just not a good game, good thing it was free. But even as a free game, it's hardly worth your time.			"

												Why I chose to play this game? Simple: To create the process of eutrophication in a simple lake such as this one. But due to the lack of complexity of this game to change ph levels and to further change O2 levels, I can partially enhance the growth of algea in the lake to sort of begin the process of eutrophication. Overall I was unpleased, but I can't say I hate this game. It's too casual, and I should have known better. This game does have potential, just needs more added features to it. Look up eutrophication for those who didn't take an Environmental science class in high school, the process is crazy and sadly is commonly found in lakes across America. I sorta recommend this game to the casual players who love otters.The otters are cute and real.RESPECT THE OTTERS			"

												It's a decent game for just relaxing and will probably help those with anxiety to calm down some. Though it does little to hold much attention. It's not incredibly varied, the song loops and became quite annoying. If you need something to focus on to distract away any sort of anxiety or negativity, this is your game. Otherwise it's not much to mess with.			"

												It is a nice relaxing game with a beautifull background and soothing music. Unfortunately after playing some time it becomes a little bit boring beacuse you can't do much and there is no way to get some data about oxygen levels, pH level, water temperature, etc. there are only a few things to do.For smaller kids i think this game would be amazing, because it's simple to play and children could learn about how important the ecosystem is, how bigger animals depend on very small animals and how small changes have big impacts.

												     Among Ripples is a very calming experience. I has great, relaxing music. The art style reminds of the kind of watercolour paintings you would throw together in gradeschool. The animals themselves were very simple and easy to look at. The entire game has little detail, which I think helps with the calming aspect. The only concern I have with it is there seems to be no end goal- no way to properly balance the pond out to make it self sustaining. The problem I got each time was too many pike, who would proceed to devour everything.        If you are looking for an action game or a game with a lot of replayability, this is not it. But if you want to take a moment to relax between sessions of COD or calm yourself after dealing with a troll in LoL, give this game a play.Besides, it's free.			"

												this game is so relaxing and beautiful but after a while it gets a little but repetative and I can't see it entertaining me for more than a few hours. Either way it's definitely worth checking out plus it doesn't cost you a cent. 8/10 easily worth a download			"

												A very, very relaxing game. The soothing instrumental music goes very well with the watercolour look to the game. It's lack in complexity makes it feel like a mobile game but, if you're doing homework, making an aggravating spreadsheet, or a stressful powerpoint, this game is perfect to keep in a small window in the corner of you're screen. Among Ripples is an amazing meditative game and, I would definately recomend it to anyone with a lot of stress in their life.			"

												pond life ecology or ecosystem education its good for E I am not sure what rating said but I enjoyed it, Does help people who don't know smack about fishing get broader aspect what happens what big fish do and what normally if there were River otters and other creatures that play role, I am sure if they had gators or larger bird of prey it would really make it bigger pond but they really have smaller sort of ecology and I sort hoping it would expand. So it would make room for broader ranges like shrimp, and explain away what is what. graphics goodsound no issuewould I recomend you get this for everyone yes, Among the ripples would be good for people who love water and tide pools.

												Game play is extremely simplistic but I found it quite enjoyable and refreshing from the usual. It's a game for when you don't really feel like doing anything but you also want to do somthing. Music is extremely relaxing, would pay for the music available as a separate download if the game stayed free. If they did eventually charge for it they couldn't charge a lot, but for a free game you really have nothing to lose by playing it right?			"

												Visually, the game is nice.I thought that the game would be more like ""throw the fish in the pond and see where they're at tomorrow"", but the creatures need constant attention.There are no ""levels"" of species, nor is there a very diverse ecosystem.It seems like a lot of work went into the game, but I wish that there were more than five minutes of playability.Since it is a free download, I do recommend trying it out.  Maybe you'll find more pleasure in this basic game than I.			"

												It is a nice relaxing game with a beautifull background and soothing music. Unfortunately after playing some time it becomes a little bit boring beacuse you can't do much and there is no way to get some data about oxygen levels, pH level, water temperature, etc. there are only a few things to do.For smaller kids i think this game would be amazing, because it's simple to play and children could learn about how important the ecosystem is, how bigger animals depend on very small animals and how small changes have big impacts.

												Why I chose to play this game? Simple: To create the process of eutrophication in a simple lake such as this one. But due to the lack of complexity of this game to change ph levels and to further change O2 levels, I can partially enhance the growth of algea in the lake to sort of begin the process of eutrophication. Overall I was unpleased, but I can't say I hate this game. It's too casual, and I should have known better. This game does have potential, just needs more added features to it. Look up eutrophication for those who didn't take an Environmental science class in high school, the process is crazy and sadly is commonly found in lakes across America. I sorta recommend this game to the casual players who love otters.The otters are cute and real.RESPECT THE OTTERS			"

												It's a decent game for just relaxing and will probably help those with anxiety to calm down some. Though it does little to hold much attention. It's not incredibly varied, the song loops and became quite annoying. If you need something to focus on to distract away any sort of anxiety or negativity, this is your game. Otherwise it's not much to mess with.			"
