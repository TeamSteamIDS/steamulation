												Don't bother.   2 reasons: 1) Title page instantly targets 'Gamer Gate' people.    If getting a refund for 2 bucks wasnt going to be a hassle, I wouldn't have even progressed into the actual game.    2) To beat the game in less than 5 minutes, all you have to do is be the most beaurocratic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.   Just keep saying no. Bamm.  You win.    Cant be bothered to find out if theres another ending that doesnt result in being fired.			"

												This has all the fun and excitement of listening to two people trying to access an insurance account.  Voice acting was a bore, the graphic quality is slipshod at best and downright horrifying when a poorly animated face appears.  It has half the interactivity of Emily is Away with half the content and a less interesting story.  Not to mention the slant against gamergate at the start.Opinions are fine, but when you place them front and center with a banner that clearly has more effort and detail placed into it than any art in game, it gives off the impression you're either trying to A)Pander to othersorB) be edgy for buys "

												I would not reccomend this game at this time.     I bought this game within days of its release several years ago.  At the time, I was a call center worker, and wanted to support a fellow grunt.  I was moved by the story of a developer who had made a game based on his experiences and was terminated as a result.  I wanted to support the creator in his quest to become a developer.     In itself, this game is a short 5-10 minute window into what red tape feels like.  It illustrates the difficulty of something as simple as an address change, gives you a brief but accurate perspective into a few moments of the life of a call center worker, and may teach people how to not be a difficult caller.       You play the role of a call center rep who receives a call from someone claiming to be a Mr. Swarth.  The caller is somewhat disagreeable, unprepared for the call, and mostly clueless.  Caller requests an address change. If you are able to get through the questions without getting fired, you will conclude that the caller is unable to prove his identitly, and the caller will disconnect.  However, if you anger the caller, or break rules to attempt to appease the caller, you will be terminated..     The reason I do not reccomend this game is not because it is short, or the art style is less than optimal.  That's all fine.  I do, however, fundamentally disagree with the message of the game.  The game's message appears to be: call center jobs are soul-sucking, and it is your job to not help people.  To this effect, the achievement for actually completing the call with the desired outcome is designed as literally impossible to get.  100%ers beware.However, the game's message should be: following the law is a beautiful thing.  While we were unable to help the caller, we actually did a real service to the actual Mr. Swarth; As it is impossible to verify the caller's identitly, Mr. Swarth's information has been protected from potential unwarrented disclosure or tampering.  Also, in real life, I was and am very good at my job, and I believe there is no claimant, customer, or beneficiary who cannot be helped.  As I write this review, I work for Uncle Sam; I do my job with a rigid iron rod lodged firmly up my backside, and I am an extremely effective public servant regardless.     I will not reccomend this game unless and until the developer makes the requisite amendments to the game per the unfulfilled goals stated for the game's future prior to the steam port.			"

												I purchased this game because, working in an call center, I thought it would be a funny take on work life. Unfortunately, playing through to the end of the call was very tedious and there was only one scenario. The game was not funny and really has little replay value. I got fired twice, then I played through. Now I dont really have any reason to play again.			"

												This is a fun little customer support operator sim. You only go through one call, and if you follow the script ""right"" you'll finish the game in under 10 minutes. It is slightly entertaining to also go back and try do it ""wrong"". Nothing earth-shattering, but it does what it says on the box and is a pleasant enough diversion.			"

												Although the game is not perfect, I still like it. It has enjoyable, humourous narative; Especially if you are willing to put the time in to find the real gems that make this game great.I do wish the credits were skippable, as they get annoying after sitting though them multiple times when you want to play the game multiple times and I wish the picture of Billy remained the static picture in the pre-steam release. The animated picture looks kind of weird. Apart from these things, this game it totally worth it for £1.59.			"

												There are definitely pros and cons to this one; personally I can't help but recommend it for its quality and message, but I was disappointed at how short of an experience it is, and how simple it is to work through.  Getting all of the achievements will be a bit of a slog, maybe impossible, but it is entertaining enough to come back to after a break.Essentially, you are a customer service representative dealing with a difficult customer on the telephone.  Unfortunately the title of this game is literal; there is only one customer and the call never changes.  It's possible to interpret this as part of the game's message, but for a piece of software that costs money, there really should be more content.  Be prepared to 'finish' in less than ten minutes, and whilst it is perfectly understandable if that represents bad value to you, I'm personally glad I played it.  I'm sure there will be sale prices that are more justifiable, so maybe wait for that or get it in a bundle.The voice acting is great, as it really should be in a piece which is primarily audio based.  The developer has opted for an (I think intentionally) janky MS-paint visual style, which is humorous and adequate since there is really nothing to look at in a desk job like this anyway.  And that is the point; to convey the horrible banality of such work, being treated badly by customers as a matter of course as if the guidelines you follow are your fault when you've come to despise them as much as they do; anyone who has worked in customer services, tech support or telesales will find this resonates uncomfortably with their everyday experience.  Perhaps the work presented to us if we want to get those achievements is a reflection of that.(Also, it is nice to see a game start with an anti-GamerGate message.  It's old news by now, sure, but people are still sore from that experience and it is nice to see devs acknowledging that within their games.  Obviously this can't be a factor in a review of the game itself, but kudos for the bravery).			"

												Is this a great game? (Or a game at all?) Not really. I think this was obviously highlighting a very specific issue and while it was an interesting purchase, I don't think I could recommend it. I bought it because I had heard the news surrounding the development. There isn't much gameplay and though I have spent around two hours playing through the same bloody call, there isn't enough variation, and therefore Billy, you will never  be able to change your address. You or the player will be stuck in an endless loop. The moral of the story? Learn to remember important stuff.			"

												This was a game released a long time ago through the developers website, and he actually ended up getting fired from his job when his employer found out. I remember there being a story on PC gamer about this game and that's how I found out about it. Anyway, the developer made it overly difficult to translate your original purchase into a Steam key, and so I feel like he's kind of shady for that, but in total I paid maybe 4 dollars for 2 keys for this game so whatever, What was I going to buy? One gallon of gas?IGTCED should strike home for anyone who's worked in any support position at all, whether it was a call center or where you are a top tier remote desktop support person, SCCM technician, or anything else where you have to talk to a person who is inevitably stupid. It's hard to explain if you've never been subjected to this, because even the most loquacious person is just going to tell you ""end-users/customers/lusers are ♥♥♥♥ing idiots."" This can at least illustrate some of the stupidity they put up with.I wouldn't really call it a game, but if visual novels are games, so is this.			"

												I am a Technical Support Specialist.  I usually do my work onsite, but I still feel some kinship to the fellow in this game.  I come face to face with people every day who have insurmountable problems that have severely impacted their ability to run their business.  I can usually resolve these issues with a simple Google search.  Sure, sometimes I run into real problems where I have to call on some dedicated hardware support, or developers whose software has so many dependencies it could be considered a welfare state, but what I specialize in, and the calls I am given most often, are “user error” issues.To be honest, this is low level support.  I don't know the APIs, I haven't memorized the circuit diagrams.  I just fix stupid.  I'm ok with that.  Sure, I wish I made as much money as those other guys, but I don't know the things they do.  I do know stupid though.  I also know how to fix stupid.  Google.Heck, I have Google open right now as I write this.  Think I know how to spell dependencies?  Please.  This is 2016.  Intelligence is dead, and my customers are living proof.  Here's an example.  I had a customer call in and say that their email scanning stopped working for everyone.  Well, the first reason that would happen is a password change.  So, as always, I ask.  Did the password change?  She said no.  So I go onsite to see what may have happened, and when I get there the lady is standing in front of the copier CHANGING THE PASSWORD!Stupidity and lies.  That is what support deals with every single day.  That is what this game is about.  I approve of that.			"

												In it's own way I can say that it is a good game.The tediness and the possible ways of doing things is what this game offers. However. Is it worth 2 dollars? Maybe but personally I would have made this free. Not because it's not good but It just doesn't have as much content as I was expecting. While I don't have an issue with short games this just seems to be too simple if that makes sense. Despite me saying that I do recommend this game because I don't think it's great but at the same time it's not bad. But really if it had more content like different annoying calls and such. Not that I don't think you shouldn't get paid for this I'm just explaining that it could be free and nudge nudge if you want more content like this you could come out with a game similar to this and have more content including this. Just how I would go about it. But it is a decent game and so I would get annoyed again. 7/10			"

												After your initial playthrough, you can try again and pick other options, but why would you want to?  The best part about this game is that I have no doubt that working in customer service is this mind numbingly awful and the game portrays being mind numbingly awful very well.  So in that respect, it works.  I would advise getting this game for anyone who thinks they should skip school, get poor grades and then work in a call center.  For anyone who's looking for a fun game to play, though, I'd look elsewhere.			"
