												The game you get when your spouse doesn't let you get an actual tractor. Or cows. Or trucks. Or anything else farm related. Apparently the block is only big enough for 2 cars. I still disagree!			"

												Don't let the metascore scare you away. This game isn't for everybody, but that doesn't mean it's a bad game. If you like relaxing, slow paced, and somewhat realistic simulators, give this one a look. There are over a hundred different vehichles, and tons of different features. It's also fully moddable, with a thriving modding community. It's bug free, and runs on relatively low end machines. Works on my four year old rig.			"

												Perfectly simulates farming but without the crippling debt, cow turds, and bi-weekly calls to the suicide hotline. However be warned that enjoying this game will cause you to forever wonder at what point in your life it all went wrong, that you're now sitting in your underwear at 2am fretting about the fluctuating price of corn.

												A calming, surprisingly engaging game. Even if you laugh at the concept, it's worth a try if you're after a chillout game but have played Minecraft to death.One thing I would say is that the time you need to invest before you start getting the cool equipment is pretty steep, but there are things you can buy that passively earn money and mean you can earn more than you spend on production.

												My steam account only shows 22 hours on this game as I purchased this digital copy only recently so I could play coop with my six-year-old son.  I’ve played this, the 2011, and the 2009 versions for many countless hours. As background, I have a graduate degree in agriculture economics and have spent a good portion of my life farming.  By all accounts, I should dislike this game: * the controls are clunky* the physics are often aggravating* the particle flow/dust and other graphical elements are a throwback to 1990’s 3D engines* the ‘farming’ elements are incredibly simplistic and the economics are silly.And yet there is something oddly cathartic and relaxing about this game that keeps me coming back for more day after day. I derive the most enjoyment from utilizing some of the many modifications to stretch this game to its limits.  The most important is Courseplay, which allows me to automate most of the tasks and play a managerial role, even though the game it technically a driving simulator.  I also enjoy user-submitted maps, such as Paradise 2013, which are set up for larger operations and automated farming.  Even though I wish the developers would license a better game engine so that the physics, rendering, and particle flow are more realistic, as well as include an 'advanced' mode that actually adjusts growth conditions and incorporates specific pests/weeds that I have to control, I can’t help but think that I’ll keep playing this game for a long time to come.

												This is surprisingly good for something that doesn't even try to hide the fact it's a farming simulator. That said, of course it still *is* a farming simulator, so you *will* be doing some things that are a little more tedious than you'd expect from a typical game. For example, there's no denying that a large part of farm work is driving up and down a field at slow speed, so you will be doing some of that. At the same time you don't have most of the sources of excitement that other open world games have, you're doing honest work (except if you're stealing golf carts, which is possible and apparently nobody cares) so you're not going to be in any police chases or shootouts. The game does a very good job at simulating a farm. You start out with some money, machinery, a loan, and a field (depending on difficulty) and manage the operation from there on. You tend your fields, buy machines, buy more fields, perhaps some animals, and so on, and the level of detail is mostly pretty good. All this takes place in a completely open world, and while you can't buy any cars unless you install mods, there's a very large selection of tractors and other equipment that you can drive around. The nice thing is that equipment generally works like you'd expect it to work: Trailers can be attached to tractors, or in some cases to other trailers, making trains; then you drive them over a grate and press a key to unload your grains, which will happen in a way specific to the type of trailer you're using. Front loaders can pick up things and carry them around, sowers sow, sprayers spray, additional tanks attached to the front of your tractor provide more fertilizer for the sprayer attached to its rear, balers pick up straw and make bales, which you can then pick up with a front loader or another machine that stacks them. Cows produce manure, which you can use to fertilize your fields if you choose to do so, and so forth.The game does try to alleviate some of the tedium by letting you hire help for some of the repetitive driving tasks. For example, plowing, cultivating, sowing, fertilizing, spraying, and harvesting can all be done by a computer controlled clone of you. This is implemented very nicely, you just drive the machine to the starting point and press H and it'll start doing what you'd expect it to do. For example, a combine harvester will start slowly harvesting your field, driving up and down, and eventually stop when it's full. Then you can pull up next to it with a trailer and the computer help will extend the combine's pipe and unload the harvest into your trailer and continue. Similarly if you drive next to it while it's harvesting, it'll transfer the harvest to your trailer as you go. This makes it very easy to do some of the typical farming tasks that normally require more than one person. It also adds an aspect of time management to the game when you have multiple computer controlled helpers working your fields and need to jump around between them to support them.You also don't have to wait for your plants to grow. There are three settings to control how fast plants grow, and separately you can also speed up time by 120x. Machines only work at one fixed pace, though.The farming aspect of this game includes various types of grains, potatoes, beets, as well as cattle (for dairy), sheep (for wool), and chicken (for eggs). Additionally, you can buy green houses that you can freely place on the map to grow things such as herbs or tomatoes, and you can buy bee houses that'll produce honey.In addition to typical farming tasks, there also are some half arsed missions (basically two types: one requires you to pick up something with a front loader, another requires you to mow strangely rectangular areas where grass suddenly appeared on the golf course). You can also buy solar panels and wind energy converters, which will provide a nice consistent stream of extra income (they're a little too good).I'm rating this game a 9 out of 10 because it's a good farming simulator with a very nice open world and very detailed equipment. But as I stated above, it's still a farming simulator, and not an action game, and I would not necessarily expect it to appeal to the same audience as other open world games.			"

												From the moment I started playing this game, it felt like Need For Speed and The Sims had combined into one. From the visually stunning detail on every tractor, to the joy of harvesting that last potato, this game had it all. Want to plant some corn? Go for it! Feel like selling some eggs? You can do that too! The possibilities are endless when you're running your own farm. Why not play with friends? Feel the excitement when you and your buddies connect over the internet webs and spend hours cultivating your first crops. You will never run out of things to do with an extensive range of different sized fields. Form a clan and take on the annual MLG Farming Simulator 2013 Internationals to compete against the top teams of farmers around the world. Need to get somewhere in a hurry? Just steal a golf cart from the local golf club, and even crash it into a lake.  If that's not enough, Titanium Edition comes with 4 new maps and the urban camo assault crossbow. Pick up a copy of game of the year edition and become eligible for Double XP weekends and gain access to the Farming Simulator 2014 multiplayer beta upon release. So what are you waiting for? Become a farmer today!			"

												Boring in description, but oddly addictive. You buy land, till fields, sow seeds, and harvest crops. Much like many simulations, though, there's an underlying satisfaction in setting the groundwork and watching your crops (and fortunes) grow steadily. It can get a little boring later on once you've got steady income and all the equipment you could need to maintain it, but still manages to be a relaxing experience throughout.			"

												Now that the new Farming Simulator 15 has come out, its high time to write down my personal thoughts of 2013 Titanium.This is a game sim about running a modern farm. You get 2 maps to start with, Hagenstedt and Westbridge Hills. The game started off with Hagenstedt, but more content and Westbridge Hills was added later in the Titanium upgrade.So what do you do at your farm?You grow crops, manage ure animals and do missions to put it simply. The crops that you can grow are: Wheat, Barley, Canola, Sugar Beets and Potatoes.The animals you can have are: Cows, Sheep and Chickens.There is also two type of missions you can do: Transport Missions and Mowing. You can freely choose how you play the game, and can freely roam on the map, doing what you like. If you only wanna grow crops, for example, thats just fine. Pros:- The free playstyle, doing what you want, when you want. - Multiplayer. This game is made for it, you can have tons of fun with ure friends working together on the farm.- Loads of equipment. From plows to harvesters. - Easy to learn and get into.- Literally TONS of mods to further enhance your gameplay!Cons: I really cant say bad things about the game, but no game is perfect.- The handling of some machines are wonky and hard to control (but you get used to it.)- Easy to get stuck in fences/rocks and stupid Ai cars. (Fortunately there is a reset function for ure equipment if it flips over or get stuck.)- It sometimes feels like your alone in a empty world just driving your machines in single player. There is Ai cars and people, but still feels empty. (Multiplayer fixes that.)My personal Thoughts:This is one of my favorite types of sim games. The playstyle is relaxed and easy. Might be a bit stressful at harvest time, but other than that, its really a great game. The game flows well, atleast in single player. Lag issues and small freezes can occur in multplayer, but thats not the game´s fault. I had some great fun farming with my friends. Its a perfect co-op game to work at your farm and earn cash for new machinery and expanding your farm.The game has plenty of machines and equipment to choose from and isnt that enough, there is a great mod community that offers tons of mods of all sorts from new maps and new equipment to gameplay mechanics.This is a great game if u like farming sim games. The new one is out, but i recommend to get this new ""classic"" too.			"

												I own both this version (2013) and its successor (2015). I tend to prefer this version to the 2015 version because I am not a fan of the logging focus that was forced into 2015. I think they should have spent their efforts adding more crops and farming styles (like orchards for example). Regardless, they are both EXCELLENT games for those that enjoy an open play style and empire building style. A relaxing and enjoyable experience all around.The Modding community behind these games is AMAZING. If you can imagine it, then someone, somewhere has probably built it. Almost anything you can think of is only a few clicks away from adding it to your game.More than 500 hours played in FS2013 at the time of this review.			"

												I give a thumbs up to the ""Farming Simulator"" franchise.The reasons are:1- Its absolutly relaxing gameplay, the closest you can get to nature without leaving the house.2- It is by far the most deep game that can still be played ""passivly"", meaning you can fullfil other life duties such as reading/ studying and still enjoy this game in the background.3- Has enough activities to engage you when you have more time and choose to play more ""activly"".4- Even provides multiplayer to enjoy with friends!5- Very educational for urban people like me who never even knew a thing or 2 about farming.I will gladly recommend all the versions even today: 2011, 2013, 2015 every game has a set of achievments and the older it is the more basic the gameplay is. So if you are new to the franchise you can happily start from the oldest one but if you are looking for eye candy of course the newer look better ;)			"

												I can recommend this, as well as all the other FS (2011, 2015) only provisionally. First off, my biggest gripe is that it is NOT a farm simulator. There is no element of acually farming except for the equipment... And that's what it really is; a tractor driving simulator. Sure you can plow and spray and blah blah, but none of that really has any affect on the actual yield of a field. Should I plow before I drill? Doesn't matter, you'll get the same yield. Is it going to rain? Doesn't matter, you'll get the same yield. Also, other ""farming"" elements such as weed and pest control are absent. Having said all that, you can drive a variety of equipment for quite a few tasks such as drilling, mowing, raking, blah blah. It's an okay game if you like that sort of thing. I picked it up cheap and I feel I got my moneys worth, but if it were any more money and I'd not have recommended it.			"

												Very slow game to play, be prepared to put many many hours in this, either you will hate it or be very addicted to it. Its always a grind to make more and more money, to get the next best machine or piece of equipment, to get more livestock, and to get new fields. I highly recommend modding the game with simple things like trailers, extra tractors, and trucks these will make the gameplay much more enjoyable.			"

												Semi-open world, quasi-sandbox game about making profit from the land cultivation. No bloodshed, no thrills except of running out of money, questionable challenges... Yet, surprisingly, it's working as the game! Gripping with it's charming simplicity of the peaceful farm life and basic routine to make the day!After trying Agricultural Simulator: Historical Farming recently, I was expecting everything bad from this game. Surprisingly, I was wrong. In fact, Farming Sim 2013 is really decent enough farming simulator - making you an operator of various farmers tools, starting from tractor with plough or fertilizer attached, going with mowers, harvesters, and even a trailer truck to get your stuff to the buyer.You're not get your hands dirty there, there is no actual manual labor (except of picking up eggs, maybe). All that you're supposed to do is to dig up the ground, sow it, fertilize, harvest and prepare the new planting. All by using different vehicles and attachments. And you're not even have to do all those works yourself! There are always convinient farmhand to dig some earth for you. Also there are some passive income sources: bee nests, greenhouses and solar panels - in the end, Farming Sim 2013 can be quite a good idling game. Just plant some stuff here and there, leave it be, and after some days passed, voila! - you're a millionaire! And that's not even a joke.As of downsides, the simulation is far from well-being and from reality in many aspects, starting from engine and physics, going with visuals, stupid gameplay challenges, unhelpful tutorials and so on. It is working - sure, but there is a big question, if you're gonna like it or not.If you're not minding just riding the tractor across countryside, performing some basic tasks here and there - that's good point. If you were ever wandering, what all those variety of tractors and combines are made for - you'll get a proficient picture.If you, however, play the games for thrills and hard challenges - that's not the right title. If you're gonna make yourself a farmer - you're not gonna find much useful info there, as well, as it's all not even covering the basics of the real farmwork.Still, again, as a simulator of farming life - it's working nice enough. Peaceful game, with achievements to unlock and fields to harvest. My mark is 6.5/10.PS: can't vouch for DLCs - they're pretty much the same, except of landscape			"

												Having grown up in a rural area, I helped on various farms during my youth. So I know many of the vehicles that are actually in this game. I also think that the vehicle simulation is pretty good. When you drive tractors, you actually feel like you are pulling something and the harvesters are really fun to operate.  There is also a good variety of crops and getting to all of them takes some effort.What I dislike is the fact that you start out with a really big farm in terms of buildings and stuff. I would so much like to build everything myself, just starting out with a small field and some equipment. I also miss seasons and crop rotations, as well as fatigue.While the game is somewhat shallow in terms of the overall mechanics, it is still a lot of fun to play.			"

												Farming Simulator 2013 I would call it the best game I have played but a good and funny game none the less. By the title you can probably tell it is do with farming and that just what it is. From most simulators I have played this is the most polished and better designed compared to the rest. For me I didn't really know to much about farming and wouldn't be able to tell you a peice of equipment if you asked me about it but after playing this game I began to learn about the equipment and how it was used. It was more of learning excerise I had than a game but it was fun playing with couple of friends here and there if there was nothing else to do. Its not a game I would say have to play but if you and couple of mates are bored I would suggest all getting it and giving it a try. The price at £29.99 is a bit steep.. well.. very steep but I got it on sale when it was under £10 so I didn't pay but if you want to give it a try with mates not that fun to play alone. I would rate this 7/10 not because its a really good game but because of the enjoyment I had with it with friends not best buy but if you have nothing better to do give it a shot.			"

												At the time of writing I am in at 1200+ hrs. The extraordinary thing is the title is a bland, no bells and whistles sim.So what's the attraction?Initially, starting with 1 paddock on the stock map and a small amount of equipment provides an impetus to do what farmers do. Plant, reap, sell, expand. But it doesn't take long to learn the quirks and the cash points so ""expansion"" and accummulation of wealth becomes kinda pointless soon enough.The scenery can be special, the fields and textures quite mundane. Equipment modelling is very nice. The AI can be quite stupid at times (but I couldn't imagine playing this without them) and it's got a definite farm feel. On it's own, it might get 300-400 hours to dedicated tycoon-sim fan.So what is it? What made me do (and will probably continue) over 1200+ hrs of playtime?FS2013, to me, is all about the mods. New maps, new equipment, new fruits, new animals and new ways to do things are offered by a very dedicated modding community and have been since the game first released. The ability to connect the dots to create any specific industry on the farm has increased exponentially. New animal mods, such as the piggery, provide for a very diverse form of infrastructure modelling to run successfully. From grain to root vegetables to water to straw to mixed rations and onwards. Giants themselves have done very little to gameplay and it took them 12 months to release a new map and some new equipment, along with an engine update. They have not added new animals or fruits and even the new farm and new equipment was a DLC purchase. Pretty poor tbh, given the money made (and continues) from this, one of the most popular farming sims out there.Mod it up and it's worth every single cent and will remain a stalwart amongst the box of games we call sims.7/10 unmodded. 9/10 modded.gg			"

												Let me start by saying that this game is one of the most realistic farming games on the market right now(next to farming simulator 2015). There are hundreds of thousands of mods out there to download. Also, this game doesn't just have to be farming, it can be forestry, mud bugging, tractor pulling, what ever u want. I would defientley recommend this game to anyone out there.			"

												I originally bought this game as a joke, but I quickly became engrossed into the life of the farmer. Although the game can be very mundane at times (such as when you're waiting for the rain to stop so you can harvest your damn crops), it is still an overall fun experience, especially if you play with friends.

												Excellent game with great gameplay that never gets boring and brilliantly detailed graphics. The game itself has not story, apart from the story you crate by expanding your one small field into a farming empire with every field on the map under your control! All in all, a great game with so many different paths to explore! 5*			"

Farming Simulator 2013A great upgrade to Farming Simulator 2011.The Titanium edition was that good I had absolutley no need to modify it unlike 2011. The GUI and general gameplay is much better. Looking after animals is better as now you can feed TMR (Total Mixed Rations) as opposed to just silage or grass on 2011. The controls are better which makes things like the front loader fun to use and not rage inducing like 2011. Also one other great feature over 2011 is they got rid of the scarecrow haha.Great modability as usual with Giants games. Unfortunatley the modding community is corrupt, so many lame people using money mods rather than playing legit. This seems to be a curse throughout the FS series. People's first achievement is 1 million in the bank? Also people achieving 10 million before they have harvested 10 hectares? Please. The last achievement I got was 10 million on a farm bringing in 200k a day with cows and wind turbines. With harvest sometimes I could make up to 700k a day when demands were high, but it still took over 40 hours to get that 10 million due to expansion to keep work flow up. Play legit people!Freerider-Dave "

												An interesting insight in to the mundanity (not sure if that's a word!) of farming. Essentially, this game focuses on all the things that bored me when I was a farmer years ago. Plowing seemingly endless fields, before preparing and seeding them again. However, it is a beautifully created game and just not my cup of tea. There is nothing functionally wrong with the game, the level of detail and quality of mods are excellent. I suspect also that if I could stomach playing for a few more days solid I might get more bang for my buckHowever, I have a job and the last thing I want to come home and do after a long day at work is go back to work and plow the fields for a few hours! Sorry, I just found this game intensely dull, it's not overly complex. Plant, harvest, plow, prepare. When you've repeated that, buy some more fields and do it again. I don't know what I was expecting, perhaps something a little more fun like the old days of Sim Farm which had a bit more pace to it. Nevertheless, I'm sure enthusiasts love this game as the attention to detail is exsquisite - so I would recommend this game to anyone who falls into that category. As just an honest gamer looking for something interesting and or fun this didn't hit the mark.			"

												On paper, Farming Simulator 2013 doesn’t seem all that thrilling, but there’s something intangible that keeps me coming back from more. The combination of the excellent community, unwavering focus on running the business, and the simplicity of the controls and your responsibilities creates a unique business simulation that rewards you proportionally to the amount of work you put into it. I’ve genuinely enjoyed playing it, and I’ll continue to do so even after this review is posted. It’s not the prettiest or deepest business simulator, but it would be folly to just dismiss it because of its subject matter. If you are patient and interested in a relaxing game without absolute winning or losing conditions, give it a try.			"

												There's quite a few things that can be said about Farming Simulator 2013. I'd say it is aimed at a specific audience for a start. Some may find the gameplay potentially mind-numbing due to the whole repetitiveness with no action, but personally I find it's not too bad to play, because in some points you can also hire workers if you find it too stretching. It is better with friends (as are most games) as it creates more of a mood as well as splitting up the work between you.Essentially: Start with a little bit of money and some vehicles. Plant stuff, harvest, sell, repeat and get more income so that you're able to upgrade your vehicles, equipment and buy more land to maximise your profit. Pretty much an endless cycle until you have the best equipment and vehicles.The graphics aren't particularly good, but if you're someone that isn't bothered by that - You'll be right.The physics are pretty weird, but that's fine because they're pretty funny to play with. The game can also be customised to a certain degree with a large variety of community maps and vehicles that can be downloaded in.Once again, I say that this game is surely not for everyone, but it's not bad if you don't mind the straight forward farming concept with partial monetary and banking section involved. In final, I'd say pick this up on a sale if you like the look of it. What you see from gameplay and trailers are essentially what you get. You're in charge of your own wallet here.			"

												I wish I could coherently explain why I recommend this game. All there is content wise is exactly what you would expect: farming. You plant crops, fertilize them, watch them grow, harvest them and finally ship them to market. It all sounds dreadfully bland, and in all respects it should be. But it's not.I first saw this game on DocM77's Youtube Channel and honestly I thought it was a joke, but then I found myself thinking ""man I would have not invested that profit there.. woah watch the corners you're losing crop yeild!... right now I would definitely invest in more acreage"" and at that point I realized I really wanted to play this game.Boy did it not let me down, I loved every minute of that tedious harvesting and shipping and I don't have an earthly clue why. Don't judge this game by it's cover. Try it out and I bet you'll surprise yourself :)			"

I bought a windmill, and then called it quits.This is an excellent simulation game on agriculture, and if you are a city slicker like me, you will likely learn some things that you may not know! It was particularly interesting the view the different equipment and learn how to manage cows/slurry/haw/straw/chaff, etc. This is not as simple as it sounds! You will constantly be seeking to optimize your time, and you will work your ♥♥♥ off! digitally, of course! I recommend this game for everyone, if under 20 dollars. "

												It's Minecraft without the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It's Farmville without the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.It's a deconstruction of the whole RPG genre. The only castle you have is your home, the only quests are the future.Yes, it's aggravating at first. You search desperately for the bandits and the dragons and pretty princesses. You watch videos and expect extreme dubstep drops from space.But, spoiler alert, you won't miss such trivialities. The game wakes you up from such petty tropes. What good is a princess with 2 lines of text? Or a recurring enemy who appears hundreds of times in the course of walking from 1 town to another?Farming Simulator 2013 doesn't try lying to you, not once. The game offers you quests every so often, to mow a lawn or haul a crate across the lush, bountiful countryside. A simple diversion to earn a simple amount of cash while your farm hands do the repetitive tasks.And then oh god yes, the multiplayer. Sublime bliss, shared amongst your friends.			"

												If you want a farming simulator, this game is NOT for you but if your want a farming sandbox then this will do the job. Ploughing, cultivating, seeding and fertilizing is like pulling a MS paint brush behind the tractor. They've neglected the add particle animations for cutting crops so they just dissapear in front of the cutter. Physics LOL. Multiplayer can be alot of fun when it works but synchronization occur all too often when using mods or poor connections. The genre has huge potential but I don't see Giants been able pull off a true 'Farming Simulator' anytime soon.			"

Comes with crops like wheat, barley, canola, corn (maize), potatoes, sugarbeet but can add lots more with mods.

												Farmer or not, you will enjoy this game. Farming Simulator 2013 offers a wide range of realistic equipment to suit any farmer. Titanium Edition adds a new American map, Westbridge Hills to the game along with fitting machinery to run the map. As well as this, the Farming Simulator modding community is huge, offering mods from simple scripts to improve gameplay, to tractors, implements and even new maps. BE WARNED: This game is highly addictive and hours will fly by as you wait for your field of wheat to grow, cart corn to the inn to get a little more cash and find yourself mowing grass at the golf course for money so you can fork out for that telehandler you need so much...

												Farming Simulator 2013 Titanium Edition is the newest strange addiction I have experienced. This game looks from the outside like a (you guessed it) FARMING SIMULATOR! I was considering buying this game for 5 months and finaly bought it when it went on sale. I have 5 hours in 1 day. Once you start its oddly addictive. Bring a friend for the farming madness thats about to ensue. If you even consider buying this game for gameplay, buy it, BUY IT NOW! because its much better than it looks (or sounds).11/10 Would Farm Again~Pweedgemen the game buyer guy			"

This game IS farming!You plow your field, cultivate your field, plant your seeds, fertilize your seeds, harvest your crop, perhaps harvest your dry-stalks, recultivate your field, rinse-and-repeat.  You also sell your produce: ergo, you load it up from your silos into your truck/tractor-wagon, you drive it into town, and find the best price!  You buy better equipment: tractors, harvesters, etc (all authentic equipment BTW).  You buy more fields to produce more produce!  Perhaps you raise some livestock......got FARM?			"

												You won't find a better time to try a new game type than the Steam Summer Sale.  That was my justification for buying this one; it's super cheap, and you should be willing to try anything at least once, with an open mind.How is this game?  Let me give you an elaborate analogy: if gaming is like eating, then your 60-hour RPGs are the heavy turkey dinner.  FPSs are like the coffee afterward.  Indie platformers are the sugary deserts, 2D fighters are the alternate pasta entree, and MOBAs are the pizza the loud guys upstairs are having.THIS game is like the nap you have after eating too much.  The caffeine buzz has time to wear off, you feel a little less heavy because you've digested that turkey, and you're nice and relaxed because all your dinner guests have gone home.  The upstairs neighbors have gone to a sports bar to watch the game.This game is like taking a nap with your eyes open.  The first 2 stages of the tutorial were, collectively, a nice 32-minute nap.

Although because of all the time spent on it my dog died from malnutrition and porkchop bones it ate off my numerous plates because I am too drawn to this game to do the dishes. It's fantastic. It has traktors, plants, animals (that you can't see, probably ninjas, or black), and people. I bought this game on sale and it's titanium edition so I knew I couldn't be getting a better deal. But the game was so good I went back and paid full price when the sale was over. That's how fantastic it was. Then I saw Jesus farming my field, but the game spelled his name wrong and it looked something like De Jesus. I knew at that moment this game was endowed by our celestial creator n schtuff. I give this game 8 steamy streamy creamy wooples out of 10 moist Mexican steampiles.			"

												I know what you're thinking.  ""Farming sim? Who would want to do that?"".  Well, that's a good question Billy.  Let's sit down and figure this one out, shall we?  I would say this game appeals to a side of me where you start out with very little and you have to work to improve what you have.  Games like Minecraft, Harvest Moon, The Sims, etc.  Now I'm not saying you are going to dig for diamonds and fight zombies and creepers, nor am I saying this is exactly like Harvest moon or whatever.  I'm just saying that in those games you're started off without much and you have to work to make your world grow.  Likewise, they start you off with a single field and a few tractors and a bank loan, and from there you have to pay off the loan, plant your crops, figure out the best time to sell your crops, and in general keep finding new ways to make money.If you want to be lame, you can buy windmills, and solar panels and a bunch of other easy money-making items.  These items require very little to no maintenance and you earn money every day.  There's no challenge in that though.  You might want one so that you have some steady income while you're working 5 fields at once and hiring 2-3 workers to keep things moving as you jump from tractor to tractor.  You don't want to be able to just walk away and come back 8 hours later to find you're filthy rich though.There's plenty to do in this game.  You can play the original map (in Germany?) or now with the Titanium edition, you can play the same game with a more American theme.  There's cows for milk, sheep for wool, chickens for eggs, and several crops to plant (some of which require special machinery). You also need to learn where to sell your eggs and wool as well as how to feed your cows so your milk output is at its best,  When you feel like exploring there are some hidden items in the map that  you can collect (it doesn't really affect the game so you can ignore it if you like) and occasionally there are some side-jobs you can take on for extra cash.The only thing that's missing in single-player is an actual economy.  Prices will go down if you flood the market with a certain type of crop, but other than that, demand seems to be purely random.  There are no competing farmers for your crops so you merely wait for the best time to sell (except maybe in the early days when you have the loan to pay off).Fortunately, you can play this game online so it doesn't feel so empty...and it's a lot of fun to cooperate with farm work, though you'd need mods to get ""paid"" for your work in an online game.   If this game had a neighboring farm that you could cooperate with and/or compete with, and if there was an actual economy that was reflected in the prices (instead of price changes to simulate an economy), this game would be perfect.Still, as you can see, I've spent a lot of time playing this, and that was mostly before the titanium edition.  I've only just begun a game on the new map.  If you enjoy the satisfaction of building up a farm (or an empire or whatever) this game will have a lot to keep you interested.  It can also be relaxing to just chill out as you are taking care of the farm business.			"

												Y'er game's got farming?  This game IS farming!You plow your field, cultivate your field, plant your seeds, fertilize your seeds, harvest your crop, perhaps harvest your dry-stalks, recultivate your field, rinse-and-repeat.  You also sell your produce: ergo, you load it up from your silos into your truck/tractor-wagon, you drive it into town, and find the best price!  You buy better equipment: tractors, harvesters, etc (all authentic equipment BTW).  You buy more fields to produce more produce!  Perhaps you raise some livestock......got FARM?			"

I have played many sim games over the last ten years and this has to rate in the top five. There are several issues but nothing that stops one from having a great expereince playing this game. My one major grip would be with the mods. I find many of the trucks and cars modded for this game are WAY out of scale. Its not often you see a car or a pickup truck larger then a semi truck or tractor yet in FS 2013 mods this is all to common, that said with some looking around one can find a few out there that are close to the right scale.

												At first glance you will ask yourself, ""How could this be fun at all, it's farm work and that is boring!"" Well let me tell you as a player of action and adventure games I thought the same.But if you give it a chance, and play with friends, it's one of the most relaxing games to play.You get a sense of satisfaction from just playing along with friends or family to create and expand a nice little farm.By no means will this ever get your blood pumping but if you play competitive games and get stressed out this can be the perfect thing to cool off with.Now mind you I only suggest this game be played with friends or family, as solo it can be rather lonely, and with strangers it can be... well it's the internet you can guess what sort of things can happen, but don't be afraid to try and make new friends, just don't expose your best save games to them for awhile ^^.All in all a good relaxing game when shared.

												An absolute awesome game. If you love business & farming; this game is awesome. It has a really awesome co-op section and ability to use mods to make your farming experience even better. Take a small farm and turn it into a massive empire! Myself and a friend made over $25 million dollars farming. One of my favourite games for sure!The only draw back is after some time the gameplay becomes very painful and the maintenance on the farm becomes repetitive and time consuming to the point where boredom sets in. You HAVE TO play this with a friend or 2. You cannot do everything yourself and if you do you will not make as much money, you won't get everything done quickly and you will get seriously bored.Do take a look at the communities for mods. There are some awesome mods to add new features, new equipment, enhanced graphics mods & new farms that can be simply added to your game with ease. I am currently using 44 different mods for my version.			"

												I know what you're thinking.  ""Farming sim? Who would want to do that?"".  Well, that's a good question Billy.  Let's sit down and figure this one out, shall we?  I would say this game appeals to a side of me where you start out with very little and you have to work to improve what you have.  Games like Minecraft, Harvest Moon, The Sims, etc.  Now I'm not saying you are going to dig for diamonds and fight zombies and creepers, nor am I saying this is exactly like Harvest moon or whatever.  I'm just saying that in those games you're started off without much and you have to work to make your world grow.  Likewise, they start you off with a single field and a few tractors and a bank loan, and from there you have to pay off the loan, plant your crops, figure out the best time to sell your crops, and in general keep finding new ways to make money.If you want to be lame, you can buy windmills, and solar panels and a bunch of other easy money-making items.  These items require very little to no maintenance and you earn money every day.  There's no challenge in that though.  You might want one so that you have some steady income while you're working 5 fields at once and hiring 2-3 workers to keep things moving as you jump from tractor to tractor.  You don't want to be able to just walk away and come back 8 hours later to find you're filthy rich though.There's plenty to do in this game.  You can play the original map (in Germany?) or now with the Titanium edition, you can play the same game with a more American theme.  There's cows for milk, sheep for wool, chickens for eggs, and several crops to plant (some of which require special machinery). You also need to learn where to sell your eggs and wool as well as how to feed your cows so your milk output is at its best,  When you feel like exploring there are some hidden items in the map that  you can collect (it doesn't really affect the game so you can ignore it if you like) and occasionally there are some side-jobs you can take on for extra cash.The only thing that's missing in single-player is an actual economy.  Prices will go down if you flood the market with a certain type of crop, but other than that, demand seems to be purely random.  There are no competing farmers for your crops so you merely wait for the best time to sell (except maybe in the early days when you have the loan to pay off).Fortunately, you can play this game online so it doesn't feel so empty...and it's a lot of fun to cooperate with farm work, though you'd need mods to get ""paid"" for your work in an online game.   If this game had a neighboring farm that you could cooperate with and/or compete with, and if there was an actual economy that was reflected in the prices (instead of price changes to simulate an economy), this game would be perfect.Still, as you can see, I've spent a lot of time playing this, and that was mostly before the titanium edition.  I've only just begun a game on the new map.  If you enjoy the satisfaction of building up a farm (or an empire or whatever) this game will have a lot to keep you interested.  It can also be relaxing to just chill out as you are taking care of the farm business.			"

												This game is truly a masterpiece of its genre. At first, it seems like a simple farming game, until out of nowhere there are North Korean soldiers overrunning your peaceful farm. Fighters and bombers soar overhead, aircraft drop legions of paratroopers onto the farmland you so meticulously tilled as you realize that you, a lone farmer, are the last line of defense from foreign invaders. You prepare for war by breaking out that rifle you kept to ward off thiefs, along with thousands of rounds of ammunition, rocket launchers, grenades, anti aircraft guns, and that Davy Crockett you kept for those special occasions. As you fight through your blood soaked little property, you must continue to make those crucial crop deliveries in order to help sustain the crumbling war effort. The delivery missions are brutal, as you must guide your tractor convoy to its destination through complex ambushes, IEDs, and indirect fire.

												An all-around enjoyable game.  Farming Simulator 2013 is a fairly realistic simulation that becomes only as stressful as you want it to be.  Keep it simple with just a few fields in rotation, or continue purchasing acres and manage the harvesting of several crops simultaneously with help of hired hands, all before the rains hit!  There are also seperate missions to boost your income, animals to tend, the continual feeding of grass clippings into the biogas plant which produces fertilizer for your crops, and an active modding community producing new maps and equipment to download and enhance gameplay.  As other reviewers have illuded, as  much as I have enjoyed games like Minecraft and Skyrim over the years, this game has been a nice alternative to the constant stress of exploring creeper-infested mines and caverns, or having to fight for your life forever threatened by orcs, goblins, trolls, zombies, and every other horrific imaginings.  You'll too see how relaxing it is to sit back in your shiny new harvester and chew up row after row of wheat as the sun sets over the distant mountains... Enjoy!			"

												I never thought I would be one to play this kind of sim but I'm glad I did. This is now officially my wind down game. When I'm playing this I can take time building my own farm. No trying to out run zombies or getting to pole position here. The game is sandbox and pretty much leaves you to run the farm how you feel fit. As you earn money you can invest it into new equipment, farm expansion and livestock. There is quite a good tutorial that explains how the various different vehicles in the game work. On top of that there are various mods around as well which further expand the game.The graphics are quite nice with weather changes and day / night cycles. Crop growing can take a while so fortunately there are options in the game such as time increase where you can speed things along. The scenery is quite nice and rural. There is also a nearby village with people and traffic so you feel more like part of a community.The vehicles themselves are quite detailed and its a bit like being a kid again where you get to play with all those farm toys. You can even hire workers for some and just stand by a field while watching them work on it.This won't be for everyone but if you are looking for a more laid back kind of sim that involves farming then this should do the job.

												This is an amazing game for those kids that grew up in a house next to a farm where the very activity in this game was going on all day, but never had their own opprotunity to do this. The game is true to real life, as everything develops slowly just like it would in real life. You can easily spend an entiire game day sowing and planting fields just as they would in real life. The graphics are amazing for a game of this calliber, and the gameplay is very smooth, though there are minor glithces here and there, they are quite entertaining, and not game breaking. With outside content that can be downloaded, you can add a different variety of tractors, adding on to the empire you can build. I would recommend this game to anybody that grew up playing with combines and tractors as a kid.			"

												Just for thoose calm, people who like smulators, this is a slow game, where you take your time slowly starting with the bare minimum equptment and in dept. Having to do manual work for a while, eventually, you work your way to owning atleast 20 fields (some are larger then others, and other maps have more of them). You even hire lots of workers to run your fields. I reccomend, finding some mods, and downloading more maps for the game.			"

												The best farming simulator on the market, and I speak from experience. I've tried playing Agricultural Simulator from UIE (UIG?) Software, but getting it to run without encountering graphical corruption or crashing would be a miracle at higher graphics settings. Giant's Farming Simulator may not have the photo-realistic graphic detail of thier competitor, but the game is much more stable, even at the highest graphics settings. A must have for anyone who enjoys farming and the outdoors!			"

												Just for thoose calm, people who like smulators, this is a slow game, where you take your time slowly starting with the bare minimum equptment and in dept. Having to do manual work for a while, eventually, you work your way to owning atleast 20 fields (some are larger then others, and other maps have more of them). You even hire lots of workers to run your fields. I reccomend, finding some mods, and downloading more maps for the game.			"

												Summary: A game for those who don't care whether their farm has aliens they need to fight off, or NPCs they can romance. This game doesn't have that. It has farming equipment and a great environment for people looking for a relaxing evening or a great co-operative experience with friends who enjoy simulated farming with heavy equipment. Hours of fun: *Varies - If you like simulators then it may well be infiniteSuggested Retail Value: $20Graphics: 7/10Voice-acting: NA - No voice-actingMusic/SFX: NA - Calm music on menus onlyUniqueness: 5/10First Play-through Experience: 8/10Replay Value: 9/10If you have any love for simulated farming then I doubt you would regret paying up to $20 for the full version. I was introduced to the game through a friend who had put in 100s of hours and just convinced me to give it a try so I could experience what he loved so much about it. I didn't expect it to be this much fun, but it's a blast on co-op play.  After a stressful day, I can sit back and relax and handle issues as they rise. Choosing to pace myself in the game by switching it to real-time and literally doing needed chores then watching the beautiful sunset or... whatever. Then, when I'm feeling ambitious, we both hop into our private server and divy up the tasks at hand, co-operating in beautiful harmony to bring our farm ever closer to being a mega-success. It's hard to describe how it feels to grow a farm from humble beginnings with one small field to a booming business with dozens of fields, 1000s of tons of equipment, and a ranch boasting hundreds of animals, but I highly recommend sharing it with friends. To help with that, the game has an incredible community. Whether you're looking to see the mods that are available, wanting to create your own, looking for a buddy to chat with while you drive the harvesters, or wanting to join a sever with dozens of players trying to achieve a shared farm (even splitting up the tasks, creating jobs, dolling out wages, the whole deal!) the truth is you'll find it all here. I say this about few games (Skyrim readily comes to mind) but FS 2013 feels less like a game and more like a world you visit for as long as you like. Highly recommended if the above sounds interesting to you.			"

												Easily the BEST gaming experience I've ever had on a computer. Forget hours of questing in Skyrim, just plant a few seeds and watch with wonderment as your farm fields flourish into beautiful lush expanses of wheat. Other games may draw attention with their colourful and exotic mounts, however, can they compete with a wide selection of tractors and utility farming equipment - I doubt it! Acquire a variety of financial skills through the buying and selling of produce. Enhance your logistical capabilities through careful planning of scheduled irrigation and farm maintenance. Ultimately, this game has it ALL - Don't waste your time with anything else. Farming Simulator 2013 is where the good times are at! Buy it up kids!			"

												This game aint just some bs ""simulator"" that doesnt even simulate the thing that it's supposed to simulate.This game is a masterpiece - it's badassness and awesomeness and all that crap just cant squeeze into this poopy review. You need to play this.Doesnt matter if you have any friends to play with - you wont need them. This game can offer you BETTER AI FRIENDS that can do almost everything you want them to do for a fixed price 1$/an hour. Damn, it even has a tractor that doesnt have wheels, it uses TANK TRACKS INSTEAD. You can plug a long-♥♥♥ trailer that matches the size of your member (it grows more and more if you actually play this game (confirmed)) to it's back and ride that bic all day long from your pimp-crop fields to all places where you can make tons of lettuce by just dumping all the crap your AI BETTER FRIENDS had grown in them.This game is worth whatever it costs, and i'd reccomend you to buy this mofo as soon as you can -  The Farming Mother♥♥♥♥ing Simulator 2015 is coming. Remember - the more you play, the more your member grows. Legit.			"

												I think Farm Simulator 2013 is a great game with many options to start with. I really like that it is a free will world. Which means it gives you a chance to explore and you can decide how you want to play and make money. It is fun in my opinion. I also like that if you get bored playing alone you have the option for multiplayer where friends can play too! FS13 is an awesome game!Farm Simulator 2015 (FS15) is even better, though I enjoy both games.			"

												I have played this game more than any other in my library. While mundane on the surface this game is in depth, engaging and challenging. I would recommend this game to anyone who has an attention span of more than 5 seconds, however if you cannot make decisions for yourself, patiently cultivate and harvest crops, or find joy in admiring your golden fields of crop then this game may not be for you.

												Arguably one of the best Farming Simulation games in existance.  With the added ability of hosting a dedicated server (through a 3rd party, I used Nitrado) this game brings in the multiplayer aspects that Farming Simulator has been failing at until now.  The modding community is pretty good behind this game, as well mods are very easy to install on both client and server ends.  Animals exist in this version, however their use isn't highly detailed.  You simply provide them with the proper materials at their pens and the game calculates the rest.  That said, I would still highly recommend this game for anyone who's been searching for a good farming simulation game.			"

												This game is a friggin' job! I was hoping there'd be more management involved, and less hands-on involvement. But I find myself driving a tractor all the time. Hiring help costs money and speeding up time only affects the growth of crops. And when I'm not tending crops, I'm driving stuff all over the place trying to make money. It gives me the unpleasant feeling of doing chores all the time. What's next: a game about doing the dishes?! I understand the apppeal to some people, but it's just not for me. And to think they could've easily added some features to (optionally) turn this game into somewhat of an RTS. That way, they could've marketed it to 2 demographics instead of just one niche. Thank god this game cost only 4 euros. Well, I'm off mowing the lawn - in real life.			"

I'm pretty ashamed that this is the 4th highest played game on my list, but man its addictive! I just want a bigger better tractor!!!For: Addictive, if you like upgrades this is for you, its got huge machinary! Did i mention its as addictive as cocaine?Against: a bit clunky at times, sometimes feels like FarmVille for boys as you stand there literally watching crops grow.Good fun and pretty cheap now, plus... multiplayer!

I would not reccomend buying this game.  Someone talked me into it and I regret my purchase from the moment I launched the sim.  It is true there are tons of mods, but the mods do not make up for the silly physics.			"

Granted it does take a while to get to the large plots of land to farm, and the better  farm equipment, but once you got it and keep moving up in the game.The graphics are decent but not high end.the game is rather stableThe DLC's mite be a tad over pricedAdding Mods is rather easyover all i enjoy this game. just wish i could cut the trees down in some places, and that i could change to a female character.other then that, it is alot of fun.

												I have potato blood in my veins.  My live is potato, in your working live and in you're living it's always potatoes.  I dream of potatoes.  When we are going to harvest in your mind and in your heart, you feel that you are going to export the potatos and you are not going to see it anymore.  Dat hurt.  The family thinks always from morning to evening about the potatoes.			"

												Farming Simulator 2013 is actually a good game to chill, just sit down after school/work, expand your farm and grow something on your fields. It's not frustrating at all. Has a lot of mods over the internet and has multiplayer mode. Unfortunately you cant just make a server, you need to rent it as it is a dedicated server so it's not really accesible to many people but its still fun to play multiplayer. Sometimes the game is on sale so you can get it for 4 or 5 euros and it's really worth it, especially if you want to chill and if you like tractors :D			"

												The farming and economy is very simple - harvest the crop you start with, sell it, plant grass.  Repeat daily: harvest, convert grass to silage, sell silage for bio-fuel.  What's left is a driving game, but you get to drive some great vehicles!  Even half an hour driving up and down a field mowing the grass can be fun with toys like these.The 'missions' (mow the grass - for a change! - or deliver a pallet) are annoying after a while but can be turned off.  Lifestock also add little  but you might as well have some hens (don't require looking after) and sheep (load-up their feeding trough with cut grass, see paragraph 1, and they're good for a week).  Cows are harder to feed because you need straw as well as grass (plus its variants silage, also above, and hay).  Should you venture into the exciting world of bovine husbandry you therefore have to grow wheat and/or barley as well as grass.  Apart from needing re-seeding after each harvest it benefits from fertiliser so now you can drive up and down each field FIVE times per day.Somehow, it's still a lot of fun.			"

												I'm giving this game a contingent ""yes"". If you played FS2013, this is disappointing, if this is you're first time, then you'll like it. It's a good game overall but adds almost nothing in the 2 years since FS2013. Sure logging has been added but this is a game about farming, and very little has been done in the actual farming department. First off, let me say this is definitely FARMING simulator and not USING FARMING VEHICLES simulator. What I mean by that is the concept of farming, what to do and how to do it in terms of growing crops is solid. What's not solid is the actual gameplay of the vehicles. The physics is pretty bad. The vehicles have no weight to them, accelerate and decelerate instantly, and have horrible turning physics (I'm NOT referring to the turning when you are attached to a tool but do not have a counter-weight up front, that is good attention to detail, but turning in general is awful). The cockpits are alright, but nothing lights up, very few instrument gauges work, and nothing is clickable. A few new vehicles have been added, mostly those associated with the new tree logging though.Furthermore, nothing has been improved when it comes to growing crop. You still have the same options and equipment. You'd think the devs with all this time would add something new like beans or even vinevards or fruit trees, but no, same as FS2013. Same can be said for farm animals. Nothing changed. You also get the same side, repetitive side missions. This is a REAL big disappointment, 2 years and the devs can't even think of a new side mission? The world still feels so empty and unlived in. There is no sense of ""people"" living around you. If you go into the one town you might see a one or two people walking but that's about it. There is some traffic but its not convincing at all. There is no AI really and they drive at like 5 mph for some reason. I wish the game gave you a reason to use your lights and turn signals when on the road, but with such unbelieveable traffic there's no option in even pretending to role play. At this point you might be wondering why I'm recommending this game after saying only negative stuff about it. Well, if you haven't played FS2013, then you won't be so disappointed. The game itself is very fun and makes you think about how to manage your crop and sell it at the biggest profit. The little side missions are fun (considering you haven't played FS2013) for the first few hours and are a nice change for pace from normal farming. The graphics are generally nice and reasonably well-detailed. A nice touch added is that your tractor and farming equipment now get dirty with use and can be cleaned off with a pressure washer (although equipment gets dirty way too quickly). Overall it's a solid game, especially if this is your first time. If you ever see this on sale for $20 or less, I'd say definitely pick it up if you're interested. At full MSRP however, you should checkout some gameplay and really think about if this is the kind of game you'd enjoy. If you're someone who plays a lot of sim games, then the answer will probably be yes. If not, maybe wait for a sale to get the most fun/$ out of it			"

												A good bit of improvement since 2011, xinput works (analog fwd+rev triggers for xbox controller), and the game is much more complete.Mod support is strong as always with farming simulator games, if you want a vehicle or a feature thats not in the game, there's probably a mod for it if not two or three.Runs great on Mac and PC, would not reccomend trying to use a controller on mac, it's probably doable but I've tried 3 controllers and only one of them worked (logitech dual action).  xbox360 wired controller and logitech f310 did not work at all.

												Ok, just one more crop before I go to bed....♥♥♥♥, it's 6am.People laugh and scoff at the idea of Farming Simulator, but you can't deny the 90%+ positive reviews. That's what ultimately led me to give it a try (and it was $4 on sale). This game is really fun, even if you're mainly chugging through to get the achievements like I did at first. Then you realize this is a really great sim game.It's a steeper learning curve than most, but with guides you can adjust easily. The scope is a little overwhelming at first too, but it certainly takes patience (just like real crops?). Gameplay is addicting and fun. Haven't tried MP, but looks like it's almost essential to keep from going mad (there's a LOT to do and keep tabs on).Graphics aren't bad, and no real bugs from what I've encountered so far. A solid game. Mod community is big, and plenty to download.If you like any kind of city building or other sim games you have to give this one a go. 8/10+Gameplay is fun and solid+Graphics on par for a non AAA title in '13+Modding community+DLCs are fun but not required to enjoy the full game-Clunky interface-Tutorial only covers machine operation-Physics not always consistent			"

												You may ask why I am reviewing this game when there has been 2 successors since this. To be honest I cannot answer that. I just felt like reviewing it.ANYWAY on with the review... This game is often under £2 on steam sales and is sometimes great to come back to for a laugh or to look at some of the great mods that are sometimes better than FS15/17 mods. FS 2013 is one of my oldest owned games (not on steam, on the Mac App Store) so for me it is nice to look back on for memories. :')			"

												The game has alot of depth and variety to the simulation gameplay.  I have played many Farming/Agricultural Simulator games previously and to date this game with over 150 hours of game play is my favorite of the Famring Simulators.  For me a good simulator must have a business simulation aspect to it.  And this game does a great job at that.  I enjoy the rewards of raising crops and animals to earn money in order to further grow my farm, buy land, buy animals and add more equipment.  The other aspect that this game really expands on is the mods.  Almost limitless modding.I would rank this simulation game just above Euro Truck Simulator 2.  Both are great simulation games and are in my top 15 simulation games of all time.			"

I really enjoyed the challenge of making the right decisions to etsbalish the business correctly with the right machinery inventory. This game is far from just driving machines in straight lines.

												6.5/10.  This game is great for someone who is REALLY into ploughing fields.  I mean REALLY.  The trucks and equiptment are nice and there is quite a bit of variety, but it's definitely more of a game about vehicles and farming technicallities than planting crops or raising animals.  The low rating is only because it was not really advertised directly as such, and therefore I thought it might have more to do with animal husbandry etc.  Great game if you're into the other, technical, physical side of farming.

												Are you reading for some farming!?  Well, there's a great series out that allows you to farm that's just for you!!  The nice, relaxing and serene environment of the country as you harvest many types of vegetables and fruit.  I am, of course, talking about the Harvest Moon series.This, however, is not Harvest Moon.  It can barely be classified as a game.  There are no goals, no physics and no one else on the farm.  I may just be a simple suburb folk but I'm pretty sure that realistic farms are a multiperson job even with tractors.Oh, yeah.  There are some people.  They drive in cars and don't seem to react at all when you drive your farming equipment over them or tip them over.   If you have some cash to spend, you could probably have a much more enjoyable time by going down to your local Sherwin Williams, buy some paint, toss it at your wall and watch it dry.   Mmmm...lovely paint drying...Certainly much more enjoyable than this locust infestation.			"

												I played for an hour. I still don't get it. All I did was drive an extremely slow tractor towards a destination that was pointess. I mean wouldnt a farmer at least have a pick up truck and a map? I am done with this game for now, and unless I get an urge to  sing a good john denver song and drive a pathetically slow tractor, I will not go back. Don't wast your time here its junk. If the developers or indies could find a way to combine this game with farm giants economy, then  I would want to play that game.			"

												This game is like a rollercoaster ride! When I say rollercoaster ride I really mean those horrible tractor rides at local fairs which go against all health and safety protocols. Anyway back to the game. Farming Simulator 2013 feels very empty and I cant quite put my finger on it... Could it be the lack of interaction between you and the environment along with the lifeless NPCs which share very similar player models. The fact that you just a floating head and most of the work can be done without you adds to the point that this world is lifeless and frankly dull.Now I am writing this in 2016 so many people may be saying, ""this game is three years old, give it a break"". The first statement is true however if we compare it to other games from the same year you begin to see really how bland it is. Grand theft auto 5, The last of us, Bioshock Infinite, Tomb raider  and battlefield 4 are only a selection of games which were released in 2013 and are still enjoyable.The controls are sloppy and the Interface is very basic. Not really much else to say about the actual.Farming Simulator is not. Who really wants to simulate manual labour in a world populated by 2D mountains and the same dead NPC. Not me really. One factor to take into consideration is that it has a multiplayer option which can be quite fun with friends until you realise the only thing to do is plow the same fields over and over again.So no I do not recommend this game, unless you are training to be a farmer. This game could actually teach you a lot about how you should not waste your time on this Earth playing a flimsy simulator based around a motionless town.Goodnight.			"

												For a person who has never farmed before or who has little knowledge about the different vehicles it's confusing to understand. Plowing a single field takes anywhere from 5-10 minutes. I understand that it is casual but it just seems like a really long time to achieve anything. You have to drive fairly far to sell crops and, it just isnt that satisfying to me. It's a good game, i wouldn't reccomend spending 27.99 on it.			"

												I tried to love this game. For some reason the idea of farming / sustainable agriculture really appeals to me, so I thought this game would be fun. Instead I find myself wondering why I am mowing pretend grass when I should be mowing the real thing? There just isn't much of a game here, so it lacks in fun and on the simulator side - well lets just say its lacking there too.			"

												Not what I expected at all. Bought this for my missus as I thought it would be like sim farm where you had your workers to do this for you. She didn't have a clue so I bought it myself to do the tutorial and I could teach her. Didn't realise you had to actually do the whole bloody lot yourself, get in the tractor, pick up the tool... drive around the field.Bugger that... too slow.. too dull.... mistake to buy for me. Maybe my fault for not reading so much but the opening movie gives no indictation of how this works at all. It makes it look like a ""settlers farming""... not a full on farming simulation.			"

												I love this game and I hate it. I love sims and farming and all that stuff that's boring, and this does all that. The only problem with it is the physics. It's like farming on Mars. Carrying a pallet on your forklift and hit a bump, have fun chasing it down and spending the next 5 minutes lining your forks back up just right to load it up and have it sailing off into oblivion the next bump you hit. Get your sheep going, finally get a few pallets of wool together and loaded on the trailer? Make sure not to turn that trailer because, as we all know, any sort of turn sends your load flying off. Accidentally hit Q on your harvester? Better bring your forklift over to try to flip your implement for the next 10 minutes.Accidentally put grass in your hopper instead of grains, have fun tilling that field for the next half hour and never getting it quite right.It's just bad. It could be a great game but it just isn't. Models are great, the towns are OK, gameplay is decent aside from the just terrible physics. Accidentally hitting one key will cost you 20 minutes of frustration. If you buy this game I suggest you save often because it's better to load 10 minutes back than try to recover from the slightest mistake.			"

												It is that time again, yes. What could compell you to buy this title? It's definitely not a pvp game or competition of any kind, but there is something extremely relaxing to play this game in multiplayer, it's sort of a bonding experience if you can convince your friends to buy this. It has pretty much all the ""paid DLC features"" that FS2011 had, a much bigger array of real life brands and implemented some of the community mods.Oh yeah, this game also shine by it's vibrant modding community.It's sort of boring alone, and sort of fun in MP, it's also cheap.

												DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS DEVELOPER!!!! After 2 versions of this game we still can not get technical support on their products. Anything by Giants software you buy at your own risk. If it does not work they will not help you. They do not respond on their own technical support forum. They continue to put out sub par software and expect the community to fix it for them.Steam should be ashamed of themselves promoting software on their site that you can not get technical support for.I guess it is true that it is all about the buck and to hell with the customers.

												Mechanics are clunky at best, controls frequently leave you feeling rather hamfisted, and the gameplay is centered around pure grinding interspaced with some really bad 'challenges'. Purcahsed to test it as something to get my nephews, but will pass on this. Barely keeps young kids who love heavy equipment interested, and the slow unlock progression makes it hard to get them new toys to play with. 'Simulation' is more than a little misleading for a genre catagory to place this game in.			"

												A better suited name for this would be Farming Simulator Arcade: this simply is not ""simulation"" enough. After being surprised by the excellent Euro Truck Simulator 2, I was expecting sort of the same experience, only with cows and grain instead of long nightly drives through Germany. And with multiplayer! But I was let down…To be fair: the game can be fun, especially on a LAN with some friends, country music on the speakers and a bottle of Jack to pass around. And the models of the farming machines are pretty nice and detailed as well. However, many things simply are a let-down or maybe wasted potential. For example, the rear mirrors are not functioning, essentially making it impossible to play the game first person when driving. And don’t get me started about the dreadful physics engine powering it all: you will encounter gravity defying bouncing farming equipment at regular intervals (and pray those will not get stuck in the scenery). Also, there are no real management options: you can hire some dumb helping hands but that is about it. Even an ancient game like Sim Farm had this. And speaking of Sim Farm: why is there no option to actually upgrade the farm itself (beyond the buying of extra fields).Hopefully future versions will fix some of the issues I had with this game, since there is some great potential here. But for now I cannot really recommended it, unless it’s really cheap in some sale and you have some friends to enjoy it with.			"

Original Review 5/31/14
Updated Review 11/8/14

Overall Rating: 4/10

Pros:
+ Good graphics
+ Easy controls
+ Kindof simulates farming in a realistic way
+ Lots of places to explore in the map

Cons:
- Only one map to explore
- Collision isn't detected in places it should be (you can walk straight through pedestrians and some other objects)
- You can't go physically inside any buildings; things are bought with question-marks and other symbols
- Some of the textures up close get blurry
- Gets boring quickly unless you're using mods or playing multiplayer
- A few repetitive textures (cars, pedestrians, etc.)

The game isn't awful, but they could add more to it. Being able to have interaction with things in the game would help, like going inside buildings, pedestrians talking to you, things like that.  "

												Do not play this game it is so ♥♥♥♥ you will literally die if you touch it, By this I mean that when you get to 4 freaking workers, you can get no more rendering the 40 odd fields available useless in multiplayer. Sort it out. I was really enjoying this game until i realised we could not get another worker, we only had 3 fields and it was totally reliant on the workers to drive the Combines while we collected the crops they harvested. Really disappointing when you have spent hours getting to the point i was at. They had better fix this problem for 2015 or heads will role, ♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												I have been stuggle with getting the multiplayer to work since the game released. I purshase is as brand-new and still after 1 year I can't get the online to work.Basically I lost connection in-game. I have tried everything as portfowarding and all that. So for me 100% waste of money as for multiplayer was the only reason why I would play. I have loads of other games and other simulator games as well but never have I had any online issue, not even on farm sim 2012. So if you are going to play multiplayer, think twice.			"

You should simply use the wildcard *.* for hard drives. Let  your customers choose where they  want to install their product at please?It would really make a lot more sense to do things this way?

												Pretty much what I expected, but needs work in my opinion. There is no management, no depth, no challenge.The multiplayer is non - existant, though there seems to be a market for it. Some dedicated servers would be cool here. The level difficulty is awful. Easy is tutorial and far too easy to bother with. Normal is easy. Hard says - you start off in debt, workers cost more to hire. Okay, so going into the game I start off with a random 8000 dollars, I don't seem to have any debt or loan at all. Workers cost more to hire yes, but I hired them anyway and still got a profit. Also managed to sell my two useless tractors for 18,000. Then decided to open the shop, and oh....I can only buy the very most basic items, and only one type of some to do the entire map. This level isn't hard, its just pointless as you now cannot progress.Also, the devs seem to have plopped down this empty shell of a sim, and from then til now and forever, are just churning out dlc with new tractor bits from various companies. How about you add to the game more...?Other players put it well for me -''What I dislike is the fact that you start out with a really big farm in terms of buildings and stuff. I would so much like to build everything myself, just starting out with a small field and some equipment. I also miss seasons and crop rotations, as well as fatigue.While the game is somewhat shallow in terms of the overall mechanics,''''6.5/10. This game is great for someone who is REALLY into ploughing fields. I mean REALLY. The trucks and equiptment are nice and there is quite a bit of variety, but it's definitely more of a game about vehicles and farming technicallities than planting crops or raising animals. The low rating is only because it was not really advertised directly as such, and therefore I thought it might have more to do with animal husbandry etc. Great game if you're into the other, technical, physical side of farming.''

												If you enjoy living your real life but wish it was slightly more restricted and boring, this game is probably great for you. If not, I would pass on this. This game was given to me by a friend so I have mostly experienced the multiplayer. If you are not player 1, you can't feed animals or see that they are creating goods, which is confusing. We spent a long time trying to get our tractors unstuck from each other before finding out there's a button for that. Nothing in this game is obvious or intuitive so we were just kind of confused.

												This is basicly NOT a farm simulator and more of a driving simulator for REALLY slow things.  You cant ""plan"" and watch anything you literally have to drive your tractor and plow the field, and then drive over it again to plant, then drive over it again to spray, then drive over it again to harvest.  Meanwhile there is no way to automate anything, you literally have to drive your tractor to the chicken yard then get out and run around picking up eggs.  OK there is one thing you can automate...a half ♥♥♥♥♥ worker to drive the harvester.  Did you want to sell  eggs?  well IF you can find the place to do it (since the ingame map barely functional) after you ran around like an idiot picking them up THEN you drive your tractor to that place and sell them.  Same silly plan with sheep and cows.  And crops for that matter.  There are ridiclous pop up missions that would be great if the game was called ""heavy equipment simulator"" where you drive your front end loader to pick up pallets.In short as a tractor driving simulation this is basicly ""OK"".  As a farm sim it is almost unplayable.			"

												OK... where to begin... Let's dive straight in, shall we?PROS:- It's cheap! Given there's a newer version out, this is a bargain. (Of course, why you'd even CONSIDER buying a new version is beyond me, once is truly, SURELY enough...)- It provides a very clear insight into the riveting, high octane world of farming!- lots of vehicles, accessories, things to load, unload, fill, plough etc (if that's your bag...)CONS:- I wanted to die while I played this...- It's a simulator about farming - and yep, you guessed it, it's 'somewhat' realistic. That means it's so frightfully boring and dull you'll have trouble stopping your brain from exploding.- There are in excess of 3000 people who own this game who gave it the thumbs up... Why is that a CON? Well... let's put it this way, the type of people who'd most likely give this a thumbs up probably like watching grass grow, and can't get enough of farming so they turn to a simulator to continue the experience into the evening. I'm shocked. Seriously I am.SUMMARY: It's not that the game is terrible. In fact, you could very reasonably argue that in playing a farming simulator, you need to set your expectations lower than a crack ho' turning tricks with Jack the Ripper. But here's the thing - even knowing it's a farming simulator, it still was so awfully dull, so painfully boring that I can't believe I played as long as I did.I mowed some grass at a golf course, I drove a tractor with a trailor perfectly lined up next to a harvester to catch wheat, then dumped said wheat in a grain silo, I took a load of peanuts to a place so they could attract a runaway elephant back (yep, you heard me right), i sold a tractor, I ploughed a field. Then I realised I was SPENDING MINUTES OF MY LIFE, JUST WASTING AWAY DOING THIS!!!!The tutorial was mildly amusing for 5 minutes, then the game just continues the awful, mind-sapping exercise. Oh man, how this game will sap your very soul!			"

												Yes, I have only played for 39 minutes so if you are seriously into this game (I'm not sure why you reading reviews to begin with) but this is not for you.  I could only deal with this game for that long.  I think it looks really fun, I love management games but actually plowing a field is not fun, frustrating and the controls are so hard on a computer.  This game is probably for more serious gamers then me but I regret paying for this.  I will probably try it again, because I paid for it but I would not recommend this for someone looking for a casual simulation game. "

												Aside from the brief moments where one of your vehicles crashes and does something absolutely hilarious, this game is not much fun at all.It's like working at a really horrible job, in a world that doesn't feel alive at all, and coming away from hours of effort only to have nothing to show for it. Not to say that you don't earn money in the game, only that the money, like everything else in the game, feels as fake as it is.If you're looking for a simulator that's more fun than this, and more productive, you're better off washing the dishes in your house and pretending you're playing Dish Washing Simulator 2014, only difference being that DW2014 can actually result in some form of benefit to your life.

												I must say I was rather disappointed with this title. This game is entirely about farming and literally nothing else. I thought this was going to be a more action-packed adventure, shoot em up type of game, but no. Only farming. I guess there was a plot twist I did NOT see coming though. SPOILER ALERT: Sometimes the virtual heavens open up rains. I’ve been through every kind of virtual rain there is. Little bitty stingin' rain... and big ol' fat rain. Rain that flew in sideways. And sometimes rain even seemed to come straight up from underneath. Shoot, it even rains at night... And the worst part is you can’t thresh in the rain I guess if that twist is taken into account, It is good enough to get. If ya like farming. And my guess is you do considering you went out of your way to search for a game that relates to farming and you are now reading a review about said game. A review that continues to waste your time but you can’t stop reading it. Perhaps this review will sway your opinion of the game. Perhaps you initially didn’t want to buy this game but now you're seriously considering buying this product. Perhaps you are mouthing your words as you read this. But in all honesty you should buy this so you can pretend farm like the rest of us.			"

												I first bought this game on a whim, immediately wondering how and why I could buy such a thing, and experienced buyer's remosrse before I even installed it. A farming game, really? The reality is, though, that this game is way more fun than it really has any right to be. I actually searched for a reason, and it occurred to me that every kid had a farm set growing up, and this is basically that on steroids. The game presents a good sized world that you can immerse yourself in pretty quickly.The gameplay is very well done, with integrated XBox 360 controller support that requires minimal tinkering. The tutorials are informative while remaining short enough to get you into gameplay quickly. The main thing I like about the gameplay, though, is unlike most simulators, the game's finance system gives me tangible goals that keep me playing. When I got out of the tutorial and started on my very first field, I was having a ton of fun with the different implements (again, this game is really just a toybox of large machines). But when I threshed, cultivated, and planted a new field, I was wondering what to do. Do I just sit there and literally watch the field grow? Thankfully, the game includes a mission system that keeps you busy between plantings, so you always have something to do.The other thing that really strikes me is the insane level of detail the game has. Animals in the game are rendered well, have fluid movement, and add a nice sense of atmosphere while being useful to core gameplay. The cars driving on the roads are surprisngly varied and have a level of detail they really didn't need for this kind of game, but it shows some level of commitment on the part of the devs. The people walking down the streets also are way more detailed than you'd expect from a simulator game that's mainly focused on the technical aspects of farming.This is a game I'd definitely recommend to others to check out, even if you're not a hardcore simulator enthusiast. It's very accessible and surpisingly fun to play.			"

												This game is crazy addictive. You start out with a small piece of land among a farming community with several pieces of land. You also start off with meager equipment, but as you begin to harvest and sell crops, you set your sights for bigger pieces of land, and better equipment, until one day you have all the land and all the tractors. The game also allows you to ""hire"" someone to do repetetive tasks, so you can focus on other parts of the game. I really love this game because it is really casual. I could throw on a movie and play this game, or watch tv while tending my farms. This game is perfect if you need some down time.			"

More fields, and more money.  There is a host of sites where you can go download more tractors, balers, and attachments.People have modded this to the point of being a real operation.You start off with 1 field and some equipment and you create an empire.

												Farming Simulator isn't just a simulator for farming. It's THE simulator for farming. I've spent nearly 30 hours, on a farming game. It's that addicting. My mind is simply numb from the hours spent behind the wheel of the many tractors i've bought, the golf course lawns i've mowed, and the pallet crates i've dropped off.This game isn't for anyone by any means. In fact, if you like fast-paced action, storylines, or engaging puzzles this game would definately not be for you. The game is better played with friends who would likely enjoy slow, time-consuming projects, and it just so happens there are few of us out there who are willing to enjoy that.Not recommended for everyone, but simulator fans are going to enjoy it.

												I must admit, im hooked!Yeah before you laugh, try it your self.Its a calm game, very detailed made and with great learning and fun along.When i startede playing it i was a bit skeptical, i mean it sounded a bit ""neerdy"" but i decided to try with a open mind. It was a bit difficult to begin with, learning what goes where etc but the internet and a google search machine you learn a lot.I found out it has some minor bugs, such as the other vehicles was stuck on my equipment like a fly on flypaper... but hey its minor...The details are quite impressive and i have noticed you can get quite a lot mods. I could imagine that multiplayer coop would be quite fun and a good challange.So yes, i would recommend this game :-)			"

												Wow i logged 197 hour on this game so far but like 150 of thoose hours were in the 1-3 months after i bought it. If you have a vauge understanding of farming plant seed fertilize and spray then harvest you will pick it up pretty quick. There is a little bit to be had with the few side missions and livestock management, play it on hard for the most fun. I would log more hours into it but it needs more to hold me in since i know all the effort that goes into farming. If the scale gets wayyyyy bigger I'm talking like just cause 2 size or bigger and some more north american brands of machiney and crop dusting to become a thing then the game would be awsome. Really good on multiplayer with a few friends.7.5/10 "

												Ok. Great Game, now to the boring part of my review.This game is pretty cool. It has all the aspects of modern-day farming in it. It also has some unrealistic aspects of it. Like, the crazy bikes mod, when u just tap something and you're in space. So many aspects that are amazing, and not graphically intensive at all.What I think should be improved with the game:• You should be able to change your Field of View, because there are some people out there who get sick because of it (me included)• VSync Toggle and Max Framerate selection• Nothing else. The game just needs these 3 things, and it is complete.Do I recommend this game? Depends on what you like, but it will have to be a big YES!!!			"

												Unlike real farming, where there's never not something to do, I can save this game and walk away.It's a fun simulation; I find myself looking into farm fields as I pass by them now, wondering what brand the tractors and harvesters are. The only thing that really holds this back is the complexity with which some things operate. It took a bit of poking around on Google to figure out how to feed cows, get manure, etc. But, overall, a great game!Also: Steam Cloud integration so I can play on my desktop at home, and sneak some play time in on my laptop at work.

												The game has its flaws. It is dated and there are some flaws. And its not that exciting of a game. But looking for a simulation that I wanted just for farming is one of the best ones I have tried. And if you look there are tons of mods that expand gameplay. Some things you are going to need a higher end computer, espicially if you add the forest mod, but there are always new things that can be done. But the base game is solid, and deliveries on a simulation about farming. No one ever said that farming as fun. If it was I promise you everyone would want to be a farmer.			"

												This is one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played. I don't think it will appeal much to those that like nothing better than hack and slash, but if you have a bit of patience to see your crop grow this is the game for you!There are a few minor comments to make, though. I might be a city gal, but I do know that chickens do NOT feed themselves, and that a henhouse needs a door so that the chickens can actually get in to lay their eggs and keep them safe against Mr Fox! I haven't bought any sheep or cows yet, but from the manual I get the impression that not much work, apart from making fodder, is expected there either. Also, I doubt whether even the most dedicated farmer can do without any sleep at all. Secondly, the world of Farming is a bit 'dead', In the town and on the campsite there are a few people shambling about, but that's about it. There's never anyone on the golfcourse, or in any of the other fields. And where are the birds? Where are the crows?On the good side nature, landscape, sky and weather patterns are a joy to see and watch. Machinery and crop are beyond perfect. So, all in all, 9 points out of 10, and highly recommended, nevertheless!			"

												I wish it had longer range anisotropy, but aside from that extremely minor issue, this game is fantastic. It really lets you feel like you're an actual farmer. The modding community is very active, so new playable maps, vehicles, placeable objects etc. get added very regularly. The only thing that stinks is that vanilla, it takes a while to get to the second combine. That can easily be fixed by adding more combines through the various modding websites available. 8/10, would harvest again			"

												In the dafault/vanilla portion of this game it can get really repetitive real fast. The maps are small when comparing it to other popular open world games and after a small amount of time both standard maps can get travelled real fast. It's not really a simulator at all, it's very arcadey. The Titanium Edition DLC offers a lot of high-detail models and new features which look amazing, but the eye candy loses it's charm after a short while. But what really makes this game is the mods. This game is 1000X better once you get into modding. The gameplay becomes more realistic as well as the machinery and maps. Downloading new texture packs for this game will really boost up the flair of how everything looks making it visually stunning if you download the right ones and put them together. The modding community for this series is very much alive and thriving even as far back as Farming Simulator 2009. Lots of great mods for tractors, combine harvesters, tools, implements, cars, trucks, etc are available. Without the modding component of this game, it would get old real fast, but I still can't stop playing this game with all the new free mods you can get and download that keeps this game fresh all the time. It has an extremely fair price and even comes with Giants Editor where you can make your own maps and machinery. A lot of skill is needed, but learning the basics is easy. I give the default/vanilla portion of this game a 6.5/10, but with the modding components, a 9/10.			"

												Such an action filled game. Never a moment of calmness; at the turn of every corner there's always a different seed, attachment, or whole vehicle to work with.Truly a masterpiece of a game. Never before have I been so entranced for so long. Even when you think you've done everything you still haven't bought all the vehicles and made the biggest mountain that you can attempt to climb.You heard me right, even when the planting is over you can still being a mountain climber; this game has no ends. Even when you're done climbing mountains there's always stunt jumps to be made or races to be won. You would think a game with such a calming name like ""Farming Simulator"" is nothing but tilling the soil, planting seeds, waiting for them to grow (for FOREVER!), harvesting them, and then selling them but you would be DEAD wrong! I am truly blessed to have stumbled upon this jewel of a game.If I had panties they would drop at the thought of playing Farming Simulator 2013. A must buy and a will love.

												If you like simulation games this is the game for you.If you like farming simluations this REALLY is the game for you.If you are a farmer and want to see how realistic this is, dont bother its not :-)My friends are laughing at me for likeing this game but...there is something about it.You sow, harvest, cultivate sow again, sell what you harvested, learn how to take care of the animals and make money from them all the while attempting to buy all fields and work them.....no small feat. Add on top of that the vast number of mods created by the community and it keeps you coming back everyday.check it out:examples:Modhub[www.modhub.us]http://www.ls2013.com/It certainly is not a deep game by any stretch of the imagination but for people that like sim games this is really really good :-)			"

												Don't let the metascore scare you away. This game isn't for everybody, but that doesn't mean it's a bad game. If you like relaxing, slow paced, and somewhat realistic simulators, give this one a look. There are over a hundred different vehichles, and tons of different features. It's also fully moddable, with a thriving modding community. It's bug free, and runs on relatively low end machines. Works on my four year old rig. 8.7/10. -Lewis			"

												fun sim game.  pretty basick once u get the gest of it. livestock funtions are very basic and could be better. Overall its well worth the price. lots of DLC availible. u can run quests, or just plant and sell if u want and make it. much faster to run quests but u can proceed either way. You can run it at the pace u want which is also nice.			"

												Words cannot describe how strangely addicting this game is. The satisfaction of having vast fields of finely organized crops and equipment just makes me feel great inside. There are some amazing mods out there, a lot of them providing assets to the game that once downloaded, I honestly could not see myself having the level of control I have in the game without them. I've poured so many hours into this game and it confuses and elates me as to why it's so satisfying being a farmer.Another thing, hiring workers is a very useful function in the game. It allows the game to feel more alive when you see other  AI making your farm look more like a functioning collective.			"

												My alltime favorite game. I have a mac and this runs fine on it with 100+ multi tool/vehicle mod packs which by the way are super easy to download. Fun to play realistic, easy, but challenging at the same time. Definitely worth a try. If you don't like it, and you have less than two hours on it and less than 14 days of ownership, you can refund and get all your money back. Just try it and you will be hook.I have 1,051.4 hours at my time of writing this, so I can say it is fun. Btw, the default vehicles and such are crap, mods definitely make it better. Especially the detailed ones like the ford forces, small farming pack, International Harvester 86 series pack, auto steer, hud hider, manual ignition, quick camera, and 956 moco pack.P.S  Notice how I write with perfect precision? Google docs rock! "

												There really are two ways to play farming simulator.One way is the right way.  Plant seed according to fluctuating market prices, wait a bit, harvest the plant and sell it.  Using the money you get, buy better tractors or implements.  If you want to add some more gameplay, download a mod off the workshop or online to get a new tractor or implement to buy.  Sounds boring, but can be rewarding and fun.The second way (my favorite) is the wrong way.  Download a whole bunch of mods (preferably infinite money and really fast cars) and mess around.  Get $50,000,000,000 and fill the entire map with windmills and watch as the civilians walk straight through everything.  Drive at 200 mph off a ramp and fly halfway across the map.Basically, Farming Simulator 2013 is just Do-Whatever-The-Heck-You-Want Simulator 2013.			"

												Pros:  Peaceful and satisfying way to ""earn"" a living.  I learned a ton about farming.  It's addictive and looks and sounds great.  Great mod community so you can get whatever equipment or buildings you want.  It never gets frantic or stressful--it's just one series of tasks over and over, and if done well really do allow you to grow and expand your farm.Cons:Interacting with NPCs and the economy leave a bit to be desired.  It isn't that realistic, and the ""missions"" are repetitive (although vital to generate cash early in the game).  The (environmental) people wander aimlessly and you can pass through them like ghosts, they're just there for show.  Minor quibbles:- Graphical the lighting source (moon, sun) not matching up with the ground shadows much of the time...they can be different by 90 degrees.  - The game, being made in Europe, favors European farm machinery.  There is no John Deere or pickup trucks, not even in the USA farm map.  However you can get this stuff from mod sites.			"

												Farming Simulator 2013 is one of the purest and most focused business simulations I’ve ever played. You own a farm in a country town, and your only goal is to grow crops to make as money without any “final objective” to chase. There are no scores, storylines, cosmetic money sinks (such as new player skins or houses), or other long-term goals. You simply choose a crop from four possible seeds to start your career, plant it in your field, harvest it, sell it and put that cash back into the farm. It’s almost impossible to damage your crops unless you’re not paying attention, so it’s difficult to fail or find yourself in a no-win situation.It's the best game you can play in co-op strategy			"

												This game is great. If you have the money and the love for farming, you should get this. The simulation is spot on. I feel like I am a real farmer. No more could be expected from this game. I mean, there are golf carts in it. What more could you ask for? This game is great farming by yourself but if you have another farmer, who doesn't want to compete with you, and join your forces to take over the town of Hagenstedt, then farming will be a breeze. This game is a definite 10/10.			"

												This game isn't good just for what you get with the game, but the tons of FREE community supported addons and mods outh there. IIf you buy the game and play it with out getting all the extra cool stuff it's quite stunted. Try googling ""Farming Simulator 2013 MOD"" look around at whats out there.			"
