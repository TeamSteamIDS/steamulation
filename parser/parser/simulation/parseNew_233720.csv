												Fun game, but ♥♥♥♥ that ambulance driver. I mean. COME THE ♥♥♥♥ ON. He cant drive that thing steady for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes? I have 2 major issues with that driver. One, I decided to wait until we got to the Hospital. The patient wasnt fatal and was stable. I WAITED 5 ♥♥♥♥ING HOURS, AND WE NEVER GOT THERE. Clearly he has no idea where he was going. He didnt even pull over to let me safely preform the operation. AND 2... While we were driving, the door randomly opened up. Me, wanting the upmost safty durring this operation, decieded that I should close it. It was at that moment that I realized that HE IS SWEARVING TO AVOID NOTHING. This means that my driver was ♥♥♥♥ING WASTED ON THE JOB. So other than a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ partner, good game.			"

												In Surgeon Simulator 2013 you control Nigel Burke, a guy who can't even tie his shoe laces without making ""finger spaghetti"" out of himself. Anyway, you control his fingers and thumb using the keyboard, which works well at simulating a hand. The controls can get a little frustrating, however I think that was a little on purpose. Now, most of you are all wondering the same question: Does it have a good story? Yes. It shows a man who poses a lack of hand motor skills and has a dream of becoming a surgeon, the best surgeon, but you are the only one who can fulfil his dream. The story and game play intertwine nicely and always makes you ask the same question: Was it worth it? As you stare down at the life insurance fee, was it worth it...? That aside, the game has three different types of surgery: Heart Transplant, Kidney Transplant and the Brain Transplant. They all are extremely fun and varied and include funny references, while you Tomahawk Chop someone in the skull. There is also a few secret levels, which I won't tell you about since they are...secret. Just go easy on the heavy (I've given my condolences to enough Team Fortress characters). In a nutshell, Surgeon Simulator controls well,  Has frustratingly-fun levels and even the starting menu provided for several minutes of fun. NOTE:  This is my first review, so I know it isn't that good, however I hope to get better as I write more.			"

												Most of us are well short of the level of education and subsequent anatomical knowledge required to successfully perform a heart transplant. Still, who wouldn't mind experiencing the awesome wave of heroic accomplishment that washes over a surgeon each time he or she saves a person's life? Surgeon Simulator 2013, a game from Bossa Studios, won't help you be a surgeon. It won't help you save lives, either. Hell, I'd even go as far as to say it has a negative influence on your personal knowledge of what invasive surgery actually entails. What it does do, almost in spite of itself, is haphazardly simulate the thrill of ripping a man's heart out of his chest and replacing it with another one.Surgeon Simulator 2013 replicates surgery the same way Enviro-Bear 2010 simulates a bear driving a car; with one hand and deliberately obtuse control. You play as Nigel Burke, or, more specifically, you play as Nigel Burke's left hand. Each of Nigel's fingers are controlled with your fingers on the A, W, E, and R keys, respectively, while Nigel's and your thumb is left to the space bar. Yes, that's completely insane, and yet also sort of logical position for your hand on a keyboard.Surgeon Simulator 2013's clumsy control is more of an endearing hook than a frustrating point of contention. It seems impossible, but, like rubbing your stomach and patting your head, an operational degree of control is gained with a bit of practice. Plopping Nigel’s hand down on a scalpel and watching him haphazardly pick it up like a cave man holding a pencil is both effectively hilarious and functionally acceptable. Hovering the hand over an artery and dropping it to replicate some sort of crude sawing motion looks absurd, but typically manages to get the job done. Playing Surgeon Simulator 2013 for a couple hours grants an almost expert level of control, but being a novice is almost more enjoyable simply because of how ridiculous everything appears when swinging Nigel’s dumb hand around the operating table.It helps that Surgeon Simulator 2013’s proposed method of surgery is almost completely unrealistic. Despite being mostly about goofs up to this point, there's a neat little game packed in Surgeon Simulator 2013. If you wreck Bob's guts too much he'll start bleeding, and if he bleeds out completely you'll murder the poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and fail the surgery.Spontaneity is perhaps Surgeon Simulator 2013's finest asset. Being physics-based game loaded with a ton of props, it's prone to numerous instances of accidental mishaps. Since Nigel's arms controls like your arm if it had been numb for three years, knocking all of the extraneous crap over on the operating table is a common occurrence. Likewise, accidentally dropping your scalpel, bone saw, or plastic spoon inside Bob's chest cavity is frequently unavoidable. From getting a scalpel lodged in your palm to accidentally administering hallucinogenic drugs on yourself, Surgeon Simulator 2013 is loaded with random and surprising tomfoolery.Obscene humor is the reason to play Surgeon Simulator 2013, and it delivers that asset in spades, but down the line it actually morphs into a legitimate challenge. After failing twenty or whatever times, I was sweating bullets the first time I managed to complete the kidney transplant. The sheer amount of things that could go wrong, not the mention the sloppy control, made for a true feeling of accomplishment upon completion. It's nothing like real surgery, obviously, but I did feel the overwhelming need to high five every one around and celebrate once I finally got it right.Half the fun is mentioning the premise of Surgeon Simulator 2013 to a buddy and then watching him or her come to grips with the outrageous task before them.And there you have it. Surgery Simulator 2013 is a joke, and its creators are well aware of that fact, but it’s effectively the best game about completing surgical procedures with a phantom limb ever made.			"

												The Three things I have learned from Surgeon Simulator:1) You are most likely not to get sued if you leave a scalpel in somebodies stomach at the end of a surgery.2) Ripping someone's heart out during surgery and slapping the patient's face with it is totally legal.3) Intestines make a great scarf.Conclusion: Why the hell not buy this game?

												Surgeon Simulator is ridiculously stupid yet somehow manages to be frustratingly fun. Your role is simple. Play doctor and transplant specific organs without letting your patient die. Sounds complicated right? Well the game severely dumbs down the process effectively letting you rip out anything you don't need to focus on the task at hand.Learning the controls is actually half of the fun. You only get one hand in the game, but you have to control that one hand with two hands of your own using both the keyboard and mouse. The mouse moves your wrist and arm and the keyboard grasps your fingers to grab tools and organs. It's quite tricky to get the hang of because it just feels so unnatural and it can be quite a challenge to hold tools at just the right angle to make that precision cut.Although the title may give a false sense that it showcases some realism, there is no doubt that Surgeon Simulator is designed for purely amusement purposes only. And it certainly excels in the amusement category. An extremely original concept plus very innovative gameplay make this a game worth trying at least once.			"

												A hyper-realistic surgical procedure simulation program, likely used the world over to train medical professionals.Playing this intense game, you get put second-by-second in total control of a mans life.The real world physics and photo-realistic graphics, combined with the Oculus Rift support makes this an unforgettable experience, almost identical to performing real open heart surgery yourself.As such, it is a very gory game and should not be attempted or even purchased by the weak of stomach or those with a tremorous disposition.It is also impossibly difficult, requiring a stready hand, a sweaty brow and utmost focus. Do NOT play if alone, under the age of 18 or have not had 3 years in medical school beforehand. Highly difficult, very realistic, outstandingly educational.I look forward to future productions from this outstanding simulation company.			"

												Surgeon Simulator is a first person QWOP game. You take the role of a surgeon named Nigel Burke. Mouse movements control your doctor’s hand, up, down, left, right, and rotating. A, W, E, R and space bar are all used to control individual fingers on the hand, this is used to grasp the utensils, The game play consists of the player trying to complete a number of different operations on your patient, the first being something as simple as a heart transplant. Once completing the first operations, you then unlock different scenarios, such as ambulance operations, ad space operations, which incorporate bumping round tools and zero gravity, The graphics are nicely presented and everything looks clean and polished, I don't think photo realism graphics would be something I would be looking for in this type of game anyway. The soundtrack is mainly the general hospital/emergency theme tune the whole time, I had to turn it off after the first hour or two as it just grew very repetitive very fast, all of the sound effects in game of the grinding, sawing and squelching are all very nicely produced. This game is hard, like, hard as nails hard, I am nowhere near completing it, and I have played for almost eleven hours, your hands start to ache if you play any more than an hour due to the intense holding down of the buttons and thought that goes into picking up a single item, it is unbelievable, I did try out using a controller using Pinnacle Gaming Profile (quick shout out to them while I am at it), and this did make the controls a little easier to use, but it was still stupidly difficult.I haven't found any technical issues, I would think a potato could run Surgeon Simulator; it's a well optimized game.A lot of the time I spent on this was playing with friends, just playing around seeing how messed up we could get, and that's what this game is all about, just having a laugh and giggle, it's hard to sit down on your own for hours at a time on this game just because of how strenuous it is on your hand and thought process just to pick something up. But I do recommend that people pick it up, just for the novelty value and for some couch gaming with friends.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Long spoken of as myth, fairy-tale or merely the raving delusions of a mad man, an ancient and mysterious evil has awoken and proven itself a very real and dangerous threat to all in the once pleasant land of Infirmary. But there is yet hope as a band of unlikely heroes unite to vanquish this foe and send it back to the vile domain from whence it came. Play the roles of plucky Pinkie, the young but eager son of a blacksmith, Ring, the exiled princess trying to win back her rightful place as heir to the throne, the short-tempered Middle with a past shrouded in secrecy and an apparent score to settle, Thumb, the stoic and noble paladin sworn to defend the realm, and their brave leader Index, who together form the brotherhood of The Hand of Nigel, as they set forth on adventure in a world filled with peril at every turn. Face hideous, demented foes throughout the course of your journey such as the snake-like Intesties, the oozing Liveros, and the worst villains of them all, The Board of Medical Examiners. Lay siege to their fortress of bones, but choose your weapons careful, as only the right tools will grant you access to their grotesque dungeons. Mere tiny blades and cutting devices will ne'er be enough to pass, but with steadfast determination and a mighty hammer you will see your way through to the inner sanctum. Once inside be prepared to face the horrible wretches that lie in wait for you, the bosses within the bowels of each twisted lair, including Master Pump, The♥♥♥♥♥♥taker, and the most sickening of them all... Big Brain. Only when these are vanquished will you truly be able to call yourself the Hero of Infirmary and claim the hand of the fair maiden Trisha. It is not a quest for those faint of heart or lacking in skill or valour, but great rewards await any warrior brave enough to take on this challenge as you traverse the wastelands, do battle astride the back of high speed carriages, and even magically voyage through the cold, dark void of outer space on your intrepid excursions. Find glory and pass into legend, or succumb to the forces of evil and meet your doom, but whatever you do, tread carefully lest you summon the wrath of the greatest danger of all, the all-knowing, omnipresent... Bob.			"

												Control mechanics might be tricky at first (Think Edward Scissorhands trying to stroke a Kitten), but with practice comes much blood loss and many near death experiences perfection.If you miss the manical laughter and sadistic 'oopsies' had in games like GTA when trying to be a do-good er but those crazy pedestrians just keep finding a way underneath your wheels, or walking into your fists whilst you're trying to make an honest living? Then this is probably up your street.Try your patience with juggling to keep your patient alive in between surgical shenanigans: don't fancy stabbing that eye to remove it for transplant? Perhaps spoon it out, or see if that ballpoint pen will suffice as a lever.Be the first of your friends to have successfully performed heart surgery in the back of a moving van and in zero-gravity on Extraterrestrial life. Don't worry about what your pals think, just imagine that priceless look from a potential new employer when you tell them of your field hours and lack of exponential experience!10/10 would skip med school to play this.

												I have no idea if you are going to like this game. It's a weird, hard to control, bizarre game. People compare it to QWOP and to the extent that it relies on playing twister with your fingers that's true, but it's much more than that. Each surgery is like a puzzle, trying to figure out which tools work and don't, finding the most efficient route through it. Achievements incentivize creative play. I mean, the most amazing thing about the game is that it exists at all, it's so absurd. But I think if you get past the initial curve you'll find a compelling score/time attack game.I'll also add that if you have people over to your house, non-gamers LOVE watching this. A casual hammer to the skull here, a drill dropped in a chest cavity there, accidentally throwing the replacement heart away. It's all good.You're looking at 8-10 hours for completion of every surgery with good scores, maybe 12-15 if you want to go to A++ on everything. The developers have also repeatedly updated the game with new free content, so I think it's fair to say that if you're the type that buys games to support a developer, this is a good choice.			"

												Maybe? I would ultimately say no. It is about manipulating a hand in minute detail using overly-specific controls. To wit: you can rotate your wrist, raise and lower the arm, and contract each finger separately. This hand of yours, you use it to manipulate objects in your environment to remove internal organs and replace them with new ones. In the process, hilarity ensues.There is nothing wrong with this, and I actually do think the emergent comedy of my in-game physical ineptitude is amusing, it's just not that fun to play. A lot of trial and error as I try to figure out which awkwardly held item is the best one to use to remove X-bit of anatomy, then awkwardly moving the arm around to get the correct grip on the tool, then awkwardly hacking out the bit. A lot of awkward manipulations going on, and at some point I'll mess up, or hack at the wrong thing while trying to hack at the right one, and the patient will bleed out, and I'll have to do it all over again. I can see someone having fun with all this. Unfortunately, I'm just not that person.			"

												The name should be «Mentally Handicapped Arm Simulator 2013». You control it via keyboard and mouse, rotating a hand, bending fingers and a wrist. In real life it takes a second to grab something, here it may take 30-60 seconds, in addition you may make a mess around. I laughed already at the main menu, which is part of the game, and I laughed out loud for the first 10 minutes of the surgery. Laughed like a kid. But then all the sandbox fun stops and you try to move on with the tasks. That's where it gets really annoying. It's both challenging and stupid, and I'm not eager for that kind of challenge. But I bet there's people out there who are. And you may be one of them.			"

												As an amateur home surgeon, performing surgery on myself and close relatives, I've always felt my field is given short shrift in the gaming diaspora. So naturally I was overjoyed when I discovered Surgeon Simulator 2013. Finally, an accurate portrayal of my day-to-day, and a chance to hone my skills. I used to be apprehensive about taking on those tricky triple heart bypasses in the zero gravity facility I maintain in my basement. But after just minutes with this highly realistic training tool, I feel like a veritable machine on the operating table! What's more, it turns out I didn't need my right arm anyway!It can get awfully dull down here. But now at least I've got the confidence to take my new-found expertise into the wider community, and it's all thanks to Surgeon Simulator 2013. Interested in the field? Don't waste time on worthless medical degrees or expensive bribes. Your one-stop solution is right here.			"

Posted: June 12, 2015
												Surgeon Simulator, if I were to sum it up, is 20 minutes of hilarious insanity, followed by a few hours of frustration, mixed with the occasional, satisfying, successful procedures.     Surgeon Simulator is packed with hilarious moments of utter chaos and insanity, such as performing dental surgery with a hatchet, bonesaw, and pencil, or trying to figure out the hilariously awkward controls to perform simple tasks like picking up your phone, or putting a floppy disk in a computer. You have probably seen all that on You Tube.But after about 20 minutes (varies from person to person), but the chaos gets old really quickly. And then comes the frustration.     You'll be trying to actually finish a surgery, only to be constantly pestered by your character's inability to perform simple tasks, such as picking up items, cramming his hand into tight places, putting more than 20 centimeters between his hand and the patient, inability to peek around his arm, and last but not least his spontanious fits of cerebral palsy.      Which is to say that sometimes your character will fail to pick up items despite his hand being straight on top of them when you flex the fingers, the reach of your arm is so short you cannot reach the farthest edges of the operating table, and in surgeries where the patient is upright, you can barely get your hand over your patient's head, making it nigh impossible to avoid smacking your patient in the face with whatever you're wielding. Besides that, your arm will almost constantly be blocking the view of either your tool or the organ you're trying to sever, and you will constantly drop things despite having a firm grip on them.     These arduous controls are what make the game fun for the first twenty minutes of intentional chaos and carnage, but are also what makes the rest of the game time horrible, and filled with unintentional chaos and carnage.     It does have plenty of good humor, though. I particullalartly liked the TF2 easter egg.I have decided not to recommend it, but this is only because I would not recommend it at its normal price. I bought it during a sale, and that is probably the primary reason I am not overly disappointed with the game.     If you like chaos and mayhem and randomness, then you'll probably have a good time. If you like to get stuff done, then this is really, really not the game for you.			"

												Beyond the absurdity and the humor, Surgeon Simulator can only offer frustration. Poor controls are taken as a core design philosophy and buttressed with any restrictive obstacle that came to mind. This is not the hilarious but humbling exercise of realizing how difficult complicated basic movement really is, this is a constant fight against a game that not only has to struggle to understand what the player wants it to do but also has trouble preventing objects from phasing in and out of each other. The lesson this game has to teach, what it demands of its players, is that they put aside the anger born of uncooperative controls to practice patience and precision in a world that has none. It's quite clever really. Shame all that's left to look back on is annoyance after annoyance, which increases level by level in the name of some sense of progression.			"

												Surgeon Simulator is an unrealistic and silly game. It has intentionally strange and difficult controls, which result in a very challenging and occasionally frustrating game. It's not a game I would recommend for people who will overreact and lose their temper. Some of the levels are just hard to control, or may even feel unfair. I do think that the game is the most fun to play with friends, and has the potential for a few ""funny moments."" I'd compare it to I Am Bread (same developer), or Octo-Dad: Dadliest Catch (I don't know the developer for that one.)Overall, I'd recommend getting the game on sale and then playing it as a party game. Save the challenges and achievements for yourself, if you're feeling determined.			"

												I played this game hoping to learn something about surgery. I started playing, had myself having difficulties with controlling the left hand and found out that I won't really learn much about this field.I went on playing for a few more hours for some days and I enjoyed having control over Nigel's left hand. There are a lot of stupid things that you can do with the patient and I found both playing around with the patient and completing each of the surgical operations really enjoyable.Barnardshire had a couple of surgery options available. Unfortunately Bob had a lot of ailments which left him no choice but to have heart, kidney, and brain transplant. As Nigel, you'll have to do all the operations in different environments. As you go on and become more dexterous you can make Nigel become practically licensed. I had the most difficulty getting A++ doing the brain transplant inside an ambulance, paying attention to what happens in the environment can really help in making Nigel the best surgeon in the world. If you work hard you can even do your surgical maneuvers in outer space, who knows what may happen when things float all over the place?I am almost done with what the base game offers and I am looking forward to getting the Anniversary Edition Content for the eye & teeth operations plus the corridor environment.

												Intro:I feel that the main goal of Bossa Studios for the original game, was to get a quick laugh from the audience and maybe make some money off of it, I feel the same for this version. Ask anybody that owns it about why they bought the game and they will most likley say ""Because it looked funny"". I think the only reason you would buy this game is due to the fact that it looked freaking hillarious to see a scalpel jammed into some poor man's eye. I mean, who really want's to buy this for the pure challenge of preforming sugery on a patient? I would assume you want to buy this as an escape from the daily life, to the inner realms of video games where everything that happens is supposed to be a fun experience, and I think it does this fairly well.Gameplay:I think that the gameplay is pretty hard, and the fact that it is hard is just the point of the game. The devs as gamers thought about the most annoying things you could implement, and afterward implemented them. I think that the devs never expected this to be a really good game that people played and speedran just due to the fact that it was only intended as a quick laugh and nothing more. When it comes to the Pros and the Cons of the game I don't like adressing them just due to the fact that as previously stated, the cons were intended for the end product long before the release of the game. I can't judge the gameplay of this as it really depends on your sense of humor and expectations of what a game should be.Conclusion:Since this game was mainly to make a funny statement about something, I don't feel like you should even consider playing it like a real video game, but to play it as a form of comedy that you may come back to after a hard day of work. To actually play it as a fully fledged video game is just foolhardy, and if you want a FAIR challenging experience, I wouldn't really recommend it in any way shape or form. 100%ing this thing was really pointless in the whole scheme of things, and in all honesty it ruined the experience of ever playing a game like it again. I think if it's on sale (which it usally is) go for it, there is no crime in laughing at a fake man's misery, or doing psychologically questionable things to his organs, however, I urge you to never ever play it like a real game, but to only ever play it as a silly satire on the ""Simulation"" genre of today...Side Note: If I could give this a ""Mixed"" or ""So-So"" review I would use that instead, but alas I am stuck with the current steam system of reviewing something.

It has more moral choices than the big guns like Mass Effect and Heavy Rain - do you try to make this guy live, or see how quickly you can kill him? The decision is yours, but lives are at stake.In just 30 short minutes, I managed to perform an open heart surgery. It only took the deaths of three or four previous patients to reach this goal. I have now realized my true calling in life is to enter the medical world. Hope you guys all have fun with this game, I'm off to practice my left-handed surgery on sick orphans. The real deal.			"

												Have you ever wanted to save lives?Have you ever wanted to prove the the world you are sane?Have you ever wanted to learn how to correctly perform surgery?This game satisfies none of that.Have you ever wanted to put someone's life into your shaky hands, only for them to die on you?Have you ever wanted to *practice* advanced medical procedures?Have you ever wanted to  perform surgery in an ambulance with a driver that moves left and right very suddenly despite the fact there are no cars around him whatsoever which causes the back door to open which causes the transplant organ(s) to fly out the back, preventing you from completing the operation? If so, you should buy this game. Difficult, yes. Rage-inducing, yes. Fun, yes.			"

It's a MASTERPIECE  --  for an indie or simulation game!Cool GAMEPLAY for an indie game ==> (9/10)You'll simulate a surgery with one hand only, and there's no clue about how to do the surgery effectively before you finish the surgery. It's kind of gore because you can use the tools to kill the patients instead of help them. But, it's fun! *HAHA (laugh as KIRA)*Nice GRAPHICS for a simulation game  ==> (10/10)Some other indie-simulation games had a really, really, bad graphics. Seriously! *cry in bear simulator* But this one had a quite good graphics, and it runs perfectly on my potato PC (a 1.9 GHz processor and NVIDIA GeForce 820m with memory of 2GB RAM).Finally, I highly recommend you to play this game. Because overall, I would rate it 9.5/10 if being compared with other simulation games. And 8/10 if being compared with other games in general.			"

												I would recommend this game only if you have the 'PATIENTS' to deal with the lousy control game play.Was included in a  Humble Bundle deal  as bonus game making it a sweet deal .The first day playing I was ready to destroy my mouse and keyboard.Once I got the hang of the contorls I took off on it completing far more achievements then I expected. Will test and challenge you in many ways with various tools and 4 different surgeon modes  .The ambulance and space modes are a must try and a great test of your patients both for you and Bob!			"

												""HURP DE DURR IMMA BAD SURGEON!!1"" the crowing of YouTubers continues.  You wanna know why this game is so popular?  It's because of all those Million+ viewed videos of people screaming in frustration as they try to hack past a sternum and kill their patients.  It's another game like 'I Wanna Be The Guy', but the controls are purposefully horrible instead of being purposefully designed to kill you every second.This isn't a game you play for good fun or trying to be a real surgeon.  Surgeon Simulator 2013 is a joke app made by a bunch of chuckle ♥♥♥♥s in a very short time and is kind of a hollow gimmick once you get past the awful controls.The hand has a VERY limited range of motion, it can't turn any objects to any kind of natural position for precision, it's sluggish like you're moving through molasses, the hand lags a half second behind the mouse, and it's incredibly hard to grasp anything in your fingers without stuff flying all over the place and putting them in a worse position or out of reach.  (My arm actually started getting tired from trying to meanuever the mouse so much.)  This thing will be what you will control the entire game with from the Menu screen to the dozen or so surgeries you'll have.You also have to do it under a time limit as the more you cut and crush drains your patient of blood and you'll very soon have a countdown timer (blood loss) till the patient dies.  Get ready to start pulling your hair out as this exercise in frustration will leave you cursing at the screen for a long time like why the god damned hand doesn't grasp anything properly.I recommend looking through the Diskettes on the main menu that you can pop into the Commodore computer.  They show you shortcuts on how to more effectively cut the tiny arteries, scooping intestines, etc.There's not much content outside of the bare stages where instruments are strewn about.  You're a single surgeon inside an operating chamber and you have to perform a transplant of some kind in several different environments.  Heart, kidneys, and brains in a surgeon's ward, ambulance, and space.  There's a Team Fortress 2 level that's ripped from the Meet The Medic trailer and an alien autopsy.  That's it.  There's nothing else to do except try to go for a highscore, but it's worthless.  Once you're done, you'll probably want to quit the game and uninstall it.I get the ""joke"" of what this game is.  It's like a trainwreck made of organs and flying utensils, but the controls aren't worth it.  Avoid this crap.			"

												A fun, interesting and challenging game designed to promote anger management classes. Unique gameplay, with comical surgical procedures designed to test the intentional awkward controls to its max. Challenging achievements keeps you hooked and red in the face. Normally i'm very anger free during gaming, but this one really tested my patience. The anniversary additions adds extra challenges with the frustrating corridor scenario, as well as new eye and tooth transplant surgeries.CAUTION: High risk of inducing bouts of shouting and swearing. May results in damaged table, screen, keyboard and mouse.Pros:+ Unique and awkward controls+ Can either choose to be left or right handed+ Challenging achievements for those dedicated gamers+ Hilarious surgical proceduresCons:- Can be frustrating...to say the least- Awkward controls- Does not help to relieve stress after workMy Score: 8/10			"

												I, at one time, might have discounted or otherwise insulted this game for being gimmicky and ironic, in private, to as many people as I could rant to.  Do not vote for this game, I said, for it is just monkey cheese nonsense being sold to dumb internet people.  But somewhere between not enjoying the demo and receiving the full version, this game grabbed me between it's shaky noodly fingers.  Between the awkward controls and the wonky physics is a game that actually works under it's own weird set of rules.  Sure you might drop a fresh organ or two on the floor, or lose a couple out of the back of a moving ambulance, and oftentimes it won't be your fault, but at the same time you'll likely just nod your head and realize that it's just another facet of the game and reload, ready and eager to take another crack at Bob's insides (was that one entire sentence?)Point being, this game is a celebration of the human condition, and a real testament to courage and the power to overcome obstacles that seem impossible.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll make your janitorial staff quit out of protest, but most importantly you'll learn to love and live.  And harvest organs.			"

												Surgeon Simulator 2013 is a surgical simulation game.The controls are suitable rudimentary. You use three keys to flex your fingers, and spacebar for the thumb. Left click can be used to move the arm up and down, while holding down the right button controls the rotations. There are items which, when you grasp near them, sort of “stick” to your fingers.The amount of content in the game is a little sparse, you can finish everything it has to offer in a couple hours. There are 3 main procedures, 3 variants to these operations, and 2 extra missions. After you have completed all of these there is only the fun of goofing around with the game to add to play time.There are also several bugs, like the hand got stuck in the table and you have to restart the operation. Sometimes the syringe does not work. Also a frustrating thing is that if an item falls a little too far on the table, you have to restart, because you can not reach it anymore.Surgeon Simulator 2013 is not a brilliant game, but a brilliant joke, in the form of a game.Sounds 5/10Graphics 5/10Gameplay 4/10Atmosphere 6/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												You play as a butcher who pretends to be a surgeon, but not an ordinary surgeon, it's a surgeon that has only one hand, wears no gloves and has the manual dexterity of a 3 year old kid!PROS:- You may learn something about the position of your guts;- You'll have an idea about how it feels to control a mechanical hand, like those used by people who had an amputed arm. But worse;- You may fulfill your sadistic instincts by killing your patients with surgical tools;- You may hit yourself with your own anesthesia syringe, which will make your vision psychodelic.CONS:- Controls are awful, VERY awful. Five keys on the keyboard control the closing of your fingers and the mouse will control the movement of your hand, just like a remote-controlled robotic hand would be;- There's no automatic adjustment of the objects to your hand, which means that you'll pick up objects any way you can, they will never be in the right position and will easily fall from your hand, again similar to a mechanical hand;- Your arm is always in the same horizontal position and will get in the way often;- If you drop something on the far corner of the table or let it fall to the ground you can't reach it anymore, it's lost forever;- It's too difficult to succeed, but possible if you try very, very hard and have a lot of patience (I don't);- Your patients are completely sedated and won't react to your sadism in case you like this kind of thing;- Your patients basically die by blood loss (there's a blood counter measuring how near it is to death), so whatever you do will have the same effect. The only difference is the speed of bleeding.CONCLUSION:Initiallly fun because of the absurdities, but infuriating thereafter. I can't recommend.			"

												6.2/10 - The hardest game on the planet!Props for being so hard; everything looks easy to do but execution will make you pull out your hair and rage quit. I've accepted I will never complete a surgery, now I'm just looking to complete any achievements and get those drops!Only play this if you enjoy a true challenge, you will use both hands to hold, grasp and perform difficult maneuvers. You won't breeze through this one. I think the $13 price is much too high. I bought on sale for $1.39, so look for sales.Worth $5!

												Umm, so I have had this game for a few years and haven't played it much. You probably know a bunch of people on youtube who have played it in the past and have gotten mad with the difficult controls, and even if it's the real deal I find that I as well can't even play for 20 seconds without losing my mind. It controls bad (on purpose) and even if you complete the level and for example put the new heart in, it glitches out somethimes for me and the level never ends... you just sit there and do nothing. I have nothing against the people who made the game but I just don't like the game/controls. If you like the game that's fine but I would not have bought it if I would have known any better.			"

												7th of February 2016:To everyone who worked on this game: nice try, but go ♥♥♥♥ yourself with a car, die a horrible and painful death and rot in a sewer. Why?First have a look at this video: 


YouTube™ Video: Surgeon Simulator in a nutshell 

			Views: 1,190		

			Sorry for the beeping sound, had my mic still enabled and it kinda does that... So anyway, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥how buggy and annoying a game can be, especially when going for the achievements!		

Next, let me explain some of the things about this game:1) Glitchy collision models. Your hand and instruments will always keep getting clipped inside something or something gets stuck inside your hand or between your fingers. VERY frustrating when going for the challenges/achievements.2) Operations are 50% luck when it comes to finding the right spot where to cut. You can easily spend several minutes trying to find the spot you need to cut to proceed. Most frustrating being the eye transplants, where you need to stab Bob in both eyes with a scapel for example, but good ♥♥♥♥ing luck trying to get it in the eye, since it's apparently random when it decides to go in. The angle, force, position of the eye, NOTHING like that matters. The scapel goes in when it wants because ♥♥♥♥ the player. And don't even get me started with the Corridor -operations, where the RNG decides what you get next as random trolleys pass by, which BTW do NOT respawn the instruments that have fallen off. Good luck if they spawn clipping inside eachother and thus just exploding everywhere!3) Speaking operations and challenges, how can the Hell can you still have a game with such glitchy achievements? 180 spoon flip? Nah, barely 20 degrees did it for me. And don't even get me started on the achievements that fail to realize that you've completed them. And the biggest insult in challenges: ""I can see miles... per hour."" First the description: ""Complete the eye transplant in an ambulance in 1 minute and 60 seconds."" What the ♥♥♥♥ even is that? Did the devs REALLY fail with even a simple task of writing a DESCRIPTION?! If they can ♥♥♥♥ up even a simple description then how can they program the challenges, let alone an entire game properly?!I could go on with the flaws this game has, but I don't think the devs deserve the feedback.I will complete this game to show that I did manage to beat this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ but NEVER expect me to buy a single game from Bossa Studios EVER AGAIN!YOU WILL NOT DEFEAT ME WITH YOUR LACKING PROGRAMMING!EDIT----------9th of February 2016:Came back to tell you that I have now reached 100% completion of this pile of junk. And let me tell you people, the inaccuracies are everywhere, especially in the Alien Operations! I also realized how much this game relied on YouTubers by adding achievements and alien organs after them. Yeah nice marketing trick you got there: make an organ or achievement after a YouTuber to have them play the game and get free advertisement.But let me tell you people, the amount of relief when I saw the last achievemnt pop up and then hitting ""Delete Local Content"" was much better than actually playing this game.Tata and good ♥♥♥♥ing riddanceEDIT----------4th of July 2016:I came back to write some more after you filthy ""FUNNY"" developers decided to add more achievements to this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥excuse for a functioning game.You did it again. You ♥♥♥♥S did it AGAIN! You added some ""FUNNY"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t but you couldn't have been bothered to test it to make sure that works properly!You people STILL haven't fixed ANY of the issues, you've only added some! Look at the ""Small Loan From My Father"" -achievement. $1M in a medical bill? Okay, seems easy enough, right? ♥♥♥♥ YOU! What you need to do to get this achievement is to basically use a glitched and inconsistent mechanic because you CANNOT do this legitimately! I even red some forum threads that this is a bug. Okay, so you're working on it? How the ♥♥♥♥ is it taking a MONTH already to fix it?!♥♥♥♥ you then, I will play your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ piece of cancer of a game to get back the 100% completion.You are all a bunch of filthy and pathetic excuses for game developers.EDIT----------14th of August 2016:IN! YOUR! ♥♥♥♥ING! FACE!It took me a month to get the Small Loan achievement but I DID get it and now I'm back to 100% completion!And what REALLY shined through that time was the amount of♥♥♥♥♥♥Bossa passes through. The idea of the achievement isn't that bad, but when you basically have to glitch your way to the achievement because you CAN'T do it what feels like a sensible way. Because apparently SOMEONE at Bossa thought that it was a good idea to give more money for the hospital bill the harder you hit Trump, while it's already very easy to glitch your tools inside the models. No, not just loodging your tools in the ribcage, I'm talking about an AXE getting stuck INSIDE Trump's face  when you try piling up some more money.But still, once again, I have BEATEN your ""game"" and I am DONE with this♥♥♥♥♥♥ AGAIN.""Delete Local Content?"" Yes please.			"

												Instruction manual to successful surgery:1) Stab the patient in his throat to prevent him from breathing. Breathing can cause issues with surgery.2) Reach your hand inside his chest and yank his heart out.3) Since their is no buget to replace it with a new one, insert a soda can.4) If the surgery still doesn't say ""success,"" it is glitching. Stab the patient in the chest with your drill to get it running smoothly again.After these steps, you should have completed a successful surgery.			"

												I can deal with the controls.My problem with this game comes from the lack of instructive feedback and repetitive music.It would be helpful if this game had some indicators on which part of the organ needs to be cut and why certain organs need to be cut while others can be torn out. Without any feedback, I can just flail with a scalpel until something loosens or the patient dies.			"

												Fun game, but unless you have the correct keyboard, you basically cant play. I even bought a more expensive keyboard to try to get it to work and i had to adjust the key mapping and have to spread my fingers out so far it starts to hurt after a couple of minutes. No controller support, which is odd bc i beleive this game is on playstation as well. So it seems like controller support could be added rather easily. but what do i know haha. Anyway, i have since found a list of keyboards that supposedly work perfectly. Just would have been nice to know the game required a top level keyboard to play before i bought it.			"

												My patient, Bob, said he swallowed some food colouring, I guess that by then he'd DYED a little. I then tried to save him with an I.V but it was all in vein. Then we needed to perform brain surgery - but Bob said he wouldn't give us a piece of his mind. Then we became heart to heart. I then had a flashback - I remembered my Surgery exams - I made the cut. But I killed Bob. And it's all ogre now.			"

												I bought this game on a steam discounts, at autumn. And it was my first simulator I've ever played.For the first time, this game doesn't look like something big. It was older versions of surgeries with a small amount of operations. So I played a bit, and forgot about it. But then DLC comes out, I found, what the game got a big overhaul, and since I want to get 100% achievements in a game, I guess I should give it a try, and wasn't dissapointed.What can I say something else? Well, about some parts, like graphics or stuff. Graphics are good, physical part is fine (but sometimes physics are testing your patience), music is amazing. Something bad about this game? Well, if you are going to achieve 100%, this will gonna test your nerves so badly, because you need to be fast with a bit bad controls. Speaking of controls, you can't play this game for too long, because with default controls, you hand will be tired in 30 mins. I recommend you do some break after some surgeries. Well, I have nothing to say anything more.I definitelty recommend this game, if you want a simulator, what gives you a challenge. And also, to have a full experience of this game, grab a DLC.P.S Sorry, if I messed up, somewhere, with English.			"

												Surgeon Simulator has given me the confidence that if I ever suffer a serious stroke, I can make a full recovery and become a surgeon after all my trauma.They should honestly make people going through physical therapy play this game, I have the full use of my hands and I still butchered patients at first, but after some time and practice, I was getting A++ ratings on every surgery I did, I even got abducted by aliens and fixed ol' ET right up, but I wouldn't mention that on my resume.While real life surgery might be a bit more complex, I truly feel like this game has prepared me for an emergency roadside operation if it ever has to come to that.

												This game is awesome. The charm is in the terrible controls, which are totally masterable. At first you'll be clunking around, ripping out organs and flinging tools across the room to hilarious effect, but as you get used to it you end up becoming, well, surgical with the horrible controls. I spent 14 hours getting all the silly achievements mostly because they were fun to do. If I had a Razer Hydra or an Oculus Rift, I'd probably jump back in the game just to try it since it's always enjoyable*.*Some patience and a sense of humor are not included with the purchase, which are required to enjoy this game.

The physics are fun to play around with as well as the controls and the patient's face, but it will get boring very quickly.TL:DRYou'll only play for a max of 5hrs and never touch it again.

I have never played a simulation game that perfectly gives you an experience of being a surgeon. I operated exactly like the in-game doctor, and that's why I lost everything. My wife doesn't talk to me, my kids pretend like I don't exist, and I wasted 7 years of my life in med school, only to lose my job as well. At least I still have Surgeon Simulator 2013.			"

												This game has alot it can teach you. I learned real fast that I should never be a doctor, but I have a blast just reaching in there and ripping the lungs out or taking the hammer to remove the rib cage....needless to say the game is only as twisted as the player is.The great part of this game is that you will find yourself constantly going back to play it in the future. Or to show friends and family why you did not persue the medical field.			"

												Silly, silly, silly. This game is an incredible amount of fun, though if you're squeamish at the prospect of flying digital guts and blood...well why are you looking at this game?But in all seriousness, the style is smooth and visually grabbing, the controls only mildly frustrating when you're on a time crunch (Use two hands, Nigel!), and the enjoyment factor is up to extremely satisfying. My favorite bit is that it even includes a side mission related to my favorite game Team Fortress 2, which if you haven't played, do. The menu is also them most uniquely extensive I've seen, and so much fun to interact with. Warning: You may become so distracted you forget there's an actual game attached.The only time Surgeon Simulator has frustrated me was when I was going for a couple of especially difficult achievements, but even then I still liked it. I mention this because if you have patience issues, you may find less enjoyment in it than I did, but I'd still urge anyone to try this game.			"

So there's potential for a lot of gameplay. Especially if you want a laugh - just seeing what happens when you do different things...I'd recommend for anybody with a sense of humor. Can't really flaw this game it's very well polished and finished. Good value even if it's not on sale.			"

												I definitely recommend this game. It's a creative mix of artstyle and cartoony fun, with an amount of education on human anatomy tossed in. It's hours of entertainment, because the game isn't meant to be played seriously. Nobody stresses themselves to be A+ grade surgeons and get the best times. People play this for the limitless ways you can either succeed or fail the ridiculous surgeries! To conclude, you seriously need to check this game out.			"

A great ‘simulation’ game where a convenient hammer is always lying around and you can tear out every organ in the body and the patient is somehow miraculously alive. At first the controls are a bit hard to grasp but with a little practice you will be up and preforming heart transplants within minutes.

												This is fun, and very challenging game. However, don't be fooled by the word 'Simulator' in the title. This game 'simulates' surgery in much the same way that the old board game 'Operation' does. You play the game by manipulating a single hand, and then using tools laid out around you to do the operations. Controlling the hand is difficult at first, but you get accustomed to it with time.If you ever wanted to attempt a brain transplant in the back of a moving ambulance, play this.			"

Such as, hammers, saws, knives, etc. You can basically beat the crap into Bob for fun and achievements.The first level area is in a basic surgery room, with the heart transplant, kidney transplant and brain transplant. The second level area is in a moving ambulance (VERY FRUSTRATING) you have the same procedures as level one.The third level area is SO DAMN FRUSTRATING. You are in SPACE in a low earth orbit (LEO) with floating tools.The last level area is operating on an alien in an unknown region of space. It is entertaining. I recommend this game.			"

												Did you also dream of becoming a doctor when you were little? well have i got the game for you. Surgeon Simulator 2013 is the hyper realistic simulation of one-handed not-quite-a-doctor dude trying to save Bob's life who somehow can survive with a radio as a heart, but thats beyond my concern.

												Surgeon Simulator's controls are strange, but they are the best that a game like it can have using a keyboard and mouse. It takes a while to get used to and is sometimes quite frusterating, but it is very fun. This is not the best game you can get for $10, but it is a good game. It is quite challenging and of a very unique genera.			"

												THIS GAME IS SO DAMN FRUSTRATING!I love this funny, surgeon simulation game. You have a patient to operate on named, 'Bob', with 5600ml of blood, and you have a series of tools. Such as, hammers, saws, knives, etc. You can basically beat the crap into Bob for fun and achievements.The first level area is in a basic surgery room, with the heart transplant, kidney transplant and brain transplant. The second level area is in a moving ambulance (VERY FRUSTRATING) you have the same procedures as level one.The third level area is SO DAMN FRUSTRATING. You are in SPACE in a low earth orbit (LEO) with floating tools.The last level area is operating on an alien in an unknown region of space. It is entertaining. I recommend this game.			"

The ambulance levels become very difficult as if it wasn't hard enough already. Great little game for the sale cost it was. Good laugh for all. Also a great game to make funny clips for a YouTube video, or a good laugh on a live stream. Hopefully with next year's version they have some decent upgrades. Often times I find myself frustrated unable to grab certain things at certain angles. But overall, I definitely recommened the game to others to try out.8/10			"

												Surgeon simulator is more of a funn beat the clock game then it is a surgeon game.You are using some weird tools / special tools  to for an example give somone a new kidney or a new heart! The game gets harder and harder by each level, and I really recommend the game IF you are playing it with a friend or somone you like. There is some glitches and glitch objects, like the little towel thing( sometimes it gets stuck in Bob).- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Id r8 88/88 becouse its gr8 (no b8, no h8 ) "

Product received for free
Will It Run?I have only ever written a review for Steam games that are exceptionally easy to run on almost any computer. As for myself I can hardly run Minecraft but I have no problem running Surgeon Simulator. Even on max quality settings Learning CurveGame just comes with practice but then again it isn't skill based at all. I would compare it to a standard phone game it only gets easier by playing over, and over again.About The GameIn case you haven't noticed from the game trailer or a video of this games gameplay. It's not anywhere close to being a Surgeon Simulator. In this game, you have to grab any object around you that looks decently sharp and attempt to tear and rip out your patience organs until you have reached whichever organ you are preforming a transplant on. At that point, if it were a heart transplant for example. You would have to rip out the heart and simply drop a new clean healthy one in its place. Not saying this game is bad but I to clarify for the few people who think its an actual surgeon simulation. "

												Hilarious and Fun!The best way to describe this game.The greatest streght of this game, just like ""Goat Simulator"" is that it goes beyond the initial ""Laugh -Spoof Factor"" and actually offers a challenging and intense game.Surgeon Simulator puts you in the hand (literally) of a surgeon, ready to operate some rather unlucky patients.The operations are rather absurd (like brain transplants and such) and the intentionally ""random"" physics make everything so much fun to play!If you want to you can ignore the mission goals to ""annoy"" (or brutally murder) your patient and the tools you use to ""operate"" surely are inappropriate...Saws, Lasers, Hammers ecc...it's pure madness.Highly recommended game.Pros:- Fun to play- Hilarious- Many collateral activities (starting from the menu itself)- Many easter eggs and secrets- Challenging (in a good way)- Fun to play even when creating a senseless mess.Cons:- Only 3 types of operations (remixed in very different ways, though)To Keep in Mind:- The controls are very hard to get used to and disorienting, for the first hour...but after a while you grow accustomed to them and actually appreciate how they work.

												If I could have any profession, ignoring all college costs and other ties, I would want to be a trauma surgeon. This is as close as I'm getting. And sure it's not exactly how surgeory is, like you don't use a ball pein hammer to knock teeth out! You use a claw hammer, we all know that. But it still makes you feel the power a surgeon must feel, performing on this obviously sick Bob, who's in for every operation known to man. Seriously, if you need a new heart, kidney, brain, and eyes then you should probably just pull the plug.This game is tough to play if you have a laptop, so make sure you have a mouse too if you plan on buying.

												A very difficult but fun and unique game that requires you to be calm and collected, especially when well.. you get high. You have to learn to be precise in controlling your virtual hand to for instance poke out eyeballs with pencils or place kidneys in their specific gaps (worst thing in the world). Alternatively you can bash your patient's head with fire extinguishers and electrocute yourself. This game is filled with dozens of tiny secrets and unfortunetly if you want a 100% achievement completion, you will have to look things up. This game isn't perfect, there aren't many levels - only 5 basic types of surgeries in a couple of settings. I hope in the future some DLCs will be released. I recommend purchasing this game when it's on a sale.			"

												Truly, a real indie game.This game lets you be a doctor, yes, a ♥♥♥♥ing doctor, without needing to study.You can maul your patient or you can heal him, both options are funny and cool as well.The game includes secret areas, secret pacients, different kind of surgeries in more than 4 different places.About the gameplay, basically you're a hand, your job is to move this hand and TRY to manipulate the tools to perform the surgery (or not). When you press the keys you really think that you're, in fact, the hand that performs the surgery. The funniest part of the game is trying to use the tools, maybe if you watch a gameplay You will probably say: ""Seems easy, I don't know how this idiot can't use a drill"", well It is not so easy as it looks.The idea of the game is not ""have a good game story"", It would be most like: ""There you have, a human being, kill or try to heal him, good luck"".It combines a hilarious theme and the seriousness of a surgery, having as a result this masterpiece. That's what makes this game one of the best inde games that I've ever played.9/10			"

												Got this in a Humble Indie Pack.One wonders... can anyone be dissapointed by a $1 game?Surgeon Simulator has the dubious honour of answering that with ""yes""... a feat previously unthinkable. Stick to the Youtube vids... they can be somewhat enjoyable, unlike the game itself.			"

												If you happen to have an operation scheduled for the near future, then playing Surgeon Simulator will be like watching Final Destination prior to boarding a plane. If, like me,  your operation was 7 years ago, then you will be left with the unsettling idea that there may be a wristwatch lodged in your ribcage.Infuriating but good fun.			"

												You buy it, play it once, have a lot of fun, and then never play it again. This game just sits in my library, gathering dust, yearning for me to play it, but I never do. And I never want to. This was absolutely a waste of money, and it's money that I can't get back because I spent more than 2 hours playing it the first time. Now it sits there and stares at me, making me regret buying it everytime I pass it when I scroll through my games.			"

												This is game is one of the best dark humor games. It also has plenty of content (which takes forever to finish) and tons easter eggs. You get to do whatever you can't do in an actual surgery, whether its drilling a hole into your patient's skull, blowing up baboon hearts, or slapping him with his own intestines.

												Do not buy this game. I'm still stuck on the first task: controlling the damn thing. Before I'm told to get better at it, let me say this. This game is very similar to QWOP, as in the controls are meant to be very difficult and the game is not meant to be taken seriously. However, QWOP is free. This is $9.99. I bought Bastion, one of the best games ever made, in sale for about $2.00 (I can't remember the exact price. Sue me). Speaking of the controls, the difficulty here is more artificial than anything else. Let's compare this difficulty to another difficult game- Super Meat Boy. I think JonTron says it best: ""[It's] ball-renchingly difficult, but you know what? The controls are so tight that if you mess up, it's entirely on you, and that feels good. It's great. Difficulty isn't the problem. Cheapness is."" Say you're doing the heart transplant and the heart gets stuck in the ribcage. Cheapness. That's one word that actually sums this game up pretty well. Except for the price tag compared to the quality of the game.			"

I was aware that it's hard and annoying, but I decided to buy it and give it a try. If it's about me, it was funny in the beginning, several minutes of the beginning. Later it begun to be frustrating and completely not entertaining. I know it is to be like that, but I wish there were some difficulty levels. Anyway, I was not entertained by this one.			"

												Quite possibly the best simulation there is, cause its nothing like being a real surgeon! You can shove all sorts of thing in a human body apparently, and then make the real procedure. If you can with a hand, which has the hangover of year, and is controlled by total♥♥♥♥♥♥ Nonetheless it is very entertaining game, which could quite possibly have potential for hours and hours of bloodsoaked surgical madness.

												Ah yes, Surgeon Simulator 2013. There's a reason why it is NOT called Surgery Simulator, mainly because the operations in this game is extremely wacky and way off the standard protocol. (Surgery without gloves? Blasphemy!)You control a faceless surgeon who apparently has only one hand. (Which might also be the reason why he isn't wearing gloves, because how on Earth would someone put on gloves with only one hand without assistance from others?) Operations include heart transplant, double kidney transplant and brain surgery (which are the only ones I've unlocked so far, I hear there are secret missions that can be unlocked besides the TF2 crossover). Each operation can be repeated in a different setting other than the usual operating theatre, such as in a speeding ambulance and in a zero gravity environment. The controls are.......unique, as the keys are mapped according to which finger is used to tap each key. This means you have full finger control (finger gestures abound). But, full control does not mean simplicity, as you have to control the wrist and arm movements with the mouse. Therefore, to say the very least, the controls are very tricky, but once you have played several sessions you'll have some degree of mastery with it. Overall, it is a game with a quite steep learning curve, but the satisfaction gained when completing an operation is immense. 8 out of 10.			"

The content here isn't the most accurate when portraying organ transplants, and you won't be using your right hand solely for motion & your left hand solely for gripping in real surgery, let alone perform transplants in both a hospital & ambulance setting.All in all, if you want some silly fun turning an unconscious person into a corpse, go ahead with Surgeon Simulator 2013.

												It seems like one of those games where the controls are so awfully weird, it's there just to screw around and try to do it. But the cool thing is, once you get used to the controls, you can actually try and do procedures as quick as possible.It's nice use of AWER and Space actually feel pretty comfortable and better than something like QWOP. You have a grading system that grades your performance based on how much blood was lost, and how fast you did it. This offers up the way to figure out what tools to use, and when to use 'em. For what music there is, it's nice background noise too. The Team Fortress 2 DLC was a very nice addition, and it makes me think this game also has pretty good DLC potential.			"

												I remember being pretty confused by this game when I first saw it on Rage Quit. Was it trying to be sincere and doing a horrible job at it, or are the difficult controls a part of the joke? Thankfully it's the latter. This isn't surgery like a true surgeon would do... it's more like what I imagine an alien were to do if it found out its pet human needed a new organ. Just start jamming tools in there, removing everything that's in the way, then casually putting a new organ where the old one was. Done and done.If you love dark humor and a serious challenge, pick this game up.			"

More of a slaughterhouse that some patient called Bob walked into expecting a brain, double kidney and a heart transplant. There's probably something very wrong with him...But, I digress.

At first the game may be very hard and frustrating but once you get the hang of it you can have A LOT of fun with all the different opperations even knowing they're the same three transplants but in different situations such as in the back of an ambulance. There is also about seven total ""special"" operations that require you do do something besides a heart, double kidney, or brain transplant such as the Überheart transplant set in the Team Fortress 2 universe.

This game is not for everyone, though, so if you feel like you are playing QWOP: You Are Not Alone and The Truth is Out There......in Medical School and Residency, I mean, where actual doctors learn that stuff.

												I was watching some of the major youtubers play this while it was in the beta. I found it quite trivial thinking it'd be like another generic simulator game, being fun at first and getting boring later. That had apparently not become the problem. I had bought this game when it first came out. It was at $15 and I thought to myself, ""Wow, that's bloody expensive! This better be worth it."", and ever since that day it had been the best $15 I've ever spent. This gave me hours of enjoyment and something to relax with even though it may cause a lot of frustration and anger, it's quite relaxing knowing that you go in without any sense of wanting to complete the game for the story (since it has no story). The game is best played in company of others, while others may either see you fail the operation or complete it, it will either make them all laugh or praise you as ""THE GOD OF SURGERY!"". Watching Rooster Teeth's Michael and Gavin play the game together had given me an idea, playing the game with 2 players where 1 controls the fingers and the other controls the arm would make for a great party game or challenge. As it proves the synchroniation between 2 people for the greater humor or the professionality of the pair.With everything said, I would recommend this game to all people who are looking for a game to enjoy with friends and company of other people.

This game teaches us just how safe and easy performing surgery really can be. Vital signs? Anesthesiologists? Left hands?

												SHUT UP NURSE! I KNOW WHAT'S BEST! Ah, the references! This game is the most halarious game I've ever played, next to Octodad:Dadliest Catch. This game makes you play as Nigel, a surgeon who only lives as a hand. You operate on your patients, and make sure they get the right implant. Why not throw in a wrench into your patient's chest? Meh, they'll live.			"

												A fun, interesting and challenging game designed to promote anger management classes. Unique gameplay, with comical surgical procedures designed to test the intentional awkward controls to its max. Challenging achievements keeps you hooked and red in the face. Normally i'm very anger free during gaming, but this one really tested my patience. The anniversary additions adds extra challenges with the frustrating corridor scenario, as well as new eye and tooth transplant surgeries. "

												I love this game. Sugeon Simulatory 2013 is a hyperrealistic simulation experience that will inspire and train a new generation of physicians. I wouldn't be surpised if it also paves the way for alternative forms of surgery by people not classically seen as qualified. This game teaches us just how safe and easy performing surgery really can be. Vital signs? Anesthesiologists? Left hands? Unnecessary As an infectious particle, I have spent hours playing this game in order to discover new aveneues of infection to explore. The prospects expand every time I play the game, and I always await new downloadable content to expand my repertoire. Please play this game. Our very future depends on it.			"

												Hello Ladies and Gentlemen and welcome to my review of Surgeon Simulator! in this cartoon style simulation game you play as the worst surgeon ever hired as you attempt to give several transplants and hope your paitents die so they can't sue you for malpractice.pros+Very creative take using a first person perspective to desimate your pateints and then lazily toss a organ inside of them!+The Ambluance levels are very creative thought frustrating to watch the transplant organ fly out the back once you hit a bump in the road+Tf2 inspired Dlc for free where you operate on heavy!?cons-Sometimes the controls are a little too frustrating for me -the lack of other surgeons in the room seems rathe odd for me considering I've been to a actually surgery and watch professional surgeons operate with a teamSo in the long run this game is a blast that I deffinatly reccomend buying and give a it a juicy score of 8.5/10.So heres to killing another paitent and never being sued!

												On first glance appearing as a badly thrown together physics game that simply doesn't work the game will for most people suddenly reveal its genius after significant trial and error.All of a sudden you start noticing the absurd british humour, the subtle (Or not so subtle) political commentary on a view of the British national health service and you start to understand just how the game works and start becoming good at it. To the point where your not just trying to accomplish a heart surgery in the back of a moving ambulance, your seeing how quickly you can do it, if you can do it using only a fire extinguisher and a pair of scissors. Your seeing exactly how much crap you can place in the chest cavity of a patient mid operation and trying desperately to pry a kidney out from some ribs using a plastic spoon.There are plenty of frustrations, due to a niave expectation of how the game 'should' play to the occasional physics bug that can cause your hands or a scapel to get stuck in awkward situations (between ribs, in a fridge [Yes, there is a firdge] etc). Rising above these frustrations and learning from is key to getting the best from this game.This is no game of the year. But it is suprisingly intelligent and funny. Frankly if you don't have it, your missing out on something most people don't encounter very often. A new experience.			"

The content here isn't the most accurate when portraying organ transplants, and you won't be using your right hand solely for motion & your left hand solely for gripping in real surgery, let alone perform transplants in both a hospital & ambulance setting.All in all, if you want some silly fun turning an unconscious person into a corpse, go ahead with Surgeon Simulator 2013.

												If you want to be a qaulified surgeon one day, play this game...Hammering a rib cage and tossing organs in every direction should be considered part of your practice, if it's not... well you're doing it wrong because according to this game i've saved many lives.This game is not as hard as everyone makes it out to be, with enough patience and practice it becomes difficult... instead of impossible.If you're not patient you might end up throwing your mouse and keyboard at your computer screen in complete and utter rage :3You need to play this game. <3			"

												""Look guys! No hands!"" - Doctor. A really fun game with multiple levels (ie surgery room, ambulance, space). If you are easily sickened by cartoon blood, you are gonna want to steer clear; you will be breaking bones, taking out lungs and just throw it on the ground, and lose a heart somewhere near the OJ. A fun game to stream if you're a streamer. And a great game to play when you're bored.			"

												+ Sillyness+ Lots of easter eggs and fun details.- Tools being unreachable only due to limitations on how far your hand can move 'up'- Minor thing: wish you had slight more control over your head/camera posistion sometimes.  Even something simple like a 'tilt' so you can see what you are doing a little better.I wasn't expecting this.  You know what a baby looks like playing with toys.  They'll take a toy and very stiff-armedly bang away on something trying to replicate what they've seen an adult do while giggling or something.  That is essentially what this feels like.  You are in the shoes of a half mad-doctor, half man-child with little to no fine motor skills.Trying to perform surgery with controls this limited can certainly be frustrating at times, but at the same time, it's what provides a lot of the humor and ridiculousness to what you are doing.  If you had perfect controls the game would not work the same way.  Flailing around an arm and accidentally dropping a power drill into someones chest cavity while trying to do a heart transplant in the back of a moving ambulance is all part of the charm of the game.There is plenty of interactive small details to find and play with.  Even in your office.  Like a little playground, all this little stuff adds up to make a fun experience.  Plenty of subtle things like you'd find sprinkled into a Valve or Blizzard game.  It's been a long time since a game made me crack a smile.Don't be put off by the odd controls, once you get a little practice with them you'll be able to do what you intend to do (relatively speaking).  The awkwardness and sillyness they provide is part of the game.Recommended if you have a little patience and want to have a good time for a few hours.  And there is plenty more to do if you want to explore and try to get every little thing done.			"

												This game may certainly be one of the most underrated games I ever played. There is all that is needed. From a joke, it went to be a fun and challenging piece of work. It is difficult to master, but when you finally do, you love it even more. Levels get harder, achievements are rewarding, riddles make you wonder for two days with the whole community... Not to mention the devs are really here for the players, always adding content. A pleasure !EDIT : now can depilate brows & mustache. 11/10			"

												Have you ever wanted to perform brain surgery by smashing someone's head in with a hammer?Do you sometimes feel like ripping a man's heart out with your bare hands(and the occasional use of whatever tools you find)?Are you aspiring to become a surgeon?If you answered yes to the last question, leave right now!If you answered yes to any of the other two, buy this game.

Probably fun when you are drunk and have friends over at your place. Anything besides that..not really. Still not bad, you know. Personal rating 7/10			"

												This is a VERY fun game that is hidden in frustration. At first the game may be very hard and frustrating but once you get the hang of it you can have A LOT of fun with all the different opperations even knowing they're the same three transplants but in different situations such as in the back of an ambulance. There is also about seven total ""special"" operations that require you do do something besides a heart, double kidney, or brain transplant such as the Überheart transplant set in the Team Fortress 2 universe. Have fun oddly transplanting different organs and not putting anything else back inside.			"

												Ok So all i can say about Surgeon Simulator 2013 is that its a silly little entertaining Simulator where you smash your patients Skull, Ribs, everything open... With a Hammer... But there is more every surgery is diffrent Sometimes u are in Ambulance some times in space.Sometimes the game glitches funny ways examply your drill will get stuck inside your patients ribs and it just makes your patient (named Bob) bleed. Did i already mention you smash your patients ribs and skull open with a Hammer?But yeah if you have some time to kill i recommend this game. Keep in mind you need patience it is very hard. Controls are made to be silly but when you get in the hang of them you are king of the world!I would rate this game...7.50/10			"

												I bought this game immediately after i saw the new Trump DLC and Discount, i thought ""Yea, why not, must be hilarious"". For a buck game, really worth your whileIf you're up for cheese and humors, go for itif you have haemophobia,then i'll suggest leave it.The game is pretty simple in idea but very entertaining as a flying hippo(also, guys... don't take this too seriously. It's not what you're looking for if you want to be a doctor, go take a real class)Pros:+Very funny to mess with +Bob has many diseases (which means many variety of surgery)+Tons of levels and difficulty+Feels like a real surgery (it's a simulator, duh)+Feels very british! (better if they had added Tea)+Awesome graphics @ glorious 60FPS [PC Master Race]Cons:-Somewhen the game feels glitchy and minor bugs also present (visit my screenshots for proof)-if you're uneasy with rage quitting, forget the game (some levels like the space and ambulance really takes my time)-If you drop your tools/ organs to right below you hand, that's it. No retrieving it.So, i'll say a yes for a game with many fun features (TF2 surgery is the best part, wait...) go thumbs up for this review so Bob doesn't have any diseases in the future.  "

												I am ready for Med School! Omg... This is why I don't go to have a surgery! This has got to be one of the funnier games I played. I began my day at the hospital by throwing EVERYTHING off my tables. That was my morning until I had lunch. The phone rang so I threw it off the table as well, received an acheivment,I then took control of my ADHD and decided to operate. I then stuck a bunch of needles in my hand and cut my fingers on a huge blade. All of that while the patient is laying with his whole freakin chest wide open and I didn't forget to smack him around as well.WHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS? GO BUY IT! Best Med School prep, I guess now I see why Asian doctors are so good.10/10 Would go to med school again.			"

In this episode, Mr Bean goes to a hospital to get his depth perception problems treated, but is mistaken for a surgeon of the highest quality and promptly locked in a room alone with someone with his chest carved open. Seeing no other choice, Mr Bean flips the patient off, makes him wear his intestines as a scarf, injects himself with a mystery substance, jams a fork into an electrical socket and passes out in a pool of the patients' blood.

												I bought this game immediately after i saw the new Trump DLC and Discount, i thought ""Yea, why not, must be hilarious"". For a buck game, really worth your whileIf you're up for cheese and humors, go for itif you have haemophobia,then i'll suggest leave it.The game is pretty simple in idea but very entertaining as a flying hippo(also, guys... don't take this too seriously. It's not what you're looking for if you want to be a doctor, go take a real class)Pros:+Very funny to mess with +Bob has many diseases (which means many variety of surgery)+Tons of levels and difficulty+Feels like a real surgery (it's a simulator, duh)+Feels very british! (better if they had added Tea)+Awesome graphics @ glorious 60FPS [PC Master Race]Cons:-Somewhen the game feels glitchy and minor bugs also present (visit my screenshots for proof)-if you're uneasy with rage quitting, forget the game (some levels like the space and ambulance really takes my time)-If you drop your tools/ organs to right below you hand, that's it. No retrieving it.So, i'll say a yes for a game with many fun features (TF2 surgery is the best part, wait...) go thumbs up for this review so Bob doesn't have any diseases in the future.  "

												Have you ever wanted to throw someone's organs at them while they are asleep?What about cut someone's brain stem by throwing an axe at it?Or conduct eye surgery by electrocuting yourself and smacking them around with a hammer?In all seriousness this game is a lot of fun. It takes a bit of getting used to and the controls can be infuriating at first but it is definitely worth playing. Completing the basic surgeries is ok but the part that makes this game shine is when you start going for the surgery achievements. I would buy this game again at full price in a heart beat, If you can get it on sale even better.			"

												Welcome to Surgeon Simulator 2013, where you get to step into the shoes of our protagonist, a (rather clumsy) surgeon. As the name suggests, you get to be a surgeon in-game and you can perform operations of varying degrees of difficulty. I will give in-depth details below, based on what I have garnered from my playtime:The game is very open-ended. The only objective you have is to perform the surgery without killing off your patient (read: bleeding him to death). There are a variety of tools available and you can generally use most of them to achieve your goal. There is, of course a best possible way to achieve something and a worst possible way but hey, it's just a game.Since there is no actual science involved, the surgeries in themselves are hilarious and it just results in hours and hours of fun; also, I am pretty sure brain transplants aren't possible yet. The absence of any real science gives a humorous edge to the game.Another thing I really enjoyed was the part where I could perform the uber-heart transplant (is that what it's called?) on the Heavy weapons guy (you play as the Medic from TF2). It was extremely hilarious and reminded me of ye olde TF2 trailer, and playing it was like a reward for all the effort it took to put the VHS tape into the damn machine.The controls were really awkward (A-W-E-R-space) and it takes time to get accustomed to be able to control all five fingers of one hand, but that's what makes the game a real challenge and not just a let's-kill-that-guy-by-poking-his-ribs-with-a-screwdriver kind of game. It's a game, and there should be some challenge, and this game offers even that.It's summer sale and the price is right, the game is totally worth what it costs. Go and buy it. (It also has Steam Trading Cards so you can proudly flaunt your fake medical license badge on Steam lol.)TL;DR: Crack someone's sternum with a hammer for a heart transplant.			"

												I have heard some people complain about the controls and physics of this game but you have to understand you can't take this game too seriously. The controls are terrible on purpose, things drop and fall out of your reach on purpose, this game is supposed to be comedic. I've tried playing it on my laptop without a mouse but I couldn't move the hand up/down or rotate the hand without it. So make sure you have a mouse before you buy.The game will be frustrating if you take it too seriously, just remember to laugh it off.			"

												I would suggest this game to anyone, and I mean ANYONE with half a funny bone in their body (btw, you might have to transplant one in this game XP), this game is just a lot of fun, it is challenging, funny, and each level is unique enough to keep unintersted players going. If you find this game on sale you should buy it, if it is not on sale you should buy it, if the price spikes $50 you should still buy it. It has been a very entertaining game for me (I mostly played it on my friend's computer, I have a total of about 10 play hours with this game) Tip: don't get the regular version, get AE Edition, adds a TON of content: better graphics (way better), new intro, new hallway mode, two new surgeries for each mode, and the soundtrack, in total gameplay it adds a mode and 11 new surgeries for a total of 22 (regular has just 11), Anneversary Edition is way betterI give this game a solid 9.5/10			"

												Welcome to Surgeon Simulator 2013, where you get to step into the shoes of our protagonist, a (rather clumsy) surgeon. As the name suggests, you get to be a surgeon in-game and you can perform operations of varying degrees of difficulty. I will give in-depth details below, based on what I have garnered from my playtime:The game is very open-ended. The only objective you have is to perform the surgery without killing off your patient (read: bleeding him to death). There are a variety of tools available and you can generally use most of them to achieve your goal. There is, of course a best possible way to achieve something and a worst possible way but hey, it's just a game.Since there is no actual science involved, the surgeries in themselves are hilarious and it just results in hours and hours of fun; also, I am pretty sure brain transplants aren't possible yet. The absence of any real science gives a humorous edge to the game.Another thing I really enjoyed was the part where I could perform the uber-heart transplant (is that what it's called?) on the Heavy weapons guy (you play as the Medic from TF2). It was extremely hilarious and reminded me of ye olde TF2 trailer, and playing it was like a reward for all the effort it took to put the VHS tape into the damn machine.The controls were really awkward (A-W-E-R-space) and it takes time to get accustomed to be able to control all five fingers of one hand, but that's what makes the game a real challenge and not just a let's-kill-that-guy-by-poking-his-ribs-with-a-screwdriver kind of game. It's a game, and there should be some challenge, and this game offers even that.It's summer sale and the price is right, the game is totally worth what it costs. Go and buy it. (It also has Steam Trading Cards so you can proudly flaunt your fake medical license badge on Steam lol.)TL;DR: Crack someone's sternum with a hammer for a heart transplant.			"

												Have you ever wanted to throw someone's organs at them while they are asleep?What about cut someone's brain stem by throwing an axe at it?Or conduct eye surgery by electrocuting yourself and smacking them around with a hammer?In all seriousness this game is a lot of fun. It takes a bit of getting used to and the controls can be infuriating at first but it is definitely worth playing. Completing the basic surgeries is ok but the part that makes this game shine is when you start going for the surgery achievements. I would buy this game again at full price in a heart beat, If you can get it on sale even better.			"

												This is one of those games that you show to your friends, and everyone begs you to let them have a go on it. But the thing is, you don't want to let them have a go because you're too busy hammering away at the patients rib-cage to even notice your friends are in the room. When you've only got a little while to spare, you'll find yourself opening up this game. Whilst the storyline is a little outrageous, the amount of fun that you'll have getting used to the controls and getting stuck right into a heart transplant (warning: contains no medical accuracy, whatsover!) far outweights the outrageousness. The developers have given it a bit of a sense of humor too, even the title menu is a game all in it's self! There's secret missions, and hilarious achievements everywhere, waiting to be found. Just for the love of god, don't drop your wristwatch or a scalpel into the patient, it's a bit of a pain to get back out again.Anyway, usually I'm not a massive indie game fan, but this is utter brilliance. I've seen the price drop super low during the sales for this game, and I bought it myself at the lowest price I've seen yet, but I'd happily pay more than what I already have for this game, and that's saying something!

												Not an actual surgeon simulator - just a silly game about trying to perform surgery using only a selection of appropriate and not-so-appropriate tools manipulated by a ridiculously hard-to-control human arm. It's actually quite fun once you get the hang of it, and the surgical procedures are fully do-able. Just don't expect to do a professional job!The game was originally extremely short but has been expanded to include an outer-space mode for its three basic surgeries and an extra set of operations on a space alien in which the organs have ludicrous names and you have to basically guess your way through the alien's unfamiliar anatomy, which is more fun than it sounds.

												Surgeon Simulator 2013 doesn't feel like an actual game nor does it try to recreate surgery within a game. What it does do is add humour in the way that the controls are merely clunky and unforgiving whilst you nervously attempt to carry out surgery. The game itself is funny for about 5 minutes as the character you are controlling is so clumsy that he knocks over everything in his sight but I don't think Surgeon Simulator 2013 is really a game that is intended to be serious. What it does do exceptionally well is try and attempt to put you in a situation where you are mentally instable, drunk and have no idea what you are doing, yet manage to carry out surgery. I wouldn't say that this a game worthy of its £6.99 pricetag seeing as it really is nothing but silliness and a short moment of laughs. I guess it would give good bragging rights if you're able to complete surgery in the fastest time with the least blood lost or whatever but as a standalone game to pay money for? Nope.			"

												I would recommend buying the base game of Surgeon Simulator if you have been thinking about it. It is great fun and actually quite addicting, plus the achievements for this game are simple yet challenging enough to make you want to complete all of them. Or at least it made me want to try and get them all. The soundtrack is so good that I bought it (available on Bandcamp) and the game itself is really well optimised. So by all means buy the base game. However,The new 'Anniversary Edition' content for this game I cannot possibly reccomend. The menus are completely changed to be more touch friendly and less mouse friendly, which is actually quite a big deal when you have to manually push each button with your virtual hand. The 2 new surgeries are pretty finickity and dull compared to the old ones, and for some reason they don't look half as good. Although this could be due to my next point. There is a new extended options menu in the DLC, this gives you all the options you would expect for a standard PC game. But, for some reason the new setting lag the game to crap. On the base game there was low, medium and high graphics settings. On my 3.2 Ghz i7 8GB ram PC I could run the old base game on high without any lag issues or slowing of any sort with no noticable drops in FPS. But with the new DLC the game lags even on the lowest settings, and the highest settings don't look half as good as they used to. This for me is the biggest problem with the DLC, it must have been shipped out in a hurry with little to no optimisation. There's a new corridor mode and lots of new achievements (which you have available even without the DLC, making it impossible to 100% the Steam achievements without buying the DLC) but really this expansion has ruined the base game for me and after playing it for an hour I uninstalled the expansion all together. Unless there is an update pretty soon I'm going to be hoping Austrailia's court case for Steam refunds goes worldwide, and then ask for one myself.Base game 10/10Expansion -10/10 (because it also ruins the base game)			"

												7/10In a word ""GGgggggggggggggggggyyyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!""The learning curve on this one is ridiculously steep, and not for the faint of heart.

												I reccomend this game. Listen, if you think I'm in no place to be judging it, take this into concideration:I legitimately got an A++ on every mission, and I got a 100% no blood loss brain sugery.I know what I'm talking about.Lots of people complain about the way this game runs, but it runs perfectly for me and I have a terrible pc. I can barely run skyrim on medium graphics. This game runs perfectly if you want to mess with the options a small bit.The game's controls are terrible.BUT THAT'S THE POINT. YOU'RE PLAYING AS A DRUGGED UP SURGEON. YOU'RE NOT MEANT TO BE IN CONTROL OF A SOBER HUMAN, YOU PLAY AS NIGEL BURK, A MAN ADDICTED TO PILLS. Hence why he has drugs on his desk (pills) and why you can inject yourself with the hallucinatory drugs during the operations.If you still feel like I don't know enough about this game, I can tell you that I have all of the achievements :/I definately reccomend this game, it's long, it takes a while to learn, and it's fun. Slamming radios into people's ribcages is fun. Drilling a hole in your patient's head is fun. Making your patient a timelord is fun. Getting every mission A++'d is fun.This game is fun. I reccomend it especially with the new update for the anniversary coming out.			"

												This game is hilarious! The absolute mayham is funny not because it's trying to be funny, but that it is just IN-YOUR-FACE WTF moments. The first thing to mention is the controls. Genius! Takes a while to get used to, but that's part of the fun! The acheivements have little comments about pop-culture that will make you chuckle, but some of the best things happen in the reception desk. Try and pick up the phone sometime, and you'll get a funny call from one of Nigel's friends. The best part of this game is the surgeries. ""Takes someone's lungs, intestines, and ribs to replace a heart. I think the patient will live."" The absolute neglect of carefulness with the patient (Bob) is hilarious. But hey, you can lodge a drill into a guy's skull, and that's always fun (I am not a murderous psycopath)! I highly reccomend this game. Best Simulator I've ever played. 9/10			"

												Surgeon Simulator 2013 is a over-the-top humourous game that has to do with surgery, but it's not too serious when it comes to performing a heart transplant or kidney. It's also fictional because of the brain transplant, I mean c'mon you can't perform a brain transplant in real life, but this game went above and put it in anyways just for the hell of it. I got to thank the community for voting this great, fast-paced, humourous game into steam so I'm really happy I got this game of course.     This game's final score would be 9.4/10 as it's humor, and fast-paced action was good, and I got to admit for about a few months I was addicted to the music and I couldn't stop playing it.			"

This game will teach you the basics of becoming a surgeon such as sticking drills in your patients, completely removing the lungs, and denying malpractice.

												You're a disembodied, outstretched forearm with no elbows. Nothing works. You can barely pick up a pencil from a table. What's more, the collision physics either sends things flying or has them slip away, even when you know what to do. That Jurassic Park Trespasser game from years ago already ""blessed"" us with a similar sort of absurd interface as it asked players to kill dinosaurs, so there's only one remaining course of action: perform transplant surgeries with zero in-game tutorials or instruction provided until after you've already succeeded.This is absolutely not something you want to go to Youtube or GameFAQs for instruction on when you're stuck. That'll just ruin the game for you. For SS2013 is a game about screwing things up royally and not really minding too much that you've done so. In fact, most of the ""achievements"" are granted based on ridiculous ways to screw things up, not succeed. For although you're presented with all sorts of tools to go about your task, most of them are either useless or actively detrimental. Normally, this would all make for an atrocious experience. But the ""Simulator"" of the title is a complete and absolute lie. I originally had a paragraph elaborating on this, but the joy is seeing for yourself. Originally made in 48 hours, the ""2013"" version of this game was made in 48 days. The absurd novelty of it all it seems to be part of a slight swell of indie ""perform mundane tasks in goofy fashion"" games. There are 8 operations total, but only 4 unique procedures. Naturally, the toughest one of all--the heart transplant--is what they have you do first!I paid $3.39 for this and got about 9 hours playtime out of it. WORTH EVERY CENT.			"

												A heartwarming story about a man named Nigel Burke who was born with a physical and mental disability that made him unable to speak, write and he only had one hand. He also had trouble controlling his body movements as his brain functioned slowly. One day, he litterally ran into an old friend of his with his car and that old friend was Bob. Bob was his one and only friend at school and took care of Nigel everytime he got bullied. Bob had no idea how Nigel even got a car, as he had no liscense. As soon as Nigel rushed Bob to the hospital, the Doctors said they would not have enough time to save Bob. Nigel, not willing to give up on his old pal, immediately rushed into the surgery room and performed the surgery himself. The surgeons impressed, hired Nigel, and Nigel lived happly ever after, going to his new job everyday to find himself crashing his car into Bob everyday. Injuring a different part of Bob and having to perform surgery on him each day.29/10 - IGNOPTiC Clan Approved#1 Swaggiest game on steam - {LINK REMOVED} "

And once your used to them and all your tools and puncture points, you're on your way to become the world's greatest surgeon, Maybe even out of this world (spoiler alert)Sometimes, you may just want to feel like sticking your hand into the game when their left kidney jusy wont cooperate getting out. That is not a good feeling. But one just mad enough to make you want to keep trying. It's worth the money.

												Best game ever! Better than any old RPG like the Elder Scroll Series!Final Fantasy should learn from this...Last of Us, best game of the year...please don't make me laugh. This game surpasses both genres easily. Seriously guys, uninstall your League of Legends and Dota and play this game instead!! You think those are MOBAs, this is true MOBA!For those of you fighting maniacs, Marvel vs Capcom, Tekken, and Street Fighter, you haven't played a true fighting game if you haven't fought for your patient's life in Surgeon Simulator!What is Hearthstone...where is the heart?? Surgeon Simulator contains a real heart! Plus, it uses more imagination than Minecraft!! For those of you who hates your children playing violent FPS games like COD, buy this game instead, as it will teach your children to help save people instead of brutally murdering their brains out!This game has a better ending than Walking Dead! Because you will experience the Walking Live!!!You like Sims?? Then how about you try surgeon SIM- ulator!! :< Do you know who you are paying that enormous amount of money when you die in GTA?? IT IS NIGEL BURKE you are paying! Wish you can be like Yoda?? Well go in space to perform surgery and you can use the Force!You want to save a princess like Mario? Why would you when you can save BOB!Want to be like Le Bron? Throw a brain into a skull! Half-Life and Portal - make way for Surgeon Simulator 2013!!! This game should even be remade in XBOX ONE and PS4!I think that STEAM made a mistake of putting only three genres for Surgeon Simulator. Any genre you can think of, it's there! Romance - steal the heart of your patient! Multiplayer - take turns with your friends! Even racing - you need way more speed than Need for Speed!!!Buy SURGEON SIMULATOR 2013 game now! Why would you want to buy anything I listed before?? And don't buy it as gift..put it in your library NOW...before it's too late :)			"

												Recommended if you are patient only. Hillarious but the humor will wear off. Everyone else, skip it. Unless if you are forcing yourself to play these games to some how teach yourself patience. Lol! The most frustrating game! This is the same as OCTODAD game and other similar sim games where you try to do something and the only challenge is either gravity or the fact that the game won't let you get things done because it offers no other skill other than the game itself preventing you to play it. My experience with it was: step 1 do what they want me to do.step 2 I can't so i try something else.step 3 watching the patient die because i couldnt do what i was supposed to do.step 4 killing the patient from doing more damage to it.step 5 pass the challenge or fail and re-try.step 6 the humor fades and you realise there are too many games like these and so many others that are world's better. This is a short entertainment only.It has no challenge and no skill. It is like the devs wanted to make a game and couldn't so it handles terribly and then they slap a sim label on it. There is a lot more to a sim game besides this. Plenty of other sim games out there. Preventing a player from playing & then charging them for it shouldn't be considered a challenge at any point in time.Space engineers is a sand box game for builders but that quickly went out the window since things are moving away from you every time and there is no real setting to remove that function in sand box mode. This is not recommended for impatient people. It reminded me of this game where there is a constant in-game interruption preventing you from playing. Recommended for the patient people only. Worth it's price but just not for me.			"

												You play the akward left arm of a suspicious 'surgeon' conducting various very, very sensitive operations in very not subtle ways. With pretty much full control of the arm, hand and wrist movements of said underqualified left arm, you must conduct transplants as best as you can without butchering your vict...er patient. The overall akwardness of the controls and style of the game lead to some incredibly amusing situations where you are daintily trying to level out someones brain with a pencil, accidentally drug yourself or decide a hammer is the best way to get rid of that pesky ribcage. Surgeon Simulator is not a serious game by any means and really comes into itself when played with two people locally, strangely not advertised as this is the most fun part of the experience imo. One person controls the fingers and the other controls the arm and wrist. Let the insanity ensue!			"

A funny but frustrating game!This game is not one to be taken too seriously, as it is basically another version of QWOP or any of those other reaally annoying games. The game has some humour like you can rip body parts out of the patient and he/she/alien will still survive.This is a more polished version than the free one you can find on the internet, and it provides a lot more challenges and characters to operate on such as an alien or the heavy from Team Fortress 2. Also, I think that the operations are actually more beatable in this version.This game is more of a hilarious way to pass the time and if you like goofing around then this is the game for you!			"

Yep ever wanted to smash a president rib-cage and give him a gold heart? This game is just for you.Graphics/visuals: It's pretty standard looking for me considering I can only run this on normal sadly.Bugs: This game is pretty buggy sometimes but most of the time it won't ruin the game. MOST TIMES...8.5/10 Not enough presidents to give hearts to. "

And I'm pretty sure my wristwatch is still in the chest cavity.She looked at me funny.Anyway, it won't hold your attention for long, but it's definitely worth picking up on sale if you want to try something different for a day or two.

												*Beep* *Beep* *Beep*The steady rythm of the paiten's heart monitor only added to the tension as I strapped on my digital wrist watch and prepped for my first day in surgery. Doctor Hoffman said I was ready. My wife encouraged me on by promising me a healthy Brinner when I got home. I had a drive to not let this paitent go. Brinner is every man's fantasy.So I picked up my knife. I didn't need any gloves, I knew my hands were clean. Wiping the sweat off my brow I opened my paitent up then suddenly I felt my hand move involuntarily. It was as if I had a sudden case of Parkensons disease. Shaking and trembling I grabbed the hammer. With a thud I hear it slam into the rib cage of my paitent, shattering the ribs to pieces. (#*$(@ I just done screwed up my first surgery. The nurse screaming at the ammount of blood loss the paitent was having. I quickly grabbed the heart and threw it into the garbage. Then taking the transplant heart I dropped it in and then the Nurse told me I had pased. My grade was A.Being the pro surgeon I was I called it a day. I figured the paitent's body would fix the other messes I made. I went home and enjoyed my Brinner.It was a good Brinner.A+ Very relistic simulation.P.S. The paitent did in fact live.			"

												Surgeon Simulator is a hilarious simulation of a surgeon named Nigel attempting to perform different operations on a patient by the name of Bob. In this game, surgery tends to be the least of your problems in this game, you'll need more precision actually picking up the tool and holding it correctly. This game definitely won't help you through medical school, but it sure is entertaining and will keep you busy for a few hours. Overall, this game isn't worth $10. However, this game tends to go on sale quite often for $2.50, so I would snag it then if you could. Have fun!			"

												In Surgeon simulator you play an overconfident drunk surgeon that can do the medical magic with just one hand.It certainly isn't a simulator of any kind, that part seems more of a joke.It's a fun game to play once in a while for the lolz.			"

												Personally, I do not enjoy this game. Maybe it's because I'm not good at it or I've just lost interest. But here's my review of it.For one, the graphics are nice and simplistic. The controls themselves are tricky, but that's part of the game. The tasks you must complete are nice because it isn't the exact same thing each time. It places you in different environments and allows you to use a wide range of tools to complete your given task. The music is nice and so is the fact that you can kill your patient. Once again, I don't like this game but I know many people do, and I can see why. It's a good game for people who like difficult challenges and/or like to rage over losing a tool.7/10 Would say more but I don't know what else to say.			"

												I had an interest of this game, since PewDiePie made it so popular by surgering Bob and that creepy alien, so I decided to pick it at Christmas sale for 75% off. Surgeon Simulator is absolutelly amazing surgering simulation, where you have to perform a heart, kidney or brain transplant in surgery room, ambulance (yes, organs tend to fly out of the truck) and in the space. Game itself is beatable in fairly ~5 hours, depends on how well and fast you can control each finger and arm movement. Ofcourse, during the surgery, to increase entertainment, you will be provided with some unusual equipment, like shuriken and tomahawk. Yes, this game has many secret achievements, which took another 5 hours to get, but it was a great fun. I strongly suggest this game to anyone, who loves funny game-play and a lot of blood!My rating: 8.5/10			"

												""Frustrating"" is the best way to describe this...the controls are horrendous. People say that the creators meant to make the controls so awkard, but it's to the point that it's too unforgiving. I oftentimes dropped the green syringe out of frame by accident, which quickly leads to the patient bleeding out. This could be a pretty decent game with VR and motion controls, but M+K fails miserably. This novelty game relies too heavily on the poor controls as its difficulty factor, and I don't want to waste time figuring out the controls just the play the game.			"

												Well I can't say actually if I recommend that one or not. At your first few plays you will laugh a lot, but after that you will see how.. kind of dumb it is. There is none sense in everything. Atleast I didn't bought it on full price, but on a sale.# Graphics :: 7/10 - I'm totally honest, I kind of not like the graphics in that game. It's maybe because of the hundreds of graphic bugs or something. But it's my personal opinion.# Sound effects :: 8/10 - There is lack of some sounds, but most of the sound effects are good.# Gameplay :: 7.5/10 - Really hard to decide. It's not bad, but not good either. Sometimes it takes you few minutes to just deal with some tool, because it's hard as f**k to get it.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ### Overall :: 7.5/10 - definitely needs some improvement and for me personally this doesn't worth it's full price. You may want to try it cracked first before buying or watch some youtube gameplay, because you might end with money wasted.			"

												""They told me I could be anything. I became a alcholic doctor that had five shots of whiskey, half a bottle of vodka, seven beers, a bottle of rum, and drank almost two bottles of scotch.""- Wise words from a near dead homeless psychopathic drunk that you play in Surgeon Simulator 2013Let's start this review from this totally silly and insane game, with the difficulty and gameplay.Gameplay: This is hard. It's really flipping hard. My friends told me Fallout 3 was hard, but in comparistion it Fallout is like playing any Call of Duty game on easy mode. I do not recommend this game if you do not like hard games. I dont like this game very much. It's way too hard for a person like me. I shouldn't have to give you a warning! This game is about having to do surgery with one hand and having no one to help you. Remember what I say about the difficulty before buying this game, you little psychopath, you.Soundtrack: Amazing. Just......why wouldn't you like the soundtrack? Please go die in a nuclear fire if you dont like it.  Art style: I love it. Nigel's hand kind-of looks like the medic's hand in TF2. There is actually a TF2 styled level! You're the medic and you replace the heavy's heart, just like in the Meet the Medic trailer. And.....it's harder than I thought.........So...yeah.Why shouldn't I get this game?The only reason I can think of is....again....is that this game's really hard. If you're like me, I enjoy sawing through peoples bones, but the blood goes quick and cutting through the bones and kidneys and hearts and lungs is really hard to cut through with one hand. But if you think you're a good enough doctor to do it with one hand. Go right ahead.Why should I get this game?It's silly, original, and you get to show the middle finger to your soon-to-be victim. In the end, I recommend this game because it's something new! Something funny and silly! Get this game if you have bought the other awesome games of the sale. There may be better and more fun games than this, but this game will keep the glued to the screen for some time.8/10*Gaben voice* Thanks! And have fun!			"

												So I was recommended this game recently and it's been a journey to say the least.First off, understand this: Surgeon Simulator is a mock of a true simulator.  It is mocking other simulators complicated, sometimes frustrating controls, and it excels at that.  It is also is also a mockery of surgery in general, kind of a bummer if you ever played Life and Death from '88.  To be fair, a true surgery simulator wouldn't be well received.  This game has you breaking out ribcages, allows you to throw organs on the floor (after you take them out you don't put them back in, save for the replacement heart/kidney/brain), and has you do so with the most ridiculous tools available. To some, that sounds great.  Not me.  I enjoy true simulators such as MS Flight Sim, Euro Truck, and SimCity.  In those games, I don't really find the controls too challenging, so I don't really get the joke here.  I've heard of QWOP, which is essentially a jogging simulator where you control the thighs/calves separately, and must maintain balance while doing so.  Not really my cup of tea either.  So if you like the idea of frustratingly bad controls, or might find the humor in it, give it a try.  There's a free version out there (as any good sim should have) to make sure you enjoy before you buy.It's not for everyone, but it's for some.  There are definitely some hilarious moments, such as raging on your desk in reception, answering the phone, and making all the (rude) hand gestures at the patient, but after that the bad controls lost their luster on me.Surgeon Sim gets a 2/5.TawokSteam: Apocky+TawokPSN/Xbox: Tawok			"

												Surgeon Simulator 2013 is the dark and gritty tale of Nigel. Nigel is an ex-surgeon who gambles away all of his money on internet poker, and is violentely thrust back into the dark and traumatic world of surgery to pay off his debt. This game features Gore filled and riveting scenes such as Nigel preforming heart surgery, heart surgery in an ambualnce, heart surgery in space, heart surgery on an alien, heart surgery on the Heavy, and much more. If you're tired of all of the crap that the games industry has put out and are in need of a dark, shocking, emotionally powerful, and overall graphically stunning masterpiece that will make you question your own morals, then this game is for you.

												This game sucks so much it's awesome! Odd but surprisingly true! The controls are so ungodly bad (but innovative) it makes the game unneededly challenging, but that's the whole point of this game, trust me! Picking up a tool isnt as simple as.. well.. just picking it up. You will find Nigel to pick up the tool just however he wishes for (or more specificaly: how the tool just happend to be on the table).Don't dare to think this game to be a respectful (surgeon) simulator, because it's far from it. But this game isn't really bad, it has just been made to be ridiculous! And it works! For me atleast.But the controls are not the only thing that makes this game challenging. The first three operations (which are heart transplant, double kidney transplant and brain transplant) are in the surgeon room, but the next three operations are in a moving ambulance and the next three in space!! You maybe should not pay the whole 10€, (seriously, who would pay so much for a game that is so broken like it is?) Wait for a sale and then, whatever the price, it's worth your laughs! The 10€ price tag isn't there for how awesome this game is, i suppose, it's more likely because this game is so ridiculous. But that alone isn't worth much.But anyway, all in all, it's worth your laughs and you should try it!7.5/10PS. Who the hell does brain transplants anyway? O_O - Nigel does!			"

												This game is INCREDIBLY difficult, but that's actually the point. You have very basic control of your single hand, and can curl each finger individually, rotate the wrist, and generally move the whole arm around the screen in your pursuit of a variety of surgical feats. The difficulty in controlling the numb-seeming appendage is part of the appeal, and the actual hilarity of the game. Failure is not really a failure, as you can retry any surgery as many times as you want, and you even get rated on how quickly you can kill your patient. Of course, there's entertainment in succeeding in the surgery as well, including a rating, and the potential to unlock the next surgery. This game boasts several hidden surgeries, including with characters from TF2 (heavy and medic). It's delightyfully creative, a bit bloody, and generally quite fun.I would advise caution if you are squeamish, dislike the sight of blood, or find the thought of wrapping a patient's intestine around his neck (purely by accident) to be faintworthy.

Trying every instrument is also a lot of fun, never before could you do an entire surgery with a scalpel. For 10 Euro, you will be able to have a fun few days. You can spend many more days to try and perfect your score.I give this game a seven out of ten.			"

												What am I doing with my life..? :P It's a good game and it's etertaining. It takes a while to get used to the controlls and it is a bit difficult. You can edit the controlls in the options menu, but still... I don't think it is worth buying for full price.. I bought it on the holiday sale, but I haven't played it that much. I got really fast tired of it.I recomend it if you want a challenge and if you have always wanted to controll a doctors arm in the surgeryhall :P			"

												I love Surgeon Sim. I still play sometimes. I like playing in Skype calls and I'll screen share, make my friends tell me what to do while they oversee the operation. The game's clunky as **** but that's kind of the point. It runs great, and does what it tries to do well. There are a few levels I absolutely hate and feel the game would be much better without them. I like the  space  level but it's really hard tog rab things. I'm pretty good and it's still really hard. In more of a clunky way than a well designed diffuclty way. But like I said, that's kind of what the game's built around. Being beautifuly clunky.			"

												Surgeon Simulator 2013 is the best medical simulator released in 2006.  When it was released it was lauded for its realism and general helpfulness in training baby surgeons.  It has since been given several awards and is still used to train med school students and provides the best surgical training in a virtual environment.  I highly recommend it.  97 out of 100.			"

Trying every instrument is also a lot of fun, never before could you do an entire surgery with a scalpel. For 10 Euro, you will be able to have a fun few days. You can spend many more days to try and perfect your score.I give this game a seven out of ten.			"

You will at almost every point in a surgery want a refund, but a voice in your head will keep calling you saying, ""Jonathan, come back. I just want you to play me for the rest of your life."" Anyways, hope your experience isn't as terrifying as mine. If you're looking for an easy game, this isn't it. The iPhone/iPad version is a lot easier though. Be prepared.			"

												Surgeon Simulator 2013 is just one of those cool games that doesnt come around very often and it is very fun to play. It can also be hilarious trying to use a hammer to whack open a guys ribcage. But doing the same 3 surgeries ggets tiring after awhile and simple putting them in different environments doesnt really help much. 7.5/10			"

Trying every instrument is also a lot of fun, never before could you do an entire surgery with a scalpel. For 10 Euro, you will be able to have a fun few days. You can spend many more days to try and perfect your score.I give this game a seven out of ten.			"

												Have you ever spooned in bed with someone? You know how you never have a place for your non-spooning arm so you tuck it under your head, under your body or maybe just shove it behind you? And you know how after about 30 minutes spooning is no longer comfy and romantic because that extraneous arm is sound asleep and you have almost lost the feeling all the way up to your shoulder? Imagine right at that moment someone bursts into your bedroom with an already open patient on a gurney, many sharp dangerous tools, and screams ""Replace this man's heart!"" and then makes you perform the entire process with the dead, still sound asleep arm. That's Surgeon Simulation 2013.  And it's wonderful.			"

												This is hands down one of the best games I own in my Steam Library. It's highly entertaining and requires a great amount of skill, patience, persistence, and dedication. The soundtrack is amazing 80s-esque and the graphics aren't bad. There are a good amount of missions and plenty to keep you busy for a long time. I currently have 68% of the achievements but I don't think I'll get more than that. The timed achievements are ludicrously difficult. At times this game can be frustrating beyond belief, and there are glitches from time to time (hammer flying spontaneously from my hand, brain flailing/glitching once you pull it out during transplant, etc.). I happened to get this game on the cheap in a bundle and didn't really expect much from it. However, after all of the time I've put into it (20+ hours), I can easily say that it's worth every penny at the full price. I also bought the DLC for the additional operations since I enjoyed it so much. One thing that does bother me about this game is that the save game is stored in the registry (not steam cloud sync). If you move steam to another computer you will have to transfer the registry file to the new computer to get your progress back. There are resources on how to do this, just look around online if you have this issue like I did. Overall I really enjoyed this game, I just wish I was good enough to get 100% completion on the achievements. Maybe one day, a man can dream!			"

Unfortunately, Nigel has only one and even that one is hard to handle. But that shouldn't get in the way when there is surgery to be done, especially when it's transplants of the heart, kidneys and brain.With a tonne (metric) of achievements to keep the intensity on, and Team Fortress 2 characters joining the game for a special operation, Surgeon Simulator 2013 promises absolute hilarity, and that's just the main menu!

												Over the top.One of the many ways you can describe a game that tells you to give a man a brain transplant and then puts a hatchet, a power drill, a hand-operated buzz-saw and a high-powered laser within reach.In a world where you get an achievement for completing the transplants while both drugged and electrocuted, why would it even matter that your heart transplant patient was left with just a heart where there once laid a set of lungs, a stomach and a liver under a ribcage?The controls, while touch-and-go at times (though this was likely intended by the developers, else why would A, W, E, R, Space and the mouse be used to control a single arm and hand) make it a challenge yet to be seen in other games, albeit accompanied by many a time spent ranting and raving at the screen because you wanted to pick up the green syringe, not stab yourself with the blue one and impale a claw hammer in your patient.The ridiculousness of the game is only taken further by the challenge of performing the operations in an ambulance (complete with corners sending your equipment flying around and the doors opening before you can pick up the replacement heart), and then even further to space, meaning that you need to keep going back to make sure your scalpels are where you left them and not drifting off where you can't reach, and you need to make sure that the container for the organ is shut tightly, else it be lost to the back of the room. After that, you can even go so far as to operate on an alien, after accidentally stumbling across the jettison codes for the makeshift zero-g theatre and being abducted from the vacuum of space.All in all, it's a great way to pass the time. The game is specifically structured so that even killing your patient is difficult short of taking a hatchet to their skull.			"

												A great game to play alone, or with the aspiring doctor friend that you know!Wow them, with your abilities to drop in new organs!Enjoy the laughs of operating inside a moving ambulance!And remember kids! as long as it's not the organ you're putting in, it doesn't have to be put back after you remove it!Though, difficult to control at first, its the fun of it. Playing like a handicapped 5 year-old is much more fun than you'd expect.			"

												I did a brain surgery with a hammer. I got a drill stuck in someone's rib cage during heart surgery. And I made the patient wear their own intestines as a scarf after accidentally injecting myself with some sort of psychadellic drug that just happened to be lying around carelessly amongst the scalpels.

												I am a doctor from a very medical place. This is the most medical review I could think of, and believe me, I tried a lot of reviews. Surgeon Simulator got me to where I am today. Perfect training. My only problem is that now my patient is complaining that he has significantly less blood and a broken ribcage beyond repair. Interesting. I will note this down on the complimentary notepad with the complimentary pen provided at the start menu desk. Thanks Surgeon Simulator.			"

												It's like you're operating with one partially disabled hand and the other tied behind your back.   It's how I imagine a drunk surgery would go, honestly.   You'll kill tons of patients, you'll struggle to get the heart out, and you'll drop organs on the floor like an animal.  But it's great, silly fun.   The Team Fortress mission is great for fans of that series, as well.			"

												Cut, hack, smash, save, murder... Those are the things one can do in the comedic, ragdoll physics based game Surgeon Simulator 2013. Surgeon Simulator is a very addicting and fun game. It's pretty short yet I still find entertainment in doing the same surgeries repeatedly as there are a lot of tools and objects to try out. Speaking of objects Surgeon Simulator offers a wide variety of things to pick up and use on the patient or whatever is desired, ranging from the common medical scalpel to the unorthodox medieval battle axe. That's what makes Surgeon Simulator stand out. The absurd objects and physics. Over all Surgeon Simulator 2013 is a fine independent game with a lot of comic value making it a ton of fun.			"

												The concept is good, and while the game is hilarious because of the very bad controls I find the game difficult to legitimately play in a serious manner. If the game is cheap it's a worthy purchase because you can get some amusement out of it from time to time. I think the awkwardness of how it controls will kind of kill it for quite a few people, however. For that reason I can't really recommend it unless you're just looking to have a couple of laughs throwing stuff around awkwardly.			"

												    Imagine performing surgery within a claw-crane toy vending machine.  The surgeon's single hand is, by design, one of the clumsiest manifestations of inter-activity ever published.  Of course this would be the very point and what makes it so much fun! The difficulty in getting anywhere because of this intentional disconnect with user input can, however, be frustrating at times.  I personally require a mouse pad the size of Central Park in order to move the arm around (even on the highest sensitivity).  It's definitely presented as a joke game, not an achievement or skill game, although those things are very much required to get anywhere.  There is no advice or direction in how to approach a given surgery, lots of bloody fun in the trial and error.  Too difficult to grasp objects in general, it can take an eon to get the scalpel in your hand at the right angle for incision.  Certainly not realisitic, and the title ""simulator"" here must be taken with a grain of salt.  Or a salt mine even.         On the positive, I totally knew what I was getting into and got a deal on the game anyway, so it's no travesty that's happened here.  The game really is pretty funny, and that seems to be it's greatest achievement.  I had  dreams of a more balanced mix of sim and parody...but got mostly the latter.           If  the hand were SLIGHTLY more dexterous, I would've enjoyed it more.  I'm sure it must be rewarding for true mouse-keteers that eventually hone their precision with the movements... that seems the only way to advance passed the first surgery even.  When the difficulty in progressing becomes more frustrating than fun, a game generally loses me.			"

												Surgeon Simulator is a pretty epic title which will make your friends laugh, yourself rage, and the completionist in you boil with anticipation. While it is a pretty small scale affair, there is plenty of challange to be found in cutting people up and trying not to kill them. The basic concept is this, you have 3 different kinds of basic surgery (5 with the DLC) and have to perform them in the best possible way in a series of different locales (OR, [DLC: Corridor], Ambulance and Space)- with each completed task you  unlock both the next surgery and normally something snazzy for your desk. You can be given new things to play with, new floppy disk tutorials or hints towards secret surgeries. The secret surgeries add a total of 7 new challenges, and while at first they seem impossible it is very possible to struggle through them. As it stands Surgeon Simulator 2013: Anniversary Edition is much improved on its original offerings and will provide you with lots of enjoyment and rage. I do hope they continue to update this title and release new content but as it stands I do feel it is worth your time and money.			"

Unfortunately, Nigel has only one and even that one is hard to handle. But that shouldn't get in the way when there is surgery to be done, especially when it's transplants of the heart, kidneys and brain.With a tonne (metric) of achievements to keep the intensity on, and Team Fortress 2 characters joining the game for a special operation, Surgeon Simulator 2013 promises absolute hilarity, and that's just the main menu!

												You play a surgeon with the motor skills of a 2 year old. A trully truthful medical simulation that puts you in the spot of a doctor that got his doctorate degree from a plumbing school, with the benefit of using the same tools as a plumber. In the end the patient is either dead or horrible disfigured from ""your"" medical practise, but don't worry Bob knew what he was getting into. Anyone who plays this game has done the world a service and should be instantly awarded a first aid certificate.

												    Imagine performing surgery within a claw-crane toy vending machine.  The surgeon's single hand is, by design, one of the clumsiest manifestations of inter-activity ever published.  Of course this would be the very point and what makes it so much fun! The difficulty in getting anywhere because of this intentional disconnect with user input can, however, be frustrating at times.  I personally require a mouse pad the size of Central Park in order to move the arm around (even on the highest sensitivity).  It's definitely presented as a joke game, not an achievement or skill game, although those things are very much required to get anywhere.  There is no advice or direction in how to approach a given surgery, lots of bloody fun in the trial and error.  Too difficult to grasp objects in general, it can take an eon to get the scalpel in your hand at the right angle for incision.  Certainly not realisitic, and the title ""simulator"" here must be taken with a grain of salt.  Or a salt mine even.         On the positive, I totally knew what I was getting into and got a deal on the game anyway, so it's no travesty that's happened here.  The game really is pretty funny, and that seems to be it's greatest achievement.  I had  dreams of a more balanced mix of sim and parody...but got mostly the latter.           If  the hand were SLIGHTLY more dexterous, I would've enjoyed it more.  I'm sure it must be rewarding for true mouse-keteers that eventually hone their precision with the movements... that seems the only way to advance passed the first surgery even.  When the difficulty in progressing becomes more frustrating than fun, a game generally loses me.			"

												I was expecting a top-of-the-line learning tool for medical studies, but am bitterly disappointed that this game is nothing at all like real surgery.  I am shocked that they would even dare to call it a ""simulator"".  The representation of the human body and its organs is laughable at best, the surgical processes are simplified to crude hammering, slicing, dicing and flinging, and my ""hands"" act as if they're almost paralyzed, they're so cumbersome.  Jack the Ripper himself would scoff at this brutal mess of a ""game"".What could have been a helpful tool for the medical profession, and indeed for the betterment of humanity and the human condition, is reduced to outright nonsense.  Look elsewhere if you are seeking a valuable learning experience.  However, if utter mayhem involving helplesshuman bodies, all manner of blunt/sharp/shiny/pokey/breaky objects (medical and otherwise), and sheer unmitigated madness is your idea of a ""fun"" time, then perhaps this offering is for you, you sad and demented person.I know it's right up my street.9/10			"

												WHAT? A REVIEW AT 32 MINUTES??? Yep.WHAT THE HELL?'cause, I wanna' share.. now♥♥♥♥♥♥off or listen.Ok, this.. is.. funny!!!!! This game with its DLC is currently at 12$ USD and its worth it allready. I found it when I saw a friend post a pic about Ampu Tea.. both are the same genre... more or less.This game has really fun graphics.The start of the game in your office is funny in itself.The situation is funny.Organs flying around when you drop them is funny.Losing your watch, or dropping tools in the patient is funny.NEGATIVE: Its hard as hell. For me it was a BIG plus to remap my keys for my fingers... see, you control each finger individually with keys.. mine are a s d f, and your thumb is space. Mouse controls the up / down and forward / back. It will take some practice to not kill the patient, or  even finish the operation. SO: I am loving it. It actually stressed me out after two failed surgeries, so I took a step back. ( but laughing the whole time! ) Overall.. a good find IMO.			"

												Personally wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. The controls may be a novelty but honestly it just becomes tedious after the first 5 minutes. I spent the first few minutes not realising I was sitting on the main menu and the controls were not explained very clearly. The graphics are alright, not bad by any means, and the actual hilarity of whacking your patient with a hammer or accidentally injecting yourself with some type of drug was quite amusing, but doesn't make up for actual lack of gameplay as far as progression goes.Presentation: 6/10 - Didn't enjoy how the game was put together, there was no real title screen and the controls were written on a computer screen that I didn't notice for a while.Graphics: 8/10 - Didn't mind the graphics, but clunky and bland here and there though.Sound: 7/10 - Nothing wrong with them, but nothing really special about them either. The ""thunk"" as you hit someone in the face with a hammer was quite funny though.Gameplay: 4/10 - The gameplay is a novelty thing. It's cheesy as hell and becomes really tedious after a couple of minutes.Lasting Appeal: 6/10 - Don't see myself going back to this again.			"

												Like all good jokes, Surgeon Simulator 2013 knows when to stop. You could easily get through most of the content in an hour or two – something that the game's price prepares you for. The game is broken into three operations; heart transplant, kidney transplant and brain surgery. Once done, you'll get to do them all over again but in the back of an ambulance, where speed bumps and sharp turns constantly hurl your equipment around. Once your patient, Bob, has been ""patched up"" for the sixth time, you've seen most of the game. Although you do have the option to replay old stages to improve your previous time and rankings.			"

												Imagine, if you will, attempting to perform surgery with a neuromuscular disorder. That's Surgeon Simulator 2013 in a nutshell,You control the surgeon's arm. Yes, you're a one-armed surgeon apparently. Each finger is controlled by a corresponding key while the arm and hand itself is guided by the mouse. So far so good, right? Think again.Try pressing and holding all five keys, and if you're lucky, three of the fingers will close. Sometimes you can get all the fingers to cooperate, but often you end up trying to interact with little success. Assuming you can get the fingers, hand, and arm to function properly, you still have to deal with the awkward physics (drop a hammer and watch it bounce about like a basketball, often ending up on the floor where you can no longer retrieve it) and terribly clumsy object detection. Try to grab a scalpel, for instance, and you'll probably end up gripping it by the blade or be forced to contort your arm in various positions to simply make a small cut.The actual surgery itself pitiful in its implementation, You're barely given any equipment, and what little you have is mixed among ridiculous items. When you use your tools, the patient begins bleeding profusely and there's no way to cauterize wounds or inject atropine to deal with a dangerously low heart rate.All in all, SS2013 tries to be humorous and even make fun of itself, but the gimmick wears thin about 5 minutes into your first operation (if it hasn't already done so at the reception desk). You end up spending more time fighting with the controls to do anything rather than playing the actual game, and the task of surgery is really just an excuse to see how many horrible ways someone can be murdered on the operating table.Bottom Line: If you want a game that's essentially a one-trick pony and revolves around torture-disguised-as-surgery, I'd recommend buying Surgeon Simulator 2013 right away. On the other hand, if you want something that at least resembles modern medicine and surgical techniques -- or just doesn't require you to wrestle with the controls every step of the way -- you should do yourself a favor and skip this title entirely. Instead, try an old game (published in 1988) called ""Life and Death.""			"

												The physics, sound effects, and graphics are pretty good! And the physics are perfect for this kind of thing! I have fun, feeling like I'm a surgeon, working on people's internal organs. But my favorite part of this game is basically reenacting Meet The Medic, by ubercharging a baboon heart and replacing Heavy's heart with it!			"

												Like all good jokes, Surgeon Simulator 2013 knows when to stop. You could easily get through most of the content in an hour or two – something that the game's price prepares you for. The game is broken into three operations; heart transplant, kidney transplant and brain surgery. Once done, you'll get to do them all over again but in the back of an ambulance, where speed bumps and sharp turns constantly hurl your equipment around. Once your patient, Bob, has been ""patched up"" for the sixth time, you've seen most of the game. Although you do have the option to replay old stages to improve your previous time and rankings.			"

												Surgeon Simulator 2013 almost falls into the category of ""so bad it's good."" You play as a disembodied arm and are tasked to cut some bones, pull out some organs, and plop a replacement organ back in. It suffices to say that the word ""simulator"" in the title is meant to be tongue-in-cheek. There are three stages: a heart transplant, a kidney transplat, and a brain transplant (though, really, shouldn't it be called a ""body"" transplant?). After completing these stages, you repeat them in an ambulance which ups the difficulty. After you complete these in an ambulance, you repeat them again in space, which ups the difficulty a bit more. Late in the game there are a few bonus surgeries you can do on an alien, but I didn't have the patience to get this far.The main challenge of the game is mastering the awful controls, and there isn't much more to the gameplay besides that. Sure, there are some easter eggs to find, and the over-the-top ridiculousness of game keeps it from being too boring. But, still, I can't imagine most people bothering to play this for more than a few hours tops. So if can you get this game inexpensively, it is good for a cheap laugh. Other than that, it's not really worth playing.My rating: 2/5			"

												People will have absolutely differing opinions on Surgeon Simulator. On one hand, it is a very quirky and somewhat cathartic game: where else are you actually *encouraged* to permanently remove a person's lungs in order to do a heart transplant --- which is a simple matter of dropping that squishy-looking red blob into the open chest of a heavily anesthesized person.On the other hand, the controls are very difficult to get used to. They are really awkward, and you may find yourself cursing because you dropped the bone saw, so you would need to improvise by using, say, a hammer to break off ribs. This difficulty is the inherent appealing factor of the game, though, and there are many people who love it. I liked playing the game but only for a very short period of time.You will like this game if you liked playing that flash game named QWOP, where the horrible controls constitute the main game mechanic. In my opinion though, I would not recommend buying this game unless you are already absolutely certain you will enjoy this. I only had a minimal level of enjoyment because the novelty factor ran out for me fairly quickly, and soon became frustrated. I actually thought I would enjoy it a lot, because gameplay videos looked very fun, but fiddling around with the ""simple"" controls became a most arduous task, and ain't nobody got time for that!

I'd maybe recommend this game to other users if I could play all of the levels without having to beat any, since the controls are RUBBISH, I'm not sure why completing a level is necessary to advance.

												I was once a medical student at Harvard, and I am proud to announce I have successfully acheived my Master's degree. Now I am not normally much for gaming, but when I saw this ""Surgeon Simulator"" game on the medical forums, you can bet I was intriuged. I purchased it right away, thinking my medical background would give me the edge in the online community, and all the cool doctors would finally come to my parties. I was sorely mistaken, as before I could launch the game I got my fingers caught in a tabletop pencil sharpener and my hands were mangled beyond the repair of any surgery I could accomplish because my fingers were mangled beyond repair.

												Worthless waste of money. I'm disappointed I even gave these developers money in the Humble Bundle X. The closest thing you could call, a tutorial, in this game is a late 80s power point, that only tells you what all the controls do. There is no step by step, how to play the game. They just throw you into the first surgery with no instruction other than, ""Transplant this man's heart."" After attempting to pick up a saw, I stabbed my hand with a syringe, and proceeded to have an LSD trip. Now I’m tripping balls and have no clue what to do. I have now idea what the next step is, not even knowing what the first step was. I have no idea how to manipulate the controls to do anything, and I’m now tripping balls unable to see anything. ♥♥♥♥ this game.

Posted: February 8, 2014
												Surgeon Simulator 2013 is, essentially, a joke. It's a funny joke when played on somebody else, but somehow loses much of the humor when it happens to you.The root of the joke is that this is a surgery game with difficult controls. Which could be kind of funny, on its own. But there's so much else piled on top of that, that it makes the game less amusingly frustrating, and more the regular kind of frustrating. The physics are buggy, for one. Your hand gets stuck in EVERYTHING, and sometimes items go flying with little provocation. Sometimes things just fall out of your hand, even though you had a strong grip on them. 2-1 odds it damages the patient and/or falls on the floor. Nothing is really explained at the start, which is all part of the joke. But the game could at least tell you that the green shot stops bleeding, because your average player is going to have a VERY rough go of it without that knowledge.One of the biggest issues for me was figuring out where to cut things. You can't just cut something wherever. You have to cut at a very precise location or you're just wasting the patient's valuable blood. Even knowing where to cut doesn't always help. I know where to cut the left side of the large intestine, but I always wind up scraping my blades all over the thing before it finally gives way. The bigger-picture problem here is that the game is just finicky. Putting a replacement organ where it belongs doesn't always ensure the end of the level. Oftentimes - especially with the kidneys - you can find yourself knocking the organ(s) all around, just trying to get it/them to register as properly in place.There are only three main surgeries in the game. These are the heart transplant, a double kidney transplant, and a brain transplant which is always unlocked last even though it's honestly the easiest of the three. When you complete one, you unlock the next one, and when you complete all three, you unlock the next location. Initially, you only have to perform the operations in an OR. Then you must repeat them in a speeding ambulance, which is even more difficult than that sounds. After that, you must do them a third time in outer space with no gravity. All of these extra locations are just ways to cover up the lack of totally unique operations and draw more laughs out of the original joke, which ran out of laughs the moment you failed your first ambulance mission.And that's sort of my point. It's not that funny to PLAY Surgeon Simulator. It's vastly more fun to watch somebody else play Surgeon Simulator, and let them rage so you don't have to.There are two bonus surgeries which were added on later. One follows the ""Meet the Medic"" video from the Team Fortress 2 universe, and is available from the start. You play the Medic, and you must operate on the Heavy. It is essentially a more complex and difficult version of the basic heart transplant, with a TF2 theme permeating it. The other is actually an intriguing and completely unique surgery, but is only unlocked after you have already completed the three main surgeries in all three locations, so I won't be playing that one as I just don't have the patience to reach it.Surgeon Simulator contains a load of amusing easter eggs and has a good sense of humor about itself. Aesthetically, it is actually quite nice. Everything looks great and sounds great. When you're on a roll, everything even feels great. Shimmying a lung or brain out of a patient is a pleasing experience. It's just not pleasing enough to warrant shelling out the cash for the few operations available and all of the frustration you're sure to endure.Surgeon Simulator is an interesting game. It's certainly different. It can even, on rare occasions, be genuinely fun. I don't want to call it terrible, because it's not. But I feel like the joke is lost on the player. Maybe if it had cooperative play so that two players could watch each other bumble and laugh mutually together at each other's misfortune, it would be more fun to experience firsthand. But it doesn't, and so I can't recommend spending your own money on it. But I can absolutely recommend watching somebody else play it on YouTube.			"

												This game is either very bad or I am the clumsiest guy in the world.Nevermind the surgeries,I tried for like 15 minutes to put the damn tape into the VCR,with no success.If there is something I fail to understand,I wish that the game had a more in-depth tutorial.Maybe I'm too stupid to get this game...or maybe that is exactly what the  developers counted on,in order to get away with an awfully tought out control system.I mean what is this? One develops a game witch is nearly impossible to control ,and expect me to be joyful about it?Am I suppose to laugh at my failures? I don't need a videogame for this.I'm married with children . Maybe I should cry for my wasted time and money.			"

												It's just not worth the money. Fingers do not respond properly to keyboard mapping and the arm movements are overly imprecise compared to mouse movements, especially disturbing in rotation movement. I was hoping to have some fun failing surgery but since the disconnect between what the arm does and the controls I have to achieve what I want, the concept falls apart. Useless controls makes for a worthless game.			"

There are barely any instructions, no tutorial, and nothing to even indicate the requirements for completing a goal. Glitches and bad design decisions make it difficult and unclear how to proceed, and finnicky goal conditions mean you can do everything required but still fail for no reason. Okay, I'm supposed to do a heart transplant - I've put the new heart in, why aren't I winning? Do I need to do something else?

												A game where basically the entire focus is trying to complete medical operations through the use of absolutely terrible controls that tend to make you screw up alot. And while this can be kinda funny for a time, eventually you will want to actually complete the content that is in the game. And if you want that, the controls are a ♥♥♥♥ing nightmare.Some people somehow manage to get past these controls and actually manage to finish some of the levels in this game. I am not one of those people. I don't have the patience for this particular brand of annoyance.This game may be fun for someone, but not for me. So it gets a solid ""no"". This ""game"" isn't worth it.			"

They are realeasing new content and we cant even play it because we dont have the ♥♥♥♥ing anniversary edition...Anniversary my♥♥♥♥♥they just found a random day called it a&e so they can make more money...♥♥♥♥ you guys...3rd and most importand its ""versatility""....You do one surgery you do another one and thats pretty much it...There is no variation at all...Yes there are various tools that you can use but very few are quite good and usefull...And the controls dont help with that...You are boing to be bored by this game eventually and you are likely to regret your money..Overall i think this game has potential but for now it cant offer much....Its fun but its stupid,....Its popular but its boring after a while....For me, just wait for a discount or dont buy it at all....

												I enjoyed what Surgeon Simulator had to offer. It is challenging and often frustrating but that takes nothing away from the messy fun that is Surgeon Simulator. After all its not often you can play a drugged, negligent, maybe cannibal surgeon. But remember if you're not hammering away at a rib cage, or dropping office supplies in a poor most likely soon to be dead patient you just might be doing surgery wrong.			"

												Surgeon Simulator 2013 is an oddball. Hilarity will undoubtedly ensue as you fumble around with the intentionally awkward controls, making the game great to play with a few friends standing behind you. Once you get the handle behind it, though, it becomes clear pretty quickly that the game doesn't have much substance beyond that initial laugh factor. The game's actual content is very limited, pretty much only including three procedures, which you can do in a few different environments (table, ambulance, space) to mix up the physics slightly. Even then, each of the three procedures is just one form or another of ""smash some bones, take out organ, put new organ in"".Surgeon Simulator 2013 isn't necessarily a bad game (even if it is going for the ""so-bad-it's-awesome"" aesthetic with the terrible controls), but it certainly is a limited one. It's worth grabbing on sale for a few quick laughs. Otherwise, the game really just offers too little to be worthwhile.			"

												Okay as a timewaster. Got it cheap, and even I am starting to regret this purchase. The collision is absolutely terrible in this game. Stuff clips through your hands, you can clip the lungs straight through the ribcage because it is so terrible. I have accidentally instant-killed a patient  because a tool clipped through the skull and got stuck inside the brain instead of breaking the exterior in the brain transplant operation. This severely lessens the fun, as you have little control on what mistakes you make. The force required to break bones also seems terribly inconsistent. Bonus points subtracted for pulling a petty publicity stunt with this trump stuff. Lelelele edgy political satire. It has obviously crossed a line. This isn't just run of the mill parody... this is just straight up harassment. This game is a neat idea, but it works extremely badly. I can not reccomend this.			"

Probably realized they'd scare potential customers off with insane amounts of problems this game has if people had a place to come talk about those problems.			"

												This game is escapism turned up to 11. Use two hands IRL and half your keyboard space, plus your mouse, just to control one hand that doesn't even have a full motion range. Sound ridiculous? It is. Oh so hilariously ridiculous...This is a game for those with a very broad sense of humour, or a well-hidden sadistic streak. When you tear out Bob's lung with a hammer, you have to either laugh, vomit or smile inwardly with sadistic glee. If you chose option one or three, then Surgeon Simulator is well worth the pricetag. If you chose option 2.... then don't watch the trailers.The gameplay is really really hard to describe adequately; but it's like the drinking game version of the boardgame ""Operation"". Basically, you're taking bits out of Bob (all three patients are apparently named Bob), and then you put a couple of bits back in. All on two time limits - an actual clock, and the ""hard limit"" of how much blood Bob can phyiscally lose before he/it dies. And Bob will die a lot. Sometimes you'll even get an achievement for killing him. But there are a lot of ""oh great the drill is stuck in him, I'd better get the hammer to pull it out... great, now the hammer is stuck too, hand me the circular saw"". Eventually you get an understanding of how each tool works and how each body part works; and after a messy time learning all these things you can start performing surgical feats. This game requires a mix of thought, motor skills, practice and patience. The patients, fortunately, are provided - make no mistake, if you tried performing surgeries in this manner IRL you *would* be going away for a long time. In fact, the thing you can leave at the door is realism - a working knowledge of anatomy may be helpful; but I'm thinking more of the kind of knowledge a butcher has than that of a medical professional. If you are a medical professional, leave all that Hippocratic Oath and ""duty of care"" stuff behind in Surgeon Simulator; at least to begin with. One day it will come in useful as you make precision moves to complete the surgery, but in the early days it's just a case of beating and stabbing the internal organs around until they fall out.I do reccomend this game as a casual, light-hearted bit of entertainment. Some people may like to take it further and develop the skills to be a ""pro surgeon"", but a lot more players will just enjoy stabbing poor Bob with a drill. And that's an entirely valid way to play Surgeon Simulator; you can get all your money's worth and more out of that kind of slapstick ""hmm I wonder what happens when I..."" messing around.			"

												This is a story about how I started my surgeon career.I was a manchild and I was sitting in my basement and doing a surgeries, after some time I decided to try to become a real surgeon, I've drived to the hospital and got in the surgery room and I said ""F*ck off doctor, I'll do it!"" so I grabbed a chainsaw and removed the bones, grabbed a scalpel and removed everything except his heart (I threw everything else to trash because he doesn't need this ffs) and removed it, I killed a doctor and removed his heart to replace the patients heart (I just threw it inside of him), the patient was so happy that he couldn't even get up and open his eyes.And that's how I got my surgeon career.Also 10/10 made my life better.

												My only big complaint is that IMO, A&E Edition ruins the game's pacing with the extreme amount of levels it adds. Tooth surgery and eye surgery means that there's too much work to do in order to get to additional levels.However, overall this game's pretty good and probably the best the ironic simulator genre has ever pushed out. People who tell you the controls suck haven't spent enough time with the game. These controls are very much masterable and once you get used to them you can perform all kinds of stuff. It's like saying Toribash has bad controls; it doesn't, it just has unusual controls with a high learning curve. Get past that learning curve and you can do ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ninja flips and advanced wrestling moves.If you're desperately looking at a ""simulator"" game that will actually keep you entertained for more than five minutes, Surgeon Sim is definitely for you. Unlike a legion of other games in its genre, your actions have consequences on your environment, it doesn't solely rely on the ""haha funny physics and dumb controls"" joke to carry the humour, and above all else Surgeon Sim has an actual game buried under the madness.

												The controls are incredibly difficult to use and with no tutorial on how to complete the tasks you are presented you will find yourself fighting the controls more than the challenge of the game. Perhaps if you have the VR support the game says it offers and can use your own hand instead of the clunky ""control every axis of movement with just the mouse"" hand controls it might be playable. The game's own controls should not be the most difficult aspect of the game.			"

												I could not want to play this game less.After getting use to the loose (read: gimmicky) controls, you enter into you first surgery, a heart transplant. Step 1: crack open the rib cage as destructively as possible while also not causing massive internal hemoraging. While not causing your patient to bleed out is simple enough, cracking a rib cage with a hammer (or the less preferred bonesaw or dremmel) by controlling a flimsy wrist with the x and y axis on the mouse is frusturating and, worse, boring, By my fifth try, I made it to the heart with my patient losing blood only at 3ml/s, but I felt nothing. No risk, no fun, and no pride in managing to become familiar with bad controls that were intentionally created to be bad.It's like Demon Souls...if it were programmed by the old Titus team that made Superman 64.Wait until it's on sale for $1 USD and then make sure you don't need that dollar for a pack of chips from a vending machine.

												This game is terrible, I had to uninstall it. First of all, the controls are terrible even for a game made in 2013. Second, there is a lot of humour which pertains to hurting people, which makes you a sociopath. So if someone put the brain scanners all over your head and put a video of people getting hurt, your pleasure centers on the scanner would light up, you sick person. Third of all this game is just a meme, it should not have made any money if it weren't for jewtube users wanting those advertising dollars playing this quirkey game. ""Oh, it's so random and quirkey! I have a picture of PewDiePie on my desk! And I am a loser who has never had a serious thought in my life!"" (real quote from amatuer jewtuber). This game is garbage.			"

												I could not want to play this game less.After getting use to the loose (read: gimmicky) controls, you enter into you first surgery, a heart transplant. Step 1: crack open the rib cage as destructively as possible while also not causing massive internal hemoraging. While not causing your patient to bleed out is simple enough, cracking a rib cage with a hammer (or the less preferred bonesaw or dremmel) by controlling a flimsy wrist with the x and y axis on the mouse is frusturating and, worse, boring, By my fifth try, I made it to the heart with my patient losing blood only at 3ml/s, but I felt nothing. No risk, no fun, and no pride in managing to become familiar with bad controls that were intentionally created to be bad.It's like Demon Souls...if it were programmed by the old Titus team that made Superman 64.Wait until it's on sale for $1 USD and then make sure you don't need that dollar for a pack of chips from a vending machine.

												First time i saw this, i was like: WANT! i have no regrets. You will find the most humorous ways to operate people that may or may not result into eminent death. ""Dammit, i lost my saw in his chest."" or ""I can't get the drill out of his stomach!"" and even ""I didn't know tomahawks were approved brain surgery equipment, awesome!"" are common quotes of people playing this game. like humor? like blood? like tearing out vital organs and replacing some by stuff not found in the average body? get this game.

												This is brilliant! You take the role as a.. Let's say, not-so-well skilled doctor. By that i mean, you'll be put into a surgery where you have to do, let's say a heart transplant. The controls are a, w, e, r, space and mouse. Just like a real hand. Sounds easy? No.. It's not.. That's the thing about this game. It's really difficult to control the hand, and that makes it indeed funny.I totally recommend this game! The only cons would be, that it lacks different types of scenarios. (There's heart transplant, kidney transplant and brain transplant with a few different modes). And you really have to be careful about blood-loss, but that's the fun part too.As i said.. I recommend it, and you should already be buying it right now!			"

												Unfortunately I went into this with something totally different in mind.  I can definitely see the appeal for anyone who likes to kill time (no pun intended) doing infuriatingly difficult -- though somewhat entertaining -- tasks.  Was I expecting an *actual* surgical simulation? No, not really; and to be honest the sound and blood effects are pretty entertaining on their own.  I guess ultimately my disappointment arises from the fact that the sole purpose of the game really seems to be simply the fact that the surgeon's hand is incredibly imprecise and difficult to control.  Yes, I can see to some degree the comedic value of accidentally knocking a jar into the patient's chest cavity or stabbing them in the heart when you meant to cut their esophagus, but at some point I had to ask myself, ""Am I playing this because I like fighting the game's insistence on not doing what I'm trying to control the hand to do, or because I like figuring out how best to perform the surgery and manage blood loss?"" I will tell you that the game overwhelmingly shifts toward the former, and I realized that the vast majority of the time wasn't spent figuring out how to do the surgery and keep the patient alive, but simply and almost solely trying to control the surgeon himself.  I got about halfway through before I decided I was tired of fighting the game itself rather than actually playing it.  I guess I don't understand why the devs decided to put all the effort into developing decent graphics, sound effects, music, interface, etc., then phone it in on the controls.If the point is the lack and difficulty of control, then I guess that wasn't something I understood going into it.  So if a game based on fighting with the controls to manipulate an extremely difficult to maniuplate broken robotic quasi surgeon hand, then this game is for you.  If that sounds like it would be a bit frustrating and unfulfilling, you'll want to pass on this game.  I can assure you, the comedic value quickly gets replaced with frustration, annoyance, and regret at having spent the money.6/10 "

												If you can figure out how to even pick anything up, you have more patience than me.  I should have taken the video preview as more of a hint that it was simply a player fighting against poor controls to brush aside things in front of them.  It doesn't matter what environment you end up in front of, prepare to be the an arm that loves to always return to the same vertical position unless you contantly press the left mouse button to bob it up and down, flailing like a monkey, knocking all mugs and scalpals inside the chest cavity of whatever sucker ended up on your shift.Luckily, I only played $5.  It might be worth it, but I'm renaming it arm simulator 2013.  Don't think I'll be back in 2014 unless they add a leg.			"

Simply my favorite game since its release!Even after so many years this game still makes me laugh and still brings me a challenge, I always end up playing it again from time to time.It's a funny game, its control difficulties are what makes this game interesting, always being a challenge no matter what.Cartoony graphics to avoid players grossing out while playing, it's simply one of the funniest and most well-made simulators you can find out there.It features:Rage-induncing controls!Many surgery types and levels!Lots of achievements and challenges!Secrets and even ARGs! (more than you would expect)Some actual story/backstory.Gore and Blood (?)Puns, lots of puns.Lots of DLC to keep the game fresh!Someone that just won't stop calling you.Hand-signs support! (not really)Unconscious Trump!Overall: 10/10I would recommend this game to everyone that likes medicine, it clearly isn't a game to accurately simulate a surgery, but it's always worth to visit it sometimes to have a little break out of those stressful jobs involving the art of healing.

												Well this game seemed awsome at 1st... then i ended up raging at it... here are some reason to witch i dont recommend this game.1. Default finger layout (i can only use 3 or 4 fingers)2. Cuting bones makes the pacient lose blood (if i remember correctly, bones ARE HARD AND DONT HAVE BLOOD IN THEM)3. Mouse1 to lower and raise (75% of the times i try to pick things up, i miss)4. The watch, WHY THE HELL IS IT THERE? YOU'LL END UP WITHOUT IT NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO, so my question, WHY IS IT THERE?5. No horizontal hand move, (not being able to only move the hand, not the whole arm)6. Full of glitchs, want proof?

												Were this a ""calm player-objective driven sandbox"" game where you could be fooling around for the most part, I could recommend this ""game"" to be purchased.However, what we have in hands is actually something that tries to be as ""arcade"" (read: pick-it-up-and-play-for-the-high score) as possible; and for the most part there is also only single solution, because of reason called ""developers dictated so""...Controls aside, which have been already bashed enough already by others, there are some far more ""bugger"" issues with this title.It all mainly comes down to both the limitation where hand/player can go around and the level layouts:Were one to drop the needed ""ingredient"" or tool into floor, there is no way to retrieve these aside restarting the stage / ""murdering"" the patient. Same thing happens when you accidentally push items far too away from your reach when ""magnet""-fingers of the player-hand fails to ""activate"".Then there are simply the item-layout causing huge problems when trying to achieve the main goal; either player-hand cannot be lowered enough due wrist boking into something and halting the decent. Or otherwise there are solid non-movable object preventing the operations itself.The much advertised ""Meet the Medic""-stage is guilty of all the unplayability faults mentioned (and many other faults): Good luck All in all, I certainly don't recommending to buy this game (at least alone).But otherwise if for some reason one gets this game to their collection, I for one certainly hope the player is going to face less of the bugs and such (Use bonesaw on ribcage -> lungs phase through <- ribcage still being intact, to name latest bugs I encountered alongside scalpel-immune innards).On a random side-note, I've yet to still see or hear any other surgeon-sections or whole games that actually are not only more or less realistic, but fun to do than ""Life & Death""-series (flawed, and certainly far too ahead its time) and that one ""mini-game"" in ""Chaos Break"" (which for goodness sake was sort of like more-actiony ""Resident Evil"", but with non-Earth-invading-cretures (and first introduction to sudokus to me (*I was doing sudokus way before they were cool*)).I can always keep wishing and forget that ""Trauma Center""-series was a thing (aside music of course, but that's the ""unfortunate"" thing with various not-so-good-things; music alone for the most part is far better than the product it was shipped with)...

												I am going to reccomend this game, but it just barely made it. It has too crappy controls, EVEN if you change them. There's just no good setup. The physics in this game are kind of realistic, but the operations are just non-realistic. The doctors would never hold a heart in thier BARE HANDS. They never even show Nyjuel wash them. But that's enough ranting about SS2013. This is a pretty fun game.Was it worth the 10 bucks? Yes. There are so many cool easter eggs, stuff to do with the floppy disks, and I like *SPOILER ALERT* Meet the medic >:)I'd reccomend this game. It's really popular with youtubers for a reason. (P.S.

												Surgeon Simulator is definitely an ""experience"". Most will likely find this game rather shallow and pointless, but as-it-is can be quite fun. I personally came into very skeptical but once booted I realized time had flown by and I was hooked messing around in someones body as chunks, bones, and tools went flying aroudn the roomMy biggest frustration didn't reside with the completely intentionally absurd controls, but with the total lack of instruction of what to do next to perform a ""surgery"". Even passing the first surgery was a struggle only because it wasn't clear what was needed to be done. Maybe this was intentional, but on top of the wacky control system, this added an unneccesarry challenge I believe.This will definetly not be a game for everyone, but if you have spare time and want to try something way out of left field, it can be worth a go for a bit. Don't expect it to be a long term satisfying game though.			"

												I don't...I can't...*sobs uncontrollably*So many things clipping into other things. Of course, this game is a novelty - Yes, I've barely played it.The ratio of positive to negative reviews is such that I decided to make mine negative (but NOT simply because of that ratio); this is a novel game, I applaud the idea behind it. No doubt, those who check out Surgeon Simulator would understand the premise (though they can hardly appreciate it until they play it... I certainly wasn't prepared, even after having watched a few videos of gameplay) - for those who don't: You control a ("")surgeon's("") arm - You can raise, lower and rotate the limb and control each digit individually - You are meant to manipulate objects in the most ham-handed of ways to perform the most delicate of procedures - Hilarity/Frustration/Joy/Rage-Induced-Nausea ensues. If it wasn't for the fact that EVERYTHING is derpy, and not just the controls, I would have recorded this as a Thumbs Up. Just in the half hour I played, though, I kept finding my surgical tools getting stuck in-between and behind ribs that I had yet to (be able to) break (hadn’t even lowered the arm manually). That knife was unavailable until I was able to articulate another tool appropriately to free that first tool… and then the damn knife flew away upon clashing with the hammer (really, that much momentum?). The height of the arm is too finicky, as is the angle at which you hold your wrist. It could go either way: A surgeon would keep their appendage steady - This game is intentionally hard to control. The game could have cut us SOME slack - Where's the fun/challenge in that? Such pleasure still escapes me... understand, though, that entertainment is constant. During my first attempt at the heart-transplant, all of my tools somehow flew off the table (IS THERE NO WAY TO TURN OFF THE DREMEL?!), so I simply beat my patient to death with the clock, to try again... to fail thrice more.I (want to) like this game(‘s idea). I will continue to play it - in short spurts, as that is the extent of my patience with it. Provided I can eventually reckon the mechanics/necessary ("")exploits(""), I might change the Negative to Positive and add a Zen statement or two to urge others to stick with it. As it is, I wouldn't feel right Recommending it, because of just HOW extremely, er, unintuitive your interactions within the OR are - how SPASMODIC the integrity of the objects within the environment is.

												Unfortunately I went into this with something totally different in mind.  I can definitely see the appeal for anyone who likes to kill time (no pun intended) doing infuriatingly difficult -- though somewhat entertaining -- tasks.  Was I expecting an *actual* surgical simulation? No, not really; and to be honest the sound and blood effects are pretty entertaining on their own.  I guess ultimately my disappointment arises from the fact that the sole purpose of the game really seems to be simply the fact that the surgeon's hand is incredibly imprecise and difficult to control.  Yes, I can see to some degree the comedic value of accidentally knocking a jar into the patient's chest cavity or stabbing them in the heart when you meant to cut their esophagus, but at some point I had to ask myself, ""Am I playing this because I like fighting the game's insistence on not doing what I'm trying to control the hand to do, or because I like figuring out how best to perform the surgery and manage blood loss?"" I will tell you that the game overwhelmingly shifts toward the former, and I realized that the vast majority of the time wasn't spent figuring out how to do the surgery and keep the patient alive, but simply and almost solely trying to control the surgeon himself.  I got about halfway through before I decided I was tired of fighting the game itself rather than actually playing it.  I guess I don't understand why the devs decided to put all the effort into developing decent graphics, sound effects, music, interface, etc., then phone it in on the controls.If the point is the lack and difficulty of control, then I guess that wasn't something I understood going into it.  So if a game based on fighting with the controls to manipulate an extremely difficult to maniuplate broken robotic quasi surgeon hand, then this game is for you.  If that sounds like it would be a bit frustrating and unfulfilling, you'll want to pass on this game.  I can assure you, the comedic value quickly gets replaced with frustration, annoyance, and regret at having spent the money.6/10 "

												I never write lenghty reviews for any game, but I feel like I need to write this in case I can spare at least one person from this horrible piece of software the developpers call a game. Seriously, Do not buy it.Like others have pointed out before me, this game is just a gimmick- You buy it, say ""haha I'm performing surgery"", and then you probably move on. You wont get your money's worth if you intend to just♥♥♥♥♥♥around like this and you're probably better off watching videos or something. If, on the other hand, you're the type of person who will try to get all achievements and unlockables like myself, the only thing you will get from this game is frustration and a lot of headache; This game controls horribly and if you play for more than an hour you will realize that the success of every operation will likely be the result of random luck or some unhealthy amount of time trying to acquire muscle memory.I don't mind putting in a lot of work in order to beat hard games but this isn't NES megaman difficulty or anything, this is just a studio trying to pass off a bad game with a bad physics engine as a challenge. It's the biggest offense of all in my opinion, because the developpers have the audacity to claim in their FAQ that this game is hard because they wanted people to feel ""rewarded"" for being able to put up with something they didn't even have to program. This game is just you struggling with some very bad physics for hours on end.It says a lot when the most famous works by Bossa studios is this joke of a game and a haha2funnylol game about bread. It's as unoriginal as it seems and you're better off steering clear of this abomination. And I don't understand the people who will try to defend it because there is no reason to play doctor's advocate here, it's just a bad game. Believe me. I'm not writing this for myself or for the developpers (since I'm sure they made mad $$$ from this already), but for YOU who hasn't bought this game yet and can still get something way better on the steam store. You're better off buying doom or something. Seriously, don't buy this, go buy something else. Even if you're into goofy stuff, you're better off playing the game where you shower with your dad and a bunch of naked guys than this.PS: It also seems as if there is an issue with mouses for this game, so if you plan on playing this on a laptop or with certain types of mouses you won't be able to grab an item and lower the hand at the same time which is pretty necessary to complete ANY of the operations, so be ready to potentially have to buy a wired mouse because of this one game.

												This game seems really awesome because of how much control you have in controlling the hand and fingers, however once you actually start dealing with collision the items in your hands do odd behavior and go out of control. It is very difficult to pick things up at first but you adapt or give up (which I highly recommend, getting skilled at manipulating the wrist and fingers is not enough) but even when you get a handle on picking things up it throws a curve ball and the fact that somethings are lying flat and others are not causes major issues; for instance there is no way to pick up a surgical knife and rotate so that it is cutting at an angle or if you wanna cut horizontal so you hold it with your thumb and pointer and can add the middle finger doesn't matter but you will have to angle your wrist down like a t-rex and start jerking your hand around hoping its cutting the arteries but you can't see because your hand blocks the view. Its complete crap and people just struggle even getting past the first level.			"

												This is brilliant! You take the role as a.. Let's say, not-so-well skilled doctor. By that i mean, you'll be put into a surgery where you have to do, let's say a heart transplant. The controls are a, w, e, r, space and mouse. Just like a real hand. Sounds easy? No.. It's not.. That's the thing about this game. It's really difficult to control the hand, and that makes it indeed funny.I totally recommend this game! The only cons would be, that it lacks different types of scenarios. (There's heart transplant, kidney transplant and brain transplant with a few different modes). And you really have to be careful about blood-loss, but that's the fun part too.As i said.. I recommend it, and you should already be buying it right now!			"

												This is the most amazingly stupid game I've ever played. I feel dumber having played it, my hands hurt after I quit. I have yet to sucessfully complete a surgery without murdering the patient. It's awesome!			"

												This game teases me, it pesters me, it infuriates me, and it hates me.  But dammit, i like it.  It's hard, tedious, and rage inducing, but it's fun to kill the patient.  10/10 for killing Bob.			"

												YES! Recommended. I bought it just to try it out (I tried a flash or java version can't remember before it was released on steam) but I got addicted and finished it in two days got every achievement in a double session of 6 hours each session.Very funny, nice details, nice little secrets here and there (exploration) that can go unseen if you are not careful. Also, it is based on achievements....the surgical procedures would not be challenging or interesting if you don't have any challenge. So remember to check the achievements to be get the real challenge and be the best (fake) surgeon out there.			"

												I broke a man named Bob's ribs with a hammer, ripped out his lungs and slapped him in the face with them, cut his stomach out and threw it out of the back of an ambulance into the street (and then proceeded to put his esophogus on his neck like a scarf), stabbed him in the eye numerous times with a needle that stopped his bleeding, shook his head around (and got an achievement), removed his old heart by throwing a bonesaw in his chest, and tossed the new heart in and was told the surgery was complete, all while using only my left hand.    53/10 this game has taught me all I needed to know about being a surgeon.

												I am going to reccomend this game, but it just barely made it. It has too crappy controls, EVEN if you change them. There's just no good setup. The physics in this game are kind of realistic, but the operations are just non-realistic. The doctors would never hold a heart in thier BARE HANDS. They never even show Nyjuel wash them. But that's enough ranting about SS2013. This is a pretty fun game.Was it worth the 10 bucks? Yes. There are so many cool easter eggs, stuff to do with the floppy disks, and I like *SPOILER ALERT* Meet the medic >:)I'd reccomend this game. It's really popular with youtubers for a reason. (P.S. CONTROLS TAKE GETTING USED TO)			"

												Surgeon Simulator is definitely an ""experience"". Most will likely find this game rather shallow and pointless, but as-it-is can be quite fun. I personally came into very skeptical but once booted I realized time had flown by and I was hooked messing around in someones body as chunks, bones, and tools went flying aroudn the roomMy biggest frustration didn't reside with the completely intentionally absurd controls, but with the total lack of instruction of what to do next to perform a ""surgery"". Even passing the first surgery was a struggle only because it wasn't clear what was needed to be done. Maybe this was intentional, but on top of the wacky control system, this added an unneccesarry challenge I believe.This will definetly not be a game for everyone, but if you have spare time and want to try something way out of left field, it can be worth a go for a bit. Don't expect it to be a long term satisfying game though.			"

												This game is like one of those cheap gag gifts in spencers. Sure it looks cool, a rubber chicken, but what are you going to do with it 5 minutes from now? There's not much you can do with it. It's pretty boring. ALl of its appeal comes from ""OH THE BUTTONS ARE SO WACKY"" and then the novelty falls flatter than day-old beer.			"
