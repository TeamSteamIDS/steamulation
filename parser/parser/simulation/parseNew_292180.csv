												Ok, so i have to weigh in on this debate between what sims are the best. Firstly, about me, I am a real life pilot, and hold FAA and EASA commercial pilot licences (USA and European), EASA PPL Flight Instructor, and i am a gamer.About the game: its not a game. its a flight simulation software. do not buy if you are looking for a ""fun game to mess around on and earn steam acheivments etc etc"", nor will it teach you how to fly planes or anything of the sort. there is no arcade mode, there are no leaderboards, there are no charachter perks etc.About the flight simulation programme: I first had my taste of flying a plane on Microsoft Flight Simulator 95 (or 98, i forget) on a crappy little PC with a keyboard and mouse. as i grew up and my interest grew and flight sims developed, i hopped from flight sim to flight sim and i have played ALOT of different ones, and in my proffesional training, i have even used things like lockheed martin's Prepar3D flight simulator with full 737 and A320 cockpit mock ups. For home simming, i dont think anything beats XP10 though. I will be drawing comparisons in my review with 1 other game which this is often compared to - FSX (Microsoft Flight Simulator X/10) (im not even going to compare against ""Microsoft Flight"", that sim was pathetic....)The differencesFSX is a flight simulator, and a game in one package. it can both teach you how to fly a plane (atleast the basics) and give you fun missions to complete and rewards you with in game acheivments. It also is able to replicate, rather well, realistic flight dynamics and aircraft performance. however, i feel that FSX is a bit more buggy, alot less ""modable"" (free 3rd party aircraft were difficult to install in my opinion) and it feels a bit outdated. XP10 is, i have to admit, a little less user friendly. the menus and interface do not seem as polished etc, but boy is there alot you can do. Free 3rd party aircraft are relatively easy to install, a multitude of plugins exist that you can download, such as ground vehicle tows to push your aircraft back from the stands etc and there just seems to be alot more freedom in the game. Carrier landings for example. FSX, it was very long winded, very procedural, and a bit tedious if you ""just wanted to have a go at planting the damn plane on a deck"". and with only the F18 to chose from, it was a bit bland. with XP10, even though the scenario would be unrealistic, i can just load a boeing 747 and click ""land on a carrier"" and try landing a jumbo on a nimitz carrier.  Weather is very customizable, and can download real time actual weather with a click of a button which is pretty cool.Loads more stock aircraft to chose fromloads of different scenarios (i believe you can fly on mars if you wanted, that is atleast true of my experience on XP7,8 and 9 so i assume its on 10 too) You can try and bring down a space shuttle from orbit, and many other things that FSX just cant do with the base programme.Yes there are issues, yes some of the stock 3D cockpits are a bit naff and not done properly, but i have never really found it such a big deal. and if you want the true realism, be it on FSX or XP10, you wont fly stock aircraft anyway, you would go and buy 3rd party aircraft by proffesional 3rd party Devs that make accurate models and cockpits etc.you WILL need a joystick and rudder pedals, or at the minimum, a joystick with twist function for rudders. you can play with just a mouse, but lets be honest, that sucks. FSX you can play with a keyboard, but even then, joystick set up rules.so overall, what would i buy? both. i have both. i use them for totally different things. i use FSX and 3rd party payware aircraft and payware photo scenery to practice VFR aircraft navigation, and i use XP10 to practice aircraft procedures and general handling and flying, or to test myself in all sorts of different aircraft in different scenarious, like finding myself in a middle of thunderstorm in the middle of nowhere with various system failures. again, i would stress, XP10 is NOT a game. it features ""weapons"", where FSX does not, but these are only for novelty value. they do not replicate the actual fire control systems or anything like that. This is a flight sim that enthusiasts or proffesionals can use.If you are looking to buy your first flight sim or you want to learn how fly a plane, go and buy FSXIf you are looking for a world war 2 realistic flight sim where you can fire guns and down planes, go and get IL2 Sturmovik 1946 or Wings of PreyIf you are looking for a arcade combat flight sim, Tom Clancy's HawxIf you are looking for a realistic combat flight sim with modern fighters, get Lock Onif you are looking for a simulator to practice advanced things on, or experiment, or design your own creations and fly them (basic engineering knowledge required or willing to take the time to research how plane maker works), then this is the sim for you.edited 19/08/16 for spelling mistakes - it took me all this time since writing to find out i could edit! :D			"

												Full disclosure: I'm an actual licensed commercial pilot in Canada. I have about 15 hours of sim time in my logbook, 12 of which were on a commercial and Transport Canada-approved version of X-Plane (the other 3 were on Prepar3D, a version of FSX), and 10 of which applied to my license.This is a simulator, not a game. You can mess around with the fun fighters and experimental planes, but this is first and foremost a simulator. And what a simulator!If you're like me, you find fun in a challenging radionav approach. You find fun in managing system failures. You find fun in printing out checklists and having them next to you while handling the simulator. You find fun in education and a job well done. And this is where you get it. You can tweak the simulation accuracy, you can go from messing around doing aerobatics in a fictional plane, or you can turn your garage into a full-sized flight simulator. You can do all this in X-Plane 10, and it has the added bonuses of being more accurate, prettier, and less system-taxing than FSX. FSX is almost a decade old by now, is a RAM hog, hates graphics cards, is 32-bit, and is still slow and unoptimized. On my machine, it runs terribly. But X-Plane 10 has a 64-bit and 32-bit executable, supports multi-threading, is considerate of your RAM, and looks fantastic.I spent hundreds of hours with FS2004, FSX, and X-Plane 9. Thanks to them, my instrument and radionavigation training was easy. Thanks to them, I passed the infamous INRAT on my first try. This is a fantastic simulator, simply the best on the market, and the only one worth your money. I can fully recommend this for full price, and I'm a pennypincher.			"

												In many of the negative reviews of X-plane there seems to be a mismatch between the reviewers expectations and what X-plane is. If you're looking for aerial combat you'll be far better served by DCS World. Flight simulation whether you go FSX, P3D or X-plane is more hobby than a computer game. If you were going to get into model railways you may start with a small basic train set. If the bug bites, you soon want to add switches, scenery and new locomotives and stock. That's what x-plane is; a flight simulator starter set. You get a couple of basic aircraft, a sky and a barren planet (inhabited by only deer and birds). X-plane does itself a disservice with most of the included aircraft as they are far from representative of quality of aircraft that are available. X-plane's clouds are stonefish ugly. All the main simulators have pro's and con's. X-plane's smaller community is very committed and self reliant and there is a smorgasbord of freely available utilities and addon scenery. Some of which are pretty damn awesome considering they are free. You can get a very decent simulator experience with freeware alone. For sure, you will not minutely scratch the surface unless you're prepared to research and learn.  Personally I'd recommend budgeting for an addon aircraft in addition to X-plane. I'd suggest a Carenado HD aircraft, not because there aren't other worthy aircraft, just that if you are starting into X-plane, Carenado are consistently high quality and you're less likely buy something disappointing. If you want to go a bit further, Skymaxx Pro will fix X-plane's underwhelming skies.  Flight simulators may bore your socks off but they may also change your life. X-plane is a starting point for a hobby that may be with you for years.			"

												Here's my take on the civilian flightsim hobby as it currently stands: More than ever, it is a period of transition and I believe the future looks good. I have and use both FSX and X-Plane and therefore have a foot in both camps. It's a case of fully realized capabilities versus future potential. From another perspective I see one nearing the end of its 32-bit lifecycle and the other very much in its 64-bit adolescence.Background: I've been flight simming since SubLogic's C64 release, and have been firmly entrenched in the Microsoft FS camp on PC since FS5.1, although like everyone else in the day I had and used Flight Unlimited, FLY! and ProPilot. We loved the variety and happily used them all for what they had to offer. For me FS2004/FS9 was the watershed, and I was entrenched for a decade in the sim using all the familiar add-ons and a full suite of GoFlight hardware. Unfortunately my computer was firmly stuck in 2004 as well, so I avoided migrating to FSX. I was aware of and had messed around with XP during my biannual pilgrimage to Oshkosh, even chatting at length with Austin Meyer, but I was already too deeply invested in the MSFS camp. I'm certain that many can relate.I've been a licensed private pilot since 1991, with a multi-engine endorsement and lucky enough to have had exposure and stick time on some pretty cool equipment. Now as most real world guys will tell you, flying a computer is NOT the same - I don't care if the flight models are based on lookup tables or basic real-time elemental calculations, it's just not worth arguing over. Get over it.  Where there is tremendous value in simming however, is the 'process' of flight - planning, procedures, checklist habits, instrument scans, IFR approaches. For true immersion in the system look up PilotEdge and add that to your mix no matter what platform you fly.I was fortunate enough to finally build a cutting edge computer recently. As a treat, I picked up FSX-SE to see how she'd run on a modern box. Looked good and I was enthused enough to purchase Aerosoft's A320/321 (an absolutely excellent add-on BTW). Then the dreaded terrain.dll crashes started on flights lasting longer than about 60 minutes. While I understand these errors may have been largely addressed in the new FSX-SE beta patch, I am very grateful for them. They gave me pause and saved me the hundreds of $$ I was prepared to pour into the scenery and add-ons in order to bring it up to the available standards: Orbx, UTX, ASN, PMDG, et al. It's a slippery slope most know only too well, and when you finally stop and look back at all the resources you have dedicated, the thought of migrating to something totally new seems not only daunting, but is likely financially unwarranted as well.While waiting for a decade old piece of software to get patched by a third party so that I could run it on modern equipment and proceed to spend a great deal of money and tweaking time to get it to run correctly, the light bulb went on for me. Here I was at a crossroad and I was prepared to reinvest in the same old song and dance. Yes, it's the one tune everybody knows, but there was an opportunity to learn a new one. Even though I tried and failed to get the X-Plane demo working, I purchased the full version (10.35 currently) in order to give it an honest shakedown, flying it exclusively for a week. What that week gave me was an appreciation for just how immersive, smooth and realistic XP can be.I spent a good deal of time reading the related forums, familiarizing myself with the tips, tricks and FAQs. I found the stock 172 and Baron okay (certainly the equal of their stock FSX equivalents), but added the beautiful Carenado C340 for some GA flying. (Aside - the C340 is a nice looking package and I'm glad I have it but there are some unforgivable faults that required modifications to actually work - in particular the CDI when tuned to an ILS. Basic stuff. For shame.) Then the FlyJsim 737-200 for some good old fashioned radio navigation at jet speeds. Wonderful aircraft, beautifully modelled cockpit and convincingly realistic performance numbers. Definitely a pilot's plane. The coming IXEG 737-300 looks incredible. And I needn't mention that PMDG is developing for XP with a DC6 to be followed by one or more of their 7xx series...Sparse scenery? To me it looks far and away better than stock FSX. It's nicely scalable to the hardware you're running, and XP definitely makes proper use of modern hardware. The stock mesh is great, autogen works well, the road traffic is cool, and the night lighting is the stuff of pilot training heaven. But here's the kicker - there's so much freely available from the community. I've managed to populate my XP world with all the airport scenery I will be reasonably using with a few visits to the XP ORG. And if you have a look at what's possible using world2xplane... the future looks not only bright, but incredible. Need I mention no terrain.dll CTDs or OOM errors?Stock XP weather is in my opinion better than stock FSX. Dressed up with ASN and REX however, and FSX has a strong lead. But based on how close XP is getting with aircraft and scenery, the weather engine won't be far behind.Stock ATC is crap. But so is FSX's. Sorry, it's just not real. I alluded to it above, but try PilotEdge to see what real ATC is. Full stop.This has become a rather long piece, sorry about that. I suppose I felt I had a lot to say about where we've been, where we are, and where we're going. MSFS has been how it was, and largely how it is now (I include P3D here). Is it time for change? One platform is nearing a developmental dead end, albeit with some wonderful add-ons, and one is just beginning to realize its potential with continuous and meaningful support.I'll continue to use both platforms for now, I mean why not, I own both and enjoy each for what they offer. Let me be clear though - I will not be adding anything further to my FSX ecosystem, but will simply enjoy what I already have. FSX will be limited to getting my bus fix with that awesome Aerosoft A320, at least until the sim crashes with the latest .dll or OOM error. For the price of a decent FSX add-on, I would urge you to give XP a fair evaluation.In the end I see FSX as an old woman all gussied up in makeup and a new designer dress. She looks great and is pleasant to spend quality time with, but be careful if you go out dancing - she may fall and break a hip. Now have you seen the new girl in town? Dances funny, but she's smart, modern, and has some really cool moves. You may want to meet her.My future in the hobby is with XP. I know I am not alone. Developers take note.			"

												I'm not a real world pilot, though I do have 20 years and 5,000 hours as a navigator, telling pilots where to go. But I'm trying to find a good flight simulator in order to get some hands on to eventually get my private ticket. Anyway, I've owned FSX for years, tinkered with it some time ago, but heard overall good things about the physics model and visuals of X-Plane 10 and decided to try it.As far as the physics, I can't really say, it seems like the little Cessna flies okay, it's certainly a challenge to fly straight and level compared to FSX. And the visuals are better than FSX, though not as much as I expected given the relative ages of the sims.However, when it comes to real world flying, I find X-Plane seriously lacking in anything beyond slipping surlies VFR. The ATC is terrible, it's so frustrating to hear the scattering of AI planes being told ""NO2XP, you are off course"", literally every couple of second for several minutes on end. And apparently that's a bug that's been in the game for at least 2 years, according to the forums. And trying to follow the ATC instructions on the ground is a serious exercise in futility. I think of the 4 times I tried to get clearance, then taxi to the runway, then get clearance to take off, then successfully transition to an enroute center, I had 1 complete success, 1 partial success, and 2 serious failures.There never seem to be more than 2 or 3 other aircraft anywhere in range of mine, and they always have the same call signs, the call signs are a minor annoyance, the lack of other traffic seems pretty lacking compared to FSX.So this is sort of a mixed review, really. If you want pretty visuals and just flying around on your own, X-Plane 10 will probably satisfy you. If you want to learn  instrument flying, and dealing with ATC, flight planning, clearances and all the other parts of flying you will have to deal with in the real world, I can't recommend it.			"

												Have been waiting a while to buy this on steam (heard a bit back that it was supposed to be coming and I had played on an earlier version many years ago), very glad I bought it, not only is it a realistic simulator with a ton of control configuration options (it might all seem a little daunting at first, but persevere) but I am getting great pleasure out of learning to fly with Xplane...At the time of writing this review I have just done my first proper fight on Xplane 10 from Blackpool (EGNH) to Manchester (EGCC) - not a long flight (chose the route as these are local locations) but after earlier sims which basically gave you heading waypoints and large visual clues after clicking on a destination this was much more challenging. Used the VOR system to navigate to Manchester, during the flight Xplane taught me how several of the instruments worked that I glossed over playing previous flight simulators on PC.With my plane drifting a little to the left I had to correct my heading a few times (by a small amount) but eventually arrived at my destination. No clue how to use the local air traffic controllers (yet) I just picked a runway and landed...Learnt quite a bit from that hour playing the game and I can see it teaching me a lot more, I used to love flight-sims and played a lot but this game made me feel a complete novice again (especially after so long not playing any sims). However lack of arcade-game style assists, popup help and hand-holding made me feel like I really accomplished something in the game when I finally touched down. Been a while since I both enjoyed a game and felt like I achieved something. Worth the asking price? For me yes :)edit: I have added some comments to this review, including a very short version of how I used VOR to navigate, system specs and controllers being used.			"

												I have been waiting a while to purchase this sim, now that it is on Steam it left me no choice but to pull out my wallet. This has to be as realistic as it gets when it comes to flight simulation. There is a lot to learn and a great community backing this product. While you can set everything up to be off the ground in seconds it leaves the option to make everything as complex as you would like. From startup to landing you can control just about everything. I am working on my PPL, have been for quite some time. This now affords me the opportunity to learn, make mistakes, and so much more all without the associated costs. My next lessons will only be after many more hours of X-Plane, a great product!This works with muiltiple monitors, however the recommended setup is to use multiple computers over a network the acheive this. I use stereo vision across three monitors, my only hope is that they can figure out a better way to scale it when using this option, for now I distort my field of view and it works well. "

												Awesome. One of the few games I buy at full price without waiting for it to go on sale. This is a SIMULATOR. It is about as complex as what it simulates, flying an airplane. Expect there to be a learning curve. Expect it to be rather technical. Even for those of us who grew up on the MS flightsims (I started with MSFS 98), it can be a challenge. You WILL need a pretty hefty system to get the most out of this sim scenery-wise. The scenery itself can go from simplistic, just a few trees and buildings, to....realistic? heavily forested areas, congested traffic jams, city scapes, etc.			"

												This game is meant to be a full simulation of flight, and in no way is a simulation ""game"".  After this past weekend and around 10 hours playtime, probably only 5 which were spent in the sky,  I feel like I could legitimately fly a Cessna 172.  I honestly don't believe I would fly highly efficiently, but yes I could get off the ground and land.  You NEED a controller or joystick to make the game reasonable in difficulty.  There are no tutorials so learning will be a lot of trial and error(hence the 5 hours on the runway).  I used an Xbox Controller, but don't bind acceleration to a thumbstick, bind it to A and B.  If it is bound to a thumbstick it will naturally rest in 50% throttle, you can fine tune thrust in small increments with keys.I do plan on buying a HOTAS setup(ideal), but they are pricey for good ones.  The graphics are decent and can easily be modded with free content downloads(100's) on the xplane forum to suit individual tastes.  Modding is easy, took me less than an hour to put in 4.  I will most likely replace more textures/meshes later for further realism.    This game will kill your harddrive space, especially when putting in UHD or HD texture meshes(google alpilotx), its free.The tons of freeware, mods, plugins, textures you find for this game easily double the worth of it.  Please not though there are no objectives, money, progression in this simulation.  IT is purely a SIM.  Travel time will be accurate as you fly, I spent an hour or more flying over Lake Michigan from Ohare to South Haven, MI in what has to be realistic travel time(Cessna 172).Don't buy this if you want a game, if you want to learn - buy this.

X-Plane has a very advanced engine for aircraft simulation and for someone who likes realism . . . this is the air sim for you. If you like checklists prior to taking off . . . this is the game for you. If you like to jump in and go with no thought then don't waste your time with this sim.

												Pros: -> Good and accurate flight model for a desktop simulator. -> Visual capabilities are much more advanced than other desktop simulators. -> Informative for simulator hobbyists, hobbyist pilots and students.-> Navigation system (radio signals, gps simulators, autopilots) work good and feel close to the real thing.-> Keybinding system is very easy to configure and well thought.Cons: -> Sound system and stock aircraft audio effects are mediocre and sometimes annoying (repetitive sounds, cracks and pops). There are plugins that enhance the audio of x-plane but why should the user be forced to buy them? -> Stock aircraft contain unfinished and lackluster aircraft. The buyer expects all stock aircraft to be in excellent condition. -> User interface is somewhat unfriendly and there are no built-in tutorials for beginners.-> The advanced flight model which makes this simulator stand out among others, also needs a powerful system to be simulated perfectly. The flight model is tied to the framerates of rendering and when the simulation time is accelerated autopilot may function wrongly which makes accelerated intercontinental flights dangerous.			"

												(this will be edited throughout my experience)A fantastic purchased of which I am very please with, most definitely worth the 45 pounds.Whether you are into heavy sims or fun games personally I would say this is both.The options allow you to change the style of this game completely from a simulator to a game depending on how easy you want to play.Good- Excellent physics and useable functions within the cockpit of the aircrafts which feels like you are flying the real thing.- Many camera views available to best suit your play style.e.g cockpit, chase cam and others such as cinematic views- Fully customable key bindings for every action. The use of gamepads and joysticks can also be used and customized.- Thousands of mods available such as aircrafts, graphical mods, plug-ins, sounds and a whole bunch more.Neutral- Graphics are ok (Although mods are available to completely change the visuals of the game to make it look fantastic)Bad- Performance can be an issue but of course this depends on your system.- Sounds aren't the best (although like i previously said mods are available to change this)			"

												Longtime FSX user and wanted to upgrade to a more recent flightsim. Thought I would try X-Plane out. Picked it up on a steam sale and was blown away with the land and water textures. Flying at night is so awesome in X-Plane.  I noticed some things that really disappointed me.I was let down by the selection of aircraft packed in with the sim. Some are unfinished with no VC or cockpit. Also the default aircraft all have a tendency to roll to the left. I've tried calibrating my joystick, adjusting the settings in the sim. Nothing, I can't get the Cessna 172 to not roll to the left. And yes, I'm a private pilot. I know all about the left turning tendency, torque and MORE RIGHT PEDAL. I got all that from my CFI. But try and fly that sucker straight and level in X-Plane. Let go of the yoke and left turn...every time. That's an immersion breaker. Unless you turn on the auto pilot.    Adjusting the controls is a nightmare. You have to set up control schemes for each aircraft. Why? Flaps, gear, lights and views should not change depending on what airplane I happen to be flying in. The ATC.... SO BAD. Disappointed by the primitive ATC in this game. Trying to fly IFR with the ATC is impossible in this sim. Just don't even use the ATC. Your ears will thank you.   Lack of freeware aircraft. The selection of freeware is disappointing considering this is the tenth version of this game. And the payware seems to be very pricey with sales few and far between.  Your local airfield will probably not have any buildings or hangars. Why? This is 2017. This is unacceptable in a flight sim that is active and still receiving updates in 2017. This breaks immersion and makes me feel like I have an incomplete product.Im sure there are people who say, ""Just download this AddOn to fix the ATC"", or ""You can download a program to re-create your airfield"". Why? Why should I have jump through all those hoops and spend time fixing a game that was sold to me as a complete product? I really want to like this sim.

												After logging over 1000 + hours on a hot copy of XPlane I felt it was time to support the devs.Only real thing that I hate about this simulator is the cost of addons. There is lots of free addons that work great but if you really want to explore the planes at the level expect to pay from $10 to  $50 for planes and addons. If you look there is also planes hat are top notch in freeware areas, surf those xplane sites.Scenery, a majority of scenery files are free with a few pay for airports. In many cases you can avoid paying for any scenery files by finding a free version that might not be as good but works. In other case the free version can be  far better than pay versions. The Sim comes with lot of freeware from plugin to help you out better to scenery and planes which both make it more enjoyable. Payware exists but I really recommend learning the game before you buy payware  as it is expensive.Plugins, not worth paying for as there is always work arounds.The simulator can be edited in so many ways that mods, downloading, and configuring is as time consuming as learning how to land.  To give one an example of how modded the game can be, i currently have 150 Gigs of sceney files, plus five paid for aircraft alone with 20ish freeware aircraft installed totalling about 5 gigs. So if you lo ve the Sim you will need 200gigs free.  X-plane is not a game! There is missions (addons) but pathetic. There is no winning. To be honest there is no real objective.  You fly, you land, you fly more, you crash... you fly more...			"

												I´ve played 2000+ hours FS9,FSX and P3D but XP10 is by far the best in terms of physics, graphics and performance.Its not a game, its a sim and you have to spend hundreds of euros for the full experience. But if you are into planes its worth it. I dont know why there are so many negative Reviews tho, probably because its hard to learn and hard to master (for beginners). Happy Landings!			"

												This is not a game! It is considered to be simulation software. And good at that as well. It has many add-ons available (MS Flight sim x probably has more though) and the flying experience is good.Pros:I have my pilots license and the handling of the planes comes close to the real thing. At least if you have good gear attached to your pc (I just have the logitech G940). I think it' s a little bit better than MS flight sim (but comparable).It runs quite smooth on my machine although my graphics is a little older (GTX550 TI OC). I can't run it at ultra/max settings obviously because of my card.It is new and still being cared after by the developers and modding community. Can give a nice view with the right choosen add-ons (scenery/mesh especially).Cons:I looked up my local airfield(where I fly) and fair enough it exists. But, that's about it too. Radio communication is way off from what normally is and I see big jets taxiing. I'm not sure if they even manage to take off (~800m runway max).That the radio communications aren't correct is something I can understand. But jets taxiing on a local airfield is just plain wrong. Devs, please fix that! It's annoying!Price, yep it is expensive.Force feedback support. Or lack thereof actually. I did manage to get it working (but with additional add-ons).Other thoughts:Setting it up isn't too bad. You can install it and fly pretty fast. You'll want to install 3rd party mods after your first flight though. And that will take some time and bandwidth if you're downloading scenery. Yep it's a big game, but I think it's worth the trouble to actually sit for a moment and set things up the way you want them.There are probably some other things wrong with the sim. I'll probably discover those when flying some more. And maybe those will get fixed anyway. It looks good and flying is great. IF you're into flying than this might be something for you. Otherwise you might want to think twice.			"

												I'm writing this review for people who might not know what X-Plane is and may want the opinion of someone who is new to the program.X-Plane, is of course, a flight sim. It's highly detailed. People say it's the most realistic flight sim ever. Having never flown a plane in real life I cannot attest to that comment, but this program is known to be used by real life pilots for training.All the DLC in this game is included in that $60 price. You get the whole world... sort of. Not the world as we know it with the unique buildings we all know, but the land masses are very accurate and the airport locations are also very accurate. The realism, from my perspective playing many different plane sims, is a great place for any pilot to start. There are few variables to change, but they include what kind of damage you can cause the plane through overspeed or over-g. I've seen more brutal flight models in games like Il-2 Sturmovik or Rise of Flight, but I also must bare in mind that those were a different era of planes with their own set of considerations. The damage modeling in X-Plane is not extensive. This isn't a crashing simulator; it's a flight sim. Don't expect to shear your wings off with over speed or any of the extensive modeling you'd find in Rise of Flight. You'll just be greeted with a message accompanied by poorer flight capability.I do have to make a few comments about the gear I use to play the game. I have TrackIR, which makes looking around supposedly A LOT easier. A lot of people have to use the hat triggers on their flight sticks and I hear it's not very enjoyable.I have a Logitech 3D Extreme Pro or whatever it's called. It's got X, Y and Z axes and a slider bar. I can use that flight stick for full plane functionability, though the flight afficianado might want rudder pedals to go with that mix. My rig is not super powerful: Radeon HD 7770, 16 GB ram and 2.8 GHz x4. The game runs at about 30 to 40 FPS with dips into 28+ sometimes. It's not optimal for this program. I would suggest something better than what I have.It's mainly fun for me because I can make my own objectives within the simulation, though it doesn't have the premade missions that FSX had. You can also play it like a rogue-like if you want to. For example, try to make your way going North up to the very northern tip of Alaska using airports as ""save"" points as a sort of no save scumming/ironman challenge. The plus side to this is that the routes you can take are so varied that you will probably not see the same scenery twice.I say that I recommend it because you can do what I do and cruise your local airports and have a lot of fun trying to get more proficient at flying. You can pretend that the time spent in this program is actually training you to operate planes. Whether or not that is helpful to you is a matter of opinion and situation.			"

												I really do not understand the negative reviews for X-Plane 10. I can only assume they are from people who have wildly inflated expectations, fail to grasp flight-simulation as a study hobby/application, or they are die-hard FSX users and just can’t let go (“because X-Plane has flat trees”)! X-Plane’s minor issues are constantly being updated and worked on by a dedicated dev group that updates the sim every few weeks/months. The flight model is simply astounding. You feel the terrifying crosswind on final, you have to kick the rudder and stick in on takeoff. Jets will roll on their own without unrealistically having to provide power. Uneven runways that follow the grounds contours? X-Plane does this. And all of it out of the box. You want add-ons and payware content, then X-Plane is rapidly catching up with FSX/P3D. There are already add-on planes that surpass those for FSX. And the scenery? The freeware design community, especially scenery design, is actually better than FSX payware in many cases. X-Plane is a modern simulator and therefore performance is also modern. Where you might be lucky to get FPS in the high-teens at best in FSX in a complicated add-on at a detailed airport with traffic with a killer PC, you’ll get double-that, locked at a solid 30FPS and possibly more, in X-Plane. There are no freeze-frame stutters on final. No Out of Memory, No .cfg tweaking required. It just works. If you want a desktop flightsim experience with accurate modeling of the forces you have to wrestle against when flying, then X-Plane delivers with amazing results. Vanilla it is great, but embracing addons will turn it into as complex a sim as you want it to be. FSX cannot and does not compare, simply because it was released in 2006. And at that, the basic flight model stems from 2002. In fact X-Plane delivers in so many areas that I completely removed my 20 year affair with Microsoft Flight Simulator from my PC. It has a way to go in areas such as traffic and seasons, but there are workarounds available. Bottom line though is this, if you want to learn and experience flight, and then expand upon that in the same simulator, X-Plane is the only modern player. Note: DCS-World also delivers on a supremely high standard but it’s combat only in limited theaters. Enjoy! "

												I'm rather shocked to find I'm giving this simulator a negative review.  I opted to purchase X-Plane as I found FSX lacking in some categories and wanted to up the Flight Sim experience.  The graphics are fantastic and the platform runs stable, which is what drew me into trying out this sim, but sadly that's where it ends when it comes to out-performing FSX.Tutorials?  Nope, no tutorials at all.  You can buy some, watch some on you tube, but nothing that introduces someone new to flying otherwise.This simulator expects that you already know how to fly, and know how to use the instrumentation.  They're not advertising this, so they're basically selling to the masses in order to lower the price and fund the project for those who already have the skills to fly in the first place and just need a bit of practice flying someplace away from their normal zone of avialability.Customizable, well, yes, in-so-far as assigning function to keys.  Multi-monitor support?  In your dreams!  Mine had an option to utilize some instrumentation on a second screen, but kept moving from where I positioned it to where atop my active screen.  There is also several mods and add-on's to improve the graphical experience (the one feature this application excels at), but my post research into these features left me finding that the developers don't appear to bend to any of the consumers desire for improved support.  I found setup to be very difficult to figure out, plan to write down all your commands as there doesn't appear to be any kind of commend export/print feature other than a look-up while in-simulation.The simulator AI is about as dumb as they come, at least on the ground.  There was constant chatter between the Tower AI and a taxiing flight AI to ""cross runway 32, then hold short of runway 32"", this same conversation repeated several times with this exact phrase.  The plane I was following attempted to turn down every single taxi intersection, then turned back onto it's original course.  On the far end of the runway it fell off into the water and began flipping around like a fish, bouncing into the air, flipping, and turning in a single spot, before finally flipping and landing upright back onto the taxi-way, where it turned straight towards me and ran me right over without even causing a crash.Traffic and trees also have no effect on collision, feel free to land and take-off on any old street.In summation, I'm ""increadibly"" dissappointed in this simulator!   While the graphics and feel of flight perform extremely well, I find every other aspect of the simulator to be severely lacking in both realism and intuitive use/functionality.  I do hope they take the majority of negative feedback I've been reading and put some consideration to it for their next release/update.  FSX is so unstable and out of date, but leaves a very positive experience to it's user base that the fine folks at Laminar Research could truly benefit to use as a guide for putting together the next great flight simulator of all time!  I would like to think they're interested in training new pilots in addition to providing additional experience to seasoned pilots, at least that's my take on a good simulator.			"

												I've been waiting a long time for a realistic flight simulator to be released on Steam and can say I'm very happy with the experience so far. You will need to turn up the graphics to enable HDR and FSAA rendering to get rid of the jaggies. It also takes a bit of time to set up the controls but this is because they are very universal to accommodate any controller you might have plugged in. I'd like to see a few trainer missions added with a built in instructor but there are third party addons for this. The range of planes and free DLC content for all global locations are great selling points and I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to fly something more realistic than an arcade game.			"

												Unlike FSX, this game is not a huge memory hog. It plays pretty good, even on high settings. My rig is decent, but not top of a line. In this department it is a great addition to flight sims. It is very fun to fly, has decent amount of airplanes right out of the box & a great community behind it to add lots of free planes/scenery & such.The negative of this game is the airports... All of them are bare, only runways & taxiways. And for you to add an airport will costs you about 20$-30$, unless you can find a free airport created by other users. I honestly do not care if my airports have the correct building locations & even the correct buildings. I just wish all the airports I fly from looked like an airport & not like some weird abandoned parking lots... Unfortunately due to this reason, I do not recommend this game. It really kills the fun for me & I am not paying 20$ per airport, especially since I paid $80 for the game itself.Another thing is, right out of the box it does not come with training missions & just missions in general. And community does not have too many of them.			"

												I've played several years at FS2, FS3, FS95, FS2000, FS2004 and FSX. Really enjoyed the feel of flying they gave. I was anyway quite unpleased by the fact that even with a extremely powerful computer a SW more than 8 years old was not performing at a fluid framerate.Tested X-plane more for fun than convinced to find a real alternative and I was impressed!Better graphic, better accuracy in flight models. Far more better performances!!!! Nore than 30fps for a scenario that in FSX would have given at maximum 10fps!Finally a Simulator than takes benefit of the HW he has below!Great. I do not see any good reason to return to FSX.FSX uninstalled. Trying to find some good add-ons for X-plane and will enjoy for sure the new platform,Cheers,JD			"

												As a student studying commercial aviation and looking to aviation as a long-term career, I have found this simulator to be extremely valuable both to my own flight training and as a hobby. After having accumulated 3-400 hours (previous version, non-Steam), I feel confident in making this recomendation.X-Plane is a very powerful tool, with tens-of-thousands of ways to modify it to your needs. That said, a common complaint I've heard over the years is ""how do I learn to fly here?"" X-Plane kind of expects you to know what you're doing, it's not a game, it's a simulator; the average student pilot will be familiar with most aspects of flight and how to get a C-172 off the ground in the first place (full power, pull back until rotation in this case, lol).Yes it has issues -- graphics aren't the greatest, ATC is poorly implimented, AI flies in circles sometimes, you can't maintain low-Earth orbit in spacecraft, and ground physics could use work. Here's the deal though, on top of the 1,000's of 3rd party mods (mostly freeware), Laminar releases major updates every so often to eliminate these problems.I've been involved with the fan-based community for years, been involved in some major projects too. We have a very loyal community that is amazingly helpful and has the know-how to help you get what you want out of X-Plane -- whether that be serious flight training, flying in the worldwide multiplayer economic... thing, or just trying to make a PA-12 do Mach 28 in atmoshperic re-entry over China.Blue Skies,-Red			"

												After three years of pirated addons and crashes, blurries, i decided to go legit and purchase the game. Out of the box, you will be disappointed with the graphic of the aircraft. It looks like FS 2004 all over again. But then you decided to tick the controls, zoom in, out, and feel little bit better that it has built-in Ezd*k camera addon. Then you put the flaps down, taxi lights off, and  put the throttle forward. But you will be confused and disappointed at the same time as to why your aircraft rolled and skid off the runway and eventually crashed. So you load the plane again. This time, after +-40 knots you decided to not give a ♥♥♥♥ and fly the damn plastic thing. After a while, you started to feel the controls. You feel like you have control now. Then you look out the window, there it was, looking alive, roads, bridges, lights, airplanes, the sun, the water, shadows, everything looked alive. You never felt this way since the first time you got into this hobby. Ever. So you go to steam and wirte a review :+ More realistic Flight dynamics+ Awesome Freewares+ More realistic environment+ The rains actually wetting your windshield this time.+ Scenery is MUCH better than FSX/Prepar3D out of the box. Actually, i can argue that it's better than FSX/Prepar3D addons.- Unrealistic failure system- Unrealistic feel on touchdown (landings)- Aircraft graphic			"

												After spending hours enjoying this flight sim I must give it a good review and recommend it. I well start off by saying to FULLY enjoy this game you MUST install the world expansions, otherwise your world well be full of water with no map and I see a lot of reviews that are bad because they couldnt figure out they had to install that. Second all planes comes in a stunning 3D model which is viewed in the chaise View, and a 2d cockpit view (which are half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥done). Only a handfull come in fully detailed inside 3d cockpit which you can look around inside while flying with fully functional buttons/switchs/levers and gages. These Airplanes include all fighter jets, small planes, Boeing 747, Space Shuttle, and some experimental rocketplane. All airplanes are replicas down to starting their engines and the physics of the aircraft in flight, I have been playing flight sims since the 90's and this is by far the best one todate. I can start off in Calgary AB in real time weather and Time and fly to Amsterdam or KLAX or even Moscow this♥♥♥♥♥♥is legit. There are even options to set up failures with the Aircraft/Engines/Electrical and even bird strikes. There are also a♥♥♥♥♥♥tones of plug ins too for new aircraft locations and details which are free or paywear x-plane.org is the best one out there.

To most people, the sky is the limit. To those who love aviation, The Sky Is Home. That quote is one of the best quotes out there. So is this Flight Simulator this isn’t a game I’m just saying, so don’t buy it if you’re not a hard-core flight simulator guy then there is no point getting this flight sim, You NEED TO DO SOME RESEARCH Before you start flying I really Recommend watching a few videos before you start flying and read this guide made by harryorlsen (Thank you for making this) The Guide:

 < Getting started There is many good mods that you can get from Xplane.org, you do need to register  but that’s not really a problem, Please don’t refund this flight sim, it is amazing but it’s really hard to get used to it. Its more about realism than just hop in and play, if you want a fun to hop on in and fly flight sim just get FSX its really fun to teach you about basic flying, but if you’re a real pilot you will love this flight sim, there is no point even naming it a game, it’s that good, is it worth the full price YES!! It is, although I didn’t buy this flight sim, my friend Joe brought this flight sim for me and I AM GLAD THAT HE DID Thank you Joe, also I know that I don’t have many hours of flying on X-Plane but that’s is because I have switched from FSX to X-Plane 10, They keep updating this flight sim the new update is amazing it will add better sounds and a better interface to make it easy for new people to get into, just like yourself ;)I have also made a steam group for all of you aviation Lovers feel free to join http://steamcommunity.com/groups/SkyisloveAhh I forgot to mention this Flight sim is 64BIT do you know what this means? As the number of bits increases there are two important benefits.More bits means that data can be processed in larger chunks which also means more accurately.More bits means our system can point to or address a larger number of locations in physical memory.= NO CRASH (Like in FSX)			"

												To be fair I will not rate this SIM negative, but I have to warn possible newcomers.In short words: XP10 is not really an user friendly flight-sim. It comes with shallow sound, requires a lot of time for plug ins, mods or pay add-ons to achieve better visuals and use. TrackIR user will not be pleased with the out of the box support of this device. Plug-in needed.Fact is: I am not absolute satisfied with the sim-experience in this current state even after hours of modding and reading XP forums.edit: Here my steam-guide: ""For newcomers: How to become one with XP10""

												I love it and am addicted to it.Recommendation:Under setting->renderingPut number of roads to something higher.(You get more roads where they exist in the real world)Put number of objects to something higher.(You will get *generic* boxes (buildings) at those roads)Put detail distance to medium.Unclick compress textures.Put texture to high.In the beginning I found the planes cockpits to be fuzzy.Some really are fuzzy or they are meant to be used with 2d cockpits.But mostly it was because by default the texture-settings where set low and where compressedI also lacked filled road networks and buildings.I didn't see the roads I was accustomed to.The data is there for the roads. You just need to crank them up or only major highways will be shown.The cities look like gray patches by default Both the roads and object setting changes this.Quite a few of the stock planes are ugly.I would recommend the two-engine general-aviation plane Baron)Things I like to do with X-plane.Find interesting mountain-chains to fly around.The topology is from the real world and it generates a *plausable* looking world on the fly.Fly around my closest airport and see if I can find where my house would be on the road network ad by the rivers.Make flightplans, read about north-atlantic routes, learn about standard departures and standard arrivals (SIDs and STARs).Look up real world airports and their charts.I like to plan plausable and *real* flight-plans that my preferred airline uses (SAS).The world is pretty barren and the airplanes are as have been said, besides some smaller planes sub-par.I've bought two planes and two helicopters. A Boeing 777. An Airbus A350 XWB. A Bell 407 helicopter. And a RR beta 2 helicoter that seems to be used in real training for helicopter pilots.I would recommend looking to fill the mostly empty airports with building by downloading them from gateway.x-plane.com.There is a lot of scenery and free add-ons.Just search for scenery and x-plane.Applications that I use for plight-planning:* EFASS - it has real world weather-engine and a generator for weather that is plausable.It has SIDs and STARs. And online connection.As you fly your plane you can watch a sattelite-map where you would be in the real world.(Not just the blocks and generic textures and objects that are in X-plane).A great resource for free addons and forums and to buy planes is x-plane.org.Remember. It is not a game that has a goal.It gives you the tools to fly close to realistically all over the world.It gives access to GPS, VORs, DMEs, NDBs to naviate with.Even without EFASS you can use real weather and real time of day.Or choose a weather and time of day.There is a free demo to try out at x-plane.com.Pros:* Realistically calculated flight-dynamics* The whole world is covered with topological data* Low intensity* Educational* There basic software is used together with a lot of other components for real flight training for the real world* Terrain that is not cartoonie* Can look beautiful* Not just a game but a hobbyCons:* Not one really detailed plane up to modern standards. I'd love to see at least one really deeply simulated GA aircraft and one deeply simulated and visually good looking airliner.* The terrain is generated and not as in the real world unless you buy or get additional scenery* It is quite taxing on the resources at high quality simulation and visuals (Mostly CPU but also GPU)*  Uses all cores* Addicting (Just one more plane...) ;)* Not an action-game at all. Unless doing perfect landings is your view of intensity* The fighting features in it is old and arcade-like. It is mainly a civilian aircraft simulation.Conclusion:All in all it has as many hours of entertainment as you want.It focuses on realism.You will probably want at least one payware plane of good quality.Remember to up the rendering settings.Look for your airports and download them.Great community.Educational.Taxing on your hardware.A real simulator.Not really a game but a hobby.

												So far the best performing flight simulator. X-plane does a very good job of realistically simulating the physics of flight. If you are already a simulator pilot, you would already know the bitterness of OOM Errors, not anymore. I made the switch from P3D V3, and I do not regret my decision.

												First of all x-plane 10 is not a game. Secondly the modability of this sim is outrageous. Just search on google x plane 10 addons and it will lead you to hundreds of thousands of free mods, scenery, and aircraft. The graphics in the sim are very good but require an extremely strong system to crank out high res and high detail with good fps. I own all of the x plane series and I will tell you that owning this sim digitally is the bees knees. Also everyone should look into hd mesh v3; this is one of the best free real vfr scenery mods to date.			"

												X-Plane 10 is a fantastic sim. But you have to keep that in mind. It is a sim, not a game. Don't expect to be able to fly airliners on day one. It does not work like that. First you will spend some time reading forums and setting things up properly, then you will spend some more time (and money) getting addons you want, then you will spend a lot more time reading manuals and watching tutorials and after you go through all that then you're hooked! :-)If you put in the time and do your homework then it's a very rewarding experience to be able to take a fully simulated 767 (addon) from gate to gate using proper procedures, charts (addon) and ATC (addon) instructions.

												X-plane-10 IS- The best physical model of the flight- The best graphic among the simulators of flights- A big variety of different addons- AMAZING SOUNDS- Good community- A lot of hours spent on this awesome game- My favourite game!It's very cool to play X-plane 10 alone,really, but if you have a friend/friends the game becomes more interseting for 2 pilots. I advise you to find somebody to play with him or her(if you are the luckiest dude in the world)I hope that you will like and rate this game the same as me! I wish you perfect takeoffs landings,pilots. See you in the air.			"

												This is not your normal flight simulator.This is nothing like FSX.And that is a good thing.This gives you a challenge without many bells and whistles while being extremely accurate and difficult to learn but after you get the hang of it, it is very rewarding.It also has the tools bundled in so you can create anything and see if it will fly. Want to make a cat airplane and try to fly it cross country? Go nuts. It might not even get off the ground, but this is not going to stop you from trying without it looking weird.Want to have a tiny Cessna tug a massive 747 into the air via a small tow rope? Yep, totally possible (this is a easter egg though!) but be ready for a challenge to get out of that dive after you cut that tow rope.Want to dive from 35 thousand feet then pull out of it last second? You better hope your wings are strong enough because they WILL snap off (if you do not break apart on the way down).Yes it looks bare but there are plenty of free addons out there that you can install. Some are pretty, others fix things in the core game, while others are crazy user creations.The simulator is very much a platform for you to improve and make what you want and it will give you a highly accurate flight model with minimal effort on your part.Yes it might be silly to spend 60 dollars on a simulator. But if you are into flight simulators, it could be the best 60 dollars you could spend.This is not for everyone. This is for people who want a challenge.			"

												I come from FSX:SE and I was happy there. Yes, it was frustrating some times with freezings, and out of memory issues but I thought, ""well, there isn't anything else out there. PMDG planes are in FSX and Prepar3D"". Then the IXEG was released. I wanted to try so I bought X-Plane. My first steps in the game/sim were to complaint about the weird camera controls, the terrible UI, the bad scenery and airports... So I started investigating a bit in the forums about how to improve it. After all, I did the same with FSX which doesn't look very good until you add some extra stuff. So I read, and I start learning about the free awesome plugins like eBag, Terra Haze, Airport Navigator, Enhanced Runways HD... Then I found out how easy was to install those plugins (add ons) compared to how frustrating can be in FSX. I found out there are photorealist environments FREE out there. Really good ones! (yes, it's a lot of GB, but it's all free!) and from different sources, ""alpilotx"",  SpainUHD, World2XPlane...really easy to set up. And a lot of free airports also free with awesome quality! (how many times I said free?)The controls are not difficult to setup at all once you understand how the setup menu works, and the views control works flawlessly once you get use to it! (actually I wish now FSX was controlled the same way)  And the IXEG 737 is the master piece of the airplanes in X-Plane (well, now we have even PMDG DC-6) I have almost everything to high rendering quality and getting around 50-60fps. I couldn't be happier.My advice: give a try, and you won't regret. FSX is going to die anyway once Dovetail releases its new flight sim. (it's sad but is the truth) Until we can compare, X-Plane is the best option out there. Looks fantastic (try to fly over cities during the night) and flies in a very realistic way.			"

												A simulator which is continuously being improved with new free patches. While the interface may give you headache at first, especially if used to other flight simulators, it is fairly easy when you have got used to it. The simulator has great free scenery addons which arguably makes it the best looking flight simulator of the lot. X-Plane 10 now days also have a couple of really high quality payware aircrafts, PMDG’s DC-6 and IXEG’s 737-300, highly recommended for the serious tube-flyer. Combined with high performance and the unique flight dynamics makes for a very fluid experience not seen in FSX and Prepar3D. This obviously also makes X-Plane a great platform if you’re interested in general aviation flying.The upcoming 10.50 patch, which is currently in beta for non-steam users, will vastly improve the AI and ATC. The AI and ATC have previously been criticised for being dull, something which is hard to disagree with. The patch will also bring even more community made airports – no more barren airports in most places, global wind data (previously only in USA), better autogen and even better performance.			"

												I bought MS Flight Sim X and was somewhat disappointed in the graphics (understatement), so then when I saw this on sale for 50% off I jumped on it. The graphics are definitely much better as well as the realistic feel of the simulation. Trying it out, I started at a random airport in Texas and flew up to Green Bay, WI. Once I was in Wisconsin I recognized where I was without even having to look at the map! Granted I haven't spent too many hours with this yet, but I'm already definitely satisfied with this game.

												In many of the negative reviews of X-plane there seems to be a mismatch between the reviewers expectations and what X-plane is. If you're looking for aerial combat you'll be far better served by DCS World. Flight simulation whether you go FSX, P3D or X-plane is more hobby than a computer game. If you were going to get into model railways you may start with a small basic train set. If the bug bites, you soon want to add switches, scenery and new locomotives and stock. That's what x-plane is; a flight simulator starter set.You get a couple of basic aircraft, a sky and a barren planet (inhabited by only deer and birds). X-plane does itself a disservice with most of the included aircraft as they are far from representative of quality of aircraft that are available. X-plane's clouds are stonefish ugly. All the main simulators have pro's and con's. X-plane's smaller community is very committed and self reliant and there is a smorgasbord of freely available utilities and addon scenery. Some of which are pretty damn awesome considering they are free. You can get a very decent simulator experience with freeware alone. For sure, you will not minutely scratch the surface unless you're prepared to research and learn. Personally I'd recommend budgeting for an addon aircraft in addition to X-plane. I'd suggest a Carenado HD aircraft, not because there aren't other worthy aircraft, just that if you are starting into X-plane, Carenado are consistently high quality and you're less likely buy something disappointing. If you want to go a bit further, Skymaxx Pro will fix X-plane's underwhelming skies. Flight simulators may bore your socks off but they may also change your life. X-plane is a starting point for a hobby that may be with you for years.			"

												I'm running the STEAM version of X-Plane 10. My Rig is an AMD FX 600 6 Core processor 3.50 Ghz boosted to 3.80 (Corsair Liquid cooled); EVGA GT 740 4Gb Graphics card; 12Gb (3x4Bg Corsair Vengeance) RAM.Until I was given some STEAM games vouchers for Xmas I was 'flying' Microsoft FSX Gold Edition, with add-on buy=ware helicopters, as well as add-on scenery, and was pretty well happy with it. However, since buying the STEAM X-Plane 10 I very rarely fly FSX at all now. Maybe it's the novelty of having a change from FSX or it could be that I generally prefer the features and realism that X-Plane 10 gives. I'm not fully sure yet as it's still early days for me but I intend to stick with X-Plane for the forseable future at least.I don't want to knock FSX too much though as, once you are able to tweak the cfg file correctly & eventually find the right settings for your own pc rig it 'flies' pretty well, and with certain add-on scenery it can look pretty damn good too.Likiewise with X-plane 10, I'm still learning how to get the best perfomance for my own pc spec, but I do like the fact that all of the 'trial and error' spec changes can be made in-game from the more than comprehensive settings options. One problem I do have at the moment is low frame rates. I use a 32 inch HD tv as my monitor, but tend to have to drop the in game screen resolution from 1920 x 1080  down to 1280 x 720 to get decent frame rates ie (20 Fps+).  But that's something I'm prepared to put up with. for the time being at least. Overall, after downloading a purchased add-on Bell 407 helicopter, I'm spending most of my personal free time flying the Bell 407. Great fun and great realsim & would recommend.			"

												Best flight dynamics in the business. No contest. A little lacking in content out of the box compared to FSX certainly, but the sheer amount of free downloadable content for this simulator negates said issue. This is your only choice of general aviation and commercial flight sim on Steam as far as native Linux and Mac support goes. Luckily, for Linux and Mac simmers, this is a great simulator and a great alternative to the venerable FSX.With (literally) thousands of freeware downloads (aircraft, airports, terrain mesh packs, sound packs, utilities, etc.) anyone who thinks there is no content for this simulator has obviously never been to www.x-plane.orgStep 1: Purchase X-Plane 10 GlobalStep 2: Head over to www.x-plane.orgStep 3: Acquire index finger blister (and learn how to add freeware, don't worry it's not hard)Step 4: Setup sim graphics and calibrate joystick (and rudder pedals if you got 'em)Step 5: Pick aircraft and airport, load simStep 6: You may thank me at your leisureP.s.

												As many have said this is not a game it is a simulator and one aimed at private/general aviation pilots.  As a private pilot there are many things I like about this product to keep skills sharp as the price of Avgas in recent years has kept me out of the skies as much as I would like.  I've felt X-Plane has been better for that than FSX.  If you are wanting something to keep skills sharps in having to manually switch radios and such in the real world this is a great product for a pilot or student pilot.  For the more casual audience, those factors would likely annoy many and FSX is probably more up your ally.Probably the biggest complaint is the scenery and lack of real world details.  The runways are accurately modeled, but for most airports there are no buildings, etc..  City skylines are also lacking in detail.  As an example, if I fly around St. Louis in FSX the Eads Bridge, stadiums, old courthouse, new courthouse and several other iconic downtown buildings are modeled.  In X-plane it's just generic buildings.			"

												Its unfortunate that software with a very small, very dedicated, and very hard working team come up with a solid beautiful product, but ultimately shoot themselves in the foot with lofty ambitions and an inability to prioritise.It is a difficult product to review, as just with plenty of other games and various software or sim packages in the past, there is the demonstration product (which isnt what im reviewing here) and then there is the 'finished' product. Laminar have fallen into a newly created catch all (trap from a consumers perspective) of having a fantastically immersive and pretty demonstration product showing how well their ideas work, but then trip themselves up by releasing a 'commercial' product at a lofty $80 with a long list of features, the fully working parts of this sim, are fantastic, but are all of the same stock standard functions of any other flight simulator.Laminar work very very hard on getting THEIR standard features of their flight sim working, and fastidiously update them as they work futher on the product... BUT......The problem comes when you look at the list of features that are meant to be unique to X-Plane, and thats when you run into a long slew of inherently broken, unworked on, promised, or somewhat-working-low-priority-to-fix issues, that on enquiry are met with a slew of 'Well it IS just a pre-release beta version, of course there are going to be issues' What you get for your $80 - is the Demonstration area which has been spit polished up the wazoo to make sure you get a feel for what the X-Plane world is meant to be, and a handful of beautifully detailed aircraft with 3d cockpits. However, its not just a plug in the joystick and go type sim. In this regard, its supposedly meant to be a little fiddly working out how to start this and switch on that, including working nav and com (debateable - ATC was an original 'selling point' feature from day one, that has remained inherently broken since day one) systems which add to wonderful immersion.What its not meant to refer to, is having to fiddle around with background simulator options just to make an aircraft flyable in the first place (it took about an hour of googling various unrelated things to find a fix for utterly uncontrollable pitch flutter for instance) and often requires fiddling about when loading another aircraft. Thereby breaking the previously aforementioned immersion again.There is a decent sized community providing plenty of aircraft, but these are fairly badly organised, and doing a general search for specific aircraft generally brings up masses of repaints of aircraft, and you WILL download plenty, but it will take a few error indications trying to open the aircraft in the game before you figure out that most of the files youve downloaded are only repaints of a stock aircraft you dont have, and is no longer available. One particular person has worked wonderfully hard on some fantastically detailed F-14s and F/A-18s for instance, but theyre all based off an airframe made in the in game tool, with little internal detail, and the external detail it does have, doesnt really mean much when the AI flying it lands by lining up a beautiful approach, shutting down engines about 50ft above the runway, then nosediving straight into the ground. (According to most of what i can find, this is either - completely normal/user fault for not creating routes for an aircraft theyre not going to fly/non existant (always followed by a video showing one of the demonstrator aircraft on a demonstrator airfield)/it IS beta you have to expect problems/your computer is too slow/youve got a third party mod not compatible with your ai) - Occhams Razor would say - games broke.Easier to review the scenery outside of the demo areas or the hideously overpriced payware available - Its basically crap. The huge downloads for regional scenery are little more than big bump maps overlaid with ICAO points, overlaid with generic objects. Melbourne, for instance, has a 1.5km tall 'Eureka Tower' somewhere in the middle of hawthorn. (Thanks be to the crew behind VOZ  for fixing that, yet more third party freeware modders that work harder than the original developer - Melbourne actually has its bridges and biggest buildings in the right place) Ultimately, unless Laminar want to drop the price to something far far far more reasonable, and make all base software for it part of the price. and ensure anyone that actually has paid the current price for this gets all updates and payware in future either free or a drastically reduced price, this really is not software that is close to being worth the price tag.Excellent sim, but the price, the broken promised features, and the perpetual 'Beta status' excuse for anything outside of standard flight sim fare being broken combine to me absolutely regretting biting the bullet and paying for this.I would highly advise downloading it first and seeing if what you intend to use it for is broken or not then go from there, but this certainly isnt worth a casual purchase with cheap hardware.

												Compared to FSX,,,, better quality graphics, better performance with 64bit, but not as much free content out there to add on and XP10 stuff is a little on the expensive side. Still all in all I think it is a step up from FSX. I can say that even though there is better graphics , in some ways it feels more lonely so to speak than FSX. FSX oftend gives more of a feeling of activity and someone else being around with airport vehicles and the like. I think all that is some what possible with XP but not to the same extent. That said , the sale price is decent for Global since that is around 80 dollars or so retail and with this you get the global textures. If you search you can find alot of freeware and also utilities to edit and create terrain and scenery so , besides the learning curve to learn how to do all of that, I feel satisfied with the purchase.

												It is a shame I only got to know this 'game' after it was introduced to steam. I'm constantly searching for software that is using the potential of modern computers. It is amazing what x-plane is doing. It takes the map information of the whole world, searches for known objects like streets, train tracks and houses and populates this world with objects and life. Cars are driving over highways and trains run on the tracks. You forget that this is not real, when you fly over a city at night.This is not a game, but a simulator that is taking over the legacy of the MFS. I'm still flying this thing with mouse and keyboard (no way to use a helicopter this way though) until I can get a decent joystick.If you are even just a bit interested in simulations, you should download the demo. I kept playing the demo until I decided that 15 min playing is not enough for me anymore.			"

												For more than 20 years I have used Microsoft's flight simulators for training and entertainment, but with very positive reviews from fellow pilots and the flight simulator onine community I decided to give this one a try.Being a professional pilot, my review will only affect those areas of interest for using the simulator as a training platform. For example, I don't care much for how pretty the graphics are.The aerodynamic model is said to be generated in situ, like a wind-tunnel model, which makes the behaviour of the aircraft much more realistic than any other simulator I've used before.The weather engine simulates proper low visibility, icing and turbulece, however the clouds have a huge effect on computer performance (framerates) and a very decent pc is required to run this simulator.Needless to say this simulator is worthless without a good joystick. My own setup contains a yoke, rudder pedals and a throttle quadrant. The configuration of all the switches, handles and axis are somewhat harder to figure out compared the FSX, but the flexibility is much better in the end.The default aircraft that come with x-plane are of comparible quality of the FSX default aircraft, and therefore utterly useless. Where FSX has hundreds of good (often payware) addon-aircraft, X-plane only has a handfull. I purchased x-plane mostly as a future investment in anticipation of better add-on aircraft. I am very positive about the Saab 340 from x-aviation .comThe manipulation of buttons and switches in the virtual cockpits are not as intuitive as in FSX and even when bound to hardware buttons, setting radios and instruments can be quite a pain. Especially for flying modern aircraft with lot's of automation this is a bit of a pain.Overall I would recommend it, when used properly it can be a usefull training tool.Easa commercial pilot with 3000 hours on twin pistons and turboprops.

												*Sim Game- For Professionals and not average gamer*Being a pilot in real life, I used the commercial version of Xplane for my flight training. For those negative reviewers, they do not understand that this really is not a game, but a educational tool. Of course graphics and gameplay may not be up to par, because it isn't meant to be a ""game"". For casual players, get microsoft flight sim X. Xplane is only for the core aviation sim lover/training. Stop complaining if you bought this expecting an experience like Flight Sim or War Thunder, you should have done your research.			"

												I'm a recent convert to XPlane from FSX. I've been flying sims for the better part of 20 or more years.. since sublogic bruce artwick days.. I like FSX.. I like xplane.. for realism it's xplane hands down.... If xplane had the developers that that fsx has..it would dominate. 64 bit is really future for flying simming until we get to 128.. if we ever do.. We'll see how Dovetail sim does..I bought a $59.00 Jar Design 320 and it's pretty awesome.  I've flown FSX in a few months now.. I got back to it but the realism from model stand point wasn't there. Back at xplane. Not doing the 32 bit anymore..I still love FSX.. but xplane is becoming my new best friend.			"

												When it comes to flight simulators, I'm no ""novice"", not by a long shot! And in my sincere opinion, X-Plane 10, has no equal. (Period!) And this may be an understatement, as it's closest ""competitors"", don't offer the same or a similar level of performance, in terms of their physics engine/model. Nor do they offer comparable overall customization, connectivity and so on. Out of the box, stripped bare to the bones, X-Plane 10 gives the user a whole lot of bang for their buck!  (Believe what I'm telling you!) Throw in a few addon aircrafts, additional AI Traffic, scenery packages and so on, and X-Plane 10 becomes a virtual living world! It's a TRUE flight simulator that you can enjoy at your leisure, right at home. And the icing on the cake is this; you don't have to have the biggest, baddest rig to run it! And it's absolutely STABLE... How can Steam offer Microsoft's Flight Simulator X, (along with a few other flight ""simulators"") under the same roof with X-Plane 10? It boggles the mind, and defies all logic and reason to say the least. Microsoft Flight Simualtor what??? X-Plane 10 and beyond; the authoritative standard and future, of flight simulation.			"

												Brilliant flight simulator. As I am a general aviation pilot I was especially keen on the physics engine for general aviation aircraft. FSX always lacked good flight dynamics. Gladly X-Plane is very good with this aspect of flying. Doing touch and go's on a small airport with a good cross wind component (wind coming from the side) is a very enjoyable experience.The cross wind landing is a very good indicator of how good the physics engine is. Let me explain by describing the procedure.When wind is coming from, let's say right, then the airplane will be pushed to the left of the center line of the runway. To compensate this you have to steer into the wind. Doing this the nose of the aircraft will be pointing to the right of the runway. The propeller pulls you back on track so to say. However you'll be flying a bit sideways which is not ideal for a landing procedure. So to make the nose of the aircraft point to the center line again you will need to press the left pedal on your rudder pedals to push the nose to the left. This procedure can be summarized as 'Stick in the wind, opposite rudder to compensate'. So in this case your stick or yoke will be set to the right -in the wind- and your left foot will be in the forward position.Doing this in real life will set your aircraft on a fixed line towards the runway and give you a real good feel of control. Now it becomes interesting as the touchdown will change too. When approaching the runway in this configuration touching down will first occur on the side of main gear at the windy side. So in this case it will be the right main gear wheel that touches the tarmac first. Followed by the left side and then the nose wheel will gently touch the tarmac.I never got this to work in FSX. X-Plane follows this perfectly and it tells me that they've got it right. Secondly the engine is still maintained where FSX has remained as it was when it was released years back. This means that the X-Plane engine makes much better use of your video card and is easier on resources. This last part is important. It is stable. FSX crashed many times. Often when I was flying for an hour which in a flight simulator is very bad because you have to start your journey again. This hasn't happened yet in X-Plane.Then the graphics. Some reviewers say that FSX is better with graphics but this isn't necessarily the case. Agreed, the graphics look a bit dull when first installed but I found a few tutorial video's on YouTube how to make the lighting different so that shadows are more prominent and colors are much richer. That combined with a ton of free scenery which can be added makes for a very realistic experience.Last positive point is that they made it multi-platform so that I can run it native on my Linux machine. The only downside is that some add on development companies just don't want to make a Linux version of their add on. I had a conversation of a representative of X-aviation.com about their SkyMaxx add on. They just don't want to invest their time. And that is a shame as a developer needs less or no extra tooling to build an add on when building for Linux. Luckily most add on packages work just fine.One last note. It's a simulator. When you are more into arcade this will not be for you. Check YouTube to see what it's like if you are unsure.Happy flying and try the cross wind touch and go's. The are really fun!Cheers!TFK			"

												Setting the sim up for optimal performance is an absolute pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ I had to roll back my Nvidia drivers to 337.88 since this is the only driver AFAIK that works well with the OpenGL in X-Plane 10, had to do a lot of adjustments to my CPU and Northbridge frequencies, in-game graphics settings and graphics driver control panel. But it is completely worth it!			"

												As a simulator it's really good and compared to Flight Simulator, there's access to way more plane controls thru knobs and levers on the panel.The quality on graphics varies some though, while some things have been done with lots of attention, like the plane models, things like knobs and switches on the panel/dashboard are only 2D images.The flight setup makes you select your plane from a treeview menu full of folders, it works but a normal list and preview would've been better imo.You get to choose from a nice variety of aircrafts though, from small Cessna planes to the 747, helicopters and a space shuttle.Like in Flight Simulator, you can choose to sync the time with your computer and enable real-weather.The standard scenery looks ok, but I think you'll have to buy scenery packs to get something really great on that part.In terms of simulation, it seems like a good simulator, though some physics feel a bit off, like I was flying a 747-400 in chase view and tried to go extreme with the steering and it reacted like if it was made out of paper, with super quick responses that simply looked completely unnatural for a plane that size.Is the game worth its pricetag?Imo, its worth the -50% discounted price I bought it for and so I don't feel I overpayed.Regarding price, you also need to take into account that all the DLCs (aircrafts and airports) comes at a cost equal to what you normally pay for a full game.I guess the conclusion here is, that this game is for simulator fanatics who wants the best and most realistic simulation and to someone like that, it'll probably be plenty worth the full price.

												Should have made the change from FSX ages ago, but didnt like the need for a DVD or Dongle just to play. Thankfully with steam thats all sorted! Important things:This is a simulator that could be used as a game if you so chose. Buying it because you just want to play a flying game is a terrible idea - really if you want to do that, get FSX or Combat flight sim or Rise of flight, or go and play World of Warplanes. Secondly: to get the most from X-Plane, you want a 64bit operating system, as well as at least 4gb of GPU Vram (EG an AMD 290 or nVidia 970)Finally: To get the most out of this, and any sim, you need to spend some time in the community to learn how to add additional aircraft, scenery files, and other optimisation tips. Get involved and never look back!			"

												FSX is generally the go-to if you're a beginner to Flight Simulation. X-Plane has a somewhat steeper learning curve. The amount of quality addon aircraft and scenery is immense and add to the experience very well, i can't personally recommend this for beginners because it's a whole different beast in comparison to FSX and takes a bit more effort to master. If you know your stuff and you feel confident, i'd more than recommend X-Plane because it really is a great work. It has a bit more realism and functioning items than FSX does and it tends to run better system-wise. tl;dr: not for beginners, great for experienced flight simmers			"

												Addons are what make this game. £44.99 is just the base price. You need to be prepared to spend hundereds if you want to make this game like you see on YouTube. The Org Store has the best prices for addons, but they're all expencive. Planes cost anywhere between £15 - £95 depending on realism. Scenery packages range from £14 - £60.This is not a game for people who just want to have fun. You need to spend time learning aircraft systems, buying addons, troubleshooting (this game crashes a lot), and preparing FMS plans. If you are willing to learn all of this and invest, I'd say to you that you're going to have a lot of fun. You also need to have a high spec computer, the requrements listed bellow are not realistic.

I will say that the out of the box scenery isn't as nice as FSX but there are plenty of texture packs you can get that will fix that.Overall I believe that this is the best and most realistic sim out there and plenty of freeware/payware out there to satisfy you. (The 15 pack of Piper aircraft you can get for $15 is amazing) If you are looking for a more arcade style game then definitely don't get this.			"

												Had this sim for a few months now, I knew it was going to be a task master having read all the reviews on it, so after a deep breath the purchase was made  having been a flight simmer since it started up many moons ago. When writing this review I have to remember the advances in this type of sim over the years  so in reality this is a technical marvel and I feel blessed to be able to experience it for what it is, however not everything is going to be to my or your liking so i will start with the negative from my point of view, its my personal view and nothing else, because other systems will have different results. This is an advanced sim so I do not understand for the life of me why the creators have placed within it aircraft with no panels, there is nothing advanced in any of that, delete them and save us all the pain of having to even know they are there, previous aircraft and experimental planes and those planes under construction...... please please don't waste your time creators its filling gaps and you know it, I'd rather have two excellent planes for the price than aircraft I would not even touch, its lazy and takes the advanced part of the game out of the equation. 3D aircraft ... wow as default aircraft they are fantastic and a great platform to learn this sim from scratch, they are all you need for some great flying.Yes I banged my head of the wall so many times I lost count and it nearly went in the bin when everything and anything could and did go wrong, I could not get my head around the basics of setting it up, but this was solved when I  decided I did not know everything and rushing was not the answer, many good reviews on this sim and I  asked myself why was I not experiencing it, the answer was not opening the files, reading the instructions and going on all the helpful tutorials on UTUBE, yep three long nights and days studying and putting in the time and one start up later I'm enjoying flight simming experience as if it was my old FSX but more so, really ladies and gents take the time to learn, don’t rush and you will have your flight hours in no time.  Still have small problems with calibration mostly on the trims  but I’m sure I will get there. Again for an advanced sim it does not offer much in advanced terrain, airports etc, a couple of nice treats for the simmer would have been  nice, that said there is plenty on offer as add ons and if you are like me, I don’t mind the purchase if it makes a huge difference and from what I have seen they do. ATC why so difficult why so restrictive and complicated.The use of two screens, I had 3 in FSX, pop up and drag in to position and size to screen  simple. XPlane...  don’t go there  its not worth the hassle just made a mess of my screens, click on one and the other goes, or it overlays the other, drop down menus disappear and forget about flying until your back to one screen,  FSX simple, XPlane so complicated. I will get there just need to do more time on the workings of it all. That would be my main bug, why have the creators made it so complicated to set up, forget about the sim, set up has nothing to do with flying, it would be of no surprise that XPlane steam version will lose many a keen flight simmer due to this complicated set up of even the basics, needs sorting out and refining creators you owe the purchaser that much. OK I'm flying and boy am I enjoying it, start exploring the sim for what it is and for what it has to offer and you will not be disappointed with the default offerings, there is enough there for hours of enjoyment, even more if you intend to upgrade now and again, it really is a sim that will delight and with so much in the pipeline this is going to give many years  to the dedicated simmer. I really understand the frustrations of others, but I think that if you give it time and not be in to much of a rush to step inside the cockpit and take off within 1minute of downloading it, you will eventually sit back and realize the small price you paid was worth it. The sim is as good as I was hoping it to be, and from that statement I can only see it getting better in time. The developers have in my opinion let themselves down in areas, to attract new simmers they really need to take a page from FSX when it comes to the set up, take away the old and bring in some nice eye candy and simplify ATC, rendering options and such like, terminology is only of use to those who understand it. Developer should throw in  a 3d heavy and a 3d general aviation aircraft of the highest spec  and at least one area of photo real scenery with an airport, to tease is to please is to encourage. Overall simply fantastic, a great purchase a great sim ( If you manage to hold out that long)  Don’t ponder on the idea of getting it, do it and you will enjoy.			"

												If you want an extremely realistic flight simulator, X-Plane is about as real as they come. X-Plane is definitely great out of the box, but the real joy and authentic experience comes in when you start using third party aircraft. The professionally made and officially licensed planes from FlightFactor, JARDesign, and IXEG, are by far some of the best. I strongly recommend the IXEG 737 Classic (http://www.x-aviation.com/catalog/product_info.php/take-command-ixeg-737-classic-p-122) and the 757 Professional (http://store-x-plane-org.3dcartstores.com/Boeing-757-version-2-Professional-_p_542.html). Both of these airliners are top of the line for X-Plane with great detail put into the various systems, 3D cockpit designs, and models/textures. They are a bit pricey, but well worth the cost if you're looking to do some very realistic commerical aviation. If you really want the full experience, be sure to use a yoke and ideally some throttle levers and rudder pedals!			"

												An incredible experience! You can literally lean to fly virtually any aircraft in your own home, at your own desk...simple incredible. Before I took a trip to China and Tibet I flew my XPlane sim into every airport, over every sight I was looking forward to being at. The 'Google Earth' quality of graphics made it so I actually recognized the places/runways/airstirps/mountains/streams/ topography as we flew over and landed.....absolutely incredible. Combine this program with CH Yoke, peddles and such and it's just like the real thing. After some time on my XPlane sim I am able to take over the controls of a friends Cherokee 6 (1,500 feet and above) and fly it like I was born behind the wind screen.....you can too....HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AAA++++			"

												THIS IS A HARDCORE SIMULATOR! NOT A FLYING GAME!An unbiased opinion from someone who flies over 20 flight sims.Being a lover of flight sims I have all the major ones.If your looking for a game, KSP or Ace combat might be more up your alley.Ill compare this to Microsoft flight simulator for comparisionFlight ModelMicrosoft Flight simulator 10 (FSX) uses a variable chart to determin how an aircraft behaves inflight. So the control surfaces moving in game are more or less jjust eye candy. As a file controls the aircrafts variable movements. Not to bash FSX but it gives a more mechanical feel to flying. Less natural. However it is less processor intensive and easier to learnXPlane uses an advanced blade theory dynamics. Which models of airflow to calculate how the surface would behave in the air condtions. So moving a control surface actually affects the movement of the air. Giving i a far more realistic feel. Its far more difficult to fly and spin outs are to be expected.Terrain:FSX uses real world terrain data. Its a fairly low resolution so it can appear to be blocky in some places. However DSX also uses real world road maps and places large cities with real land marks. So you can easily fly around your home town and VFR flights. Xplane 10 Uses a simular real world terrain model at a higher resoultion. Making mountains much more realistic. As well as the weather effects acting upon them. However real world cities are absent. Although using satelite images the engine places cities and town in the right places. Just don't expect to be flying over the Sears tower in chicago.FSX uses the same data files to determine aircrafts ability to move in the weather. It feels very clunky and un natural. Adjust for winds and temputures at variing levelsXPlane 10 again uses blade theory. However it only accounts for ground level and altitude of your aircraft. Meaning a cross wind at the airfiled will affect a plane on land almost as much as one at altiude. However Xplane 10 uses an active model radar. So you can in theory actually fly into a hurricane in real time and watch it on radar.Aircraft Models:FSX comes with a slew of highly detailed aircraft. All with 3d cockpits and working insterments. So you can fly that little puddle jumper to an F-18 right from the get go.Xplane10 does have a lot of aircraft but many do not come default with 3d interiors. Most have some sort of 2d panel that will sufice for flying.Combat:FSX sucksXpalne 10 SucksDCS world is free. You have no excuse to not have it.Multi player.FSX has a clean and simple interface that allows you to browse and favorite servers. A modern design thats clean and user friendly.Xplane allows only direct connect. So I hope your computer skills are alright.Personal conclusion:FSX is more about the experience of flying. Weather just goofing off or flying across the world to see the sights. I often will just plot courses to sight see various places and to learn to use the systems in the game.Xplane 10 is more about learning to fly. Which lets face it. Weather you bought FSX or Xpalne is sorto f why you bought either. Xplane is just more about the feel of flying than flying. Its a great product and why I was happy both came to steam.And totop it all off most of the advatnges what one or the other sim has can be negated with addons. BOth free or payware. So it really boils down to how serious you are about flying. I often enjoy total realism in Xplane so more often than not its my go to sim. "

												I'd like to review mostly the helicopter simulation in X-Plane since I used to have a JAA CPL(H)/IR(H) (helicopter licence) and for me this is the best simulation of helicopters out there, period. The only other that comes close is DCS World, but that's a military simulator.I used X-Plane 9 to help with my instrument and procedure training and it was closer to the real thing than any other flight simulator out there and I've tried almost everything since the days of the 48Kb computers. From X-Plane 9, the 10 is an evolution with much better features and 64bit support.Remember, this is a simulator, not a game. You may find it harder to control an helicopter in X-Plane than in other ""simulations"" out there. If you prefer to experience the real handling of such aircraft, X-Plane is for you, just be prepared to crash a lot while learning, otherwise go for other easier titles. I like to think that X-Plane is much more a piloting simulator than a button pushing simulation, so smaller and more hands-on aircraft are preferable to big flying computers to really enjoy it, but that's probably just a matter of preference.Some of the aircraft included in the base X-Plane are old and poorly designed, as is most of the world scenario, but you can find a lot of freeware online. Some of the payware is also nice but it's a pity that only a fraction is in the Steam DLC, maybe some option by the publisher, Aerosoft.As a downside I believe X-Plane Steam integration leaves a lot to be desired. Laminar Research just took a lazy approach to publishing on Steam and there isn't even correct Steam Overlay integration and neither the much wanted Steam Workshop.IMHO, X-Plane is the best civilian flight simulator out there and it's still evolving.

												An incredible experience! You can literally lean to fly virtually any aircraft in your own home, at your own desk...simple incredible. Before I took a trip to China and Tibet I flew my XPlane sim into every airport, over every sight I was looking forward to being at. The 'Google Earth' quality of graphics made it so I actually recognized the places/runways/airstirps/mountains/streams/ topography as we flew over and landed.....absolutely incredible. Combine this program with CH Yoke, peddles and such and it's just like the real thing. After some time on my XPlane sim I am able to take over the controls of a friends Cherokee 6 (1,500 feet and above) and fly it like I was born behind the wind screen.....you can too....HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AAA++++			"

												This is THE simulator to get if you want to do any realistic flight training!Having a real good flight model affected by weather and spectacular visuals it is perfect for running any scenario that needs perfecting. Don't expect a walkthrough or missions, this is all about flying and it's up to each pilot to set it up for the purpose in mind.Be sure to check out all the modifications and extenstions that can be added, the obvious source for that is forums.x-plane.org. I would start with reading a forum thread on which addons to get. Carenados DLC aircraft is also really good and is a must to have over the included aircraft, which are quiet basic in comparison.All in all, this is the best simulator out there right now, and it's growing to fill the gap after FSX.

												I think its a fine Simulator, not a game. Although if you arent simulating or looking to get into flying, its difficult to learn without a full on set up. I am returning due to it seeming like i have to have a joystick or Yaw, I do not have either as I am not fully integrated into becoming a pilot. It seems like a nice nifty game, 15 bucks and its totally worth it for an aspiring pilot, unfortunately 90% of trees and buildings arent even there, you crash only into the ground.			"

												As you can probably see from my playtime, I really love this game. It is my most played game on steam and for good reason. I think I should first address the title ""game"". It really isn't a game at all, it's a simulation. A really darn complex simulation. Think of paying for the simulation engine, not for a fully featured title. The default aircraft aren't amazing, and only a few thousand (only :P) have 3D scenery. There is a wealth of free aircraft and scenery avaliable at the X-Plane.ORG forums and the X-Plane.ORG Store (X-Plane Store[store.x-plane.org] and X-Plane Forums[x-plane.org]), probably the most generous community I've ever seen for a game. But if you want a detailed simulation, be prepared to pay money, this isn't a cheap hobby. I've probably spent well over $1000AUD on addons, hardware and software, as well as all of the free utilities and things that would usually come at a premium at a P3D or FSX forum. I would personally recommend against getting X-Plane 10 from steam, and instead get X-Plane 11 from Laminar's website, as X-Plane 10 is included free with it. The addons on steam are good quality, but you can often find them on sale at the X-Plane.ORG store.The actual engine in X-Plane is fantastic. I can't really compare it to real life as I've never flown in real life, but certainly compared to FSX it's a huge improvement. You can really feel the air under your wings, as appossed to the ""flying on rails"" feel you get with FSX and P3D. The only real downside to X-Plane 10 is that it can only use a few of your cores, due to limitations with the OpenGL engine. This can lead to low framerates when you're using several high-fidelity aircarft and custom scenery. Even still, low framerates is far superior to random CTD's you get with FSX and P3D due to memory limitations.TL;DR:This is not a game. It's a simulation. Expect to have to pay big money for extreme-fidelity aircraft, but still less than P3D or FSX. It's a solid engine, runs well and consistantly. Have a high single-thread clock and a decent GPU if you want to get the best performance. The best addons are at X-Plane.ORG and not as DLC for this game, but DO NOT BUY X-Plane 10! Get X-Plane 11 from Laminar and you'll get X-Plane 10 included free! Highly recommend!			"

												X-Plane is an excellent flight simulator with a great deal of potential, and in it's current state, it is absolutely worth purchasing depending on the type of flying you're interested in.Out of the box, it is lacking seasonal textures, and upper-level weather. However, easy to install mods are available for both, including Winter_Package for seasonal textures, and XPGFS for upper-level weather. Wind transitions are fairly smooth, however cloud transitions are less so. Add-on weather engines are currently in development.Terrain graphics are excellent, and upgradeable with free mods, and paid add-ons. Airport scenery is generally complete as far as runways and taxiways, but buildings are frequently missing. This can also be rectified by downloading free scenery mods, and using the WED tool available from X-Plane's website, it is easy to build your own. X-Plane is in active development.Included aircraft vary from terrible to okay, however this is normal for flight simulators. Add-on aircraft are very good.Before buying X-Plane, FSX, or even P3D it's important to understand that all simulators are underfeatured out of the box, and add-ons, generally paid are needed to reach the sims full potential. The base simulator can generally be considered one part of the simulator 'system'.That said, with one paid add-on(a Carenado aircraft), and a few free ones, X-Plane surpasses FSX for GA flying, and with an improved weather engine and more add-on airliners will surpass FSX for airliners as well.Don't buy add-on aircraft off steam, insteady buy from a flight sim website(x-plane.org, for example), or direct from the developer(carenado.com , for example). Better support from the developer is available this way, as is a larger variety of aircraft. Most add-ons aren't available on steam, both for FSX and X-Plane. FSX in particular has a great deal of excellent add-ons, none of which are on steam. "

												This is a pretty hardcore flight sim, the physics are impressive, but one glaring problem is immediately apparent: there is no airport scenery, and barely any city scenery. Not a single airport I've seen (about 20) has any buildings. Cities are no better: New York is a few apartments and a radio mast. It is clear that Laminar Research put no effort whatsoever into the airports or into any cities. X-Plane may be better at the pure physics simulation, but even MFS 2004 is a better flying simulation. Biggest waste of $60 on Steam.			"

												For those of us in the Linux userland, there isn't much choice when it comes to Flight sims, so XPlane10 was pretty much the only choice out there. But even when pitted against others sim, the realism of XPlane really shines. I am a hardcore simmer, with 3-monitor 5760x1080 resolution on GTX 1080, 32GB of RAM and Core i7-6700k. I get about 30-90 FPS depending where I am at, it is definitely a resource hog and can use some improvements.Flight model is quite realistic and it forces you to rethink your controls (think right rudder). However, some flight forces are exegerrated and can lead to uncomfortable rights. I still get right-tendencies even in level flight. There are problems with ground shaking and abrupt FPS changes, but hopefully thoes will be fixed with XPlane11.Most importantly, I got all my hardware (All the saitek radio panel, multi-panel, rudder, yoke..etc) working without any issues. Even TrackIR works great with XPlane on Linux. It is highly recommended for any serious simmer out there.			"

SummaryA true sand-box flight-sim, X-Plane 10 offers a huge variety of options for virtual pilots. Be warned that X-Plane 11 now exists, so you may wish to check that first, if you want the latest version. But version 10 is still a solid offering.Full reviewX-Plane 10 is a first rate flight sim. It is not the latest in the series, as X-Pane 11 has now been released. However I've really enjoyed using X-Plane 10 and this sim deserves a positive review. X-Plane 10 may also still be preferred for older machines.There is a modest selection of aircraft that come with it by default, some of which have high-levels of detail. However, it is the 3rd-party add-ons which are superb and which really add to it. There are hundreds of these (and thousands of community-built ones). If you are a serious simmer, you are probably already aware of this sort of thing, but for the novice, you should consider this as buying the ""sim engine"", rather than what you'll end up flying. That said, some of the default aircraft are still pretty neat. Many implement good flight models and superb avionics. The level of detail in some of the add-ons is breath-taking. Aircraft available range from the early days of aviation, through the war birds, early commercial airlines, small general aviation, spacecraft, modern fighter-jets, gliders, seaplanes and event remote-control models.The world is pretty much everything. Apart from the polar regions (over 80 deg latitude) every other continent is rendered. Compared to combat flight sims, the availability of nearly the entire planet is really quite something. Landscapes are pretty good, but there are loads of options for downloading open-source scenery packs, ranging from photo-rendered land-tiles to high-quality airports, complete with ground traffic, etc.From a multiplayer perspective, sites like VATSIM, IVAO, PilotEdge, etc. provide a way to fly with others online, including human air-traffic controllers. There are some single-player missions available for download, but for the most part, it should be treated as a simulator, not a game or mission. Also, as a flight sim, you would be advised to use a joystick. Even a basic one would give you a great start in learning to control the aircraft. In principle you can do it with the mouse, but it really is not so good.X-Plane 10 also comes with a utility called Plane Maker. This allows you to build or modify your own aircraft. As a result, there are literally thousands of community contributions. Some are a bit rough, but some are very professional, matching the quality of the paid add-ons. Additionally, there is a well defined network interface, making it possible to link other software to the sim or to add in your own hardware and controllers.So, in conclusion, if you are interested in flight, you will find X-Plane a great simulator environment. My only caveat is that now that X-Plane 11 is available, you should check that first!			"

												X-plane 10 is a powerful engine in which one should install their payware aircraft into. The sim is well optimized and graphically pleasing.  X-Plane is easy to mod and customize. For a serious sim pilot payware is a must because the default aircraft are poor quality. To have to full experience one should be prepared to spend additional funds on payware.There ane many airports, cities, and regions which one can download for free.

												This game is overpriced. Even at paying 60$ and 5 gb, I was very underwhelmed by the amount of content provided. If you want to add any scenery, a single continent contains almost 80 gigs of scenery, which the scenery is good, but the space taken up by that is ridicilous. If you cannot afford 80 gigs for scenery, you are left with bare oceans as the scenry. You get a decent collection of planes for free. But if you want any other models, other planes worth downloading cost anywhere from 10 to 30 dollars off of various sites. Then if you want to further enhance, or make more realistic the experience, you might have to add plugins. The game is expandable in many many ways, but I find it quite absurd the amount of space actual scenery takes up, and the cost of having to download new planes into the game. Also, even at 60$, you aren't allowed to play this game in offline mode, which pisses me off, because this game lacks or has a minimal multiplayer feature. Why must I be signed in?			"

												Let me start off by saying, I have very few hours in the game, because I bought it before I had a joystick. Nevertheless, the game has a good diversity of aircraft that can be used. Like I stated, I don't have much time in this game, but from what I can remember, the cockpits were model marvelously. I feel that the movement of the aircraft is more fluid than compared to FSX. The scenery is extremely beautiful and satisfying to observe. The game includes a wide variety of features that can be turned on or off, such as bird strikes and the Aurora lights.Overall I would rate the game a 9.5/10P.S. Make sure you download the free scenery packs that are available upon purchase.			"

												Probably one of the greatest flight simulators I've found - and when comparing light-aircraft I fly in real-life to the versions modelled in the simulator, the experience and 'feel' is far closer than in FSX.Fair to say that the scenery is very empty and bland when you first install - but download the free world2xplane global scenery packs, and visit www.x-plane.org for a wwide collection of free or commercial scenery and planes - at that point everything changes. Biggest complaint would be the extreme load times even on SSD, and issues with occasional crashes. The lack of some of the cool addons like FS2Crew and a decent ATC also grind a little, but the developers are starting to come to the party. Even PMDG is due to release a new study level aircraft for it this year.			"

												One of the main selling features of X-Plane 10 is the ability to set preferential camera angles without the use of an addon or pay ware. The game looks decent, however, there is a lot left to be desired with graphics as a whole. In my humble opinion, a game should have stunning graphics without the need to download third-party graphics software. A major drawback to flight simulation games, and X-Plane 10 in particular, is the lack of tutorial or training references available. Learning to operate an airliner or even a single-engine land aircraft is considerably complex and the lack of easy to access material makes enjoyment of the game difficult. There are many of said resources on YouTube®, however, many of these resources are not consistent. A major improvement would be to include a comprehensive training program for X-Plane in the future as well as procedures manuals.			"

VATSIM is a great addition to this game, if you're inclined to try real ATC communication. My main quam is the provided aircraft with the core game are a little lacking (the default 747 is lacking key features and hasn't been updated in quite some time). But if you're interested in learning to fly, pick this one over the others.			"

												I'm a fan of simulation games. Not a lot of flight simulators are available right now in the market. The most choices are Flight Simulator X and X-Plane 10. X-Plane 10 is of course a huge jump from X-Plane 9. Graphics are improved, development progress has been really great for this game. There are some minus sides on the physics section, I hope they will get fixed. I can run this game at 30 frames per second with noticable lags in heavily populated areas. As a fan of simulation games; X-Plane 10 is a huge improvement from X-Plane 9 and I recommend it only for people who are not new to the simulation market.			"

												This is the best simulator on the market. FSX and P3D may have some pros, but X-Plane 10.4+ definitely has a lot more pros going for it. If you want an awesome simulator with good graphics this is it. Also, te X-Plane is much better for helicopters and tuboprops then the FSX or P3D. Get it!			"

												Great concept!Advantages before other simulators:- scientific and professional atmosphere of the program - highly-detailed 3D-model of the Earth with true-scaled density of objects- united 3D-model of exterior and interior of aircraft, so you can see detailed cockpit instruments from outside- global lighting system so you can see dynamic shadows from mountains to tiny objects- minimalistic, non-gaming style of interface (hope they keep this tradition in future)- open file system, tons of additional content front third-party developers- not required installation on PC of the non-steam version, ability to run the program from flash driveMy wishes:- more complicated modeling of flight and systems behavior (DCS example is perfect)- add highly detailed aircraft to base version worthy third-party content- ability to enhance Global Scenery with user objects like in Google Earth, so everyone can add his own home to the map- further improvement of global lighting (shadows from clouds, shadows in cockpit from external objects)- use 3D-model of aircraft in calculations, more 3D-modelling opportunity in Plane-maker- add non-steam version to download and activate via x-plane websiteVery enjoy X-Plane 10, now I planning to try the flight from Seattle to Moscow across Siberia at ultra- light aircraft.

												A very nice game,A lot of reviews say that you need a ''beast'' of a graphics card to run this game... in my opinion , yes you need a good gaming card but not a ''beast''.I’m using the Asus GTX 570 (yes it's a gaming card but not the latest or fastest one around now…) and it works perfect, also in good or really good quality. Also important is the need of a performant CPU to run this game nice and smoothly.The appearance and gameplay of this game is more than just ok. In the beginning it’s a little bit difficult to play this game and You should get used to it. X plane is much more realistic than FSX, because it is so realistic you need to be a good pilot to take off and fly with one of the bigger planes like the Airbuses or one of the big Boeings. For example; before taking off you must complete all pre-checks and start-up procedures just like in the real world.Even the weather decides in which circumstances you’re flying.If you fly in bad weather you need to be well enough trained to accomplish the  requested route. if you want full simulator experience with all DLC packages and if you want to play it In ultra-realistic mode, you need to spent some more money on it.Also take note of the fact that you need a proper joystick to play the game smoothly because it’s hardly playable with only a keyboard.

												Great sim. Runs really well, looks great, actively developed. Flight modelling is awesome w/GA types. Several neat integration options (EFIS apps, etc. developed by third parties for Android & iOS) The major criticism I have is that airports can be a little sparse as far as buildings go. That's easily remedied by grabbing free content from x-plane.org or payware airports if you're into that. Additionally, landclass data used in X-plane seems like it might be a little old, which causes some areas of cities to be sparser than they are in real life.I recommend checking out the ""X-Plane 10 HD Mesh Scenery"" available  from alpilotx. It uses higher resolution texturing and newer landclass data, which helps some areas look closer to how they look today.Additionally, acquiring this via steam is significantly more convenient than having to either buy a dongle from laminar, or leave an optical disc in my PC. The only downside to that is that it's a little tougher to get in on betas if you wanted to test those.			"

												This is the best sim out there in my opinion. Go to xplane.org and download more FREE planes and Scenery: http://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?app=downloadsGet the flight school, and the voice command pack (a must), also don't be afraid to invest in some advanced planes and gear. I've found the Saitek X55 to be a great setup for flying. You can get Flight school and other things at: http://store01.prostores.com/servlet/x-planestore/Detail?no=409If you're having scenery issues, take a look at my post on xplane.org: http://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?showtopic=78822If you're looking to putz around, Arma III is your game. You can putz around in Xplane, but you'll get bored quick if that's all your looking for. Yes, you can download and arm fighters i Xplane as we often ""shoot each other down"" when we're in wild moods. Which kind of ticks you off when you're on your final approach and on your ILS and Glide slope ....and boom, buddy takes you out. You can network with other friends with this game. This game runs fine, but it's not going to run on a 486dx...you'll need a decent system to run it, and you will need to invest some time into ""learing""...""imagine all that"". I'm sorry for the people who are not happy for it, my best advice....go play Arma. This is probably a little past your level of ""gaming"" as it is more than just a game.This game is HIGHLY recommended for anyone interested in aviation and not just screwing around. I still get yelled at about my taxi speed and missing my glide slope. There are so many free plugins and scenery enhancements for this game it will make your head spin. You want great scenery?

												Wow, so far this is not a good experience....I've had my Private Pilot's license since 1994...I've owned Microsoft's Flight Simulator X for many years, I then bought X-Plane 9, and was not impressed at all....The marketing for X-Plane 10 was really good, but unfortunately this seems like a repete of my experience with X-Plane 9....I'm starting to wonder if the people who gave raving reviews have never experienced MS Flight sim X..Given, I've only played with the sim for about two hours, I feel like it's two hours I'll never get back.....MS flight sim is such a more well rounded inclusive experience...I'm mad I wasted $29 on this....As a Simulation it is good, but MS flight sim X was just as good as a simulation, but there was soooooooooooo much more that MS flight sim X offered......I think this is Junk compared to the Microsoft alternative.

												As a flight sim this is one of the best. Flight dynamics are incredible. Scenery great. There are some negatives that future buyers should be aware of; I bought this for Linux. My rig is an AMD Phenom II with a Radeon R7 250. The game will not run for more than 50 minutes. Average game time is 15 minutes. When booting into Windows on the same machine the game works great! Which is sad because I would rather game in Linux.Second, outside of the Seattle area, airports have no buildings. All runways seem precise but not a building on the airport. Plenty in towns neaby. This is only a minor thing. For what it's worth I have only used North American maps so they (the buildings) may exist in other parts of the world.Recommended? Emphatic YES on Windows. Big fat NO on Linux.			"

Pls. check out the Images posted on Artwork / Community Hub.  its a Half A%ss game. but Hey DO YOU LIKE BUYING PLANES WITH REAL MONEY,  they have a website for you to spend $15 - $45 bucks for a PLANE.  beware!

												A disapointmen.  Flight dynamics are good but not much if any better than the other two.  Worst is the lack of any realism in most airports and the total lack of detail outside the Demo area.  Look for example at LuangPrabung in Laos.  In FSX a few buildings and a small town, with FSX global a complex town with a working semirealistic airport. In Xplane not one house just an airstrip.Similarly with most other towns.I would almost say it is deceptive to have a demo region signifigently better thna the rest.Not recomended.			"

												Overall, I only have 80 hours on X-Plane 10, so I, by far, am not an expert. My catalyst for buying X-Plane 10 was to see how it compared to FSX (which I also own through Steam) because an instructor at a local flight school mentioned that his lower level simulators for the students used X-Plane 10. That got me interested... what first caught me off guard when using X-Plane 10 the first time was the sloping runways (runways can be selected to follow the contours of the ground) so, no more flat runways like seen in FSX... not to say this is better or worse, it's just a fact. I was also pleased to find my Navigraph subscription could be used to update some nav data for the gps within X-Plane 10! I would say if you're on the fence, give it a try!			"

												Far more advanced than any other flight simulator out there. You definitely need 3rd party addon aircraft to really enjoy it. The standard aircraft are a bit of a joke and there are some silly gimmicks in it such as deer that run out over the runway. Graphically it is beautiful if you have a powerful PC and most of the flight dymanics are superb. Needs the developer to attract more high quality addons to it and it could be a real success.			"

												I thought I'd try out X-Plane 10 in the hopes that it would be able to replace the aging FSX. Whilst FSX is great and is the gold standard, it's old architecture places limits on it which we have pretty much reached now. X-Plane 10 is the ONLY 64bit high fidelity general  flight sim and that is able to fully use today's hardware. Add to that the fact that its flight model is more accurate out of the box than FSX and you have a recipe for success. Right? The flight model is good. The planes don't feel like they fly on rails (unlike stock FSX). The auto-gen scenery and effects are very good. The environment is gorgeous straight out of the box. It runs smooth as silk on my machine. But... I only put a few hours in the sim before regretting downloading it's 50 odd gig of content and returning to FSX. Why?Part of the joy of sims for me is immersion and level of fidelity to reality. Whilst X-Plane 10 hit the ball out of the park with flight modeling, its ""plausible world"" just simply isn't. I was dismayed to discover there are very few runways or airports with any buildings on them. Almost all of them are just flat strips on the ground with no buildings, no life, and no feeling of having actually arrived at a destination. Every landing feels like a landing on some remote bush strip in the middle of nowhere. In addition, the various cities and locations don't actually look much like those locations.  You have to go to great lengths with addons to rectify this sitation, and even then it falls short of the mark.The cockpits of the default aircraft look like they were made a decade ago (I think some were!) and a number of the 3d virtual cockpits just dont work at all. I was so disappointed that I felt the need to drop some money on a plane from Carenado on day one, just to enjoy the experience. This was a major disappointment.Another area that X-Plane get's let down on is developer support. Compared to FSX or Prepar3D, there is very little in the way of professional addons, scenery packs, and aircraft. X-Plane does have a thriving amateur community creating content... but that is exactly like it sounds.Oh, the UI is clunky as hell and the loading times are a nightmare!All that being said, I do enjoy the feeling of flight in X-Plane 10 and it does run very well. If you only care about flight modeling and the feeling of flight, and can live with scenery that doesn't reflect the real world then this is a great sim and I recommend it. If you are new to sims, it's Steam access makes it a great and easy place to start. It's for these reasons that I am going to give X-Plane 10 a thumbs up.			"

												This Flight Simulator is just overpriced and unfinished.Scenery: The game includes all continents with procedurally generated scenery and the possibility to go to orbit, objects look good but they are very often misplaced. No seasonal textures and the weather system is really basic, no weather conditions beyond wind, rain and storms, no snow.The game doesn't feature any city and homes/objects are spread around randomly without a sense, but yes ! you have animals running around the airport LOL, Really nice but doesn't make any sense...Physics: Physics are realistic to a good extent , this Flight Simulator uses Blade element theory in flight models instead of premade tables with all parameters like in most other flight simulators, meaning the actual shape of the plane is used to determine its flight parameters.game includes editors you can create your own planes with, you can then load them into the simulator, this game is good as an engineering tool, you can build your own planes and test themGraphics:Graphics are nice and textures are at a good resolution but nothing special in my opinionSimulated Air Traffic, ATC:Seriously lacking, AI implementation in the game is really bad and probably just a work in progressOther features No flight planner !!!Controls are a mess and flying with keyboard+mouse only is tricky, not cause of the simulation but because of the bad implementation of controls.Gauges are all there fortunatelyConclusion:I really don't feel like recommended this Flight Simulator unless it's for sale at 20Euros or less,  lack of almost everything, when I fly with this simulator I don't feel I'm a pilot in a living world, the fact it has bad ATC and AI traffic makes it a bad flight simulator for more than aircraft design  and aerodynamics testing,  non-intuitive controls, very big installation with barely any content worth seeing , I really wonder why those files are so big since they have absolutely no orginal content other than terrain,  no real world cities, the whole scenery is procedually generated so don't expect to get so much out of it as it is, there are however a lot of websites with sceneries based on the real world. However  I don't suggest buying it unless it becomes cheap enough to worth it.If you want a very good and complete flight simulator you can buy Microsoft Flight Simulator X - Steam Edition, it has very good planes, the whole planet to explore including all major cities with their own landmarks, a huge decades old community making additional content for the series.Alternatively if you want to focus on Military aircrafts try DCS World, it's free and it includes 2 planes , more planes and helis are sold as DLC			"

												I can't really recommend this program. (it is not a 'game').   As of 3/3/15, X-plane 10 offers a seemingly decent form of aircraft, flight, and limited airport simulation. This comes at the expense of a UI, a functioning Main Menu, any form of missions or objectives, any form of training or practice. X-plane 10 is quite literally *just* a simulation of flight, at the expense of any grace or sense of direction outside of what the user puts into it and what flights or flight situations the user creates themselves.That is not to say that, for experienced pilots this program wouldn't have it's uses, in fact I think that is it's intended audience, experienced pilots who have the basics down quite well already. This is not an introductory course. Now, this much is my fault and I admit it openly, I purchased this in err, without looking this up. I was looking for an introduction to flight, this was literally my first ever flight sim purchased, I saw how it looked visually, read some favorable reviews, and figured that X-plane 10 is a top notch product. At the high price of $60.00 USD, I expected things like a functional User Interface, a main menu, some wise setup that would let you set some important factors like controls and video settings, sound settings, etc. before entering the game. I started up X-plane 10 to immediately be placed in an aircraft on an airfield, with resolution and performance issues. I went about figuring out the controls, setting the video settings, etcetera. I found out this program is nothing if not the raw material with which you, the user, can use to create your own scenarios and flights. I still have annoying issues with camera movement, (I use a controller and have used a joystick setup as well), wherein clicking in some areas will blip out to the desktop for a second, cameras resetting to odd positions into weird directions for no reason, and generally some performance issues (low frame-rate, even with a 64-bit version of Windows 8).There is zero incentive to purchase this product if you are a beginner, if you're looking for an introductory, learning experience into the flight scenario, if you expect missions, tutorials, a proper main menu, flights, a convenient set-up then you'll have to look elsewhere. If you know how to fly so-and-so plane, and could probably perform a successful flight and landing with no hand-holding whatsoever if you were placed into a fueled version of said plane in an airport, I imagine this would be a very entertaining program for you, and maybe even a good source of practice. If setting up your own flights is your thing too, I'd think you can enjoy this. For this price I simply can't recommend X-plane, in it's very rough and wanting current form. Instead, I will recommend Microsoft Flight Simulator X Steam edition. Though an older title, I pull a much superior performance on it, it has a proper UI, it is far easier to work with, has an actual main menu, and also will give missions and challenges, tutorials and training for beginners as well as a place for experienced pilots to work with.For a program that comes off as rough as this, I just don't feel the price is justified.

												It's a great game if you like comercial aviation simulators, graphics are good quality and flight dynamics are as good as they get. However it does not come with great planes, the ATC is awful and buggy and it lacks a world of stability, at least the Mac version. Around 30% of the times I fly it crashes, I cannot change plane once I'm in the game because it always crashes right after I do it, etc. Overall you spend 100s of euros in the game plus decent planes and scenery and it sucks that it doesn't even manage to function properly.

												While this game can be pretty system requirement heavy and the graphics may not be the best, it is an amazing flight sim for realism. The game's physics and navigation tools are amazingly detailed and accurate. The airfoil designer lets people have amazing aircraft for others to enjoy or allows people to modify the cockpit of existing stuff for instrument layouts to better reflect another style.  The game also emphasizes using proper air traffic control procedures, which I have yet to scratch the surface on.My only real beef with the game is the time compression being rather difficult to do at higher  multipliers, as the requirements are pretty high. I also find it missing some airports around the world, like in China, but I could easily add them myself with the creator tool.			"

												I totally dissagree with other reviews. This is one of the worst simulators I have purchased. I have purchased every FS since 1983 and to compare what you get for your money out of the box to FSX is ridiculous. FSX gives you graphics and missions and different airplanes all for the original price. This gives you almost nothing. The free scenery downloads from Steam are terrible. There is not even the statue of Liberty in New York. I have just downloaded over 30 Gig of scenery and it is so unrealistic I can't even compare to FSX. I will be asking for my money back from Steam! Never been so dissapointed in a game that I was so looking forward to getting.I would also like to add that compared to FSX, the cockpits seem to be non functional as a lot of the controls on the display do not do anything especially in the 747. I am not sure where or how this is considered the best Simulator unless there is a lot of geeky work I have to do to make it seem more real. After painstakingly setting up my complete flight yoke and pedals to operate all controls I actually find it is nowhere near a real. It seems very oversensitive with some controls and absolutely dead with others. With FSX it is really noticeable of the difference between flying and Airbus and a Boeing. Of coarse with Xplane you can't compare because you have such a limited choice and again the cockpits are archaic compared to FSX. The controls to pan around the cockpit are bad, when zoomed out all the way, you cannot see your controls and the windshield at the same time. I have this set up on  a 120"" screen and I have a massive windshield in my view or a massive set of controls. you have to pan up and down continually. I am really confused as to why this gets either very good reviews or terrible reviews. There must be something we are missing! If anyone knows what we, who are not recommending this program, are missing, I would really appreciate some feedback as this is one of the worst simulators/flight programs I have every used because of the lack of user friendly interface or GUI. Old fashioned menu's with way to many settings and selections. Kind of reminds me of the old DOS days where absolutely everything had to be inputted.			"

												A lot of people consider X-Plane to be the direct competitor to the Microsoft Flight Simulator franchise, and up untill recently, it was one of the only frequently updated flight-simulations in the market, let alone the only 64-bit simulator accesible to the public.However, now with the release of the optimized version of FSX on steam, does Austin Meyer's 'X-Plane 10 Global' hold up?That question was answered in the rating you saw I had given this sim.For about $47 less then the price of this product, FSX simply provides more out of the box. A plethora of missions, seasons, a nice roster of default aircraft and tutorials - this simulator has none of that. You are more or less purchasing the engine this game was built on.Its a nice engine, mind you, since the blade-element based aerodynamics do provide a more fluid flying experience to say, FSX or Aerofly. But this does nothing to negate the inconsistent quality of the default aircraft, the godawful air traffic control, the supposedly advanced scenery generator, which doesnt end up looking all that good anyway and the depressingly ugly AI, to name a few issues this simulator has.At the moment, I would only reccomend this sim to experienced simmers who understand what they are getting into with this product. With some additional add-on content, you can actually make this simulator into something special, but  this simulator, as is, is a $60 money sink that is probably not worth your time as of now.Buy FSX instead, a sim that was made almost 10 years prior.

												It is actually really gratifying to take off, set the autopilot, and land on the (somewhat) realistic depiction of the land next to your house.  Realistic modelling of the effects of airspeed, cargo weight and location, fuel levels, and machine failure all come together to make this an airplane tinkerer's dream.  Definitely reccomended for kids who can't absorb enough information about aircraft up; you especially will be sure to impress any pilot with your knowledge of plane instrumentation.			"

												Is this FSX or P3D? No. Is it better? No. How can you compare the two/three? First FSX is old but good and has a lot of add-ons for it. Same goes for P3D. X-Plane 10 has 64bit and better use of system hardware. Out of the box with the included scenery on most systems it will look better than FSX/P3D. Aircraft behave and react more realistically in X-Plane. Most airports have no scenery so it’s a barren world but it is easy to find DLC for most big airports around the world. You can make your own with the tool provided if you have the time and energy to do so. It’s a little harder to get started with X-plane but once you get the hang of it your good to go. It can do more than the others and has an easy API system to interface with if you know what you are doing. It’s more of a programmer’s sim as in if you can program there not much you can’t do with it.			"

												Kind-of disappointed in the latest Windows copy from Aerosoft as it will not start no matter what I try. No logs... anywhere... containing any info related to the error. Also verified the Game File Cache Integrity which doesn't help, Redownloaded the 16 (19?) GB twice on a slow connection. Not helping. Yeah, frustrating :) Checked file and directory permissions and ownership. Checked administrative priveleges. Not running in Compaibility mode. Yes, Steam is running. No, not in off-line mode. Yes, connected and logged in. Yes, Internet connectivity. Yes, restarted system. Gazillions of times.Windows 8.1 Pro 64 bit. 16GB RAM. NVIDIA GTX-750M 2GB GDDR5.Anyway, the game won't start becuase of an Error ""SteamAPI_Init() failed. Steam must be running to play this game"". There is no way for me to go back to the 10.25 final version without buying the DVD set also. Must I really spend more money to fix a stupid issue? Come on.Besides that, using the Steam Client DLC view also, always  takes me to the app's web page that says i can activate the optional DLC content using the steam client. Really? Where? With the knowledge that X-Plane (company) is not to blame, (just wondering if it was the right decision to give Aerosoft the resposibiity to build the steam version, I give both them and Aerosoft cudo's for their quick responses to my support requests. Think I'll get any support from the Steam developers? Sorry... no... they're too busy for them to answer e-mails, or too busy with other things for them to develop their support web site properly so I can add multiple attachments without losing the info on all the other fields.Last but not least, if you've got the DVD set, or thinking about getting it, this game is for you. If you've got the Steam Windows version, good luck. This is a really good game from what can be gleaned from all the videos and other resources out there. I highly recommend it to avid flight-simmers and even real pilots.			"

Not only can I confirm this myself, I can get an even better opinion. My flight instructor was the person who finally convinced me to switch to X-Plane. I haven't touched FSX in months, and I have over 1000 hours in X-Plane. Also, X-Plane comes with some great tools. I use said tools to develop medium-to-high quality aircraft. If you had any doubts about buying X-Plane, throw them away. X-Plane is the most accurate simulator of them all.			"

												After a disappointing purchase of X-Plane 9 on CD some while back (media wouldn't work) - I'm happy to say the X-Plane 10 is enough to make me overlook my past experience.This title offers more enjoyment than FSX or MS Flight and runs well on 3 monitors on high settings with a 4Gb 760GTX (though could always be smoother).  Also using Thrustmaster Warthog (configuration for this title is the simplest of any title I've found).Watching night traffic and spotting a police car zooming down the road is one small but nice touch.Sadly no Oculus support enabled atm.. but who needs the motion sickness anyway?In my opinion worth $29.99.

												A great flight simulator. You can do a lot of cool stuff like fly the space-shuttle, make your own airplanes (with a lot of time and effort put into it). And even go into space.My favorite part though is that the airplanes in this game feel real. I've flown in a lot of small aircraft and they have this feel to them that X-Plane 10 simulates very well. FSX just doesn't feel quite right with certain planes, they feel too stiff, or too light. Also the realism is absolutely top notch. I've played multiplayer which is pretty fun too, and practiced flying in formation, I was suprised that in this game there actually is backwash from jet engines. So you can't fly in someone elses backwash or you will pay the price.This game also has some weapons put into it, they are difficult to use though, and although they explode they don't really do damage to scenery or anything. They do damage planes but the damage is largely functional not visual.I have never been thrilled with the helicopters in this game however. I've never been in a helicopter before but they are a real challenge to fly in this game. Whether that's good or bad I'm not quite sure.			"

												This flight sim when I first got was fairly impressive but it lacks clear menu's as it is not easy to find your way around. Like many flight simulators you have to invest in aircraft and other addons for the full experience especially airliners. The defualt Boeing 747 has really poor cockpit quality and takes away from the experience, so I got a JarDesign A330 and A320 which is costly. However it is well worth it. The ATC is fairly buggy and I never use it but there are great plugins like x-life. The scenery and night lightening is generally outstanding and again can be made better with mods. I have played on a laptop and it was good but FPS was an issue. You need quite a powerful PC.Overall its a great sim especially if you have a few bob to spend don't be expecting hundreds of planes as generally nearly every flight sim is costly iff you want a great experience. It is definalty my favourite flight sim.			"

												First, this is not a game it is a simulator.  Compared to FSX it has better flight dynamics.  I have over 10,000 hours in several multi-engine jet aircraft and it has the feel and reaction of the real thing.  FSX feels like driving a bus  compared to x-plane.  ATC is better in FSX and is okay for a simulator.  X-plane ATC is so bad I never use it.  I plan my routes to include descent and setting myself up for an approach without ATC because it is just unusable and doesn't even come close to the real thing.   Scenery in x-plane is better for atmospheric conditions and the out of the box terrain is comparable to FSX out of the box.  FSX does have better add-on scenery available.  X-plane surpasses FSX on the actual runway.   X-plane runways follow the terrain and are very realistic.  FSX has better stock aircraft than x-plane so plan on adding a payware aircraft unless general aviation is your thing.   If checklist are your thing, FSX add-on aircraft like PMDG 737NGX are probably better than many x-plane add-on aircraft from a switchology standpoint.  I have the PMDG 737NGX for FSX and the FJS 737-200 for x-plane.  Systems functionality is more realistic with the high end FSX add-ons, but x-plane add-ons are comparable and generally cheaper.  Cockpit graphics are better in FSX, but x-plane is catching up.  Weather conditions more accurately affect the aircraft in x-plane.  Try a 30 knot crosswing landing in FSX and x-plane and there is a noticable difference with x-plane being very realistic.It all depends on the desires of each simer.  If you are really into checklist procedures and in depth systems operations then get FSX and pay for a high end add-on like a PMDG aircraft.  If flight dynamics and a very realistic feel to the aircraft  that is close to the real deal then get x-plane.  I prefer x-plane and if it had a decent ATC I would probably uninstall FSX and exclusively go with x-plane.  I split time between the 2 right now.  Hope this helps anyone trying to make a decision.

												I bought this because although I'm excited to see that Flight Sim X has been resurrected on Steam by Dovetail Games, it's still 8 years old, and I wanted to see how X-Plane has developed over the past 8 years.  I'm sure this is a good product, it sure looks very nice, but I wanted to flag a few things that new buyers should be aware of:1) X-Plane is the only 3D product I have ever used which isn't capable of changing the display resolution.  I'm running it on Windows 7 installed on a Retina MacBook Pro, which has a screen resolution of 2560x1600.  This is great for desktop work but awful for games, as that high a resolution on a mobile GPU means terrible performance.  This isn't an issue with any other game because you can set the resolution to 1280x720 to boost the performance and it still looks good on the 13"" screen.  However, if you set X-Plane to 1280x720, it draws that resolution in a tiny box in the middle of the 2560x1600 screen, which is basically useless.  If you want to run X-Plane at a lower resolution than your monitor, you need to change the Windows desktop resolution before loading X-Plane, which is a pain.2) Upon launching the game, I was parked on the end of a runway, ready to have a quick test flight to check out the graphics and performance.  However, it looks like there's no keyboard or mouse mapping for the flight stick - I was able to increase the throttles, adjust flaps, and get airborne, but there was no mapping for the aircraft flight controls!  Looking through the settings, I couldn't even see a mapping that I could change for these.  It turns out you can (technically) fly using the mouse - you have to click in the windshield of the 2D cockpit and you can then use the mouse to control the flight controls, but it's pretty nasty.  Also, this doesn't seem to work in 3D cockpit mode, which is my preferred view.3) To download the scenery, right-click on X-Plane in your Steam Library, and go to View Downloadable Content.  You can then click to download the other areas.  I was going to the X-Plane page in the Library, clicking on DLC on the right, which takes you to the DLC page on the Steam Store, where it was showing all the scenery packs as already in my library and ready to play, which was confusing (this is an issue with Steam's terrible user interface rather than X-Plane).I still recommend X-Plane, but you should be aware of the above issues if you're in a situation like myself.

												The main game control interface (I don't mean aircraft's painels) still have to improve a lot, it's a mess.The game is not complete, since the default airports are not modeled in 3D (so they started selling them $$$ without quality pattern). If you buy multiple scenarios the game will crash.Gamepad control: configure and adjust it's a headache.There is no user support for the Steam portal, just ads and sales.The list of standard aircraft is small and with a inferior quality.I downloaded OpenSceneryX library. However, there are no support or revisions.It's not a simulator, it's a game more stressful than fun. You can turn ANY airplane upside-down at full speed without any damage. The runways are smooth. The physics simulation in general is inferior to FSX that was released in 2006. The orbx scenarios are much higher.So them are pushing $$$ you to the X-plane 11 game (i tested it...) that is only a graphic slightly better than the previous one, however the most current games have a higher graphic quality (Project CARS, Arma III, Fallout 4, Grand Theft Auto V, etc...). There is no grass, realistic raindrops, trees movements or ground services by default.The physical simulation has not been improved, the aircraft are the same as the previous version without any improvements.

												Not very userfriendly, mostly good looking. Might be a good sim but I wouldn't reccommend this at all.Unless you really care about good looks I'd much sooner recommend FSX, even though that's a rather old game itself.This game is mostly interesting when you are into stuff like p3d. But if you are into that you're probably better of with the x-plane pro (or something) version, which is even more expensive.DLC's are available in ridiculous numbers, as is other supporting software, but that is only interesting if you are *really* serious about simming I guess, because it gets expensive really quickly, and this game doesn't offer much from itself except  some planes and alot of ground and air, but no real interface, no flight planning, no tutorials or other tool to guide or teach.That's what I call an imcomplete product, and personally I think that this sim is hardly worth half of what it costs today (about 60 euro's).

												I read all these reviews about it being very lifelike and accurate but I have yet to fly anything in this game where that's the case. I mostly enjoy the fighter jets and I can tell you the physics are just absolutely terrible. The plane will be flying sometimes almost sideways. It's just terrible. Coming from FSX, I can say that there's no way I can recommend this game over that. FSX might not be quite as detailed when it comes to like the trees and stuff but I'm in it for the flying of the plane, not the looks of the land around it.			"

												If you're both a Mac user and a flight simulator player like me then I'm sorry, you're screwed; X-plane is the only major platform flight sim for us, at least that I'm aware of. When I decided to uninstall Boot Camp et al for more drive space, I thought X-plane would be on par with MS Flight Simulator X. After all, most people in the sim community talk about the two games concurrently. And X-plane is very proud of how their aerodynamic models are better than those of FSX. Now, after +240 hours on X-plane, I can say that those aerodynamic models seem to have come at the cost of every other aspect of the game. Here's the good: most of the time, you can sync real world weather into the game. Also there is a good size community of free- and pay-ware DLC too. Finally, the flight models are great. A note on that last point, from where I'm sitting they are no better than FSX for the vast majority of flying.Here's the bad: the ATC is worse than useless. The game crashes often. The real weather updates every hour and every new map and the changes are immediate. The UI is a pain. And lastly there are errors in the weather radios.The ATC is breathtakingly bad. Here's the bottom line up front; you either file an IFR clearance or you don't use your radios at all. There is no in between. If you aren't on an IFR plan, there are no ground controllers, no towers, no traffic, nothing at all. It’s a radio wasteland for anything but weather. When you do want to file an IFR, the overwhelming majority of the time, I cannot get it to respond at all. I've looked up online help and searched the forums, but from where I like to fly out of (KUAO) they just do not respond. It’s a complete failure, and nothing ruins the immersion more than taking off at KLAX without talking to a single controller. The weather sync is interesting and fun, but it makes the game more unstable. It also makes flying more interesting than it needs to be. When I said, “the changes are immediate,” I meant one second the wind is 030@13 and the next moment, it’s at 240@30. It makes things very interesting indeed. I've had it go from sunny to stormy in as long as it took to read this sentence. And the manual weather UI is, along with a lot of other points in the UI, useless. Random weather? Okay but it'll be 20 degrees C most of the time. Want to see where your plane is on the world map? Okay but click anywhere on the globe and poof, your transported there, oh and at the same altitude. My An-24 (a really well done payware machine I really recommend) responds badly to being transported into the inside of a mountain. Finally, I know at least some of the AWOS channels are wrong, for example KAST gives you the weather for Olympia, WA, which is not near to the airport.In summary, the X-plane people seemed to have focused on only one part of making a flight simulator: the flight. And it's great, it really is, however, it comes at the expense of everything else in the game. It’s hard to enjoy the flight dynamics when you're on final at KSFO with silent radios and a cross wind that just changed 180 degrees in less than a second. I think comparing X-plane to FSX is like comparing a super car and a sports car for a daily driver, let's say the Porsche 911 GT2 RS to a Porsche 911 Carrera. Both are great cars; fast, fun, and exciting. The first can do +200mph. But the second has air conditioning and a radio. Which do you think you'll use more?			"

Also, i still prefer FSX because XP10 ATC is an horror movie.PROSGood graphics, it's much better in 75% of the aspects than FSXWide range of fly configurations ( failures, scenarios, probabilities etc... )It has Almost every airfield or helipad in the world More instrumental cored ( So is very good if you like to fly tunned to your cockpit )WAYYY Better physics than FSXBetter engine for sound adaptation than FSXGood game engineGreat freeware easy to make editors for airfields and mapsGreat flyplay immersionThe camera effects and 3D makes the game looks more realistic at some points ( ex landings )CONSMost airfields are just runways and taxiways.Terrain on SA, Africa, Asian and Oceania are low-resolution lamesThe seasons doesn'tt change the map texturesVanila ATC is a joke ( very very joke )No crash or colition zones between airplanesConfiguring the controls require more time than in FSXThere is no Vanilla MP, so you have to download external plugins and create accounts.Much more less GA planes than in FSX with limited cockpit stillATC/ATIS voices on vanilla are wierd.Enjoy strugling with the sim for the best resolution-scale in your monitor.Very Very Very few airplanes and sceneries in the community, even the paywares.You feel in a ""dead"" world, different from FSX.Very VERY slow rate of updates and DLCs, almost non-existent.Overall: It could be a great sim but it still lacks LOTS of implementations concerning airplanes, sceneries, world textures, ambient ATC, ATC and the ATC.I believe that most players here would be proud to pay 100 or even 200$ for a flight sim with XP10 engine but with lots of sceneries, REALISTIC AND NUMEROUS AIRPLANES and a decent ATC and ambients..

												Unfortunately I can't recommend this game/simulator. As a base game compared to FSX (which is still the best flight sim unfortunately) it's not very good. I downloaded a ton of GB's of data and I don't know where it went but I don't see anything worth all the storage this application takes up. I just did a takeoff from KORD and there were trees in the middle of the runway. I don't know how/why this happens but that was the straw that broke the camel's back and when I decided to write this review. I wish every stock plane had virtual cockpit. The 2d cockpits on the models in the app are awful. I really regret spending $60 on this. Wish I saved the money and bought some payware for FSX. While this app does have better graphics, you can get mods for FSX to make it more realistic. I don't like that you can't (or maybe I just don't know how) communicate with ATC. FSX you can communicate with ground, tower, center, etc. so every flight feels like you're really flying even though the tower sounds like the computer from Wargames. I also like in FSX how it's easy to use the autopilot and NAV radios. Makes it easy to tune into ILS. The surroundings aren't that great either. Random buildings everywhere instead of actual landmark buildings. This definitely takes away from the realism of a sim. I spend all of my time on this app doing landings. That's one of the best things I've been doing with this app. Pick an airport, then it gives you 3 or 10 mile final. Loading times are a  pain in the butt and that's a shame. I'm on a 4790K and it still takes about a minute to go from ""launch"" on steam to getting to an airport. Anyway, If I were myself a couple of weeks ago (when I bought this app) I would advise myself not to buy it. I advise you not to buy it either. Spend the money you would have paid for this and buy some payware for FSX. Wish steam offered refunds because I would have done so about 2 hours after I started using this app.			"

												I've been flying X-Plane since version 7 and spent countless hours in the virtual cockpit of this simulator. I'm very please to see it on steam now, so that we don't have to carry 8+ DVDs anymore.X-Plane 10 is what it says on the tin. An extremely realistic flight simulator. I comes with a complete high-res world scenery package and a descent collection of standard aircraft out of the box. Yet it's not a game that takes your hand and tells you what to do. It's a flight simulator that requires some commitment to get the most out of it. You'll literally learn how to fly along the way.Like with other flight simulators the real power lays in modification. There are tons of free custom airport sceneries out on the web, many of which are quite stunning. The same goes for planes. For a long time free resources dominated X-Plane, yet in recent years high quality payware Add-Ons of stunning quality emerged, so that even the most pampered Flight Simulator use finds very well made airliners, photorealistic sceneries and so on.My setup consists of hundreds of custom airports, dozens of payware aircraft (mostly airliners) and a small array of tools like PFPX to do the flight planning. With that I conquer the world almost daily. For long flights I often chose the Flightfactor Boeing 777 while shorter hops are a lot of fun using one of Peters Aircraft A320 or A321 models. Looking for a realistic A380? No problem, there's one. More of a Boeing guy? Go forthe 747-8i then. Not into airliners at all? Have fun with the KingAir 200 or a Cessna Corvalis TT. Why not a Challenger 300 business jet for a change. Oh and there's the occasional flighter trip you can do for thrills at supersonic speeds. Too slow? Take the space shuttle for a few circles around the earth.My point here is that X-Plane 10 is what you make of it. It's an open world, literally, that allows you to fly as close to the real thing as you can get. It doesn't blow the budget on hardware (I run it with rather high setting on 500$ hardware!), yet doesn't have any limits to what it can take hardware wise as well. So whatever you throw at it, it will only look better.The weather engine is quite detailed. Weather may be generated at random, drawn out on a map or finetuned. Want the real weather? Just download it and don't forget to check your weather radar (yes there's one!)After years of using X-Plane I never grew tired of it. If you're looking for a modern, realistic, extendable and smooth running flight simulator, X-Plane is a great choice and I can only recommend it. If you're unsure, check out the official website for the free demo. Check out the community, which provides a lot of useful information and creates new resources, most of them free, on a daily basis.See you in the skies!			"

Planes, Scenery, instraments and adding aircraft are all over the internet to add to your Xplane, and make your use of it more educational and life like,, sorry to say with steam its not available to do this, Adding aircraft is a paid offer on here and the Scenery isnt the best option for this sim.

												This has the feel of a very, very unfinished product. Most aircraft have serious issues, from cockpit modes that are not present (most aircraft are buggy when switched to the 3D cockpit) to serious flyability issues (the Harrier VTOL aircraft seems to be missing any controls to rotate its wings or whatever it does to take off.) Helicopters seem to be absurdly unstable. I rather suspect that if real helicopters acted like this, they would only be used by adrenaline junkies looking for an extreme-sports rush.The airports also feel unfinished, lacking any refueling stations or options of any kind; it seems you can refuel only by opening the menu and cheating.Perhaps some of these issues could be remedied with ""plugins"" that you can pay extra for but I am not accustomed to seeing such basic gameplay mechanics relegated to DLC. I usually expect to get a fully functional game with my primary purchase, and then just get extra content via DLC.I still play this game but only because it supposedly has a very realistic flight model and I'd like to actually be a pilot someday but can't afford to take as many real-life lessons as I like. I hope I'm learning something useful here, not ruining myself.			"

												I tried the X-Plane 10 demo when it was released for the first time a few years ago. I did not purchase the program because of the low framerates and the very long loading times. I did not want to purchase the DVD set for the world scenery as well.Now X-Plane 10 is available on steam and I downloaded the demo again. I was impressed by the improved performance and the shorter loading times. I purchased the simulator this time and I like what I see.When you download X-Plane at first you only have the demo area available and you have to enable the included DLCs for the other regions of the world. Be prepared that many airports do not have a detailed scenery and you need to download further free scenery files to improve your experience.I recommend the X-Plane 10 flight simulator for enthusiasts that like to browse the web for addon scenery and aircraft. Casual users should definitly check out the demo first.			"

												I would give X-Plane a 3.5 out of 5. If you have played FSX, then you should be fine playing X-Plane but if you haven't I recommend playing FSX first. I really like how you can walk around your plane unlike FSX, I would just set it to autopilot and then sit in the back of my private jet lol. The only thing I really didn't like is the ATC and the flight route. In order to set the flight route I had to goto some website to generate the flight route file, move the file into the route folder somewhere on my desktop, and then load the flight route file into the plane which took me ages because there was so many buttons. And for the ATC I just gave up on that lol. Since the major cities don't look like the real world cities, I recommend getting some city scenery from Ted's X-Plane scenery site (Its free!).			"

												X-Plane 10 Global is a probably one of the most realistic flight simulators out there. Anyone looking to fly commerical aircraft will really enjoy this simulator. Steam members must realize that this simulator is not FSX and you will think that when you purchase it there is no airports. Please visit X-Plane.org and sign up. X-Plane.org has its own personal store with great addons for a great price. The website also has a huge database of downloads including top quality airports, airplanes and other typers of scenery. I give this simulator 5 stars because of the in depth feeling and the community base of addons. Another great point about the steam version of X-Plane 10 is not having to put a CD into the drive or having to buy a dongle to let you play without the cd. Steam members who have not played any other types of flight simulators this simulator is realistic to the point and will take a lot of learning. Give it time, get some addons from X-Plane.org and you will enjoy this simulator very much			"

												It's not cheap, but once you install all the planes and scenery and plugins you want (takes ages until you're happy with what you've got), and once you set the rendering options to something reasonable for your PC specs (this sim can easily melt most high end GPUs), nothing beats X-Plane for realism.Go to x-plane.org, find the downloads section and spend a few hours downloading the highest rated plugins, aircraft and airport models. Then go to simheaven.com to download real photoscenery and finally install Xsqauwkbox to connect to VATSIM for multiplayer.Recommended plugins: FlyWithLua (install 'real terra haze' script), Python (install ground services plugin), simcoders headshaker, airport navigator, visual altimeter, landing speed, enhanced runways hd.

Also, the CH products do not seem to calibrate well so I need to you my mouse.  Microsoft Flight Simulater's scenary was much closer to reality.

												Im going to give this simulation a thumbs up for being an overall realistic and having stunning beatiful graphics from the planes themselves to the luscious sceneries. The only negative to this positive is that fact that a lot of the extra aircraft you look for to add on to the simulation you have to pay extra for which is down right rediculous in my opinion considering you pay a good $60 just for the base simulation itself. Also there are alot of ""free"" aircraft and scenery out there to download but it can be a very tedious pain in the rear to even download those for the simulation. 9/10			"

												the best flight sim there is.  FSX? yeah, it's pretty in places, but it's buggy as balls and really old.  I also noticed the other day that you can't get a plane to flat spin!!This is not a game.  It can be played like one, I personally like taking up an F14 and flying from wales to Scotland as fast as I can, or racing halfway round the planet in an SR71, while listening to my favorite music on spotify.This is a SIMULATOR.  if you can do it in x-plane, it is possible in real life and the inverse applies.  The torque on a single prop craft will pull you to one side, meaning you have to trim the plane to get it to fly straight.  Control surfaces can be damaged by high speed or over G, the depth of this sim is amazing.Well worth the price, the full world scenery can be found in properties->dlc and ticking the boxes when you buy the game.

												I really wanted to love this game. I've been flying using FSX for many years, and I thought it was finally time to make the change. I saw the videos and loved the graphics, and was entranced by the claims of this simulator. On first start, loaded into KSEA. Everything looks great! Then I found out X-Plane has no preset joystick cofigurations. Cue 15 minutes of searching forms and wading through bloated menus just to get BASIC flight controls and simulator functions. Okay, it's whatever, I can get past it. Start flying, and my little Cessna is so out of trim, it's ridiculous! Try to find the trim controls within the honestly subpar VC, realize the camera controls aren't very intuitive either, spend another 5 minutes figuring that out. Okay, I think I solved the big issues, time to enjoy! Load up KMSN, the closest regional airport to me. I look around and there is nothing on the airport except pavement and tarmac. More forum searching. Find out that x-plane has accurate airport layouts, but is missing the wonderful airport autogen features in FSX, meaning about 23000 out of the stock 25000 airports in the game are simply 2D models with no buildings. That's it. I quit the game and do some more reading and am generally very unimpressed, uninstall and forget I bought it, and light my $60 on fire. tl;dr: Have high expectations for cool new flight simulator, have all of those hopes dashed inside of an hour.

												X-Plane 10 is by far the worst peice of software I've bought for a very long time.Having flown FSX for years and currently flying in DCS World, Il2 BOS and Il2 COD almost every day, I feel I have some experience of flight sims.My rig is a 6 core i7, 8 gigs of RAM, plus a Superclocked GTX780 and this game runs like a sticky turd. The fact that you need to download an extra 80 GBs of scenery files before you can fly anywhere else than the default area  wthout being surrounded by water. The fact that the cockpits look worse than games from 10 years ago. o.O The aircraft models are just as bad. I've seen better efforts from guys sat at home messing about with 3ds max. Using trackir in some cockpits means you don't even get to see any cockpit.Crashes everytime I exit the game.No missions whatsoever. Just some ""scenarios"". Including and I kid you not ""Take off from a grass strip"". IN FSX I was looking for lost aircraft in the mountains. In X-Plane I'm taking off from a grass strip. -_-The planes feel horrble in the air and on the ground they feel even worse.I couldn't find any way to configure my Warthog HOTAS to be collective or throttle depending on aircraft chgoice. I had to change it every time I switched aircraft. All in all, this is a terrible purchase. If I thought there was an easy way to do it, I would be demanding a refund. If you want a decent flight sim, FSX is still the choice for civilian flying and DCS World for military flying.Give X-Plane 10 a wide birth. Preferably at angels 20.If the advertising had mentioned this was a sim only, I would have saved by money.Fly safe.			"

												Overhyped, overpriced. Have spent all game time trying to get this to run in my monitor's native resoulution of 3840 x 2160 but the mouse pointer keeps dissapearing, which can only be rectified by deleting settings file. Cant use TAB or keyboard to navigate through the Hideous UI. Tried a test flight on default resoulution and the virtual world is poor even with the bundled europe scenery and the lack of 3rd party addons is another serious blow to this product. One of the most dissapointing purchases I ve made on steam so far. X-Plane 10 will reside in my 'Trash' folder along with Demolition Simulator and Viscera Clean Up Detail for the foreseeable future. I may reinstall in a year or so see if things have changed but for now I will stick with FSX, I suggest you do the same.			"

												I was so excited to get this game after a while playing fsx, looking for a more realistic sim with better graphics, but I was very disappointed in how anti-user friendly it is. Some of the planes dont even have 3D cockpits and are reused from older games. It's hard to program things like hat switches and joysticks, when in fsx I can just plug it in and it will recognize it. Again, disappointed. I already sent my refund request. Ths game should have sold for no more than 30 dollars.			"

												This game is ok if you know every thing about planes. It is very comlicated. The best thing about this game is the graphics. But the game does not have airports like shown in the videos. You need to download DLCs to have good airports. Overall the game is good, but not worth the $60 to buy the game. The game is be worth (in my opinion) betwwn $15 and $30. Only buy it if you are desprate for a plane simulator or if it has a big sale.			"

												I have played sims for a long time and been stuck on FSX for some time. I wanted to see a change and this is what happened: FSX destroys XP's hands down in every way possible other than being slightly less optimzed. Dont get me started on 3D-cockpits, the detail on it, and oh damn, will you be dissapointed. The FSX's stock 747 cockpit destroys XP's. Don't even get me started with the modded 747 version on FSX. And guess what, half of the stock planes in XP don't even have 3D cockpits.  The flight sim feels like a drunk man describe a sense of flying who flew once in aa light aircraft. This game just feels soul-less.  Stay away from this game, i'll stick to FSX. Waste of money get FSX for under 1/4th of the price.			"

												This review represents my own personal opinion about X-Plane 10.First off, I think it is inappropriate to put a 4 GB download onto the web for just the core of the simulator.It is a nice gesture to offer all the secenery addons via DLC for free. The downside is, at least for those with slower internet connection, it will take you a week to install the globe. The core download, about 4 GB, will give a few quadrants around seattle. Next disappointment is the Airports themself. There are absolutely no buildings e.g. gates and towers etc. Just a runway or whatever the number of runways there are. I have seen someone saying, you can build or modify the airports yourself, all you need is bunch of more software and a good understanding of how it works. Wait a moment, we just paid $60 for an incomplete software licsense and if you want the whole thing, finish it yourself?This sounds almost like, well let me have $60 and you can program it yourself?Away from the airports you'll see a richness of animated traffic and static objects, that I have to say. However, this is something if you only fly low altitude.What about the Jet liner? You'll take off and in no time you are at 10,000 feet, do I care what it looks like at 10000 feet? Absolutely not. When I land a jet, where do I do that? On the Airport e.g. runway. ATC instructs me to taxi to gate 11 and I will have to reply, what gate? The one I don't see or the one I will have to build first?Give me a break, thats where things happen, at the airport, what do we see? Absolutely nothing aside the runway!I had X-plane installed several years ago on a LINUX box. The plane's where almost impossible to taxi and take off with. Seems like there was always a storm with crossewinds of some sort, couldn't get it right no matter what. With the latest release, it seems it's the same, as it was with the more than 10 years old version that I had on a LINUX box, only with some more traffic in areas that I don't even see from an Airport. I am sorry, this version smells awfully like a ripoff and will get thumbs down from me.If I purchase software, I have absolutely no inclination to finish the product on my Computer. I want to explore and find out if it is worth to spend time to expand and enhance, but not finishing the software.X-plane 10 does not fulfill my expectation and will most likely wind up in the trash can. (Again)			"

												Excellent physics model (referenced by XKCD's Randall Munroe in ""What If?""), it blew Microsoft's Flight Simulator out of the water when it came on to the sim scene and rightly so.  The atmosphere effects are beautiful and the level of detail was asounding - although that level of detail came at a cost of very high system spec requirements.However, there is an open source alternative - FlightGear - which is free to download and has arguably better graphics, yet performs better on the same hardware.  It's hard to justify spending 50 quid on X-Plane these days when there is such a high quality competitor available.			"

												This was and is the first flight-sim I have bought and played. I was so excited when a ""modern-day"" flight sim came along, at least not A military flight sim. 1. Textures: Airports and cities have basically nothing besides a strip of tarmac and copy-paste of all of the buildings, which do not look great as is. I thought this would be normal for a game that has such an enourmous world size, but after comparing it to other sims this is definetly not the case. If you want a good-nice looking game out of box without having to download many types of freeware that are not compatible, this is definetly not the game for you.2. Mouse and keyboard: I currently play with a ""CH Products Flight Sim Yoke"" which works perfecttly well on most of my games on my mac(yes unfortunetly I do not have a gaming PC YET. But this is another reason I was limited to Xplane instead of FSX or other sims.) When I tried flying the stock cessna with a mouse and keyboard I apperently can fly like a blue angels pilot or have broken physics. The ability to make 60 degree turns with the slide of a mouse in under a second was insane and if you are looking for a game where you can do that, knock yourself out, but I am writing a review for a flight sim, not a game. 3. No tutorials: Like I said, first flight sim. I had very little knowledge of how to use the given aircraft and had to go through many youtube tutorials to understand the basics of the sim. If we again compare this to FSX, we can see why this is an extreme downfall.4. Very Simple AI: The AI can do about 3 things1) take an hour to take off announcing 10 times that they are crossing a certain runway2)mimic your aircraft to simulate ""formation flying"" which responds the exact second you do and looks like a copy-paste onto the screen.3) attempt to land5. very confusing control tower clearences and controls: Control towers are extreamy hard to find and when you do they are rather difficult to understand given that there are no tutorials. I understand that this isn't a sim that is ment to teach you everything about flying, but not being to understand any of the commands coming up to takeoff given by the control tower becomes annoying.What needs to happen for this sim to be ""fixed""1. Include many new textures of the land, airports, and surrounding cities FOR FREE, I paid $60.00 for this, I mean come on!2.Realistic mouse controls3.Tutorials on just the basics. Takeoff and tower communication. Preflight checks, actual takeoff, radar control, auto pilot, etc.4.AI that respond well with control towers and edited to quite an extent5. Have a control tower at each major airport and use tutorials to enable everyone to communicate and understand orders and information well.			"

Nothing.All settings are overwhelming with plenty of checkboxes and sliders. But only few of them are really needed in a game. Not any hints or tips about any control settings - to find out what every type of control does, you need a plane, that have this control and a lot of time to try it out.Massively supports special hardware - controllers, flight displays and so on. Does anyone have these at home an mass?If you want to teach someone to fly (create a cockpit), and have good amount money to buy special hardware, hire instructors and teachers - this is your product.If you want to play flying sim - no. Definitely no.			"

There is not any sense of lag and it seems to be at 35 to 50 FPS when I play so ya go and buy this sim its worth checking out. This flight simulator is a big improvement over x plane 9 and if your laptop/computer is not fit to run x plane 10 you can buy x plane 9 here instead: https://secure.ultracart.com/checkout/singleLoad.do?r=1482615571790&merchantId=MEYER&_ga=1.6221811.1700452553.1482430929 .

But What it didn't tell you is that: 1) You need a joystick (or it is hard to control the aircraft)2) Bigger aircrafts (777) have no 3D-Cockpit3) It has to install all the worlds scenery (which takes an extra 3 days to install)4) It has few airports, you have to buy more if you want5) If you want extra, you have to pay for the extra scenery, aircraft.. etc.I had very high expectations after the week it was downloading, but then i found you need a joystick to control the aircraft properly and there was no 3D-Cockpit in airliners!

												If you consider that out of the box FSX, with its smaller disc footprint, includes huge numbers of landmarks and fun places to fly around, you would be forgiven for thinking X-plane 10 would, judging from its elphantine footprint, be much better. Instead you are required to spend a week downloading external files just to add the most famous world buildings. X-plane 10 is simply not a finished product. In the past it may have been reasonable to have the community help with developing it, but after all this years, X-plane is nothing more than a scrounger living off the hard work of others.If you want to fly IFR between far flung places, x-plane is great. If you to enjoy great landmarks of the real world, forget it.The X-plane community defend this shoddy behaviour like rabid fan-bois - ""If you're not willing to spend some time setting it up, then you aren't serious."" Well folks, selling a game for £45 (and yes, this is a game, not a simulator!) and not including the most basic of famous landmarks makes X-plane very much a pre-release product. Having read about the main ""personality"" running the x-plane franchise, I should have known. So, enjoy your ""hyper real"" joyless simulator. One day you will learn, the fun is buzzing the ground and scraping landmarks with your wings just centimeters from disaster, not flying everywhere at 40,000ft or over a landscape which all looks like Oklahoma - but with less movement and shorter trees.Oh, and one day you'll try an actual simulator and realised you wasted a large part of your life on a pale imitation.

												Recently converted from fsx to a ""More realistic"" x-plane. And oh jesus.. Wtf is this!? Throughout the small number of hours ive played, ive experienced:>Being randomly spawed sideways onto a runway>AI being SPAWNED INSIDE my plane sideways on the runway>AI taxiiing on the GRASS instead of the RUNWAY>AI DISSAPEARING INTO NOWHERE> God aweful yaw physics> Auto leveling wings in some aircraft at lowlevel flight (unflyable because the plane literally auto levels if you try to turn)>Most community made planes have bare cockpit functions (90% of PLANES them i cant EVEN turn the engines off because the switches are UNCLICKABLE) > Aircraft pulling left/right on runway for NO REASON (I endup on the grass when taking off because... XPLANE PHYSICS)>Tire screaches and smoke when SLOWLY turning and taxiing in some aircraft> Barely any freeware planes, forcing you too buy PAYWARE> BARON MAJOR AIRPORTS. Yes, BARON. Decided to check out toronto pearson INTL... But there were NO airport buildings AND barely any traffic.. just completly flat (even 9y/o FSX managed to have scenery for ALL fairly sized and big airports)>Barely any selection of aircraftBut.. i did encounter some good things:> Sweet night graphics and lights>Good aircraft and ground scenery detail>Good Graphics>Good optimisation (60fps on max)>Decent audio >sloped/uneven runways (favorite bit about xplane)Cant recomend if you looking to move on from FSX, just DONT do it			"

												I want a refund.  This game might be worthwhile if you don't have to play it throught the steam program.  The control over the game is limited, and it is extremely slow to load.  I had microsoft flight sim x previously and it was much better. The graphics on this game are not impressive at all, and controls are difficult,  and the flying characteristics are not realistic, which may be due to the lag caused by playing a game online which has to be run through another program(steam).

												I was getting bored of Microsoft Flight Simulator and I wanted a more realistic, more modern sim. So I thought this would be the perfect sim because of the videos and reviews. I bought it for £45 which is a lot of money but I thought it would be worth the money. So I waited around 2 hours for it to download. When it finally downloaded I clicked play and a littele menu popped up. I clicked the 64 bit as my pc is 64 bit. It started loading through all of the loading screens. Then, a little window opened and it said that the game has crashed and said to make a comment to help. I then tried the 32 bit and the same happened. So now im gonna have to search all of the forums to find a solution.....			"

Unfortunately, I am not able to get a refund back from Steam because as played more than 2 hours.Albeit the majority was spent addjusting settings and to find how to Navigate.In Summary if you are confident with VOR - VOR Navigation, then it maybe suited for you. - Personally myself not for me, and I dont think I will be rushing to get X Plane 11, you cant even create a flight plan like you can on FSX SE, before I consider X Plane again these simple things need to be updated			"

												I would rate this higher than maybe a zero.\, just slightly.  I purchased the ""game"" and have nothing but technical issues.  Constantly recieve notices that the Open GL is not able to launch.  I do not run an anti virus software when playing games online.  so that killls that critism from others.  I gave the program full Admin rights.  Kills that one too.  I have read past reviews were others seem inclined to attack anyone who rights a bad review.  The software is hard to use and offers poor instruction, have to feel your way through like a blind man.  It does not give a true sense of flying out of a controlled airport, when you can ""choose"" to ignor ATC.  The ability to easly use any instrument was lost with poor interface.  The ability to easly look around the flight deck was also missed, with poor instruction provided.   The programming was made to make money, if you leave the provided scenery area, you enter water world.  Don't worry, they provide a pop up in mid flight to inform you of this.  Again not too realistic, couldn't even write in default scenery.  I would give a better review if the ""game"" was set up to be more user friendly.  Flight simulators don't give you THE SR-71 and so forth.			"

												In my opinion I would recommend that you DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!The game is absolute rubbish and is lacking in pretty much every department. Having read many reviews and watched endless videos of this game I took the plunge and purchased it. I had already considered that to make this game look like a half presentable flight sim I would have to do some addon hunting, however, after 2 days of downloading and installing many recommended addons the game still does not even come close to FSX/P3D. The scenery does not even vaguely resemble the areas/cities you are flying over and the airfields may as well be a field with some cows in them which in my opinion completely defeats the object of a flight sim. At least with FSX/P3D you can get ORBX for example which looks great and gives you some landmarks to fly by.Save your money and get P3D in my opinion and spend your money on some good addons. "

												I paid 60 US$ for X-Plane 10.3 in October 2014.If Steam had a refund-button I would use it.I do NOT recommend X-Plane in its current state.If this was the year 2002 X-Plane would be up to current standards, but this is 2014 and today you can find even free simulators that are better than X-Plane.In fact, there is not much realism to be found in X-Plane (except that it's expensive, just like real flying)The good:- The runways. They look good and fairly realistic when you're lined up for take-off at night. Seeing the lights on the sloped runway appears quite well-done.- The cars on the roads, at night, look pretty realistic (but taxes the system quite heavily, which basically makes it useless)The bad:Everything else.A few examples:- The clouds look like nothing I've seen on planet Earth = unrealistic.- The cockpits are alpha-status. Gauges are missing and when they are there some of them doesn't actually work. For example; the heading-bug in the King-air (a default aircraft and not a 3rd party aircraft!) can't go from 350 degrees to 010 degrees unless you turn it counter-clockwise. The NAV1 Locator shows negative degrees (puts a minus in front of the degree number) if you turn it past 360 degrees counter-clockwise. Not even Flight-sim 98 by Microsoft was this buggy (and that was in 1997!)- The aircraft are not optimized for typical PC-joysticks, so the control of the aircraft does not compare to the same levels of work-load and stress-level that you feel in a real similar type. There also is no force-feedback (not even a simple stick-shaker or runway-rumble shaker which even FSX had in 2006) so you have no feeling for what the aircraft is doing in relation to ground or air-flow.I also want to mention the menus, although they're obviously not related to flight-realism. When you see the menus... you just can't help but feel it's a crazy person who made this sim. For example; if you want to turn the sloped runways off you get a pretty nutty pop-up text about how X-Plane is so much more 'awesome' (a word the X-Plane author seems to use a lot) than FSX because of these runways. A lot of the graphic-settings also has options such as 'Burn your CPU' or 'Too much' or 'Siberian winter'... it's really a joke to see something like this in a 60$, supposedly FAA-certified, simulator.So, to sum it up, if you want realism from your flight-sim... X-Plane 10.3 is NOT the best choice in my opinion. It's more than 10 years behind current technology standards for home-PC flight-simulators.I do feel cheated paying 60 bucks for this incomplete software.			"

												I was very dissapointed with this game.  For something claiming to be the most realistic/accurate flight simulator - it ended up failing on so many levels.  From first launch you are on the runway in a plane with no concept of what buttons control it or how to customize your flight.  There is no configuration utility to map out a controller, instead you have to set up each function individually which can be a pain-staking and time consuming process.    The default physics were very awkward as well.  Planes would repeatedly pull to the right when taxiing and collisions were disabled so the plane would just do cartwheels through the countryside and then resume it's take-off attempt.  The only things I would put in the plus column are having the SR-71 as a stock plane, as well as having the option to launch from a B-52.  In all other aspects I still rate FSX as a superior title.

												Terrible game, if your a FSX player don't buy this game because its not as in depth as FSX.  Graphics are decent but not as good as what they should be for today's simulator.  There is no scenery for the airport that I flew out of, I tried MSP I see nothing just the runways.			"

												Been using this sim for a while, but took a long break from it.  I'm back in it with version 10 and I'm sorely disappointed with it.  It freezes every flight with different planes and different plugins.  I've logged a lot of time with it, 44 hours to date, and I haven't completed one flight yet without it freezing up.  I cannot reproduce the freezes other than flying around - sometimes it freezes when I look at the map, sometimes it freezes when I'm banking, sometimes it just freezes when the aircraft is flying straight and level in autopilot without any input from me.  X-Plane's support and forums are of no help either.  The logs are of no help, they just stop before the freeze happens.  This wasn't a problem with version 9.  Don't waste your money until these guys fix it.			"

												It's not kidding... what you see is what you get (and I have yet to find anything else). I know they said you can get additional content for the game, but I am having the hardest time finding anything. On the X-Plane’s site, I find options to purchase X-Plane and the USB key… That is all; otherwise, I am just stuck with one skin for my plane. I absolutely LOVE the United 747 (but you’re just suck with that one 747 as an example)  =’( Okay, so firstly, the graphics, the actual physics of the plane (micro stuff), and the lack of lag are AMAZING (All the things FSX lacks). I have a decent gaming PC, and despite some patches of “not responding” during loading time, the game runs quite fluidly on very high-detail settings.However, the controls SUCK, the realism SUCKS, and I have yet to find the multi-player (if it exists). Many of the planes I have tried to fly are buggy, or just do not work at all. Like the space shuttle for example, it is not even running on the runway when it spawns, so I tried to add fuel, and it will not even let me do that. Some planes feel like they are loaded to capacity by bricks, meanwhile others are tossed around like toys by the controls. To be honest, I’m terrified that they train real pilots off this game. The controls are never precise and it feels like I’m flying the plane willy-nilly on my tablet.The X-Plane (Liminar Research) folks need to get together with the Microsoft folks and they could make a TRULY AMAZING game! With X-Plane’s graphics and Microsoft’s UI + Realism, I’d be more than happy to pay a hefty sum for that game.The user-interface in X-Plane is not user friendly at all. You have to clamor through a whole ton of menus with high hopes that you understand the geek-language and manually set your joystick buttons. I have a joystick, throttle quadrant, and a set of rudder-pedals. I had to manually program ALL the buttons and axes for the game. Personally, I was able to accomplish this part with slight stress, but I feel it would be almost impossible for the average person who is new to flight simulators.During flight, it is as if the game “forgets” some of my pre-programmed buttons and usually replaces it with something random. The “Lights” button becomes a “Pan-Left” button for example.At the end of the day, it is as if the game just does whatever it wants. I was en-route to an airport and I wanted to check the map (to see where I was). BEWARE OF MIS-CLICKS!! I clicked “global map” instead of “local map” and all of a sudden, I was in a different aircraft at some RANDOM airport. There is no warning message for things like this, but tons of warning messages for the scenery that you have to spontaneously know how to download as DLC vs. coming with the game as it should. The redeeming quality is that the DLC comes free with the game, YAY.I am still new to X-Plane, but I have been playing flight simulators for over 10 years, and I ""like"" this game, but feel VERY disappointed by it!

												ok, I love flight sims, but I love them more when they have easily accessible instructions and settings menus.  This sim is possibly the most user unfriendly sim I have ever played.  The Graphics are lovely (as seen speeding skew off a runway and into the buildings!), but I can't recommend it to anyone who is new to sims (or anyone who expects to be able to adjust the sim either in menu- or in game).  I guess its back to the 128 page manual.  Bummer, I am sure It will get easier... at some point.			"

I would not reccomend this game for people who dont find paint drying entertaining... I wish I could return it except its trash and steam is good at selling trash and not giving money back for the trash they sell. The quality is awful ! NOT WHAT THEY ADVERTISE AT ALL! No animations at all ! I don't see what they were doing for 20 years?! I highly doubt they ever spent 20 years it looks like they made this with unity 3d from 1990. There are maybe 2 or 3 animations the joystick, smoke and spinning tires. This just a phony game posted by steam which I wouldn't doubt that steam put this at the top just for the sales.

												One of the best sims out there, the flight modelling is superb in the air and on the ground. Landing and taking off seem more realistic than other known sims especially with the help of non-flat runways and great ground friction. Although I don't fly the included aircraft, I use the DLC or other payware planes because the quality of them makes the sim even better. There are plenty of third party add-ons for this sim.One thing I do struggle with is the clouds, they aren't as pretty as you would hope, but flying through them feels really nice. This sim uses ""blade element theory"" for flight dynamics which basically means airflow over the surfaces of the aircraft are simulated in a certain way. That also means with the included aircraft builder you can test out your own designs. This is not something I am into though, I just like to fly.I could say more but I'll keep it short, this is probably the best sim you can get in 64 bit too. "

												This is a great engine! Stable and very well made, the problem is... You are just buying the engine with a couple of mediocre airplane models, which only a couple of them have a virtual cockpit. (which are horribly detailed) If interested in having a decent simulation experience, be prepared to buy a couple of airports (at least $20 each) and some aircraft (same, at least $20 each but expecto around $80 for a real good one.)If you are planning on playing this game stock, I recommend FSX, much much better experience stock. If you got the $$$, go for it! XP10 is a great engine! And with the right investments you will enjoy it deeply. I must say tho, the default scenery is superb! There is no clear winner between XP10 and FSX at the moment, both have what the other is missing, worth every penny to own both! (Actually, don't get FSX, get P3D instead)			"

												From a user with over a decade of flight simulator experience, I highly recommend X-Plane. I have spent most of my time on FSX and previous Microsoft iterations. It took me a good while to make the switch to X-Plane, but I would never go back. It is highly optimized for 64 bit operating systems and runs very well with today's higher-end computers. Every flight simulator has its issues, but after 250 hours on X-Plane, I can assuredly say it is my favorite flight simulator.			"

												Occasionally I fly the Cessna 172, that came with the game, in order to help me better understand aeroodynamics, flight instruments and the procedures of starting engine, landing, and take off. And so far, this ""tool"" or ""game"" helped me apply certain techniques without having to try them in real life. To put it simply, I've learned a lot through X-plane 10 (and there is so much to learn and to memorize).X-Plane 10 itself is bland and requires some user-side effort to make it more ""visionally"" appealing to the eye (airport updates, cloud modifications, etc.). Nonetheless, the important elements such as weather, aerodynamics and instrument accuracy is there. Consequently you might have to pay a bit extra for the higher quality planes if you desire to learn more about other planes.			"

												Allow me to explain a few things about this game and how I found it. First off, I use a macbook, and I intended to find a flight simulator without using programs such as bootcamp (I used Flight Simulator X previously). And so I did what any sensible person would do, and searched Steam. And I found this little gem. Now this game has no-where near as good an interface as FSX, but both have a great modding community and very realistic and sensitive controls. The look of this game is better apart from the fact that it doesn't display cities as accurately as FSX, landmarks etc. it still has very good graphics and allows generation of animals on the ground which, though not interactive, scare the player when you're trying to take off and deer run on the runway. The buildings in FSX are crashable, in this game they are not, but considering that you're going to fly for most of the time, it doesn't really matter.Multiplayer capabilities are a bit worse than FSX, requiring port-forwarding and modem configuration to join the servers, but the servers you join are living breathing actual communites for actual flight with passengers, flight training, and what not, while on FSX people are genrally trying to recreate 9-11.This game is a great alternative to FSX in more ways than one, and if you know how to reconfigure your modem, I recommend flying multiplayer on one of the many servers.

												This is better seen as a serious Flight Simulator Software Package than a Flight Sim Game. Some of the sounds are a bit unrealistic and dull to listen to; for instance, the engines all have poor quality sounds to them - pistons and jets.The graphics are fine, and they are not too taxing on an average computer if you use a decent quality graphics. Some of the planes are pretty good, and fun to fly, but I can see some flaws in some of the aircraft.Helicopters- Intuitively speaking, I do not feel that the helicopters accuratley resemble rotorcraft flight for me. I think that the torques are a bit too exaggerated; do you ever find yourself in a helicopter constantly slamming your pedals, and fighting against the helicopter?I think with the GA aircraft, the flying itself is not inconsiderably less smooth than I would expect from a GA aircraft.Some of the cockpits are OK, but most of them are just dreadful. A lot of the planes do not even have a 3D cockpit, and quite a few of the 2D cockpits are just uniform and dull. The PlaneMaker does require some getting used to. I struggle to build a plane in that which is even stable on the ground.			"

												Might have silly flaws but at the end of the day you can legit fly at great framerates unlike FSX. I love FSX but the framerates are the worst. On top of that, there are a lot of free legit add-ons for this. Night flying is amazing as well. If you max everything out there's a good possibility you can actually recognize and follow roads. I flew almost 100 miles doing that which is pretty impressive for a video game in reality.  Stay away from helos... they are impossible... lol!			"

												X-Plane : Right out of the box (as it were) the 64 bit version beats hands down in speed and looks FSX. FSX looks dated (it is) and needs a significant cost investment to bring the ground textures up to some reasonable level. Still, no matter your system  performance will suck if you intend to crank up the textures. And HUGE ISSUE whether with FSX or Prepar3D is OOMs. Yes, the dreaded out of memory errors. Say goodbye to that with X-Plane at 64 bit. Now first big minus in XPlane - NO SEASONAL TEXTURES!. Go ahead, fly in Canada in winter. Look - summer textures,lol. So you'll need to get a program for this huge deficiency.There is a growing body of payware for X-Plane and some fabulous planes such as the 777 and Flightfactor A350. Also the payware scenery, though nowhere near FSX/Prepar3D is starting to provide the necessary content to bring realism.UPDATE: Now updating my review. Giving thumbs up now because the first real attempt to provide a capable traffic AI - X-Life. The Deluxe version includes full ATC, flightplanning, follow-me car, etc. There is a growing body of airports which implements traffic AI through this program. Bravo. All of a sudden there is now a decent traffic program. Nowhere near Ultimate Traffic for P3D but well on its way.There is also another decent ATC proram called pilot2ATC which is for XPlane and P3D.			"

												I'm really enjoying this. FSX crashes on me all the time after a few minutes of flight so I gave X-Plane a whirl and could not be happier. I am not a pilot, do not know how to fly, have no idea what the controls (besides basic roll, pitch, yaw, throttle) yet love hopping into a flighter jet, taking off my my home airfield, zoom through the clouds and just flying around. There are a lot of talented people on Twitch and YouTube who fly the heavies and that is what I would like to be able to do one day in this game. Fly from one airport, navigate to another and safely land. Highly recommended. Just upgrade to the free HD Mesh that is available and download some cool planes and airports.			"

												Very realistic simulator, but ONLY with an excessive amount of plugins and scenery packs that should be included. Realism in cockpit it very good, almost every button/switch is useable. X plane 10 lacks multiplayer mode. airports are unrealistic. Only thing that makes this better than fsx is the usability of all of the switches in the cockpit. I would still reccomend this over FSX though as FSX is more of a noobs/basic version of FSX. (BTW, I have over 60 hours logged on FSX)			"

												This is a SIMULATOR, not a game!Note that the planes and scenery that comes with the simulator are not the best. Almost everything has been automatically generated and only a few areas have been created by hand. This means that most airports look the same and some have quite weird layouts etc. But all of this can be improved upon with mods and addons. So, if you want a world class flight simulation, then get it, but you must be prepared to get additional mods and aircraft (there are a lot of both freeware and payware options) to make the simulator really shine.

												for anyone interested in giving x-plane 10 a shot should try it, i have been an fsx user for almost 10 years and i use both, but lately been spending more of my time in x-plane, both sims are good in there own way, but what i like about x-plane is the huge amount of freeware that you can get for x-plane 10, i had tried previous versions of x-plane and couldnt get into it, but after grabbing the flight factor a350,757,777 and the free hd v3 scenery, i am having alot of fun with xplane, also the fact x-plane 10 supports 64 bit now gives you unlimited use to your ram,i recently bought skymaxx pro, maxx fx, and the shared co pilot and now me and friends can do a flight together in several heavy aircrafts.many addons that you would have to buy for fsx or p3d, are either already built into x-plane 10 or free.to compare i have spent about 2,000 on software for fsx over the years, and have spent about 300 to get xplane looking the way fsx looks now,another big plus is you caan use x-plane 10 on linux and mac along with windows of course because its open gl, the more cpu power, ram and vram you have x-plane will not let it go to waste.my advise is don't just try it once after you buy it, give it a few weeks before you decided you don't like it, it took me a week to get use to the controls as they are like ezdok for fsx, i garantee 80% of you will really enjoy this sim, i know i do and if more people use xplane, more developers will start to notice, good luck everyone, i hope this helps.

												Alright, I've had XP 8, 9, and now 10. These are serious flight sims and not for kids expecting Ace Combat or an equivalent thereof where you can just load it and start fighting other aircraft, etc. I will break down the pros and cons:PRO:+More accurate flight models (i.e. I can finally do Pugachev's Cobra in my SU-35 without unrealistic altitude gain).+Can target all flying aircraft (for those days where shooting down an airliner gives you jollies).+Black smoke upon missle hits/Explosions for bombs.+Better graphics+Better supersonic modeling (much less computational flutter)+At full tilt, I can recognize my neighborhood (better world detail).+Wing flexing! (Finally)+Faster batch-converting for airfoils.Mixed:+/- Better AI for air combat but still no gun usage for OPFOR aircraft or complex manuevers. I know this isn't a combat sim but can someone make a plug-in for this? It'll be great for those bad days at the office when you just want to recreate a battle from the Korean War.CON:-Super complicated to get older aircraft up to the new version.-When you get older aircraft up to xp10, a huge amounts of adjustments needed in planemaker to get these aircraft flyable.-Air Traffic Control is junk, just worthless. Even if you set your comms right.-Requires extensive knowledge of previous XP versions to get any custom aircraft airworthy.-Only diehard flightsim fans will have the patience to figure out the complicated variables needed to fly this sim.-Generic modern-standard radar navigation systems, older aircraft can see like new ones without scan deflection restrictions and analogue vs digital system limitations.I love the X-plane series and I'm glad it is on Steam. It makes it easier than waiting for the store to carry the Full version than the boiled-down North American version. Hopefully fixes will be addressed in later patches.I recommend this only for diehard sim fans. Those expecting Ace Combat arcade action are going to be vastly disappointed.			"

												This game has a bit of a learning curve but once you figure out the basics it get's pretty easy from there. For me here are the main points to learn: Take off and landing Navigation and use of the GPS Learning ILS landingsOnce you get those things down it's pretty easy from there. I do highly recommend not trying to play this with a mouse though it is possible.There are tons of add ons and graphics updates that are totally free. Of course the payware stuff you can get is good but it is not needed to enjoy the game. You can make the game look amazing for free, heck even the stock install looks nice.I did make the plunge and buy a payware plane and I did not regret it for a second, it was so well done and detailed. I was really happy with the purchase.I recomend this game to any sim fan out there, it is a good buy.			"

												Ignore the negative reviews, this is a simulator with some novel add ons.  Once you get connected to the x-plane community you can download for free just about any airport or anything that flys or premium addons for a price.It is quite accomadating to what you want; I've enjoyed learning how to use the autopilot features, such as tuning in the GPS Nav points localizors and all the complicated stuff I have no clue about.  fly where you want or log a flight path and follow the instructions of the ATC from gate, Taxi, take off, the flight to landing and to the gate of the destination airport.I've never tried Microsoft flight simulator X, so I can't compare.  I already had x-plane 9, so when this was on steam at a great price it was a definite grap.Can take a lot of space to have entire planet scenary plus addon scenary and aircraft, my x-plane 9 folder was over 60gig.I love pretending to be a airline pilot so if you're like me X-plane 10 wins!!!!!

												X-plane 10 is a good sim that runs on even my low spec (125mb Video) mac quite well - with low graphics. It looks fine, and only takes 3 or 4 minutes to load, even with the obscene amount of scenery I've loaded. I find freeware - especially from the x-plane.org - is very good, and I can't really complain about lack of good planes.Pros:-Runs well-Looks alright, especially with a powerful machine-Lots of planes/scenery to download, easy to addCons-No missions like in FSX-Pretty poor UX-Big file, when base scenry is just autogen			"

												The advertising may be false and the game may be Ok but, they really improved the games lag in the steam edition.  I myself owned X-plane 10 for mac and the lag was horrendous, after buying a 4gb ram windows computer which isn't the best, I decided to move to steam edition...  I already have payware aircraft for this game like the flight factor 777 & 757, but there are some good freeware aircraft out there.  The controls are decent, and it runs a lot faster, also, thank god there is no more ""CD 1 required"" when you run the game anymore, that ruined the gameplay....  This game is pretty pricey, but if you have an average computer and love great looking flight sims and don't mind the sound effects, you wll love this game... but FSX is more cheaper with better sound effects and aircraft if you want that alternative, but the FSX graphics aren't as good as XP10 in default...

												This is quite a good game, once you can get to grips with its quirks. However, it really pays to have some experience with flight simming (or even real piloting), because this game is NOT novice-friendly. Unlike Microsoft Flight Simulator X, which has tutorial missions and a wealth of information in its Learning Center (including detailed information about how to fly its default aircraft), X-Plane basically throws you in the cockpit and says ""best of British"" to you. There are no tutorials, at least not within the game. It doesn't work all that well ""out of the box"", either. You have to spend some time configuring it (especially with regard to your controller). This is good in some ways, because X-Plane offers a lot of options for customisation and is very flexible in this regard. But in other ways, it's a bit tedious, especially as the user interface is not very user-friendly. Granted, there are plenty of forums where you can get good information, but it would be nice to have more of the information you really need within the game itself.The scenery (minus any add-ons) is somewhat of a mixed bag. In terms of topography, X-Plane leaves FSX in the dust. The way in which hills, fields and so on are rendered is every bit as good as high-quality FSX scenery add-ons like Orbx or texture add-ons like REX. Water and lighting are also quite magnificent. Runways are (at least in my opinion) easier to see. Weather is very well done. However, where X-Plane trails a fair way behind FSX (and I think, Prepar3D) is in the way airports are depicted - often just bare runways and taxiways with no buildings at all. This is really very poor. Cities are not very well depicted either. While FSX default rendering of cities is pretty ordinary, it is still, at this time, vastly superior to X-Plane (again, I refer purely to default scenery - obviously, the scenery of both these flight sims can be improved with add-ons).Another area where X-Plane falls short of FSX is AI aircraft. While it is nice to see real airlines (like United) instead of the generic airlines you get in FSX, the type of aircraft are often wrong for the airport. For instance, at my home airport (which is a major international airport, but has a fairly short runway), I saw a United Airlines Boeing 747. United doesn't fly to my city, and the runway is too short for 747s. Even more absurdly, I saw a NASA 747! Another crazy sight I saw was a Hercules (or something similar) doing all manner of weird somersaults before eventually righting itself and rolling down the runway for takeoff. AI aircraft in FSX aren't perfect, but they never do that! And the aircraft type is usually correct for the airport you're at. So this is another area of X-Plane that really needs some work.As for your own aircraft, they have nice interiors and decent flight dynamics. More 2D pop-up panels would be helpful though (maybe add-ons provide these, but the default planes don't seem to, except for the Garmin GPS), and sometimes the instruments can be hard to read. Sure, you can zoom in on them, but then how are you supposed to see outside? Things like radios and the altimeter have be adjusted manually, but this is not too hard to do. Autopilots are a bit tricky. By the way, for looking around, I recommend using the mouse (zoom in and out with the scroll wheel, and hold down the right button to pan around). Much better than the keyboard. There's also your joystick's hat switch, but you have to manually configure this (X-Plane won't recognise your joystick the way FSX will), which is not that easy. By far and away the best way to look around, or zoom in and out, is with the mouse.One thing I enjoy doing a lot in FSX is IFR flights between one place and another. It's very straightforward to create a flight plan in FSX. generate a navigation log and interact with ATC. You can do IFR flights in X-Plane as well, but it's far less straightforward (though I'm sure there are add-ons to make it easier). In FSX, you can search for a depature point by airport name, ICAO code or city. Likewise for your destination. But when filing a flight plan in X-Plane, you can only enter the ICAO codes for your departure and arrival points. I guess it's not too hard to look these up somewhere, but this is an example of how X-Plane is not friendly to newbies. Then too, you have to enter a route comprising VORs, DMEs or whatever (although you can leave this section blank and just fly direct, which is best for short flights). But it's not entirely clear how you should do this, what format it should take etc. There's no navigation log, which I love in FSX and really miss in X-Plane. Another thing to beware of is that X-Plane won't park your aircraft at a departure point the way FSX does. You have to choose your airport and gate/ramp BEFORE setting up a flight plan, and you will be returned to that same spot once you're done with your flight plan.Interacting with ATC takes a bit of getting used to in X-Plane. Whereas FSX will automatically tune you to your departure airport's Clearance Delivery frequency to get you started, you have to manually find the frequency in X-Plane. Better realism, granted, but it can be rather disconcerting at first. Actually, there is a rather handy trick that can help you with ATC in X-Plane. Go to the ""Special"" menu and select Toggle ATC (that's not exactly what it's called, but anyway it's about halfway down the Special drop-down menu). This brings up a little yellow box that you can use to ""auto-tune"" frequencies (select the ""recommended"" one). When ATC says something to you, make sure that you acknowledge their transmission or they'll just keep repeating themselves ad nauseam. Another thing X-Plane's ATC will do is tell you you're off course when you've just taken off and are flying the runway heading to gain a safe altitude, but are (temporarily) going in the opposite direction to your destination. This is quite annoying and I hope it will be fixed. Note also that ATC won't tell you to change course after you've taken off. They expect you to know where you're going (a novel concept). But when you are getting closer to your arrival airport, they will give you altitude and heading instructions that more closely resemble what the FSX ATC does. And I actually think the vectoring of X-Plane's ATC may be a little more precise.If you are a complete and utter novice to flight simming, you would be better off starting with FSX or the upcoming Dovetail Games Flight School. Certainly in FSX, you can learn a LOT about the fundamentals of flying. X-Plane does not teach you these fundamentals and frankly throws you in the deep end. But if you DO understand the basics of flying (or indeed have reasonable experience with FSX and/or Prepar3D) and you can get the hang of X-Plane's interface (which is a learning curve in its own right), and if you can live with the weird AI aircraft behaviour and total lack of buildings at many airports, then X-Plane is well worth investing in, especially for its topography rendering, weather and aircraft flight dynamics. So I recommend it, albeit with a few caveats.			"

												I'm really enjoying this. FSX crashes on me all the time after a few minutes of flight so I gave X-Plane a whirl and could not be happier. I am not a pilot, do not know how to fly, have no idea what the controls (besides basic roll, pitch, yaw, throttle) yet love hopping into a flighter jet, taking off my my home airfield, zoom through the clouds and just flying around. There are a lot of talented people on Twitch and YouTube who fly the heavies and that is what I would like to be able to do one day in this game. Fly from one airport, navigate to another and safely land. Highly recommended. Just upgrade to the free HD Mesh that is available and download some cool planes and airports.			"

												Very realistic simulator, but ONLY with an excessive amount of plugins and scenery packs that should be included. Realism in cockpit it very good, almost every button/switch is useable. X plane 10 lacks multiplayer mode. airports are unrealistic. Only thing that makes this better than fsx is the usability of all of the switches in the cockpit. I would still reccomend this over FSX though as FSX is more of a noobs/basic version of FSX. (BTW, I have over 60 hours logged on FSX)			"

												When I got X-plane 9 when I was around 8 years old, XP has been one of my favorite games since the start. My love for aviation and the goal of becoming a pilot increased because of this game. I originally had the Xplane 10 phsyical disk and I always couldn't wait get home to play it after school. Because of how much I loved the simulator, I rebought the game on steam when I got a new PC, so I could play it more with all of my friends on VATSIM, which I have done ever since. I toured aviation universities; one being Embry Riddle, which primarily uses XP10 as their simulator for all of their students in training.This game is surely worth the pricetag, and I ensure you X-plane 11 will be amazing too			"
