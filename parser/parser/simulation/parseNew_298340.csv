												Wipeout is a series I only recently discovered, but almost instantly fell head over heels in love with. Unfortunately, it's also a series that's been almost entirely confined to itself, with little in the way of similar games to be found on other platforms, and whose future looks incredibly bleak with the shutdown of its developer, Sony Liverpool. As such I've been clamoring to find something to fill this soon to be gap, and the unapologetic clone that is Flashout 2 seemed like a good stopgap while I waited for a more fleshed out experience. How very, very wrong I was to assume even that much.If you've (sadly) never gotten the chance to play Wipeout, it's a futuristic racing game set at an absurd speed as you careen through gravity defying courses, shooting off missiles and hitting speed boosts along the way to fend off competitors. Flashout 2 recreates this almost exactly, but what it loses is everything that makes Wipeout such an addictive, visceral game in the first place.First on the chopping block are the controls, which have the dubious honor of being among the most unnecessarily convoluted control schemes of any game I've ever played. Every pickup is tied to a different button (or direction on the analog stick), and these are explained through a horrendous button map screen and almost hilariously bad tutorial, which couldn't even be bothered to remove the ""tap the screen"" text from the original mobile version.Secondly, the racing itself is plagued by extreme repetition and a noticeable lack of any sense of speed. Each of the games ten tracks are almost entirely indistinguishable from each other, and are so plainly designed that I was already tired of them the first time around, let along the hundreds you'll be seeing them throughout the campaign. The different ships you can pilot all feel more or less identical, with the only difference being each is slightly faster than the last and takes more to blow up, but even when you're flying at seemingly impossible speeds it doesn't feel like you are. Flying through races in Flashout 2 is unbelievable dull and tame in what it attempts, which for a game that bills itself upon light-speed futuristic racing is a huge problem.Further to this point, the handling is especially odd, with a bizarre alignment problem that feels halfway between an overly controlling assist and another person trying to steer your vehicle at the same time. It's awkward and I have no explanations for why it is how it is, or what reason the developer could have for making it this way (assuming it's not simply another of the many bugs of the game). Online multiplayer is a joke, lacking any way to invite friends, and opting to use your PC's name instead of your Steam handle.Graphically there's a lot happening on screen, but none of it is particularly impressive. Textures are blurry and simple, and the color pallet virtually unchanged from every race in the game. Particle effects lack any power behind them, seeming more like excessive lens flare than explosions. If there is anything nice I can say about the game, it would be that the soundtrack is actually not half bad, and in another context I might actually enjoy listening to it.I had high hopes for Flashout 2, despite its always questionable mobile origins, but it failed on a fundamental level to deliver even a small dose of the excitement I get whenever I play the series that ""inspired"" it. Even taken by itself, there's nothing fun or impressive about anything Jujubee S.A. has done, and the more I dug into it the lazier they seemed, with an abundance of bugs and mobile-port carryovers that have no business in a PC version. At this point I guess it's time to make another sacrifice at Sony's altar and hope they bring Wipeout back, because this just isn't cutting it.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												IF YOU WANT WIPEOUT:- Try the Slipstream GX[slipstreamgx.com] alpha right now, and support them.- Look forward to Formula Fusion[www.r8games.com] from R8 Games, ex-wipeout devs.- Look forward to Redout[34bigthings.com] from 34BigThings.This is a mobile game, so the racing feels very artificial and casual. It's not Wipeout, and it's not trying to be Wipeout.From that standpoint, it is well made and I enjoyed what the game is actually about. The craft partially steers itself, and your job is to adjust your position on the track to pick up powerups and use them at the right time. It's not about getting the perfect raceline, it's about aggressive weapon usage and activating shields when they're really needed. Other reviews cite control issues, but I think they've been fixed. I had no trouble after I fiddled with the settings. The music is great. The voice acting is bad enough to be funny.			"

												Don't get this game! It reminded me alot of the old Wipeouts from PS1 and looked well presented ,and faithful to its obvious inspiration, on the store page. Alas it seems like a bad port from mobile platforms, atleast it is presented like it and plays just as bad. The gameplay is basically done for you, you can't even turn around on the damned track if you wanted to. It basically auto steer's and aims the same. I came wanting a game faithful to the old wipeouts, and the advertisements promised it, and were presented pretty well, but not at all reflected the actual gameplay. In all, plays like a bad mobile port, presented like one too (on a platform that shouldn't), is completely devoid of any challenge and gamplay that would have bought most people here, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥izes it's inspiration.

												In my humble opionion, this game is the worst racer I have ever played in my 20 years alive. The good: *Cricket noises* I mean the futureistic look is ok, and techno and dubstep music is cool, but you'd have MUCH better luck elsewere. The bad: Here is the controls, Move vehicle with arrow keys, and activate boost, weapons, and everything else bu clicking on it with the mouse in these horrifically located buttons all around the screen. Want to change control methods? You're outta luck buddy, that's all you get! And that's just the intro! After 8 minuites of my life wasted on this game, i asked for a refund. Seriously, It would do mediocre as a phone app, and even then I wouldn't buy it. The Ugly: THIS POOR EXCUSE FOR A GAME!!! Bottom line: 0/10 Don't even spend a cent on this game! I would uninstall it even if it was free! I don't always review a game, but when i do, it's beacuse it sucks!			"

												This is a mobile game, do not be fooled. The original controls are for tilting an iPad back and forth and it shows. The racing is very bad. There is no acceleration. The sound effects are stilted, the music is generic, the cutscenes are sub-par, the lighting is over-saturated.And it has a generic Unity Settings Launcher, which is just tacky.Is this a good replacement for Wipeout? No.Is this a good racing game? No.Does this make it a bad game overall? No, but definitely feels disingenuous to bring this to the PC platform.			"

												This game's got released too early and it's not ready yet. For a 300MB game it needs a lot of RAM, FPS drop a lot even though my PC is quite decent, achievements don't work at all (any progress you make by firing rockets,killing enemies is not tracked)Well, this game might have/ have had a potential but I think I lost 90 minutes of my life playing and trying to figure it out.

												Decent fun indie racing game. However I can't recommend this game because the game economy's is not balanced at all for a paid game. The prices seem to be inflated like there were supposed to be in app purchases but the pc version does not. Upgrading/buying a new car is mandatory to proceed but unless you want to grind forever don't bother. Also multiplayer is dead... I like the soundtrack tho			"

												3.0/10 - Think this looks like F-Zero? Think Again.This game had me excited from the moment I checked out the videos; I was extremely disappointed though. Nothing on this game how it should. The graphics hit the mark in a futuristic way, but lack any real brilliance or high quality. You use the shop to upgrade your car but most of the add-ons are quite overpriced. This means you are prevented from playing the season until you win a ton of tournaments. You won’t want to win that many.The actual racing portion was ultimately the deal breaker. This game reminds me of an endless runner more than a racing game. You only need to go forward and you can finish the race, there aren't any challenging obstacles other than the other competitors. It's extremely easy to die so get used to the wonky key bindings early so that you can have a fighting chance to win.Worth $0.50 or so; I would suggest passing on this offering though.

												This game is decent if you get it for Android but definitely not for PC.Bad features: annoying music(it becomes that after some time), no explanation of who the characters are, I guess this is one of the games that you just run and play, but if they show some characters in there they should at least explain about them, also as I see in the store page some characters appear in screenshots, but don't be wrong there is no explanation of who they are, and I didn't saw most of them also even playing the game, lack of basic things in options like language change, bugs(developers tend to fix them, but still there are), not good race system, little confusing menu, and dead multiplayer.Good things about the game, it has controller support, achievements, Steam Trading cards.

												At first, Flashout 2 seemed like a rather fun little racing game to play. It almost reminded me of a less complex variation of FzeroX for the N64. It was pretty fun for a few races. Then the glitches started pouring in. The basic AI functionality seems flawed to its core. Some races are unwinnable as AIs hit the improbability drive to appear at the finish line while others appear to forget that they left their parking breaks on at the race's start line. Normally I could find some of this forgivable, however once I made my way to the proverbial final boss level... Well the level just wouldn't load. I tried reloading it several times and changing every setting I could to no avail. This kind of coding error is unforgivable. Very disappointed and a bit suprised at how poorly this game was made for the PC.			"

												Have you ever played or at least heard of the games Wipeout, or F-Zero?  Well Flashout 2 is a lot like those games.  You race on a track and have weapons and stuff to shoot at other people.  Its fast pace and the weapons are generally decent.The controls are a little annoying, but it was a port from a mobiles and was just released so that will hopefully change.  Even if it doesn't the game is still very playable and fun.The AI is pretty good, but I'm sure going up against humans will be more fun.This is a fun game to either go though the campaign or just jump into and have a couple of quick races.I'd give this game a 7.5 out of 10.  There is room for improvement, but even if it just stayed like this is a great game.  Pick it up once you get a chance if you like racing games, I really don't think you will be disappointed in it.  Though just to make sure always check out some gameplay video for it on youtube.			"

												I was a heavy player of wipeout HD/Fury on PS3...Technically, the only thing ok for the game is the FPS which is sustain 60 fps.(come on guys, where is the 64bits native build!)The gameplay seems not finished, or is quite strange. Basically, you must not miss the speed pads, there is no real 0-gravity flying mechanics/physics to master, that's dangerous, because it would make the game quite uninteresting.I have a few rendering bugs on the radeon open source driver (radeonsi).The music is ok, the 60 fps is ok or course, but the GFX is poor, *really* poor. Wipeout HD/fury is rendered on a 10 years old GPU and it looks 100 times better and runs at 60 fps too, come on guys!Conclusion: there is still a ton of work to do to bring that game ""up to speed"". I'll check it on a regular time basis, meanwhile I cannot honestly recommend it. "

												I would like to say that I like the game. If you like arcady racers you will enjoy it. However, I have just bought flashout 2 so that a friend and I would have a game to play together. I am currently using an XBOX 360 controller to play the game. As I traverse the menu's they can be a bit clunky and sometimes it selects the wrong thing. I have no way of inviting my friend to join my match. We queued together several times and it was working great. Now, we select to join a match and we just sit for 50 seconds without our computers finding eachother. This is a real problem for me considering the reason I bought it was for the multiplayer aspect. I hope they are able to address the issue soon.			"

												If you go into this game with the hopes of it being the next WipEout, it's not. It is, however, a fun little Anti-gravity racer ported from mobile. I would only recommend this game if you buy it on one of the countless sales it has had when it only costs €1. Because while it is kinda fun to just turn off your brain and just enjoy some average, mediocre anti-gravity racing, it is just that; mediocre.Less than that if you don't figure out how to change the controls so they work for you... But once I did I found it compelling enough to play a couple of races, then close it, then someday revisit it, play for half an hour etc etc...Pros:-It is an Anti-gravity racer at it's core.-It is not difficult(yet) by any means. (Writing this having only finished the first set of races)-Mindless anti-grav fun.Cons:-It feels cheap(like a mobile game)-It is in it's entirety a very mediocre game.-Controls are not particularly great even if you rebind them (which was hell)To be honest, unless your looking for mindless mediocrity of a anit-grav racer, you are better off waiting for one (or all) of these games instead:RedOut (for Ps4/Xone as well!) - http://34bigthings.com/Formula Fusion (for Ps4 as well!) - http://www.r8games.com/SlipStream GX - http://www.slipstreamgx.com/ "

												**EDIT**: Just a quick note, there is a bug (not sure if it was only for me) with the achievements. When I won my first online race, I also unlocked the ""50 online races"" and the ""100 online races"" ones, and at some point during the game, I unlocked the ""complete 100% career"" thingy achievement, while I only did about 5%.--Good, bad, it'll depends. My first start was a little bit weird as you're kinda thrown away, and you've got to find your way around in the menu, but I was quickly invited to play the tutorials (in two parts). The first was fine, even though I didn't really know what I was doing, and I couldn't finish the second one, totally lost it at some point. I'm not really sure if the tutorial helps, but the game itself is, I guess, rather simple to play. You press W and you go at your maximum speed, which will be rather slow at the start (you better fly over the speedboost). The ship felt responsive, and I could feel the speed, but the camera is bad. You can't really see where you are going, and what's going on in front of you. I'd say the core of the gameplay is rather nice and fun. I tried some multiplayer, won the match, but I have no idea if I was playing against actual players, or bots, as the game uses your computer name's (yes, I was Marshall-PC!, it could at least ask for a name to enter, or use Steam's name). Felt pretty easy, but once again, bots or real players, who knows. Graphically speaking, I like the style of the game, the colors and some nice little effects, but you can't just say it has ""High-end visuals"" and is ""HD"". Well sure it is HD if you play in 720P, 1080P and maybe more, but the texture are bad, and isn't HD at all (if I'm not right, I maxed them out). Now about the music, well, I liked the music, well, the three songs I heard. I'm not sure if you unlock for as you play, but it felt repetitive, even tho it was nice overall. There's some cutscenes (not 3D or using game's engine, but a sort of comic style) with poor, really poor voice acting (and not all the lines at present). It is better than nothing. For a $10 game, can you ask for more? Well, I don't really think so. It's in overall a nice game for 10 bucks, and I hope for the players that there'll be players for the online for some time. I would recommend the game to have some fun, maybe with some friends! If I had to give a rating, I'd say 7/10. It's a $10 game, lack some details graphically and have a rather clunky menu when you first play (you get used to it very fast), but it's fun and responsive.			"

												If you're looking for a simple but enjoyable futuristic racing game this one fits the bill. Speaking of bills, I wouldn't pay full price for it but if you see it on sale it's worth a snag if you're a fan of this genre. The game could definitely use some track variety as everything ends up kind of looking the same, and the graphics and weapons aren't anything to be too wowed by, but the soundtrack is pretty awesome electronic tunes, and the gameplay is at least fluid and fast-paced. The soundtrack and speed of the game are what redeems it from being average.			"

												Bad graphics, bad sound, bad controls. This game tries so hard to be Wipeout but ends up being a crappy F-Zero rip-off. A really bad one at that. The car designs are horrible. Little kids in 5th grade art class could draw and color better looking hover cars than the ones in this game. The music isn't too bad but it's nothing special, mostly just dance songs. The cool dub-step song in the trailer isn't in the game. It can be entertaing to play a couple of races but after awhile it's just tedious. The difficulty level increases too much after the first few tournaments, even if you have a better car than the rest of the grid they will still out-pace you in the beginning of the race, and then you just have to slowly catch up.There are so many different neon colors going on in this game you're going to puke after playing for 30 minutes straight. For some reason the developers thought it would be cool if the track constatly changed colors. WTF??? Despite what the description says the graphics are not good in this game. They are like IOS games. From far-away, wow it's pretty good, and then close-up, it's complete crap. The only reason you wont notice the crap graphics most of the time is because the freakin' game has major bloom effect going on and it's all just a blurry mess. That isn't how you make a game look cool ffs! Even the backgrounds are complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ On the France level there is a 2D Eiffel tower. Really? it's freakin' 2014 and you have 2D images in your backgrounds??Oh yeah and the voice acting... WTF also. It's really bad and sounds like♥♥♥♥♥♥ One of the rival characters in the game is Duke Nukem for some reason, it's just stupid.And guess what? The weapons are just plain bad. You cannot tell if the 'guns' are actually hitting, most of the time they miss and then sometimes the enemy will explode in 2 seconds like you hit them with a death-ray. The 'rockets'(really smart rockets are dumbfire, missiles have guidance systems to lock-on, they can't even name the weapons right) require a lock-on mechanism to hit the target but it's a total piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ once again! It will lock and if you don't hit that button right away too bad it breaks lock and your 'rockets' go into a wall. And quite often if you get a lock the damn things wont even catch-up to a freakin' enemy. And if the enemy racer hits a jump while your 'rockets' are following they will disapear... WTF!Only buy this game if it's $0.99.I will give it 1/10 for creating a sense of speed at times and the music is decent. Everything else is just crap!			"

												Really enjoying this game! Not sure why there are so many mixed reviews - it seems like most folks on here are biased against racing games anyway, so I think that's why. The controller works just fine (there's an options menu off the main menu where you can choose input) and it's got a great soundtrack. Graphics are good enough - sure, it's a mobile port so the graphics *could* be better on your uber:pc but you know what this is a low budget racer and its not like you're paying full whack for it - the graphics are good enough and when you're whizzing down the tracks at a zillion mph you should probably be concentrating on the gameplay instead!!I got it on sale, so I'm super happy with my purchase but I don't think I'd be too disappointed at full price. It's a very playable fun little arcade game :)			"

												Steam needs a good 'anti-gravity racer' but this isn't it... This is a clunky/buggy Wipeout clone riddled with issues. The interface is unintuative and provides no information on how to change which vehicle you're going to pilot. The tutorial tells you what to do, but not how to do it... ie. buttons are not displayed on screen during the tutorial.  Also the ""Failed"" pop up screen during the tutorial doesn't accept gamepad input. There is no victory ceremony after having won a cup. The voice acting is on par with House of the Dead as some of the worst I've ever heard. The empty multiplayer lobbies do not allow you to invite Steam friends to race, leaving you to race A.I. bots in multiplayer. Even with all of it's shortcomings if they had only included local splitscreen multiplayer I would have been happy, but they didn't. It's very hard to recommend this game to anyone despite it's lack of competition on PC platform.			"

												The game is nice, it really reminds me of Killer loop on PS, but you can upgrade your ship here, Don't listen to others about controls, controls are good, of course at first every game seems hard to control, but after few levels you will be controling your ship to the victory :D			"

												It's kind of like a love child between the F-zero and WipeOut series. Lots of speed, racing, and battling on track, although a majority of the time you'll spend trying to swerve onto the boost panels to retain any sort of speed. Not a bad game for the price. Controller support is always nice.			"

												Pretty fun game, a bit of a mix of F-Zero and Rockin' Roll Racers, good to just chill out and play. After a while all of the races start to blur into one as everything becomes a bit repatative, the tracks and the soundtrack, but for $10 this game is 100% worth it.			"

												15 years ago there was a great SW pod racer game. Fo2 has the same feel in terms of speed and turning, but the graphical environments are not as ""cool"". I understand the criticisms of this game, but for less than serious gamers, Fo2 is quite entertaining. The 1st single race for the Redox trophy has some sort of code bug which causes the player to be trapped within ""infinite laps"", never going beyond lap 1. Of course I did about 50 laps, made 100,000 ducats, but quit the race, lost the money...I figured out how to get beyond the bug by winning the other 4 races for the tourney after quitting the 1st one. Red Swan is beatable; one just has to be perfect in terms of hitting all the speed boosts, laying mines in the right place, and collecting Nitro powerups. (You can figure out how to do that exactly without me spoiling it completely). Also, Fo2 is much better than the racer simulators found through Linux repositories; using WINE is a security risk, so we linux folks make the best of what games we can currently use for our platforms and flavors.  Finally, maps with long straightaways (London) are actually...soothing; there might be a market for driving simulators where the object is to just ""chill"".			"

												Works great in Linux Mint 17.1 Cinnamon. As someone who never buys AAA titles new if ever, I don't see any problems with this game. There is a settings menu at launch that allows you to change graphics and key mapping. Using a Gravis GamePad Pro works fairly well. I still have to use the mouse when I finish a race to go through menus, but I will admit I didn't bother trying to mess with the settings that much since it worked well enough for me. The axis keys wouldn't set, but they were automatically picked up by the game. The settings launcher before playing seems to make whatever is selected invisible (white highlight with white text), but this is a Steam issue and I haven't tried it on any other operating system.The game itself is interesting. Not what I would call easy. The crafts are like hovercraft, so it isn't precise steering like with tires. If you REALLY like racing games then you will probably like this. Especially with a controller. If you aren't a huge racing fan and no controller then it might not be for you. I picked this up on sale and really couldn't understand all the negative reviews. It isn't bad at all on my small HTPC setup and makes a nice addition to my SteamOS +Linux library.			"

												The game controls are responsive and work well , the graphics are pretty cool and the soundtrack is composed of techno which is surprisingly good however the game continues to crash after levels on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64 bit which causes me to lose any changes or progress that I had made since the begining of that particular session. Please fix this issue as it is a blemish on what has otherwise been a good game.			"

												I enjoyed Flashout 3D on my Ouya and this one is not disappointing. It is close to being a Wipeout or f-Zero clone but it's mobile roots do show through some times. Better controller support would help too. And for the love of Zeus please turn off the auto-accelerate so it feels like a true racing game.			"

												I highly recommend this game if it looks like fun to you. Sure it isn't as finely tuned or polished as a lot of games out there, but it doesn't need to be. It's a low resource, low cost game that's just plain fun, harkening back to the days of the early PS2. This isn't an immersive game, and it isn't a game that's going to hold your interest for 60 hours straight. It is however a fun, light-hearted, mildly competetive game that's going to keep you coming back for an hour at a time over and over for a very long time.			"

												I fancied this as a Wipeout clone, which it is, but without the playability. The power-up icons are unclear as to what does what, the tutorial is annoying (you have to use mouse to clear the boxes which pop-up despite using a controller to play), no idea which button is supposed to activate what. It's clearly intended for a touch UI, and so is obviously as a lazy half-arsed port. I've only given it a few minutes, maybe it gets better, but that's not something I feel the urge to find out. Still, it was cheap in the sale.			"

I love the way it accelerates and might slow down a bit more when hits the wall.I'm not really sure for what resolution that game was developed, because 1366x768 looks strange, very blurry.I might try another resolution. And I love the idea to have it as window, also nice idea.Beside of that idk why people say that stearing is not good, I think that most of the games forget how hard is to control a flying car like that with arrows on PC.... I love it. Keep up a good work :)			"

												Granted, at the time that I'm writing this I have very little gametime in, BUT based on what I've experienced so far, the game feels fresh, arcadey, & fun. Unlike most racing games I've seen on Steam that are rooted in modern day reality & are sims, this is fast paced & arcadey, & feels like I'm playing a game like F-Zero with weaponry that, for me, brings Mario Kart or Wpeout to mind. All this being said, if you wanna play a racing game but don't feel like playing a sim, you can't go wrong with this.			"
