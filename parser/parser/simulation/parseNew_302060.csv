												A game made by SCS Software back in 2011.Some of the tasks in the game are really easy but some of them are a lot harder which is a good thing, there's no free roam atleast I didn't find it if it was there but I don't mind at all, the game is about completing tasks in various scenerios and I think it does exactly that!If you've played Euro Truck Simulator (ETS 1) the truck's handling and the enviroment's might be familiar to you which might help/might not help, atleast I found a lot of familar places while playing this game.Overall, I recommend the game. At the moment it's 7,99€ (on sale) but the actual price is only 9,99€ which isn't that bad so if you like trucking simulator's you should atleast give this one a try! :)Also in the game, there's 50 Tasks + 7 Basic Trucking Tasks (learning the basic vehicle manoeuvres) and 6 Bonus Trucking Tasks and there's also ingame achievements (Note: Ingame not Steam achievements). A total of 36 achievements.There's also 13 different truck models to choose from and a bunch of color choices!EDIT: SCS Software added some achievements to this game some time ago and if you have completed some of the achievements when the game didn't have Steam achievements, you will automatically unlock them.Also, after fully completing the game, including the Bonus Tasks, I can just say that it's an extremely hard game to complete, especially the last few missions.

												This is a great game for any Euro Truck Simulator (ETS) fans.  While ETS focuses on endurance driving and the freedom of trucking, Trucks and Trailers (T&T) focuses on the technical side of things.  T&T is basically a collection of complicated trucking scenarios which are organized as mini-games.  It is very similar to Scania Truck Driving Simulator.  Challenges range from parking in small confines, navigating through tight corners, and mastering brake control.  The goal is to complete the task without causing damage to your vehicle.  This can be a lot of fun for truck enthusiasts, and there is little doubt that one’s trucking skills will improve.  DifficultySCS decided to award Gold, Silver, and Bronze medals based on completion time.  A good driver should have no problems achieving the Silver medal for most challenges, but the Gold times require slightly rushed maneuvers that should never be attempted in real life.  Achieving Gold often requires many attempts, even for the best drivers.  It adds a nice challenge, but in real life, parking isn’t supposed to be a rushed process.  Replay ValueDon’t expect much replay value on this game - unless you want to repeat the challenges over and over.  Despite this, the challenges will take you a fair amount of time (I am still working through them).  If you can get this on sale for less than 5.00 USD, it’s a fun little game to have.  A steering wheel or controller is recommended, but the default K&M controls are more than sufficient.GraphicsExpect this game’s graphics to be somewhere between ETS1 and ETS2.  It looks quite nice, and most low to medium spec PCs should have no problems running this.  You’ll probably get a higher FPS on this game compared to ETS2.For the features it has, and its price point, this is a great game.			"

												Any idiot can press the accelerator to go fast but that does not make them a good driver. Being able to maintain control while negotiating corners and avoiding obstacles is what takes skill. Doing that in reverse with  massive trailer on and still beating the clock is a real challenge.The game is basically Euro Truck but confined to warehouses and frieghtyards etc. There are a few obstacle courses on roads, but there is no highway cruising here. It all about parking trailers. The tasks start out simple enough but soon get pretty challenging. On Pro mode the constraints on accuracy get a little too tight on some challeneges causing some serious frustration, but ultimately all are doable. The different camera options and angles are a bit limited and sometimes it gets pretty hard to see what you are doing. Mouse look is available but awkward to use since you are on a time limit and usually dont have a third hand to be able to make use of it. Pro mode becomes even harder as you can only use driver views and the mouse, which means you will need to be an expert and using your mirrors.Overall this game is a great test of driving skill, coordination and situational awareness. A good buy for any true driving enthusiast.			"

												Trucks & Trailers aka Semi-Trailer Parking Simulator 2011Pros:1) Really challenging.2) Physics engine is decent. It's not great, but passable. Cons:1) No manual. I got a 404 Not Found Error. I have no idea how to manual reverse.2) No customizable avatar. Why even have a portrait? Missed opportunity for collectable headgear. Gold medals are meaningless. Where is my CAT ballcap?!3) All trucks are COE and seem to handle the same. Missed opportunity.Final Score: 6/10. I picked this up while it was -80% off for only $2.39 and even then I'd probably only recommend it for die hard semi-tractor simulator enthusiasts.			"

												To begin I got this on discount. Trucks and trailers is seemingly a parking simulator through and through. You drive your semi for about 10 seconds before having to park it in various places with completely unrealistic parking hazards to avoid. That being said the game controls relatively well for being a small simulator game and looks half decent except for all the people of this world being struck with play-doh fever and being struck with rigormortis at the same time. Anyway getting off topic. The game is centered around parking and how well you can do it. And with decent controls it's a good timewaster but certainly not a full fledged game. Even though it is well done I don't believe there to be enough variety in the gameplay to illicit the 7 dollar pricetag. But that being said if you can nab it up for a dollar feel free to do so and have a laugh with your friends about another dumb truck game that could've easily been released as a small iOs title for the app store. Overall gameplay wise it leaves alot to be desired but is fun for a short period of time. 6/10 Decent title. If you would like to see some gameplay here is a link.

												+ Challenging+ Realistic physics and handling+ You notice parking becomes easier after a while (it's also great for if you want to learn how to park in ETS2)+ Tens of challenges + earning medals = replayability+/- Graphics aren't too detailed, but they are realistic- Collision detection can be poor- Steep learning curve can scare people away- Camera sometimes gets in the way of the actionNote: don't expect an open world driving simulation here; each stage has its own little area.[Rating: 76/100]			"

												As an ACHIEVEMENTS freak, I think that this game needs a ""RESTART"" statistic and a cursing / swearing counter because the parking yards and the situations you find yourself are pretty hard even for an experienced driver.On the other hand (you have five fingers) is a great teacher for Euro Truck Simulator 2.

												I picked up this game on the 80% off sale, not expecting much, but I have to say that I'm impressed. Sure, there's no campaign, just a bunch of challenges, but it's fun, diverting and surprisingly engaging. It's also very satisfying; there were times I was absolutely sure I couldn't achieve what they were looking for, but with some lateral thinking, lots of shifting and a bit of ""crap, turned the wheel the wrong way"" I was able to complete the task and it's really rewarding. Definitely recommended.			"

												Whilst this game does not offer as much content as Euro Truck Simulator 2 or American Truck Simulator, it still gives hours of tricky driving and parking challenges, and has significantly improved my truck driving skills, very noticable when I play one of the 'big' games from SCS. With varying difficulty levels it is pretty much guaranteed to challenge even the most adept of truckers and will certainly provide many evenings of entertainment! Well worth the affordable price :)			"

												Well, it is tough choice between thumb up or down. I really like parking and precise maneuvering challenges, but timing for Gold is beyong ridiculous in most tasks. If you want to get Gold, you have to be reckless. No pro driver will drive in such a manner on public roads or parking lots. Time for Silver is more or less reasonable. This game can still be enjoyed if you aim at getting at least Silver. It is fairly easy to get Bronze because you need just to complete the task without crash to get it, regardless time. I give a thumb up to this game as a whole, but timing for challenges deserves thumb down.			"

												Great, if HARD, sim game. If you want a challenge getting trailers around into some difficult parking places, then this is the game for you! I picked this up as part of the ET2 deluxe bundle, and have been enjoying playing it.Pros- variety of tasks.- able to choose several parking jobs if you get stuck (not limited to doing in exact order).- basic difficulty setting allows crashes to simply 'finish' level if you want to progress and come back later.- real sense of accomplishment when you do it right :)- decent physics engine.Cons- getting gold in all tasks is almost impossible (I've yet to get silver in all). If you NEED 100% achievements, you might find this one too hard.- some parking restraints are insane in pro.- in game radio turns off between levels, so generally more trouble that it's worth.- reversing mirrors don't work like ET2 (just go on popup mirror)Rating 7/10This game definitely wouldn't suit everyone, as the difficulty of all the tasks might end up on the high side. As an experienced ET2 player I started on pro, then quickly dropped the difficulty. Some parking locations seem just unfair (WHY would you park a trailer there??), but then the challenge can be quite satisfying. So if you want a game to test your backing skills, and pull some insane speeds to go for gold (or even silver), then definitely consider this game! "

												1st impressions?Well. It has the potential to be so much more. Graphically it's meh.Steering controls took some time to set up for controllerThe truck sounds are pitifulPersonally, I'm glad I paid 49p for it, and nothing more.Ideally this game should be a DLC and be playable within ETS2. Then it would be pretty much ideal, as you'd have full, proper controller support, ALL the trucks in both left & right hand drive and having a training system in place before you start booling about in a virtual truck!Still very playable, and no doubt will be fun to play with, but I think it should be linked to ETS2 without a shadow of a doubt.

												I'm going to start by saying that I very strongly recommend this game for people who want practice on parking their trucks in Euro Truck Simulator. This game is quite literally a truck-parking game where you're to move your truck and park it without hitting anything within a short time. You get graded on each level given how fast you can park your truck successfully; Gold if you can do it perfectly and fast enough to make a TAS-bot look impressed, Silver if you're a very experienced truck driver, and Bronze if you managed to do it safely without hitting anything. The instant you hit an obstacle, you won't get a medal for completion, but you will still get a mark saying you completed the level.One thing that stands out to me in this game is the replay feature. The game will save a replay of your successful times so you can watch them later. I utilized this to make  this 1 minute video,  which I feel is good for demonstrating how the game plays.All in all, I would say that this game is for people who either want to better their truck parking skills, trailer-backing skills, want to play Euro Truck Simulator 2 without open roads, or a combination thereof. I personally enjoy it, as it focuses more on the technical aspects of parking your truck where Euro Truck Simulator focuses more on the long open-road driving.			"

Thats it.  Thats all the game is.  Just little bits and pieces cut up from the map and each piece is a different challenge.			"

												this game is nothing but a parking time trial, no actual trucking involved. the entire game is just parking your truck in increaingly harder parking spaces in as quicker time possible. nothing like Euro Truck Simulator.This wouldent be so bad, but the complete lack of a usable camera angle makes parking almost imposible somtimes, forcing you to use the birds eye view, wich inturn makes it increasingly difficult not to make contact with some small item that you dont see in the mirrors due to its small size and then hit because you see it so late you cant react, or at the very least makes you miss a gold by 5 seconds trying to get round it.

												SCS Garbage. This game was true SCS, back before ETS and ATS. The game has terrible controls, same graphics engine as their followup games (honestly? unfortunately so.) However, this game serves as an example how SCS has grown. From a ""Small company"" to a ""Small company with over 60 employees"". This is the best they could do back then, and they poured their hearts into it--and that is commendable, but somewhere along the line they decided to bring their current games' development to a crawl and charge as much money as they can on every little DLC from rims to paint jobs to a god damned trio of bobbleheads for your dashboard (ETS2). If you get this game for free as part of a bundle or something, consider donating to a child in Africa, as I'm sure they'd be more than happy with this pathetic excuse of a game. This review provoked by Timmy The Thief, a developer who is ""too lazy"" to go through complaints, so he just bans anybody who has something to say other than ""YOU ROCK SCS"". Boycott facist game developers and improve the gaming community for everyone.			"

												Trucks and trailers, ahh this game is genre defining.Pros-A cheap way to tell all your friends you are a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who has no friends-Cheap aneurisms and fun epileptic episodes- If you wish to experience the same ammount of pain as being curcumsised by a blunt rake covered in vinegar you can try and park a truck in this game Cons -Everything-Dont buy this unless you are a loser and wish to never see that day when you drunk abbusive father finally says he is proud of you.

												Very nice driving back truck sim, if you want to practice driving back its right here and for that price its a steal! Game sometime doesnt notice the impact on trailer or object and sometimes hit box may not be perfect but most of the time it offers a very realistic driving experience with decent challenges to get all 3 medals for a level. Better with a wheel as you wont be forced to go full turn like you would with WASAD.			"

												Since i use this game for 3 hours, i enjoyed it but for some reason, i got this game for only challenge and get gold medals. However, the challenges are EXTREMLY difficult and you need to be a pro for this.Pros:-Graphics that are same like ETS and ETS2 are amazing!-Very amazing places that isn't existing in ETS2 or is impossible to get it (via teleport actually.)Cons:-Extremly Impossible levels to get a gold medal.-Also there isn't many guides. (for gold medals) And really it makes me rage.Rate: 04/10 (i hated that i waste only 4.99 euros even is cheap.)			"

												Hard to rate a game I can't play because it instantly crashes & won't even try to open after installation. Pretty irritating since I have no problems running latest ETS 2. I was hoping for something that was the same, but different & instead I wasted $7.00.			"

												Coming from ETS2 it was a bit of an adjustment in terms of ""technology"". The controls are rather sensative and can glitch if you over do the programming, especially if your controller (Logitech F710 in my case) had D-Pads and Sticks with button functionality. Back to the game:Yeah, it's pretty challenging. But it really drives home what's needed to drive a big truck. It's not open road or anything. This is technical training. Parallel parking, reversing, you name it, you might need to learn it. If you want to just mash a button and drive. This game isn't for you. If you like a challenge. Go for it!			"

												This is another truck driving sim.   The execution is very good, as you're given a whole bunch of missions to test your skill in.Art is pretty good but not amazing - it's adequate, but developers should pay attention to improving the graphics quality.The game runs really well in 4K and it's quite smooth, you have a lot of customisation options which helps the game settle in with any gamer.

Product received for free
												If you like these types of games this one nails it. Definately worth $5. Just like the Euro Truck game. Stears correctly and really checks all the boxes for a fun little game. Lots of different views, but i wish you could have a free roam view, or better views. But that's just a little nuiance. Good game.			"

												This game is great and pretty dead on when it comes to backing up a big truck and manouvering it around. I have been doing it for over 30 years for real so i should know. If you dont want to do all the driving parts of the original game just the challenges this is it. Just a warning some challenges are pretty tough and fustrating even for me. But if you want a little  taste of what its like to drive a big truck this is a hint of what its like. Well if you do the in cab view all the time thats what its like any other view i would consider cheating lol			"
