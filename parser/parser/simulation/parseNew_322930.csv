												I really love this rc sim. Please be aware that it's more a training tool than a game. Right now there is a problem with the steam version that it only gives you 4 models instead of the 30 in the standard version. I'm sure this gets patched very soon. When it does you can make sure I will purchuse the professional or ultimate version.edit: The problem was fixed (very fast) and there are now 34 models to fly with. After flying with some other planes and heli's (I really suck at those) I'm really impressed with how every plane handels. All I need now is the ultimate version. A big thank you for the developer for responding and the patch.			"

												The feeling of flying RC helicopters in this game is great. I can't speak for the airplanes, but the helicopters feel, look and sounds great. I can almost feel the plastic/metalic joints and machinery swirling infront of me from the sound alone (it might sound silly, but for me it really helps with to remove the disconnected feeling from flying anything in a simulator vs the real thing). Graphics are decent, have not tried maxing the graphics though, but at medium it looks good enough, just wish i had a higher resolution screen :), the panoramas look great and are with enough detail and clarity that after a few minutes i stop thinking about it being just that, a panorama dome. The only thing i want to add to this is oculus support (if it's not already there, but i doubt there is). And one more thing, there is multiplayer have worked great for me, however, i wish you could play with the different training ""extras"" while in multiplayer. Take the limbo challenge for example, it would be awesome to compete with someone over who can finish it the quickest, we tried that but for some reason, only the host could see the limbo (or interact with it in any way). I am also still uncertain if you can really collide with another aircraft in the game... :P (Really not a big issue though for me, who just wants to practice flying rc helicopters to save some cash on crashes)			"

												Nice little gem here, definitely pick it up if you're into this kind of thing. Aerofly RC7 is a flight simulator of RC aircraft and can also be used as a training tool for those interested in the real hobby. Aircraft range from miniature indoor helicopters to full scale, fuel-guzzling beasts, every one is easy to fly yet tough to master! The sim includes beautiful photo-realistic scenery from real locations all over the world with many different airparks to fly from, which all have their differences, my favourite being the variation in runways (gradient, length, width etc). Every one makes for a challenging flight without even considering the wind yet!The hud is great and easy to interpret, it includes vital instruments in a simple easy to read format which can all be adjusted to your liking from the dropdown menus, everything works very smoothly and everything feels like how it should feel. From the menus you can also customize each aircraft to your liking e.g. throws and whatnot. I've found nothing annoying about this sim yet but If I do I'll be sure to come back and update this review.To sum it up;Pros:Great physicsAwesome interface Stunning photorealistic scenerySmooth running, high fps on ultra settingsEasy super simple control setup(Regular Joystick, Keyboard or RC transmitter of the simulator type)Plenty of great aircraft TrackIR compatible Very customizable (Aircraft flight surfaces, throws etc..)Cons:None other than the cost aspect, I got the regular edition yet moved to ultimate as I noticed a few of my favourite birds were in it. Ended up costing me well over $100 all up.I guess in the end if you really are into flight in general, flight simming or RC aircraft the enjoyment had is definitely worth it. Like all flight sims especially those with payware they are not cheap, I'd honestly say this one is worth every penny, and I personally love it!A must have for any AVGeek!			"

												Aerofly RC7 is an RC aircraft simulation game/training tool from simulation developer IPACS. In Aerofly you learn how to fly a wide variety of RC aircraft ranging from small quadcopters to giant military jets in a number of different locations mainly across the US and Germany. With a huge amount of customisation and realistic physics this is a must have for anyone interested in RC aircraft.While you read my review please take two things into consideration. Firstly, I played entirely with an Xbox 360 controller throughout my time with it. Secondly, I own the ultimate edition so some of the things I will talk about may not apply to the version of the game you're interested in.+Great flight models, they all look very realistic especially on ultra graphics settings+The physics are very realistic and from my little experience with real life RC aircraft the aricraft look like they behave as they should+Super simple interface that's easy to navigate and stays out of your way when you're flying+Lots of optional instruments and displays to make flying easier+Over 50 different locations to fly at most of which are photrealistic while others are fully rendered 3D locations which allow you to use different camera views+All locations have a number of different starting positions+Before takeoff you're free to move the aircraft around +Over 200 different aircraft which have a good variety of size and type of aircraft+Some cool 1:1 scale aircraft+For the most part it runs fantastically, I'm running it all just below max settings at around 120FPS+Lots of customisation options for aircraft including their size and mass+Can be played using KB&M, a controller, a flightstick or an actual RC controller all of which are easy to configure+Smooth controls, the aircraft all feel very responsive+You can play it splitscreen+/-Sound effects are hit and miss, some are excellent while others don't sound real at all-As has been said by other reviewers it's a bit too forgiving when it comes to stall recovery-You can't zoom in on the stationary camera (the only one available for most locations) so it can be very easy to lose site of your aircraft-The in-game smoke system available on some aircraft has a huge hit on performance, when the aircraft was close to the camera with smoke on I noticed a drop of up to 100 frames-Helis and gliders show very little to no visual damage when they crash apart from their rotors looking crushed or damagedVerdict:9If you have any interest in RC aircraft then this is a must buy piece of software with a wide variety of great looking models and great physics. Whether you're new to RC aircraft like myself or a veteran RC pilot you're gonna like this a lot.***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***El K.			"

												I am a beginner to the world of RC airplanes. I had one a few years back but things didnt go so great and became discouraged with the hobby until i saw this. I bought the standard version  (all a beginner really needs) and thought i would need hours and hours of practicing before I got good at it.. nope! I just needed an hour to learn how to not overfly my airplane, and smoothly control things to keep from crashing. Felt confident enough to go out with my new airplane today, and was more than happy to see that what i learned with this, helped in the real world... Highly reccomend to anyone looking to get into RC flying. I use a Logitech game pad (similar to PS2) and have a DX5e Radio that i am now waiting to get the hook up for so i can use it with this program.Graphics are excellent, models behave like they will IRL.  Overall a fantastic tool!11/12 UpdateJust an update - I was out flying over the weekend, and again yesterday. I have to admit that this as a TOOL (not game) is extremely useful and helpful to those getting into the hobby.  If you are thinking of getting into the world of RC flying, try this first - its a lot easier to spend 30 bucks on a piece of training software (a real steal if you think about it) instead of the hundreds of dollars on airplanes, radios and parts that you will need if you go out with out any practice or experience. I am not sure why there are people out there griping over the views  or cost.  The view is the only one you have (unless using FPV) when you are out at the field.. this isnt a shoorter, or flying game. This is a TRAINING TOOL!As with anything, start small- build from there. As a beginner you dont need the most expensive version. Learn to fly first, learn to transfer those skills to real world and then move up. If you go into this thinking you are getting a game, or that this is like FSX or anything, you will be mistaken.			"

												Well as you know there are 3 top RC simulators (RealFlight, Phoenix and Aerofly RC) in the market and this simulator is one of them. I have both RealFlight and Phoenix RC simulators and I just bought ultimate edition of Aerofly RC to compare with them.To be honest, It is very hard to compare all those 3 top rc simulators with each other, they are all good and they have all pros and cons. However,instead of comparing all those 3 games, I will try to explain my opinion about Aerofly RC.The Graphics are really good and it will probably satisfy rc sim fans.The Gameplay mechanics are really good and this simulator will really help you in real life if you are beginner. Especially, I have some of the in-game plane models in real life and game really gave me feeling that I am flying in real life. By the way, I am using Art-tech 6ch simulator transmitter which is cheap and easy to use on your computer. Sounds are good enough for you to feel realism and sucks you in the game.The aircraft details are fine and realisticThe weather is good. Especially if you fly your rc models at noon you can set up the time of the day and practice not to fly in to the sun.The wind is effective and normally in my city its rare to see weather without wind, so in the game I am using wind settings to be better rc pilot in real life.Summary:Best part; In my opinion, the hardest part of the rc plane is landing and this game will really help me to increase my skill about landingsI wish; there are some kind of missions which can add more playable options with friends, the game is a bit expansive and you really need to buy ultimate edition if you want more and you will want more... In some sceneries you can not change the views. There can be more planes, especially some electric motored planes are not enough for me because in real life I am just flying with electric motored rc planes.  In conclusion: this simulator is really great and it will give you both pleasure and training for RC models. I insist that you should use simulator controller (with cable if you can) instead of xbox or other type of controller. The other simulators are also great. However, this one is enough for you if you are searching for a really good simulator which will train you for real life or just enjoy multiplayer with friends.			"

												Excellent fun, excellent graphics. Very easy for beginners if you select 4D scenery + cockpit view, everything is easy to fly while you practise manouevres and landing (just the one 4D scenery area in standard package). WAY more difficult  flying from the ground, selecting Binocular mode from View menu helps by showing orientation of your plane. Only downside is so much more great stuff in expensive DLC. Although there is plenty of value for money in what you get here.			"

												Wish I could get a refund. I mistakenly assumed they would have improved their flight model from Pro, but all they did was add aircraft and sceneries. I cannot detect any improvement in stall/snap/spin realism at all. Pretty good for basic stuff, and hovering/torque rolls, but stall/snap performance is MUCH too forgiving, and not at all representative of any but the most forgiving models. Realflight is MUCH MUCH better.  I have been flying RC since 1978 and I'm an 8,000 hour professional pilot (full-scale) with competition acro experience (full-scale).			"

												This is a simulator for radio controlled airplanes, but I like to fly this sim just for fun. There is quite a steep learning curve to fly a RC plane while you are standing still on the ground, and this is simulated very well by aerofly. I like to try out the many different RC planes and helis. I even manage to land two or three of the planes :-)After playing around with the standard version I upgraded to the ultimate edition. Not only the learning curve is steep, but also the price.			"

												planes felt great, physics were pretty good, and my radio (Taranis) was very easy to set up in it.but, ultimately i got a refund for it - Professional version.theres a pretty good variety of planes, but they ended up feeling like the same plane duplicated, but with slightly different specs - dimensions, power, flight envelope. The sceneries looked good, but were mostly just panoramic images. The graphics were fine, some aspects were amazing, where others really showed a lack of polish.the best and most important part was the simulation felt accurate, better than Real Flight? probably the same if not slightly better. as insanely accurate as XPlane? no way.if Professional version was maybe $40 instead of the $100 i paid, it would maybe be worth it, but at $100 i would expect more polish and variety of craft.

												It goes to show your not ready for your maiden flight! Lucky for you, you bought RC 7! Yes it´s sweet and it just dose that to any beginner. I think it´s a good learning tool, and also alot of fun! Been siming some years now and this is fun, and also not easy. Your everyday sim cabin view will not help you here as your watching the palne from the outside, so it´s another concept of flying. It´s great for cordinating your incoming roll´s so you can get used to doing the opposite of what you want to do.Besides you don´t need a dedicade Tx to use RC 7, you can use a gamepad (F310) or XBox 360, your HOTAS, or a dedicated Tx.The only down side I see, is that the standard version has no aircraft editor capability, you have to move on to the pro version. If you do dicide to move to the Pro version and add the dedicated Tx connection, it dose get more expensive compared to it´s competitors. What I really don´t know, is if the versions are scalable. Other wise it´s a great affordable tool for beginners.Update from resent review...I don´t see very honest politics behind this dev, and to say a poor sence of marketing too. It´s a degraded edition of there full edition, the Pro Edition.  Which to some might be ok, not that I think it´s worth it, maybe even 10€ would be even.  Not only is it downgraded, there is NO mention in the manual, or web site of some of it´s limitations. No aircraft editor, no user frendly made content capibility´s, no weather condition control. To add to the cake, if you own this edition and want a full version, ADD 99€ more for the Pro Edition. Really? Get a full version from competitors for less, or try PicaSim Free for Android.  Support had me 4 days on hold to find out the above, so not much more I can say...Bad all over.			"

LOLFun, fun, fun, I love this game/Sim !!The fixed photo realistic scenes look fantastic.The 4D (3D created) scenery is a bit old looking, Flightsim 2004 look to it. The full scale aircraft models are not very interesting as I can fly similar with better detail  in my Flightsim X.The cockpits in the 3D planes are poor looking.  But I did not buy it to fly in a cockpit or through 3D scenery, I bought it to fly Radio controlled models around a fixed position and this game/Sim does that very well.			"

												Not bad for the price.  All in all, I recommend it.  I've had a lot of fun with it, and I've spent many hours of addictive play.  Later on, you may want to move up to a more realistic simulator, though.  I say buy the basic version and a decent RC simulator controller like the Volantex.  If you really like playing with an RC simulator, you can later spend more money on a more realistic one like AccuRC, Phoenix or RealFlight.  Heck, AccuRC even connects directly to Spektrum RC controllers at no extra cost.  If you already have a Spektrun RC controller, you might want to skip Aerofly and go directly to something like AccuRC.  Aerofly won't connect to your Spektrum RC controller unless you buy additional hardware interfaces.			"

												Its an okay game while using the xbox controller, but the price of admission is way too high. If you want a diffrent view, say from behind the rc plane you have to upgrade to the pro or ultimate im not sure which. Its dosent matter anyways because ill never pay $84 or $110 dollars for such  a small ""REWARD?"". Look at games like Skyrim, you get a crap load of contect for $60.00. With this game, $30.00 is a barely a 8th of the game. Who wamts to pay $110.00 for a videogame with few features, when games like SKYRIM exist at a fraction of the cost with so much content you feel you ripped off the developer. if you like rc planes and dont care about only one view and a handfull of planes/helicopters and gliders then go for it. But if you think a videogame should have all its features in a $60.00 format considering how few the features are,  Then pass. Let it go to the bargin steam bin from ill purchases.			"

												Helpful simulator for those of us where year-round RC flying isn't possible.  Am currently using my 360 controller, which is sub-optimal for a variety of reasons, most notably the inability to trim the aircraft as you would with a real RC plane. I realize that can be fixed, however, and hope to rig my DX-9 to the system in the near future.  Graphics on my system (Alienware Alpha with SSD replacement for hard drive) are exquisite, sound quality won't help with immersion factor, but is not a major problem.  Considering upgrade from professional to ultimate but am having enough fun keeping my thumbs in shape for the time being.			"

												its a little overpriced at $40 for the basic version (not much content), but if you like rc planes or want to learn, you may like it.it is pretty entertaining to boot up occasionallyif your running it on windows 10, press ""cancel"" on the compatibility window			"

												Helpful simulator for those of us where year-round RC flying isn't possible.  Am currently using my 360 controller, which is sub-optimal for a variety of reasons, most notably the inability to trim the aircraft as you would with a real RC plane. I realize that can be fixed, however, and hope to rig my DX-9 to the system in the near future.  Graphics on my system (Alienware Alpha with SSD replacement for hard drive) are exquisite, sound quality won't help with immersion factor, but is not a major problem.  Considering upgrade from professional to ultimate but am having enough fun keeping my thumbs in shape for the time being.			"
