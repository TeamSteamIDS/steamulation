												Nicole is one of those games that I have a hard time understanding exactly why I like it as much as I do. With tedious gameplay that is neither engaging or interesting and a predictable storyline riddled with clichés and unbelievable situations, you'd think I'd have played an hour or two and tossed it in the ""File and Forget"" bin of my library. On the contrary, I found myself plugging 15+ hours into the game, playing through all four character routes, and falling in love with each of the guys along the way (well, 3/4 of them anyway). Perhaps this review is my way of figuring out just what makes Nicole so appealing to me despite so many flaws.Our story begins with the title character arriving for her freshman year at college. She's a plucky, perky 18 year old girl who has spent most of those 18 years loving fashion, getting straight A's, and finding herself amongst the popular group of girls in high school. Oh, and she's never had a boyfriend or been kissed before. Not exactly the most realistic protagonist in the world, but she's likable enough despite being a tad annoying at times. After getting settled in, she stumbles across an article detailing the mysterious disappearance and reappearance of 3 female students who inexplicably have no memory of their time gone, but are so rattled by the experience they either drop out or transfer to another school. One would think campus kidnappings would have Nicole practicing a little caution, but it's not long before she's contacted by the kidnapper and warned that she'll be next. Logically, going straight to the authorities is out of the question; Nicole has no choice but to investigate the kidnapper herself. Yes...the story has some issues, but the mystery isn't what kept me playing.As mentioned previously, the plot is predictable and character routes cliché-fests.  BUT...I couldn't stop reading.  For an OELVN (Original English Language Visual Novel) the writing is exceptionally good.  Aside from a bit of annoying slang here and there, the characters are all well developed with their own distinct voices (something so many of these games lack), and the dialogue is fluid and for the most part believable.  On top of that, I may have caught maybe 2 typos throughout the 4 routes, and that's pretty dang impressive considering how so many games in the genre are littered with typos, misspellings and awkward phrasing.  So, despite my boredom with the overarching storyline, reading through the game was a pleasant experience.  And then there are the boys.  Yes, they're your stereotypical romance tropes, but they're written believably well.  If I had to boil it down to the one thing that kept me playing, it was the romance between Nicole and the guys. Watching the relationships go from acquaintance to friend, and ultimately on to something more, was enjoyable and interesting.  The gradualness of the friendships and Nicole's slow realization of her own feelings was refreshing. Much of the romantic dialogue and situations were hilarious, other parts touching, and some scenes downright steamy.  For an otoge, they hit a bulls-eye with the character romances.  Granted, the premise for getting Nicole and each guy in the same room for the relationship to flourish was kind of boring and predictable, but easily forgiven considering how much I enjoyed the result of those encounters.  On the visual side of things, the artwork is quite impressive for the genre and a highlight of the game. This artist has worked on previous Winter Wolves titles, and I'm a big fan of hers. The style has a soft feel to it which is accentuated by the pastel palette used to color the work; this complements the romantic tone of the story quite well. The character designs are not particularly detailed or inspired, but they're nicely conceived and pleasant on the eyes.  My only disappointment is that we don't get any CG's outside of the character endings.  But this is a small price to pay to have polished and professional looking artwork for the entire game.  Now, to detail the most boring, drudging, soul crushing aspect of Nicole, which is the simulation gameplay.  I generally do not find life sims to be very engaging, but Nicole's gameplay felt so much worse.  You spend a good 80% of the 4 game months picking the same activities over and over to level up your clues in order to further the mystery storyline while also leveling the requisite stat for the guy you're pursuing. And that's it.  You can literally go weeks without a single event scene triggering, and when all I want is to get to the next steamy romance bit, facing days upon days of nothing but the same monotonous activities again and again is torture.  We're not even given flavor text after each activity to spice things up either.  Unfortunately, by the time I realized how mind-numbing the gameplay was, I was already hooked on the feels that I forced myself through for that next romantic ""hit"".  Thankfully there's a skip button (hidden away in the options menu, by the way, but at least it's there) that helped me fly through things a bit faster on subsequent playthroughs, because I don't know if I'd have survived it otherwise.The rest of the gameplay consists of visual novel reading with a few dialogue choices tossed in to level up affection with the guys.  Honestly, the game would have been much better as a straight visual novel using dialogue trees to further the storyline, although it would have probably cut the play time down by at least half.  I wouldn't have minded this myself as I feel it would have made the experience MUCH more enjoyable, but I think it'd be hard to justify the $20 price tag for maybe 6 hours of gameplay.  In the end, I can only recommend Nicole to other female players who enjoy otome and a good romance now and again.  Unfortunately, there's just not enough meat to the story to pull the guys in, and I'm not sure most would be interested in the romance aspects which is the game's biggest strength. Still, for a game that was painful to play at times, there are much worse examples of the genre out there.  I'd suggest waiting for a good sale to pick it up.  At the right price it's worth it for the steamy bits alone.Bottom Line: 6/10			"

												I would say this is probably my second favorite dating sim from Winter Wolves at the moment (the top one being Roommates).  The game can get a bit grindy as well.  You have to raise certain stats to garner the interest of one of the love interests, balancing it with keeping your rest up, and increasing the clue stat to uncover the mystery.  It is a shame they didn't do more with the stats to affect the game.First, I liked Nicole; she isn't a perfect character, and I appreciate this is a girl who will try to get things done on her own (one problem I had with Always Remember Me is the character seemed to cry more than anything else).  Be warned this game is definitely darker  in tone than other Winter Wolves dating sims, especially if you decide to dig further into the mystery surrounding the missing girl.  Without trying to give away any spoilers, while it is darker, don't expect any R rated violence and blood.  The male love interests are a bit of a mixed bag, some definitely hitting stereotypes like jock and nerd, though the writing for them is still well done.As seems to be par for the course for Winter Wolves Games, some people may find the price a bit high.  Be aware Winter Wolves does hold several sales throughout the year, and this includes to their Steam games.One disappointment I have is that the GirlxGirl version still isn't ready yet, though it is definitely in the works.  Finally, if you are new to Winter Wolves games, I highly recommend trying the demo available on the developer's website.  This will get you used to the game, and give a good idea whether this is the game for you.			"

												I had high expectations for Nicole after reading the positive reviews on it. However, I was highly disappointed within the first 5 minutes of playing it. The writing is extremely cheesy, like a middle-school girl writing fanfiction. I did my best to overlook it and continued playing through 3 of the 4 character routes. It's very obvious in the beginning who the culprit is, and each character has a stereotypical personality. The only one I particularly liked throughout the progression was Ted and maybe Darren. It was very difficult to find Jeff or Kurt appealing. The story is brief and non-engaging, and I felt like there wasn't much to explore, even with the dialogue options. It was very linear and tedious, what with the last month having nothing to do but gather clues and randomly clicking activities just to get the days over with. It was such a pain to go through that since there were no more stories or events going on for that whole month. Even the ending was quick and unsatisfying. Another problem was that the characters all pretty much looked the same aside from Darren. And Nicole? She's really pretty but her personality just made me cringe half the time.Aside from that, I found myself enjoying it when I went through Darren's route and Ted's. I was just irritated that the story halted for that month as if they ran out of ideas. The game seemed very half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the after school ""activities"" were horribly boring.On a good note, I enjoyed the art, and the story wasn't too bad. The music was nice and set up a pleasant ambience, though I don't particulary pay any attention to that for more than a few seconds. All in all, Nicole is a very lacking game that is definitely not worth $20. I have quite a bit of regret spending that much on such a short game with little to do aside from clicking what stat you want to raise. Over. And over. And over.If it ever drops to at most 10 bucks, I'd recommend it then.			"

												I'm a big fan of the developers of this game, Winters wolves, so I had no doubts when buying Nicole. Undeniably it has great graphics, regular soundtrack, not caught my attention, but fits well to the climate of the game. The scenarios are beautiful, despite having few backgrounds ...I was wondering whether I should recommend this game or not, because it is extremely monotonous. You basically spend all the time choosing between tedious activities, which are summarized in you click, get some points and goes to the next day, while waiting an event appear. This system has appeared in some of them games like Heileen 3, but it was not something boring like in Nicole, because if you invested in one of the jobs, you earned one ending with it.Now about the characters ... My God, Nicole is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ She is too stupid, I could name several dialogues that I stopped and stared at the screen without understanding how she could be so stupid. And futile. It was to theoretically I identify with her? I dont see how anyone would identify with that dumb character.As the romance options ... I did not like Kurt, Ted was passable, but the pleasant surprises came with Jeff and Darren. Initially I had found Jeff boring, but his personality change gave a new breeze in this tedious game. Darren started very well for me, but then entered fully into the shy scholar boy stereotype, and lost what made him be interesting, ceasing to be a pleasant surprise. And I was investing my points for all romance with him, unfortunately.I thought I would have to investigate to discover the mystery, but its only you raising the Clue status over and over, choosing the options to ""Look for clues"", get some events and done. That was disappointing. I have not finished playing, and probably will not be able, I am striving to continue, but Nicole's personality keep me from liking minimally game.So it pains me to give a bad review for a game of Winters Wolves, but unfortunately I did not like Nicole (and I struggled to try). This is my opinion, and games of Winter wolves tend to be very good, so if you are interested in the game's premise (assuming the mystery part basically does not exist in the game), it may be that different from me, you like it, then try giving it a chance.

												Eventhough the game has it's charms, the game mechanics and timing ruin it. I, like many others who have played this game, have followed the games directions of:1.Romance the person to 100%  2. Get the character trait that corresponds with that romance up to 999  3.Get your clue bar to 999. However, even if you do all three, if you don't do them in a specific order at certain times you will not get the good endings. It is infuriating to put in so much work and get none of the rewards. If the developers would fix this I would reccommend playing it, but since it is a common problem with all of their games I will go ahead and say save your money and buy a well constructed dating sim.

												The story is incredibly shallow and so are the characters. Predictable stereotypes.There is no 'mystery', anyone can figure it out immediately after you meet all the characters.Solving the mysteries involves leveling up a 'clue' stat that unlocks cutscenes, and doesn't have any interactions related to solving the mystery yourself.The game is easy because it's predictable, but if you're not immediately sure who to date, it's punishing.All-rounding stats is simply not possible because of the sheer amount of points you need in a single stat.Overall, VERY disappointing. When I bought the game, the reviews were positive.It's at least a relief to see it sliding to Mixed, already.			"

												This VN was so bad, oh god. Not only you have to raise status (clues + status related to the character you wanna romance up to 999), but the story was bad and the characters were also bad. Like other Winter Wolves games, this one fails because it gives more importance to status raising than story and character development. Having a nice art style, BGs and decent BGM is for naught if the characters are empty shells and if the gameplay is annoying instead of being fun. This game was really boring in my opinion, and I don’t recommend this even for free. Also, after you raise the clues + status related to the character you wanna date up to 999, there’s NOTHING else to do on the VN. You simply gotta wait for the limit date to watch the ending. Argh.1/10.			"

												Main flaw about most Winterwolves games, is the stat building to get to the route you want, and the time schedule. Basically, you'd have to know which stats you need to get what route, and where to go on which day exactly, to get a scene with the person whose route you want in order to build up points with them. It's the same in 'Always Remember Me', and in 'Roommates' as well.For me this really draws away from the story, which is a shame because the stories in these games aren't half bad. I got almost all Winterwolves visual novels in several bundles once (Except the flower shop ones, which aren't any different apparently), and I know most of them are aimed towards a female audience, but that doesn't really matter to me if a story is good in a game, I enjoy it, such as 'Amnesia'. But this game, just like the others I've mentioned, is too focused on stat building, and it causes me to not be able to really get into it. The game becomes more of a chore. Now if you look at a game such as 'Gakao Love 100 days', that one does it right when it comes down to managing stats. It doesn't draw away from the immersion. Naturally, you CAN get a bad ending, and if you wanted to get to every route you'd have to most likely resort to guides, but point is, in all the other non WinterWolves novels I've played, in those even a bad ending doesn't leave you empty handed and unsatisfied.. A bad ending in those, is still a route. But it's not, in WinterWolves games. it leaves you with a sense of not having achieved anything at all, and just having wasted a whole lot of time. Also, I can play those other games, without a guide, going with personal choices, that appeal the most to me (That's always how I do a first playthrough of visual novels) and see where that gets me. It's the most fun, but I feel that in a game such as this one, I really can't. I can't go meet up with a character by choice, whose route I want to play, I have to run into them by going to the right place, at the right time.. That's just.. Not cool. If you're into visual novels that you have to play with basically a guide to get anywhere, then I'd say this game isn't too bad, but I personally find it a flaw that really doesn't make this worth playing. I quit almost all of their games halfway through due to this. The only one that I can truly recommend from WinterWolves is: Loren, the Amazon Princess. That one's pretty awesome. I really think WinterWolves isn't bad at the stories they present in their games, I just wish they executed it differently.			"

												This is a fun and breezy otome game. In it, you play as Nicole, a college freshman, who is investigating the abductions of three girls at her university. The goal is to collect clues throughout the semester in order to solve the mystery by winter break. Since this is an otome game, you also need to build up your relationship with one of four guy characters. Without giving too much away, the romanceable characters are essentially: -Kurt - a flirty jock on the football team-Ted - an obsessive workaholic -Darren - a painfully shy classmate-Jeff - an intelligent upper classman My only complaint is that even if you collect enough clues by the end of the semester, the bad end seems to trigger if you don't have a relationship with one of the guys. I would have liked to have seen an alternate ending where, if you gather enough clues, Nicole effectively handles the mystery by herself without needing to also be in a relationship.All in all, this was a fun otome game that I would recommend to fans of the genre. Also, if you're going to play this one, I would recommend romancing Jeff first.			"

												As a person not from USA I find it impossible to relate to the characters. - Too much and not enough personality is given to the main protagonist. On one hand she's very much your typical valley girl (talks laudly, likes clothing blogs, is not interested in studying), which makes sure that you can't project any of your own traits onto her, but on the other hand by being a typical stereotype she is very bland. - all of your date choices feel very one sided. The jock guy is all about sports with no smarts, the smart guy is all about evil (and nonsence as he is into alchemy of all things), the country guy is very country and the shy guy is shy. There are some details that you can learn about them that make them sort of human, but there's just not enough variety. Really as a dating sim it's not that bad. There's your stat grind, there's boys to chase, but... I just really can't stand it, because I can't relate to any of the characters at all!			"

												The writing is *painful*. The primary appeal of this genre is in the writing and development of different plot threads. I understand that college is an awkward experience for many people, especially women, who have to deal with misogyny, sexual violence, and any number of other threats. But nothing is *this* awkward.I look forward to the developer trying again.			"

												+ Art is very nice, especially the sprite art+ Music is pretty atmospheric and pleasant+ Well written. The choice setup has nice variations. I wound up saving beforehand to see each choice's reaction. Ted is my favorite for having his accent reflected in his dialogue.+ The in-game tips were very helpful. I had no difficulties in figuring out the stats system and getting all the endings.+ Each of the characters had different outfits for different scenes. This small attention to detail was a plus for me.+ Characters have believable flaws. The romance felt really natural. Nicole's personality worked dynamically well for each guy. The three pair scenes were really fun as well. Otome games usually don't include 3P scenes unless it's a love triangle, so it was refreshing. Only one route was kind of questionable.+ The pacing of character scenes is good. They are well padded throughout the game. They give a good amount of time to catch up on stats without having to save and reload if you are efficient.- The mystery endings all led to the same conclusion, so they ended up being a little repetitive.- UI is a little wonky when taking screenshots and seeing the sprites bleed out of the game window. I would have liked a proper CG gallery with the full uncut CGs.Being the same developer, I was wary going into the game, but left feeling impressed. Nicole was much more enjoyable and pleasant to play through than Always Remember Me.I think getting this during one of Winter Wolves' 50% off sales would be best.			"

												Do. Not. Buy. This. Game.I paid 20 dollars for this game expecting a fun dating sim where you controlled a girl who could date one of 4 guys, solve a mystery, and even possibly end up dating the wrong guy and be in for an interesting plot twist. I got none of that. Every cent I spent on this game was money wasted. Not a cent of fun was found.What I got was annoying task-managing, boring as heck characters with choices, and even the kidnapper is obvious. There's no mystery to it, he's only the kidnapper to add shock value and intrigue to his character. The endings are all pretty much drivel. You even at one point end up having a romantic route with the kidnapper, who by early on you should have ditched, making it a romance in the league of that of Twilight and 50 Shades of Grey, to say creepy and shallow.The other characters are bland, and even the ""bad"" endings aren't even bad, just disappointing. You're wondering what horrible things might happen to Nicole if she dates the kidnapper or is kidnapped, but in reality, there's nothing much to it.All this game consists of are clicking and doing tasks, and occassionally making text choices to get the right guy. And here's the thing, if you don't reaaaally work on getting the stats he likes /and/ say ALL the right things to him, you don't get the guy. It's literally an entire semester's worth of busy-work and clicking.FINAL VERDICT; 1/10. Worst 20 bucks I ever spent in my life. You're better off playing freaking Sakura Clicker, at least that garbage at least gives you half naked women to gawk at while you do stupid fetchquests forever.			"

												If only I could've given this a neutral rating, then it would've been better.At the beginning, I did enjoy the game though that could be a result of my favorite kinds of characters being in it, but it all went downhill after that. Well... Let's just start with pros and cons.Pros:-Good art for the price-Music is suitable for the changes in mood-The stereotypes actually worked out rather well for the charactersCons:-The story felt incredibly rushed. Especially in Jeff's route. Not only that, but I feel like things were just thrown in to fix inconsistencies in the storyline-Finding out who the killer is was way too easy. It made it feel like there was no point in collecting clues in the first place.If you like playing a game more heavily leaning towards the dating sim side than the mystery side, then yes, this game would be good for you. Otherwise, I'd can't really say that I'd recommend it. I find the story to be equally important for dating sims or for visual novels, so I was a bit disappointed.Storyline: 4.5/10Art: 8/10Music: 8/10Play the game when it's on sale is pretty much all I have to say. Would I play it again? Probably not, but I still recommend this game with a thumbs up for the art and music.			"

Pros:The characters and romances are well written and likable (though stereotypical)*Plenty of scenes to break up the monotony of stat-raisingThe slow progression from acquaintances to friends to lovers feels naturalThe normal endings are just as satisfying as the special endings, and if you get your stats up enough, you can unlock both without needing to play through it againGood graphicsNice music that goes with the different moodsCons:Some of the character’s personalities can be grating (Ted especially)*It’s pretty obvious near the beginning of the game who the “bad guy” is, but he’s still likable*I don’t mind stereotypical in an otome as long as they are well written, which they are.

												Nicole is an otome visual novel with a mystery element released by Winter Wolves and made by the same team that created Always Remember Me.Nicole has just secured a place at her first-choice university when she discovers that there have been a string of mysterious disappearances. Three girls have gone missing in the past year, and Nicole could be next.The mystery is well done and quite scary. Won't go too much into it but it’s well done.Male characters while well written are typical stereotypes. Kurt the Jock, Darren the introverted Nerd, Ted the hard♥♥♥♥♥ and Jeff the 2 faced ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Nicole Graves the main character while interesting also is a severe moron at times.The other characters are just as well rounded and actually they all have pleasant surprises with them. Gameplay though becomes a bit of a chore, honestly the problem is Diligence which there are the fewest activities to do, you won’t really start building it till the market opens.There are different activities throughout the game that increase skills and clue meters by an factor based on your morale and energy. Such as in the image above, However as I stated Diligence is by far the hardest to increase. As while most skills have area’s that increase between small and large, diligence only has small increases. While yes this makes becoming diligent more accurate, this impedes actual gameplay.This should be balanced out slightly more.The sound track of the game though is amazing.Now overal this game is a slow build for the male endings, but by day 35 it picks up and gets going really well. Once it starts you get really drawn in and the first 35 are not much longer than the rest of the game, but it feels like it should have written a little faster.			"

												(Please read review before taking the thumb's up at face value.)I wasn't sure about getting this game at first because of all the negative reviews, but I got it when it was on sale and I was pleasently surprised how much I enjoyed it. Though I can see why there would be quite a few thumbs down on this game, especially at it's full price.Pros:   - The art and backgrounds are nicely done, and appealing to look at through the whole game.      (The Chibis of the characters are freakin' adorable!!!)   - Nicole herself is not a blank slate character. She has some personality, which seems to be a rarity in otome protagonists.   - Buying your guy gifts.... <3 (Though you might want to save the game if you don't want accidently give a $100 gift to the wrong guy.... like me.)   - I LIKED EVERY GUY!!! I can't stress this enough. Usually in otomes you have a favorite guy, but with this one it's hard for me to pick one! Jeff had his ' rough ' moments but, every guy had their sweet moments with Nicole that I loved.  Darren was THE SWEETEST!!!!! <3Cons:   - One of the biggest drawbacks the game suffers from is it's execution of it's premise. While the premise of Nicole has the opportunity to make a compelling story for the protagonist, it just ends up falling flat. And by the end if you choose to ' solve ' the mystery, it just makes Nicole look kinda dumb by running headfirst into danger without a second thought. The mystery ending feels like it was just put in there to have Nicole be the damsel in distress. Also, why did she not keep the texts as evidence, or tell literally anyone she could be the next to disappear?!? Okay fine , go get that guy yourself- but bring a weapon or mace or something!-_-	   - While the stat raising wasn't a problem for me, it can start to really feel like grinding. Especially if you want to see both endings, which causes you to raise two stats all the way to full.   - Nicole does have a personality, but sometimes she can seem pushy and a bit unlikable at times.   - There aren't many CG's. The only ones you get are in the endings, and the only way to access them in the menu once you're done is to play the ending over.   - That Price. While I did enjoy this game, I'm sure my mood would sour if by the end of the game I realized I paid $20 for the stuff in the game that really irritated me. I got it on sale for around $12, and that was the main reason I bought it in the first place.So in conclusion would I recomend this game,.... yes, on sale.I got this game for around $12, and the amount of stuff I liked seemed to balance out with what I paid. There are some things in this game that just irritated me. The mystery aspects didn't really play that much into what I truly enjoyed about this game. The best part of this game really is the guys, which, to me at least, were all well done. So, go get this game on sale if you're looking for another otome game.			"

												If you're into otome/dating games, like a bit of fluff, and don't want to think too hard, this is the game for you. It's not a perfect game, but it's fun and charming if you're willing to enjoy it without over analyzing it.The mechanics can be a little challenging at first, only because it doesn't clearly explain that in order to get the best 'true' endings, you have to really balance the order in which you max your stats by a certain time frame, and not before, or the game won't give you the 'true' ending, much to my chagrin. There's a lot of walk-throughs and guides out there for the game, but most of them fail to mention that first you work your guy's correlating stat, but not to maximum, then spam the clues stat to full, then complete your guy's stat, all before November. It's pretty simple to do on 'easy' and seriously, there's no negatives to changing the setting to easy, seriously, it'll save you a lot of headaches if you do, in case the random stat generator isn't kind to you and you put in all that work just to get the bad or normal endings.Other than that, it's a pretty cute game. It's nothing groundbreaking, but I found it very addicting, I played through all the characters and endings in a few days. Once you get the hang of the stat system, it's easy to grind and enjoy the cut-scenes (even though it is, yes, a little grindy). The artwork is pretty and the story and character development is vastly superior to other games by the same developer.If you can get this game on sale or discount, I wouldn't hesitate to pick it up. Just make a lot of saves, have a walk-through open to help you if you don't want to waste your time making 'wrong' choices, and enjoy the ride.			"

												Nicole is a game which first draws you in with it's beautiful art and then gives you the task of unraveling the main mystery of the game. Of course like most VN it does have some of the stereotypical character personalities and plot devices but that didn't take away from my overall enjoyment of the story. I do wish the game was a bit longer and that the characters could of been fleshed out a bit more since it feels like a waste to have a pretty solid story and not use it to the fullest since so much more could of been added to extend the length in a meaningful way.My only real complaint is that when you get towards end of the game after you max out the stats you need there's nothing else for you to really do so it can get a bit boring until you reach the last day and see the final part of the story.Overall I enjoyed the time that I played Nicole and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good VN that has great art and music and doesn't mind that story has a few issues but nothing that should make you not want to play.

												I have only played a handful of visual novel games (new to the genre), but I know that in the goods ones, I look forward to the scenes between things like stat-building. In this game, I cringed and wanted to quit every time a scene occurred, which seemed to happen about every game day. Like the other game I played by this developer (Heileen), the writing just sucks. The plot, the characters...it's all done very poorly. An annoyingly loud (seemingly no matter the volume setting) bird sound effect in outside areas forced me to mute the game. Some of the cute art is the only thing this game has going for it. I managed to get (I believe) over halfway through and couldn't finish it due to the ridiculous, immature writing in scenes that seemed to drag on forever. To make it worse, you still had to go through all of the scenes with characters you aren't evening going for in that route -- you don't get locked out even if you keep choosing bad answers. I strongly recommend Magical Diary and Dandelion over this, which are both available on Steam. I have a few other games made by the developer of Nicole, but I am now hesitant to try any of them (except for the card drops) because of how crappy the writing in Nicole and Heileen is. What is a visual novel without good writing and characters, anyway? A waste of time.			"

												I've finished the game for all normal, special, and other endings - takes about 15 hours.  Overall, I really enjoyed this game.  I thought the writing was great.  Nicole seemed like your modern day college student.  Her wit was memorable, and I'm pleased that she had faults as well, giving her a more well-rounded personality.The mystery was not particularly difficult to figure out, but seeing how each romance dealt with it was entertaining.  There were some creepy moments throughout the game - nothing scary, but it was still well done.I suppose if I had to change something about the game, it would be less repitition.  Your entire semester is identical for each path, so you start to skip the dialogues and scenes.  Short of zeroing in on one of the boys' paths, there was no deviation.  I felt like that may have been the intention at one point during development (Nicole breaks the fourth wall and tells you who one of the characters are - but you already know this because you've been forced to play those scenes already).I also would have preferred more choices.  It's a massive grind to get your clues and primary stat up, and I think more dialogue choices would have helped with that.  Overall though, I really liked playing it and would recommend it to others interested in visual novels.			"

												Alright, I finally got around to fully completing Nicole (otome version).  Although I’m sure many have already pointed out the pros and cons of this game I feel like I should also point out how I feel about this game. Before I begin I want to let you know two things. I played this game on ‘hard’, so some factors affecting my critiques may differ to others who have played the game on other difficulty modes. Any “examples” I use in my explanation are not actually in the game itself, they are merely a way to show what I am talking about.Pros+This game meets the basic requirements of what it’s set up to be which is a mystery, dating, choice simulator and visual novel.+The music and sound effects all add to the atmosphere of the game.+The game has a basic system of ‘skill building’ and time management.+The characters all have basic differing personalities.+The backgrounds are very well drawn and colored.+The chibi characters are adorable. (However the guy’s chibi characters are only ever seen when you want to give gifts)Cons- (This one’s more of a personal preference) While having characters have different outfits is nice, there is no correlation to when a character wears a particular outfit. For example Nicole can wear the exact same outfit for consecutive events happening in the same week one day after another and no character happens to comments that she’s been wearing the same exact thing for more than once. (I’d like to point out that there is no option available for the player to choose what Nicole wears at any point in the game).-Some of the character’s clothing doesn’t look as polished as others and some of the guy’s outfits are basically the same thing except for a change in the coloring.- (Personal preference alert) some of the guys clothing doesn’t quite fit their personality in my opinion.-The text window often increases in size to accommodate for more text which can become slightly distracting.-When images are transitioning or fading out it often is either abrupt or results in a fuzzy pixelated look which degrades the art style and distracts the eye until the frames refocus.-After going through route after route the dialogue tends to get very repetitive.-There is a big lack of CG’s (meaning images that tend to show a particular interaction between characters and scenery or characters and other characters, often these images/drawings tend to be of very high quality and are used to emphasis something or show emotion) within this game and it disappoints me since there are a lot of scenes in which CG’s could’ve been used to really express what was being described.-The game lacks explanation or introduction to uses tools such as the manual skip button “Ctrl” or the somewhat ‘automatic’ skip button “Tab” to fast forward ‘seen text’ instead of just spamming the left mouse button.-After the first route the system of skill building can become somewhat robotic and tiresome from its lack of any ‘special events’ tailored specifically for each route. Everything follows a basic pattern, for example: on day ‘X’ event ‘Z’ will occur regardless of the route you are pursuing; This in itself is fine however it would be nice if there were occasionally ‘random events’ that occurred to prevent the droning and mashing of my left mouse button during ‘skill building’ while I slowly counting down the remaining days until a said event will occur.-Many of the ending scenes contain chunks of the same dialogue regardless of the route the player chose.-Sometimes there is no music or background noise for such a long time that it breaks the player’s immersion in the game.-There is no possible way to ‘win’ the game without fully romancing one of the characters.-Sometime the dialogue will mention information regarding the scenery; however the background shown will not match that description.-Some of the dialogue is poorly written often seeming ‘unsophisticated’ for a novel (meaning that it lacked purposeful word choice, detailed explanation/description, etc). I also noticed a few grammatical errors.-After solving the mystery once and playing again the game mostly follows the same exact process and ends with basically the exact same result regardless of the route. Meaning that basically once you have uncovered the mystery there remains very little content in the game that you don’t already know.-I often had to redo routes because the game tends to be picky about the ‘date’ that your skills have to be maxed out by in order for you to get a ‘good’ ending. So even though I maxed out the required skills days before the ‘deadline’ the game wouldn’t register it. (This led to me to have to redo many past weeks for some of the routes which was slightly annoying and repetitive to say the least).- The character sprites do not always reflect what the text is saying. Example: “Guy Character looks at me (the guy character sprite’s face looks neutral). But when our eyes meet he frowns… (the guy character’s face remains neutral)”. Beyond that often times the text will talk about a character being out of breath, or an action that they are preforming and that character’s sprite does nothing but stand still on the screen(this is where CG’s or more sprite drawings could be added to show the movement described within the text).-No choices made negatively impacted a character’s relationship. (At least as far as I could tell)-The game is kind of pricey for the content within this game.Neutral=This game contains no voiced characters=Some character’s fall into typical stereotypes, for example: The flirtatious jock.=There are no hidden ‘Easter Eggs’ (at least as far as I could tell)=The structure or anatomy of some of the character’s bodies isn’t quite ‘right’ looking, however those features do not stick out so badly that it negatively impacts the immersion.=I would’ve liked it if there were choices available to choose that would help to shape Nicole as a character, because often times it seemed like the game gave us choices that would possibly shape who Nichole was but then later it would become apparent that she was still the exact same character/personality regardless of the choices you made.The VerdictOverall, I believe that this game has potential, but ultimately it falls short of my expectations. I give it a score of 6 out of 10. The game was fun at first but become repetitive fast. The ‘reward’ players get for their relentless efforts of button mashing, in my opinion, don’t outweigh the time and effort spent to receive that reward. The characters seem to bond slowly at first and then before you know it they are best buds and possible romantic partners with little to no build of emotional attachment between Nicole and the characters to explain why. The story itself is simple enough, but for a mystery visual novel it falls flat after ‘winning’ the game since most if not all of the suspense and mystery are gone now that the player has already solved the mystery once. Honestly I ended up skipping most of the dialogue when I replayed the game because I had already seen it; this made the game seem kind of shallow for a lack of diversity in routes or dialogue options when replaying the game. However, the game itself can be enjoyable at times (especially some of the character’s dialogue). I highly suggest that if you are deciding or considering buying this game that you buy it on sale and understand this game has its faults.			"

												I really liked the sense of humor this game had. I also found most of the characters, especially Nicole herself, relatable and likeable. I also think the relationships were handled really well, building a decent foundation for friendship that leads to infatuation rather then suffering the love at first sight trope. My only warning is that this game is a slow burn. Seeing as how the main mystery doesn't start unfolding itself till you have a fair amount of clues it takes a while for the plot to really get going. The last month before you see the conclusion to your romance choice is also a little awkward because there is a chance you really won't talk to your crush for weeks, which feels a little disjointed. Either way if you like silly light hearted fluff with pretty boys and darker undertones I'd definitely recomend giving Nicole a try c:			"

Your relationship meter, clue and associated stat all have to be fully capped to get any ending whatsoever, and that's only if you did everything early enough.The art was good, and the characters actually had personality.I regret paying even the sale price, though.

												This is an interesting game. As a Winter Wolves product, I knew it would be great, as they don't seem to have any real stinkers. This game is the otome version (they appear to be working on a version with romanceable girls; though I'm not sure if the protagonist will also change genders). You are embroiled in a mystery, as a number of abductions are occurring on campus, and Nicole (you) decide to try and become Nancy Drew and track down the perpertrator.While you are gathering these clues, you bump into four eligible men who... entice your interest. Through a series of resource management actions, you can win the heart of one of them, solve the mystery, or both. Note the Very Bad ending is when you solve the mystery... yet don't win the heart of any of the eligible men. Also, one of those you are wooing just might be the perp you hunt...			"

												Not gonna lie, I was bored at first and with all the parts without the mystery or the boys. However, once I met them and started interacting I found the game started to get fun. The game is basically an interactive with a soundtrack and no voice actors, but I believe that's common for a dating sims. Alright, the good points; The boys are all fun and not just one-sided, the art and music are beautiful. Nicole's not bad to play and she's even fun at parts.And here's the bad; the mystery isn't too engaging after the beginning and Nicole is a bloomin' IDIOT in how she deals with it. The replay can be boring when trying to romance the boys and if you'll probably spend your time doing some random clicking if you fill your needed stats early.This is by no means a bad game, it's fun for what it is and very cute. While I wouldn't recommend paying 20 dollars for it, I do say give it a try. Again, the boys (the main reason we're here) are absolutely adorable and worth getting to know.In other words, I recommend.			"

TL;DR: If you're up for a simulation game with a bit of romance and mystery, give it a try. This is definitely the best Winter Wolves offering I've played.---Overall Impression: It's meant to be a mystery-romance story, and while those elements are there, I wouldn't pick it up for that experience. The romance elements seem heavier than many of the Winter Wolves games I've picked up, but you don't really get a lot of ""mystery"" at all. There are certainly some thriller elements, but the character's exploration of the mystery of the title is done entirely in simulation. Like most Winter Wolves games, the simulation part of the title is the majority of the gameplay and can really quite interfere with the story flow. That said, I did enjoy the title, but I want people to know what they're actually getting when they buy this one.Content: Overall, if you're okay with the premise of ""girl in danger"", you ought be okay. Honestly, I think if you can watch a PG-13 movie, you're more than qualified to handle the story's content.Translation: N/A - as far as I know, English is their first language.Editing: There were no errors in the text itself that I noticed. (I did notice two elsewhere, but I really doubt many would notice either.)Art: Overall, quite lovely. The style is super cute. My only issue is really that there were very few CGs and they didn't really match the sprites - often being dressed in something entirely different. (Also, the background for one area did not at all match what the text said.) I love that the sprites had multiple outfits - it really helped a lot. I just wish that there were a few more expressions since sometimes the expression didn't quite match the text.Character Design: I loved Nicole's sprites. Her outfits were always great. Overall, the designs for the love interests were pretty good too. (Didn't always match their personalities, but...)Story: I hate that the simulation overtook the story. I hate that the kidnapper was who I knee-jerk thought it was the moment I talked to them. I hate that they never outright stated why Nicole was a target of the kidnapper, given the reasons for the other kidnappings. I hate that the endings more than 60%, word-for-word the same as every other ending and you can't even skip through the bits that are the same.I hate these things because otherwise, I really enjoyed it. It really bothers me that gathering the 999 clues necessary to ""win"" does literally nothing (as far as I can tell) except trigger the difference between the good or bad ending. Nicole spends all semester gathering Clues and only is able to find anything out at the end of the game. It's a disconnect that probably wouldn't bother most people, but certainly makes me think ""Ludonarrative dissonance"". It would have been better to me if a certain number of Clues gathered triggered different scenes where she gathered information, so it really felt as if all that work she'd done reading old news articles, observing people, and talking to people amounted to anything. The Heroine: Certainly a woman of her own! I didn't like her much at the beginning of the story, but she grew on me. She is, however, an extrovert who doesn't ""get"" introverts in the slightest, so if you're a fellow introvert, her ""playful"" bullying of the introverts might annoy you. In closing...: As with many of my otome reviews, I seem to have more complaints than compliments. Please don't take that as a suggestion not to read/play the game, though! Nicole has a lot to offer to those where the concerns I brought up aren't deal breakers. Hoping Winter Wolves continues to improve.			"

												Enjoyable but ridiculous.I really enjoyed playing this game, but it is not without it's flaws. The game is your standard dating sim. Your protagonist is an attractive, somewhat ditzy youngwoman at college. You meet 4 cute boys. You raise the stateof the skill that most appeals to the boy you want to date. You say the right things and give the right gifts, and a relationship begins. Also one of them is totally an evil abductor. The mystery was way less mysterious than it could have been. I guessed the culprit the moment I met him,before I knew anything about him besides what his major was. For a while I entertained the idea he was a red herring, or that the culprit changes depending on your choices.Nope, it's always the same guy, though to the game's credit, things play out differently depending on which boy you cosy up to.Of course the mystery is entirely optional. If you don't investigate it, nothing happens. You just date a guy. (Who might be an evil abductor).I did find it frustrating that Nicole stubornly decides to tell NO ONE (including the police) about events she REALLY should have.  The game has what I've come to see as standard for games of this type, an utter lack of compatibility with ANY of the romance options. You're capable of getting a happy ending with any of these utterly differnt guys, despite there always being some quite serious personality flaws (on both sides), that do not mesh well.One poor romance option is painfully shy and introverted. How does our lovely protagonist handle this? By dragging him kicking and screamign out of his comfort zone, then being confused when he gets upset. Also the stats, aside from morale and energy, are only useful for one specific guy. Upping any stat will increase the rate at which you find clues, and how much money you make at the assocciated job. But there really is no reason to develop unrelated stats. Which means if Nicole isnt' dating the relevant guy, she will never bother doing her homework or taking extra classes. All in all I loved the game, but I fully admit parts of it make very little sense.			"

												Overall I found this game charming. I didn't think the stat gain/drain was too unbalanced (though I did notice morale plummeted 2x as fast as energy when on my Jeff playthrough) and the men started out as typical cliches (the jock, the nerd, shy guy, and country bumpkin) and then they were expanded upon. There were a few typos but they were easily overlooked because of ho far apart and few there was. My biggest complaint would have to be that sometimes the memes slipped in were eyerollers. Like, there's a pop culture reference/meme reference slipped in just about every other text block. Like, chill out you ""Rollr"" nerds. I do want to say kudos though, as this is the first otome I have played where I actually liked the protagonist. I thought she was cute, if a little illogical at times. The music in the game was not bad but I found if you muted the music volume then try to put it back up you'd think it was on mute. But it doesn't seem to play the music again until there is another actual cue for the music in the Ren'Py script (my guess at least).I am definitely going to buy the ladies segment when it comes out. Though considering there are maybe only 3 noteworthy females other than the room mate (Bethany only being mentioned in Jeff's route) I am not quite sure on how the devs will do that. Unless there are like 20 females hiding in the Ted or Darren route, I have not done either of those yet.Also, the fct that during triggered scenes with one character you could have another boy there and raise both stats at once was a nice addition that made it feel more realistic. The boys didn't live in worlds completely independent of one another.			"

												This isn't a terrible game, but it's certainly tedious and boring, with few fully-drawn cut scenes. Two of the characters (Ted and Darren) are interesting and likeable, but the other two are a misogynistic creep and a disney villain. Much of the gameplay is spent clicking on activities (several for each day) to randomly raise stat points, and the ""investigating the mystery"" portion is simply raising a ""clues"" stat to 900 before the game ends. Very dissapointing, especially for the ridiculously high price.			"

												I actually flipped a coin about whether to reccomend this game or not. On one hand, the characters are almost all interesting (I could have done without Kurt, as there's more than enough sexual harrassment going on in real life for me to tolerate it in my games). On the other hand, the story line is fairly boring. Partially this is because, despite the tags and the teaser, Nicole is NOT (I repeat NOT) a mystery game. In fact, the game basically tells you who the culprit is in week two (I spent the rest of the game on my first playthrough hoping desperately that was a red herring... to no avail). So, Nicoe is 90% dating sim and 10% mystery which, okay, would've been fine if it weren't for the part where even the 90% dating sim relied on completing activities and waiting for stuff to happen. You get about 8 actual cut scenes throughout the game and the rest of the game is mindlessly clicking buttons until you can generate one of those cut scenes. Worse, the autoskip feature becomes next to useless as you have to stop to mindlessly click activity buttons for ""dawn, day, afternoon, dusk, and night.' Despite the game play mechanics being annoyingly boring and the overarching mystery being, well, silly (I could go on and on and on about exactly how silly but this would involve spoilers), I found myself enjoying the interactions with Darren, Jeff, and Ted enough that I don't feel as if I wasted the money per se. I'd still recommend, if you're interested, grabbing the game when it's on sale. (For the record, tails -- don't recommend -- won the coin toss.)			"

												This game is literal trash.Don't spend $20 on a slow paced, badly written game.The ""mystery"" is easily figured out within 20 minutes of gameplay but for some reasonI spent 6 hours STRAIGHT playing this crap. I has playability sure ..  But I hated every second of it.Main character is an unlovable ♥♥♥♥♥ and the characters you're supposed to romance are allautistic spastics.In particular Jeff.This ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥The game tells you ""Don't worry about clues just get you other stats up""I had 966 clues on december 20th.I got the ♥♥♥♥♥iest ending.I could have spent that $20 on a pack of cigs and it would be more enjoyable than this game was.Slowly killing myself with tobacco is more enjoyable than this game.

												I actually really liked this game.  The art is pretty cute and I don't really mind that it is a points based game (like Tokimeki, you have to build stats).There were a few things that I wish were different.   First I would have liked more gallery pics.  You only get 2 per guy.   Second, I wish the storyline diverged sooner than it does.  The entire game spans three and a half months and I feel that you repeat the entire first month and a half for each guy.  Additionally, until the ending scene the final half month is also the same.  That said you really only get a solid three weeks or so of independent story for the guy you chose.    Third, the dialogue is a little cheesy.All-in-all even with the the downsides I enjoyed the game, and since I bought it when it was 50% off the price was right.  I recommend buying it when there is a sale - it will help compensate for some of the repetitiveness :) "

												I enjoyed the story, despite some of it's irritating endings. It is well written, and the characters are interesting and well developed.I did not, however, enjoy the strategical aspect of the game.If one raises their stats in the wrong order, they end up with a ""bad"" ending instead of the good ending. If you actively research the order the stats should be raised in, and keep it in mind while you are playing, it's not so bad. If it had been, perhaps, based off of certain responses to questions instead of the order of the mindless stat grind, it would have been passable.Otherwise, I recommend this game for the story. Do look up a guide to help you achieve the best endings, they're worth seeing.			"

												I recommend this game if you are a fan of otome games. I enjoyed the mystery aspect added to the romance.Pros- Mystery gears the game as well as romance- A good balance of difficulity (I play on normal and am able to achieve the special endings with a bit of wiggle room)- I find that 3 out of the 4 guys are attempting to break stereotypes in these games (The Jock is the exception)Cons- The actual romance can seem dull and some points (I have only finished Ted and Jeffs routes though)- I find some of the music to be annoying but only for certain places like the gym and clubI would recommend this game but only to friends of Otome or Dating Sim games. Yes the mystery is there but you really just look for clues, no puzzels to complete. Hints? To those who are having trouble getting the special endings focus mostly on clues until you unlock the jobs. Also taking a nap takes 2 turns but if you take one with only 1 turn left in the game you still get Morale and Energy up the same amount.			"

												I am a little mixed about this game but like it enough to give a positive recommendation. I give it a recommendation because I like the art and 2 characters and there is something likable in a “home grown” visual novel which targets an English speaking audience (leaning toward American as they are in Florida)The art is really made me buy this game. I think it's geared more to a English speaking audience but doesn't cross into the line of silly cartoon style of the West. Also the character designs are cute and the clothes are defiantly something that you would see an American college student wear rather than a Japanese/Korean. I think this makes the characters more likable because I felt like I was back in my own college days and these could be my own friends, where as characters targeted at a Japanese/Korean market always make me feel a little alienated, even though I did study in Japan for half a semester.   The writing isn't bad, but has an overly simple plot. I'm really not huge on raising sims, I just want to read the story, so my view would probably more skewed toward the quality of the story. I felt quite a bit let down after solving the “big mystery” of the game, there is much potential for a much more in depth story. There is a bit of surprise on one path that I did enjoy, but I don't want to spoil the game in a review.However after playing so many VN/Otome games made from the Japanese market, it felt really refreshing to play a game that was actually targeting English speakers. Culture references, ways of speaking, quirks that make characters more interesting (accents, etc), characters that were designed to target English speakers all make this game more unique.  Also stereotypical characters can even be interesting when you feel like there are so many rehashed characters in the Japanese market (more seen in mobile games). The game play isn't bad, but I'm not huge on stat raising games. It took me  a bit of time to find the best way to raise the stats but after that it got a tad bit boring. I like games that at least try to add a bit of dialogue for every time a stat is raised, makes it feel a bit more exciting than just simply dry game play of stat raising games.TLDR- Buy this game if you are looking for something different than the standard otome game			"

												I was really unsure if I should buy the game, since there were so many bad reviews about it, but in the end, my inner fangirl won out, and I bought it. And I didn't regret it. I really like it, but there are a few points, that might be the reason why it's not for everyone.First, it's a stat-raising dating Game - so the story is told in a few cutscenes - and the rest of the game, you choose what you do in your free time so that you can raise your stats or search for clue-points (which you need if you want the real ending of the game)or  work to earn money and buy your sweety a present. I really liked the Characters (Jeff) - that's the most important aspect of a game for me - so, even though I don't like stat-raising Otomes, I still liked the game. Altough the time between the cutscenes, was sometimes a bit tedious. Especially at the Ending (when I already had maxed everything I'd need for my Ending out) it was really boring. Still, that's not new with stat-raising Sims.But what really came short, for me, was the mystery aspect. All the relevant scenes came at the ending at of game, and I didn't feel like my collected clue-points mattered at all. I just knew, that I had to max them out to get the real Ending. And the mystery - well, I just might have watched to many crime shows, but it just wasn't enough for me. Not scary - not suspensful enough. But I really liked the rest of the game. I liked Nicole - in most routes - and I really liked Jeff (me, the fangirl), and the dialouge was funny/witty (most of the time). And I absolutely love the art. I'm not sure I can recommend the game to everybody, but I had fun with it.			"

(I bought it for $5 and wow was I impressed) And I have yet to unlock the other endings but that's only because I love Ted so much. :D			"

												Nicole is a kinetic novel dating simulation game. You play as Nicole and you're the next victim in the strange abductions in her school.Likes-Art-Script writing-Likeable guys-UIDislikes-There little dialogue in the game. The simulation part eats too much time. If I take away the simulation, one route would probably be at least 10 minutes.-No Steam Cloud. Saves are important for a kinetic novel, most especially for a tedious dating sim game. Unfortunately, your saves wont be synced. I had to manually sync using Google drive.-Finish 1 route and you'll know  whos the criminal right away. So the replayability value drops and the mystery is gone.-Can't skip the simulation after finishing 1 route. They should add a skip simulation, like a new game+ mode.It could have been a really great game, almost everything was there except more story content or a plot twist perhaps. I definitely enjoyed the art and the boys, but heh, the story really lacked impact.Update: On April 5 2015Cloud saves are finally enabled! So I'm changing my rating as well.Thank you Winterwolves for listening to customers.I hope the next otome game would be an improvement to Nicole.			"

												The story wasn't quite what I expected from the description, and I had almost hoped for a little more hands on when it came to solving the mystery, but do I regret my 6 hours I spent on a single playthrough? Not in the least! I really look forward to going back and trying for the other 9 endings. Nice story. My only complaint would be how slow and tedious it can be to increase the stats in anything other than 'easy' setting. With a cap at over 900, you don't have much option other than picking one guy/one stat and doing nothing but build it and the clues stat up. Rating? 8.5/10			"

												First of all, Nicole was an overall good experience. I wouldn't call it the best vn I've ever played but it was good enough to play through all of the endings from the romanceable characters (I've postponed playing the bad ending for the time being but I will... sometime). While I must say that I was enjoying the characters, the story itself and the art, the vn was lacking serious depth. I mean the case was actually quite good but I've felt that I - the player - could have gotten more out of playing and reading the story, whereas the romance parts where quite good. They weren't great but really cute.The character profiles were quite profound. Jeff, for example, was the most intriguing one. I've begun with his path and thought the others would pale in comparison. I was mistaken. The romanceable scenes were always nicely written as I've already mentioned. The only thing that was really bugging me, is the gameplay. The idea itself seems to be good but unpolished. You can choose a variety of actions every day but you could almost go on choosing the same option over and over and - to be completely honest here - it's gotten on my nerves. That was the only thing that would keep me from playing. IF there would have been an option like skipping that part completely or make it shorter, this would have been nice. It's just a little sad that it doesn't really matter where you ""level up"" your skills. I would spend my days in-game just clicking the same option over and over again until I've reached the special ending. All in all, I suggest it to everyone who wants to play a nice romance/mystery - VN but doesn't care too much for the latter genre.			"

												A fun game if you don't mind some stat building along with your storylines.  I liked the art and generally liked the characters and text.  The main character was better than many.  I agree with the review that said this is a solid addition to any otome collection.  It gets a little repetitive while trying to get all the endings, but the different scenes for each storyline are worth it and you can save partway through so that you don't have to necessarily go back to Day 1 every time.One important comment... I did get some glitches with the game endings.  As somebody else said, you have to be a bit careful about getting the stats and relationships to the right levels at the right times (which I gather may be a platform issue, but I'm not sure).  That happened to me and was frustrating, but I did get it work so that my subsequent playthroughs were no problem.  I'm surprised there weren't more comments on that problem in the Steam discussion forum for the game.Overall, I'd say content was good, art was good; a solid 8/10 for me (I had fun playing).  Music was generally appropriate and added to the game.			"
