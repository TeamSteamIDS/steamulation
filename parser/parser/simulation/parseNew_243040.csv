												One of my favorite games growing up Startopia still holds most of it's value even with how dated it is. It does scale to 1920x1080 (and possibly above) without having to do anything to the game which itself is a huge plus for an older game. Some of the menus/UI choices are clunky (but again, it's a very old game) but nothing terrible to use and the game does offer a fairly detailed tutorial through the campaign. If you like a good, old-fashioned, economy focused game - this is for you. While there are some forms of combat in-game (you can change settings to limit/expand this) it's mostly just focused on building a working, profitable space station.For $6.99 - you can't go wrong here.

												its older but still addicting once you figure out how to play it. your on a space station with 3 floors. floor 1 you build power, hospitals, cargo holds and ports(for people to enter and leave the station) among other things. floor 2 is the entertainment and hotels floor and floor 3 is a biodeck where you grow plants to harvest for different materials.in this game you also hire(or fire) many different species of aliens. each species specializes in their own types of jobs. remember to give them all promotions every so often or they will quit.theres still a couple mod sites around and the game is very easy to mod. to me this game is a must have. be warned that time zips by when having fun specially with this game. hours will go by in seconds			"

												This game is the funniest game I've ever played, bar none. The developer, Mucky Foot, had really outdone themselves in creating a wonderful game which will keep you busy for days on end trying to outwit your opponents, keep your workers and visitors happy, and keep trash to a bare minimum as you take control of a derelict space station. I'm overjoyed it's now available on Steam, even if the original creators have long since gone their separate ways. Here's to you, you wonderful people, who gave me and the rest of the world a game which I've played with glee for years since obtaining my original copy, and can now hopefully continue to play through Steam for years more to come.

												A classic to this very day, in my mighty yet humble opinion. Staropia offers something akin to a space station tycoon sim mixed with resource management and a healthy dose of humor. Cure diseases, perform hostile takeovers of station segments, and rehabilitate hardened criminals - all for a profit. Somewhat dated visuals aside, it's a very solid game with a good bit of mission-based play through the chapters as you learn to run a station, and a nice sandbox mode for testing your skills once you learn the ropes. So go on, give it a try... The Mighty Cthulhu commands it!!!			"

Short ReviewDespite how the graphics will look they are just fine.You will end up spending most of your time at a view that the ol school graphics will not be a bother.A great deal of simulation mechanics involved that all work well with one another making for a fun and challenging game. The A.I. has a various range of difficulty and can become your best friend or worst enemy.Loads of content in the game you will not feel short handed.The game has both singe player and mp hosted via peer to peer.Skirmish mode gives you a  variation of options,from playing solo no A.I. opponents,to having A.I. opponents,to having win conditions.There is a tutorial but you can skip it and just start the campaign because it progresses as a tutorial.Each mission you work for a different race and learn about how that race acts.The campaign is a lot of fun and I suggest playing it.There websites that provide custom campaign missions.If you like sim games,city building,strategy,trading,warring, check this game out.[Regular Review]This game has quite a lot going for it.You have 10 different races in the game that serve as customers,clients, and employees. They come with their own likes and dislikes and even have abilities separate from one another.Each race works a specific job in the game so remember this will be crucial if you want to have a fully functioning station. There are also worker droids which serve as maintenance and security patrol and are always needed. Outside of the 10 races and two types of droids there will be events that pop up in which can effect the outcome of how well or not you are doing.Solar flares,meteor strikes,plagues,etc a good host of  events can occur. The events come in flavors that are helpful and harmful and add spice to the challenge of the game.There are three floors for every section of the space station. Floor 1 is the lowest and acts as the industrial section.Here you build your port.These allow passengers to board your controlled area of the station.Other items such as factories,sickbay,cargo holds,labs,recycle center,prison,security control center,etc are built here. Floor 2is the commercial services section.Motels,Hotels,Inns,stores,bars,etc get built here and will be where the build of your money unless you decide to focus on trade.Floor 3 is the bio dome which acts as you would expect.You can grow vegetation here which once mature enough can be harvested and the products traded for energy or used to create items  or supply your commercial shops and services.The Currency in the game is energy.You produce energy by building energy collectors(like a power plant),power boosters,medic bays,sleeping champers,stores,hotels,etc. When patrons go to shops,hotels and such they pay you in energy while at the same time the facilities use energy in order to run so be aware of any facility that is costing you more power to run than it is making. Luckily thanks to the detail in the game, you can power down the facilites if you desire or even deconstruct the whole thing and sell or store the building units used to build it.Expanding your control of different sections of the station can work in two ways,you buy the sections with energy or you hack the enemy control neighboring section.Combat occurs of someone (you or the A.I.) is under/starting attack.Once you have your security staff and just about anyone else that can help to defend/attack they will head immediately to the way point you set.If an enemy is in your ranks and attacks someone in range of a employee capable of attacking,that employee will attack.Outside of the security staff & drones you can build turrents which are quite useful but require energy to fire and function so be careful using them.Mechanic wise is where I love the game the most.Everything has needs in order for you to gain access to them or use them properly.To get trade you need a com and a port otherwise no ship can dock in.In order to have some commercial services running you need the races that work in them.To get those races to come after time has passed you need to make sure their most wanted items are on your station or that the conditions they prefer exist. These are just examples but its how the whole game works.Everything gets used,has a need,serves a purpose.If you choose to specialize in  different economic areas they come with their own negative/positive aspect keeping everything balanced and challenging.There is a campaign in the game that plays with you being hired by each race that is in the game to build the type of station they like to visit.In total there are 10 campaign missions 1 for each race.Their difficulty increases sometime throwing you tol the wolves.From my experience each mission was harder than the last.This serves to teach you how different portions of the game work as well as teach you about the race you are working for and what they like/dislike.Since you will need to know this about the races each mission gives you more of an edge as you carry over what you learned but still throws new things at you.I really could go on in even more detail about this game but I believe I covered enough to give you a good idea of how this game is. I am a big city builder fan and sim fan in general and this game by far has impressed me in more ways than I thought possible considering how packed with content,balance, and developer love/care it has. I never knew about this game back when it first came out, and I am glad I did not because in this current stagnation of good city builders, this space station builder came out of no where to help quench that thirst. Get the game if you never played it before, or did but looking for something to play. As old as it is this game keeps me wanting more. I wish for a sequel be it official or spiritual its just that much fun.There is even more I could say,but this should suffice.			"

												I picked this up primarily out of nostalgia. It's a game I've long enjoyed, despite the fact that I never quite grasped all of its mechanics when it was entirely new. It's very much like a sci-fi Dungeon Keeper - you're tasked with managing a space station, building facilities to squeeze money out of visitors and meet your employees' needs, extracting resources from plants, and going to war with rival groups for complete control of the station.Most of these gameplay elements are fairly simple and intuitive, and it's quite relaxing to watch the various aliens go about their daily lives aboard your station. That said, its simplicity is also one of the game's downfalls - combat is about as simple as pointing out a target and watching all your combat-capable employees rush to attack it without much thought to tactics, and strategic considerations in this game consist of nothing more than ensuring you have more warm bodies on your side than your opponent.Likewise, the management aspects are rather simple - it's not altogether difficult to figure out what you need to build and keep everything in the green, though there are some missions that do provide a satisfactory challenge, albeit one that doesn't really hold up on subsequent playthroughs. One thing I noticed was that population and demand for facilities don't always increase proportionally with supply - just a tiny handful of higher level entertainment buildings and hotels can very easily meet your station's entire demand, so expanding past a certain point becomes worthless, as most residents and visitors will only congregate at a few points, giving your station the feeling of an empty ghost town as opposed to a bustling community.Though a second look did reveal some flaws I hadn't noticed the first time around, I would still heartily recommend this game to anyone who might be interested in the general concept, as the game still holds up amazingly well, especially for such a low price.

												Man, i wish i had known about this game when it came out. What a gem. Created by a bunch of ex-Bullfrog employees this is an amazing little management game. You are tasked with looking after certain sections of a space station. You start the game with 3 Bulkheads. One Industrial, one entertainment and one recreational. You have to look after the visitors of your small part of the space station, making sure they are happy, hiring some of them, to work on your part of the station, while meeting increasing demands.The game is made up in the good old 'tutorial style' where you have a fun mission and each mission it introduces new things. Like for example, in one mission it unlocks the priests and you get the mission to create a pilgrim station, giving you ample opportunity to learn how to use the priests properly, while being a fun and challenging mission on its own.Eventually you'll end up fighting NPCs over control of the station. Fighting them with weapons and economics (depending on the level), or simply sneak attacking them with a security droid, sizing control of the section.But its not all roses. The game was released in 2001 and it age shows, not only in the Artwork. The UI and its like are barebones, in the same style as it was common back in 2001... its lacking some tooltips and the interface is a little needlessly complicated. The background sounds aren't the best, but its a 14 year old game.It reminds me a lot of the original Themepark game, except Startopia has Aliens, Lasers and Spacemonsters.			"

												Somehow we made it through the 90s and 00s without a truly classic space station simulator. You would think Deep Space 9 fans or Babylon 5 loyalists would have pulled something together, but really all we have is StarTopia. Despite the novel premise I never really got into this one as a kid, it being more Dungeon Keeper than I had hoped. Revisiting it now I see where it deserves a lot more attention than it got, and also why it was so overlooked.StarTopia sets you up as the administrator of a classic donut-shaped space station. The first thing that may throw you off about your position is that you're not actually building the station, just filling the interior. Each station is sliced into a dozen sections with three decks each, a service deck, a leisure deck, and a bio deck. You construct buildings within these cavernous spaces that provide all sorts of services to your visitors and residents. These are anything from space motels and bathrooms to research labs and penitentiaries. Most structures can only be built on a specific deck, and in fact you can't build anything on the bio deck, just adjust the landscape for growing different plants.The result is a game that plays much more like Dungeon Keeper in space than a proper space station builder. Each visitor to your station is simulated, and you can watch them walk around, spend money, and see what they like and dislike about your digs. They also have stats that apply to their job if you hire them, as many of the buildings you build must be staffed. Hiring can be pricey if you go for talented employees, and in fact the economical side of the game can be quite difficult to keep balanced. You need a healthy mix of basic services, entertainment, industrial production, and trading to keep flush with cash, which is actually energy that keeps your station humming as well. There's enough going on to find yourself overwhelmed just keeping up with the basic operation of your station, to say nothing of garbage piling up or spies planting bombs around the place.There's a five-part tutorial that'll teach you the basics of the interface, and then a ten-mission campaign that drills down on the different aspects of stations. You might have to run a medical station, or a trade hub, or take over a derelict station from squatters. The first five are almost like an extended tutorial, but the latter half can be intensely challenging. A mission will generally take you about an hour but the more difficult ones might need several restarts, their striking difficulty almost requiring foreknowledge of the mission's quirks. If none of that sounds appealing there is an incredibly customizable sandbox mode where you can set victory conditions and individual difficulties to your whims.The basic 3D graphics have held up surprisingly well over the years, from picturesque views up the curves of your station to the little details on each of the aliens. Sound design also remains up to the task, with plenty of understated sci-fi effects and an inviting soundtrack. The big thing that might throw people off is how incredibly British the presentation is, with a dry AI assistant and plenty of off-color humor in facilities like love nests and space discos. Honestly it feels like a sim set in the Hitchhiker's Guide universe, and if that sounds like a good time then you'll get plenty of mileage out of StarTopia. And even if it doesn't, there's a clever, if not perfect, management game to be had.			"

Whether it's scenario play where you're kowtowing to the needs of the Gruelian Workers' Party or groaning over the Space IRA leaving bombs by your sickbays in sandbox, Startopia is easily worth your $6.99.

												For a game that was originally released in 2001, Startopia has held up considerably well over time albeit with the help of a couple of unofficial mods. Sharing a bit of a City Life mechanic in the sense that each of the races all have their likes and dislikes which provides a bit more depth when it comes to prioritizing which facilities to place when, and highlighting the need to satisfy them all since each of them are essential for the success of the station in one way or another.William Franklyn as the voice of VAL is an absolute delight and having a sarcastic accented virtual artificial lifeform to guide you through the missions is a treat compared to other games that have only a textbox for players to read before commencing a mission.

												Do you like space? Do you like simulation games? This game is both of those things. It's in space. It's a simulation game. It's got aliens. It's real good. I mean, I like it. But for serious. Startopia is a space station management game. You must keep the station running well and keep the aliens who live there happy. There are several different species of aliens that all have specific needs and professions. For example, the Greys are natural doctors, the big bulky brown guys are best at security, and the half naked angel people are some sort of consort service. It's a very odd game, but it's a lot of fun. The story missions are interesting and a great way to learn how to play. And at the time of this writing, it's like $1.75. Go git it.			"

												For the life of me, I cannot remember ever buying this game, and yet as soon as I saw the screenshots of the game I remembered the gameplay. Since I had been pining over a space-station sim (since the other game like this one that was on Early Access recently flopped, releasing early without the full range of planned features) I decided to revisit this game. It was well worth the price of admission.You can read up on the history of Startopia on Wikipedia (there's a full article there) which talks about its lighthearted humour and cartoonish aliens and how the game was developed by ex-Bullfrog employees (after Bullfrog was absorbed by Electronic Arts.)While the game was not fantastic for its era (and while no game improves with age), it did sell 110k copies at the time and it has stood the test of time remarkably better than one might have anticipated. The torus floorplan (rounded floors, tiered levels, unlockable sections around the radius of the space station) holds a certain charm. The Targ race of aliens is reminiscent of Grunts from Halo: Combat Evolved (which makes it an interesting bit of trivia that Startopia and Halo were released the same year.) The varied races with their unique professions, the wide variety of mission objectives keeps the game very engaging: mining rest station, medical station, trading station, and even prison station are examples of the first four map objectives.Startopia even supported multiplayer (although I do not expect to be able to actually test that).The game lacks primarily in that it was designed for desktop machines of 13 years ago (as of the time this review was written). The graphics tear periodically as the graphics engine tries to render and hits a snag in translating from the old style graphics code to the newer hardware requirements. The alien avatars are fairly simplistic (although there is lots of emote activity going on and even some dynamic interaction AI that adds a sense of believable life to your aliens.) But the game doesn't take itself too seriously and plays up its cartoonish nature with narration that sounds like it came from Douglas Adams (of Hitcherhiker's Guide to the Galaxy fame.)In conclusion, while the game may not have been worth the full price tag (whatever it was in 2001) it is most definitely worth the lower price tag of today.

												Startopia is an interesting game that focuses around the basic premise of runninga  station with a whole bunch of people you can't directly control. Balance income, expenses, and a whole multitude of other difficulties such as rogue agents bent on sabotaging your station.The game plays very similarly to that of Dungeon Keeper, though without as much of a focus on being evil. This is business after all, and you can't make anything if everyone is dead! The game has a surprisingly witty atmosphere, something you expect from something developed in Europe with an amusing assistant that tries to believe he's perfect and you.. are just you.This is one of those games that I'm glad to see come to Steam, even if it's an older one.

												A space-station simulator. Well, not a serious simulator. It's light, it's a bit cartoon-ish. Build facilities, hire employees, keep visitors happy. It does have a fair amount of combat and killing, but it does not take away from the overall light-heartedness. The biggest problem is trying to figure out how & why things work. The tutorial will tell you what to do. But you will need to read user-created guides to learn the relationships between the various parts, and it is well worth it. I bought this game back in '01, and played the heck out of it. After losing the CD, I bought it on Steam. I would love to see an updated Startopia for modern PC's, but the game runs well regardless. I've recently started replaying the campaign missions and I love it. Highly recommended, and nominated for a 2016 Steam award.			"

												consider my playtime with this game triple what it is stated on steam.in one sentence:  still better than 80% of the ""early access"" games available in it's loosely defined genre, and usually 1/3 or less the price.the player takes on the role of a space station manager in a ""hitchhiker's guide"" inspired universe. the main areas that require player management are: trade, expansion, visitor needs, hiring staff, collection of resources, combat, budgeting, research, and balancing resource needs.there's plenty there to keep the management style ""hectic"" and serene at different points... a player can find themselves at times hectically searching for hard to find planted terrorist bombs, negotiating 2 trade offers and fighting off a breach attempt; and at other times, finding nothing to do but to watch your hippies sowing plants in the bio deck.a classic and well aged ""management"" game.  i played this game from 3 different data sources over the years, and steam's is quite good.  nothing much bad to say about this game, other than at higher levels of resolution the text can be hard to read, so should be played at something more native to what it was made to be played at.buy it if you management games, specifically theme hospital or evil genius.  buy it if you like dry stupid British space humor.

												A classic, charming space station builder. (Can it be 'classic' if it was released in 2001? Well, in my mind it is.) You oversee a space station which aliens visit in the hopes of enjoying classy resorts, getting medical care or just grabbing a bite to eat and a nap before their next flight.Building is usually done by creating a room, then placing objects in the room (much like Theme Hospital). You build on the inside of a torus, and you can move the camera around with great freedom; it's fascinating to look through your torus and see rooms curving upward into the distance. In addition, there's a 'biodeck', where you can shape hills, valleys and lakes with great detail, as well as define different 'climate zones'; alien plants will grow there, which you can harvest for goods...Or you can transplant the plants around your station as decoration.As for gameplay, there are about a dozen missions that introduce aspects of the game in sequence; they're fun, although they can be challenging! You can also rule over a station in your own time in the 'sandbox' mode. Most missions have to do with building a certain structure and making sure all the other basic facilities are in place; a hospital mission, a prison mission, etc.. There's also a mission where you have to trade goods with passing ships; buy low, sell high!One last thing I absolutely must mention is the light-hearted atmosphere of the game. It has a very British sense of humor. Your 'assistant', VAL, sounds like a cross between the Dungeon Keeper narrator and HAL 9000. It's clear the designers were at least influenced by The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The British slang might occasionally be a bit obscure for Americans (""boffins"", ""butcher's hook"") but the game has a great deal of charm. "

												Startopia. Do I have a single friend who knows this game at all? My younger brother would probably be the only one. This is an obscure game that for some reason was forgotten, even by the publishers who (I think) refused to keep the game up to date and thus the Devs themselves kept working on it, making unofficial updates to the small amount of fans it still had. Sad, really. I got it for free a megaton of years ago, and I ended up getting a copy of it on Steam, so I might as well give it a review. As usual, I’m gonna start with what the game does wrong, then move up from there.First and foremost, the community of the game is long dead. And it’s a shame because the game was quite fun on the multiplayer department when it came out (well, “came out”. I got a retail version of the game months after it was released, but it still had players back then).Something that also kinda sucks is that the aliens that can actually fight don’t seem to have any real differences between them when fighting. They just shoot lasers out of nowhere. Fights just go down to which side has more aliens, security robots and security towers.Random events can also wreck complete f#cking havoc on any base, as while some of those events are quite helpful, others are CATASTROPHIC. Think of an alien going into your base, looking like any other of the nearly thousand aliens on your base. Now think that he has an alien parasite inside that, if not treated IMMEDIATELY will kill the host from inside and suddenly have a 5 METER TALL BLACK GIANT SPIDER DESTROYING BUILDINGS AND EATING PEOPLE ALIVE. IT’S LITERALLY THE FIRST ALIEN MOVIE BUT WITH SPIDERS AND MORE DEAD PEOPLE.Lastly, the game can come off as childish in some regards and f#cking creepy and disturbing on others. I’ve already mentioned the damn 5 meter tall spiders, but on the other side you have child-friendly prostitution, as angels give “love” to people who need it. Are you f#cking kidding me, the retail version had a +3 PEGI sticker and 5 hours into the game I’m running a jail filled with serial murderers and having people EXPLODE INSIDE OUT AND HAVING MUTANT ALIENS KILL EVERYTHING. AND NOT EVEN MENTIONING THAT YOU CAN HIRE PEOPLE TO MAKE ACTS OF TERRORISM ON YOUR RIVAL’S BASES. WHO RATED THIS GAME, AND WHO THOUGH THESE THINGS OUT!?Leaving the 5 meter tall spiders out of the way, what do we have left? An interesting take on Sim-like Strategy games. However instead of ruling and making sure a town becomes big and important, you create a space facility to do pretty much anything you feel like.And that should be the biggest point of the game, the freedom on normal games to just rule your side of the station however you feel like. And there’s plenty of useful buildings and things to do, from researching technologies and offering them to other people in trades for more than they’re worth to transform your station into a gigantic space-tourist trap.The game also offers enough feedback about what’s happening, something a lot of Sim games seem to miss entirely. At any moment you can click on an alien and get informed by him what needs your station seems to lack, or maybe you can open the visitors window and check that instead. The amount of races is kinda low, but they’re well done, all of them expanding to their own set of works. Some of them are able to make recyclers and factories work, others can work hospitals, you get the idea. There’s a few that are completely optional to hire like the religious guys who’ll turn your upper deck into some sort of biblical heaven, while the purple medusa hippies will fill that same upper deck with tons of trees that will produce resources.Something I also enjoyed back when I played this game are some of the player interaction stuff. You don’t like how others are attracting more people than you? Hire a spy, send it to some of them and watch on live feed as he places a bomb somewhere, then runs away. Or maybe hold auctions between players with buildings or resources you don’t need. Not many other Sim games offer a multiplayer aspect, and in that regard this game filled that, even though nowadays you will most likely only play against bots.I also really like the laboratories and how the tech tree works. Sure, you can always buy those buildings whenever you get the chance (but for a higher price), but with a lab you can just pick ANYTHING and send it to the lab, where it will be researched and your scientists will discover something from it (for example, sending trash will discover recyclers and trash-cans). I also find it great fun that you can even send CORPSES OF ALIENS WHO DIED ON YOUR FACILITY, and thus quickly learn why they died, being either natural cause or not.Do I recommend this game? Yeah. It’s a fun strategy-simulator game with a fun premise. Sure it won’t win any damn awards and it’s community is as dead as progress with Half-Life 3, but for it’s price, you get your money’s worth on value. Specially on a sale.TL;DR Edition: A Sim-like Strategy game where you rule your space station and turn it into whatever you feel like, while 5 meter tall spiders try to eat your tourists. Fun game on a sale, and it’s price is already quite low.			"

												This game amazes me today in the same way as it did it a few years ago. Its not a complicated or very tough strategy game, but its a beautiful and very funny one. You are just controling a space station and its economics, you make your different aliens happy (or sometimes you dont :P). I recommend this game for anyone who wants a few hours of joy by building, expanding and improving your very own space station, or well sometimes you have to fight someone else before it is your very own.

												I first played this game many many moons ago. It was complex for me at the time. I couldn't' keep up, I kept losing objectives. Now that I've been more properly indoctorinated into the Corporate world of micromanagement, this game is a real treat. The graphics are a bit dated, yes. But I think there's still a good solid game here. Reminds me of the 'golden age' of resource management, where you're given a goal and the freedom to achieve it. You'll start out thinking it's easy, but the game just keeps throwing more and more mechanics at you until that moment when ""oh my god, I'm doing it. I'm managing a space station, every thing is ticking along, I'm making stupid amounts of profit...""And then a meteor crashes through your biodeck, killing one of the visiting ambassadors you're supposed to be keeping happy. While you go gawk at the crater, a sabateur plants a bomb on your port, and now everyone is trapped and panicing. You didn't place enough rechargers, so only about 20% of your workforce is responding, and you can't get them to stop picking up all the trash from the panic eating that's going on so they won't repair or build anything. Your resource stockpiles are going to waste on the floor and on the market because you keep missing our on the trade requests from visiting ships WHAT DO YOU MEAN NOT ENOUGH ENERGY TO BUILD MORE SCUZZERS?!?! OH GOD PLEASE SAVE ME ARONA.			"

Similar to Space Colony but on a station, playing away and building rooms to keep visitors/residents happy then to get an asteroid warning keeps you on your toes.Deffinatly one of the better games I have played in a long time.For £4.99 its a bargain, a must buy.9.5/10 or 86/100 "

												One of the best gaming experiences I had in a while.Pros:-Atmospheric game with great, original ideas ive never seen before-Its a tycoon like game with dozents of different aspects. You will have to pay attention to all of them and manage your part of the station otherwise youll fall behind and your opponents will beat you.-Content rich game-There are many awe inspiring buildings and views that will make you say ""wooowdaaam"" (like when you enter your biodeck, lead the camera out through the window and you watch the whole ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ donout shaped starbase from the outside and the planets in the background)-There are many wicked things that will make you say ""WOWDAMMIT"" (like kitten like creatures who are actualy parasites who will infect your residents and hatch an almost unstoppabe space monster, or a giant sandworm like creature who will swalow your alien visitors for their wicked entertainment - no joke, they will actualy pay for the ""experience"")-Lot of humor-Surprisingly deep and chalenging -Good, smart, unmercyful A.I.-Graphics are great considering the games age-Its just satisfying to watch all the uniqe mechanics working in action-Not to mention the small details, ohh those small little details-Has an unbelieavable twist at the end, once you beat the last mission Cons:-At first Its a bit hard to figure out how the different mechanics work-Too much micromanagement, which is especialy difficult to do perfectly in the late game when you manage like 10 different segments. You will still have to look over hundreds of different things yourself, one by one in order keep things in balance, while you are waging war against multipe opponents on multipe frointlines-Short game, once you understand how it works and learn a few tricks the whole singleplayer can be beaten in like 10 hours-About the tricks, there are a few which I would consider game-breaking once you learn how to do them. Game-breaking because the A.I. won't be able to do much against them no matter how far ahead your opponent is, using those tricks can prolong even multi-player games so far you wont have the patience for finishing it My rating is 18 / 20			"

												To date, I have purchased just over 15 games on Steam. Some of them have been complete wastenados of my money - one in particular I shelled out a lot for and only got a couple of hours of semi-enjoyment out of it. Startopia is the exact opposite of that game - I paid very little for it and, so far, I've gotten more hours of fun out of it than any other game I've purchased on here.You're managing a space station which is being visited by nine different alien types, each with their own preferences and skills. You have to build facilities to ensure these aliens are healthy, well-rested, well-fed, entertained and other things like that, make sure any aliens who cause trouble get rehabilitated, keep the station clean, and make sure you have enough energy to keep it all running. You're aided by this artificially intelligent being called VAL who often peppers his advice with a degree of snark and you get occasional visits from a trader named Arona who I swear is a cross between a Vogon and Moneybags from Spyro 2.Speaking of Vogons, if you pay attention to VAL's messages and the descriptions of each individual alien, you might notice qutie a few sci-fi references in this game, particularly Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ones.The graphics aren't brilliant and a lot of the animations do look kinda like the aliens are miming their actions rather than actually performing them, but they're good enough for what this game needs. The music isn't particularly great either but it does help to provide a great atmosphere. You're given a few tutorial missions to help you get to grips with the mechanics and then there's ten proper missions for you to do, each one focusing on a particular aspect of gameplay, like healing sick aliens, putting criminals in the slammer and cultivating resources on the bio deck. And then there's sandbox mode, where you can set things up how you like. Personally, I like just using it to see what I can actually do.Not that this game is perfect though. The combat system feels kinda loose. Like, I know that by clicking on the enemy I'm telling some of my guys to attack, but how many? And placing and managing muster points is just awkward. There is also this bug where if a gem slug sits at a table in a cocktail bar or gets in one of them slug baths, it will never ever leave the table or bath and it will die. I don't think this is too bad because, by the time you're building those things, you should already have plenty of energy in reserve in case of bad things happening. Plus, you could always handwaive it as the slugs dying in their own excesses or something. Finally, after completing all ten missions, unless you're willing to use sandbox mode to make your own, the replay value of the game diminishes.Really, though, those are the only bad things I can think about with this game, and I'd say it's easily worth at least double the price it's being sold for. I'd be willing to pay triple.			"

												It was the little details about this game that I liked. In pretty much all games where you collect resources they dissapear and the only reminder of their existence is a number on your hud. In Startopia your items and resources are all stored in these big storage racks and you can actually see each individual box and even pull it into your item grid or inventory by clicking on them. The teleporter is one of the things I like a lot about this game. At one point there was a terrorist dropping bombs around my spacestation and right before the bomb was going to explode I placed it into my item grid. I was then able to place it in an unpopulated corner of my station so it could detonate safely. When you purchase things from a merchant ship it doesn't just pop into your inventory. The ship has to first ask permission to dock with your station, then after the ship docks with your station you can purchase things from them and the boxes are dropped off outside of their ship, finally the droids that take care of your station come over and pick the boxes up and put them in storage. Or, if your impatient or the droids are busy then you can pick them up with your teleporter and place them in the storage racks yourself. It's things like this that make this game so amazing. I would really like to see more of this in modern games.			"

												To be clear I bought this game many many years ago and I've played it a LOT longer than my listed time. Just happens I lost my original disk registration key and had to rebuy. So I -do- know what I'm talking about on this.This is kind of a mix of a ""The Sims"" title and a potluck of many other game genres. There's combat, there's construction, there's 'farming' of a sort, trading, healthcare, and well.. You run a space station 'ring', or waystation as the game calls them. All in all it's often head and shoulders above anything that recent science fiction, future space life sims have given us in the recent year or two. And I'm not just talking about blowing Moonbase Alpha outta the water, that could be done by a wet dish towel and a piece of cheese. (Don't try to imagine how that'd work, any method you think of would be inestimably better than Moonbase Alpha)At seven dollars, currently this game is a bloody steal, and can provide hundreds of hours of engaging, even if a tiny bit repetitive once you figure out what you think are the 'best' arrangements of rooms and facilities on the various station decks. It has a curious sense of humor, kind of charming really, and never misses an opportunity to poke fun at various sci-fi references. If you want to know what I mean, look up ""Startopia Intro"" to find the original game introductory video, and that'll show you exactly what sort of strange humor you might be dipping into. Personally I love this game to bits, and I really think everybody in my friends list who has even a glancing interest in science fiction or simulation games should pick it up. Heck, everybody who ISN'T in my friends list should pick it up too, Mucky Foot was an excellent development studio, and should never have flatlined like it did. Just the times they were in, I guess?TL;DR - Buy this game now or I'll have a skrasher feast on your lower abdominal organs. Seriously, don't mess with the 20 foot tall murder-beetle. BUY IT.			"

It's too bad there won't be a Startopia 2.  I would buy that before they could even think about making it buyable.There are a few bugs with the game however, some fixes exist.  If you get screen flickering, change the game to use Blip in the options.  You'll figure out which option it is.  Don't minimize the game or the flickering will come back.On rare occasion, the sluggerpartments also causes the game to crash, save before you try to make one.

Startopia has:+ Legalized prostitution+ Cranky aliens+ Sarcastic JARVIS before there was a JARVIS (film AI version, not the freaking butler)+ A sly trader who will insult you and compliment you in the same breath whenever he's about+ Really crappy prison system, my prisoners keep escaping and killing tourists help.I played this game for ages when I was twelve or so. Loved it dearly, and after a few hours of playing it yet again, it still holds up. The graphics are typical early-2000s, the music can get borderline annoying if you don't go up to the Pleasure Deck frequently to decompress, and those stupid meteors will blast through level three right through your ~love~ shop every. single. time. but the replay value is wonderful and it doesn't get boring. The cutesy kitties that spawn and turn into massive spider monsters make sure of it.			"

												Though I haven't played the Steam copy much, I've actually owned Startopia since shortly after its release in 2001, and have spent *countless* hours playing it. This is technically my fourth copy of it. The first was my brother's; he'd loaned it to me, since I loved the Dungeon Keeper series so much. I got a lot of use out of that disc before it was broken.I found an inexpensive replacement on eBay, so I bought two, one for me, and one for him. Eventually, my disc got a scratch -- just one single scratch -- in the perfect place to keep it from being used to install, though it still could be used to play. At some point, my computer had a meltdown, and I needed to reinstall Startopia, so I asked my brother to borrow his copy. He let me just keep it, since he never played it anyway.And even though I still have both of those discs sitting with all my other games, I still snatched up the Steam copy the instant I saw it, because it is worth every penny.For anyone who likes games like Dungeon Keeper, and its spiritual successor War for the Overworld, Startopia is definitely a good investment. The different unique species have their own specialties, likes, and dislikes, with missions that focus on each one. The Sandbox mode has a large range of options to customize your game. The controls are smooth and easy. The two main NPCs with speaking roles are amusing and well-voiced.The one and only complaint I've ever had about Startopia is that it's full-screen only, and can sometimes crash if you try to alt-tab to different windows. Despite that, it's still one of my absolute all-time favorites, and I can't recommend it enough.			"

												Startopia is a gem, the kind that is usually hidden.If you ever played god games years ago you probably heard of a company called Bullfrog, and you probably liked the games they made because they were the sort of games where the innovative design and tight characterzation of every game element?Startopia is half of them continuing to do that with (Muckyfoot) while the other half goes to work with EA(Lionhead studios, formerly led by Peter Molyneux).You are in charge of a part of a circualar space station and your job is to take care of the aliens tourists, hire employees kill intruders and do whatever it is you have to do in each mission (same as multiplayer).The game is full of sci fi references but that's not a bad thing because unlike today's game, the jokes are incorporated into the gameplay, instead of having them blatantly put in your face (well, at least for the most part). There's the narrator and advisor AI VAL, who sounds like he is voiced by Stephen Fry which is awesome. There is the queue of items you can teleport around with sound effects that wouldn't look out of place in a star trek episode. and there's aron daal, a shady trader that might have been a reference to star wars i guess.Besides all that, the presentation is near flawless. If black and white blew my mind by how much you can have your world open and explorable in a god game while still having tight gameplay, StarTopia excells by giving you amazing possibilites with limited space and set pieces.If I have to give criticsm, I'd say that there's maybe a bit too little things to actually do, which might date the game a bit compared to the average run time of a modern game. This is a nitpick though, the game is fun as balls and you should really get it and see for yourself.			"

												One of the best strategy games I've ever played.  There's a number of custom missions available out there on the web to keep things interesting as well.  Good humour, easy to follow, wonderful interface and well polished.Even 13 years later I consider it a great classic			"

												This is a very fun and well-designed management game. You get the freedom to set your space station up how you want; you pick your buildings and place/design them, hire your people, trade your goods, research technologies and design your own bio-deck. The game achieves a good balance, often times keeping you very busy and struggling to keep your station running. The game is not too hard, but there's definitely legitmate threat of losing everything you've worked to build. Sometimes you might feel like you're absolutely crushing a mission or opponent, other times you're getting breached and don't have enough employees to repel the breach, and you just know you're kissing a part of your station goodbye. I'd say just in missions alone you can get 30-40 hours of play time, depending on how fast you complete them. And the sandbox mode will add some time on top of that for you. This game has some replayability, too. You could come back to it in a few months or a year and be sucked in all over again. If I had complaints, one would be the combat in the game. You can take sections of the station from other administrators, but the combat is pretty hands off for the most part. You initiate the breach and your people take care of the rest. I also found myself wanting a little more interaction with the employees I hired. When you first look at a potential candidate for hire there's a whole interface, but I was slightly let down when I realized all you can really do is hire, fire and promote. But that's just a very small ""I wish I could do more!"" thing. This is an older game, and the graphics are pretty much on par with games of it's age. Overall, I'd say great game. If only there were a sequel, or something similar that's on-par.			"

												Played this game when it originally came out over a decade ago and it's still one of my favorite simulation games.  The scope of things to do in this game is awesome, especially with the sandbox mode.  I believe this was made by some members of the team that developed Dungeon Keeper and this game was originally billed as a Dungeon Keeper in space.  You are in charge of a space station containing 3 different levels (Industrial, Commercial, Bio) and expandable sections of a Torus (Wheel) style space station.  Either completing set-objective missions or in a sandbox environment either alone or vs an AI/Multiplayer.  The bio deck was touted as revolutionary at the time and still is quite the novel gameplay feature.  Essential you terraform the landscape of the deck in terms of altitude, moisture and temperature in order to grow different alien flora to harvest as different resources either for trade or manufacturing.Resource Farming (Biodeck), Combat, Staff Management, Building Management, Sanitation (Beam up that trash or you'll get space rats that mutate in huge monsters!), Trade, Spies, Religion just to name a couple of the myriad of things to keep track of as station administrator... it really does make this station feel alive.Pros:So much to do on 3 different decks of your space stationGreat voice acting (Guy who was the voice of the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary phase is the main actor in this)Biodeck was/still is a great feature.Cute graphics and humorCons:No first person mode like in Dungeon KeeperBeing over a decade old, expect no updates or fixes.

												This game is amazing and weird - in all of the good ways.It's not my intention to guide readers through it's features and characteristics, given that you can find such information everywhere else in the galaxy.This game makes you think why there aren't more games that, so vividly, expresses the meaning of ""labour of love"".A seemingly simple sandbox/management game from Mucky Foot - a company that went under yet many people make yearly rituals to try to find and summon their developers - it's also, for the surprise of the unware, a game from Bullfrog, since some or all of it's developers went to Mucky Foot (I don't know all the details, though).If you are reading this and have no idea who or what Bullfrog is, I suggest you to fix that. Now.This game made me love videogames more than I ever did, and it was a big part of my childhood. Figuring things out in a era were I had no manual or plenty of internet wikis and forums available was epic. Anyone who pick this up should do themselves a favor and not spoil anything for themselves.In terms of story and missions, the game is not that big of a deal - unless you go back to 2001 were this was incredibly different from other real-time strategy/management games.The gameplay, living universe (well, station) and the little details is where it's at.Given that this game is around 13 years old, I won't go any further. However, I must note that playing this game still fells refreshing, very fun providing with weird moments (again, in the good way), which make me smile proudly knowing that I invested my childhood in such great experiences.If you STILL haven't bought this game, I seriously don't know what the hell you're waiting for.

												Fun little game where you build and manage your own part of a growing space station.  Think of something along the lines of SimCity but on a smaller scale with a variety of different areas, buildings and aliens.  Replayability is low though.  Once you've finished the game there's not really a lot more to do than repeat the same missions that you just finished or to go through randomly generated generic missions.			"

												A criminally underrated game, Startopia is fantasy/sci-fi business simulation/space station manager videogame made by Mucky Foot Productions (formed by ex-Bullfrog employees) and published by Eidos in 2001, in which the Player takes the role of a space station administer and with a British AI sidekick called VAL (Virtual Artificial Lifeform) at you side you managed various space stations with the task of developing them into popular hubs.Think Dungeon Keeper/Theme Hospital in space. Like in dungeon Keeper you have no direct control over the aliens that visits and wander about your station. Instead, it is your job to construct rooms and hire aliens to staff them. Each building or room provide basic necessities as well as recreation, encouraging visitors to remain on the station and continue spending their money.Startopia has a comical overtone, with lighthearted humor and cartoonish aliens that draws inspiration from and makes frequent references to mainstream science fiction, such as Star Trek, 2001: A Space Odyssey (the player's assistant computer VAL, is a parody of Space Odyssey's HAL), Red Dwarf, and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Startopia is dedicated to the memory of Douglas Adams, author of The Hitchhiker's Guide, who died during the game's production.More information I have placed a address to a Website that has detailed guide on Startopia that allot of fun to read.http://www.rakrent.com/rtsc/rtsc_startopia.htmThis game in my eyes is the true spiritual successor of Dungeon Keeper, it was even made by ex-Bullfrog employers who created the original Dungeon Keeper games. Even after all those years Startopia is still allot of fun and more than worthy to have in your Gaming Library. "

												My Favourite Tycoon game ever. It was quite a unique Sim game where you manage a space station while dealing with needy peeps and maintaining your profits. I loved how the entire stage takes place in a donut station and when you can see half of your station from ground view while you can see the whole station from the bio deck including you opponents bio deck. This game had excellent british humor and hilarious joke hidden the peeps details. It seems easy working 1/4 of a station but it can be tedious rebuilding a captured section. Fighting in Startopia is a bit unimaginative with peeps just standing still while taking shots from lasers and the A.I can be annoying when he hires all his peeps by the boatload leaving you overwhelmed if your defence force are scattered in the battlefield. Overall, the game is a classic and i will recommend it to anyone who enjoys tycoon games.			"

												Pretty damn good for a game made in 2001, in fact one of the best theme park/tycoon type games ever made. It's most unique and fun feature is the biodeck, the third and innermost floor of the station which allows you to raise and lower terrain, change the soil wetness and tempurature. You can also place pools of water in order to make puddles, swamps, lakes and oceans. It's not just for looks though. Conditions on the biodeck effects what plants you grow, which ties into the game's economics, crafting and research systems.The game does have a few annoying design flaws. You have to do some tedious micromanagement once and a while in order to avert disasters and the game doesn't really give you any tools to automate things. For example, employees need promotions once and a while or they'll quit, and the only way to know that the need them is to check the employee list and look for flashing stars, then click each one individually. You can get free energy due to a random event, but you need to notice the event notification and click it as soon as possible.There's also combat, but like in other similar games such as dungeon keeper, it tends to heavily reward getting a huge bunch of guys together while heavily penalizing not having overwelming force. There's really no need to charge the players an energy penalty when one of their units dies in battle. They already paid energy to recruit the unit and it just means losing a battle loses you the game. Unlike dungeon keeper, battles tend to be fairly dry - rather than different units having different kinds of attacks, everyone just uses a sci fi blaster. It's really the weakest part of the game.Still, the fundamentals of the game are sound and the biodeck more than makes up for the annoyances the game makes you put up with.----Tips:Make sure you place enough litter bins around your buildings. Dinomats need 4 in each cardinal direction, while shops need 3 directly in front.			"

												I played this when it came out and now that I played it again I remember what's wrong with it.Every game is the same. You get a circular, bare station to build square rooms in. Their placement doesn't really matter except for some weird things (you can build a food dispenser on the first deck, but you really shouldn't because it will create litter which attracts monsters, the game doesn't tell you that at all). The rooms are unbalanced and money comes easy if you know what to do. Building an Oroflex, for instance, will make most other forms of entertainment useless. The station is empty and featureless so there's nothing to work around. In Dungeon Keeper you have terrain features that make for different levels, but not in Startopia where everything is just bare floor.The presentation is cute and the aliens are funny at first, so you'll probably enjoy your first game but then it gets really old really fast. Combat with other station occupants is boring and gamey so you want to turn off AI opponents really. Disasters aren't interesting either, things just get destroyed and you have to rebuild. That's it. The only highlight is the biodeck which you can terraform for different aliens, so that hippie aliens can grow different plants which you can transplant to the lower decks, although why would you do that when there's no real challenge and the plants don't really change anything? You can sell them as produce I guess for money, which is easy to get anyway. Nothing interesting happens, your actions and planning barely matter and a lot of objects and rooms simply don't do anything.It's just not a good game.			"

												Lots of fun but its a maddening game. Here's a couple of examples. Each alien has about five things that need to be satisfied like hunger, cleanliness, fun, etc. In most games you'd just click on the alien and you'd be able to see which category is the problem but in Startopia you have to click on each category and then wait for the delayed physical reaction of the alien. It can take a long time for one creature and there are a lot of creatures. It makes me nuts. Sometimes, yes, they do get a floating balloon which I think means they need fun. I'm never really sure. You also have to hover your mouse each category and wait for the tool tip to pop up. This is bad in a game where the doors to the next sector can open up and a swarm of enemies can disable your equipment and kill your guys in a hurry. Then there's another aggravating thing that is just needlessly odd. You have a management screen. I didn't know this until I played for about 30 hours but you can promote people from this management screen. They sort of paste a promotion star to your cursor if the alien feels like it needs a promotion if its not going to quit it's job. Elsewhere you click on something to promote the alien so this different way of doing things on the management screen threw me off as I was trying to click on things and promote aliens whether they felt like they deserved it or not. The second failure in both these things is that they aren't mentioned in the tutorial and they make the game play quite a bit better. They're sort of essential. Its too bad because Startopia is really neat game. Its fun, creative, unique and its deep. There are many hours of gameplay but there are things you have to put up with that other games like Tropico, Rollercoaster Tycoon and Railroad  Tycoon did better. Definitely a good buy.			"

I. Love. This. GAME! I've played a lot of city building type strategy games, SimCity, Rome Total War, WarCraft, StarCraft, their sequels, and more. This one is unique in a number of ways. It has charm, amazing attention to detail, and an awesome set of missions that really introduce you to the game. I played this when I was younger and it had just come out and fell in love. I kept coming back to it even when I lost the disc and my graphics card couldn't handle the textures. I'm not gonna lie, I pirated this game so many times just so I could keep playing. And I bought it, despite the fact that I didn't necessarily have to, because it's just that good and these developers deserve the money. I don't know if you're still in business Mucky Foot, or who owns the rights to this game, but I would KILL for a sequel! The economy is incredibly diverse and you can inhabit any sector of it that you wish or fits the mission. Grow or manufacture basic goods to sell, buy basic goods and research more advanced buildings, or be a straight trader and buy low from certain alien races and sell high to others. You can focus on tourism, religious pilgrimages, security and war, farming, or manufacturing and selling. Certain aliens will do certain jobs that are vital to basic functions and making money. There is fine detail control on what buildings charge for services, Roller Coaster Tycoon style. (P.S. SimCoaster is better!) And VAL, your AI helper, is hilarious.If you like city building games with an awesome economy system ....in SPACE!, then get this. It stands the test of time. Graphics are a bit old, but they still look damn good. In fact, I've made myself want to play it again right now!			"

												There are few older games I remember as fondly as Startopia, and it's one I still return to 13 years later. You start with a single room in mostly derelict toroidal space station. Your job is to get this station back on its feet, popular, and profitable. Place everything from bedrooms and bathrooms to entertainment facilities, medical bays, research stations, and more. Keep an eye out for troublemakers. Tighten up security. Trade with passing freighters. Terraform a biodeck and use it to grow harvestable plants. There's even a tech tree. I would highly recommend this game to any fans of Dungeon Keeper, Evil Genius, The Movies, and even games like Dwarf Fortress and The Sims.			"

												since its release i have played this game over and over again and every time it's both amazing fun and an enjoyable challenge.if there's one game i install and play pretty much once a year then it's this one.the game's biggest strength is that it's a truely unique one. at least i don't know any game that comes even close to startopia.your job in startopia is pretty simple:you're the manager of a big donut-shaped space station and your task is to cut a profit!a donut with three layers that is. the lower deck is pretty much the working area, the middle deck is the pleasure deck for all kinds of fun and amusement and the upper deck is the bio deck for relaxing and enjoying the view.building your facilities is only one part of the job. of course you need power to run everything  and robots to keep everything clean and tidy. all sorts of aliens will come to your station to have a shower, take a nap, get some eats, dance and shop on the pleasure deck, walk around the bio deck and then visit the doctor before leaving the station. with empty pockets since you made them spend all their money on your station! obviously every alien race prefers other things and every race has their own abilities so you may want to recruit some of the more talented ones for your staff. after all your station doesn't just run itself. you can even hire some farmers to spice up the bio deck. either for the good looks or to box the stuff and sell the goods! you can even shape the bio deck to your liking. and again the different alien races prefer different environments. random events keep everything interesting while you branch out into the space trade business and maybe even set up your own factories. after all buying stuff is not as cheap as making your own with your slaves. employees i mean. talking about puns, the game has lots of them. just great!there's a research system for the eggheads and for the brutes there's combat. sometimes you need to keep your station safe from spies and other unwanted guests. sometimes there are competing station managers around and they may try to take over your part of the station by force so don't go cheap on turrets and armed security personnel.this game has a lot of depth but at the same time it's not too hard to pick up.if you like management games then you absolutely  have to give this one a try.despite its age the graphics are still quite neat, sound and music are great as well and like i mentioned already the gameplay is just as awesome as it is unique.if there's going to be a startopia 2 some day i'm willing to pay an arm and a d#ck.

												Quite simply the best rts/city builder/sci-fi hybrid I have ever played. This game is fun incarnate. Not to sound too cliche but the worst part of this game is that it ends. Classic then, classic now. Don't miss out on this title!			"

												This is one of those timeless games that will always be worth a playthrough. It's aged well and has a fun Dungeon Keeper style of humor you don't find as often these days. You can do a quick playthrough, start to finish, in around 10 - 15 hours and the free play sandbox mode is good for another 10 or so. I really got into the terraforming and farming aspect and dumped a bunch of time into making a thriving farm on the greenhouse level with a massive shipping port below decks. If you were a fan of Bullfrog's collection of building/strategy games in the 90s and haven't played this title before (or if you have and can no longer play your old copy on your newer system) this one is a must have.

												This game is a must-play for those that remember and enjoy strategy/management/city-building PC games of the late 90's and early millenium.  While not incredibly difficult in the managerial department it is bursting at the seams with charm and character.  In fact that is where I'd say the game's only faults lay; it could use more micro-management and nuance.  You basically lay out your buildings and keep the people happy but what makes them happy only varies from mission to mission.  If you're looking to analyze and manage financial spreadsheets then look elsewhere but if you're looking for a fun and relaxing city-builder than buy this game.  It's worth it.			"

												For a game that's as old as it is, this is a surprisingly good management simulator. Essentially a 'space station tycoon' game.The game does a good job of easing you into the interface, which at first glance seems a bit hard to comprehend. And once you get to grips with it, there are a number of 'missions' you can unlock. These are unlocked linearly, although personally I find that these are more different game modes than anything. I.e. you optimise for healthcare or profit etc. in different missions.The gameplay goes much beyond a generic tycoon game though, because it delves into a full simulator, where you can manage right down to the level of individual aliens, of various types.There's a loose story attached to it, but it's nothing big. But the character who is helping you along is quite funny, and the entire thing is quite light-hearted. It's not a causal game, but it's definitely not something super-serious.There's some good music. The art is of a high quality, if very low resolution.A pretty good management simulator.			"

												Never played this before I bought it, and I have to say, for a old game it's fun. It can get a *tiny bit* repetetive but at the same time its challenging and fun. you can't just rush in and build and win. you have to plan and care and...find love xD. Either way, very fun for such a old game. highly recommend. just wish there where more official missions.			"

												Game is kind of like a small spaced based sim city, I cannot say it is amazing but I enjoyed playing it. The game has a rudimentary combat system with player-hired aliens and robots duking it out with hostile life forms that either infiltrate your community or try to invade your docking habitations.You hire other aliens to operate certain aspects of your station like Sirens that look a bit like angels that work in the space-based equivalent of a house of ill repute. Though I say that, the game is not that seedy, so do not expect anything shocking coming from that aspect. You balance the needs of your residents and cash income by creating different facilities across three separate sections of the space station you reside in. The first section is going to house living areas for your crew, medical facilities, jails, recycling plants, etc. The second section is the entertainment area where you put those said houses of ill repute, casinos, and anything available to bring in visitors and increase your income. How much you charge in itself is up to you and you can set the price for goods and services. The upper most section of the space station I guess is for creating a nature area; I never quite understood the point in the place other than having habitat zones for each type of alien. Though this game does offer a lot in terms of content, it really just feels like you build endlessly until completing your idea station. As a result, the game feels a bit above average it is not a bad game, in fact it is actually a good game. However, because of the repetitious nature of the game I lost interest quickly, so though I recommend this game, I do so in a sense that the game is a good single play through.   "

												Since its release, this is a game that I have gone back to in my mind, even if I haven't been able to play it. While the gameplay is a slightly challenging resource management with a dash of The Sims, the atmosphere and universe the game takes place in is what has always sold me on it. A Douglas Adams/Red Dwarf sci-fi universe in which two-headed scientists need love from sultry sirens, four-armed farmers grow crops alongside alien monks. Your assistant is a sarcastic AI who is a bit more Marvin the Paranoid Android than GLaDOS. The missions are challenging, combat isn't super intuitive, and it has glitched out on me a few times. Why do I keep going back? I want to see what happenes when you research the alien artifacts, or what kinds of plants give me what kinds of cargo. There is always something to do in this game, some way to expand, some way to grow and become the best Station Administrator in the 'verse.			"

Why have those ages gone?I have no idea, but I'm glad this remnant has stayed.It's very rollercoaster tycoon. It's also worth noting that in this game, the tutorial is actually needed. You will have no idea what to do without it, it is instrumental. Don't play this game without the tutorial and come back to give it bad reviews.

												I played this games for days and days when it first came out. Saw it again and surprisingly it holds up perfectly. Some people have screen flickering issues, which you can change the vsync to fix. The only negative is that the text doesn't properly scale with resolution, but you aren't going to be playing a 13 year old game for the graphics. There is literally no game quite like this available today, I wish there were other games like this to play, but for now I'm going to keep playing this one.			"

												Startopia could have easily been titled ""Space Station Tycoon"". You control the success of a space station inhabited with a variety of alien races. You place buildings and ammenities to keep everything in order and make more folks move aboard your station. Different disasters can happen like rat infestations or plague or spy infiltrations. You continue to expand and develop your station.I would pay special note to the narrator/assistant in the game as a proto Wheatly/Stanly Parable narrator. It is a 13+ year old game, don't get me wrong. But the biodeck is pretty relaxing and it is usually very cheap especially when it is on sale. I recommend it to anyone who is a Tycoon game fan and enjoys those type of games... in space... with British narration.Entertainment: 6Value: 8Genre: 7			"

												This game starts out really slow.  I had some trouble with it at first, figuring out the economy.But after playing for a little while, it quickly becomes very engaging and hard to stop playing!  This is an under-appreciated gem - very cute graphics and endearing characters, and the game flow is captivating.  There's always something to deal with.It's a city-building game - but you're building a city on a space-station which is a spinning ring to generate artificial gravity.  There are 3 layers (levels) to build on and associated costs for unlocking more space to build in.  There's also space management (not very fun) for cargo holds.  There's also occasional sabotage, which can bring your whole economy down if you aren't careful and run out of funds after a bomb goes off.  The driving force behind the game is 1) the character personalities and 2) the economics.			"

												An amazingly well aged sim game. The only real artifact of it's time is a slightly clunky interface, but that never really gets in the way of its enteratianment value. The game has a great atmosphere for waht it does, and gives the player to set up whatever space station concept they could ever dream up, with several examples being given in mission mode.Space Hospital? Sure!Intergalactic Trading Post? Capitalism HO!Inter-Planetary Penitentiary? The Princess is in Cell Block AA-23Not sure about this high-tech Tom-Foolery? Set up your agrarian utopia on the Bio-Deck!And when you have the station of your dreams set up the art design makes it joyful to just watch the kalaeidoscopic crowd go about its business.			"

												I played this game as a kid and loved it. Coming back to it as an adult with a more mature mindset, it feels like an entirely different game in a way. As a kid, I had no idea why I kept having my people explode into giant aliens that went on rampages. I had no clue about proper research/build priorities or how to tailor each sector for my different races.Now that I'm an adult, I do! It took the game from being a funny city-builder type thing, to a more complex one with Tycoon/Management vibes and hostile take overs! What I'm trying, poorly, to say is that this game has only become more enjoyable from my days as a kid, and that anyone looking for a bit of fun that's not too casual, should give this game a try.EDIT: I did have one problem with it giving me an error when trying to launch it. Turned out to be due to my monitor resolution, and the fix was super simple! Just add /r  and then whatever your resolution size is by right clicking your game, selecting properties, and then set launch options. In my case, it looked like /r1920x1080x32 and it solved my issues with the game failing to launch. The 32 at the end is the OS I think. Been awhile, but give it a go, and if 32 doesn't work, 64 should.			"

												This game reminds me a little of Space Colony (another older title which will soon be on Steam).  So far, I have not been disappointed, especially given the price.  If you like science fiction games and space station management, I highly recommend considering this title.			"

												Used to play this when I had a subscription to Gametap, bought it on Steam last year only to find that it was unplayable due to the fact that, well, it's old(ish?) and my computer is apparently too awesome for it's own good.  Was unable to resolve the issue at the time and gave up (I've dealt with compatibility issues plenty of times so if I can't find a workaround, the program itself is borked), totally bummed that I waited too long to file a claim for a refund.  HOWEVER...Accidentally launched the game last night and...  It works now.  In fact it works just fine.  I don't have any idea how, but it works.There is something addictive about this title that I can't quite pinpoint.It's a builder for sure, but more in the vein of the Tycoon games IMO.There is also something inherently irritating about it.The controls and interface are odd, clumsy, and counter intuitive at times.The visuals are decent, albeit cartoony.Honestly I wish I could give it a neutral rating, because the pros don't out weigh the cons and vice versa- it's not a bad game but it's not great either.  I'm going to go ahead and give a recommend though, simply because the price is low.			"

												Mix ""The Sims"" with ""SImCity"" on a space station. Manage your aliens needs and make some cash. Build some more. Deal with the random tasks given to you through each mission. Really fun game.But the end game gets buggy. Your ""maintenance robots"" do a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor job at managing tasks. There's a pile of things to do and there are 20 bots swarming to build 1 item instead of 5 building the item and the other 15 maintaining the station.Also, the game might have had an extended life if it had a couple other stations that wasn't the basic ""3-level circular station"".

Purchased it on steam recently and it won't work - I have to click through 7 or 8 crash messages every time. Valve has been no help, the developer (Gathering of Developers) is long gone, and no one knows how to get this working on Windows 7.I had expected that if a game is being sold on Steam, the game would work on most common hardware. I guess my i5 running Windows 7 is just too esoteric for this one.Update: I can't post this review until I've let the game crash for a full 5 minutes.			"

Posted: June 29, 2015
												A very confusing and overall lackluster RTS management game. You're given three floors of a space station to work with. The first floor holds your main focus, where you will be building docking ports, accomodations, labratories, and a bunch of other stuff. The second floor is for entertainment, where you build extravagant restaurants and hotels, discos, and yes, brothels. The third floor is the Biodeck, where you alter terrain and can create different habitats for a species of alien to grow different plants in, which provides you with resources. On each floor, you can purchase multiple adjascent sections as the space station forms a circle. To run many buildings, you will need workers from a good bit of different alien races of which you hire. There's lots of building, trading, and fighting to be done.Now for my complaints. The in-game tutorials do very little in the way of actually teaching you how to play the game. You'll be taught what buildings basically do, but not exactly. You'll learn that residents have different stats, but aren't told how they impact their work. They will briefly touch on fighting mechanics early on, but I didn't encounter serious fighting until 9 hours in and I wasn't close to being prepared. If you press F1 while hovering your cursor over an item, you'll get more information on it. This doesn't work for cargo crates, but only the item after you already own and build it, and most of the information is superficial and not actually helpful. There are also lots of items you can waste precious Energy (this game's currency) on, that ultimately do nothing, such as Benches or Chronometers, despite the game telling you to purchase them. The controls and camera are hard to use to at first and feel very unintuitive. Some things require too much precision and things can end up getting clunky, such as when trying to pick up one item but the it grabs another near it instead. Also a minor issue, is how the Cargo Hold will instantly take any items you purchase but take a long time putting them up, so you won't be able to get them until you end up forgetting you bought them. The list goes on.I got very lucky with most of the missions, completing them an inch away from Game Over, which can be very stressful as each mission tends to take a very long time to beat. You can spend hours on a single mission, and that's not fun when most of it is comprised of a lot of waiting around and wondering if you're playing the game the right way. It's especially not as fun because if you haven't been playing properly, all of that time is a gigantic waste. You can save as many times as you want, and the game cycles through three autosave files as the mission carries on, which is pretty advanced for its time, but if you've been falling behind for the majority of the mission, you'll have to do it all over again anyway. I made it to Mission 7 before I stopped playing. The game wanted me to take over a space station. I spent an hour and a half doing my best to earn as much money as I could, something that was so basic yet still very difficult despite playing this far, only to have my door breached and my base destroyed by an enemy. I forgot the whole two lessons it taught me in the first tutorial on how to fight. I had the right amount of residents the game recommended to me, even moreso, and senty turrets all around, and since the game basically runs on auto pilot I should've been safe enough to reseal my blast doors (something I only knew about because I read it online, as the game doesn't explain this feature). I sealed the doors, with all my battling residents on the other side as I forgot the one, pathetic way you have of controlling them, and for some reason all of my Energy was depleted. Every one of my buildings was shut down and out of power, including my Energy Collector which is what brings me power. I had 0 Energy, no way to get any more, and no idea what was going on. After over an hour and a half, my game was left in an unwinnable state.If you're a fan of RTS-like management games, you might want to get this game only when it's on sale. Otherwise, I can't recommend this game to anyone who doesn't already know how to play it. It does have some charming ideas, like its Sci-fi references and your ""helpful"" advisor, VAL, and a sandbox mode of which I will not be playing, but it isn't enough to save the game from its disastrous design. It's very difficult to get into, and I gave it an honest try and spent 10 hours with it, and I got to the point of where I'm just sick of it now.			"

												Not recommended unless you have some nostalgia for the original.Coming to the game fresh in this day and age, it's a bit of a dinosaur.  First impressions are terrible.  It starts out telling you to close your email, web browser, and anti-virus to get the best performance, then boots up in 640x480.  I played through the first tutorial level before giving up - due to a mixture of poor quality visuals, a terrible control scheme, the confusing stream of tutorial instructions, and the apparent necessity of sitting through more tutorials before actually doing anything fun.It is at least a masterclass in how much UX design has impoved in the last decade and a half.  I don't know for sure whether this version has actually been modernised to any degree, but it doesn't feel like it.  I also don't remember seeing any clear indication on the Steam page that it was such an old game being re-released, which seems important information to me. "

												Honestly I got this for free and kinda wish I didn't. Played for roughly 1.5  hours and in the whole time hardly had a clue what I was doing or what was going on. It isn't very clear what you're hiring people for when you hire them. By that I mean it doesn't tell you what you're hiring anyone for at all. You do, however, get an idea, because every species has a specific job. Somehow this ended up being a game about building stuff when I didn't know what they did whilst building a massive ♥♥♥♥♥-house. For me this literally was Pimpstar Enterprise on its mission to find the Universes' losers. It is a good idea for a game, just the result is poor.			"

												This game is from 2001 but it feels much older in terms of graphics and gameplay.If you think that in 2001 we got games like Max Payne, Bejeweled, Clive Barker's Undying, Black & White, Dark Age of Camelot, Stronghold, Return to Castle Wolfenstein ...... you will understand that this is not one of the top guns.Also no steam cards, no achievements, all you get is a couple of SP missions.I would avoid paying full price for it, for me it's not worth more than part of a 1$ bundle, if you REALLY want to try it.2/10			"

												Poor excuse for a game!well, jeez... dude you would probably get more out of you life buying a scratchie with that money. This game is so crap it lags when everything is turned on minimal, and the automatic setting dont even work it turned the graphics on their lowest, and i have a 280x double-d graphics card! it doesnt fit normal moniters i has the capabilities to fit on a 1980x1080 moniter but all that does is enlarge the background and push everything into one f****** corner! there is no tory and you cant do anything i literally pressed every button and nothing happened, good job ;)screw this game.

												I wish I hadn't bought this game for one reason:  at 1920x1080, I can't read a single word.  The text is so small that I regret the purchase entirely.  If you have visual impairment of any kind (I have an astigmatism) you'll want to commit to a lower graphics resolution before purchasing this game.  Even at lower resolutions, the text is too small for my comfort.			"

												One of my favorites! an absolute reccomendation!Think about a hi-tech/space version of dungeon keeper, a lil less combat and more management.It's a bit dated but still a great game! gameplay itself is really good! ofcourse with a somewhat out dated game the graphics could be beteter but it's not something you get anoyed by while playing.Only wish (apart from the graphics) more campaign missions! this is one of those games where you want more missions! but there are some community compiled missions out there.if you get the chance to try this, definitely get it!When on sale for around €10/15,- it's money well... VERY well spent!			"

												Well worth it at the priceWhile the graphics aren't really up to modern standards (Not a shocker), they do the job pretty well- you can clearly see what is happening, and they don't detract from the game. The gameplay itself is pretty complex, with a lot of factors to balance and some fairly deep management decisions. Would prefer a slightly larger library of rooms and species, but there's still enough to make things interesting, and I'd say the same about a lot of modern games like this that have three times the price tag and a fraction of the effort put into them.The sense of humour has aged pretty well, and the game is pretty good fun.

												A game well preserved the spirit of Bullfrog studio, it reminds me of DungenKeeperThe game mechanism is well designed and balanced, lots of content(room types, decks, events, peeps, etc.), engaging single player missions, challenging through the beginning to the end. Your space station faces all sorts of problem at all stages of its development, keeping the place in shape and satisfying the peeps requires active management and is never an easy task. It's a game worth playing, a game well representing the philosophy and quality of single player games at its peak stage in early 2000s. If you've been through the ""good old days"", this is a fine piece of nostaugia. If you haven't, this will show you a different perspective of what a good game should be like.			"

												I've only just really started playing this but thought it is worth a mention. So far this old classic has ticked all my boxes. If you are a sci-fi fan, like star trek, red dwarf and hitch hikers guide to the galaxy you will love this game.  As soon as you get into it you notice some subtle references such as wooshing doors, teleport noises and a comedian computer narrator.The game itself is a sort of space station sim which can be played through story led missions or in a sandbox mode. The graphics although dated still look good and detailed if you crank up the res. There some neat little animations and you have full 360 views of the station and its rooms. The game itself works in a similar way to other management sims where you will need to keep visitors happy by ensuring there are enough facilities. The more visitors you get the more money the station makes. The game has a simple tutorial that eases you into things and the missions are structured in a way as to not make things to taxing at the beginning. The game can be saved at any point and even if you finish a mission you can still continue on if you want to expand things a little more.I highly recommend this to anyone who likes the genre and setting. I can't recall playing anything else similar to this and the sandbox mode ensures you will come back to it time and time again.Excuse me now as I need to visit the Lavatron ;)			"

												I first played this game a few years ago on a previous PC. It was one of the few games I've deeply regretted losing and have remembered fondly. Now here it is on Steam! And at a cost even penny pinchers won't believe!! Now, the next time my PC breaks down I won't have to worry about losing games since I can just download it again.It's every bit as good as I remembered it being, only this time around I've not had to fuss around like I did last time with patches and setting adjustments to get it working just right. All I changed this time was the resolution to 1920.You know those games that you complete the mission scenarios once and then that's it .... you just don't feel like you want or need to play it again? This is not one of those games. This is a game that you will feel like replaying every now and then, and as such it's a good game to have in your personal game library.Hell, I've been known to waste away some hours just tinkering around on the biodeck. (Damn those asteroids).A quality, fun game, with great replayability value, at a great price.Why aren't you putting it in your cart right now?			"

												I initially thought this was a new indie game and it blew me away. When I read the review on the store page about how this old studio game still solidly competes with great new indie games I was nodding my head hard enough to get whiplash.The combat is pretty bad and the campeign missions mostly all feel like training, but the sandbox is one of the best ""space station/colony management"" games I've ever played. Plus, microtransactions hadn't been invented yet so you can actually just enjoy the sim rather than grinding to get ""coins"" or ""gems"" or whatever. You will find yourself struggling to keep up with the demands of a busy station and will feel like there's always something you're forgetting. You will pull your hair out waiting for someone to sell you the plans for defense columns. You will obsess over the exact right layout of modules to maximize space. You will laugh your head off when you zoom in and look at what your inhabitants are actually doing. In short, you'll love it!			"

Keeping your visitors happy while defending against spy activities (bombs) and other competitors on the space station (war) means a whole lot of juggling of activities while increasing your revenue and bulding new facitilites.You also want to grow crops and earn money. The missions are like a big tutorial that introduce all kinds of activities. Balancing them in a sandbox game is a lot of fun, so I can recommend this game for anyone who likes building simulations.

												It may show it's age, but Startopia is an extremely well made space station management game. The graphics may be a turn-off for some, but the gameplay is really excellent. Your station can be a brothel, a hotel, a hospital, a trading station, or you can focus on the Biosphere and make a terrestrial station. There are 16 sections with 3 layers to each, giving you 48 station sections to play with. The campaign gradually introduces interesting new challenges and mechanics, and there is multiplayer if you can get it to work.			"

												I loved this game growing up and still love it today. I used to play it once every couple of years when I'd find it lying around. It's comical and clever. I wish I could find more games like this. I always reccommend it to friends whenever they ask for a good simulation game.			"

												It may show it's age, but Startopia is an extremely well made space station management game. The graphics may be a turn-off for some, but the gameplay is really excellent. Your station can be a brothel, a hotel, a hospital, a trading station, or you can focus on the Biosphere and make a terrestrial station. There are 16 sections with 3 layers to each, giving you 48 station sections to play with. The campaign gradually introduces interesting new challenges and mechanics, and there is multiplayer if you can get it to work.			"

One of the all time classics for me.It is a simple micromanagment game with a simple 3 tier system of construction, like running a buisness or hotel.Aside from the time tested gameplay (Which was quite new then), the sarcastic and urbane narrator truly sells this game time and again.

Never build a Brig with more than six cells. You can have multiple brigs but never more then six cells in them. And there, problem solved and thet game is good fun.

Even now, 16 years later, it still holds up.  It's a bit opaque, but you'll get the hang of things with the help of VAL.  It's full of life and humor, and it fills a niche that nothing else does.  If you like the sound of running your own space station, give it a try.  You'll be glad you did.			"

												As someone who didn't own this game previously, I can't recommend this primarily based on the fifteen year-old gameplay - which is a fairly enjoyable, if standard, management sim setup with some basic combat and some sandbox elements - but for the comedy value.The main narrator does a more-than-passable impression of Peter Jones as 'The Book' from Hitchhikers' Guide, with other voice actors drawing on other characters from the radio series. Each of the little aliens running around your space stations also have humorous CVs in an Adamsian style, and the wider universe and plot fit into that slightly zany vein (albeit less satirical). The art style is complementary, as is the campaign story.All in all, for those who like tycoon games and/or Hitchhikers' Guide, this is definitely worth retrieving from the archives of yesteryear. It's also worth exploring as game which straddles management sim and sandbox more successfully than some, but, for me, this game is well worth it on comedy alone, especially if you catch it in one of the regular sales.

												So I was put on to this one by a friend for loving Evil Genius, Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy and Douglas Adams humour style. I spent a grand total of 20 minutes on it before realising how much I love it.For starters the game introduces its main campaign with the voice of William Franklyn (the voice of the book from Hitchhikers tertiary phase) as your assistant.The aliens are really damn cute and despite age the graphic style suits the game well.Considering, again,  the age of the game, the controls are not awful like a numer of older pc titles.It doesnt need to be purchased through nostalgia, I didnt have a clue of this games existance until 2016 and I have loved every second of it so far. Take a look folks, I cant say I regret anything with this one.			"

												This and three other games were all bought from my local gameshop for the usual reasons: someone recommended it and it was dirt cheap. I must say I was inordinately happy to find not just something to amuse for a weekend, but a ""proper"" game. By ""proper"" I mean that despite the long tutorials and even longer playtime of the levels (which still feel a bit tutorial-esque), I was gripped for a good 2 weeks or so. Just a couple of hours every night before getting online and getting my daily MMO injection, but it kept me coming back for more.The slight predictability of the level structure after a while didn't deter me either, I wanted that next type of alien so I wanted to get to the next level just so I could get to play with them; see what they could do; work them into my now tried and tested Starbase designs.I must admit however, that at first I didn't have much patience with it. After lengthy tutorials I was getting peeved at the smarmy John Cleese-esque narrator. I wanted to weld his cybermouth shut.But, given time and a little bit of ingenuity with a Recycling Plant I was soon making efficient, profitable, teeming-with-life starbases that lit up the barren, war-torn cosmos ready for a new era of economic prosperity and peace.Sometimes the control can be a little clumsy, and the camera controls take a while to get used to (much smoother now higher res is support). But the semi-intuitive control system and the nice clean HUD/interface more than made up for it. The graphics were good for its time of release and the sound wasn't annoying, on the 2 lower decks it was a background rather than a stimulus or a feature, but my favourite place to take a break from the credit earning worlds of the industrial/pleasure decks was up on the biodeck, with its bizarre yet soothing cosmic harmonies and whale-song-like chirps and blips.As far as value goes you can't fault it; I first bought it in a Sold Out Software box and therefore paid very very little for it (especially as they were doing 3 for 2 and it was the cheapest of the three). This isn't a great game, but it is a good game - and that is a good thing. It couldn't have been much better and remain the same game, but it really only is a good game. But we all need a good game from time to time. Beautiful, epic masterpieces are all fine and dandy, but you'd be worn out if all graphics made your retinas melt and every story was an epic saga.If you see it on sale and have a spare tenner then hell, buy it. It'll be worth the 2 weeks you get out of it.			"

												Oh man, i forgot how much i liked this game... TL;DR + and - at the end... OK, here it goes...The game totally holds up. It still have great management and base building mechanics, something modern games still f*ck up. It is both simplistic, and deep at the same time. You have different ways of achieving different goals, so it is all up to you, in what way you feel comfortable to manage the task at hand.Some negative points are the tutorial, being both overlong, uninformative and boring. You can learn the basics in a few minutes, and you don't really need the tutorial.I can recommend it to anyone, who wants to play great base building/management game from 2001 that does more thing right than modern management games.+ visually looks way way better than most 2001 games+ supports resolutions up to 1080p+ works flawlessly on Win7+ enjoyable management gameplay+ simplistic and deep at the same time- questionable tutorial- higher resolutions the text is unreadable (small)			"
