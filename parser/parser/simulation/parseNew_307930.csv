												Fun casual game. Just wish that there were more dinos and that they would eat people if they got loose. :)			"

												awesome for spending time and building if you don't like SIMS. The expensions don't make much sense though, but I did figure out that if you play this one, all other's load on it normaly.			"

												A pretty nice expansion pack/DLC although,the dinosaur choice is kind of meh because they only have ten dinosaurs and one giant turtle called archelon. The upside to the DLC is the missions, the missions were actually fun ecspecially the one where you had to rescue the dinosaurs from the military. All in all this is a great expansion pack for an awesome game (even though there isn't alot to it).			"

												very fun game although i personally think it needs some more dinosaurs like some kind of sauropod and galimimus. also carnotaurus would be awesome! either way this game is fun and if you learn how to do it right u can go without ever feeding ur dinos! (I dont mean hacking or glitching dont do that XD)			"

												Although this game might now be as good as Jurassic Park Operation Genesis, I still liked it. I can still remeber playing Wild Life Park 2 when I was younger and I always wanted the Dino World expansion but I could reallly never get it. Thank you steam for putting this game up.			"

												I keep getting stuck behind landscaping when in mission mode, there is no way to back yourself out. Keep needing to restart the game and try to find a different route - it's very frustrating for what should be a fun casual game. I'm really disappointed that I spent my money on this.			"

												I wouldn't recommend getting this game. While it was fun for a while it has become super buggy. I also noticed that I was getting a ton of pop ups when I went on the internet. I uninstalled the game because it was so bad I couldn't even use my internet. Uninstalled it and all the pop ups went away!			"

												the first mission is broken, you can't even start the first step of the first mission to progress. that and many models, maps, and textures where Never completed. this is basicly your Zoo Tycoon Clone that is trying to hook you in with Dinosaurs. the only good thing it has is the freeplay or Sandbox mod. but even that shares some glitches and issues.If you want a park builder simulator game, get Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis for XBOX, PC, and PS2. it's way better then this, and it was made back in 2002!    Wildlife Park 2 - Dino World, Just pass it			"

												I purchsed this game for my nephew, but was dissapointed to see the sandbox mode has most of the animals locked. So my nephew cant enjoy this game for what its worth unless i grind for hours to unlock everything for him, which im not going to do. I felt like i have purchased a demo for full price.			"

												The clipping in the game while moving around is terrible, and the quests appear to not work. I was standing right next to ""Sparrow"" for the first quest, and it was still asking me to find her -- I also kept getting graphical glitches where a ""rider"" NPC would flash over the screen for a fraction of a second and be gone. Would not reccomend this game, it is nothing like the original Wildlife Park, which has more of a roller coaster tycoon sort of feel.			"
