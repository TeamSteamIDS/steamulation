								What is Theme Park Studio and who would want it?Theme Park Studio is a sandbox theme park building simulator game with no limits. You can build as much as you want however you want. Once you figure out how the program works, it is really fun and you can make gorgeous things. Gone are the days of being stuck to a stupid grid, forcing strict limitations on where you can put stuff. Also gone are the days where you are stuck with the limited content that the devs provide. Importing new content is easy, and the program is specifically designed for no fuss custom importing of 3d objects, terrain brushes, scenery, textures etc... You can even create and customize your own skyboxes.So you should purchase if:*You want to help out and support some awesome devs who are open, honest, and passionate about their game*You love making pretty things and being creative*You want to get involved in the already awesome growing community and start contributingYou should not purchase if:*You are looking for the next Roller Coaster Tycoon game. This is a sandbox pure and simple. There is no money management or scenarios of any kind. Although there is a strong possibility that it may be added in the future.*You are a party pooper or a hater*You are looking for a 100% perfect feature complete product. It's early access. Do bear that in mind and when they say ""Please only purchase if you are interested in being involved in the ongoing development of this exciting project"" They aren't kidding.I will continue to update this as development continues.

Early Access Review
								From the very beginning, the idea behind Theme Park Studio was to give coaster and theme park enthusiasts an extensive ""toolset"" for constructing complete theme parks. When I first heard about the title, the word Studio indicated that this was exclusively for theme park design, and not some game. This is actually a dream come true for those that simply want a giant sandbox featuring extensive tools to design an entire theme park. You know what kept RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 alive long after Atari abandoned it? A community of creative people who decided to bend the program beyond its limitations.  I know firsthand, as I participated. We went beyond the two expansion packs using tools written by a few talented members, but it wasn't an easy task, as RCT3 was not designed with user modification in mind. Pantera was aiming to fill in a void, by developing the first true theme park creation engine. One of the major draws is its open arms approach to user modification, allowing creative minds to go wild. As months progressed, more and more fans of this genre jumped on the bandwagon, with interests ranging all over the map. Features that weren't originally planned were starting to creep in, like having peeps interact in your park, or a UI that would appeal to a much wider audience. This in turn caused a lot of rethinking and changes, and would push the release date much further away. Most felt it would be worth the wait, while others became inpatient, and wanted something done yesterday. What came out of this was the decision for an Early Access release. This would mean, instead of backers waiting much longer for a finished product, they could ride along with the developer as each planned phase gets implemented and activated. Early Access would introduce the community to one of the main aspects of Theme Park Studio: Landscaping and Scenery.  The landscaping tool in Theme Park Studio is quite impressive. A simple, yet powerful tool set allows you to make instant mountains, rolling hills, deep valleys, rivers with flowing water, or even the glaciated rocks of Yosemite. You can concentrate on small areas, or plop down huge terrain maps and watch as it molds the landscape before your eyes. In addition, new textures can be loaded in to simulate all kinds of terrain that go way beyond the default grassy plains. You can also change bump and diffuse maps to add further realism to your park and its surrounding. Top this all off with an equally capable environment editor featuring modifiable skyboxes as well as fog and light vector adjustments, and you're talking endless variations for your massive land.  One of greatest features of Theme Park Studios is its path making tool. Aspiring designers can simply click and place walkways that curve and stretch any way desired, as the ground automatically adapts to each section planted. Paths can be easily be set to be very wide or narrow, and have automatically generated content like trees, park benches and much more magically adhere to one or both sides; you curve your paths, the tress curve with it! Textures can easily changed from a quaint cobblestone walkway, to a massive stretch of tarmac or concrete. The wrench will be your best friend as you bolt down your paths and everything else you've worked on in the game, to avoid accidently moving things out of place.The heart of any theme park is its scenery, and with TPS's scenery builder, anyone can put together all types of structures for their parks. The built in primitives are simple shapes that can be scaled, moved and combined with other shapes,  while the copy and paste function reduces repetitive building.  Add one of the many built in materials, and you can have some very impressive results. Those with no knowledge of 3D modeling programs will finally have a chance make their own scenery. You can even save and share your custom made pieces.Speaking of 3D modeling, Theme Park Studio will give advanced desingers all the tools they need to import and export highly detailed scenery, whether it be modular building blocks, or complete structures like cafes, shops, bridges and so much more. The flexibility for most of the tools in this game is mind boggling. There are many other features in Theme Park Studio, like advanced lighting, colorizing, material editing, and much more.TPS's early release does not include working flat rides or rollercoasters. There are some, flat rides included, but they are static. The upcoming flat ride designer is set for the next phase which with bring these rides to life with animation. Get set to see an influx of flat rides designed by the community such as recreations of real world rides, along with  new inventions that could be the next best thing!The heart of TPS of course, will be its coasters. Expect to see the same flexibility of Theme Parks Studio's other features to apply hear as well. Pantera is working hard to make sure coaster building is approachable for everyone without forfeiting realism like RollerCosater Tycoon 3 did with its odd physics and questionable track choices on certain coasters. The first person experience was hindered because of this. It's really fantastic to be in with Theme Park Studio from the ground up. Early Access users get a head start, and can report any further bugs while also suggesting new features or changes that will make this the ultimate theme park simulator.  While waiting for each phase to commence, we can take our time designing wonderful landscapes and create all kinds of scenery to share among the community. Trust me, that alone is a lot to tinker with. And finally, it irks me when I read any negative reviews which complain about missing features or an ""incomplete"" product. These folks may either not know what the idea behind Early Access is, or are simply the type who add something to their shopping cart without reading or doing any research. It's like being allowed on a movie set, then attempting to review it before production is complete. Speaking of production, this review is a wrap..Oh, and heads up: Custom Scenery is already beginning to flow!- JCat			"

								I always used to play RCT3 (probably like everyone else). And I have to say this game is very well structured. I will give you a list comparing this game to RCT3 so you can have a better understanding of what each game brings to the table SO FAR. I say so far because this game is still in development, and it could change. Here is my opinion:                                                                     >>>>Theme Park Studio vs RCT3<<<<GRAPHICS:Theme park studio wins this one, it has way better graphics, and antialising makes the game look a lot better as well (if you have the graphics card for it). The water reflections look great, and the coaster detail is a lot better. HD!GAMEPLAY:RCT3 wins. RCT feels like an actual amusement park game, because it has a lot of features like the peeps, stands, money, financing, etc. This kind of stuff made you feel like you were managing your own theme park. Theme Park Studio is still in development, so they might add some more features like this soon. It just feels like more of a sandbox than an actual theme park game.COASTER EDITING:Theme park studio is by far the best editor I have come across. There are so many possibilities for coasters, you can truly make it your own.  Each track segment can be edited to your liking, so you can truly make any coaster you have in mind. It is also very easy to use, with some pre-loaded segments like a cobra roll or a loop. When it comes to flexibility, TPS wins.SOUNDS:Although I have big expectations for TPS to have a great sound library, currently i would say RCT has better sounds. They are more consistent, and they have better variety.  For example, on the megacoaster, the lift chain sound on TPS does not make much sense at all. Also, there is no fading so sounds seem to come out of nowhere sometimes. I do expect them to have better sounds in the future though. USER INTERFACE:I'm going to be honest, the TPS user interface takes some getting used to. The RCT user interface in my opinion is more understandable, and it's easier to use. TPS just kind of seems all over the place.  Maybe they will update this soon, i just find it easier to play RCT instead of TPS. But then again, it's also about personal preference. That should cover most of the basic categories.  In my opinion, I prefer Theme Park Studio over roller coaster tycoon.  TPS is still on the early versions, and it has A LOT going for it once they start adding people, and adding more management features. Don't get me wrong, I will always like rct, but tps seems like the next step up.  That is all! I hope this helps some of you clear up some differences.Have a great day ! Dated: January 15th, 2015*Antialising issue fixed!*			"

								Even though it's early days, this game has massive potential! Unlike RCT3 this provides ultimate freedom and customisation, if you want to build it, you can. Unlike NoLimits 2, it doesn't take a 2 week course of reading the documentation to learn how to use the menus.If your favourite part of RCT was designing parks in sandbox mode, then this is definitely something for you. I can not wait to see where this game ends up down the line			"

								Bought this as an early backer 2 1/2 years ago and I'm still waiting for a playable game/simulation - currently it is almost unusable unless you have 10s of hours spare. Perhaps if the developers stuck to what they said they were going to do rather than spending months adding trendy extras like VR (that the majority of us haven't got and many of us have no intention of getting) they may have delivered on their promises. Currently I feel really ripped off - they've taken my money and ran off and done their own thing. Come on Pantera, please deliver what you promised or refund the money back to us.			"

								Even though Theme Park Studio is harder to learn to adapt with controls and mechanics when compared to RCT3, the game itself has almost no limit in terms of creativity. It lacks the money management aspect, but for someone like me, who likes creating awesome parks without money limit, this game is for you. All it needs now is the complete release and refined building tools!Edit: Ok I will re-review this game. It has been ages since the last update rolled out, and the game is nowhere near ready for even a ""playable"" release. They did not refine any building tools nor the UI's. Extremely upset with this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ developer. Forget everything I said in my initial review, do yourself a favor, and go buy Planet Coaster. Worst game to spend my $20 money on. Ever.			"

								Theme Park Studio is a major step from RCT3 and NoLimits! A must have Theme Park building simulation tool. Aside from it being in early beta mode, it will grow on you like the previous games have! If you enjoy building and customizing your own parks, then this is what you need right here! If you have no skills in a modeling program, like sketchup, and always wanted to model, Theme Park Studio is a great tool designed for even the beginners of all ages! You can start from nothing in your park or use a preset of parks made from the developers. Also there are many presets of scenery such as trees, lighting, walls, and buildings.Yes, shops, stalls, and rides are in 'static' mode for now, but they will be functioning when the full release comes out. But to learn how to use your controls and how to maneuver your objects is a must at first. Once you get the hang of it, it will be a breeze from there. Working with what we've got now will be a great start until we get more updated material!Theme Park Studio all the way!			"

								I backed this 2 years ago and updates have contnued to come more and more slowly. I barely even know if they are going to support the game anymore. Save your money and go check out Parkitect or Planet Coaster, they clearly want to support and make games for people to play and have a very clear idea, direction, and program leader over their.I hate to even say all this because I was really excited for this game when I backed it. Unless they start doing some big updates and showing some serious support again, I have all but lost faith in this game.			"

												As it now comes out of early access I have to admit to a bit of Stockholm syndrome going on with this game. I like many others backed it on kickstarter before either RCTW, Planet Coaster or Parkitech were even announced and encouraged others to support it as well. At the time it was full or potential and looked promising. Even when it was confirmed the game would have no management aspects and would just be a park decorator it still looked like it would do that well. All that personal investment has made it hard to admit it doesn't live up to that potential and probably never will.  As it stands Planet Coaster has far exceeded it on that front before it was released. It's early days for Planet Coaster and as it stands the one criticism of it is the weak management sim... Which Theme Park Studio doesn't even have. As park decorators go the only advantage Theme Park Studio really has is it kind of has mod support. Which unfortunately doesn't stop every park looking like it's made out of models designed to be sold on the Unity asset store (and is something the planet coaster devs are looking into to boot).  As it stands, unless you already have the skills that could get you a job as a game developer and want theme park engine you can customise however you like without having to build your own, then the title's park builder aspect doesn't really have anything that makes it shine compared to it's current competition. A layman will get nothing out of it and there's not really content on the workshop to make up for it. If you are ""lucky"" there is possibly one or two real world rides you know and love that have been faithfully recreated, but odds are against it.   It does have some redeemable features worth mentioning. It has a walk in the park feature allowing you to stroll through the park as one of the guests and ride the rides, with things like go karts being steerable rather than just on rails. More significantly this feature has full VR support. A much in demand feature for everyone with a VR headset as this genre is pretty much a match in heaven for it. Also although the feature seems to be missing at launch, you could join a testing group that allowed you to experience these features in a multiplayer mode. So maybe that is still coming soon.  That said those features are about on par with other free VR sandboxes like AltSpace VR, just with a customisable theme park level. Which is to say it looks and feels clunky, low tech and experimental. Which is a shame.  A lot of work has been put into this game by the developer, who has tried hard to make it live up to it's crowdfunding promises, and congrats to them for doing so. I wouldn't say it's failed in that regard, but it has failed to live up to it's potential. This isn't a fault of low effort or aspiration. It's just an issue with timing and scale. The scope of the game is too large for it's budget and the original developers of theme park tycoon 3 coming along and making an AAA title to release along side it is kind of a death knell for it's marketability and thus continued development. This game should still be in Early Access... There is just no point. No one will buy it and funds will not come in for more to get done. Which is sad, because rough around the edges as it is, it's unique feature list means there's still some potential there... Until it is snuffed out by Planet Coaster's expansion packs.  At time of writing the game retails for $30. Can I recommend it for that price? No not really. It's probably a more cohesive experience than RCTW but that's no recommendation. If you want a theme park decorator you are better off going with Planet Coaster. If you want a rollercoaster VR title then NoLimits is a better experience. Theme Park Studio uniquely has some VR flat rides at time of writing and if the multiplayer feature was fully implemented at launch that would be another feather in it's cap... However, it's not impossible it's competitors will beat it to the punch there too.  I still hold out some hope that I might just ""maybe"" get a few hours of fun out of the title playing around in a custom park with some friends in VR, before said features are made obsolete by other titles. I also have no regrets given the small sum I paid to the developer to give them shot at things and make a start for their company. That said I should not have encouraged others to buy in and I don't recommend doing so now unless it's purely philanthropic.   This genre needs more competition. This title's existance may encourage better funded developers to implement it's unique features, so in that regard I'm glad I supported it in coming to be. But once those features are picked up by another title, this game sadly no longer competes.			"

								This game/simulator is UNbeliavable. For an early access game, this is impressive and has passed and exceeded by far my expectaions. I can't believe what this has come out to be. Here are the pros and cons:Pros-+AMAZING graphics+variety of roller coasters (more coming)+variety of flat rides (more coming)+terrain tools+lighting effects+EXTREMELY customizable pathways+fencing and sidewalk options on pathways+++EVERYTHING IS SCALABLE!!!+Surprisingly easy controls+oculus rift support+Lakes+Can ride rollercoasters in 1st and 3rd person+WELL worth the money+steam workshop-you can create and import items into you're park+many more-I could easily go on. and on, and onCons--Buggy controls-sometimes random fps drops-sometimes crashes randomly (save you're work!)-no ""undo button"" (would LOVE TO SEE THIS!)-No fullscreen-Always in windowed mode-Sound needs improvment. During the lifthill, it sounds like an airplane is about to take off...So, it comes down to the final question: Do I reccommend this game? HANDS DOWN YES!!! This is the BEST value for what you get and show them that you love this and tell them that you like what their doing by BUYING this game. If you don't have this game, you're missing out...seriously. I'd also suggest buying it from their kickstarter extension because it's a better value-that's what I did: http://funding.themeparkstudio.com/projects/theme-park-studio-3/Here is are some videos of me playing it:

Early Access Review
								I have been trying tp keep up wih this game to see how the game is progressing through its development stages and how the development team has been responding to the users and the issues they have been having while trying to run the software. I hope this review helps other make a educated decision on whether the game is worth purchasing. I am happy to report the following observations and my take on the game, even after playing for hours.TPS is a must have for any hardcore fan of the Theme Park/Rollercoaster genre. Not only does the game provide a very strong studio editor for creating your own customized realistic Park, it provides the user with a good educational value of roller coaster physics and 3D edited flat rides. You are only limited in this game by your own imagination. At first glance, the UI looks intimidating,  but the staff at Pantera Entertainment have helped users overcome that obstacle very quickly by providing a strong background of how to use documentation included in the game along with a host of how to videos covering everything from building coasters to landscaping your own park. With that said, understanding the UI can quickly become second nature and easily managed after a few times of use. The incorporated Steam Worshop also makes it easy to import custom scenery and rides into the game without leaving the game interface.The coaster builder will set well with RCT3 fans, as it employees some of the same techniques while adding the ability to easily manipulate the control of creating banked turns and twisted track with the help of track nodes, something that RCTW seems to also be incorporating with their spline based track editor.  The track editor also has more features than RCT3 and without a doubt is better suited towards this game giving the user the ability to manipulate the track in every way possible.Now with all that said, everyone needs to understand that this software is still in the early access program phase and that they may and probally will encounter bugs and crashes due to their computer hardware conflicts and not having updated drivers. But with that thought, I must also say from strong observation, that the development team is doing an excellent job of addressing those issues if the users will report the problems they are having in the forum threads. Most of the people who are complaining and rating bad reviews are those who won't give the team the time to work out the bugs and put out a completed product that is highly polished. I have been able to play the game on a Windows 7 machine that was not build as a high end gaming outfit, very sucessfully. And although I have encourted a crash or two, I can clearly see the power that this game has that can't be found in other theme park builder games on the market.Although the game does not concentrate on the financial management of your park, it still ranks among the top best in Theme Park building games to have for fanatics and should be included in anyone's library who enjoyed RCT3 and/or No Limits Roller Coaster Simulation and for those who are interested in creating a very realistic Theme Park. On a scale from 1 to 5, the game gets 4.5 stars for the power that it has to create any realistic park and for the backup support the team has put into the game and continues to provide for the fan base it has.  If it was not for the fact that the game is still development mode, it would carry 5 stars all the way. Bottom line, this game is highly recommended. So the only question to gamers who are interested in this game, is whether they want to participate in the early access build or whether they want to wait until the game is completely finished. I hope this review helps those who are on the fence deciding on what the game provides and has to offer in the form of Theme Park Simulation building.			"

								Hi all, i thought it would be time to just write a small review about TPS from my point of view.First of all i'm a huge fan of TPS from the beginning mainly because it is so different from all the others out there.TPS is for me the first simulation game in which i can truly create my idea's from scratch and bring them to life.I have been creating some flat rides already (Break Dance, Move It24 and Turbo Polyp) which i think look amazing and could bring them to life within TPS without having to know any difficult scripting language. For the casual player it is possible to just click and place these created objects as well and change all of them to your liking even without creating it yourself.TPS is the ultimate themepark simulator for me and even during this early access stage the possibilities are huge.Flatrides, Coasters, Theming, Particle Effects, Lights and the list goes on.I read many people saying it is too difficult to handle but in fact it is not. In TPS you can create any park in a simple to use way but yes you have very advanced features as well which might look more difficult too handle at first but these are not needed in the first place to create a great park. Once you start playing around you will quickly find that even the advanced features are easy to handle once you know how to use them. Every game or software package has a learning curve, it either be big or small. Even in the days of RCT you had to find your way in the game before you could use its full potential.Anyway TPS has come a long way already and with all the improvements already made and more to come i would definitily recommend this game to anyone who likes to create their own Ultimate Theme Parks. As a side note the graphics are just amazing in TPS, keep in mind to meet your computer and graphic card specs as most issues reported are related to not meeting these specs.Thumbs up and keep up the good work Pantera! Looking out for what is all coming next.Just an example of what is possible with Flat rides:

								Of all projects I've backed on Kickstarter (video game and/or board games)... this one I regret the most.  Will I ever get a physical copy of the game?  Why did I pay basically double of the Steam listed price?  So many questions still unanswered, 2 years after the Kickstarter started.About the actual state of the game... huge learning curve, not intuitive at all.  Enjoying Parkitect for it's retro feel and mod support, and looking forward to Planet Coaster for something with more visual wow.  Will likely never install this game again.			"

								This game is simply the best theme park game. The shear ammount of things you can do is huge. I played alot of rct3 and after a while i seen this game, and once that happened, the game wasnt released and i waited patiantly for the game to come out, and i bought it as soon as i possibly could before roller coasters were released. The game even without roller coasters is amazing, so if you buy this game, be sure to learn everything you can because there is a learning curve, but once you get passed that you will be impressed. This game isnt like rct3 where if you wanted to make a unique roller coaster with hills and loops exactly the way you wanted you couldnt. Now in this game if you want your drop to be so steep, you can. So if you want an amazing theme park game. This is your game.			"

								I purchased this game back in August 2014 and almost two years later there has been very little change. The UI is confusing, the path system is frustrating, and the overall presentation is very bland. I know this was never intended to be a full fledged game and more of a tool to design amusement parks, but that's not an excuse for the lack of progress the game has seen.What little I managed to build after a few frustrating hours gameplay was watered down by the dull and lifeless atmosphere. I really wanted to get into this game, but every time I've played I end up just craving something with a little more life to it. As the game stands right now, I can't recommend.UPDATE:Since release, I haven't even be able to launch the game. I was curious to see how the final product turned out, but I guess that will have to wait.			"

								TPS has a lot of potential (and it's starting to realise some of it which is great), just don't buy it with the wrong expectations.It's not like RCT or any other management sim. You will not be juggling happiness, hunger and money.It's a blank canvas that gives you a free hand to design and create almost any park you can imagine. It focuses almost entirely on the construction (and personal enjoyment) of the park. Visitors are merely there to add movement and life.Personally, I enjoy the no-pressure pace and chance to be creative when I want to unwind. If I'm in the mood for something with a challenge, this isn't the game to launch.If you've ever ""played"" No Limits, it's much closer in spirit to that than almost any other rollercoaster game, but with a whole lot more detail and flexibility.For me, definitely worth the purchase.

												Kickstarted this game, now i open it to a white screen. It was amazing to watch it grow, then someone at the company decided VR was the way to go, still tons of bugs that were never fixed but hey we have VR, and now that I have a brand new system, that makes it so I can play all my games with highest graphic, oh except this one that gives me a white screen i am again dissappointed. There seems to be no end in site for this product to ever be what they said it would be. Sad I really enjoyed it in its early stages. Bit off more than they could chew I guess.			"

												Very disappointed with the direction this 'game' went. It was supposed to be a full park simulator, similar to the RCT series or Planet Coaster. Instead, we ended up with a ride designer that looks like a park simulation game. Don't get me wrong, TPS looks fantastic, but it's only skin deep. Don't waste any money on this one, just go straight for Planet Coaster! That's the game that this genera as been waiting for since RCT 2!BTW, I have way more than 1 hour in this game, probably closer to 20 or so. I would screw with it after hours at work, which is frequently offline after a certain time.			"

								I purchased this on Kickstarter, a T-shirt they promised me, vegetation designer (I don't know what I was thinking) Platinum edition box delivered to me and other things. It took like a year for them to even add me to the wall of backers (Thanks) and once I seen that they wasn't going anywhere I asked for my money back, they told me that only Steam could do that.After many, many headakes Steam told me to go back and talk to TPS dev's about it, then the TPS dev (I wont mention names) Said they it's too late and they have already used all the money and put it back into development.EVERYTHING is just horrible in this ""Tool"" even making paths is horrible, it's just a broken tool, game, simulator or whatever else you want to call this.I WANT MY MONEY BACK! Just go buy Planet Coaster if you want to play a Theme Park game with a fun way to build coasters or buy No Limits 2 for a fantastic Roller Coaster builder simulator.10/10 would rather lick battery acid than play this again.

								Even though this game is in it's very early stages, this game has grabbed my attention.  If you like to build, if you like to design your own rides from scratch (literally from scratch), and design your park in this huge map - if you love to give detail to your design, then Theme Park Studio is for you.  Like I said, even though this game is in it's very early stages, there are so much to get your started, and to grab your attention.  I found that the developers of TPS will listen to their customers about issues they find, or take consideratioin of their ideas - which I think is fantastic.  I even conversed with them on Facebook.  Every so often they will release move of the game in phases.   So if you like to create your own theme park from scratch, and really get into the designing of the rides, then Theme Park Studios is for you.			"

								One of the greatest Games ever was and still is the RollerCoaster Tycoon Trilogy.RCT3 banned me on my PC because I really love RollerCoasters of all Kind.To build them and to take a ride on my creations (since RCT3) was great!BUT RCT was yesterday, TODAY is ""Theme Park Studio"" from Pantera Entertainment!TPS is a Early Access Game that means the Game isn't finished yet and it also means that you don't have to wait till Full Release (which will cost more than now), you can buy it right now and play it and if you want, help the developers to make it better and better!The whole Set of Tools is really powerful you will seek for that in thousand other games but you will not find them!!! Some are very easy and some are more advanced!The WorldTool is great. Build your world with Brushes and paste everything on it (Trees, bushes, flowers) you can also search for a heightmap and load it into TPS! With one click you have the ""ground"" of (maybe) Europe or Africa or just a little part of our World you can ""play"" with!Build Paths and let them go thru your Park like a silly snake! And STOP the Path with just hitting ESC! Make your path small or wide, let trees, benches, lanterns etc. be added automaticly!Build finished Flat-Rides or build your own with different kind of shapes and let this shapes rotate, move and so on with powerful animation Tools!Build COASTERS!!!The Coaster-Editor is really awesome! Choose your Coastertype and start to build the craziest Coaster ever! My personal favorites since the finishing of the complete Phase 3 is the Mine Train and the Wooden Coasters!!!Every part you set into your world can be moved, resized, rotated and saved for later needs in your librarys!Let your library grow and grow and build YOUR ultimate Theme Park that you ever wanted to have!The ONLY thing that is NOT possible in your Park is BECAUSE YOU did't imagine that!People with the biggest imagination (or craziest) will have the best Parks :)Everything you need to do is to back up those Guys at Pantera Entertainment directly on Steam or give them back up on kickstarter (where you have more options on being part of this Project and also to get the Platinum Edition)Belive me: You will say: EVERY cent I paid for it is worth!PLAY THIS GAME!!! OR BETTER - BUILD THIS GAME!!!(Sorry for my english but I am living in Germany, so if you find spelling mistakes you can have them, put them in your pocket and save them for poor times :) )			"

								I have now been working with Theme Park Studio for a really long time and I have to tell you, it is without a doubt the BEST theme park creation software out there. No other software short of a 3D animation powerhouse like Maya or Modo can do what TPS can.It's obvious that the creator of this software has put sweat, blood and tears into this software and it shows. The coasters are amazing, fun to build and incredible to ride. It's amazing how TPS just automatically adds and adjusts the coaster's supports in response to lifting or lowering track pieces. Node editing is intuitive and fun. You can really get in there and make it perfect by using the node editor and editing by the numbers. It's insanely easy to add batwings, loops, corkscrews and plenty of other amazing inversions and specialty pieces. Lastly, I love how TPS can auto-close the coaster track. You can color or texture anything anyway you want. It has plenty of coaster types (all the major ones), like winged, steel, inverted, wood, mine train, etc) and you can customize the coaster any way you want. Finally, you can add custom scenery to your parks. I've added rocks, buildings and tunnels for the coasters to go by and through - amazing!The path editing is amazing. I love how terrain automatically adjusts itself when you raise or lower a path. It's also great that the path's struts, bridges, etc all adjust themselves in realtime. You can put foliage, sidewalks and other things inside and outside paths. You can create traffic circles, junctions and more. Very, very complete path editor.The flat rides that come with it are so real! The physics are spot on and you can ride all of them. With Bumper Cars and Boats coming - and Go Karts! - I just think Theme Park Studio is one hell of a good deal and simply cannot be beat in the theme park creation arena.It has particles (think fireworks, snow, fire, etc) and full editing and creation of just about anything (you can make buildings, rides, etc).You can enter the park and it has peeps that ride the rides with you (kids and adults). There is so much to this software that it's almost impossible to mention everything it can do. If it's THIS amazing in early access, I can't imagine how good it will be when fully released!No doubt about it - after logging in tons of hours with Theme Park Studio, i've never been so excited about a piece of software. It just keeps getting better and better.- Karmacomposer			"

								Imagineering is finally available on your home computer! Here is a game that acknowledges that people will make DIsney style parks and is specifically designed to allow players to do just that. Let your crreative be held back no longer by the limits of previous games.(Review Update 5/14/14)Phase 2:I have just tested the new Phase 2 update and I must say that the animation module is by far the best animation module for any theme park game. And it's only just getting started! The animated flat rides look very smooth and move in a believable, life-like fashion. They appear to abide by real world physics and they act as real flat rides do. Now, the models to the rides might get updates to detail which would be nice, but this update is all about the animation and it is VERY real. Couldn't do Tower of Terror in RCT3? Well now you can in Theme Park Studio! Want to make Falcon's Fury? Now you can! Want to make an S&S power tower? WELL NOW YOU CAN! Finally, a game that allows freedom and flexibility. When you really look at it, this game has true potential that other coaster related games do not offer. And you can suggest ideas on the forums and know that Pantera will actually listen! Theme Park Studio is only getting better and I look forward to seeing where it will go next. Coaster enthusiasts, future Imagineers or ride designers - this game is the perfect game for you!			"

								If your idea of a Theme park game is mainly focused around how much profit your park makes then Theme Park Studios probably isn’t the game for you. If on the other hand you see yourself as a very creative person who like to let their imagination run wild then you have come to the right place, Theme Park Studios will be one of you best buys. Theme Park Studios isn’t even finished yet and it’s pretty amazing already.Once you get started and get used to the control system, which to be honest are pretty simple, then you can start to create you dream park with almost no limit in terms of creativity. Everything has its own menu and is simple to use, you can even import your own 3D objects with no fuss at all. You don’t have to know any form of code.If you think this is the game for you keep in mind that it’s not completely finished yet and you can help test it. If that appeals to you then go for it.

								For those of you debating whether or not to get Theme Park Studio, here are the pros and cons.Cons:Most features are currently missing, and at present you can only desing your parkBuggy, very very buggyDefinite Learning CurveYou will be purchasing an unfinished game not to play, but to testPros:There is really only one pro, one that makes this game entirely worthwhile: it's potential.  The game's potential lies not in that it can be a great game if all goes well, but instead that by purchasing this game early and giving input to the developer this game has high potential to be the game YOU want it to be.  For $30, you have the ability to dream up your ideal theme park game, without having to do any of the work building it.  While yes, technically you are not purchasing a game you will get immediate enjoyment from, you still are making a wise decision in buying this game.  It's like an investment: you are paying money, and after a period of time, you are getting far more than your money's worth, because instead of ending up with a good game with things you want, you will have exactly what you want turned into a game, with little to no compromise.

								TPS is a great game which has given me hours of fun since EA released.I was a kickstarter backer way back when the game was first announced. The concept is/was excellent, custom theme park design in an easy to use interface. This isn't RCT, it is much more detailed. It has many more features which cater to people who enjoy building and designing rides and theme parks. It does not, however  have vomit and peep bowling. So if that's your thing...Right now, phases 1, 2, and 6 have been released.The feature set isn't finished at the moment, but there is still plenty to do. Custom flat ride creation is made easy with the built in keyframer and physics engine. Many people have already designed their own rides from scratch, I'm not that handy with modeling, but I've made several ""franken flats"" with the built in pieces. The keyframer also makes custom animatronics easy. Buildings, rides, paths, scenery, etc. are all easy in TPS. Take a look through the screenshots page to see some of the amazing things people are making. It is an amazing tool.I recommend TPS to anybody. If you enjoy designing rides, coasters, or theme parks, this is the best program to do it IMO. It dives into much greater detail than the RCT series without any added difficulty.			"

								As a Roller Coaster Fan I really like Theme Park Studio. I'M currently creating my buildings, which I want to use in blender and it is very easy to import this creations into TPS. Of course you have to take some topics into acount, but when you have imported this models, it is fantastic to walk through this models and watch them from all sides.As this ""walking"" in blender is not possible in a real time walk, I'm wondering how TPS could do this. Great work! It is also very easy to build your roller couster around this buildings and to drive with this coaster and to see the fantastic world you built by your own. Of course TPS is currently not ready and there are still much things to do, but it is great to see the game growing with every release. The community is really helpful and I like to share my models within the workshop. For me it is essential, to start already know and I thank the developer for that, because creating realistic buildings needs time. This is exactly the time I need to create my building and to learn in parallel the usage of Theme Park Studio. When TPS is then ready for release, I hope, that my buildings are also ready, to easily add them to my park and walk virtually through it.But please don't expect a game which is already finalized. It is currently not. Take the advantage to include your ideas and be part of the creation of this game. I think it is really worht the time!Best regards  Mikesch8764			"

								If you're looking for a complete game DONT BUY!!!! But if you're looking to participate in an early-access ""test"" to help make this the leading next-gen theme park editor then by all means please buy it! From what i've seen in the videos and in-game, it looks like this game has massive potential and firmly believe that it will be a success. Gameplay is VERY limited at this state, however it is in it's very first stages of public testing and with time more features will be added. As of now all you can do is create buildings, paths, terraform, some scenary, and place non animated flat rides. I am looking forward to the new updates and have no problem waiting as i am aware that early access is a waiting game, and if you are not aware then leave this page and come back in a year or so. All in all:-has potential to be the BEST theme park creator out there-still in early-access so not many features-controls and interface easy to use-NOT RCT! -have unlimited freedom in placement of objects-great graphics, lights,and shading-worth the money if you understand the true meaning of early-access <<<<<<<< VERY IMPORTANT >>>>>>>>			"

The game is in early release, so do not expect a completed game at this time.  The developers are working hard to add new features and the coasters are coming out soon.  If you've always dreamed of creating your own theme park, with few restrictions, outstanding graphics, and easy to use controls, this is your game.			"

								pretty fun making a coaster so far.. the game needs a colision marker have parts of the coaster track go red if its trying to go thru other parts though. its hard to find where some parts of the coaster go's threw polls or other bits of the track. if that part of the track went red people would know to tweek it move it around a bit. so theres no colision or going threw other objects.. good work so far to the team though.

												I tried to play this several times but I just couldn't get into it.  It seems like if you had lots of time to master the pathing system and other play mechanics it might be fun, but for me I just didn't have any fun playing the game.  I stuggled to do seemly simple things.  I also don't really see why it's called theme park because most of the buildings are very generic and bland.  I didn't really see a way to create a horror theme or a sci/fi , adventure, wild west, etc..  One of other things is dark rides and water rides with themes, everything seemed very bland.  I kept waiting for this game to get better, but it just never did, and seemed to fail on what it promised.			"

								Theme Park Studio will be the hottest theme park product for some time to come. It has features not found in any game/simulator of its kind! It rivals RCT by leaps and bounds. The early access is really great, as I can try each phase and learn how to use it before the next. Pantera the developer has gone way beyond any developer in the field of amusement park design with this great product. They have put 100% effort and work into this product.I have had the pleasure to use the phase 2 and 6 for a while now and to be honest here,,,it's amazing! The things that will be possible with this product  will knock your feet off.I took parts from other rides (seats, beams, towers ) and twisted them up, down, forward, backward all to create a wild flat ride, and you can literally spin,twist,pivot, bounce any thing anyway you can think of. Words just can't describe how amazing this product is.I recommend Theme Park Studio for anyone who wants to build the ultimate theme park. "

												No,  no its not. I bought this early acces a year or so ago.  I knew it would be the all time answer to an amusement park building system.   A year later,  the only real improvement is the VR which was easy from a developer standpoint.  They say all the improvements are ""under the hood"".  Im a programmer and find this difficult to beleave.  Opinions aside,  The game has been stagent for a year save the VR,  Instuctions are very scarce,  physics to objects is very buggy,  You cannot MAKE new coaster cars you can only texture the existitng ones. I could go on. WOW this could have been a great game and it may still be in 4 or 5 years.  BTW they have reinstantiated the kickstart somehow. It seems to me(opinion)  That they have lost interest in everything but the currency influx.  Maybe they lost a lot ot team members, I dunno.  im not going to tell you not to buy but I will tell you do not assume.  Ok you trolls can start in now.			"

												I purchased Theme Park Studio during the Early Access days when it first came out. I was excited about the game just like many other people were. Then after I got the game I was left with frustration, disappointment and a little bit of hope that the game would turn into something more than what I saw and was able to do. Now I understand with certain Early Access games you can't do much, it's in developement and they are kind of testing to see what people like and don't like. So I waited for more updates to give it a fair chance. After I heard it might be released on Steam, I started the game up to only find not much has changed. Now don't get me wrong, there are some things I do like about the game. But there were more cons then pros for me when I tried to play the game. This game had so much potential and hopefully in the future there will be updates to fix these issues. Based on my own playing experience I cannot recommend this game.			"

The game does sometimes stop for about a miniute when I try to make a custom coaster train but I understand that the game is still early in development which is why it is early-acces. Overall it is a great game. I do realy want to see water rides in new updates because it will make some parks so much better (not that they are bad). 9/10 :D			"

								As a major roller coaster tycoon fan I had to give this a try. The first thing that struck me was how much customization you can give your coasters over RCT. Gone is the grid of RCT! With TPS you can freestyle your coasters any way you want to. I'm excited to see more re-creations of real world rides on the workshop.  Right now (phase 4) there's many coasters to choose from that you can build such as wooden and steel. I haven't really touched onto the scenary and flat rides however, so I'm not sure how they are, but I've heard good things about the customization of those. Pros:-Easy to use interface-Lots of customization-Workshop integration-Build amusement parks!Cons:-None really, just be sure you know your purchasing a early access game. I bought this game for $15 on sale during the winter sale. Not sure if it'd be worth $30 at its current state though. 9/10! I recommend buying it when it goes on sale. "

								The game is great, in concept, however it has a long way to go to be worth the $30. Understanding that it is only in Phase 2 of development, I am ok with not all of the content having been released yet (coasters), however it is in massive need of improvement on general use and the overall experience. Doing even the simplest of tasks is confusing and requires extensive YouTube research to be able to figure out. Some minor to severe glitching issues, which can be expected, but can make an already frustrating endeavor even worse when you spend hours getting something right, only to have it dissapear or moved accientally. Building a decent park would likely take as long as building one in real life. Having already purchased the game, I am anxious to see how it develops. especially once Phase 3 is rolled out. If given the option now after demo-ing the game for a few hours, I would hold off on the purchase or forgo it all together.			"

								Hi Guys,As a Theme Park Studio Backer, I have played the game for many hours with great pleasure.I'm a park builder, and time can fly when I get stuck into placing paths, trees, rides and food courts.At the beginning there were lots of headaches trying to learn how to use the phases as they werereleased, but having the developer work with us to iron out the bugs made it way easier.They have been very helpful in resolving issues and have worked closely with the community!With theme park studio, you can build any theme park you want from large to small, Street fairs,carnivals and anything in between.Tools within the game are very powerful although not complicated, they are ideal for beginner, intermediate and advanced players. Building and re-colouring structures is really easy with the wall sets that are included in-game and more will be added as TPS evolves and of course we have the UGC from steam workshop too!If you have a flair for design and use external 3-D packages you can create complex stalls, coaster stations, houses and other types of buildings, basically anything you like.With the powerful built in animation features you can take a ride or structure that you have created in an external package and animate it within the game.Theme park studio has a whole set of tools in a sandbox environment where you can let your imagination run wild.There are lots of theme park games coming to the market, but none are as flexible as TPS!The reasons for this is that TPS is aimed at the imagineer, who wants to create what ever they want without limits.To me, TPS is in a similar vein to NoLimits, except coaster building is simplified but also powerful and you are able to build complete parks with guests.Check out the forums for info on the developement of TPS, there is way more to come and you'll enjoy using it.

								For people who loved playing RCT3 in the past. This game beats it in so many ways. It runs really well and the game can handle more stuff in your park than in other rollercoaster park games before.For players who like to create and import their own 3d models into the game. This game cuts the process of importing by a very large amount. It is as simple as exporting the model and importing it into the game. Much hassle by a long shot.The game is still in development, but with each new phase, highly requested and relevent options are given to the players to make their park more lively.Sadly there isn't any ""peeps"" yet so your park looks rather deserted till they finally implement it.The coaster creation system feels new and may take just a little to get used to how it works, but after an hour or so of messing with the options it will feel like second nature.Overall I give the game an 8/10. It still needs improvement and I do find bugs once in awhile, but I logged around 100 hours and enjoy being creative.Here is a picture of my recreation of Disneyland, CA that I have been working on. Almost everything is my own CS and the game has yet to slow down at all. Very well optimized to handle these thingshttp://imgur.com/4YNUv1xYou can check out plenty of pictures of full coaster action on their main site. "

								Theme Park Studio is NOT a game but a very POWERFUL tool to creating theme parks.  If you ever want to have full control in desinging your own theme park then this is the program for you.  I will not list everything it can do but I will say this it fully allows you to create your own roller coasters and flat rides as well as other stuff.    If there isn't enough selection you can use any 3D program that can export in the 3ds format.  Right now it is in the beta stages.  For those who still don't know what beta is its still in design or an excellent idea that is slowly growing that's becoming better and better.  The newest addition thats going on is enjoying other peoples theme parks live.  This will be extremely interesting.  Keep in mind that this is a tool and the only thing going for it is the power of creating your own parks.  So if you are the one that has always want to build your own theme park then this is the program for you but if you want to experience the business side of it as well then go play the others but you will have very limmited construction abilities in those types of games.  As far as I know Theme Park Studio is the only TRUE designer of theme parks.  So please support PanteraEnt and if you wait you'll be missing out so much.			"

Because it's a more sophisticated system than RCT3, it takes some getting used to. But if you've played RCT3, you already have a minor head start. I'm just glad that I can build anything I want now, without worrying about the puzzle-piece mechanics of RCT3.			"

The potential for awesomeness is definitely here, and I can't wait for more sections of the game to be released, and to see what the incredibly talented community forming around this game can produce as well.TL:DR- Get this is you don't mind learning a game (not just pick up and play) and love making amusement parks and thought RCT is too cartoony.

								This game has ALOT of potential, and is a great simulator so far. Im not too far into it, but i think i got enough of the games concept to make a basic, fair judgement. First off, for some reason, this game is lagging for me. My computer isn't great, but i can play almost any game on regular settings and run 25-40 FPS. This game (since its in alfa im guessing), is a little laggy. But past the slowness is a beautiful, spectacular game (Simulation). The brand new custom flat ride designer and animator looks complicated concept, but i bet its easier than it looks. All in all, this is probally gonna knock RCT3 outta the park, although these things would be cool to see:1. Money/ Economy2. Fix lag issues3. Multiplayer? (You and friends being able to play as a guest(s) on the same park)4. WorkshopSorry for the long review, hope it helps anyone looking to buy it!Score- 8/10 (In Alfa state WITHOUT coasters)			"

They already have an insane amount of customization, the landscape is beautiful, graphics are completely modern and amazing, and its only v0.04, seriously, if they have done this much with a ""pre phase"" the possibilities are endless, nevertheless, when they finally release the full version, it will be nothing like any other simulation game. On top of all of that, for a cheap price of $30, no one should be complaining, and if you are, then you have absolutely no idea what TPS is about. The developers have been so kind personally, I've contacted them multiple times for things, and they have responded with tons of care. This game is one to watch, because once we start getting through the phases, it's going to be insane.			"

												Im sorry but this game is disapointing. Why cant they fix the crashes before working on VR? I mean its not even a playable game half the time, an I'm running a pretty good system. They realeased ""Major flat ride update"" But for the life of me WHY CANT THEY JUST MAKE A PLAYABLE THEMEPARK STUDIO???????? Sure, sometimes it works, but other times it just doenst do it. I mean hell, no limits 1 was better than this. DO NOT BUY! At least until this developer listens to their customers.			"

												Do not waste your time/money. Dev support is a joke, I honestly thought they gave up on this game a long time ago only to have it come out of early access just to compete with Planet Coaster. It is very unfinished/unstable and I'm not even going to try the Vive VR mode for this very reason. It sucks that I've spent so much time giving this game a chance and I hope others are not duped into supporting this incomplete product.			"

								Let me start by saying I backed this game when It was on kickstarter. It was the first project I ever backed. I had 100% confidence in the developer that they would make a spectacular game that was a new and reimagined version of Roller Coaster Tycoon, and I knew it would be spectacular. When the time finally came, after two long years, and the game released, I was blown away.....Blown away at how glitchy, empty, boring, and difficult to play the game was. I thought, ""Well, I won't give up, I'll just check every now and then to see if they fix stuff."" Here I am, another 2 years later, and the game has more content, sure, but it doesn't really matter. The ""game"" itself is still glitchy, boring, and difficult to accomplish anything with. Trying to do the simplest task of creating a path can quickly turn into a multihour ordeal. This game is infuriatingly unresponsive and just straight bland. I put quotes around game because it's not a game, it's a creation tool. I can see MAYBE for some coaster designers to enjoy this game. If they successfuly fight against the controls and the sad excuse for UI, it's very technical and the physics system is very good, but for the average consumer, this is absolutely not good. This game is just pure and simple, not fun to play. I had alot of hope, and alot of confidence that this game would be something great, but in it's current state, and i'd imagine until they decide to dump the project altogether, it is just plain bad. If they advertise this as a commercial product, and they remove everything except for the coasters, and maybe foliage, I think they'll be back in business. Focus all efforts on the coasters, and push this towards the engineering companies. Then this game will succeed. Right now, this is not a good game, and it's barely even a game in general.			"

								Theme Park Studio is a breath of fresh air in the theme park simulation genre. This genre, which has suffered a severe drought since the release of Roller Coaster Tycoon 3, is finally being revitalized thanks to Pantera Entertainment. Everything about the game blows me away. The physics on the ride are incredible (My stomach sank just from watching the S&S drop tower operate. It's just like the real thing: terrifying), the scenary is virtually limitless thanks to the easy-to-use importer, and the soon to be released coaster module looks like it'll be incredible as well. I can't wait to build replicas of coasters like the Millenium Force or The Beast and ride them over and over and over again.Now it's important to note that I said, ""Soon to be released"". This game is still in Early Access. Some of the features shown in promotional videos are still being tweaked and perfected behind the scenes by the good people at Pantera. It's important to remember this. Too many people purchase Early Access games expecting them to be completed experiences. If the game was finished, it wouldn't be early access!From a graphics standpoint, the game is a major leap from previous theme park simulation titles. It discards the stylized, cartoon-like rides of the Roller Coaster Tycoon series in favor of a more realistic approach, and TPS nails it. That being said, if I wanted to make a stylized ride, nothing is holding me back from doing so. The tools included in TPS let the player piece together their own ride using prefab parts or lets them import their own parts for use in-game.A good way to think of Theme Park Studio is that it's the Gary's Mod of theme park simulation games. It provides a great deal of content out of the box, but it's so open-ended you can do just about anything you want in it. Once all of the phases are released, this game will almost certainly do down as a classic for sim players.			"

								After trying this ""game"" a little bit more. I have to say the last updates were very positive! I used to crash every time i open the game and wasnt able to b=place anything and edit it as i wanted, the roads were so akward to work with... Now, they improved a LOT! You can really control the roads, the buildings now auto face the roads, you can choose how precise you wanna put your buildings from each other and the controls are WAY easier to use! THANK YOU for that! That is awesome. I am now able to do SOMETHING in there and i didnt crash do far! This game is really more a building type game right now. I still have to figure out lots of things in it but if i have to rate it since last year to now, it totally improved and the developpers are really listening to what players wish to see in there. What I am expecting from this game is really to have LOTS of control on the building part or it, and then have the RCT playable part to it as well. I wanna be able to build my park and then have some sandbox and/or campaign as well.			"

								This is a great sandbox type game to build theme parks and roller coasters.  If you are looking for a gaming aspect like management similar to RCT then you are going to be dissapointed.   The freedom to build in TPS is amazing compared to being stuck within the grid system of RCT.  The coaster editor is superior to RCT.  Custom content will be what makes this game spectacular as more players start contributing their own creations to the community.  There is a learning curve to this game so don't expect to master it in an hour.  Now there is the LIVE aspect of visiting other players parks with other players just like a live virtual theme park!  Be patient and once you can learn everything thing this theme park builder can do you are going to enjoy it.			"

								I love this simulation in so many ways, don't get me wrong. I love the rides(thank goodness for the Ride Library updates; excited to check out the new stuff that' come since my last play in October! I (mostly) like the coaster builder (at times, but it can be seriously glitchy if you don't hit the snap point right; check out my snapshot of a piece of track the game made after I mis-clicked onto the path instead of the piece of track), and the peep system isn't too bad; they look realistic, and their AI isn't the best, but it's the best we have for now, at least until Planet Coaster comes out. No use in hoping for RCTWorld to be saved, because 1) Atari is still in charge of making it, 2) the game's developer has changed 6(?) times, and 3) while it looks bucket loads better than it did when the initial gameplay trailr came out, I'm not sold on the product because I made that horrible mistake with Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs and Everybody's Gone to the Rapture. Anyways, let's get on with the greatness of this simulation.     1) Paths-Path system is a hell of a lot better than it was, at least for my unobservant self.-Everything is a LOT EASIER to connect, delete, and change around-Paths actually look good while functioning at top quality at the same time, which is rare for these types of game it seems. :P-Paths are nowhere near as bad as I made them seem in my negative review before! :)     2) Building Crap-Still a bit ""meh"" every once in a while when it comes to resizing, but overall the system is nice-Benches are a TON easier to actually place on TOP OF the pathways; before the simulation loved to just place them on the ground and pretend no path was even there-Lamps and whatnot are easier to rotate, and the system as a whole is a lot better and much easier to learn than it was before     3) Coaster Builder-Top notch customization, although connecting tracks at the end can be kind of hard-So much better than RCTWorld's coaster builder will ever become-Typically lagless, unless you place something wrong, and you KNOW when you have hit the wrong button or done something bad. xD     4) Ride Library-Very impressive rides in a pretty massive selection compared to what I expected-Great deal of customization; you can even make your OWN rides!-Incredibly easy to rotate, place, customize, and control; no question from me (a first xD)     5) Effects and Environment-Effects are sorta basic, but can add a lot to your park-Environmental features are THE BEST so far. Suck on that, NoLimts 2! :D-Customize everything from effects color and type, to height, start and end, and with environment, everything from the skybox, to the weather and sun/moon position     FINAL REFLECTION-Amazing simulation; by far the best product on the market, but we'll see when Planet Coaster comes out. :P-Everything is done so well in this game, it's crazy! No wonder why it took so long for most of the stages to come out. :3-Everything is fully customizable(except the entrance?), and can be changed in terms of color, size, and many, MANY MORE options!     OVERALL RATING: 9/10 Good job Pantera Entertainment! You learned from that...other coaster game you made a long time ago. :D			"

								Theme Park Studio is a platform for coaster designers to build 3D prototypes that hides behind the facade of being a game.Placement of flat rides, scenery and foliage are easy to use, although having to place an item on the ground without the ability to rotate before placement makes this simple task tedious.  Path placement is very rough as well.  I have difficulty connecting paths to each other and to ride entrances, as the path system is on a ""node system"".  Again, placing paths in a theme park should be one of the least tedious of tasks, but Theme Park Studio seems to lack funciontality and usability in these aspects.Custom rollercoaster design is the most user-friendly aspect of the theme park designer console.  The ""node system"" really works here, as compared to the pathing system, where you can pull and raise individual nodes to tweak a coaster during or after it has been completed.  I found the coaster designer extremely gratifying, being able to create more realistic banks, drops and turns that I was not able to with previous theme park designer games in the past decade.What I consider a game and why I do not consider Theme Park Studio to be a game is the lack of scenarios, lack of micromanagement, and employees.  This is truly a console to showcase ride designs, not for simulating you being the 'owner' of a theme park.  I feel the launch of VR support is a nice addition, but falls flat due to the lifeless look each park has as you walk around.In short, if you want a designer console that is easier to use than what coaster engineers use, give Theme Park Studio a go.  If you are looking to simulate your own theme park, look elsewhere.			"

								There is so much to like about this Theme Park simulator.  It is such a powerful tool that allows you to create so many aspects of a fun park… from the paths to vegetation, flat rides, buildings, landscapes & of course roller coasters.  If you can imagine it, there’s a good chance you can create it!  If you don’t want to create it then download the community created items, simple!As it is a powerful program there is a lot to learn but I found it a bit easier by choosing one aspect to learn at a time e.g. path building one day & building coasters the next (and yes you can ride your coasters).  A lot of it (for me) felt quite intuitive & there are manuals & videos covering all the main topics.  The community is also very friendly & are always willing to help.One of the things I have really enjoyed about the Theme Park Studio project is seeing the developers implementing many of the suggestions that the community have given… they are really listening.  And as it is still in development there’s still time to add some of your own ideas through the forums on Steam or the forums on the Theme Park Studio website.I’m really looking forward to the future phases being released, in particular the peeps!  Can’t wait to see them entering the park & riding my coasters.			"

								Theme Park Studio is an incredibly powerful tool that is unique in the theme park game arena.  It allows you to create realistic, lifelike parks compared to the cartoon-like look that most other games are going for currently. It allows almost limitless flexiblity for your creations, particularly if you are familiar with 3d modeling.  Even if you're not, there's so much content in the Steam Workshop for inserting in your park as-is. Like many powerful tools, it does take some patience to fully understand and utilize.  But when it comes together there are some really incredible moments in the parks you make for yourself.What it isn't: TPS is not designed to be a Roller Coaster Tycoon type experience with money and personnel management.  Bottom line: If you're willing to invest a little time learning it, TPS is the best piece of software out there for creating a full park experience!			"

This game is all about designing a theme park. Not about running one. That means that in TPS (Theme Park Studio) you don't have to care about money. As I said this is a game to design your own themepark. In TPS you will be able to install/make custom content (Scenery, Rides, Textures, Height maps and much more). Using this custom content you (almost) have no limitations to your imagination. A great feature that makes this game different from other theme park related games is the fact that you're able to work with or without a grid. This allows for more natural looking parks instead of having everything line up with each other.Let's talk about some stuff I really like about this game (Those are more opinion based).The path system in this game is nice because you're able to make curved paths without having to download custom content. This also brings some problems (Those things might be fixed in future updates). Building a Y formed path may be hard sometimes. Currently (18-3-2014) you've got to be very creative to come up with solution to prevent strange side walks. But I'm sure this will be fixed.Graphics are something I just love about this game. Having the ability to use high poly models without to much problems really is a thing I like. Also textures look really nice because of normal mapping (Mini 3D details that aren't actually 3D).After all I really like this game and I'm excited to see what Pantera will bring us in upcoming updates!

Early Access Review
								Theme park Studio certainly deserves a Thumb’s UP.So first of i have been aware of this game since the announcement before Kickstarter and as a fan i now get to see TPS and finally play it. From the start this feels more of a Tool then a game, but a great one at that, THEMEPARK STUDIO is a sandbox theme park building simulator with impressive features such as object, lights , scenery and the terrain feature which is unbelievable its extremely easy to use from beginning and from this you can create fantastic vista and scenery at a press of a button.Every time I play this I learn more and more and I become more confident towards creating new objects and scenery,And this is only the beginning for this tool, there are many more phases that Panera entertainment want to implement and you can see the amount of care and attention have gone towards this it certainly puts a huge smile on my face and at the end of the journey the vastness of content will be  out standing and this will be great for new comers.People should understand this is early access this is no way near the Finshed Product i'm here to help them and give my input towards Theme park studio. The more people that buy this the better community involvement and from this pantera know what features to fix, Patch, update or even implement new features It seems unfair to the Dev’s especially the comments they have received it seems some people still don't understand what Early Access actually is. If you’re expected a Whole 100% game then early access is not for you and you should wait however if you want to join Pantera entertainment and go with them on a  Journey and see how this Tool Develops with in time then you should Jump aboard,This is a Ride I wont forget !

								It's been a long time coming, but finally the next generation of theme park building software is almost upon us. For all those who have been dreaming of the day, when you can finally build the theme park of your dreams without any restrictions, this is something to really get excited about.Pantera Entertainment have listen to every suggestion, listened to all the feedback, and are creating something with a real ability to satisfy the Theme park builder in almost every one of us.Customize your landscape, and even the environmental settings.Choose from what will eventually be a huge catalogue of rides, rollercoasters, shops, buildings, trees and bushes. And for those who want to go that step further, create your own and import them with a minimum of hassle.The community aspect is also going to be something that keeps this title alive and fresh for many years to come, with people making their creations available to visit, and share all kinds of various items to add to your own parks.If you loved RCT3, spent hours upon hours in the sandbox but felt really limited, then this is the game for you. If however you only enjoyed RCT3 for the money management challenges and the ability to kill peeps, then this title may be a bit too serious for you.			"

								Been following this game for some time. This is one of those ""games"" where the developer bit off more than they could chew, and took too long to updateso now there are deeper options when it comes to games in this genre. Like someone said before, the controls are clunky and the parks are just not pretty to look at. Add to it that there really is no management aspect to this,its just another dud. Also, the steam forum moderator removes any and all signs of even mildcriticism or suggestion posts. Go ahead, try to find one. -10/10			"

Early Access Review
								First off, this is an early access beta. I bought it because it's Oculus Rift DK2 compatible. Despite my rating, I say do not buy it yet unless you're interested in providing feedback for the beta and don't mind dealing with an incomplete and very buggy game. It's got issues, big ones.It's extremely unstable. It's crashed several times and I had to verify file integrity twice because crashes corrupted the defaut demo parks. Took me the better part of an hour and a half to get it to work well enough to test out one of the coasters. I downloaded the coaster of the month from the Workshop for this because there isn't much to the demo parks that come with it by default.It loads slow as well and has a tendency to get to the edge of crashing during a load. I've found the best thing to do is sit back and not touch anything while it's loading. A few of the windows and taskbars will go white while it's loading, but after a few moments it finishes and everything ran fine for the most part. My crashes were mostly related to loading errors and Alt-Tab, the game does not like Alt-Tab and has a nasty tendency to freeze if you do. Once everything was loaded it didn't give me any trouble so far, but still remember to save often if you're building something because I wouldn't trust it to not crash while I was building after a while right now.The only rides you can test are the roller coasters. Hoping that will change in the future. The coasters are cool, but it'd be nice to have a go at anything in the park you can build, including the flat rides. Still worth it for only the coasters, but I'm hoping there will be more to it than that later on.I got stuck a couple of times in some of the scenery when walking about. Not a huge deal, just hit the ticket icon to teleport back to the entrance. Not really a big problem, but it does happen on occasion. It also very badly needs a mouselook button. A lot of the rides and scenery is very tall, but as far as I can tell you can only look about at ground level and can't look up at anything when roaming the park in first person.DK2 support needs work. The view doesn't twist or turn with the ride and simply remains level while rising and falling with the height of the ride and never twiting or inverting with the track. Also, positional tracking for leaning forward and back is reversed, leaning forward makes the player move back rather than forward. That might work for a very basic coaster with no banks or loops, but it doesn't cut it for anything complex enough to be fun to ride in VR.Hopefully Oculus Rift support will be expanded in the future to include wandering about the park itself and trying the other rides as well. Right now it's limited to testing out the coasters only.Why recommend it then?Well, this has huge potential. The Workshop support means that there will be hundreds if not thousands of coasters to play with in the future. People can get really creative with this and it's sure to impress, especially if there's more to it than just riding coasters. It also gives me a solid framerate and no judder on my system, I've got a very nice PC 7970 and 3770k, but I can crank everything to max and have it run smooth in VR, which is very nice. A comparatively weak system should be able to run this at lower graphics settings in VR without too much trouble and it still won't look bad either.No management. There are no resources or management happening. It's a creative toy that doesn't need to be managed to enjoy. The focus here seems to be about building and experiencing the rides, not worrying about customer happiness, whether there are enough bathrooms, or the price of hot dogs.  I like games that do that sort of thing, but it's nice to have something like this that is a purly creative tool that can be experienced and shared.Despite the flaws of the Oculus support, it's still a lot of fun to ride the coasters. The camera desperatly needs to be fixed, there are demos that far outclass what this can currently do because of this issue, but when that's fixed it will be a worthy investment due to what can be accomplished with this game.It's also pretty, not amazing or anything, but the graphics look good for a sim sanbox type game. They run well in VR and look good in the DK2 HMD.I recommend this game because it's got huge potential, especially for those with VR. It's not there yet and if you may be better off waiting until the game is further along before picking it up. It's an early Beta though, so it's issues are not unexpected, though it is a bit more unstable than I'd like and that alone almost got it a ""no"" for now. The creative freedom it allows for, the ability to share and download parks, the potential it has in the future, and the fact that it's still fun to play with despite it's flaws made up for that though. If you've got a DK2 I don't necessarily recommend buying it now, but keep an eye on this one and mark it for later. It will be worth picking up once some of it's problems have been ironed out as the beta progresses.			"

								Theme Park Studio.  everyone of all ages love theme parks unless you vomit at the sight of someone hanging upside down or get car sick going over 10 kilometers an hour. The look of this game is nothing short of stellar. The graphics are incredible in every aspect, the physics pretty realistic yet they made them fairly simple.Most games limit to what they give you...this is a toolbox to build, import yours or others work and also contains rides for you to use and also exam to understand how to build your own.This game does have a learning curve, and for those of you that love plug and play might not like it so much. BUT there are ample tutorials in both building rides like the example horse carousel and a core group already that can help or guide you if needed.    I'm still learningf this game, and I am also using a program to also build my own custom stuff for it.   Don't hate something that isn't complete yet. Improvements are being made all the time, yes you may not know all of them but like in a real theme park, part of the joy is the surprise when a new ride comes out.			"

								I am excited about the potential of this game and look forward to its complete development. However, before it is finished, I hope the deveopers will place more emphasis on usimg the mouse rather than the keypad. For instance, scaling and rotating seem to require combinations of shift, alt, and ctrl? I suggest picking scaling or rotating from the menu, and then using the mouse wheel to rotate or scale.			"

								Theme Park Studio is a powerful set of tools that allows you to build the ulitmate theme park. There are some really unique and overall great features in the game. While right now the game is in early acces and still in development, Its a great way to get and learn the game before all the unqiue and cool things are released. With early access you get bugs from time to time and some of features dont work or are not to great to use, these have been bought up to the development team and are being fixed. Overall.. The path editor is good but could use some work,Building and custom scenery are great,And with so many other things and a ton of other things being released. I Highly Recommend gettting Theme Park Studio. For anyone who is looking to build the ultimate theme park. THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU.			"

								If you are a RCT3 fan and expecting an easy-to-use, simple editor to build a nice theme park, don't buy this. This is an in-depth piece of software made to create really anything you'd like. I'm not saying it's a horrible thing because they do this really well. I do experience some crashes here and there but it's expected during such an early stage of this game. I do think that this is better than RCT3 imho just because of the sheer amount of creativity and customizability (is that a word?) there is. I am extremely excited for all the different phases to be complete and for the full game to come out. Overall, I think it's worth 30 USD. Even though most of the features aren't there yet, there is still quite a lot for you to do.			"

Early Access Review
								THEME PARK STUDIO   Is this game worth it, well in my honest opinion yes if you are interested in unlimited outcomes for your park, the only thing stopping you from been creative is your very self. I backed the project back on kickstarter and this game was very close to not even getting made so was really glad when we got to the goal amount just before it ended so lets actually get into why this game deserves a look at.Ok so the game at the moment has been said many times that this is an alpha and anyone who has paid straight up not looking into the info stated are the people moaning that there is no coaster building yet...  all I can say to that is do some research and stick to updates of the game then you wouldn't run into these problems, I've been following the project since day one and have been amazed with how much Pantera has taken on board from the input they have had from the community so they clearly care about their fanbase unlike other devs these days which is a bonus for them and us. Onto the actual game, many people have come into this game thinking it is RCT3 and that is understandable but this is not as this game tool is much more than that. This game has so much potential to be the greatest theme park game ever created, currently it is still in Alpha so don't expect every feature yet but once we get to that full release I can not see this game failing, the community have already started making Custom scenery to add to the game which is amazing for a title what is not even fully released yet, just shows how well intagrated and open the games own tools are. Ok onto the games controls, they work perfectly in my opinion and you can even go upside down with the camera if you truly wanted to.How does the games building tool work in the game ? Well I find the building work on this game to be great, the benefit aswell is you can turn off grid lock mode and just free roam your object anywhere, any direction or even tilt the object if you require it. I think that is truly incredible and just shows in one simple task of the games features how powerful their game tool is already and THIS IS JUST ALPHA at the moment so how can you possibly grumble at it. Paths can be either simple or complicated, currently the paths are created freely so you can place the paths where you want and curve and get really nice arc shaped paths, you can even bend the paths and raise or lower them if you must. One of the main features in this game is the resize option which allows me to resize any object if i feel the need to but I use this all the time on tree placements to re design trees into bushes which I find perfect and can cover up all them empty parts of your park easily if you want to go for that U.k looking park style. Flat rides, there is a couple at the moment which don't have animation until phase 2 but the models of them so far just look stunning. I really am looking forward to phase 2 of this game though as coaster building and flat ride animation will be introduced to the game and if the coaster building is as simple as the other elements have been for me then that is also a bonus. I also messed around with textures, water, lighting and particles but I don't feel I should say too much about them yet when I haven't really work with them enough but I will do once my videos are up so keep an eye out for that.Ok so you may think this guy is only saying good about the game ? Well to be honest I haven't found many issues so far apart from that this game still needs one feature for it which currently isn't in the game and that is a return button feature to return mistakes of deleting a full building you was working on, seriously I have done this a couple of times and it is frustrating but I am sure they can offer us that feature in the future as I know this game is not yet complete.Over all If you truly want a modern THEME PARK SIMULATION GAME  then this game is truly above anything we have had in the past and it should be. I love it! If you have any issues or need a couple of free tips on THEME PARK STUDIO, go check me out on  http://www.youtube.com/talbotdreamOfficialAlso Park guests keep getting mentioned by people, they are coming but won't be in the game until release :)			"

								After spending over 160 hours in Theme Park Studio (not counting the 100's of hours designing flat rides in 3DS Max for TPS), I thought that I would edit my original review. Theme Park Studio, while still in Early Access, has consistently improved phase after phase continuing to add features that the community requested. I have watched the feature sets get better as well, with some of the best features yet to be released. IMO Theme Park Studio is very easy to build a realistic looking park with just a little practice getting used to the controls. The controls are easy to get used to for the beginner, yet has advanced tools that can be comparable to some of the best professional studios out there today. The animation/physics engine in TPS has features that you can't get in any sandbox studio on the market to date. With improved path tools and a new coaster editor, TPS has come a long way since it was first introduced as Early Access to the community. For those of you that are looking for a complete suite of tools to build anything you can imagine, then I recommend that you give Theme Park Studio a try. With Phase 8 coming soon packed with peeps, the ability ride all flat rides, a new 1st person (simulation) view, and a new 64bit build that eliminates any memory problems that existed in the 32bit version, now is the time to check out Theme Park Studio as it's getting better and better.

								As an avid rct 1, 2, and 3 fan. And being apart of the rct3 community this game has a lot of promise to be something great! While being the early release it is expected to have bugs, and what not. But to be apart of a game this early and too be listened too by the developers really is a great attribute! It brings it a step closer to becoming the game that theme park and amusement fans dream of! Customization is a key idea in this game, you can create custom scenery, import easily, make custom paths move the way you want them, resizing, no grid to place things on which makes placement really awesome! But with many more things to come. To be this impressed at such an early stage is a great thing!			"

I know many are going on about how the updates come slowly but In reality they update pretty regurlarly and the updates are huge! They do the greatest job at listening to their fans of the game. If fans want something they work hard to make it happen. I have been playing this game since it first released on early access and It has the potential to being the greatest theme park simulator out there. The customization is insane in this game and you have the freedom to do what you want in your park! Imagine the things you can create in this game! They are also working on making it simple at the same time. But to be honest a few things are frustrating right now but everyone needs to understand that this is early access and that there are going to be bugs but I trust that the developers will work hard to make this the greatest theme park simulator ever! I have no doubt when they finally finish the game that it will be completly amazing! I completly recommend theme park studio to anyone wanting to design their dream park!			"

								Hey everyone,After allmost one year of playing and new features, this game is sooooo much more then a simulation/sandbox. I build some awesome scenerys and coasters. And watch out! You can't compare this game with any other rollercoaster game. I LOVE THIS GAME!Look at my screenshots on my page here at steam. You can build a park very quickly. Just select rides/ shops/ paths/ trees, etc. etc. And within one hour you have an amazing park!And if Pantera goes on like this, I'm sure they have some awesome suprises in store.It is an early access and sometimes you have to wait, but boy is it worth the waiting.So don't hessitate. If you love to build your own park, without any limitations of grids, this game is certainly worth the money!			"

								Early Access shouldn't mean completely unuseable.EDIT: okay, by unuseable I am referring to my crash issues loading SW assets below.In normal edit mode it is useable, but to be honest it's also not the most user friendly system I've tried, and I have extensive experience. Please read my comments in response to the defenders of TPS against any -ve reviews. Try and load a SW scene...crash!Try and load documentation to find out how to do something...empty page!Lower settings to get acceptable performance, they are reset on new scene not saved globally.Was aiming just to play with it for my 5 yr old but it's completely bugged, not a ""little bit buggy""I'll come back to it in a few months.

								Being a fan of RCT I thought this would be a nice addition to my collection. This is nothing like rollercoaster tycoon, this is way more advanced. If you're looking for something like RCT look elsewhere. This is pretty much just an empty landed sandbox that you can build park rides in (if you figure out how to do it). No one visits your park or rides your rides unless they are built into the ride. Maybe it will be a future feature, maybe not. I found this game way too complicated for me. Now this is just my personal experience, some people may find it easy and fun, but a lot of us aren't very construction savvy. I'll stick with RCT for now and see what developes with this game later on down the line. :)			"

								its okfirstly this game has multiple bug and glitches but nothing game breaking it has the tendancy to crash at the drop of a hat, controls are a little hard to master and it can have small lag spikes here and there. but if you liked RTC3 you will like this it has a long way to go and i would not say it is currently worth £22.99 however if in a sale maybe buy it, and when a few updates come out then it would be worth it, currently only buy if you are into rollrercoaster and theme park building, i would also like to see a update where you can control the rides with authentic control panels and to pick which seat you sit in on rides. however i do understand its in early access.is it worth £22.99 not yet			"

								WOW!!!! loving this game so far.  it has a small learning curve to it but once i got it down it opened up a world that I could create and wasn't limited to a grid or certain scenery the only limitation was my own.  This is only the first phase with the bare basics and is already extremely addicting.  I have read certain reviews on steam on just laughed how they started talking trash on a game that is still in develpment as if they didnt understand what that means.  Theme park studio is the RCT we have been waiting for. The unlimited design quality similar to no limits with the ability to see peeps ride your creations and design entire parks!!!  The communtiy has already started making scenery I my self have also started making 3D models due to the ease of importing.  LOVE TPS hope we can get more people from the RCT community to help us make this game into everything we have ever dreamed about and beyond.  GREAT GAME!!!! keep up the great work pantera!!			"

								Amazing game, crashes rather often though, so save a lot, like every 5 minutes. Other than crashing, the game is amazing, the amount of detail you can put into the rides is incredible. Comparing this to RCT3, the game can be a little difficult jumping into, but you get the hang of it pretty quick. The terrain scuplting is actually not bad, much better than RCT3. Painting tracks is a bit awkward, So far I have only been able to figure out how to paint the rails, the ties always turn white... Anyway, I highly recommend this game to anyone who has played RCT3 for a while and is looking for something somewhat easy and the ability to add lots of detailAlso, please fix wooden track supports when it's upside down, it's really annoying. I know, I know, I can custom add them, but it would be neat to have it auto-fill some sort of supports.			"

								Almost ten years after no alternative option to RollerCoasterTycoon 3, Pantera have stepped up to bring us Theme Park Studio, a game that from screen shots and trailers promises to be intuitive in every sense of the word and a worthy successor to the king of theme park simulation franchises.To those of you who felt constrained and restricted in other rollercoaster and theme park game franchises, Theme Park Studio is the game to set you free from these virtual chains. The placement of objects, structures, rides and paths is far more open and varied than the clunky placement of RCT3, which somewhat won over our hearts with its cartoony graphics that seemed like a step backwards from its predecessors. Theme Park Studio however benefits from somewhat realistic graphics [depending on the textures the user decides to unleash]. There are one or two rough areas regarding the graphics thus far, but when the game is fully released and every function becomes available, the landscapes users will be able to create will inevitably look gorgeous and will be leagues ahead of any other franchise.Some of the exclusive modules such as the coaster train designer permit even more creativity from users, promising each park, ride and attraction will be totally unique. One of the most desirable features users have wished for in any theme park franchise to this date is the developer opening their arms to users being able to submit and import custom scenery, rides and attractions easily. With Theme Park Studio, this can be done in a mere few clicks, and downloading CS from the internet will ensure any regular CS users from the RollerCoasterTycoon franchise will be familiar with the location of folder placement.Whilst the game may feel bare at present, there are still plenty of features to explore and master before the game is fully released. Considering the game is in an early access phase and is set to be released in phases, the results that the community have created thus far are incredible. Replicas of the iconic Main Street USA, a theming element featuring the Incredible Hulk that Universal could only dream of, and an extensive plethora of custom designs already on hand thanks to the extremely varied and creative community. By the time Theme Park Studio is fully released, the community contributed material itself will overwhelm the bog standard library content provided with other franchises. And that's without taking into account the gorgeous features Pantera has promised further down the line.I hasten to mention that due to the game being in an early access stage, there are negatives to the experience. Users have reported a series of crashes, path designing being far too complicated and users attempting to get to grips with importing custom models. The latter has been solved by the community, who are dedicated to helping and learning from one another. Pantera went out of their way to address the path issues by adding unplanned elements in the game that allows users to add new intersections and transitional pieces to make paths look even better, as well as a detailed video making the process seem as easy as buttering toast. The developers have been dedicated to release a series of updates [including fixing the camera controls which was a much requested feature since day one by the community] and continue to do so on a small basis before the next phase arrives.If you've been with the theme park and rollercoaster designing franchises since day one, Theme Park Studio is certainly the up and coming development to consider. Whilst the fact that the game is currently only in early access and the remaining features remain yet to be unlocked, the game is promising to derail any other games futile attempts at claiming the throne of theme park and rollercoaster simulators. Whilst the community have had their eyes opened by the prospect of RCT4 being released this year, that will only consist of being 'a PC experience'. Theme Park Studio will be THE PC experience, alongside being an actual video game rather than an internet focused module of course. If you want the full package then unfortunately, you'll have to wait a little while longer before purchasing. But with that said, the content Pantera are promising to deliver is unrivaled in any shape or form, so I fully suggest if you are a potential buyer that you do so now to familiarise yourself with the current system in place. There is going to be a lot of brand new features down the line which thanks to the intuitive features this game boasts, is going to take a while to learn [that said, the learning curve isn't steep and the process is not arduous]. If you haven't been convinced to purchase this game yet, take a long hard look at the videos and screen shots that users have created thus far. I think they'll undoubtedly win you over.Danny.http://forum.themeparkstudio.com/index.php?action=profile;u=97 "

								Theme Park Studio is the best theme park creator out there. TPS is extremely flexible and customizable. Any object can be colored and given a sound, paths and coasters are entirely freeform, as well as the placement of objects. Because TPS does not have a money management aspect, it focuses on realism and additional tools to make the best theme parks possible. Most of the tools are simple to learn and simple to use, but it does require some practice before getting the hang of it. I am able to create the parks of my dreams and walk through them in first person! Not only am I walking through it, but there are also realistic guests who queue in line, ride the rides, and walk around the park with me. It really makes my dream parks come alive. With TPS, I can easily import, build, and animate custom flat rides, as well as make my own custom roller coaster trains. With the Steam Workshop, I can share my parks as well as download parks other people created and walk through them in first person.If you have any interest in building your own realistic theme parks or only played sandbox mode in RCT, TPS is for you. If you are interested in managing a theme park, TPS may not fulfill your expectations.I have been a part of TPS since the Kickstarter and it has only gotten better and grown since. The developer is extremely responsive to the community and our demands. The TPS team is focused on making the best theme park creator out there, and keeps impressing me with every update.			"

												PLEASE BE AWARE that this is NOT A GAME! It's a software to design theme parks. If you want to PLAY a theme park game get Planet Coaster, if you want to design a theme park get Planet Coaster as well. It's superior in every way.TPS is not a bad piece of software, what Pantera did with their resources is remarkable but Frontier Developements just has more people working on one title and therefore more manhours to develop the software.Also... There is still no VR support, the indicator on Steam is wrong.			"

At this point in development Theme Park Studio struugles to cope with large filled park, cause alot of lag which can become really anoying. However if you have a powerfull computer this lag could be reduced however some will stay. If you are wanting a lag free, consistant and polished game, I would wait untill full realease; as for some this game may be fustreating and unplayable in its current state. That assides I would definatley recomend this game as it combines elements from both the RCT Series and No Limits, Have fun playing guys :) !			"

								     Theme Park Studio i would say is a hidden gem of a game.  the controls are simple to learn and   easy to follow tutorials are availibleto help you learn them.  The best thing I feel about this game is the Roller Coaster designer. for those who wish for a more simplistic design and controls they are availible. for those who wish for a more in depth and complex design tool like NL2 it is here too.  the new Rides libray is fantastic and allows you to plop down a ride without having to build it.  However you have a ride you wish to design from the bottom up you can do that too.  The big difference between TPS and other games of this type is that you can builde a whole park  and with the new Live Park feature you and your friends can enjoy yours or thiers park at the same time in a multi-player experiance.    TPS also has a very hands on Dev team, willing to hear what you would like to see in the future or answer any questions you may have.        I would give TPS a big thumbs up indeed			"

								**This is only a review of the VR aspect of the game**I signed up to the VR testing beta and we now have a rollercoaster simulator for the Vive, along with other rides which can be ridden.Admittedly it's early days for the VR side but the devs have already implemented changes which makje the experience better.  So far you have 2 coasters to try, both really good.  They are going to introduce hot keys to get direct to the ride as I have had motion sickness just by walking to the ride with the controller.  The big mystery of how to walk in VR without sickness is yet to be solved.  The hyper jump just ins't convincing for me.Sounds on the coasters could be improved but not bad by any means.  Thery have also fixed the seat issue which had you floating around the seat which is good to see.There are other rides you can try.  In California there is some 2 pod rotating ride, it has nice wind sounds and it defintely makes you feel like you are on the ride and I prefer this to the coasters.  There is also a karting track, but I personally I don't feel it adds anything to the game.Overall in my 2 hours of trying the VR side this is a great start.  Reading the Beta mails, they have a lot more planned as well, so looking promising.If your a Vive owner and you're waiting for a coaster, this ticks the boxes and is ready now.  I know a lot of people have requested the No limits game to have Vive support, but this already has it and more.I will update the more I play and also on the building park side.			"

								Seeing the rollercoasters, now I can recommend this game. But that recommendation is based only on the the rollercoasters.The path system is difficult to use, and doing things like intersecting or splitting paths requires either special pieces which severly limit your designs, or you have to settle with goofy looking overlaps, in other cases you just can't do what you want. There are very few flat rides in the game and very few on the Workshop and those are of varying quality. It's almost as if the developers may plan on relying on their customers to make most of the real content. Most of what I see has me thinking that these guys may be in a little over their heads, or they simply released too early for even early access. I should probably note that my problems with the path system made me largely ignore the terraforming and landscaping tools, so I don't know much about those.But now there's coasters, and while the interface isn't the best, it's not bad. The only tool I find myself really wanting is for the length slider to allow for longer track pieces. The coaster selection is slim but reasonable for the first release, as is the selection of premade special track pieces. You can however make just about any track shape you want, however it's not easy to get things smooth or symmetrical at this point without using the easy editor.So if you just want a really good, likely to be great coaster editor, go ahead and grab this game. Just be willing to accept that development on other aspects of the game may be slow or incomplete, but the developer could finish the game as described and any future RCT titles may be in trouble.

								I see what u guys are trying to get at and i say go for it but i want it to feel more like a game. for example, have a main menu, full screen mode, options tab. Things of that sort. (you could also take the game Kerbal Space Program for example) this game still needs a lot of work and i understand that for it being in early alpha. keep up the good plans and take my suggestions for note. Thanks.			"

								****UPDATE****Finally had time to come back to TPS after a long time away and can testify that most of the points I raised below have been more than adequitely addressed. Sadly I only had time for a quick look and can still see some areas that need further work but there's no doubt that significant progress has been made that leads me to believe that these areas will also in time get attention. Certainly from  the quick look I had I've got little doubt I could now work around any other issues such that they would no longer detract from my enjoyment too much. Based on what I've witnessed I now feel able to recommend this title to those who are interested.**********Been keeping an eye on this and No Limits 2 for a while and decided that now that the first 2 stages of designing coasters had been implemented I'd take the plunge as I wanted a tool for designing a wider world than NL2 is really intended for. I can see the potential in it but there are so many frustrating design flaws that I really haven't enjoyed my time with it so far.First issue is basic camera control. Apparently most users found the original setup really bad so they improved it. If this is the improved version I'd hate to think what the original was like. Okay, it's not terrible but is still very clunky and for a game that involves construction and therefore moving around all the time it should be better. Worst element is that although you can refine the controls there are bugs that mean the game 'forgets' your settings or jumps camera position at times. Bugs in elements like this should have been fixed much earlier in the development lifecycle.Everything from landscaping to placing track pieces is simple but simply complicated if you want to move from default values. The landscaping tools are an example of where you can set parameters, use the tool, use another tool, move back to the first tool and bam, your settings have reverted to defaults again. Because the settings are hidden behind another button you don't see them, click on the screen and damage your landscape. There's no undo feature so getting back to what you had can be a real pain. Forgetting to include an 'undo' function in a construction game beggers belief!Place track and ask it to cut into the landscape - instead of cutting to just below the track surface it sometimes decides to eat a much bigger hole out of the ground instead. Try to raise blocks of terrain to resolve - it seamingly raises or lowers as it sees fit based on surrounding tiles! It's frustratingly difficult on occasion to grab a single terrain tile and raise 1 step at a time.Designing flat rides in game is complicated. Elements like joints etc are in a different group to beams and blocks so you are constantly switching back and forth. Once built you need to add keystone animation. Why not have pre-built ride types where you can just click on individual pieces and edit each bit to create something unique which the game then compiles into an animated finished item using a built in physics engine? The more advanced tools could remain for those that want them. The building blocks are all in game but most people seem to be using an external tool for construction which speaks volumes.I can see the potential in the title and the fact that they wanted to create a powerful design tool to build your theme park but the same level of power could have been achieved in a far more user friendly way. Yes it's early access so bugs and other issues are understandable but there are fundemantal flaws in design concepts that will always exist. RCT3 was simple but limited in building blocks. Pantera should have 'borrowed' the same basic concept of simplicity in this title but expanded on the blocks and their functionality to increase the power. Click and place is fine but more expansive tools and features just aren't as obvious as they could have been. Sure you could design some beautiful creations in this over time but it's just a question of how often you want to bang your head against the wall in the process			"

								This program is really cool, it allows you to create theme parks and ride on the rides, I have had so much fun creating rollercoasters and riding around on them. Although this is more of a tool than a game it still feels like a game. I recommend anyone who likes building theme parks to get this as it's such a cool program.I highly reocmmend watching the video tutorial which is accessed via the help menu :)Original review:Please note this is a tool not a actual game, The main reason I got this was because I thought it would be like RCT but I was seriously wrong, You can build a park and that's it which was a bit of a let down, I'm hoping they add this sometimes as it's kinda boring right now being able to build a theme park but not actually do anything with it, such as riding stuff or anything. The ""game"" itself is pretty nice, I found myself struggling more to figure out how to build in this then I did with all the RCT games which was very surpising after reading other reviews.I think the major issue I have with this game is the description talks about stuff that isn't in the game, sure they will be coming in the future but the description suggests they are already in the game right now. Good tool if you just want to build a theme park but don't want to do anything else with it, bad if you want a RCT style game where you build a theme park, get guests, make money, expand etc.(I will be adding and changing this review as the game progresses as it's in early access)			"

								This game has lots of potential. People are already adding stuff to steam workshop. The controls take little time to learn but once you get use to them you will enjoy yourself, and you have limtless possiblities in this game. Even though it is in beta it still blows RTC 3 out of the water. I can't wait for future updates to be realeased. Like some people said about the game, the only real limitation of the game is your imagination.For somereason after Phase 4 they added more bugs than when SimCity 5 when it came out. Seriously what is going on. I know its early access, but the amount of bugs that were added is crazy. I hope EA isn't giving them suggestions of how to build games.Edit: Looks like they finally fixed everything. Running smoother then ever.			"

								I realize the game is in development and there are going to be issues with it.  I love the concept and wanted to support it's development which is why I purchased it while in early access.  After starting the game there are currently several problems I am facing with it.  First and formost the game is very sluggish making it very difficult to work with.  Second the game crashes when trying to load a template, a premade park or a flat ride that is already created.  I want to like this game a be able to recommend it once iti is completed,  However if it continues to stay sluggish and crash on me once the game is completed then I will have felt like I wasted my $30 for a piece of software that doesn't work properly and i will not be able to recommend the game.  Based on concept alone I will go ahead and recommend it.			"

Also the camera controls are hard to use rather than No Limits 2, which I'd recomend getting rather than this, which makes it easy to change what view your seeing by using WASD and hitting left click on the mouse and moving it in any way to change the area ur looking at. For now dont get it but once they add more look into getting this gem.			"

								[This is from a purely VR point of view, using DK2.]tl;dr - It's rollercoasters in VR; that's what it's all about right?[PROS]You know those fairground rides that feel that little bit too mechanical, that sometimes go just a little bit too fast and the ones that cause you to have a reality check when you realise you are strapped to a machine?  You know, the really good ones?   I actually felt like I was on one of those. :DThe ride you should defo go on first (the one I am gushing about) looks like a wind turbine, with just one long blade spinning in the middle and a cage at either end of the blade.  In VR it's awesome!  You watch the safety bar go down over you, the platform drops and then you start spinning.  It's convincing.  It's probably the VR experience I have enjoyed the most so far on any game.  It's also quite a buzz standing underneath the ride just watching it.  It's that good!The game clearly uses physics too.   The trains feel like actual trains and to my laymen's understanding, behave like them.  For instance if a train doesn't quite have the oomph required to get over a crest of a peak, it will rocked back and forth between the slopes it is in until it slows to a stop. The rollercoasters are fully simulated rides and quite convincing in VR!Apparently the game's main feature isn't VR but the comprehensive set of design tools used to create and share your own rides.  I didn't bother with those but if anyone out there wants me to try out one of their creations, the intenser, the merrier. Bring it on! [Please please PLEASE! When / if designing for VR, make it convienient for us to get to your rides i.e. please make it easy to get straight to the good stuff! Thanks! ;) ]Also, constant 75 fps using DK2 on my rig, which is just shy of Oculus' recommended specs too.[CONS]Most of these issue are about getting to and from the rides, the rides themself are fab!Some things will no doubt be fixed, probably by the time you read this, e.g. at the time of writing the movement controls could do with some refining - strafing left and right would be handy etc.  Oh, and you have to do the Oculus Home confirmation screen each time you load a map.In VR (only concerned with VR!), the fact the game is first and foremost a theme park designer, means at the moment it is a little rough around the edges.    The player can sometimes clip through objects or go to areas they shouldn't.  I have found I try to behave and follow the path like a good Theme Park customer!  Also, the gates can be a little tight for us to get through.@Developer: Would it be possible to provide a small set of tools for those designing parks for VR?  These could include extra wide gates to make it easy for us in VR to walk through!  Simply doubling the size would resolve this AND double size would mean the fences used for the rollercoasters would still match the train's doors?  :)TBH, the rides are the main feature and they are awesome!  I can't wait to try this on my mates!			"

								Oh my gosh Theme Park Studio is the most fun I have had on the Vive and received the download immediatly. I just spent the whole day at a family gathering showing off all my vr games to 20 people or so and people loved the virtual reality experience but when I pulled Theme Park Studio out my 'virtual' bag, people were literally qeueing up to have a go. Theme park studio is the perfect mix of instant gratification and deep involving editor. In virtual reality just load up a park and jump on any ride you like. Its a perfect party game that had my whole family in stitches watching each other ride peoples nausiating contraptions. We even had a competition of who could make it to the end of a rollercoaster whilst standing up without falling over. That afternoon alone made it worth the money but beyond that there is a completely open editor to allow you to create your very own themepark and rollercoasters for other people to enjoy. Cant wait to test out my next creation on my friends and family :)			"

								Seems like a great theme park creation game but it takes dedication and time to create anything substantial, especially compared to Roller Coaster Tycoon 3. If you're willing to put in the time to make a good park with LOTS of freedom at the expense of a steep learning curve in some aspects, then this is the game for you. But if you want an easier experience at the expense of more restrictions, better stick with Roller Coaster Tycoon. I heard the next one should be coming out later this year. Really, I could take the time to learn this game/simulator but I just decided to wait for the next Roller Coaster Tycoon. One of the things I loved about Roller Coaster Tycoon was being able to download and experience park recreations by other people. I think the ease of use of the game made it so more people could have the ability to make and upload them. For this game, the workshop is slacking and I think it may be because of that learning curve I mentioned earlier.I only recomend this game if you're willing to put the time and effort into it. I just went back to RCT3			"

I am sorry to report that if VR is your thing, absolutely do not get this game or you will be very dissapointed. The developers have made little to no progress in VR. Since this game is making slow progress in general, the developers should immediately abandon trying to use their own engine and instead start using Unity or Unreal. They will be far ahead of where they might be otherwise. This game is going nowhere for VR on the path they are on. Wrong scale, unusable navigation and mediocre graphics.			"

This game is under development - and will be eternally!Okay, it was MY mistake to buy this game - it really was, I didn't notice the size of the studio that was actually making this project, I severely underestimated the likeliness of dark rides ever coming - they were my actual only reason for buying this. Dark rides will likely never come to such a small studio's game - this was tooooo big a project for the team behind it. Waaay too big, really!I can't say that I don't recommend this game in its current state - I instead, don't recommend the game at all, as half the things you anticipated will never come to this game - and only when they do, should you buy it. Wanna make flume rides, or dark rides, have advanced animations and animatronics? Cool, so do I, instead don't be a ♥♥♥♥ing idiot - JUST WAIT! Wait until those features come - then only when they're in the game in a secure feature, then only can I recommend considering buying this.Do not...

								Apparently even though this product is marked with the Vive symbol, it is not yet ready for the Vive. I even purchased this game after receiving confirmation of ""beta testing"".  After a week after receiving my confirmation of the beta test, I've been sent no code (probably because of the negative review), and as of this moment you still need a code (changing the settings won't work) to get VR to work, and if they don't send you the code, you get NO VR.  What a mess. I feel like I wasted $30.			"

								Its a shame.In 2014 I spent over 50€ for this ""Masterpiece"", now over 2 years of further developing it is still only a peace of crap, unuseable.The graphics are awful, all look very monotone, there is something missing that makes it beautiful.The rides are looking awful ... like a bunch of cubes, has nothing to do with realism (thats what it should be, what me was told at different times).But the most problems are the hugh amount of bugs it still has. Created a coaster, used the undo-button once and the whole project was destoyed (coaster went underground, track was destroyed, ...).Also the developement is a failure.Now there is a feature called ""livepark"" ...  some ""networking"" thing.They put a lot of time in it, but that does not make sense, since the bugs are out.You cant even load or save your park, also this is bugged, and then they work on such a feature ???Water is still only on one level possible, that is also not realistic, you cant build seas or realistic terrain with that, and the next thing is, if you want to include the bumperboats you also have the problem with this ""only-one-waterlevel-thing"".The guys creating / programming this piece of sh*t do not know how to build a game.Watch a little bit deeper and you will see many awful things .. like : Ride-Lights are flat pieces and only depend of textures.One of the best things is themselves. In their forum is a subforum called ""Darkrides"", managed by someone whos called ""Bill Zanetti"". Nothing happens in this subforum or this thematic, dont know if that guy is still alive or watching coasters from underground.If you have a question about darkrides you still get the answer that it is not possible because it violates the rules (they are strong christians, and it seems that darkrides are generally a bad thing, like the Spongebob-Squarepants-Darkride).Thats not understandable for me anyway and anymore.Over two years and still a not useable result, thats not acceptable for me. The developement is very slow, much too slow. They say they are only a small team, -> thats Ok, BUT you cant give customers a vision of a powerful simulaton-software, when the company is only a ""Two-Men-Show"" and you dont have the manpower to do so.TPS is one of the few things in my live where I am very unhappy with spending money on it.Refunds? Not possible, because working with this bugged ""program"" took too much time to figure out that it will even not get what it was supposed to be, maybee in the next comming 3 years, but I am not willing to wait for that time anymor after the last 2 years.

								Theme Park Studio is okay. I like some of the features, but most features I dislike. I understand that the game is in Early Access, but I think I'll wait until the game is released in Beta.There are a lot of things missing from the game. People still have not been added, so I'm waiting for that. Building paths and coasters can be confusing. I like the way paths could be constructed in RCT3, where it was easy to do things. TPS has more free flow, but intersections are almost impossible to make.Coaster building is somewhat like in RCT3 where there are premade sections you can build. It also has a touch of NoLimits because you can have more free flow to your rides. There's just a problem with block sections and adding new trains. I could not find a way to color my rides either. Smooth and straight options are desperately needed.If you decide to terraform, make sure you do it before adding trees. If you add trees first, the terrain will raise around the trees so it looks like the trees were dug into holes in the ground.I found many bugs and glitches in the game. It never completely crashed, but it froze many times. I stopped playing it mainly because of that.5/10 - It's okay, but needs a lot of work. I recommend waiting until it's completely finished.			"

												Let's be honest.TPS is a different type of product than Planet Coaster and TPS has features Planet Coaster and others do not.  Pantera worked hard, did what they said they would do, and the game has merit. For instance, it has VR support which Planet Coaster does not as shown in this video:


YouTube™ Video: Let's try Theme Park Studio in VR (HTC Vive) 

			Views: 234		

			GPU: GeForce GTX 1070 CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40GHz Memory: 16 GB RAM (15.93 GB RAM usable) Current resolution: 1920 x 1080, 60Hz Operating system: Microsoft Windows 10 Home		

It has steerable Go Karts, Bumper Boats, and  Dodge-em Cars which the others do not have.It has the ability to create your own custom flat ride and animate it, the others do not.TPS lets you import your own custom made content, Planet Coaster does not.The ability to enter your park as a peep and ride all the rides, Planet Coaster doesn't allow you to be a peep without a cheat code.I see so many Negative reviews on Steam even by people that would recommend the game but are afraid to go against the crowd. what do people think will happen by not crediting them?  If there is no support, why should they even bother to update post release? It is a shame after so much work it is being tossed in the trash especially when they brought so many unique and powerful features to the theme park design table...just to have no reward or credit in the end.   Pantera even went above and beyond what they committed to in their original road map, just to be discredited.  I just don’t’ get why people need to destroy other products, that have merit and are credible, just to show devotion to 1 product and follow hate trends.I have both games, Theme Park Studio and Planet Coaster. But, I don't tear either down just to be one of the ""In Crowd"".Both have strengths and both have weaknesses, but after everything is said and done I would still recommend Theme Park Studio as well.

								It is frustrating to work with! The undo buttons don't work. Any mistakes are permanent and heaven forbid should you forget to save every 10 seconds! Forget about easy orientation! Trying to get an object to turn, twist, or face a certain direction is hell! The biggest problem is trying to use the special effects. Want to make a waterfall? Nope, not going to happen. Want lights to glow at night? Nope. The camera is frustrating to work with - not user friendly. Unless you designed the ""game"" you will not be able to do anything with this. I've had this thing for a long time and I can't use it anymore. It pisses me off to no end.			"

								This game needs work right now, there are so many things that need fixing or adding, I have a list of what needs to be done to the game to make it better1 make it easier to use, the editors and such are confusing and kind of a pain to use, like if you want to edit the coasters lift speed you have to open a bunch of menus and click on each induvidgual segment,it would be much easier to click on the coaster and have all the options for that coaster show up like color, lift/ launch speed, train type, number of trains, ect. and also make retexturing objects easier becuase i can't figure it out2 the game needs a way to either speed up or slow down the game, because with me playing on a computer with the minimum specs to run the game I could speed up the game to compensate for the lag3 Modular building, there is some building in the game but it need alot of work, maybe allowing you to press a button the enable a grid to make sure your wall line up with each other, it also would be nice if there were some rocks for custom rockwork4 premade partical effects like smoke, mist, fire, water splashes ect.

Playing this game is nothing like the videos, and the custom scenery import option is a nightmare to use. It's just one huge long list.I think I'll stick to Planet Coaster when that comes out.I'll change my review if things do change in the future. But in its current state, don't bother.			"

The thing is though nothing shows up on the viewer. I have a completely white screen. This is a known issue, there's a thread on the steam forums thats 3 months old and still nothing has been done. Edit** I have redownloaded this to a different PC and it's working fine. My other PC has some settings that were conflicting with the program. At this point I've been building a coaster and everything is working nicely. I changed my review to a thumbs up because this is exactly what it says it is.			"

								This game looks like it has a lot of potential, but slow delivery of the updates, missed deadlines, and just a very fustrating expierience during the game has left me writing this game off until it has undergone many inprovements.I fell for their Kickstarter campain back in May 2013. Promises were made, and I understand that things happen. But we are now comming up to nearly TWO YEARS after that kickstarter campain finished, and this game is still lacking.I have not put much time into this game because I find it annoying / fustrating. The camera movement is hard to adjust to, using the mouse to adjust the camera is awkard, Building anything takes a lot of time. No easy way to undo anything. I dont know how many times I have messed up on something simple, like creating a path, and just got mad because a simple undo feature is nowhere to be found.With more work, this game could be a lot of fun. I will be watching FB and the Steam Store page for updates.			"

								Do not waste your hard earned money on this piece of junk game. It is full of bugs and is next to impossible to use becuase the control interface doesn't work properly for starters. I just wasted a couple of hours (again) trying to design what should have been a simple entrance plaza building only to find that one of my paths just under the entry building had moved out of place. I wasted thirty dollars on this piece of crap game...which is still in development and hasn't been officially released yet and isn't worth the time and money on.I think I'll wait for RCT World to come out,because it least the developers of RCT World have far more experience making a theme park simulation game than pantera ever has.

								I can not recommend this game! I know its early access but a house will not get better than its fundament! NoLimits2 is much more better! Even the old RCT3 is much more better! Do not waste your time on this garbage!The handling is absolutely not intuitive and you have always problems to do anything what is straightforward and very easy with other software! (i.g. RCT3 or NoLimits2)I tried TPS out about 100 hours but most of it offline so you can not see it! Please look also on my experience hours in RCT3!My son also prefer RCT3 complete over it although it is much older.I use NoLimits2 also available here on steam its the best coaster/park editor/simulator you have ever seen! Look at the videos and tutorials!If I could I would like to get my money back for TPS! Now at the end of 2016 this game has very much very bad reviews! They also have removed many people from the discussions only because they realised that this game is grab from beginning!			"

Even later after my 1st review, i felt robbed for buying the game, as the game didn't offered what i was hoping for.At that time, I was looking for a Theme Park Sandbox, that had the realism and beauty of No Limits but is as easy to get into as a Roller Coaster Tycoon for exampleNow in 2016, with huge competitors like: Planet Coaster from Frontier and RollerCoaster Tycoon World from Atari, which offer nearly the same aspects, if you play one of theese games in sandbox mode, i think Thempark Studio will have some hard times.It's nice to see an active Workshop with cool content and also i am still looking forward seeing this game getting better which each update.But as of today i have to say i will stick to Planet Coaster as it offers everything i was looking for and hoping fro from a Theme Park Game.

								Oh my god this was HORROR. I used this for a project when we had to design a theme park. I thought it would be perfect. Oh my god was i wrong. if your computer is not fast, DO NOT GET THIS. This will work, all the way...till IT CRASHES. After it crashes, if you don't save frequently, you lose all your work.Not to mention, since everything loads as you build, after you go back in NOTHING LOADS. And everything slows to a crawl. You will barely be able to move around the map, build more, add anything. It was terrible. The water was really bad as well. Sometimes the coasters you build will glitch and water will rise up on the structures. It doesn't flood or anything, it just looks bad and it annoying. Building roads was not as easy as it claims to be. One slight wrong move, your road is crazy bent, and hard to fix. Overall, this is an okay software, but i don't reccommend it. You are better off using a REAL themepark studio maker.			"

								0/10 - Lacks what it means to be a 'game' - It's more so design softwareI purchased this in 2014 - Almost 2 years have passed, I cannot get past 3 hours game-play - this is why : The biggest thing this 'game' lacks is atmosphere, there is nothing, it's as exciting as a quiet visit to the town library, also the fact that the game runs in a window, similar to running an excel spreadsheet, does little to immerse you into the game. Basic things like buttons, do not have labels, requiring a lot of guess work, the game basically looks like one of those home design programs where you plop and place objects, which may look nice, but has absolutely zero substance.Do you want to know why games like Roller Coaster Tycoon were so popular? They have atmosphere, noise, ambience, they make you feel like your running a real theme park that is all about fun, this game, if you can call it that, is not about fun. It feels like learning to master a program like 3DSMax. Either way, not a complete game, but who cares, paying for a game means you absolutely no right to criticise it in any way, as with the game forums, you'll soon find if you have anything negative to say, the townsfolk will be out at you with torches and pitch forks.

								[ORIGINAL]Sorry, but this is hardly worth the price. Although the idea of a next-gen RCT3 is great, this game fails to deliver. Although I understand that the game is in EA, it does not feel like a game and is nowhere near fun. The textures are gloomy and the ambiance is very dull-looking, as opposed to the fun and jolly RCT series. It feels more like an engine (without rollercoasters and ride-ins) than an actual game worth $30. I will update this review as new updates and phases come out, with my review hopefully changing for the better by than. It's a no buy for me at the moment though.			"

								Not recommended. If you buy this game you'll regret it.No Limits 2 is a million times better and in terms of physics and performance, is how it should be done. No Limits 2 has much better community activity where you can download other people's coasters to ride. Supports Oculus too. Further more, if you make a contribution to the forums about TPS, you may regret that too as you could be banned for the slightest negative suggestion. There's an awkward  ""keep them in line"" attitude, which either comes from an inexperienced teenage moderator, or a crusty old guy waving his ban stick at anything he doesn't like. Fun fact: I found out it's the latter.I received a permanent ban from the moderator after just one post. When I questioned the ban, the moderator stated that he was a ""CIO with 25 years experience in the IT industry"". He also stated that he is a ""senior manager who sits on four boards etc"". He basically ranted his resume at me.  I mean, seriously?You don't ban someone after one post. My post was not offensive or anything, it just raised a  concern about the quality of the product and the over-moderation of legitimate on-topic ideas from other users. Their response? Permanent ban with the reason that I was ""offensive and broke the forum rules"" etc. Anyway, about TPS. The interface is annoying. Lack of undo is a joke. I don't mean ""delete last object"", I mean universal undo for all position changes, additions, deformations etc. It's the nature of terrain shaping and object alignment in 3d applications. You could be in for a painful experience if you try to put things back the way you had them a moment ago. In short, you can't put things back the way you had them a moment ago.It takes time to get things looking right in TPS. It's quite frustrating most of the time.The graphics seem dated, like something from the 90s.Wait until it's free, but by that time the bloat of the program, the tacked on features, and the much better options out there such as No Limits 2, means even when it's free, it won't be worth your time.

								This certainly has the potential to be a good editor, but at it's current stage it's no better than RCT3. The track editing isn't quite well done enough to create smooth, Nolimits-style tracks, but it's not quite as limited as RCT. In my opinion it doesn't quite work - you need it to be like one or the other, not both.Also, their customer support is very poor and uncooperative. Try not to go near that.Edit: 2 years later and it's hardly progressed. Really not worth £22 at all. Just get NoLimits.			"

								I purchased this game with high hopes but was severely disappointed. The game constantly freezes and crashes. I couldnt even play for more than 5 minutes at a time. My computer more than exceeded the system requirements and I was even running it on the lowest level graphics to be sure. I play other games like 7 Days To Die, Sims 3, Sims4 and SimCity with no issues. I will definitely be going back to RCT3. So sad, this looked like it had such potential. I hope the full release will show much improvement because their ideas are great but execution is poor. I wish I could have at least played it for more than a couple of minutes at a time!			"

								I'm a huge fan of the RCT1 gameplay but sometimes I want to create a coaster that looks nice and/or rides nice. Because the latter is not possible in RCT3, I had two choices: NoLimits 2 or Theme Park Studio, I decided to try both.In my experience, NL2 is far easier to use than TPS and it's also much faster (on my old, terribly slow machine TPS ran at 70% in an empty park, while NL2 still runs at full speed if you ride a coaster without scenery, edit: performance update coming soon). In four hours I'm still far from used to the controls of TPS while I got used to the NL2 controls within one hour, probably less. Good thing is that the path building has been improved (and it really, really needed it).For my needs, Theme Park Studio is absolutely not the correct program (even though I thought it would be), and thus I won't recommend it.For reference, this is wanted to do:-Design crazy track parts (and randomly add the rest of the coaster), usually without any kind of scenery-Ride great coasters made by othersBoth programs have great rides made by others, but where TPS goes more for the simpler just click to build a piece of track (which is easier to get started with), NL2 allows you to easily modify every piece of track into ultimate detail which fits my experimental style of coaster building much better. It took a bit longer for the very first basic coaster (the built in step-by-step tutorial will help), but from then up to the control level I desired was much faster.			"

								Way too unpolished to consider giving time or money up for. Main highlight of their ads is for the coaster building - there are no coasters yet. Nearly 6 months after the release we're looking at something that looks like it was released 2 months ago. When I think of the name ""Pantera"", I think of speed - the band, the car. THIS Pantera is taking their sweet♥♥♥♥♥time with completing this game. They got my money this time but ""Early Access"" and ""Pantera"" are now etched deep into my mind. Never again...			"

								While the Roller Coaster editor is all shiney and new and user friendly, the rest of the program is less than easy to use unless you trawl through hours and hours of out of game tutorials and youtube videos. It can be extremely tedious at times (apart from the coaster editor... yes, yes, I know, it's easy to use and fun... blah blah blah I am NOT talking about the coasters!!) when you are building paths and you are unsure how the nodes connect or keep forgetting to select specific nodes to continue construction etc. The buildings I am sure require just as much patience to get the hang of also. While I do not dislike this program, I can't recommend it for everyone. This program (apart from the coaster editor! yes yes I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT THE COASTER EDITOR!) is more suited to people with more focus and patience.Just for a comparison. Planet Coaster was easy to use, more detailed and continues to get improvements and more user friendly constantly. Not really any need for a learning curve or tedious tutorials.			"

Original ReviewI know there's a void for park builders right now, but this doesn't fill it for me. I want to build a park with objective and an easy to use, fullscreen game engine. My favorite park builders are the RCT franchise, and this is too much of a developer-class program for me. There are no objectives, no restrictions, and no enjoyable moments to this. If you're looking for an alternative after Atari's RCT World trailer came out, you're out of luck here.UPDATE: RCTW EA is out, Planet Coaster is in AlphaThe competition has come out. Finally. So first, Planet Coaster looks like it's going to come out on top for those who want a game-like management experience. Roller Coaster Tycoon World looks like RCT3 with slightly better graphics and slightly worse engine. Theme Park Studio, it's an editing tool. Not a management game. Don't be decieved. Don't buy it if you're at all interested in the management side or an actual game, and don't be decieved by RCTW's lower price compared to Planet Coaster for early access. Planet Coaster is the best park sim in the works right now. But if you want a complex studio tool that's EXPLICITLY built for making park rides, then maybe this will be the one for you. For most people, I don't think so.			"

Early Access Review
								When I first heard about this game, I was extremely excited: there was the possibility of a photo-realistic RCT successor with great flat-ride support and integrated scenery. I backed it on Kickstarter and eagerly anticipated the launch date. I then got the game, and was slightly disappointed. I understand that the game is still in Early Access, but there are a few major problems that I need to address:1. Reliability: one thing you'll remember from all three versions of RCT are their incredible stability. RCT1 and 2 were even built using x86 assembly language, which, despite being old, results in an EXTREMELY crash-proof game (except when using trainers, but that's to be expected). TPS crashes fairly often, which, although being understandable for an early-access game, does not warrant the price tag they are asking. 2. Realism: Ok, so photo-realism is achieved in some cases, but not to the breadth I would have liked. The rides look great, but the included shops seem so cartoony that putting them next to rides is pretty odd looking. The built-in scenery editor is useful for overcoming this, but that comes with what I consider the biggest flaw of the game to be, which is3. Interface: This program seems almost user-hostile. Yes, there are shortcut keys for everything, along with mouse movements, but the control clunky, options don't make sense, and will sometimes do different things in different situations, and buttons exist that have really no right to exist. One of the best examples is with paths: there's a button to build new paths and a button to continue a path that has already been built. But a button with the same image is also used to bring up the path editor menu. The only thing I liked about the interface was the docking system, when it worked, but there were a few times when the docking menu crashed the game (guess it wasn't finished yet.)I understand the game is still in Early Access, but I cannot in good faith recommend it, especially when better alternatives exist on Steam "

I'm very disppointed as the sponsored reviews made reference to it being comparable to Rollercoaster tycoon.  After an hour of searching, reading tutorials, and frustration, I was unable to even build a rollercoaster and activate the park with guests.  It's more of a modeling program than a game. If anyone can show me I'm greatly mistaken in my review, I am more than happy to listen as I had high hopes for this game.  Otherwise, I will write this game off as a loss.:-(After additional reading, I'm learning now that this game is a work in progress with a lot of basic funcationality missing.

								Definitely not ready for any sort of early release. Skip this for now. This is barely more than a dev kit at this point. There is absolutely nothing to do except pick and place models right now to create the illusion of a theme park. There is a road map for updates, and some look exciting, but a ""game"" built on promises hasn't been a terribly successful strategy in this industry. I expected to see some form of a solid foundation, and am presented with nothing of remote value. I would be a seriously weary investor at this point, I have no confidence in this title's future. I'll be amazed if this is around long enough to make it to full release.			"

								Having backed the game on Kickstarter I was incredibly hyped for the game, following every video and trying to find any evidence of the game. This looked like it could be the best rollercoaster simulator since Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 and looked like it could mix the best of the RCT franchise with the detail of No Limits. However, when the game came out I was severley dissapointed. Of course the features were limited at first, but that was expected. But when features rolled out, my buyers remorse incrased. I had originally written a positive review of this game, optimistic of its future. Now I feel ripped off on spending £20 on this game. If you want realism, go purchase No Limits (haven't used No Limits 2 yet but it looks fantastic) and if you want a more fun central game go play any of the first three Rollercoaster Tycoon Games, Parkitect or Planet Coaster (which again I am yet to play but looks stunning). Theme Park Studio is incredibly buggy, features infuriatingly buggy controls and a coaster builder that will make you punch a hole right through your monitor. Save yourself, don't get this game.			"
