The graphics are not the best but thats not a issue, the managment is deep and the difficulty is spot on. For a bluey you can be sorted for a life time!10/10			"

												Funny things is: I installed this game a week ago from a CD I have since 2006, and now it's on Steam. Bought it anyway, more easy when I want to play it on other PCs.Well, to the game. If you like the first 2 Roller Coaster Tycoon, you'll like this one. It's simple, it's a top-down view, you can only rotate the camera 90 degress, you know, basic Roller Coaster stuff. You create train tracks and streets as if you were creating roller coasters on RCT. There's no secret.The soundtrack plays accordingly to the year you're playing, it's awesome. Very relaxing.The game starts very very easy, so you can learn basics. However, when you reach harder levels, the difficulty rises significantly. Isn't easy to play against 7 CPU controlled rival companies when you have to reach a 90% performance Index.You may have problems understanding train tracks, routes and signalling when you start, but nothing that a little search doesn't fix. Isn't something complicated, once you understand it will be easy. Also isn't not THAT important that you learn about signaling if you're not making crossed tracks.Anyway, I have over 2000 hours on Locomotion using my old disc (I play this since 2006, on a Windows 98). It's simple, relaxing and can be really challenging on harder maps even if you KNOW how to play properly.			"

												Buyers beware (this is a extremely old game and dose not properly work with windows 7, 8 or 10. All I know is when playing on Windows 7 with a Nvidia card the screen at random will go crazy. So save often and you should be fine. Everything else works as normal.)I do recommend this game even with the issues I stated above and the more you play the longer it takes to break it seems. There's no real campaign just ""missions"" but its still fun even if you don't play with the missions and just ""free play"". Its fun and despite the poor graphics it has a nice art style and has great music. There are so many vehicles to buy and use. All have different stats. Also the AI is really dumb or really smart at times. For $6 its a worthy purchase and I would buy it all the time despite its bugs.Update seems the issue with the screen going crazy is because of the steam overlay but still save often.I will be attempting to make a guide but I hate writing things so don't count on it XD			"

												Uttermost Brilliance, Chris Sawyer's rules of property management collide with that of a transport tycoon. A much-awaited return of a wonderful ""Sequel"" To Transport Tycoon; now delivered to the Steam Community. This, without a doubt, is a personal favorite of mine, the sense of real-world management is within the gameplay.[Including]-Multiple Variations of Nationalities, including transportation styles according to Era.-Real-World Management, including establishment of revenue and area of operations.-A challenging business: Disasters [Crashes], rivals, industries, and your decisions play a huge impact on the liabilites and credibility your company possesses.-The Ability to Create a Transportation Industry, 'nuff said.-Train Horns, I adore trains.All In All, I reccomend this game to those who are accquainted with Chris Sawyer's works, including Roller-Coaster Tycoon, or to those who simply wish to run a company and feel challenged by the world around them. 10/10-PSCTD			"

												In 1995, Chris Sawyer painstakingly coded Transport Tycoon in assembly. To those of you not familiar with software engineering, programming in assembly is like driving a car by pouring fuel into the engine and turning the wheels yourself, as opposed to Java, which is more like driving a car by letting your cat do it.Everybody loved Transport Tycoon, mostly because nobody could afford train sets. This is still the case, which is why OpenTTD exists.Seeing as nobody really cared about the other forms of transport in the game, himself included, Chris Sawyer made a sequel and named it Locomotion to make it abundantly clear that even if you find anything in the game that's not a train, you are strongly urged to ignore it. It's like the man is saying ""trust me, you're not really here for the lorries that stop whenever they're being overtaken - I mean, do you even know what a lorry is? Thought so. Also the ships that are even more bland and slow than in the last game? They're that way so you can have the fun of building twisting railway bridges over the ocean because I built the game on the engine of a rollercoaster game I made! The second one! You'll never guess which! Also have fun hammering that left mouse button!""To be fair, there's still some fun to be had building twisting mountain railroads and even bridges above entire cities using the rollercoaster tycoon 2 building tools. And you have the same degree of freedom, if not more, when digging underground, which is something not many games offer - which is a shame, I mean, if we take the Locomotion system and remove the part where you have to demolish everything on surface before you can edit anything underneath it (which in case of metro systems spells bad news for most of the above city's populace), as well as the part where your index finger and your mouse button partake in an endurance competition when building long stretches of rail, it might just make for fun and challenging railway building.Of course you'd also have to code an AI that would not cheat in every way imaginable to build hideous twisting skyrails all over the map, covering much of it underneath in some kind of bizarre train fetishist orwellian fantasy, where the lower class lives underneath many layers of railroad bridges as their train overlords stroll on the surface while you and AIs as olympian gods watch from above, with you trying to convince Zeus Transport to stop being a♥♥♥♥♥♥and not take your cargo.I'm afraid being religious still won't help when all your trains start breaking down every fifth tile of the way, no matter how much you pray for it to stop. Old man Chris would just never admit those were bad design, no, you absolutely have to do nothing but replace trains once you have more than 20 of them, it is so much fun, you see, you just fail to appreciate the genius behind it. You know what else is genius, Chris? Me taking a♥♥♥♥♥♥on your face.That's not to say Chris Sawyer's Locomotion is a bad game, it just leaves a lot to be desired. It repeats many of the mistakes of Transport Tycoon, but it still improves on the basic formula enough for me to let it slide. In fact, if somebody were to tell me there was a sequel by the man in the works, you can bet I would preorder in an instant, then just copypaste this review over to that game's steam page and it would still be relevant.Even if it's not perfect, Chris Sawyer's Locomotion is still a Transport Tycoon 2 under a different name, and that means something.

												I played this game back when it was first released, but as a kid I couldn't really appreciate it in its entirety.  A lot of work went into this game, and it shows, despite the obvious graphical inferiority of it.  The attention to detail and creativity is borderline amazing.  For anyone who likes business management/tycoon-like games, this is definitely worth looking at.  Pros:-Different types of transportation-Scenario Editor, so you can create your own maps and landscapes-Watching as the business you bring to a town/city causes its rapid growth-Music is very unique-Precursor to OpenTTD-Old/Retro feel-Great De-stresserCons:-Graphics are pretty bad-layout can be annoying at times-Not really sure if multiplayer works, but I had to activate DirectPlay in order to even set myself as a host.  It may be restricted to LAN, but I haven't tried playing a game because my friends aren't exactly keen on the whole management thing.  If you need help activating DirectPlay on windows 8/10, feel free to add me.-Music can get repetetive-AI are super duper annoyingly goodAll in all, I'd give this game a thumbs up.  I haven't had any issues with it crashing, except for when I Alt+tab, so make sure that you save before tabbing out.			"

												This, like most other 'tycoon' games, is something you either like or couldn't care less about. It's an extremely simple game with simple gameplay and simple (but pleasing!) graphics. Still runs fine with no issues whatsoever, but saying that, it's not exactly a demanding game for your computer to run. It's only real issue is caused by the AI companies, which tend to make a complete mess of the landscape as they build their infrastructure.At the bare minimum this is a great time waster. You can be blasé and build train tracks and roads while running YouTube or music or whatever in the background. It's also surprisingly satisfying to watch a small village grow over time into a large metropolis, courtesy of your efforts.You can, however, play its predecessor Transport Tycoon for free, with mods. This game is pretty much identical in every way to TT, but it's still worth playing if you're into these sort of games.			"

												ENG:Well laid out a clone of the original corresponding OpenTTD game, although the game is older so still, I prefer the original Transport Tycoon series. This game is not much improved in such a way that it would be more functional and more stable with newer computers as opposed to OpenTTD game. The game is mostly otherwise really good and simple, which I appreciate, but, a basic element seems to be missing from what you are used to using the OpenTTD game series and it is also more difficult than the OpenTTD game.For this reason, I can't fully recommend the game, because when OpenTTD is free and all the other far better made and implemented, including further development of the game.50/50 recommendations. :3FIN:Hyvin toteutettu klooni alkuperäisesta vastaavasta Openttd pelistä, vaikka peli onkin vanhempi niin silti, pidän enemmän alkuperäisesta Transport Tycoon sarjasta. Kyseistä peliä ei ole juurikaan paranneltu siten että, se olisi toimivampi ja vakaampi uudemmilla tietokoneilla toisin kuin OpenTTD peli. Peli on pitälti muuten todella hyvä ja yksinkertainen, jota arvostan mutta, moni peruselementti tuntuu puuttuvan siitä mitä on tottunut käyttämään OpenTTD sarjassa ja peli on myöskin vaikeampi kuin OpenTTD peli.Tästä syystä en voi täysin suositella peliä, sillä kun OpenTTD on ilmainen ja kaikilta muultaosin paremmin tehty ja toteutettu, myös peliä kehitetään edelleen.50/50 suositteluni. :3			"

												I loved this game back when I was younger. It was one of my very first games I ever played on the computer! When I saw it had come out on steam I couldn't wait to play it again. It's even more fun playing it now than it was when I was younger, because now I understand more of the game's mechanics. But even as a kid I was easily able to create and manage my huge transport company! This game is well worth the price in my opinion. The outdated graphics may be an issue to some people. In my opinion the game looks very nice for its age, and doesn't bother me in the slightest. I experienced no issues running the game on my Windows 10 laptop, and it has a max resolution of 1280x768 (which for my 1366x768 laptop screen, fits nicely!) The basics of the game are very easy to learn, and within an hour of playing you'll already have 10 or 20 different vehicles. The AI in the game can be a bit challenging to new players, so I would recommend starting out just on your own. There is even a multiplayer component built into this game (which I have yet to try out since I don't have any other friends who own this game), but I can picture having loads of fun competing with a friend to become the top transport business!Overall this game is a must have for people who enjoyed it before. Even if you've never tried it out, I highly recommend you at least try it! (I mean, 2 hours is plenty of time to decide if you don't like the game so you can refund it or whatever). If you're not willing to pay 6 bucks for it, then I'm sure it'll go for at least a dollar or 2 during the big sales. 10/10			"

												I know I have never tried Transport Tycoon before, but I think that this game is quite the good successor, when I first heard of this title at such a young age, I first thought to myself, ""what is this game really all about?"" and when I delve deeper into research, I though to myself ""like wow."" because when I found out that the creator of roller coaster tycoon made this game, I think to myself that this had to be some type of ""tycoon"" game. So after all those years of not being able to play it, I've finally gotten myself to play the demo of this game for the first time ever this year and I was definitely amazed, so I've gotten myself the full game here on steam and the truth is, I'm addicted.

												This was one of my favorite games growing up, but I'm sorry to say it hasn't aged well at all. I can't recommend this version as-is, although mods and fixes might exist to address some of my complaints. Haven't looked. Pros:- ~100 years of transport simulation in North American, British, and Swiss environments. - Scenario editing with decent customizability. You can't write new victory conditions or do anything too incredible, but it gives you full control over the resources available and the map. - Tons of pre-built scenarios of varying difficulty. Cons:- Very limited simulation. You can't set your own prices, so competition is purely a matter of delivery speed and building stations that receive more of the seemingly arbitrary resource outputs. New resources do not develop over time. - Dull early game. Small maps, early starts, and small towns leave very few opportunities for profit and often only a single way of exploiting them. It feels like ""connect everything to everything"" more than anything else. - Stability. Alt-tabbing once is fine. Alt-tabbing a second game always crashes the game. Crashing on its own is hardly uncommon and there's no autosave. - Building controls. It's possible to build two pieces of track that overlap perfectly and don't actually connect, and some types of track can't be built from eachother for seemingly no reason. - Route building controls. Busses and trucks can end up in infinite loops that aren't even logically part of their route. One loop I saw had a bus driving off-road to keep its endless square alive. Trains will ignore stations they've decided are unreachable without telling you. - Terrible random maps. ""North American"" climate resulted in an entirely desert map multiple times. There don't seem to be settings between ""mostly water"" and ""all land"" unless you want mountains. Industries routinely spawn so far from required resources that they're basically unusable. Since I got it on sale and had some nostalgia for it, I don't necessarily regret my purchase, but I can't possibly recommend anyone else buy it.			"

												A port of Transport Tycoon Deluxe for Steam/Windows.   Faithful to the original, with a few items removed.    If you don't want to bother with OpenTTD, or running a dosbox for the original, than this is for you.    Sometimes the colors can go crazy depending when you enter the options menu, but that is easily fixed by restarting (which takes no time at all).			"

												Mediocre (2/4).  The single player is repetitive and you don't learn to play game better as you go along.  There's no guidance on signals or track layout, no historical asides to make the experience immersive.  There are some good ideas underneath but I struggled to recreate any of the prettier networks in the screenshots.  The game just lacks polish.			"

												There is an expression I and my friends sometimes use about old TV shows, games or the like, 'Better in memory'. This definitely describes Locomotion. I really enjoyed Transportation Tycoon when it came out and have great memories of playing it. To a modern me, this remake looks like something from the computer stone age and the interface feels like someone invented the mouse partway through the game's development cycle and added it on as an after thought. If you have tried to go back and play Civ 1 or the original Balder's Gate you know the feeling.The basic idea is that you create rail services between industries and / or cities. You can also add trucking and buses, but they seem to cannibalize passengers and freight from your trains rather than taking them to and from the train station. Later on you can add in airplanes. Your actions will influence cities to grow and evolve over time.This is a game a really wanted to like, but I couldn't play for more than a couple hours. If you enjoy nostalgia or simply like a solid transport / business game and don't mind very dated graphics and a GUI from the 80s, give this game a whirl.Rating: D			"

												I played Trans Tycoon awhile back and I love these kinds of games. But the annoyance and frustration to get started is outrageous. I have done the tutorials and scoured the internet for answers. I have trains randomly stopping and then turning around where they came from for no reason, cargo going to the wrong depots for transport, and depots simply not being supplied with items. I have done everything from increasing the frequency of stops by my transit units but nothing seems to be working. Shame that I really enjoy these kinds of games, but it looks like this game is too bugged and I doubt it will come with much support. A real shame.			"

												This is a negative review for Atari and Digital Rivers, not for Chris Sawyer or Locomotion directly.I have purchased this game for a 3rd time now. I bought the original game on cd long long ago and loved it then. The wife and I played it hotseat. I bought the game again after losing that cd, on the Atari website around 5 years ago. I had recently bought a new computer and the product key they had given, came to me in a website url. I had no record of it and didnt grab a screenshot like I should have. After messaging Atari, they directed me over to Digital Rivers, in a very delayed manner. Digital Rivers had no record of my purchase (or so they say) and I told them I would write this review in spite of the fact. I guess a good review wasnt worth 6 bux to them? If you have any problems with this game, dont expect to be helped in any way. They havent fixed multiplayer and it only seems to work with LAN and is still buggy at that. They made no steam achievments and seem to be a very ""lazy"" company. Other then that, this old classic is still worth 6 bux so long as its going to Chris I guess.			"

												I loved Transport Tycoon and TTD. I was a huge fan of the series. But this... sorry to say that, but Locomotion is terrible mistake. First of all  - Rollercoaster Tycoon's engine. It was not the best idea. Building anything in this game is a mess (for example u can't delete signal lights, u must demolish all the track in this place). And even when you build - nothing works as it should. Trains stopping at random stations, tossing and turning all the time. There's no place for fun... Big dissapointment. It's time to refresh Railroad Tycoon series. Or play Open TTD.			"

												Something went horribly wrong here! Chris Sawyer's original Transport Tycoon was way better. Locomotion, on the other hand, has so many faults and confusing quirks it makes my head spin. Gameplay is completely unintuitive and quickly bogs down into a frustrating mess. The graphics are so poor that you can't tell what the hell you are terraforming. Most likely, in your pursuit to build or modify something, you'll end up accidentally destroying assets that are crucial to the local economy and waste a whole lot of your money in the process. Buses you thought had a very clear route somehow end up going round and round in small circles or to the wrong stations. Roads that look completed, actually aren't. In other words, you can not rely on your own judgement of your final work, no matter which angle you are viewing the map from. I don't want to go into chapter and verse here, but basically this game is about as much fun as reading home insurance policy disclaimers. It's underdeveloped rubbish and best left alone. However, I do recommend the original Transport Tycoon. That one is fun.			"

												The game has a tutorial (it's atrocious) if that's what you want to call it. It doesn't explain much of anything and you have to figure out what you have to do. The first tutorial is supposed to explain to you how to setup a bus route and make money. All it tells you is if you hold the right mouse button down you can scroll around the map. And that's it, nothing else. I sat there for a while waiting, thinking okay what will it tell me next, except there wasn't anything else.The interface is difficult to use. I couldn't figure out what as was. You would think that if you hovered your mouse over a button it would tell you what it does, but it doesn't. So you click and hope for the best.AI pathing is horrible. Example: Built 2 buses , they initially went to their destinations and after that all they did was drive around in circles. Deleted routes (didn't help), deleted both buses, tried again, the buses went to some stops and then got stuck driving around in circles again.I never heard of this game before, now I know why. Played the hell out of Transport Tycoon, was hoping this one would be fun, found out it's utter crap. This is just a cheap knock off of a great game.Got it for a buck 50, still feel ripped off.			"

												While there's a huge nostalgia factor with this game, it's highly enjoyable once you look past some its flaws. The general interface (taken from Rollercoaster Tycoon 2) is somewhat simplistic and user friendly and the graphics are pretty sleek for 2004. Replacing vehicles at a high point in development and expansion is however a significant pain but can be tolerated.  The tutorial levels do cover a good chunk of the gameplay but some of the mechanics aren't fully covered and can be confusing for those not entirely familiar with management games.In conclusion, it's definitely worth a try even if its undeniably flawed in some aspects.

												This game is an old favourite of mine. I first played it in 2005 I think, having a lot of fun in the process. After finding it again on Steam, I tried to use my CD, but I got errors of compatibility. So I bought it and, for 6 U$D, it´s still a very addictive game.My only complaint is that the colours reverse, sometimes automaticaly (I read it is something in the Windows system), always after minimizing the game with the Shift key (that also happened with the CD).You can´t get bored too quickly with the game, since you can make everything, modify the scenarios the way you want and also sabotage your competitors (but what´s the purpose of a game without a competition to defeat).What I would like to see are new scenarios as DLC content (free would be a nice thing), such as zones of Germany, Russia, South America, Asia and other, random scenarios, with their respective transports. I saw lots of mods for trains, aircrafts, ships, airports, train stations etc... for the CD version made by various fans of the game, so it would be a great thing if some of those fans could make new scenarios. To sum up, it´s a fun and addictive game, but lacking in the scenarios department, though you can create your own using the ""Scenario Creator"" tool. Also lacking are several transports, having only a part of the maybe hundreds that could have been included (though it would make the game difficult to run and more expensive).			"

												Childhood game, love it. Music is still one of the best parts and memories. Options available within custom scnearios is plentiful. Love to just sandbox with no competitors and build a massive, fancy transportation networks.			"

												A nostalgic game from years gone by. I spent hundreds of hours playing this game from the, now lost, disc and picked it up as soon as I saw it on Steam. Being a huge fan of Transport Tycoon, this is a natural sequal by the same developer.I continue to recommend this game and Transport Tycoon to friends. 9/10 "

												I loved playing this game when I was younger. Oh the memories...This game teaches you how to create a sucessful transportation company. The game is great despite being old and provides a variety of challenges and you can even make your own. However, I hope there could be a game like this were player companies could compete with other player companies besides computer competitors. This could also be great if player made maps/challenges could be shared with others. The game is still a great classic regardless and I suggest people give it a try.			"

												I remember playing Roller Coaster Tycoon when I was a kid; now, playing Locomotion with those similar graphics is just as fun! This game definitely has its perks, and it's quite tricky to get the hang of when you're pretty bad at strategy. However, I love it, so I'll keep practicing.

												So much nostalgia. I got this game when it first came out in stores as a kid, and it's still one of my favorites. Even when you get tired of it, you can always come back to it for a great experience.  "

												Locomotion is a niche title - I think some Roller Coaster Tycoon fans come to this game expecting a similar experience only to be dissapointed. This is a transport sim - you build railways, airports, and roadways to transport passengers and cargo around a series of predesigned or custom scenarios. The mechanics for supply and demand are very simple, which makes the game very simple to learn and play. The city growth mechanics are similarly simple which makes them feel unrealistic, but somewhat easy to deal with. However, some of the scenarios get very challenging with many competitive rivals fighting you for trade and transport superiority.Pros:+ Very cheap title that will give you dozens of hours of entertainment. I have purchased this game before, and got it again to have it on steam.+ A simple, reliable, no nonsense transport sim. If you want to build random railways or tramways, jump right in. + Quite frankly, in a similar vein to RCT1, the simple gridded map simply works. Newer titles have developed dynamic curves and city growth but lack the simplicity and reliability of an old fashioned grid.+ Neat inflation system over time.+ Soundtrack goes along with the era you are in. Some tracks I like while others are a little irritating.Neutral:+ Graphics are nostalgic but may turn some people off. What you see in the images is what you get.+ Game is great if you love logistics, public transport, company building, and trains. If you don't like these things, you will not like this game.Cons:+ Many have pointed out that the game has copied many ideas from similar games. If you have another go to transport sim, this may not give you any additional entertainment. Like I said previously though, it is a cheap title that works. + Replacing old vehicles in long games is VERY tedious. Some alternate games in the genre have developed solutions to this problem, but you will find this to be a very unenjoyable experience on maps like the 100 year challenge.Overall I would recommend this title, particularly if it is on sale, but only to people who like simulation games that don't necessarily appeal to mainstream audiences, like Cities:Skylines.

												A good game, if not underrated. You manage a transport company with trains, planes, buses, boats, and trucks. The goal depends on the scenario, and there is also a scenario editor allowing you to make your own scenarios. If you'ved played the mobile game Transport Tycoon, then this game plays pretty much the same.Only issue is the color glitch, might be because I'm using Windows 7.			"

												Locomotion is a 13 year old game, but aside from the graphics, it compares favourably to modern games (the few that there are) in the genre.My favorite tycoon game of all time is Railroad Tycoon 3, released a year before Locomotion. Which graphics are better is a matter of taste, I think. What RT3 does better is the economic simulation: RT3 has a large variety of placeable industries and stockmarkets, Locomotion has neither.Then again, Locomtions focus on the ""Transport"" aspect (i.e. Trains, Buses, Trucks, Planes, Ships), is something RC3 does not, and adds a layer of complexity. Both have a great user interface and those familier with Rollercoaster Tycoon 1 and 2 will get the hang of it even quicker.The only modern commercial game that is comparable to Locomotion is Transport Fever (which I haven't and won't get), which was built on Train Fever (which I have got). Train Fever has very nice graphics and I felt it had huge potential but fiddly track-building and a poor UI. Locomotion is, at least in my opinion, the best game of its genre out today. As good as the game is, it still hurts a little to say that for a game thats that old.			"
