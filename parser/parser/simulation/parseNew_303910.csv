												Time of Fury (ToF) is wasteland interactive newest ww2 grand strategy game. Some of you may be familiar with their other tiles, Strategic war Europe, Time of Wrath to name a few. While there are some issue this game seems to fix a lot of the problems with the earlier titles.Basic  Players can choice from  variety of scenarios ranging from the fall of Poland, the invasion of France, a grand campaign and many others. Turns are a week long and each scenario has different lengths. Players can then choose which countries they wish to control, both major and minor countries can be controled and players can control as many as they feel they can handle.UnitsThe game has Infantry, Mechanized troops, armor airborne fighter, tactical bombers, strategic bombers and a variety of navel units. Players can conduct research in the varies units and develop stronger better versions (more attack power). When purchasing a unity players select the unit type, the size (corps or army) and the level (1-4 depending on what they already have unlocked. The price and time before deployment will change based on the player selections.Diplomacy   There are diplomacy options but it is the basic, convince a future ally to join sooner or an enemy to join later; over throw a government or if your nation allows hold elections in your own country.Navy   Navy action is simple and basic. You build a fleet and send it to a sea zone. You set the fleet to be either regular (attack enemy fleets) or raider (attack enemy conveys). The computer will randomly decide when there are navel engagements which will take place between the last plaer turn and the first player turn.What has changed since other Wasteland titles        Well first the interface seems much more user friendlyYou also have an increased number of options during the game. For example when Belgium do the French arm the retreating survivors  (add a unit but loss production points) or do they send them on their way. The Germans also have the option to actively look for volunteers for the army or simply stay with recruitment stationsThe bad There are two minor issues with wasteland games.1. Multiplayer is PBEM (NOTE there is hotseat play at the same computer). Now this is an old system and some may feel it is outdated. With a campaign being over 400 turns I doubt many people are going to have the time to sit and play very long in a single seating. So while I do not see it is a problem some people may have issue.2. Game balance    The developers choose to create a more open world than historical acute one. What I mean by that is that it is possible for Romania to have tanks more advanced than the Russians.  There is still no way Romania alone could beat Russia but they may not have the crappy units they had in real life  One other thing with balance, and what I do not understand, is that Russia will not see the economic and military boost after Stalingrad there are no reserve from Siberia coming and it is doubtful the Russian army will ever see the number increase in troops they did in real life.  Final thoughts   ToW is not a bad game, and it is clear Wasteland learned from their mistakes. Sure it has some issues but most are minor and do not take away the enjoyment of the game. Some people will say 'The graphics look old"" well these types of games are not about graphics but the play experience.So if you looking for a decent strategy game with a good bit of depth, but not as deep as hearts of Iron I say give ToW a try.

												Excellent game of WWII grand strategy.This is a sequel to Time of Wrath, which I did not play, and they did make another game called strategic war in Europe, which is a game that can be played much faster and its not as detailed as this game.  There is also storm over the pacific which I also own, and its also an excellent game covering the Pacific theater.What I like about this game is there is enough detail to feel like I have lots of control over my nation, but not so much detail that I just give up trying to play it.  I have enjoyed games like Hearts of Iron II, and Decisive Campaigns Case Blue.  However HOI III was too much, and so games like war in the East and Gary Grisby's other games were just too much for me, as much as I wanted to like those games.This one though, its just perfect.  FIghting as the Russians against Germany for over a year and a half in my second attempt has been excellent.  I had to change the difficulty to very easy, and Im still struggling to hold on to Leningrad in June of 1942.  There is a thrust toward Stalingrad, and a new one going toward Moscow which will be tough to contain.  This game is fun and challenging for both new wargamers and veterans like me.The graphics have many options, so you can adjust the map and the units to achive the look that you want.  I think the screen shot of the graphics and my belief that the game would be too simple and have poor AI is what kept me away from these games.  Don't let that stop you.The only caveat is that Wasteland games does not give the best support.  I had trouble with Storm over the Pacific and fortunately I had purchased the game from Matrix, who has awesome technical support.  They helped me find a solution to the game crashing all the time.  However, I have had only one crash and one other techical problem with Time of Fury, and both problems were fixed with a reload.  I guess if I had a real serioius problem I might have to buy the game again trhough Matrix.  So that is the one caveat, the support is really poor.  Which is a shame, because they have an awesome system for war games.  Heck I just bought the 1953 Nato vs Warsaw pact game, even though its incomplete in terms of balancing and pictures for all the units.  And again, the knock on that game which is in early access limbo is that its not getting any support.  So come on Wasteland, support your awesome strategy games.			"

												Time of Fury's graphics are dated. There's no two ways about it; however, the gameplay is solid. If you were one of those grognards who remembers hunching over a tabletop covered with a hexmap littered with counters, this is a gem. Know what you are getting into. This is one of those kinds of games. There is no realtime clock running or blow up tactical battlefield to play with. Instead players are treated to making hard decisions about where to invest limited resources and how to achieve victory, constrained by the same.I've enjoyed it immensely and highly recommend Time of Fury.

												This game will only appeal to certain people, and that's okay, we're all different and we like different things. Like any game it has its frustrating features. Overall, though, if you like exploring big picture WW2 strategy, this game is for you and allows you to make certain tweaks if you want an edge or a handicap in certain situations. The diplomacy and research elements are quite rudimentary, but the game's main focus is on operational strategy and in my opinion you can have quite a bit of fun with this aspect. If you're a FPS fanatic, or into RTS and brilliant graphics TOF may not be for you, but if you like good strategy and have enough patience to work out the flow of this game you'll get some rewarding play time out it.

												NOT Recommended!I tried USSR on Very Easy which meant I have DOUBLE production points. I have to build level 1 units, strength 3 infantry and strength 6 tanks. AI Germany has strength 11 infantry and strength 32 tanks .... in Nov 1940.Also, once again the Axis do not attack Yugoslavia, so Germany breaks the non-aggression treaty and declares war on me in ... Nov 1940? This is a very clunky game. Graphics are almost CGA 1980's quality. So what, but still. Also there are a few bugs, such as unit upkeep is wrong for large armies sometimes and the events file shows a scrpit for your nation (does not show your decision, just some programming script non-sense.)Oh, and one crash for my frist game after 2 hours. Second game went almost 6 hours and I made it from Sep 1, 1939 to Nov 24, 1940.Anyway, games like this should be better. Germany should not be attacking the USSR 7 months early. That is dead wrong.There is almost no information on how to play or how things work. Also, the AI takes Forever to take its turn. This game had potential but Clash of Steel from early 1990's plays better than this. Way better.I have been playing WWII computer games since they were invented (yep, I am OLD), and I recommend Stay Away From This Game! Total waste of time.WIN 7			"

												In theory an awesome game, very reminiscent of boardgames like Advanced Third Reich or World in Flames. Sadly the upkeep system has a severe bug where bigger countries pay far too much upkeep for units after loading a saved game. Sounds easy enough to fix, but sadly the company who made this game didn't bother to fix the problem for at least the last 2 years, if not more ( http://www.matrixgames.com/forums/tm.asp?m=3659990 ).

												I own all the Wasteland games and quite a few Slitherine games.  I found this game to be good if you can get it on sale or in a bundle.  Just complicated enough to deliver a good challenge but not as complicated as WITE etc.If they would only further support their products alot of their games could be really good.2.5 out 5 stars, buy it on a good sale 3.5 / 5 stars.

Posted: July 19, 2014
												Hello guys and thanks for reading.I picked up this game since he was nice, old school grapich and a whole map with hexes.I thinked this was a good title by some screenshots and the only one gameplay video i have found on youtube.The idea is good, i like the grapich and he doenst need too much to pass from turn to turn, also i like the possibility to change style of the geomap ( You can have normal style of the map, style with nato grapich or even WW2 era or just landscapes and forests ).Also the tutorial section is incomplete, he crashes and doesnt give total explaination to what to do, what the various actions do and his missing some features you need to discover by youself.But the game itself is incompleted and his missing a lot of features wich some games like Hearts of Iron, Victoria 2 or other similar titles give you the possibility.For example, you cant upgrade your hexes, but you only have some already upgraded hexes with trenches, fortifications, cities, industrial complexes and soo on but you dont have any idea what they do ( I presume some buildings on the map are industrial hexes since of the sprites they use, but the game doesnt show you any pop-up and even uising the HEX info doesnt tell you what building it is ), the fortifications are already placed and you cant change them, upgrade them or build other fortifications somewhere else this is really annoying also you cant build or upgrade your nation  Industrial Capacity, its already predeterminated and sometimes he doesnt go up ( I played with germany for 1 hour and i started with 64 IP and he stayed like this for a while, only time i got more CP was after an event wich he told me to spend 25 IC or use 25 IC to build a ship ), i tried also to play with Russia, this time i got 26 industrial capability each turn but he was useless, buying units and used for technological advance what else? Also for nuclear bomb you need 3000 or even 6000 to research and after that build them, good luck getting it withtout the possibility to upgrade your IP.Also the airplanes are ok for now, fighters prevents sometimes on their range zone enemy bombing runs, enemy recons and enemy carpet bombing. But i dont get why airplanes can be REBASED or POSITIONED in random exes withtout an airfield, this seems a bit stupid in my opinion why i can place my Stuka or my Spitfighter anyware on the map withtout the care to use a city or to build an airport?Also the diplomacy for what i have seen now its useless, he doesnt show up, to do most actions you need 200+ diplomatic point wich are revolutioning with a chance to fail or to make a pressure on another nation ( Like make italy joining your axis alliance or make USA hate the Allies more ) but you dont get that much, the agreements are 3 and you cant make anything else, also no spying included. The Tutorial is missing this also.Naval warfare is maybe ok, basicaly you just move your fleet in any sea you want and give him the orders to fight any incoming fleet / Convoy or to avoid anything. When they engage you have random turns going from 1 to 3 to make actions, but lf you have a fleet of 10 ships and you have 1 turn you can only make to move one of your ships or to fire one time, this also applies to the enemy wich can also try to retreat his fleet with a chance, in case of failure he loses his turn, also sometimes when the turns are 3 you can only fire once or move once and then you can press ""Next Move"" button but he doesnt do nothing and the enemy can still do actions.Sometimes the unit pathing its a mess, you can move to marshes, forestes for 1 AP with an infantry unit and still attacking somebody, but you cant move trought railroads you captured, lf you move sometimes your units for random reasons they get FREEZED for 20 turns withtout explainations or why they get stuck near cities you have captures totaly free or even in random Hexes. The attack of ground unit is ok, but i find stupid you can reinforce units who are directly at the front by just buying reinforcments with your IP ( Industrial Power / Points ) and losing the turn by doing it, but lf an infantry unit is inside a city and you keep doing that hes almost unstopable even lf his attacked by 4 panzer divisions with 2 infantry army support and with airstrikes, also you dont have the capability to use artillery battlegroup or artillery battalions to barrage the enemy positions, this is another stupid thing i dont like the infantry have setted amount of Artillery / Anti Tank / Anti Aircraft guns already created for them. Sometimes also to attacking you can lose the turn, the attacking system is a mess, you basicaly click your unit, click enemy unit and then click again but lf you want to make a multiple attack you need to click your unit, enemy unit, another unit near then click another unit but lf you click another unit withtout moves you lose everything and you need to make it again just sometimes the same units who cant join a cordinate attack they can attack anyway alone for no reasons.For me the game is not fun, nothing special just a mess of things put together dispate they say ""Its somenthing innovative blablablabla"" Is not worth 20 dollars ( i paid 20 euros for this, also same price in russia ), he costs the double then buying it on MATRIX GAMES, wich is a totaly WTF.Also thanks for 9% DiscountThanks for reading and sorry for my english, but is not my main language.

												This is a game for hardcore wargamers.It is like Panzer general end Hearts of Iron had a love child, you get the features of both: scaling the turn based Panzer general to a much higher strategic level like that of HoI with a simplification of hearts of iron features when it comes to managing your country like diplomacy, economy, managing leadership etc.The downside is that you have many many many units which all need management making it tedious and makes the AI overburdened which takes long turns to calculate. This could make you feel bored if you are not into the genre enough, for hardcore wargamers who always need more wargames this is a must have though 8/10			"

												First I'm an old timer and was raised on Avalon Hill board games. This game is a throwback to paper chits and paper maps. From that standpoint it plays very much like those old board games. There are some problems though...1) Russia can not be knocked out except by removing every unit and town.2) Allies must be micro managed or they are useless.3) In general the game in campain mode takes far to long (80 plus hours)4) You have to play against other humans as the AI is not good.I don't want to give this a bad review as I loved the old board games, but second thought should be given as to its purchase.
