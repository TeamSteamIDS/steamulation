												Crusader Kings 2 is a complex grand strategy game.  The most complicated game I've ever played. Be prepared to spend hours and I mean hours confused as hell, looking at youtube, the wiki and forums.   Once it clicks though, it's awesome.  Not for everyone, but its kinda like playing through 'real life' Game of Thrones (there's a game of thrones mod too). You control a land owning character starting on any date between 1066 and 1453 AD (The Old Gods DLC will push this starting date back to 867 if you wish).  You can start as a powerful emperor or a lowly count.  The map you play on is more or less Europe stretching into parts of Asia and Africa.  Your sole goal in the game is to keep your bloodline going (and I believe holding land).  Other than that, there isn't a win screen, there aren't defined goals, its open ended, you play until 1453AD and then the game ends (save exportable to Europa Universalis 4 to continue your game with the purchase of a DLC).  You get a 'score', but that is just a rough estimate on how prestigious and pious your bloodline was.  It's quite possible to have 400 years of super rewarding gameplay without getting a high score.  This is a trend you will see me developing on and is a big part of what makes CKII so awesome.That's kinda hard to grasp, but it is less awkward than it sounds.  The goals sort of present themselves naturally.  You don't often sit there with no idea what to do (again, once you understand the game), you kind of always have something you're working towards.  For a first time player this is usually just become as powerful as possible, i.e. aquire land, become a king, then become an emperor and expand your empire.  If you're an advanced player you can set your own crazy goals, roleplay, or do other things to spice up the game.The game runs in 'real time', with a day going by a few times a minute on normal speed.  You can fast forward and pause.  Most of the time you will indeed be going through various menus.  Arranging marriages, keeping tabs on powerful families, plotting assinations, acquiring territory through political shennigans, keeping your subjects happy, bringing in powerful characters to tutor the children of the realm and hold office, and much more.  You can micromanage to your hearts content, play a more hands off style, or switch between the two.When combat breaks out, it is done by moving stacks of armys around the campaign map, meeting an opposing army will cause a battle.  These really just compose of watching numbers go down, and kills go up, so if you're looking for Total War style combat you arent going to get it here.  Don't be fooled though, many times I've been on the edge of my seat watching these numbers change.  The combat system is quiet nuanced as well. To be the most effective you have many things to consider. Terrain bonuses, attrition penalties, appointing competant commanders from your realm, and more add depth.In all I highly recommend this game to anyone who has played something like Civ or Total War and fancy themself a strategy gamer, is looking for a challenege, and has a lot of patience.  This is kinda the next step you can take into something quite a bit more complicated.  That is the path I took into the game am loving it.The game is still actively having expansions and patches developed for it as of the writing of this review 11/25/2013.Full disclosure:  Your reviewer has not quite finished a playthrough yet but am close.  I have 120 hours playtime. I own the dlcs The Old Gods, Legacy of Rome, and the Europa Universalis 4 save converter.  I solely purchased EU4 because of how much I enjoyed my crusader kings 2 game and wanted to continue playing my empire, I haven't even played it yet.Also: Don't buy for full price.  Even though it is worth it, getting the game and all the dlc all at full price is pretty expensive. The base game is often on sale or in bundles.This is my first steam review so if you think this is helpful give the thumbs up and I'll do some more reviews.  Hope you enjoyed reading.			"

												*Update* So good I nominated for an award!Word of warning when buying this, it will will ruin all other strategy games!I was a big Civilization fan and whilst it isn't really far to compare the two (they are wildly different in many ways) going back to something like Civ now seems like a huge leap back in terms of depth. The politics, emergent story and shear possibility of genuine scheming in Crusader Kings 2 make other dilpomacy games almost a joke. Once you've conspired to kill a duke with the help of his wife and the hope of triggering a civil war to potentially swing in the favour of your first born heir as your final legacy, nothing will offer the same devious pleasure in other games.By all means try the demo, but don't be scared off by the amount of information. Whilst great, the interface is certainly intimidating at first, but the tool tips are excellently written for just about every button. Just take your time and don't worry about losing to much at first, just mess around and it will soon come to you. This is the type of game that makes you want to write down your stories just to share with other people. Like that time I murdered my own inbred daughter because she was in a plot with my uncle to kill me! Beat that!			"

												At the age of 16, my character developed a mad crush on a local girl. He crept into her room and banged her, then declared he loved her. 9 months later she gave birth to a child, he decided he didn't like it, smothered this child in its crib, pushed his lover off a balcony and then married a horny Greek princess and did it all over again until he commited suicide at the age of 72 because his son turned gay after coming back from a visit to Constantinople.

												With 400 hours played, my biggest hope is that they stop releasing new DLC so that I can stop buying it.The game is certainly not for everybody, and as above the amount of DLC can be intimidating.  But if you enjoy the thought of creating a dynasty and playing it throughout history then this might be the game for you.			"

												I am sussex, one county in england at the 769 start.I realize I picked a bad start, and need to get land fast. so I took over kent, the de jure duchy.I am now the duke of Kent, but am stuck with mercia, wessex, and northumbria. so I decide to take those too.I am now the king of England. Unfortunately, ireland and scotland seem to hate things that aren't celtic and think they can attack me at will. so I take them over.I am content with staying on the empire of Britannia and never expanding as that brings trouble. except the vikings think they can constantly spam raids on me. so I take over all of scandinavia to stop the germanics.now that I am no longer surrounded by long boats, I can finally rest...and then the muslims invaded aquataine. realizing how screwed I am if the muslims manage to take france and germany, I proceed to commit genocide across the iberian peninsula to ensure christian safety. I can now finally stop conquering...until I notice that africa is only made of muslims since the shia took over mali. so to make sure that I don't get steam rolled later, I take them over too...I finally stop conquering for 50 years... until the mad emperor decides that he wants jerusalem, france, germany, italy and middle francia. so he conquers them all and eventually dies from a combination of stress, depression, and a wound.good thing that his genius son managed to keep the empire from being broken apart from all the lords who just don't like the Haesting family. unfortantely, I lose jersualem from every single muslim joining the jihad. but thats okay, I pushed into egypt and took control of the byzantine empire.The caliphate must have realized what I was planning, for 30 years after the fall of jerusalem he thought he could take anotolia. Neither he nor I expeceted the christianized mongolians helping me. I keep anatolia and eventually take back jerusalem.on May 30th, 1350, I was crowned Roman Emperor and given the nickname 'the glorious'.EDIT: At 820 hours, I have finally beaten my first ironman game. This game lasts far too long if you start at the 769 date since the game lags bad at the end.			"

												Easily one of the best games I've had the fortune of playing. A grand stragey, which rather than being abstracted out to the extent of Civ or Europa Universalis, allows you to take on the role of a head of state (or, head of county or duchy) and do essentially what you like. Want to conquer Britain? Do it! Want to sit as a count for 400 years? Do it! Want to overthrow the Holy Roman Empire? Well... Good luck.Although the core game only allows Christian rulers (thanks ahyangyi!)  to be played, Sword of Islam adds Islamic groups, The Republic adds republics, The Old Gods adds Pagans and Sons of Abraham adds the Jewish kingdom. Each provides a new style of gameplay, distinct from the others.Grand strategy at its finest, though frustratingly hard at times.			"

												I bought this game in a Humble Bundle package and activated it on May 14th of 2015. In the 566 days since that day, according to Steam, I have logged 1310 hours in this game. This means that 9.6% of my life since adding this game to my Steam library has been playing Crusader Kings 2. If you adjust to exclude 7 hours of sleep per day, 13.6% CK2 time. If you adjust to exclude a 40 hour work week, this figures to 20.5%.Since installing this game, it has occupied one fifth of my waking non-work life.These are all facts. Hard, sobering, mathematical facts. Some day, if I stop playing CK2, perhaps I will reflect upon these facts. But until then, I'll be conquering the world.			"

I got on the throne just 14 years old and I will probably rule it a long time.Day 4, I am still on the throne and now i am now 70 years old. A lot things happened and United Kingdom is now under viking Banner and I am still a bit short of forming the wendish empire. It's Already midnight here so a new day will start.Day 5, It's pass mid night and i will play until i pass the throne to my son. as 70 I will need to slow down and manage my titles, county and Duchy well. Time to be a bit ruthless tyrant and once I die all bad behavior will be washed away.PSSSSttt.. I am now 83 years old.. Why won't i die? All the vassal are extramly unhappy with me taking duchy, Banish overpowered lord. I had to bribe people regulary. Murder over powerful faction member. And forget about Fabricate Claims I need it to keep my subject happy. MAARARAFDAAS... I am now 93 years old.. I accepted the fact that i won't die anytime soon And it's 5:30 in the morning already.

Product received for free
												So I think it's about that time when I actually review this game. I've played it off steam for more than 300 hours and about 1500 hours on steam, so it's fair to say I've experienced just about all the bugs, highs and lows, DLCs' and changes to the game's mechanics through the never-ending patches on Paradox' end. I will preface this by saying I'm a history nerd and a complete and utter sucker for the medieval era. I'm a nostalgic dreamer who always used to dream about a game that was dynasty (family) focused, as opposed to the total warfare/dominate the universe-type game. So when I got this game as a gift, it was like someone had created the game for me. It's my go to when I just want to pass time and see whatever my Swedish countess or Scottish duke are up to. The level of micromanagement is ridiculous. I love it. But it's borderline insane. Go through the tutorials of the game, and you'll find yourself lost with a sensation of you might know what you did wrong. Don't go through the tutorials, and you might as well be trying to fill in for Slash at a concert, when the most experience you've had playing a guitar was looking at a banjo through a shop's window. It's intense. In the beginning I lost whole countries to distant relatives in other countries and was scratching my head, but eventually I got the hang of it. I think everyone can play this game, but you have to be prepared to put in a lot of effort and willingness to learn its mechanics. And then after that, there are lesser things to learn, such as your wife trying to kill you because you had a sweet dalliance with her sister. Or perhaps the fact that leading your own troops could result in the unfortunate event of you losing your life, and your 3-year old, imbecilic son inheriting your entire kingdom. There's always more to learn, no matter how much you play this game - its excitement will last you a long time. I love this game because of its neverending possibility for replayability. No game will ever be the same. You can customize your characters with an inexpensive DLC (get the DLCs - at least ""The old Gods"" and a few more. They add so much to the game), and you can create the basis of your new game with a new objective. The word sandbox is key, because in this world, you are not only the lord of your demesne, but of your own fate. Do you want to take that neighbouring county? Or do you just want to keep your family strong and safe, provide good husbands for your daughters? Maybe your king has been getting on your nerves and you want to gather allies and usurp his throne? This medieval world is all yours - if you have the gold, skill and time. On the downside of things, I think CK2 is worth €40, but for a four-year old game it's on the steeper side. It's frequently on sale though. Add it to your wishlist and wait; you can snatch it up for a fraction of its original price. I've enjoyed this game so much and had so many angry, funny and downright amazing moments. Wars I thought I'd lose have turned and I've won entire kingdoms. I've romanced my way through entire courts to get women to join my plots to kill people. The level of intrigue, surprises, horrors, joys and entertaining moments are endless. Oh, and...I seduced the pope once. As a gay king. 10/10.			"

												Crusader Kings II is in my opinion one of the best strategy games out there. Do you like medieval times? Times when you could call your vassals forth and fight against the invader? Or against an ally? Your brother? Your sister? Your cat? Then shut up and give them money!You can play as the brutal vikings and sack the coastal regions, or an Irish nobleman who wants to reunify the broken country, or a republic? Do you want to be the prince of Persia? Ok jokes on the side, additional content has been recently announced, the game is constantly being updated by the devs, and they are truly working hard on it. You have a save file converter to continue the adventures of your dinasty on EUIV, another grand strategy game. Start out small, and try to make your family name shine! You can even customize your rulerz (an additional dlc though). Yes this is a fanboy review.			"

												My friend and I decided to play a multiplayer game of Crusader Kings II earlier. Never in my life have I ever been more frightened in a video game. Let me explain.My friend and I decided to be counts in different kingdoms and empires. My character was a little interesting.First Name: 12Last Name: ISISGoal: Spread my ""seed"" to all corners of the worldLocation: EnglandRank: Count of KentI had set the goal of spreading my ""seed"" all over the world because I thought it would make for some interesting gameplay, and boy did something interesting happen.The game started off normal, my friend was in the Holy Roman Empire as a Duke, and I was in the nearby province of Kent in England, not far from the border of the Holy Roman Empire so we were both well within diplomatic range. I started to spread my ""seed"" by seducing as many women as I could. I tended to seduce the women who had high rankings, such as the Empress of the Holy Roman Empire, the Queen of England, Queen of France, and other higher ranking women. My fertility was well above average, and basically any woman I seduced would have a child.After a couple of decades having passed, my friend had become Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, and I spread my seed to almost every major kingdom and empire in diplomatic range (little did my friend know, he was actually playing as my illegitimate child that I had with the Empress of the Holy Roman Empire). You could always tell which children were mine based on their names. Most of my children had the most ridiculous names like, ""THANKS OBAMA"" or ""Nigerian Prince Simulator"". But, there was one child I had that would cause a lot of problems for everyone. His name was ""Forgot the Condom"".""Forgot the Condom"" was a normal child at first. He grew up till the age of 6 relatively normal, but then something went horribly wrong. While trying to seduce more women, I got a notification in the game. This is essentially what the notification said: ""My son 'Forgot the Condom' is not like other children. He does not scream or cry or even get upset, but he observes the world with keen interest. This morning, he burst into bubbling laughter when a cook cut his hand badly and there was blood everywhere. Animals do not like him and he makes a strange buzzing sound when near other children. Courtiers whisper 'demon spawn' and the servants have started to avert their eyes and make covert signs to ward off evil."" After telling my friend about the event (he had a lot more experience in the game than me), he immediately mentioned that I should stop whatever I was doing and kill my child. My friend exact words were, ""Your son is a demon, you have to kill him or it will be too late.""""Too late?"" I asked. My friend remained silent. At the time, the only way to kill your own child was to imprision them and execute them. So, I decided I would try to do that. Well, whenever I tried to imprison ""Forgot the Condom"", he ended up escaping and fleeing the country. I explain this to my friend and he tells me, ""We have to kill him, somehow."" At the time, neither my friend nor I knew about the character search tool in the game, so we had to manually find ""Forgot the Condom"" in all of the provinces. We looked for 30 minutes, and could not find him. After we finished searching, we decided to continue with the game as normal. ""Let's just hope nothing bad happens"", my friend exclaimed.Five years pass, and I get a notification. It reads: ""My dear daughter 'SWAGYOLO420NOSCOPE"" must have suffered a stroke in her sleep last night. She was found drooling in bed, one eye bloodshot, mumbling about a small monster that stabbed her in the eye before it ran off. There are dark rumours about the so called 'demon child', my son 'Forgot the Condom', again... As always when something terrible happens, she does seem inordinately happy."" I thought we had been rid of ""Forgot the Condom"", but he was back, with a vengeance.I tried finding ""Forgot the Condom"" again in all of the provinces near me, but I could not find him.Another year passes, my son ""URLUCKYIDIDNTABORTU"" dies. Then my daughter, ""6 Salads"" dies. My son, ""Taco Tuesday"" dies. At this point I realized, ""Forgot the Condom"" is killing all of my children. I entirely dedicated to finding and killing him. I'm looking around for him, and he is killing all of my children. We look for him for 2 years in game, when my friend says something.""HOLY ♥♥♥♥, I FOUND HIM!""""WHAT WHAT, WHERE IS HE?"" I ask.""Holy ♥♥♥♥, he.... he""""What? What's wrong?""""He is the ♥♥♥♥ING POPE.""I immediately check to see if he is right. My son... my son, ""Forgot the Condom"" is the ♥♥♥♥ing Pope. My friend and I start to freak out, ""How the hell did he become the Pope?!?!"" ""What do we do?"" ""HOW DID WE NOT NOTICE THIS BEFORE?!?!?!""Immediately we start a plot to kill ""Forgot the Condom"". We have to kill him before it's too late. We have to kill him before it's too late. We have to kill him before it's too late.We had 167% plot power, we were going to kill him, but then the worst thing happen. I get a notification: ""My dear son 'Ebola Paitent 0' has died."" So, what is so special about Ebola Paitent 0? Well, Ebola Paitent 0 was the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, aka my friend. My demon child ""Forgot the Condom"" killed my friend. At this point in the game, the entirety of my children and lineage, the ISIS family line, had been completely wiped out. Except for one person, except for me, ""12, 12 of the family ISIS"". I could no longer kill my son because you cannot plot against your children, I was stuck. I had no where to go. I was going to die, the ISIS family line was going to die. I struggled to find any way to kill the Pope, my friend could not start a plot because his new character was a child. We had nowhere to turn. We were out of options.Eventually, the worst came, ""Forgot the Condom"" killed me in my sleep. I was dead, the legendary ""12 of ISIS"" was dead.The game ended. I had no heirs, and I was eliminated from the game. The game was also hosted by me so it ended for my friend as well.""WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ was that?"" my friend said. I didn't even say anything. A few minutes pass, we were staring at the defeat screen the entire time.""We must remember this in some way."" I explained. ""We must remember '12 of ISIS' and 'Forgot the Condom'. We need to memoralize them forever."" ""How do we do that?"" my friend asks.""I don't know, but we must remember them. They are legends and must never be forgotten.""TL; DR The game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.			"

 Everything You Need To Know  (She just want to smoke and create the definitive review for CK2, I said, ""Girl, that's all that we do."")  That Good Good  Good News:  The game is great and endlessly replayable. Pros beat the cons. Stop reading this and buy it, nerds.   Good News:   You don't have to force it. If learning the game isn't immediately fun, stop. You're not missing enjoyment later. Good News:   Losing is fun!  History has its eyes on you. Good News:   Winning is fun! There are easy starts for first time players. Cornwall 1066 is great place to hide.. Good News:   The Game of Thrones Mod is proof that life is worth living. Look how lucky we are to be alive right now. Good News:   The Conclave features getting roasted in the negative reviews can now be disabled, mostly.  Good News:   You're smart enough to succeed even if those Conclave features couldn't be disabled. I appreciate you, a lot. Good News:   Civilization is a strategy board game. If you'd prefer a historical rulership sim, this is it. You're home. Good News:   Most of the DLC is unimportant. Plus, it's easier to learn by starting with the base game anyway.  DLC Importance The base game is playing a Christian Crusader King. Most game features cater to them. The Holy Land awaits.DLC releases are accompanied by free updates, so the current base game alone is still better than the base game at launchDLC rulers (Indians/etc) are advanced variations on the rulers in the base game. No need to buy them until way later.For example, Vikings are a blast, but only if you can appreciate how they're different from normal kings.You won't enjoy these rulers if you don't at least somewhat enjoy the basic ones, so, again, DLC not a major key upfront.DLC rulers are not needed to play the game as it was intended. They explore playing the game as it was not intended. It's not ""You want to play Super Mario Bros as Luigi? Fifteen bucks.""It's more ""For your 1000th playthrough of Super Mario Bros, would you like to pay to play as the Goomba Caliph?"" DLC Cost Remember, the game had plenty of people hooked before the DLC features existed.Buy the DLC you want over time. I had to do that, they weren't out yet!If you still like the game after 100 hours of play, buy The Old Gods. If you still like it 100 hours later, buy Way of Life and Legacy of Rome.After 300 hours grab Sword of Islam. (And Ruler Designer and Customization if you want to get creative.)Snag Conclave and Charlemagne on hour 400, and then you're done.Buy Way of Life upfront if you want. Or add these DLCs in a different order or at a different rate. It doesn't matter.They're not starter material, they're meant to add a fresh spin on a game you want more of. Game is fantastic, but maybe some of these nitpicks are dealbreakers/I don't know your life/You do you   Bad News:  Tutorial is not helpful. Check YouTube or just feel it out. If your hype dies, stop playing. I stayed hyped. Bad News:  This game's multiplayer isn't good but the real problem is them even putting it in at all. Games can take weeks! Bad News:  Bugs. Enough to make Ironman (where console commands and manual saving are disabled) unappealing. Bad News:  Like other detailed projects (think Skyrim, Fallout), it's gonna crash. Mods turn this up to 11. It's worth it. Bad News:  The combat system is functional but uncomplicated. This is not Total War. Don't push it in that direction. Bad News:  Unlike the rest of the game, ideal army composition is not something you'll figure out by playing. Bad News:   Plenty of names from plenty of languages and zero pronunciation hints. Bad News:  Feudal rulers were not absolute monarchs. This can be difficult. You will be tempted to mod this out. Don't. Bad News:  The Game of Thrones Mod is so damn good. The base game is comparatively lacking in roleplay elements. Bad News:  The Game of Thrones Mod is so damn good, but you're better off waiting until you're a seasoned CK2 veteran. Bad News:  Occasionally, you may feel like you arbitrarily have less control over your character than you should. Bad News: AI is stubborn, impatient, insecure, and can't see the big picture. Bad News:  AI will be equally mad about being harmed and about being denied some extremely unfeasible goal. Bad News:  Your council gets upset at your heir when you die for... not being you. Bad News:  There's an education event where you can make your kid functional if you harm yourself in return. It's never worth it, and ignoring it is impossible because... Bad News:  This event can actually be gamed, as all mentors can receive it. Simply make a rival mentor a kid, then watch him become a inefficient mess. Unfortunately, this can also wreck valuable NPCs or  anyone whoever mentors anyone . Bad News:  AI never considers that the situation they don't like is still their best option. They always prefer change. Bad News:  Loyalty is not measured separately from opinion. The ramifications of this will become obvious the more you play Bad News:  You lose too much control over your children if they're not in your court. Bad News:  Similarly, you have no power to intervene on their behalf if you couldn't do the same if they weren't family. Bad News:  Split custody issues exist but there's no way of predicting some of them and no mechanic for fixing any of them. Bad News: : When you die and become your heir, you're not given context or explanation for what they've been up to, even though you're now them.  Bad News:  Some of your council resigns when your heir takes over, but they don't mind being immediately rehired.... what? Bad News:  Your heirs will sabotage the stability of your realm even thought it will hurt them later when they're in charge. Bad News: Enemy rulers sometimes continue to rule from places you've already conquered, making them uncapturable. Bad News:  No boat combat. Not a big deal, but the cost of getting and maintaining boats is a lot for just a troop transport.  Bad News:  All of inner Africa south of Muslim-held West Africa feels poorly thought out.  Wack Issues   Bad News:  The game map has grown. India will make your game slower even if you never go there.  Bad News:  You're never going to India. Bad News:  Your laptop will heat up. Blame India. The Game of Thrones mod similarly is plagued by Essos. Bad News:  They chose adding India over strengthening the base game. It has no reason to be here. Bad News:  Norse and Muslim rulers are key to Europe, so their expansions helped the base game. India? Not so much. Bad News: : I just don't get why India is in this game. It adds a huge problem for weaker PCs for a minimal payoff. Bad News:  Dealing with raiders becomes an annoying chore if you control many coastal provinces. Bad News:  Adventurers/Rebels (can be disabled) get bizarrely huge armies. You'll understand when you see it. The Wackest Issue (In-game) Costs are laughably expensive and not relative to each other. The different random events where you can spend money on things often require a literal king's ransom. Some mundane costs are equal to a month's income of Europe's largest kingdom. It is frustratingly nonsensical.  Small Issue w/ Bad Vibes The ruler designer, which is a paid add-on, will not let you create an unbalanced character even if you aren't playing in Ironman for Achievements.This is absurd and an actual legitimate DLC grievance. You can futz around with the console to try to fix it, but it's not a perfect solution. Mod fix is available. Vote Dukakis  "

												Just minding my own business down in the little duchy of Serbia when three royal marriages and two feasts later I get a notification that I have inherited the entire kingdom of Denmark. This game, with all of its DLCs for its full potential, is absolutely brilliant in that it brings character customisation and character development to a whole new level. Certainly different from the other Paradox Interactive franchises but in the best way possible. Each Paradox Interactive grand strategy has their own unique focus of gameplay which corresponds accurately to the time period and Crusader Kings II has definitely nailed it with their focus on indepth feudal systems and royal relations. Also I imprisoned all my Danish vassals and watched Denmark plunge into anarchy under my command. 10/10 would usurp title again			"

Incest simulator ?This is the title that many jokingly have given this game on the internet. However this far from what the game is, can you perform incest, yes, however the deepth and dynamics goes far beyond mere incestual relations. Main purpose or goal?You are the head of a dynasty, at the beginning of the game, you can choose which dynasty, and who within that dynasty that you want to play as. Do you want to take control of one of the powerful rulers of the mighty Karling dynasty? Or do you want to repeat history by trying to bring a small count in Switzerland from an obscure family known as Habsburg to their glory, as Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, and spread the Habsburg from there on. With the customize ruler DLC you expand you game a thousandth-fold, you will have to power to not only choose who you want to play as, but you can create you whole new dynasty and ruler. Want a genius hunchback who rules over the Arabian Empire? Do you want to try and backstab your way to the top of the Byzantine Empire with a powerful spy? It is up to you!There is one indicator on how well you have done, that is your Score which the game at the end compare with other great historical dynasties. You increase your score by having rulers with high prestige and piety, but also having other dynasty members in high positions, will generate prestige to your dynasty, giving newborn a higher starting position in life, when it comes to their prestige.There are so many DLCs!Many seem to get overwhelmed by the amount of DLCs this game has, however many of those are cosmetic DLCs, adding other graphics or sounds to the game. The main DLCs that expand gameplay are:I will rank them, with the top being the most important expansion to get first, by my own opinion.Ruler Designer - This will enable you to create your own ruler, only your imagination will limit the replayability of the game.Legacy of Rome - This expansion not only gives more deepth to the Orthodox rulers of the Byzantine, and greek cultures, it also provides new game mechanics, such as military retinues. (Also allow the possibility for castrating and blinding prisoners playing as a ruler of the Byzantine culture group)The Old Gods - This enable you to play the game from 867 CE, and also make Pagans and Zoroastrian rulers playable.Sword of Islam - Makes muslims playable, as The Old Gods each unique religion has its own mechanics.Sons of Abraham - Adds more deepth to the abrahamic faiths and also Judaism. Heresies for religions are also possible.The Republic - Want to try out the merchant life of Venice? With this DLC that will be possible, take control of a patrician family, amass wealth and control the trade zones around the shores of the known world.Charlemagne - Introduces a new starting time, at 769 CE, gives you the option to create custom Kingdoms and Empires.Rajas of India - Allows for control of the Indian rulers. Way of Life - Focus the life of your ruler towards certain areas of his life, want to became a great hunter to catch the fable white bear? Or became the greatest architech in the whole realm?Customization Pack - Customize your ruler ingame, change the beard, hair style, even the dynasty name or shield.Sunset Invasion - If you want to add an extra level of crazy to your game, only recommended for veteran players of CK2, what if the Aztec discovered Europe first? And decided to invade?Save Game converter - If you own Europa Universalis IV and want to continue your saga from CK2, this DLC will enable you to export your CK2 game into EU IV.All the other DLCs are cosmetical.Mods!Crusader Kings 2 has more mods, that will expand your game, one of the more popular mods is a total conversion into a Game of Thrones universe. Where you can encounter spoilers from the series, but it will also make you play out the stories in George R.R. Martin's universe in another direction, should Tyrion Lannister have the Iron Throne? Learning curve?It has a steep learning curve, and the ingame tutorial only scratches the surface of possibilities. I would recommend picking up the game, and play with a friend online, or experiment as a count in Ireland. But when you get a hang on it, it will grab you, and pull you deeper into a world of intrigue, murder, war, romance, and much more. In an forever going struggle for power over the realm, and the world. "

												As a northern Jarl. My ambition was to unify the Northern people, as my father had did before me. I set out and subjecated my neighbours. Soon Norway, Sweden, Denmark and half of Finland was mine. My most favored and ONLY son, a true prodigy of my blood line; did me proud when he said he wanted to service in the Byzantine Varangian Guard.With tears in the back of my throat, my heart beating with pride as I saw the ship sail away to a golden sunset. Many months passed without a word from my son. I had many daughters in his absence. I ruled and I went and conquered the Saxon kingdom. The south was open for the taking.I reccive words after putting down a foolish rebellion. That sails bearing the family standard. A Golden tree on a field of green. I made prepartions in the hall. Odin be praised! My son was finally home! As the doors slams open and a man I bearly recognize as my son steps into the light. He seems ashamed despite my smiles. After the feast, I told him it was time for him to take on a wife and make a family.Dark became the hall when he told me the news of deeds in the Byzantine Varangian Guard. Sleeping with one of the wifes of the Emperor. He had lost his manhood. I had not gotten my son back... but another daughter.I told my housecarls to seize the creature before me and put him in chains. He did not scream nor complain as my men dragged him away. I have to respect him for that.The day came when it was time for blot, so I personally was the one who placed the blade at my former son's throat and made the leathal blow. The Jarls of the Kingdom, seemed pleased at this. But I knew that behind their false smiles that their resentment of me was now higher without an heir. I had only daughters.Who would have known that my sons life was connected to my own. Bloodlines are like trees. Roots are the ancestors, the trunk are you and the branches are the children. Now without the branches my line has come to an end.As I see the army of my wifes brother come over the hills eager to see my head detached from my body, I can only think what will happen to my memory. Will someone remember this bloodline? Or will we fade into oblivion? Even so, I will see my son in Valhalla. And there we will feast with the Aesir. Odin see me!This is my story.What will be yours?This game is worth playing.			"

												If you care about the amount of gameplay you get for your money at all, this game probably rates higher than any other game. (Last I read, the average player had over 500 hours on this game.) Crusader Kings II is a strategic game where you spend most of your time looking at a big map of Europe cut into little counties, but it is drastically different from a game like Medieval II: Total War.  Whereas in those games, every nation had rigid boundaries and an entire nation was a distinct, unified entity, Crusader Kings II focuses upon the feudal system of governance, and especially its hereditary system of succession.You are not a nation, you are an extended family through the ages.  You may start as King of England, but lose the throne in a succession war, only to wind up inheriting the Kingdom of France, instead.  It is a game of political machinations more than warfare.You can't just declare war whenever you want to, you need to, by hook or by crook, manage to get a claim to that land you want to invade.  Battles are relatively quick and hands-off (play that Total War if you want to manage the troops directly) but it's the space between wars that makes the game interesting.  To get that claim, you probably need to find some way to get the princess of that land in your bed (or your son's bed), and it's this medieval bloodline plotting that make up the meat of the game.  For that matter, you don't necessarily need to declare war to gain land - just marry into the family that succeeds a throne, and make sure that, one way or the other, your chosen heir also manages to be the chosen heir of a target kingdom, and the kingdoms will be unified upon the death of your current character and the current king of the target land. Likewise, just because you gain land doesn't mean you can keep it.  You need to delegate land out, and succession laws can fragment your kingdom so much that you see hard-conquered lands slip out of your grasp by inheritence without your consent.  EDIT: And since writing this, Conclave has come out to add complexities to keeping your nobles in line.Worse, while whomever you give land will be quite grateful for the first 20 years of their rule or so, their children will have no gratitude for the gift of land your father gave them, and will likely be burning with ambitions you have to keep in check.  Every few decades, your character ages and dies, and succession wars and civil wars are the primary way the game keeps your over-arching ambitions in check.  Rather than letting a large empire mean that no external threat can challenge you, and no internal threats exist, the larger you become, the less vulnerable you are to external threats, but the more vulnerable you are to internal ones. You spend more and more time trying to find a way to bludgeon the rebellious nobles and religious minorities into line.If you get tired of games of Total War, and don't bother completing them because, once you are the strongest power on the map, there's nothing to do but steamroll everything else that stands in your path, then CK2 is a great remedy to this.  (You can still make a world-spanning super-empire, but it's much more interesting to try to keep it when the owners of that land still fight you when you plant your flag there than to just have them mutely pay taxes to you and have assumed loyalty to your cause.)It's a game that's just hard and realistic enough to make the things you do actually feel like you're thumbing your nose at history.  You can play an Irish earl, rise to High King of Ireland, and conquer England.  Or play as the West Africans, and conquer the Muslims and convert them to your pagan faith.  Being a norse viking that captures the pope and sacrifices him to Odin is always fun.  (And nabs the Holy Smoke! achievement.) And if you do it with an unbroken line of Viking empresses, all the better.Mods are also a high point: Play the Elder Kings mod, based upon the Elder Scrolls, and conquer Cyrodiil and beyond as an immortal or vampire, using magicks to summong hordes of demons when under threat. There's an A Game of Thrones mod, as well, and mods to turn the game into something like a space 4X game.  DLC still comes out for the game, as well.  While more than a little annoying to be nickled and dimed, the trickle of new content keeps the game fresh and new achievements are meaningful challenges, requiring players to take up historic underdogs to rise to glory.  Getting a full board of achievements is extraordinarily difficult, but enjoyable for the challenge they provide.  Compare this to Activision, Ubisoft, or EA, where you buy iterations of the same game every year, and throwing down $10 for another year's worth of life in a game is well worth the price.			"

												I recommend the living ♥♥♥♥ out of this game.Seriously, if you like grand-scale strategy games, but want something with a deeper ""roleplaying"" element in it, this game is right up your alley. Ultimate goal of the game is to advance your familial dynasty to the top of medieval Europe's feudal pecking order through war, diplomacy, subterfuge, and all sorts of other scandalous medieval shenanigans. You play the game through your character, who experiences text-based events occasionally that you, the player, must choose how he reacts to. You will mobilize and lead armies, fall in love, conquer foreign (and-not-so-foreign nations), marry your cousins and breed your children using the power of eugenics to secure your family's power in future generations -- though not necessarially in that order.Fun ♥♥♥♥. 10/10 just like the real medieval times.

												11/10 - Would become Earl Cadoc of Cornwall again.CK2 – The Misfortune Simulator
The Life of Cadoc of CornwallWilliam the Conqueror succeeds in his invasion of England, which is good as Harold was good for nothing. In his wisdom, William decided to create the Duchy of Cornwall and NOT make me the Duke. I remain a lowly Earl.Start plot to assassinate the current Duke of Cornwall, I want that position. Nobody likes me enough to join it. End of plot.The only guy who actually liked me a lot and had great traits, my Chancellor, today died of depression. The only two suitable replacements look more like the living embodiment of the Seven Deadly Sins. I chose one of them with reluctance.My wife is pregnant. Hopefully it'll be a boy!My first daughter, whom is to be my heir, refuses to learn any of my traits. To this day, she remains Ambitious, and only Ambitious.The child is born. It's a girl.And to add the icing on the bitter Cake of Feudal Disappointment, my loving wife died giving birth to said child.Got married again!Wife insisted on becoming a Spymaster. Funny, both my wives have been Spymasters...Treason! Rebellious scum have risen in Cornwall, and I am besieged. According to someone of little importance in my Council, this rebellion only had a 6.5% chance of actually happening. I should buy a ticket for the Great Monarch Lottery.Duke Arsewipe of Cornwall has aided me in removing the rebellious scum that infested my lands. I still hate him.Praise be to God! A plague of Typhus has swept Cornwall. Perhaps Duke Arsewipe shall be given a painful and miserable death.Duke Arsewipe lives...yay.My wife is pregnant, I hope it's a boy. I'm sure the saying goes “Second time lucky”.Apparently the saying goes “Third time lucky”, and I am now the only man in a house of my wife and four daughters.Instead of consoling me, today my Court Chaplain came to me to spread heresy. Naturally, I imprisoned him.My Steward is dead, and there are no candidates to replace him. I now spend a portion of my day keeping the chair warm.Today, I learned that Duke Arsewipe had a previous wife who tragically died of Camp Fever. I'm still unsure as to what the hell kind of name 'Hungifu' is for a woman. Those weird Anglo-Saxons.My wife is once again pregnant. Since this is the 'third time', maybe I will be in luck.My first daughter has married the son of the King of Denmark. We are now far more Prestigious, and Denmark are now my allies.It's a boy! Cador is born!My eldest daughter has given birth to a daughter.My second eldest daughter has just married the son of the King of Navarra. We now have an alliance with Navarra. Duke Arsewipe better look over his shoulder from now on.My niece has asked me to help her find a suitor to marry. Rather concerning is the fact that someone has put my newborn son on the list. I will choose her someone that isn't related. I decided to hold a marvellous feast, with only the finest food. Unfortunately, I only have one guest. The feast went well.Managed to convince my Bishop, whom was formerly my Court Chaplain, to become a Catholic once again. Upon doing so, I released him from prison.I have started a new plot to kill Duke Arsewipe, and with a little (a lot) of coin, I have convinced two others to join me. At last, my enemy shall die!For whatever reason only known to them, my two supporters backed out without telling me. To add insult to injury, Duke Arsewipe had the nerve to ask me to let a member of his family educate one of MY children!Turned 50 today. Happy Birthday to me...yay.Today, my WIFE discovered that my eldest DAUGHTER is planning to kill my only SON and heir. I think my family has finally hit rock bottom.My wife is pregnant...A boy has been born! This is becoming a big family, hopefully they won't murder each other.Alas, sickness murdered my newborn son.It's been twenty years since Duke Arsewipe became duke, and for some reason, he still insists on breathing more life into his wretched soul. I may be older, but I will outlive him!My wife is pregnant...again. I really need to calm down in my old age.It's a boy. The family seems to be evening out a bit now.I have no idea how I do it, but I've managed to get my wife pregnant again. My Court Chaplain insists I stop these so-called “shenanigans”.I am blessed with another son.Duke Arsewipe has stepped over the line now. He has asked me to allow HIM to educate MY son and heir. May the Devil take him!60 today. I insist upon outlasting Duke Arsewipe!My eldest daughter's husband has died at the age of 31, and the circumstances are very suspicious.My son and heir is now married to the princess of the Holy Roman Empire!My half-brother, Dumnarth, died today. He will be greatly missed.Insulted my wife by calling her gluttonous and a monster when it comes to table manners. I shall not be doing that again.It is done. Duke Arsewipe finally had his last breath on August 1st, 1101 at the age of 69. I can now go to my grave a happy man.At the age of 72, Earl Cadoc of Cornwall died after a period of illness on November 2nd, 1103. He succeeded in his goal of outlasting his mortal enemy.

Rest In Peace, Earl Cadoc of Cornwall. "

												I suppose that now that I've logged over 1,000 hours playing Crusader Kings 2 I should carve out a little time to say that this is demonstrably my favorite game of all time (by a factor of five, if you're curious).  There are 16,000 other reviews that will give you more details of what's great and what's not about the game, but let me just add that I have never found a game that better simulates  internal  political conflict within a country.  Think about it: you play most ""great"" strategy games like Civilization, and you'd think that nations were made up of uniform automatons - the worst it gets there is some city riots because you didn't build enough ""Happiness"" buildings.  In CK2 your vassal rulers are individuals, with their individual ambitions and characteristics, and they can be a real pain to manage - sometimes they fight with one another, sometimes they fight with you, and ultimately it's about who's got the most leverage.  The only difference between CK2 politics and modern democratic politics is that ""leverage"" in the 12th century is usually counted in swords; besides that, the backstabbing and intriguing is pretty indistinguishable.  A strong king, just like a strong president, is one who dominates their internal foes so that they can in turn dominate their external ones.That simple innovation is what's made this my all-time favorite game, the one I've been coming back to year after year.  Add to that a dedicated modding community that let's you play out the same internal/external conflict in Game of Thrones, Ancient Rome, or Warhammer, and, well, you've got at least a thousand hours of fun ahead of you.

												Crusader Kings II is an exceptional game in that no other title will make you feel like a ruler as well as it. You're not just a country, like in other grand strategy games. You are a ruler with qualities, flaws, vices and virtues. You can be a Duke who is a brilliant diplomat with a hunchback, an ugly, stuttering dimwit count, or a mastermind plotter/lesbian queen. (I'm NOT making it up). And you can be all that within in a single playthrough, as you re-incarnate into your heir when you die. You have to be good at managing your realm, but you've got to be even better at managing your dynasty by arranging favourable marriages, assassinate pretenders... It's all very involving and requires a lot of micro-management (which you may or may not like).It's not without flaws: the interface could see much improvement and the game starts to slow down when you become powerful. By slow down, I don't mean that your computer has a hard time coping, I mean that there are many more events that require your constant attention, making things move at a slower pace. To be honest, after several hundred hours, I think I'm a bit burned with the game. And that, even though there are entire DLCs I haven't really explored yet: I have only really played as a Catholic or Muslim ruler, but DLCs let you play as pagans, Orthodoxes, republics...And then there are a couple of Mods that are probably worth exploring as well: ""Game of Thrones"" and ""Tamriel"" (from the Elder scrolls series)Still, with so much content and the unbeatable feeling of being an actual Middle-Ages ruler, it's hard to rate CKII anything lower than a 9 out of 10.

												This is a good game.A fantastic game, even. To my knowledge it's never really been done before (besides crusader kings I, obviously)It's incredibly entertaining. You can do some absolutely hilarious thingsIs it worth 40 USD? Of courseDoes it cost 40 USD? Not quiteScroll upSee that 'Downloadable content for this game' section? Click see all.Scroll downYes, 194.49 218.46 USD. That's how much DLC is in this game. Remember all those youtube videos you watched? Remember how fun it looked? I can guarantee you most of the entertaining features you saw in that video are going to cost you at least another 5 USD each. Remember seeing that youtuber raiding england and pillaging all the churches as a viking warrior? 15 USD. Remember seeing them ruling mediterranean trade as the venetian republic? 10 USD. Remember how they conquered all of europe for the caliphate? 10 USD. Remember how they united india under one glorious empire? 15 USD. Remember how they designed their own character to conquer europe with? 5 USD.Remember how not all of the different nationalities looked exactly the same? That's going to cost you another 2 USD per portrait set. Remember how not all of the units looked exactly the same? 2 USD per unit set. Remember all of that different music in the background? That's going to set you back as wellIt's a great gameWould it be worth 40 USD? YesIs it worth 234.48 258.45 USD? No. Not at all. Which is why I couldn't possibly recommend itNow, if there were a way to play the full game without spending hundreds of your hard-earned (insert currency here), then it would be a different story...(EDIT) If you can catch it on a 75% sale like what's on until the 5th of october then that's a solid deal, just know that the 'collection' doesn't include all of the DLCs like you'd be forgiven for assuming			"

												This used to be my favorite game ever. I have hundreds of hours logged into this game. I even loved crusader kings 1. But Paradox has decided to let some no talent idiots take control of the Crusader Kings 2 project. Essentially they have repalced the main development team and the vision of the game has drastically changed. I have almost all the DLC's for this game and have spent quite a bit of money on it and NOW they start ruining it? Instead of giving us new things to conquer or new characters to interact with or new cool things to do they have decided just to make the old things harder and more annoying. Between conclave and the proposed black death dlc the developers are severely limiting game play by injecting annoying, illogical and unrealistic events into the game. People already plotted to rebel and acquire power for themselves but conclave made it easier for them. There were already illnesses that caused quite a bit of devastation in the game so the new DLC is proposed to maximize that already annoying situation. What fun is that going to be?? Well let me tell you it will be about as fun as micromanaging all your vassals is in Conclave. Basically none. The UI and real time mode of game play severely limit micromanagement oppurtunities.I am very unhappy with the direction crusader kings 2 is going with the dlc's and I will no longer be purchasing them. But even that doesn't stop the new jerk developers because they patch in idiotic things like broken retreat into the game whether you like it or not. I have quite a bit of money wrapped up in this game and the jerks have made it unplayable. The developers are so arrogant and foolish they don't even make their stupid new rules optional. This is what happens when you don't allow negative feedback on your forums and fill it with bootlicking yes men. They pretty much ban anybody who makes the slightest criticisms of their games on their forums. Don't believe me go and see. Screw you paradox. No more money for you.			"

												This game together with Europa Universalis 4 has completely ruined almost all other strategy games for me. I used to enjoy Civ 5 and I used to enjoy Total War. However since learning to play EU4/CK2, all I can think of while playing other strategy games is ""Why isn't this game as good as the ♥♥♥♥ Paradox makes?"". The gameplay is so deep and so enjoying with Grand Strategy Games like CK2 that I almost regret picking it up. I sometimes wish I hadn't open Paradox's box of terrors and maybe I could've lived in ignorance and enjoyed Rome 2, Civ and Beyond Earth. But sadly, I did.Beware:Buying this game may ruin all other games in the strategy genre for you.Ignorance is bliss.			"

												Playing virtually any dynasty in this game, big or small, feels like trying to balance on top of a ball on top of another ball. Just when you hit that sweetspot your leader dies, and you fall and have like 30 seconds to have the new guy get up there and figure out how to not lose his balance or else it's game over; or atleast a gut-wrentching downsize.If you bought the game and can't figure it out, play a small dynasty several times through. I've always been interested in Italian history so I played several games as the Duke of Ferrara starting in the late medieval era (1337ad) who controls only two counties. Starting in 1337ad makes it so your technology, baronies, temples and cities are universally well developed, meaning you can concentrate on learning the rules of medieval rulership and how they apply to the game and acheiving your goals for the playthrough. For your own game, try playing as a few different powerful leaders and then as a few weak ones so that you see the difference in player control over your realm.I've now gone back to 867ad Italy, with the Duke of Tuscany, Adelberto Bonifazi. The king of Italy, a foreign invader from the Karling Dynasty of France is leige to the 5 major Italian duchies, and is moderately respected within Italy. Europe is divided from west to east by three different Karling Kings, and the throne of Italy is up for grabs within their house. It makes for fantastic storytelling of italian unification, or fragmentation (which is more consistant with the history books). Find any dynasty that tugs at your fairytale strings and you'll create the adventure yourself. You compile your own ruleset for winning, and you'll play again and again to get it 'just right'. You are allowed to pick and choose from a wonderful list of histrorical characters from the 760's through the 1300's (more with DLC). You might even find yourself on wikipedia learning about how europe, northern africa and western asia used to work. Once you are briefly educated on succession laws, title claimancy, and holy war you'll be well on your way to taking Rome for the Byzantine empire and converting all Christians to Orthodox and thus resolving the great schism, or perhaps you'll begin as a small vassal, in control of a single county and have your progeny expand and reclaim The Holy Roman Empire. Or maybe you'll just want to keep a small duchy in Italy safe from foreign invasion generation after generation and keep your family safe at all costs. It is at its core a sandbox game. You create the goals, you amend them, the world changes drastically, your position changes, there's an opening, the window closes, alliances are broken, new friends arrive at court to save the day, and eventually you forget what the original goal of winning was to begin with. You watch and contribute to the story as generations of genetic triumphs and failures are constantly bickering, warring, dieing, plotting, changing sides for no good reason, and are also generally trying to make sure you don't have a larger army than they do. Don't forget about all the neighbors, who are convinced that they would be better suited to rule in your lands than you are.There are a thousand pitfalls to success in CK2 as there surely were in the more noble times, so always learn from your mistakes and try again. Use google. And always have enough gold to hire an appropriately sized mercenary army and pay them for 12 months. Always. Eight hour playthroughs that fall because of premature spending will remind you of that. Keep your neighbor rulers in the character watch list, keep a constant eye on beneficial marriages, and constantly scan the character find sheet for potential courtiers that would join your court and could serve as councilmembers. Remember that the safety of the family is top priority, so always be able to defend yourself, be it through your own army, your vassals or your alliance's, but never have a substantially smaller force than the neighbors or vassals. That will spell game over. And lastly, please try to remember at all times that those who cannot remember the past are doomed to repeat it.			"

												I will not talk about how Crusader King II compares to other strategy games on the market because it wouldn't be fair to them. You do not compare a Picasso with children drawings from school. Students have to do quick flashy drawings for good grades, and do them as often as they can, with accent on flashy rather than on detail. Crusader Kings II is a game that puts the accent more on detail, quality rather than quantity.The game itelf may feel a bit hard to understand at first, but if you give it a moment of your time, it will surprise you. But buyer be warn, if you just wanna play a game where you plug in, then all you do is fancy easy war TW style, or EUIV, then better avoid CK2. Crusader Kings II requires the player to think, quite a bit actually, and consider choices and plan ahead, sometimes for a few decades. It is a real strategy game, and as such it is a gem, since I do not think there is another game on the market that challenges you truly at this level and in such a complex way.Why is it challenging? Well for one, you need to plan your dynasty, you need to plan your marriages to seek advantages and gains, secure the blood line, be wary of who will you end up playing next, and after that, manage your vassals, manage alliances which can only be made through marriage, manage your holdings so you can have more income and troops, manage your realm to pick laws which will either upset or make your vassals happy, or play nice to your liege if you are not independent, watch over your armies when you raise them, pick terrain carefully as it matters quite a bit, be carefull who you put in charge of your armies, watch over you flanks, be carefull what troops you use when, since the holding they come from gives them bonuses, plan your technological advancements, mind religion, convert, play the cardinal game, expand, go on crusades, plot to murder your enemies, to revoke titles, fabricate claims, and so much more.You think that list is big? Its small, even more so, get a mod from the Paradox Forums, and you can get 2-3 times more features, some mods even take you to other worlds, use maps from settings you know and love and add a ton of events and new features. The ammount of depth this game and its modding community offer is mind boggling. Crusader Kings 2 is the Skyrim of Strategy Games. Its got depth, its got versatility, its got deep modability, its a gem.And trust me, nothing compares to the feel you get, when after starting as a Count, you end up an Emperor for the first time...UPDATE: 2 years and a lot of DLCs later... This game is killing my free time still. To date the most addictive game in my life. I've never spent so much time over so many years on the same game...			"

The day she arrived she was thrown in the dungeon and had to watch as I killed off her co-plotters one by one. Once all the plotters were dead, she had my baby.

												This game has so many different narratives it's amazing, it's essentially a book where you're the author yet you're also the reader. What follows is a pretty epic series of events, I'm not the greatest writer but I love this story.Through much  political intrigue and disease alike, Queen Cumman of Eire (Ireland) sat on the throne. She had four children.Her eldest daughter, Muirne, married a king of Scotland who shortly after died in battle against the English. The king's brother inherited the throne and offered his hand in marriage to Muirne. Her Ambition made the choice for her. Five children later, she died in childbirth at 32. Her youngest daughter, Tuathflaith, was born Ugly and through her upbringing, became Deceitful and Gluttonous. No man desired her and so she resides in her mother's court. Through her many pleas to be married to have a family, Queen Cumman is considering one of her many courtiers for an arranged marriage. Her eldest son, Cathal, the twin of Muirne, was taught as a child by Tressach, the Marshal of Eire, a Brawny man who none could equal in tournaments. He grew up to replace his mentor as Eire's Marshal but not for long. The Queen named him as the Duke of Ulaidh, a territory of four provinces including the county of Ulaidh. Her youngest son, Aedgen, wasn't taught in hand to hand combat yet excelled his siblin on the battlefield as a  Brilliant Strategist. Through his desire for land, the Queen entitled him to the county of Ulaidh, essentially the capital of the duchy of Ulaidh. Cathal had declared independence from his mother to create the Kingdom of Ulaidh, to the Queen's surprise. Although not on his own terms, Aedgen joined him. However their relationship with their mother did not change such was their loving relationships. Years passed and King Cathal became consumed by his power. He was now known as Cathal the Tyrant. Having enough and seeking reformation, Prince Aedgen had declared a revolution against his brother. The timing was perfect as Cathal's troops were abroad in Wales attempting to expand his territory. However he had not anticipated Cathal sending a crow to the Queen of Eire who came to stop the rebellion. She had turned a blind eye to Cathal's method of reign, he was her eldest son and heir after all. Although the Queen was old she was a warrior at heart and so met Aedgen on the battlefield.  The rebellion was destroyed in an instant.King Cathal had thrown his brother in the dungeon for a few years despite his mother's pleas to release him. Eventually Cathal had offered to ransom Aedgen for 46 gold to his mother. A ransom for his brother to his own mother. She accepted immediately although not as fast as she realized King Cathal wasn't the same Cathal she had raised. Previouslly unbenknownst to her, she discovered that he had even renounced the Lord, following instead the cult of Waldensian who were heretics of the Church. Queen Cumman made a heavy decision that very same day. She declared war in the name of not only Christianity or her Kingdom, but for her own family. She had petitioned the King of Scotland (the same one, who had now married one of the Queen's kinswomen) for aid to which they accepted without question. Cathal the Tyrant's men were raised. The Queen ordered only her own men to gather, leaving her vassal's men to defend their territories. The Scottish were rallying but it would take them months to arrive. King Cathal the Tyrant marched from their capital, leading 4300 men, half of which were heavy infantry. He was accompanied by a Waldensian priest. The Queen's men of 4458 also marched. Queen Cumman decied there was only one man who, in every right, should lead her army. Prince Aedgen. Her faithful commanders, Mugron and Tressach (the very same man who mentored Cathal), secured his flanks. The two armies met on the plains in Bréifne. This clash would decide the dynasty of Eire. The battle of Ceann Lios was about to begin.SO this story is unfinished because I just had to write about this in a review. I've literally paused the same just as they're about to fight and I'm about to resolve it xD I was controlling the Queen in all of this but everything else occurred because of the game, nothing is scripted and that's what makes the game so amazing. It's a great strategy. At the time of writing, I've logged 39 hours and I bought this game four days ago D:TLDR : If you like grandy strategy and diplomacy, this game is really for you. You don't get to control anything within a battle when it commences (well you can retreat) but watching the events in the battle screen is equally as thrilling as fights in Total War.			"

												I never played this game before. I bought it on a sale with a hole bunch of what looked like a millian DLCs and had it sitting in my library for quite some time. At some point I decided to pick it up and give it a try. Since I like playing the underdogs I decided I'd try to create a Buddhist World Empire. So I picked some random Buddhist dude on the top right corner of the map, designed a nice flag for him, browsed briefly thru the hair styles and gave him some nice sounding name. And there I was, a new Buddhist Lord in the year of 769. Boy was i confused. So damn much was going on and I didn't understand half of it. I soon found out that I had picked a guy who was the vassal of some other Buddhist lord. It took me about 30 years, but within my first character I was able to marry my lords daughter. My first character did nothing more then that, he just waited until he finally died so his son could take over. After that it was a ever so slowly progression. The more I learned how to play, the better it was. Slowly and steady I extended my new Buddhist Empire, taking over county by county, then losing half of them again to my brother the moment a transition from one leader to his son happened. Rinse and repeat. The bigger I grew, the more I understood the importance of keeping my vassals happy. I tried to adopt. A few times I had to reload because my empire had been torn apart by revolution. It took me about 200 years, until 800 something, until I felt ready to extend to the north. So I slowly took over the Tengri region above me. This worked out fine. I spend some time mixing up the bloodlines, dealing with revolts and stuff, until I finally had something of an stable empire. Now the only way to grow was to the west, into the Arabian empires. I had to reload some times and figure out the best time and approach. I seeded revolutions over there and struck just when they where hit hard by multiple regions braking into independence. This went on for a couple of years, slowly extending county for country into Muslim area. Each time I had conquered a country I did my best to convince the leader to convert to Buddhism, eventually, and very forcefully, spreading the word of the Buddha to the west. By this time I felt pretty confident that I could extend all the way to the Indian regions, where some bits and peaces of Buddhism where still existing. My dream of a big Buddhist World Empire was closer then ever. Boy was I wrong. In the year 1220 a huge army of Mongolian forces arrived and stood all of the sudden right in the power center of my empire. I was, at that time, able to round up a total of almost 11.000 men, a number I had seen increasing over the past 100 years and was incredibly proud of. The Mongols landed with something around between 50.000 and 70.000 men. I gave up fighting withing the first year. I was thrown into prison and most of my direct holdings where taken from me. My Buddhist Empire that I had been so fond of was forcefully integrated into the much larger Mongolian Empire. After some years I was demanded to change my religion to Hindu, which I did with great reluctance. Struggling to survive I tried to marry myself or one of my hires into the Mongolian Empire, but since they where Hindus alone the “Not the same caste” message killed me of. Nether the less I managed to keep my bloodline alive and seed some of them into the Mongolian Empire. I took some of my titles back and could at the very least keep my little Buddhist Kingdom, even thou the Tengri Part was lost for good, since the Khagan himself had inherited that title . I did some attempts of murder, but had no backers and mostly just ended up begin “politely” asked to drop it. I even tried to reclaim the title by force, when I saw a huge stack of 80.000 armies pass thou my land and into India, figuring I might have the time to win this war before they could reach me. I was wrong. So I ended the game as I had started it: a pitiful, meaningless nobody in some little remote state, that had given up his believe and lost every bit of his power to a greater leader.I bow before you, game. I enjoyed every single hour of this almost 60 hour game. I regret nothing. Next time I have so much more I know, I might even not fail as bad. Or even more – who knows. Next I' ll try to conquer the world with some Afrikan Empire...			"

												This is by far the most accessible of the Grand Strategy Games that Paradox has made. A wonderfully convoluted game, where you define your goals and the means to achieve them. Be warned, you learn this game by playing it, gradually blooming into one of the most magnificent machiavellian meanies (darn you, profanity filter) the world has ever seen. Rewrite history as you see fit, Scheme and plot, command armies and then laugh at your demise at the hands of your subjects, your enemies, your supposed friends, your children and the wonderfully cruel winds of change and chance.But be warned, this game does not provide you with a goal aside from survival of your dynasty. Do you wish to unite Ireland and then subjugate the heathens that currently hold Jerusalem? How about bringing forth the downfall of the Holy Roman Empire as just a lowly Count of France? Or maybe you really just want to make that one guy pay who plotted the death of your insane, crippled and infirm Court Jester? Do what you want and suffer the consequences.All in all, this game is ripe with dark humour and seems to be easy at first. But it deceives you, sucking you in and suddenly gripping you by the balls, as you die from consumption, your son gets killed in a crusade and your remaining heir turns out to be gay, possessed and a complete lackwit, all while your allies drag you into wars and your vassals rise up in arms against you.So, laugh at the cruel twists of fate, or grow mad from the revelation. Or maybe just enjoy a quiet, uneventful life as a lowly vassal to better lords.			"

												* Started as a random count in Ireland in the 8th century. * By 800 I had become King of Ireland. * By 1000 I had established the Empire of Britain. * By 1100 I had conquered all of France. * By 1150 I had taken control of all of Italy and crowned myself Holy Roman Emperor. * By 1160, I had launched a war on the Byzantine Empire, won, installed a Catholic on the Byzantine throne and by 1190 the Orthodox Church had been completely eradicated.* By 1200 I had inherited the Byzantine Empire after marrying its Empress, and promptly established myself as the true Roman Emperor. * By the game's end, the Irish Roman Empire controls the entirety of Western Europe and North Africa all the way up to Lithuania, Somalia and Persia, has entirely reversed the Arab conquests and seized control of Mecca and Medina (confining the Muslims to Eastern Arabia and Pakistan), and has even established several trade posts in India, effectively beginning the colonial period several hundred years early. Technology is incredibly advanced, heresies are spreading like wildfire and nobody really seems to care, so effectively the Enlightenment has begun several hundred years early as well. To top it all off, Iceland, the British Isles, most of France, most of North Africa and most of Hungary are now fully Irish.This is just one of the things you can do in this game. Just one.Do I recommend?YES.(Lag gets a bit bad in the late game, apparently because all the Greek characters are using up processing power trying to figure out who they can castrate out of all the characters in the game. Yes, you read that right - the game runs slow because the Greeks are trying to castrate the entire world. Other than that simultaneously annoying and hilarious problem, the game is great!)			"

												I had a Slavic count take my daughter once. To retaliate, I took his wife and two 15 year old daughters. After his daughters ripened, I made them and his wife my concubines. In a fit of rage, I then took over all of Scandinavia. After living to the ripe old age of 101, my character died in battle. Playing as his grand-nephew due to elective, I imprisoned the daughters, wife, and the children my former character had sired on them. After waiting another 7 years, I took the children of the concubines as MY concubines. I eventually had my bloodline ruined due to incest.10/10 would concubine again.			"

												Strangely addictive game.  I had this in my library for a while and never figured out how to really play it until I found a community beginner's guide.  After that, I haven't put it down.Its challenging, fun, but not at all a game you can really get through in an evening.

												I went from a Count to a Duke, got married, had childeren, even managed to marry off my daughter to the 3rd in line to the throne and let her keep her name.Then civil war broke out over the crown between the king and his eldest son, I fought for the king and beat back the forces on all fronts except one ( The king and his army were there, so i assumed they would take care of things )But tragically the king died in battle, which left his heir and recent enemy of the crown to become rightful ruler over the lords and lands in the kingdom, concluding the war and putting me in the bad books for taking his farthers side.I decided to rebel, in hopes of being able to give my son in law and now 2nd in line to the throne the crown.The war waged on for many many years and took it's toll on everyone involved.The kingdom was split in half, the West fighting to rid the evil tyrant and the East fighting back with every thing the crown had, but it was not enough, the king's forces were pushed all the way back to the capitol.I was quick to gather more troops from the few of my vassals that were able to help.These were tough times on the kingdom, after so many years of war the kingdom's financial state was in tatters, the lords  were struggling to keep their provinces under controll while fighting off the mass hordes of troops invading their lands.But i knew the moment we had fought so hard for was close at hand.I launched a seige on the capitol with the few hundred troops i had left, the seige lasted over half a year before my forces managed to break through and begin the assault on the castle.It was a bloodshed, an absolute massacre, the king and all his men and been defeated but not before i had lost over 3/4 of my army in the attack.But the war was over, the new King had taken the throne and peace had come to the land.After all the years the kingdom spent in turmoil, only a couple of faces were familiar from the begining.most of these lords are the sons and descendants of those that rode with me against the prince before he became king.Many of their fathers fell in the war but they continued the fight for them.As the years pass following the over throwing of the old king, The lords and houses fight and conspire against one another but nothing major happens within the realm until the king, my son in law and father of my grandson, becomes ill.Shortly after he passes from his illness, many of the lords start to question my grandsons right to rule.A few small rebellions start over in the far east end of the kingdom.My son, heir to my lands and house, rides east to meet the rebels in battle.he defeats three of the rebellions before lossing the battle and his life at the fourth.With only my grandson to carry on the family name, i try my best to gather enough troops to march over the rebels and stop them from usurping the throne.All my effort is wasted tho as the young king mysteriously dies from causes unknown.I spend last years of my life fighting against the kings that come and go, only to fall victim to a event that causes me to be a paraplegic and die alone and incapable of doing anything.10/10 would feel like it was all for nothing again			"

												One of the best games I've ever played. It looks like a historical strategy game: a large real-world map to play on, countries to control, lands to conquer, etc. But don't be fooled. It is actually a “life simulation game"". You have a country (or part of it), but what you really play is a dynasty, or family. You rule, you fight, you want to see the death of your regent, you kill, you murder, you have parties, you make friends, you meditate, you do business, you love your wife, or make wild loves with your lovers, you have enemies, you are supported by your vessels, you travel around the world, you educate your children, you become the king, you are defeated on the battlefield, you lose your titles, you are nobody again, you are old, you die, you leave nothing but chaos to your sons. You go over the rises and falls of the family, interact with everyone around, and play your particular part in everyone's own story. There are tens of thousands characters in the virtually living world, everyone with his or her own life being written. Sadly you can never have sufficient energy to learn every unique story! This is one of the best games I've ever played, definitely top 5. It depicts every shining and awkward, elegant and wretched moment of a normal medieval noble guy. 12/10Those who give only 11/10, you guys are so mean.			"

												Endless replayability. CKII may take a while to get into, but once you learn about most, if not all game features, you'll find countless things you can do or try to achieve. Story unfolds itself, because while there is no narrative or script, your actions and actions of others really change the world and characters around your dynasty. Vast personal traits and characteristics that every single one character in game can have make up the story, as their actions are mostly defined by the personalities they have.			"

												Quite simply one of the greatest strategy games ever made.From the outset - Crusader Kings is not for everyone. It will be best enjoyed by people who are interested in deep systems and the interplay between them. Those seeking a way to crack the ""optimal"" way to play, and those seeking to ""win"" will be disappointed, whereas those seeking emergent systems and effects will enjoy hundreds of hours of discovery. It is therein that lies CK2's greatest strength - creating a narrative through emergent systems.Crusader Kings II relies largely on the player setting their own goals and then working towards them. Be they immediate goals, medium term aspirations, or long term dreams, a large part of CK2's appeal lies in pondering how best to ""exploit the code"" to reach your ends. In fact, the best way to play CK2 is not to play to win, but to let the game ""happen""; to let your dynasty's fortune ebb and flow with the passage of time, creating a narrative of a family streching across the centuries. Crusader Kings 2 is a game that you can sink literally hundreds of hours into and still find out new and exciting things to do. CK2 isn't a perfect game; the learning curve can be steep, particularly for those new to the genre, and the presentation is a little short of the cutting edge. But, with a fantastic level of developer support, continual free and paid content additions, hundreds of mods, and a lively, friendly and supportive community, it is fair to say that CK2 is one of the greatest strategy games of all time and, for strategy fans, possibly one of the greatest games of all time. For this writer with over 30 years of gaming behind him and hundreds of hours on the game (mostly on the Gamersgate version), it's certainly cracked the Top Ten!			"

												Actually, this is not a grand strategy game, but rather an RPG.When you are about eighty, when your face represents a bloody scar from cancer, when all your kids and your dear husband have deceased in the war or of sickness, even your only friend with whom you were used to play chess has passed away, and when nobody believes that you are able to last another year, but quite the contrary, they begin to reach out their paws for your titles and your collection of pictures, which you have been gathering your whole life –all of a sudden you start writing poetry, retire more and more often to your chamber lost in prayers and reading the Bible, that remained from your father to whom you owe literally everything, and then you catch your second wind, go to victorious war against nearby empire and conquer its capital, undertake a succession law reform on a surge of popular jubilation and become a true leader of the boiling, transforming society;and once during the night walk in the distant abandoned corners of your garden you face a cheeky kitten going to become your new and last friend.

												Below are two versions of my review...  Angry Rant	 I'm tired of all these DLCs and their inflated prices. The content added often brings new depth to the game, but frequently has features that we shouldn't have to pay for. I'm looking at you Ruler designer! Also you dirty portrait, unit and music packs should be ashamed of yourselves for existing! If you look at other game companies, they often give comparable content for free as an update. At the very base of it, I'm sick of all this piece meal DLC. I can understand expansions increasing the longevity of the game, but seriously Horse Lord's cost is 37.5% of the price of the base game. And don't you lie to me and say that any of these expansions add enough content to justify their price. Most of these are just paid unlocks, not anything ""expansive"". Also don't talk to me about steam sales, the most recent releases only get 35% off. For Horse Lords, that's roughly 5 dollars, whoopee do. By the time, we get a substantial ""deal"" on any DLC, it's often way down the line and Paradox has already churned out another one. All of this means two plainly disappointing facts. You'll pay considerably to have a complete and current content version of any Paradox game and that when a new game releases it's evident you're only getting a bare bones version of the eventual game. However, I know that nothing will change as long as people keep apathetically buying the product. And so this 'just another ranting guy on the internet' is going to reach into his wallet, pull out his credit card and buy the next ""grand"" expansion for CK2 because oh well, right?  Slightly More Rational Rant I'd prefer that more game developers learn from CD Projekt. Witcher 3, as an example, has become incredibly successful and it doesn't require a smattering of DLC to be enjoyable. I have no problem with additional content coming out after the base game's release, but it shouldn't take away the enjoyment from the base game. At some point just make a new game and quit selling us content piece by piece. Ck2 is an incredible game, but suffers from the DLC making the base game unappealing by itself. I didn't want to buy this game for the longest time because of the now classic DLC approach. I can understand that, after 4+ Years, having at most 6 expansions costing $5 to $10 could be reasonable especially if the base game was more fleshed out to start. However, the existing cluster pile of DLC acts as a major turn off for players. It creates the feeling of having to pay for the basic structure of the game and to flesh it out. At this point, we're not judging whether Paradox will make a good game, but how much it will cost us to enjoy every bit of it. I honestly enjoy Paradox games and I hope to enjoy more in the future. Just as usual if you purchase any of their games remember to be patient, wait for sales and slowly navigate the DLC barrier without letting it kill your wallet.UPDATE 4/10/16:With the release of Mare Nostrum, It's evident that Pardox Interactive is trying to milk their games in increasing fashion. This is pitiful and doesn't show well for the future of Hearts of Irons 4, Stellaris and their other franchises. These are good quality games being subjected to obnoxious pay walls. Paradox makes base games that are just good enough to entice people to buy multitudes of DLC fillers which in the end ruins consumer enjoyment. Paradox knows what it's doing and all of their community streams and involvements are distractions to make us buy into a friendly exterior and therein be consoled into buying their products. The only action I'd want them to take is in their DLC practices. If you're going to sell us the game piece by piece then at least make it more worthwhile. Combine the cosmetic and music packs into their corresponding  main DLC expanisions then lower the prices to $9.99 and lower. You may think you'll lose far too much profit this way or that your efforts are underrepresented at such prices, but you'll have both a greater purchasing base and a longer lasting franchise to milk if you do this. If the reason prices are so high is because not enough people are buying the product then this solution would solve that problem in the long term. If you have merely caluclated that you can sell at these unreasonable prices and still make a hefty profit then whoever made that decision should be fired. Our else, your company will be crushed under the boot of companies like Sega, who specifically has turned CA and Relic Entertainment into DLC producing Cash Cows that take all the heat.Your CEO has stated you're undergoing the IPO process, therefore you'll be an option for buyout within a year or two. The gaming industry is full of puppeted developers straddled by larger publishing corporations that use them as proxy moneymakers without taking any real accountablity. You're on a path that will be your undoing; please become something better, Paradox, not something so pitiful and so often seen with developers.			"

What is Crusader Kings 2?Explaining what Crusader Kings 2 is is difficult. There are 9 ""Major"" DLC""s for this game, which add as much content as the base game, and drastically opens the game. So what Crusader Kings 2 is, greatly depends on which DLC""s you get. What this game is though at its core, is a real time strategy game set in the medieval era's, the base game is from 1066 to 1453. The DLC's The Old Gods and Charlemagne allow for a start date of 867 and 769, respectively, allowing for over 700 years of game-play through the early dark ages, all the way to the beginning of the Rennaissance period. You can start playing as a Duke of a few provinces, under a King. A King, or an Emperor. Through this time, you will be restricted by realistic ""rules and laws"" which governed the world at that time as you balance your lands among your vassals, and family. Keeping the Feudal system together, your people happy, and making sure vassals don't revolt, is much tougher than you'd think. You could start off as a King with 40 Vassals, 70 counties, and countless castles in your control, and in 200 years, find yourself owning nothing more than a half disseveled castle in a province nobody cares about, having lost your seat on the throne, to an usurping vassal who got the better of you. Or you could find yourself in the same situation in reverse, having bested your King on the field of battle, and taking the throne for your own. Holy Wars, cultural differences. Supporting, and or working against your King, or Emperor, vassalizing near by independent rulers, and sometimes, even attempting assassinations against your own family, are all things which you may need to do, to keep your next of heir securely in line for the throne, and your current holdings and estates safely in the family. The game revolves, not around the country, but your family. In Medieval ages, your family ""house"" is whats important. As your current ruler dies, you will take direct control of the next of heir of your house, and they will gain the titles which the laws of your country allow depending on succession laws. The politics are setup pretty realistically to how it was in those days as well. Marrying off a daughter is what made alliances, nothing else. (Not 100% accurate, but damn close enough to be considered ""historical""). Succession laws of how your children are allowed to take the throne, greatly impacts your future as well. All in all if you love Medieval history, and want to learn more about how it worked, this game will teach you things you never knew. If you own Europa Universalis IV, there is a converter which you can get for Crusader Kings 2, Allowing you to convert the world exactly as it is from Crusader Kings 2, into Europa Universalis IV, allowing you to continue your reign of your Kingdom, as you move from the Medieval ages, into the age of Rennaissance and exploration.  There is no game that has better replayability than Crusader Kings 2. I have played nearly 400 different games, and have over 1000 hours in this game. (Before I got it on steam), and not a single one of my games has been remotely close to playing out like any other. -------------------The DLC'sI know there are some upheavels about the amount of DLC's, and some people screaming bloody murder and cash grab insults. I have to beg to differ, and I'd like to explain why if you're one of those people who have been hearing this. This game was released in Feb, 14th of 2012. That's 4 years as of this year in 2016. In those 4 years, Paradox has released 9 ""Major"" DLC's, which open the game up tremendously, and add in depth mechanics, new events, and great game changes, all of which are superb. (You can tell if it's a ""Major"" DLC if the price is over 1.99) These DLC's are not ""DLC's"", they are the equievalant of legit expansions from back in the day, when a developer would release an expansion to a game you had to pay for, which adds just as much as the base game originally had. The Old Gods for instance, allows you to play as the Pagans. All with their own 100's of new events for both pagan and non pagan leaders, new mechanics for the pagans, and opens the game up tremendously in that area, as well as pushing the start date back another 200 years. The Republic expansoin does, well what you think. Allows you to play as a Merchant Republic, such as Venice, AND allows any leader to setup a Merchant Republic within their own country, which greatly increases gold income. Playing as a Merchant Republic is vastly different than playing as a feudal lord, and is yet again another major expansion, adding 100's of new events, entirely new different type of game-play to play around if you're playing as a Merchant Republic, etc. The list goes on for every single one of those 9 ""Major"" DLC's. None of which are a rip off in anyway for the price because of how much each add to the game as a whole.  So what about those countless 1.99 stuff? This is where I can understand if people say ""cash grab"", however I personally would still disagree to some extent simply because being an Indie developer myself, I understand the work that does need to be put in to make it viable. Albeit it still isn't much work over all. The 1.99 little DLC's which change sprites on the map, or allow for more family house crest art to personally change, etc. its over all cheap, and it's entirely up to you to buy it or not. They however in no way take away from the game by not having them, and are all cosmetic. The ones I personal like are the ones which change the look of the people and their outfits, etc. to fit the time and appearance they'd of had for that culture and area in the world a bit more than the stock game. These are all very cheap however, 1.99 to about 3.99, depending on how much it adds, but all of which are about 10x cheaper than going to the movies, which only nets you 1 hour of annoyance while you try to enjoy it, and people decide now is a good time to be loud and annoying.. I'd rather pay the 7 small DLC's for the same price and fully enjoy it for the rest of my life... Step aside movies..			"

												Do you enjoy unintentionally (or intentionally...?) marrying your younger siblings to your elderly parents, or conspiring to murder every member of your family, in order to work your way onto the throne? No? Well good, as that probably means you're perfectly sane.However, if you enjoy hilarious occurrences such as this in video games, (especially when they're entirely unplanned!) as well as plenty of random events to help mix things up, I have no doubt that you'll enjoy Crusader Kings II; as CK2 is essentially a peek into the lives of medieval murderers, sex-fiends, club-footed harelip Dukes, as well as many more different combinations of humorously incapable royals inbreeding their way to glory!UPDATE: After a whole string of expansions came out since originally writing this review in Feb 2012, I've decided to re-write it and have added in the list below, containing some of the more essential expansions, as not all are necessarily required:LEGACY OF ROME - This pack adds retinues and factions. As I recall it originally got a bad rap as it didn't unlock additional regions of the map to the player (like Sword of Islam, for example), but these days it really is a staple expansion, and adds a lot to the game.THE OLD GODS - Vikings! And an early start date. Honestly, I feel that the Norse add enough that this is worth putting on the 'essentials' list, as it does shake things up a bit, from the standard 'European feudal lord' formula. Might want to get this after playing a game or two of CK2 though, as a regular feudal lord, perhaps.WAY OF LIFE - I might get flak from some people by putting this into the 'essential' list, but it adds a lot more to do, during peace time. Plus Paradox has fixed the Europe-wide orgy caused by the 'seduction' focus being super-powerful, so it's not as crazy as it was right after its initial release. (For better or for worse! :P )And now for a ""good to have, but maybe don't get it until you've played the game a few times"" list. (Rolls right off the tongue, eh?)SONS OF ABRAHAM - Adds more options, events, etc. for the three Abrahamic faiths (Christianity, Judaism and Islam). Solid expansion, but not strictly required. Good for a second playthrough, or if it's on-sale when you first buy/play the game.CONCLAVE - Kind of goes hand-in-hand with WoL above, I feel. Adds more to do (particularly during peacetime) as you're not the sole power within your realm, as your council will try and gradually curb your power and become a force to be reckoned with - so don't underestimate your councilors! Definitely adds a fair bit more difficulty though, as this expansion can result in a lot more civil wars occurring, if you aren't adept at ingame diplomacy and gaining favours, etc. so you may want to save this for your second playthrough.SWORD OF ISLAM - Makes Muslim rulers playable, and adds in decadence mechanics for them. Good for a second or third playthrough, after you have your fill of playing as a Christian.THE REPUBLIC - Same as SoI above, except it makes Republics playable. Adds in trading post mechanics (among others) for more money-making opportunities.REAPER'S DUE - This pack expands upon the existing disease mechanics, and makes the Black Death a very real threat! It also allows you to hire a court physician, who will then proceed to cut your leg off and/or gouge your eye out, in order to cure your cold. Fun expansion, but not essential.CHARLEMAGNE - This adds in a start date even earlier than TOG's start. Good if you want extremely long games that wind up taking a heavily alt-history route, but be aware that Europe will most likely be occupied by 4-5 huge blobs by 1066, so it might become a bit of a slog, late-game.RAJAS OF INDIA - OK if you want to play in India, but be warned that unless you get a huge, sprawling empire going, there won't actually be much (if at all) interaction between India and the rest of the game world. Really, I think they could've just made this into a separate game mode/campaign option.			"

												Since this is the game I played the most on Steam, I figured it was about time I reviewed it. Now, I don't approve Paradox DLC policy but I played my entire first game of about 90 hours as the empire of Britannia (All Hail Brittannia) without any DLC and the game was still very fun to play. So if the price of all the DLC scares you, give it a try without any DLC and, even once you decide to buy DLC, just get the one that you actually want. For example, I never even use the game music, I always just mute it and play my own playlist so I obviously won't ever get any of the songs DLC. That being said, even if the DLC do not scare you, this game is for hardcore strategy games fans. The first 5 hours of the game will be mostly you figuring everything out and theres really not much tutorials to help you out.If you can get past all that though, this is the most fun and deep strategy game I have ever played. There is almost nothing you can't do in this game. Wanna make your loyal little brother an anti-pope since the pope excommuniated you because the french king (who happens to be his best friend) really hate you? And then later go to war with that pope and make your little brother the official pope for every catholics. You can. I know you can do that cause I did. Wanna make your last born son your heir even though he has 6 older brothers because he has by far the best stats since he was born a genius. And then have to imprison all your other sons when they inevitably plot to murder him? You can. I know you can do that cause I did. Want to make Buddhist the official religion of everyone in Europe through war and oppression? You can. I know you can do that cause I did. History is yours to write however you want. Thats why I love this game.The game is also full of random events that always keep the game interesting. Hell, after almost 400 hours, I'm still running into random events that I hadn't seen before (it helps that Paradox sometimes add new ones.) So yeah, despite its flaws, this is my favorite game on Steam and I have no doubt that I will probably play another 400 hours of it eventually.Oh and by the way, when you start a new game, turn off shattered retreat and defensive pacts cause those really sucks and break the immersion. That patch was the worst idea Paradox ever had.			"

												Let's set things straight: this is one of the best Paradox game and probably my favourite one since it covers a period of time I like a lot and since it's less complex and tactical than other Paradox. It has got, instead, a great RPG component. An amazing mix which makes the game very addicting.Why the negative review? Because this game alone is almost nothing. It lets you play just a very small amount of countries. If you want the full game you must buy the DLCs... nothing new you could think. Well, the problem is there is a HUGE amount of DLCs and after years from the publishing of the main game they're still developing new one. They're getting always more useless, DLC after DLC, while the price gets higher (some of the last costs half the main game...LOL).As a loyal and old Paradox fan i get frustrated not only because they're obviously trying to get any cents out of my wallet, but mainly because after 4 (FOUR!) years I still can't enjoy the full game: whenever you start a new campaign (and a CK game can be pretty long and time consuming) they announce a new DLC with new features and new rules and you feel like you're playing an useless match and feel like abandoning it and wait for the new DLC. Problem is: when you get it, they have already announced a new one.Also, every DLC comes with patches which totally change the rules of the game and you have to learn them again and again and again. It's like playing an early access game, but I've always hated those and I would have avoided it if I had known.Basically they're policy with games lately has become: ""let's publish an incomplete game and let's charge a lot with DLCs if they want to play its full version"" and they're not the only company to do it, but when they finished the game they started to make useless DLCs (there's one of fantasy history in which aztecs invade Europe... which is not a great thing in a game of such historic realism) and to change the rules to worse just to justify new DLCs. They're literally to the point in which a great game is turning into a bad one.Saddest thing for a loyal customer like me was the DLC to convert CK2 games into EU4 games to continue a campaign there. So I, a huge fan who bought all of your games, get rewarded for this by being forced to pay 10 euro just for a crappy converter if I want to ""fuse"" together the Paradox games I possess? Nice policy Paradox...To give you an idea, today you need 165€ just to play the full game (without even considering the massive amount of graphic and soundtrack DLCs or the EU4 converter) and DLCs are still coming out. The game can be good but its not worth half of that price.You better wait till they start working on CK3 and stop squeezing money out of this game. Then maybe they'll lower the price of a 4 years old game (prices are still the same even for the main game) and you can buy a cheap package with all the DLCs.It's not worth a penny before that. You can trust someone who loved this and other Paradox games.			"

												Edit: I'm about to pass over six hundred hours of playtime on this game and it's all pretty much legitimate. No other game has held my attention for as long as Crusader Kings 2 has. Years have passed and I still come back to this game simply because there is still so much more to do and Paradox Interactive has done a tremendous job in supporting the game with content post-release. Simply put, Crusader Kings 2 is my favorite game of all time, hands down.I've spent over three hundred hours on this game and I don't regret a single minute. Well, not exactly. I regret a lot of things done during my playthrough of this game but it happens after playing a dynasty for four hundred years! This is a fantastic game and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in spending hours upon hours trying to decide whether to assassinate that dimwitted son of yours currently in line for your throne!

												Crusader Kings II is, IMHO, Paradox's best game.  It's a grand strategy game that throws many of the popular complexities of the genre such as a complicated tech tree, deep strategic combat, and a rich economy and city building out the window for very simple implementations of each and replaces it all with one thing: interpersonal drama.  It's all about what other people have that you want and what you have that other people want, and it produces epic struggles, dramatic twists of fate, and wonderful soap opera fodder.  At the start of the game if you have a small nation, you can play it a bit like a standard 4X.  Locate a smaller neighbor with no major allies, conquer, repeat.  As your empire grows, however, you begin to need to split up your holdings among relatives and friends- a province here, a duchy there.  And then those people begin to want things, and have armies, and begin to plan among themselves.  And maybe you have too many children, and those who aren't getting enough of the land start to hate you.  And maybe your king dies and his underaged heir who fewer people like and nobody respects takes over under the care of one of your trusted vassels, who may even now be plotting regicide.  When that daughter you married off a decade ago and forgot about suddenly inheriets a third of the Holy Roman Empire due to an accident of inheritance laws and a suspiciously high mortality rate among the nobility?  The knives will begin to come out before the crown has had time to settle on her brow, and damage control doesn't even begin to cover what follows.  Play enough of this game, and familicide won't even be an interesting enough story to warrant telling your spouse about after another play session where you stayed up three hours later than you wanted it.  Crusader Kings II is big, and imposing, and takes a long time to play, but there's pretty much nothing like it out there.  It might take a dozen hours before you really get what's going on, and I suspect most people who even try it will bounce off of it without understanding why it's such a big deal.  If it bites into you, though, your time will be repaid with an endless array of amazing stories and crazy alternate histories of Europe.			"

												This is probably one of my favorite games of all time, but Paradox has gone mad with DLCs, content packs, and basically just any way to get money out of the consumer that doesn't require improving the actual game itself.It's like painting over a wall with a giant gaping hole in it.Oh, and you're paying for the paint.

												While enjoying the Multiplayer feature a good friend of mine became 'The Cuckold'.His Beautiful Norwegian wife decided to take several other lovers and created illegitamate children out of these escapades which we found very amusing and refused for many months to help him get his household under control. After receiving exhorborant bribes from him we set our Spymasters to work exacting judgement on this trifling woman and her lovers. Restoring his honor and his lineage took quite a bit of resources but we managed to sort out the whole 'affair'. He was actually quite upset that she had almost destroyed him.Next game we will all secretly choose seduction focus and lure his wives, sisters and daughters into out bedchambers to ♥♥♥♥ him right off again.10/10 for friendship.

												Let me tell you a little story.I was a mere count in Italy, an unimportant man, living my little life, raising my son, loving my wife. But I was pretty popular among other counts and dukes and so it happened that I was elected a king of Italy. Being young and ambitious I started to build my kingdom and earn the fame and glory I knew I was destined for. My reign was glorious, no revolts, no problems, only growth and prosperity and so holding a great tournament seemed like a great idea. But I was a diplomat, not a warrior and so it happened that I got maimed. Two years later I died of a combination of my wound and common flu. My 15 years old son became the king, but the vassals didn´t like him and soon enough they asked him to hand over the crown. He wasn´t gonna give it up so easily and so the war over the kingdom of Italy began. However my son underestimated the strength of his opposition and was forced to surrender. The new king imprisoned him and refused to ransom him, because he still had a claim on the kingdom. Three years later my son died and because he had no heirs, the game was over.This little story, my friends, is the reason why I f*cking love this game.			"

												Iam sorry Paradox, but i have to write this now. I realy like Crusader Kings II, as i played nearly 300 Hours and many more on a non-steam Version. You can have fun with these games, spend hour after hour with it. I will not say the game is bad or not worth a bit of money...but there is a big argument against this game, or i would say against the DLC-Policy of Paradox. It is just insane how this is managed. Just take a look at the numbers...Steam tells me all DLC cost more than 270€ now. Okay lets say half of that is stuff you dont need, content packs etc...still 135€ plus the game for 40€. Iam no new player and played from the first years on and bought everything when it came out. But do you even know how stupid it is if you have friends just starting the game and telling them which DLC they need and stuff? They release a new DLC every few months with a few new things. Often they are good and iam very exited. But the are not everytime worth all the money. And they must be making alot of money thinking about the price. And i know...they say we put out new DLC to get some money to further develop the game and the game will get new content as long as the people buy the DLCs. Okay, that may sound good at first. But how do other game studios manage their stuff? Do they need to get out new DLC every few months for 15-25€(DLC+Contentpack)? NO. And that is almost the price of the whole game. And a DLC might bring some new stuff but not half of the game. So it is just too expensive.But it does not stop there. Iam a real Paradox-Freak you could say. I play almost all their big titles, Victoria, Europa Universalis, Stellaris, City Skylines, Hearts of Iron...you name it, i played hundreds of hours. And almost everywhere it is the same b*llsh*t!!! I want to play some Crusader Kings? Have to buy 2-3 DLCs to be on the newest Version. Stellaris the same. HoI4 the same. Skylines the same. What is that? I was so hyped about Stellaris. And the game was only half done, felt hollow and now they probably want to go the EU4 way and fix it over the years with tons of DLC. I just cant stand it anymore. After these many years iam frustrated and angry. I dont want to support this any longer. And what i hate the most about it, that maybe in a few months, i have some money, theres a sale and i will buys this freakin DLC anyway. BUT I HATE THEIR POLICY! AND I STILL WANT TO PLAY THAT STUFF! THEY GOT ME AND THEY USE ME! Combining all their game i probably payed them over 1000€ already. *Put a bad word here*!But they could do it differently. Why not bring out REAL DLC or a decent Add-On. Or Victoria 3. Where the hell is Victoria 3? Victoria was the best game they made in my opinion. But whatever. Someday Paradox will see that their way is the wrong way. Many people i know think the same. They are ruining these great games.tl;dr:If you are looking for an advice...the game is fun and you will probably like it. But Paradox has a real ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC-Policy. After a few years you will hate them, just like me. (I wrote almost the same Review for other Paradox Games. Everywhere the same Thing)			"

												I bought this game about 2 years ago for Christmas while it was about 35% off along with Fallout 3 and Dishonored. The trailer for CK2 made me intensely excited for it so I could live out all of my medieval fantasies to my heart's content. Upon opening the game however, I found myself seriously outmatched by the game's steep learning curve. That, coupled with the fact that I had bought two other masterpieces, made it difficult for me to rationalize spending the hours it would take for me to truly get into the game. About 2 months later after beating Fallout 3 and Dishonored, I dedicated myself to learning CK2 and to this day, I regret not doing it earlier. For anyone who wonders why it is so difficult to learn this game, the answer is very simple. It was very difficult to be a successful ruler in the medieval era. How should you know what you can and cannot do without experience? With this in mind, I encourage everyone to buy this game and sink about 20 hours into the game before making their judgements. I am certain that you will think differently about your purchase by that point and truly feel that it was worth it.			"

												""Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."" - Lord ActonThe Medieval Age wasn't the brightest moment in human history. War, Assassination, Torture, Greed, Betrayal; those are merely some of the words associated with the atrocities committed by the rulers of the realm. Some good and honest men have ruled, but most rulers couldn't resist the temptation from the power they wield; the power to rule. They were tempted to gain more power, and they are willing to use even the most atrocious of acts to gain it.Crusader Kings II gives players a taste of that power.Starting at any point from 1066 (Or 769 with a certain DLC enabled) to 1453, players are allowed to choose from a very large amount of historical characters that once ruled over a part of Europe and parts of Asia and Africa. From the lowliest duke to the highest emperor, the game has no final objective whatsoever, leaving players to create their own story and decide their own goals for their dynasty. Do you want to be the most prestigious family in the world? To work your way up and create an empire that will last for generations? Or simply to make sure your bloodline survives through all the coming conflict? Grand strategy games typically put players as an eternal invisible guiding force controlling a single country, viewing the world from above as a map as they manage the country’s Politics, Economy, Military, and Diplomacy through various factors. These games use simple visuals to accommodate the large scale gameplay. There are no fancy Total War-like massive battles or anything of sort. Almost every aspect of the game depends on numbers. In other words, the main part gameplay is to manage those numbers and the various factors affecting it to the player’s benefit.Crusader Kings II offers a sandbox grand strategy experience into a more personal level; giving players control over a single Catholic ruler (later DLCs adds the options to play as Muslim, Pagan, and Jewish rulers) and continue on as his/her heir after passing away. Instead of dealing with faceless countries, the more personal approach allows the game to have a large amount of characters, be it a lord or a simple courtier. Every character in the game has their own set of skills, traits, and relations with other characters. A major part of the game is managing the relationship between characters by various interactions. You can cement the loyalty of your vassals by keeping them happy with gifts and inviting them to feasts. You can increase the odds of success of an assassination plot by inviting treacherous people within your target's court. You can declare a war for a title your courtier has a claim on. Be wary as other characters could do it to you as well. The best option is to trust no one, not even your friends and relatives. These interactions increase the depth of Crusader King II's strategic gameplay in a very dynamic way.The trademark Paradox's grand strategy gameplay is still present, even if somewhat simplified by the time period. Politics are mostly done by the character interactions mentioned above; with the addition of a player-manageable council the players can use accomplish certain tasks. Economy is much more simplified, with very little emphasis on trade. Instead of training units to form standing armies, you form a temporary military force in time of war, then disband them when the war is over. Your military comes from raising levies both from your personally owned holdings and from your vassals. (Retinues were added with a DLC). Religion plays a major role in the game, with each religion having some unique gameplay mechanic that differ them from the rest; such as the Papacy for Catholics and Decadence for Muslims. While the strategy gameplay itself for most the most part lacks depth compared to other Paradox grand strategy titles, Crusader Kings II still stands on its own as a well-made and unique game.Crusader Kings II is visuals are simple, yet fitting for the game. The map is fully rendered in 3D, it’s nothing breathtaking, but you can still appreciate the beauty of its landscape; although you'll probably spend most of the time using the political map mode. The character portraits are a great mix of realism and cartoony art style which provides a variety of colorful characters faces.The musical score for the game is also worth praising. While not all the music in the game is memorable, they rarely distract you from the game, and for the most part they complement your playthrough with a variety of beautiful music fitting for the era.The game is without its flaws, of course. While the tutorial is an improvement from previous Paradox titles, you will still need to learn most of the game’s mechanics on your own by trial or error. While it could be a part of the fun of playing the game, some people may dislike it. I’ve encountered several minor bugs, but the game is fully playable as of now. Another minor complaint is the lack of naval combat. While historically there wasn’t a lot of naval combat at the era, I wish that navies could be more useful such as for blockading ports. But as for the time this review was written, the only use for navies is for troop transport.Describing everything about Crusader Kings II’s in detail would take a lot of time and energy. Both of which you could be using right now to purchase and experience Crusader Kings II on your own! (Or at least try the demo) Go and create your own story with your dynasty. Be patient and play as an honest, good natured ruler. Or fall to the temptation of power and spill the blood of anyone who stands in your way. The choice is yours.Deus Vult.			"

												My favorite game of all time. 800+ Hours. They ruined it with this patch. They ruined it with Conclave. I fell into the machine, I bought almost all the DLC (unit packs and songs and content packs excluded) yet they finally broke me. To those of you who know the problems then this was a shattered retreat, a destruction to everything good. This is the greatest game of all time before 2.5. Now it is mediocre at best. They keep trying to fix the game but don't realize they are trying to fix things that were never broken. Wars, factions, CHILD EDUCATION. All broken. They add in terrible things that were never there like coalitions. I wish they stopped adding content after horselords. Unlike most I have an almost inexhaustable wallet for things I like such as this game. Most can't handle these DLC purchases which allow you to use things that should've been in it in the first place. Muslims, Pagans, Nomads, the Byzantine Empire, Republics, Indians. That's a solid chunk of the map unplayable to you unless you continue on with purchases. This was a game where you could play 800 hours easy, but now I'm sick of Paradox ""improving"" the game, and my eyes are open to the money grabbing and micro-transactions which have all but made people hate Total War: Attila. Too many good games have fallen to micro-transactions, it's rude and insulting to us the consumer. Those of you who lay down, eat Paradox's excrement and praise the taste are only encouraging this gross mismanagement of success. I hope this game is fixed, but I will not play it until my grievances are at least somewhat addressed.			"

												At the time of writing, this $40 game has $240 of DLC available.Crusader Kings II is a great game - and I'm not using that word lightly, it's a GREAT game - but I can't recommend it.  I've put a lot of hours into this game (more than Steam has counted), but it's never been a fulfilling experience because of all the goddamed DLC.Listen, I'm no enemy to DLC, if a developer makes more content for their game, I'll pay to play it.  But the way Paradox does it is straight up insidious.""This new update adds North Africa to the game......but you can't play there unless you buy the Sword of Islam DLC""""The newest update adds all of India to the vanilla map.......but you can't play there unless you buy the Rajas of India DLC""""We just added the entire Asian continent to the game.......but you can't play there unless you buy the Horse Lords DLC""DLC in this game isn't comparable to DLC in other games, it's not like it adds a weapon skin or an extra level.  Crusader Kings II DLC fundamentally changes the core gameplay of the game, and some things that have DRASTIC changes on how you play (such as the ability to have a standing army, form custom kingdoms, or even the existence of the Jewish religion) are hidden behind 4 years and $240 of DLC.To put it simply, I have never felt like I was playing a finished game.  Every time I turn it on, there's an ad for yet another piece of DLC.  Once I finally save up enough to buy the next biggest DLC pack, another is announced.  It's just not fulfilling.Until Paradox decides to wrap this game up like they've done with Europa Universalis IV and Hearts of Iron III, and put their energy to developing Crusader Kings III instead of squeezing more DLC money out of current players, I can't recommend it.

												Crusader Kings II on first look seems like just another game styled after so many other well-known games that use an overhead map and a time period. That’s where things steer into a different direction. This game may well be the best game created by the game smiths at Paradox Development Studio. It’s a huge strategy game with layers. I would suggest running the tutorial in the game. In fact I would also suggest keeping the hints option on, it is full of valuable playing information.Taking place over a 400 year time span the players take on the persona of a character running the realms and struggling to make it in these troublesome times.Throughout the game life, the character deals with the world and other characters of the court, they have stats and traits; they marry, and have children in hopes of conceiving an heir to the throne. That is the main point too, having a legitimate heir to the kingdom. As that first main character grows older and or dies before their time, as long as there is an heir the game goes on to 1452. Hierarchy and the bloodline are of some importance in this game as it was in yee olden days.The game plays in different ways depending on how the player chooses to start. Hierarchy plays a role here. So if the player starts out as a lower rank of the upper class, say a Count, well you have some leveling to do. There is so much information to be had during game play it can be over whelming at times; thankfully Paradox Development Studio has integrated so many buttons and drop downs to assist the player in keeping track of events and information. Plus the game can be paused to take a break or assess the situation. The interface and game play seems polished enough, though the animations took some getting used to.As gaming goes in the grand strategy style, there is some replay ability here, with so much going on, try different playing styles, be aggressive, or less so. See how things turn out, be a tyrant if you like.The graphics of the lands and seas are beautiful to behold, with clouds shadow and weather passing over the lands as you look down from your almost celestial view from above. Sound is pleasing as well, with music and sound bites setting the mood for events appropriately. This is truly one of the better games to come out from Paradox Development Studio, now like most strategy games, things do not progress always at a fast pace. So some patience in gaming is involved here. Crusader Kings II is exactly the sort of game I was hoping it would be. As deep and complex as its predecessor, but more accessible.			"

												Ultimately, after 200 hours on a game (I'm not really a gamer so 200 hours is _insane_ for me to spend on a game) like this, you'd think I could recommend Crusader Kings II. Sadly, I am just not able to anymore. My view of CKII is pretty mixed, so I'll try to give the good with the bad. I'll start with the good first, since I plan to expand more on the bad.THE GOOD-The map is gorgeous and easily the best looking of all of Paradox's games. -Music, even without the music pack DLCs, is pretty great and I've never really gotten tired of it.-The history is, at least on the surface, simulated pretty well and I enjoy having some of the weirder and obscure characters in history able to be played like the last Karling, a random Christian ruler in Seljuk Anatolia, and so on. It's nice that they'll include stuff like that even if you can only access it by skipping to a very specific year.-The early DLCs, particularly The Old Gods, are genuinely fun. I love playing as the Norse during the Age of the Vikings and it's honestly one of the best parts of the game. It's to the point I almost wish The Old Gods was spun off as a different game (similar to For the Glory) to focus on just that era and expand more into Viking clans, religion, etc.-Unlike most I've played Crusader Kings 1 extensively and while there are a lot of steps back from that game, I do like that the council does more than just improve ruler stats. Letting your council micro-manage your realm (before they ruined it with Conclave) is genuinely very fun and makes it feel more like an actual feudal state.-It got me, someone who doesn't really like video games enough to be called a ""gamer"" (most of the games on my Steam are gifts are stuff I bought and never played), to play for 200 hours so that's got to count for something.THE BAD-First off, the DLCs. Holy ♥♥♥♥, the DLCs. Paradox, when I am expected to pay $15 to play as a Jew, when there are literally fewer than 10 Jewish players to even play in nearly _700 years_ of gameplay, how do you even justify that? Really, the DLCs have turned a good $60 game into a bloated mess that Paradox wants you to pay nearly $200 for. Even as someone with the means to do so, this game does _not_ deserve that price and is simply not good enough for it. I've bought strategy games for the PC that start at $100 retail because they are done with mind-boggingly amounts of research, study, and care. Crusader Kings II is not that good.-Besides the price of the DLCs, which is crazy, the amount of content that you have to add on to the game is out of control. Not only does it mean the base game is almost worthless, but that you start to break your game the more you add on to it. It is simply ridiculous and is something that warns off new players when they see mountains of DLC.-Patches that you have no control over that break your game. I am one of the poor people who bought Conclave on Day 1 and even though I have since turned it off like any sensible person, the forced patch means that I can't escape some of the worse parts of the DLC whether I want it or not. Paradox breaks your game for you and there is no real way to go back. I miss the days of the old Paradox games when I refused to upgrade EU 3 for over a year until better patches came around.-Conclave. Just...♥♥♥♥ing Conclave. If you want to know why it's so bad read one of the other reviews but suffice to say it breaks any sense of believability or historical playability of the game and turns it into a game that is almost impossible to play if you are anything more than a duke, and a minor duke at that. -Speaking of which...Paradox, either accept that your games are, you know, games or try to be more historical. You can't be either. Iqta government is not feudalism, CK II can't even begin to simulate medieval economies, and India. Didn't. Work. That. Way. I am a history nerd myself and that's why I enjoy Paradox games, but the way the game has been lately with the recent expansions it is almost impossible to try to play a game historically with the way that CKII works. Economy is a joke, armies don't work how they should, vassals aren't simulated anywhere near realistically, rebellions happen more often than they should for some countries and never for others (I have yet to see the Golden Horde have any problem ruling all of Russia past 1300 and often survives all the way to the end of the game fully intact).-A lot of the bad things in the game feel like a step back from Crusader Kings 1, which is one of my best games ever to this day. Events are basically nerfed and pointless now which severely hampers roleplaying, different numbers for a vassal's opinion of you and loyalty are gone which makes holding empires together almost impossible, armies and economy are massively changed and almost never for the better, and in general CK II just feels...less in depth. In Crusader Kings I, despite a smaller scope, I could really get lost into the intricacies of day-to-day rule. By this point in CK II with all the patches I rarely if ever care who my king is and never interact with him. I can't remember the last time it mattered who I marry beyond alliances, even.Overall, CK II is a slick-looking game with a ton of problems underneath. I keep playing it because it is, on a level, addicting, but it's far too broken and mismanaged for me to totally enjoy it or recommend it. Sadly, since the release of Conclave my playtime has taken a nosedive and it's unlikely I'll keep playing. EU4 is at least fun enough without Mare Nostrum to keep playing but with the forced patches and general unlikeability of the gameplay, I can't say I'd tell anyone I know to play CK II. Oh well, at least we'll always have CK 1.			"

												This game will teach you all you need to know about subjective morality, medieval history, and incest. If you think you're a good person, I dare you to try this game. You too will be murdering unneeded and unlanded family members and cheating on your spouse while blackmailing the priests who serve under you for better tithes within no time. Ever watched the show Game of Thrones and thought that that Jeoffrey guy was on to something? Maybe you're a fan of Henry VIII, a King of England who lived and breathed debauchery and intrigue (whatever you judge it as morally, that must have been a compelling life, no?) and made war whenver he felt he could? You can more or less act out any medieval power fantasy you'd like here, with options becoming more and more complex as you learn to manipulate diplomacy and how to plan more intricately.I cannot recommend this enough if you're into grand strategy like me.

												It's easy to start up CK II and not get what the fuss is about. Another Euro-centric medieval simulator, like we haven't seen that before. With a snail pace and no sprawling, Total War like combat, it seems more like a ""watch time pass"" simulator than a game.But you start a game nonetheless. You chose to start as a small, independent region - maybe the one where you or your ancestors hail from - glory to the motherland and all that. And you just want to learn the ropes, no need to get into anything large. The game starts; you press play and fiddle with the speed. Nothing happens. You leave it on high. Minutes pass; nothing happens. 'OK', let's see what this button at the top left does. You spend the next half hour fiddling with all the info there, trying to make sense of it. From time to time, pop-ups show up, detailing little events that seem to have no impact on the game. 'Oh, cool. This random courtesan fancies me. Who friggin' cares?'.But one message catches your eye - the neighboring ♥♥♥-hat has decided he likes your lands and he'd like to make them his lands. You quickly raise your impressive army only to watch in horror as ten times as many butcher them with ease. Your dynasty ends with its founders head on a pile. Game over.OK, that went as well as can be expected - can't be be blamed for not winning with the small guy on the first time. You start up another game, this time as the biggest, baddest nation that you see - what greater joy could there be than to steamroll all your punier neighbors into fine grains of dust? As the game starts, you watch with greedy eyes as the gold rolls into your treasury. 'Yeah, time to build some ♥♥♥♥'. 'What? It takes one year, costs that much and increases my army by ♥♥♥♥-all percent in this region only?? Screw that, time to slaughter some franks'. 'OK, diplomacy, declare war... Why is it greyed out? Casus Beli??? WTF is that?'. But no matter, while you were scouring your memory of high-school Latin, the guys to the south have graciously decided to bring the fight to you. 'Pathetic basters, they're like half my size. This is going to be fun'. You raise your levies and merge them into one big glob. 'That skull must mean I'm one deadly S.O.B' you think to yourself. And you march to meet them head on, only to see your guys start to die off before you even get there. 'Doesn't matter' you think to yourself, 'I still outnumber them 2:1'. By the time your armies meet, it's more like 1.5 to 1, and you still barely beat them. But you do. Time to reap the rewards...Your peasants have taken up arms against you.Your vassals have risen up to lower crown authority.Your king has died, only to be inherited by a possessed dimwit.You have been excommunicated.The franks have decided that that small little province on the border is theirs and they are willing to drown you in blood for it.Game over.At this moment you are fuming. You steel yourself - this stupid game isn't going to get the better of you. You start thinking, 'what's the best starting point?'. You start again, this time as a count in province deep in the heart of a stable empire. You start slow, making friends with everyone. Then your lord and brother dies, making you the new Duke. 'Oh, so I don't have to attack everyone to take their land'. You make a mental note. The years pass; through claim fabrication, key marriages and poisoned wines you grab a few more adjacent duchies. A few gold coins later and you are the King of Bavaria.This makes the emperor uneasy. He demands that you release a duchy that he claims is rightfully his. You're too weakened from your last conquest to fight him - and it's just a small province anyway. You grin your teeth and accept his demands. And the years pass again; your line is well loved and respected by your emperor and fellow vassals. You are seen as a keen supporter of his Imperial Majesty. But the strangest thing keeps happening. All the bright, attractive or strong princes, they never seem to make it pass infancy. As generations pass, the crippled, the dim and the feeble seem to favored by some unseen force and raise to the crown. Unsurprisingly, your fellow lords are not happy with this rule.The time has come. You start a movement, to replace the inheritance law with an elective one. A bloody civil war erupts and, after many years, you emerge the victor. You are now next in line to become the most powerful man in Europe. Just. one. more. assassination.And... the Huns happen. Your empire is too weak and you fail to protect your lands against the scourge.GAME OVER.It's morning. You have to go to work in about an hour. You call in sick.You probably are...			"

												An Indian family fleeing from oppression in their home province found asylum in my Kingdom of Norway. Why not, I thought. The father of the family was a decent warrior, so I allowed him to command troops in battle. He distinguished himself in many wars over the years and was awarded one of the recently conquered counties in Northern Germany. He continued to serve me loyally and has even converted to Norse religion. For his service I gave him a duchy to rule. Generation after generation his descendants continued to marry local nobles.Now, nearly two centuries later, Germany is ruled by white dudes in turbans who think they're Indian, worship Norse gods and train War Elephants. Breaking history has never been so much fun!I started playing CK2 during a free weekend. It looked like something I might like, so I gave it a try. I bought the game the next day along with several DLCs and never stopped playing. CK2 has now climbed to number 1 of my most played Steam games, in spite of being in my library for less than a year. I don't recall another ""game addiction"" that lasted this long for me. And there is the fact that nearly 400 hours into the game I've only played as one of the many game religions, one of the numerous cultures (disregarding the training scenario). Playing as a different religion, culture, starting location, starting rank changes the way you play the game. You could even start your second play through in the exact same character as last time and the way things will go will be entirely different. This game is more complex than any other strategy I've played before. It takes a while to take it all in. Luckily there are in-game hints to what every screen means and what every button does (you can switch these off later, but I found myself checking every now and then). There is also a tutorial campaign that will teach you how to play.What adds to the fun greatly is the fact that you play as a specific character. Their traits and abilities make them more appropriate for certain roles within the Kingdom than others. The current King might make a better priest than military commander, but you don't say that out loud in front of your liege (or their spymaster). Once your character dies, you play as the heir to their titles, this being usually one of their children, depending on the hereditary laws of your realm.Feel like expanding your Empire? You don't necessarily need to wage war to achieve that. Why don't you marry your eldest son to that second daughter of the neighboring empire and then make sure the first-born daughter (already married) has a little accident before she has children? However as I am not the patient type I prefer marching my armies into enemy territory and be done with it. What I love about the battles is that the smallest thing can change the outcome of the battle (much like in history). The commander of your strongest flank was killed shortly after the skirmish began and his confused troops now run around the battlefield like headless chickens? Well, s**t happens. There is always a chance, however small, that things will go wrong. It's up to you to play the odds (don't put your only heir in battle, especially while he's sick) and have a backup plan in case things don't go your way or you might end up losing your realm, or the entire game. Once I lost a major battle and most of my personal army. One of my vassals decided now was the good time to revolt, my stronger neighbor saw it as an opportunity to invade and on top of that a peasant uprising started in one of my counties. Bottom line - I lost it all and had to make tribal huts in Norway my capital, which was a bummer after living in a mighty castle in Western France for two generations.The good news is you can appoint commanders as you see fit, provided your authority within the realm is strong enough to do so. Each of the several types of troops (and culture specific special units) has a different attack and defend stats and these evolve as you research technologies and construct special buildings. Your commanders can employ various tactics during battle, some of which depend on their personal traits and/or martial capability. There are many situations you will find yourself in - often thanks to random events, most of which require very specific conditions to be met first. Many events are bound to a specific time and realms that existed at that point. I will not spoil these for you because I found it to be a lot of fun to face some of them followed by a palm on the forehead and an exclamation: “Of course, I (sort of) remember this from history lessons!”I’ve always been interested in history and considered my knowledge of geography very decent and yet I’ve learned a lot of new facts by playing CK2. My natural curiosity took over and I've since researched many medieval realms and rulers online.If you’re feeling competitive then know that achievements are only awarded if you play on Ironman mode. So please make sure that if you come across a player with some of the most difficult of achievements you salute and/or bow as appropriate.At some point you might find yourself lying on your death-bed. Your son and heir might be an imbecile, your younger brother has possibly convinced half of your court he'd make a better King than you and yet you’ll enjoy every minute of it. This game has my full recommendation.If this looks like something you might like then give it a try. But be warned - You might be buying the new number 1 in your library and may thus face the ""Should I do something meaningful with my day or should I finally become the King of England?"" decision. And we both know it can only go one way from there.			"

												I'm going to tell you a brief history of the magnificent and prestigious Pasta family; one of the most prevalent Venetian trades families that reigned Venice on and off for some 600 years. Throughout their years and with a very sordid and complicated family tree the Pasta family (stemming from their patriarch, Serene Doge Spaghetti I ""The Fat"") came to amass a previously unthought-of level of wealth. Legend has it that in the late 11th century Venetian spending ground to a complete halt as the city-state had quite literally too much money and not enough places to invest in. A ruthless and cunning family, the Pasta family spared no expense in making sure their trade ports were renowned the world over. If money was being spent in the Mediterranean, the Pasta family got a cut; to do business and avoid them was difficult. To avoid Venice altogether was impossible. While avoiding open conflict as much as they could, the Venetians did get in a few trade squabbles with the Amalfi, only to render the Greek patricians an afterthought when it came to doing business in the Mediterranean. Using a mix of intrigue and some well-placed military show-of-force, the Pasta patricians were able to get a monetary lock on almost the entire Mediterranean Sea, and were even looking to find a weak county along the Red Sea to capture so as to expand their trade empire into India. Venice made many political and cultural strides in southern Europe, notably by turning its back on Roman Catholicism in 1207 to adopt the Cathar heresy. This did very little to dissuade people from trading with them, however, as Rome itself was home to a particularly busy Pasta trade port for several hundred years at that point. It wasn't until Serene Doge Cavatappi III in 1349 did cracks begin to form in the illustrious Pasta mansion, so to speak. Through a series of marriages to various Saxon and Bavarian princes the Pasta family came in posession of a few counties in mainland Europe; far away from warm, balmy climate of Venice. Sitting on a veritable mountain of gold at this point, the Venetian powers that be tended to ignore their lands to the north, and left it in the capable hands of their respective rulers. After Penne IV, son of Cavatappi III lost the election to become the next Serene Doge (an event that did happen a few times during the 600 year Pasta tenure, but few and far in between), he decided to turn his back on Venice altogether and tore his family's ties from the Republic. Adopting a few of his rightful counties in Bavaria and suffering a hard but brief blow from the bizarre Sunset Invasion, Penne and his kin lived in a financial nightmare. While by no means broke, the family now had a mere fraction of the wealth they amassed during their mainstay in Venice. The reason not much has been written about the Pasta family is because after this exodus the dynasty pretty much lost all of its prestige and money. Left with a few counties in Saxony (which were quickly overthrown by their bigger and more powerful Frankish neighbors) and no historical records left over save for a few manuscripts found in the wine cellar of the old Pasta mansion (discovered only recently), the Pasta family became a cold, stale remnant of what it once was. The only surviving history of the family for a while was of its brief stay in mainland Europe, which was far from glorious. ...I did all of this by clicking things on a map and looking at spreadsheets. 10/10 would create a grand trade empire only to fade into obscurity and have a terrible score at the end of the game again.

												If you love strategy then you have to play this game cause it will put your skills to the test.The only bad thing is how the game can move at a snails pace, but its great excuse to do something while it plays.Like eat some pizza, do a bit of cleaning, or watch some videos.My personal favorites for this game is the long spanning games you can have with it and the organic stories to be had.One story of mine goes as followed.....I was a lowly count of Athens, clawing my way up to Doux/Duke and one day emperor.After many years of conquest of my neighbors I had four counties to my name and finally took my title as Doux.Now I served the empire as Marshal of the realm, loyally I fought wars againest the neighboring pagens and muslims.Thing took a turn for the worse when I was wrongly accused of ♥♥♥♥, I had hoped my liege would merciful, he was not....Years after my death, my son lead a revolt for elective monarchy and won, shortly after he became emperor.It was then I would get my revenge by executing the last emperor's son.With my vegance complete my family went on to restore the Roman Empire and bring order to chaos.

												It's not that I don't like this game, but the DLC is completely ridiculous. Expansions are alright, but there is no reason that they have to release other DLC with them. They have already released face packs, music packs, dynasty shield packs, and probably something else that I'm forgetting, and in their latest expansion, Charlemagne, Paradox proved that they are experts at squeezing every last dollar out of their customers. Just when I thought they had run out of face and music packs to sell, they added clothing packs. There is absolutely no reason that these cosmetic changes can't come bundled for free or at a reduced price with the expansions. In total, Crusader Kings II DLC now costs over one hundred and seventy-five dollars. While there is nothing wrong with the game by itself, the DLC model that Paradox uses is horrible, and is only defended by a group of people that have a cult-like devotion to the company.			"

 Crusader Kings II Name  - Crusader Kings IIGenre - Grand StrategyPersonal Opinion - The best strategy game there ever was! This is a pretty big game and this is my first review, so I won't delve into it too deep!  Also time played is not true, I have played this game quite a lot offline, unfortunately it does not show offline play hours. Review Crusader Kings II, a game where you can be a King, a Duke, a Count, or even an Emperor, with each level of nobility bringing a new level of difficulty, whereas if you start as a Count, you may start with only one province and depending on where you start you might end up being a vassal to someone else or even have some of your own!Given that you are a vassal, you  may   will  have to compete with other vassals, who will either be lower or higher than you, in some cases you might join a faction with other vassals to try and force the current leader of the country to do things, such as lowering taxes and gaining independence, if you gain enough support you can get things in motion by issuing an ultimatum to the Emperor/King/Duke asking for these things, and if they refuse, you will be able to start a war to get it happening.Then there's marriage, you can just about marry every single person in your kingdom, given that they aren't the same sex as you and they are 16 or over, however you can arrange a marriage for people under 16 (Betrothal).Of course it doesn't just end there, after marriage you can have little clones of yourself (Kids), and build your dynasty, then marry em' off and possibly inherit more land!Also, there are some awesome events that are random and pretty fun. Such as being a lunatic and appointing your horse as your chancellor, or giving birth to the anti-christ. Also, being an absolute tyrant and just murdering your way to the top.Why not discover the ""What if"" part of history, reclaim the Old Roman Empire, make Britain actually conquer the world, kill the pope, conquer the papacy, restore the persian empire.

												Do I recommend this game?Yes, truly I do. Its an awesome game. It develops every single aspect of a strategy game set in the past that are left out of other games. You can have families, friends, allies, non-aggression pacts. You can imprison, execute and banish annoying vassals, you can marry yourself with the daughter of the King of England, and  through the descendants of that union get a claim on his lands. The game is varied, as you an set your game in various time periods across history with hundreds of different factions. You can be a Mongolian Khan or a Holy Roman Emperor just as much as you can be a count in Iceland with no wealth, armies or power. In most strategy games, who YOU in an empire is mostly irrelevant. In the CIV series you're simply a great leader of your nation that rules it forever. Or in the Total war series, you can have a defined character bu everything about him is mostly out of your control or irrelevant. in CK2, all the focus is on your family, as it should be. Your daughters can be married to secure alliances or become great rulers in their own right. Your sons can lead your armies, and can be giving titles you win through war. Some of your sons will love you, others will only try to seize power for themselves. Every single character as a personality, related to their trait that ACTUALLY MATTERS. Be a jerk, become a tyrant and people will hate you, resent you and might even try to murder you This world feels organic and you truly feel a part of it. For all of those reasons, I recommend this gameHoweverIt cant be denied that this game unfortunately has TONS of issues that affect game play. The kind of which will make you want to scream at your screen at how stupid what just happened was. Complete nobodies who actually like you will have you murdered for no reason or  will get themselves 20000 men armies out of nowhere to attack you even tough they don't have a penny on them or apparent claims on your lands. The AI can be incredibly stupid! They cant ever hold on to a king title without being crushed by continuous groups of rebellious vassals. After a century, ever single important christian kingdom will have an elective system of law. Why? Because its what theirs vassals want and the AI cant handle rebellions. You want to battle certain foreign dynasties across history? Too bad, the AI is also incompetent at keeping themselves alive for any long periods. Most great houses in say, 1066 will have disappeared in a bout a century  which COULD be considered historically accurate but at the same time it makes you feel like you're playing this game alone with no actual competition. The AI for the pope can be brain dead. Calling crusades against Kingdoms in India, forcing crusaders to cross the Persian desert to reach their target!The DLC in this game is horrendous. Its DLC whoring that's EA worthy. You have to pay for portraits and songs in the game!!! PURE AESTHETICS STUFF THAT DOESNT CHANGE GAME PLAY. Are you sick of hearing the same 2 god damn songs in repeat? Pay money.The worst about those DLC is what they offer. Without paying extra, you cant play pagans, you cant play Indians, you cant play muslims and you cant play republics. Thats right, more than half of the starting areas are impossible for the player to play unless they pay extra. Others are simply broken and as such are complete rip offs AND THANK GOD I never bought some of them!! They allow you for 5.49 $ to customize your ruler on regular mode BUT not on Ironman mode. But, thats something you could ALREADY DO THROUGH THE CONSOLE. Its vastly useless! The Way of life DLC makes every single male in your kingdom horny dogs that go after your wife, your heirs wife etc... which means, in a game about dynasties ruling across history, your son might just be the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ son of some random count who, thanks to the seduction focus, repeatedly slept with your wife 35 times right under your nose. The ONLY way to make sure your wives don't end up sleeping with every single man in the Kingdom is to pick a chaste one (trait that I rarely see and that they often end up losing) or a lesbian. Apparently, according to paradox, all women were ♥♥♥♥♥s in these times! Seeing how they refuse to truly fix this, thats the only conclusion I can arrive to. They tried to with a new ""reject seduction attempts"" system but since theres always a few master seducers running around it doesn't stop anyone. The conclave DLC makes the game way harder and sooo much less fun. The Republic DLC forces you to use seniority succession and nothing else! Always playing 75 years old? isnt that fun???The Sword of Islam dlc should've been in the base game, same for the old gods. There's no excuses to leave so many factions unplayable even at an 1066 start. Theres also new updates. Lots of complaints about the new update regarding coalitions that can make pagans, muslims and christians band together against you because you took a duchy through a religious war. They NEVER make coalitions USEFUL agaisnt the AI, this feature is SOLELY used to stop the player from expanding, forcing you to wait 30 f*cking years for infamy to go off unless youre willing to fight 8 nations at the same time. Shattered retreats make your enemies armies magically undestroyable while they basicly have safe conduit back to their territories. Which means, wars now drag for SO FREAKING longer than they need to because you can't kill their armies! You cant pursue them either because you will never have enough supplies and risk losing men needlessly. Sometimes, your own armies will retreat at the WORST POSSIBLE PLACES. When you raid a coast with boats and your raiders gets defeated, they sometimes retreat further in the AIs territory even tough their boats is RIGHT THERE. Theres as of date NO OPTION to turn those off. You dont like them? too bad. You have to use mods on the workshop and disable ironman mode to be able to play without themIn short?? This game offers SO much and at the same time sucks the fun out of the game with questionable design decisions, horrible dlc, and annoying AI. Is the game fun? Yes. Of course it is. But after several hours, you realize all the shortcoming of this game and you're bound to be annoyed by them. Btw, buy this game on a sale, that game is often on sale at 40% or 30% off (cant remember the percentage) Yet every other day its over 200$ to acquire the ""full experience"". Just wait a little while and get it on sale			"

												Loved this game, I considered it one of the best games I ever played. I also liked some of the major DLC such as The Old Gods, Rajas of India and Charlemagne. Even DLCs that added things I felt should have been there at the start such as Sword of Islam did improve the game. Hell I even liked Sunset Invasion because it made gameplay more interesting in the west even if it is nonsensical. A few of the DLCs did make the game better. There's also some enjoyable mods such as the GOT mod and the Elder Kings mod. I also love many of Paradox's games. It should have been impossible for them to turn me into an annoyed customer.That said the devs have simply made to many changes with patches and DLC that have just made CK2 a lot less fun and they're going to continue changing it. At a certain point all their changes were doing was make everything take longer and be more frustrating to do. The changes to the council, shattered retreats and coalitions for example just make the game more tedious. If the changes you're adding don't make the game fun but just make it last longer then what is the point? All you're doing is annoying the people that are playing and buying your products; you get sick of them changing the game for the worse. That's all without mentioning waiting for them to fix bugs in their new updates, DLC and the ton of cosmetic and sound DLC for the game. The other fact is it must be so offputting for someone thinking of buyng the game fresh. There's just too much DLC. I cannot imagine how offputting all the DLC must be to a new player I mean what is there like 50+ now? I don't get how Paradox don't get that seeing a £30 game with 50+ DLCs with a price of £122 is extremely offputting especially to new players or players that didn't keep up with the DLC. I love CK, EU, HOI and like Victoria but I'll not buy another paradox game. They seem to enjoy releasing DLC after DLC that eventually just end up changing the core gameplay for the worse by making the games more frustrating and take longer. On top of that a lot of the DLC seems to change minor things yet are priced the same as the stuff that makes significant changes.They've ruined EUIV imo, CK2 isn't ruined YET but they've definitely made the game worse than it was and since they're apparently going to be releasing even more DLC for it at this point I've basically braced myself for the game to go more and more downhill. So basically I'll never by another one of their games because I know they'll release DLC after DLC that will eventually suck the fun out of the game I liked. They change things that don't need changing and add things the game was better of without and it's frustrating watching a game you like become worse. If it ain't broke don't fix it would be a good principle for Paradox to start following :(.			"

												While I love this game and have played it more than any other game in my entire life, I am nonetheless extremely disappointed with the Conclave DLC. The funny thing is, I haven't even purchased it - meaning I can't put my review on its page - but parts of it have still seeped into my game anyway.Shattered retreat is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and does nothing except pointlessly prolong already one-sided wars. The decreased opinion bonuses from vassals make them a hundred times more of a pain in the ♥♥♥, and they seem to remain in factions against me even when their opinion of me is extremely high. I've heard plenty of other complaints about the proper DLC as well, like ruining the child education system and making the council as reasonable as a brick wall.It's unfortunate, really. This is such a great game, but this DLC has accentuated everything I didn't like about it and added virtually nothing in return. I can't imagine what Paradox was smoking when they made this, but until they get their act together, I can't recommend a purchase.			"

												This was my experience:Play a few games but I don't really understand the game. Finally after an hour and a half of going throught the tutorials a second time I figure it out. Start up an empire in Iceland. I don't bother anyone. I marry a Danish girl and help out my father-in-law with a rebelion and a small war but I don't really cause any trubble. The king of Norge (Norway) keeps wanting to start wars though. One day I get a letter, he wants peace as long as I fly his flage. Seeing as my wife was sick and had died a month before and her father was now losing a war I did not have the gold to help him win I had no other choice but to submit and accepted Norge rule. Immediatly the King of Norge invites me to his grand feast. He treats me well and offers me protection and safety. Alpha as ♥♥♥♥ King of Norge fights the Scots who have been bothering me for years. I ask if my son can marry his beautiful daughter who will one day be the Queen of Norge, and without question or hesitation he sends his daughter to Iceland and congradulates me on entering the family. WIth this my son is happy and I can concentrait on my kingdom. Over the next few years I build up a great army and nearly 1000 gold in wealth. However, I am an old man. I fear the fate of my father, I fear that soon I will die. The King of Norge is not a young man either anymore. One day I get another letter. The King of Norge is plaining to invade Scotland. Seeing as my other son married Godwinson (The King of England)'s daughter I was prepared to invade Scotland and claim all of  England and thus most of northern Europe for the King of Norge. I constructed a fleet of ships, hired thousands of men from the country side and some extra mecenaries just in case, and set sail. This time I was prepared for battle, I knew what would come. It was minutes laters as I prepaired my assault that I watched a Scotish fleet came from the deep ocean and landed on my shores and slaughter my people. Half of Scotland fought me in Scotland while the other half banded together and invaded my homeland of Iceland. And that folks is the story of how Crusader Kings II gives you a cookie, lets you eat it and enjoy it before slaping you across the face and wash your mouth out with soap and hot sause. And I'll be god damned if it wasn't the most fun I've ever had. I laughed and I cried. I was filled with joy and then crushed with defeat. I was a king...I was THE KING...and then I was nothing...11/10 would loose everything again			"

""Get new stuff!""Crusader Kings 2 is a game where you play as a dynasty with no true goal but survive and prosper in any way until the game ends at 1453.You can start anywhere from the High Middle Ages during William's conquest of England to the Late Middle Ages, during the rise of the Ottomans, and play as anyone minus the DLC-requiring peoples, even a vassal of someone else or a little count to rise to victory.The game offers an entire Europe of filthy infidels and christians to convert and conquer, but as you incorporate more vassals and peoples, your risk of civil war will increase, making the conquest of the known world difficult but possible.You can change succession laws so when your character dies like every filthy king does, you won't have trouble with how the hell the crown keeps itself together when you die. Some kingdoms start with Gavelkind, where your kingdom is split among your children, making the conquest of several kingdoms and the stabilization of the world under your rule a farfetched idea, while others may have more proper succession laws.Endless conquest doesn't exist unless everything is lined up; you need an actual reason to take the lands of your filthy heretic enemies. Someone from your Council can fabricate claims to claim that god damn one person, while if there's a filthy infidel on your borders, you can declare a Holy War (unless you're pagan but i think that's dlc required) to take a big chunk of that filthy infidel's land, but risk his fellow infidels defending their INFIDEL religion.The Pope might also call a Crusade to attack an enemy of Christianity or reclaim the Holy City, while the Caliph of an Islamic belief can call a Jihad. Back at home, you can have marriage ties with other nations to get them to be allied to you for future conquests.Is there an insubordinate vassal about to revolt? Rally those who hate him and those who love you in a plot to end his disobediant life! Of course, it's just been revealed that you plotted to kill him, so now everyone knows you've tried to murder him and he hates you.Your neighbour's heresy got him excommunicated, better not ♥♥♥♥ off the pope.The Pope called a crusade on you! better not ♥♥♥♥ off the pope.The Pope just sent you money for killing the Muslims! Now you can kill more Muslims!Oh.Oh...you've just been conquered by the Mongols.well, all of it has been in vain.And that doesn't even scratch the surface!			"

												Imagine being the king of a small European country in the 1400s. Also imagine that you're a homosexual, socially inept dwarf with a penchant for naval strategy. Now imagine your wife is being unfaithful with your overambitious brother who is planning to assassinate you and take your throne, but before he can carry out his plans you are accidentally killed during a fox hunt and your 5-year old daughter takes the throne. This is Crusader Kings II, and you know you want it.			"

												Scene: The Duke of Edessa, finally recovering from a recent Muslim invasion and the wounds suffered from it, invaded by the neigboring Byzantine Empire. His armies are crushed and his son is captured and castrated. He loses the war and is left as a one provice minor. He catches the plague and goes insane. He vows his revenge. 100 years later another Duke of Edessa and Antioch, now a vassal of Byzantium, begins revenge for the misfortunes of his ancestor. First he weasles his way into the current Emperor's inner circle and gains his trust. He then seduces all of his daughters and has a child with one of them. He then kills all of the sons of the Emperor, while luckily not being caught. He then recognizes the illegitimate child as his own. He then kills his wife and marries the byzantine emperor's daughter, who promptly dies of syphilis. He then  marries the daughter of the HRE thus forming an alliance with them. He then bides his time until the Empire is at its weakest point. The wait was not long, since 5 years later the Caliph of the Sunni faith called a Jihad for Anatolia. The emperor won the Jihad, but at the expense of most of his armies. The Duke, after waiting patiently for so long struck at the rival family. He raised all of the men of the land and used every last coin enlisting the help of mercenary bands. They marched towards Constantinople to meet the Imperial forces. After winning the battle the duke laid siege to the city. Just as the war was about to be won, syphilis struck again not only killing the duke, but his sons as well, leaving the fate of the dynasty and the war in the hands of a 62 year old, possessed, insane and childless relative. All hope was beginning to fail as the war took a turn for the worst. Then in final attempt at survival he sent the last of his armies to face the larger byzantine force. Then in a stroke of luck during the battle, his troops we able to capture the emperor and his last surviving son. He then in a bout of madness castrated all of his prisoners including the emperor and his son. The war ended and the emperors daughter took the throne, the 62 year old then attempted to seduce woman multiple times until finally it suceeded after his 65th birthday. A sickly, clubfooted, imbicile child was born, who the duke legitimized. He then killed the childs mother and himself leaving the young 1 year old as emperor. The duke's revenge finally seemed complete, until the one year old died from syphilis. (I have no idea how he got syphilis)10/10 would syphilis again			"

												Don't get me wrong. This game is pure heroin. It's so addictive. I have about 400 hours off-clock.It's just the amount of DLC this game has that makes me not recommend it. It's worse than Civ V. The main game is worthless. If you want to actually play the game, you must buy at least some of the DLC.Stay away until the price drops... a lot. More than -75%, if you ask me. No reason to support this kind of shameful business, where the game is cut to pieces and then each piece is sold separately for a small fee.			"

												For those that are a fan of in-depth medieval strategy games of epic proportions, intriguing story building, and economic growth - this game is perfect for you.Crusader Kings II is incredibly intellectually stimulating, highly versatile and before you know it, you will become an expert of medieval geography, warfare and history just through having oodles of fun and trying to figure out how to make it through the next month.

												The first thing I did as the King of England was assassinate the King of Scotland. It wasn’t for any particular reason. I had just started running the game for the first time, and wanted to check out the King of where I actually lived. But then I saw the assassinate button. I pressed the assassinate button. There was suddenly a dead Scottish monarch and a massive civil war.Crusader Kings II is a ‘Grand Strategy Game’ by Paradox Entertainment, a lovingly created, complex board game of Europe, where you play as historical character. Unlike other strategy games, where you’re the godly hand that guides a country or force, here you’re a Count, Duke, King or Emperor, with all the extra complexities and joys that brings. You have to handle your lineage – marry, have children, assassinate children, change succession laws – so that the game continues. It is the only must in CKII: create an heir, or on death without one, it’s game over. The rest is really up to you. You could try and forge the Empire of Hispania as one of the Spanish Catholic kings, unifying the other catholic nations there and driving out the Muslim rulers. You could play peacefully as the King of Scotland in a different game, only stooping to war when vassals rebel for their own claims on your kingdom. With certain DLC, you could play as Muslim rulers in Africa and Saudi Arabia, Pagan rulers, or even as a patrician, vying for control of the sea highways and port to get the most profit possible.The board deserves some explanation also: unlike many other strategy games, which use hexagonal or square tiles, here real counties are used, such as Gowrie, Cumberland, Middlesex, Badajoz, Leon, and Maine. And they aren’t just bits of land to get to make your Kingdom look bigger: they hold cities, castles and religious buildings that will increase the size of you or your vassal’s levies (army) when annexed and your income, from tax. You can even improve and build new holdings in these counties, to increase both of these. This is one of the many ways you spend your gold, along with creating kingdoms and duchies, hiring mercenaries, bribing the pope (yup!), assassinations, ect.Though out the game, you will be collecting this gold from the taxes, which is the commodity you will be using most often. Also throughout your characters life, he’ll gain Prestige and Piety: both add to your end game score, which you can use to measure just how well you’ve done after playing all those hundreds of years. Both also act like currencies, with you gaining prestige and piety from certain wars and events, but losing them with other events such as destroying kingdom titles (prestige), creating empire and kingdoms (piety) and reforming pagan religions (piety). Upon your characters death, they add to your score – not, however, a reason to die early.War is enjoyable in Crusader Kings II, but possibly not as important as in other strategy games. You can’t declare war, willy nilly. You must have a cause for war, the ‘cassus belli’. This at first feels very restrictive, as in some catholic countries, the only clear way to expand into neighbouring catholic nations is through the slow fabrication of a claim on the county. But eventually it blossoms into the complex strategy, as you juggle where to war with, with what cassus belli, to what end. It becomes delightfully full of opportunities. The Catholic Kingdoms can declare Holy Wars against Pagans and Muslims and claim their land, along with participating in the Crusades the Pope occasionally calls. You also have ‘De Jure Claims’, where you can conquer counties and land that belongs to the predefined ‘de jure’ duchies, kingdoms and empires, depending if you are a Duke, King or Emperor. Pagans can conquer any bordering counties, or subjugate entire kingdoms once in a life time. There is a treasure trove of reasons to war. And with your army, you can choose who leads the armies, and whether to engage them in battles against other armies, or to siege enemy provinces in the war. But it isn’t the only way to gain land: ensuring you’re the heir to the kingdom through assassinations and plots; through offering vassalization to the weaker, smaller independent rulers nearby. But wars are one of the more enjoyable points in the game, as long as you know how to handle them. There really is no better feeling than slowly building your independent duchy into a sprawling Empire over the years.It is important to say that all the rulers on the map are actively acting towards their own goals, with the games superb AI letting hundreds of characters act and change Europe, even in places far from where you are playing. It is sometimes enjoyable to pause the game, and just look around the map, at what’s happening far away. Seeing distant kingdoms fracture, far of empires grow, really gives the game a sense of scale that is great.And in multiplayer, you can have friends play in any of the Kingdoms, replacing one of the AI rulers. It can be incredible fun, with you playing as different Kingdoms, competing as you expand. You can choose whatever way you want to play with friends – you can assassinate them, declare war on them, or offer to join their wars. If they play as the same culture or religion, you may want to help them, to spread it, or fulfil goals that will help you all. With me and a friend playing Norse Pagans (Old Gods DLC), we started trying to expand my kingdom so that it controlled enough holy sites to reform the religion and grant us much needed security for successions. We’ve also had to aid each other during widespread civil and international war and bail each other out. It’s incredibly satisfying to bail your friends’ kingdom out of an independence war, and know they owe you one when you want to take over a nearby kingdom.The downsides of the game is the initial bafflement due to the complexities of how to combine all the systems for your own benefit, and the occasionally irritation caused by wars for the kingdom after succession. Multiplayer also requires all other players must download the host save file every time they play, which can be a slow, but is thankfully all handled in game.This game is one for those who wish to carve a story and a kingdom out of Europe, and are willing to learn through all the complexities and systems to do so. Once the game finally clicks and you’re away with it, it really is a magnificent game. Whole heartedly recommended.			"

												Some people bad-mouth this game saying the dlc costs too much or that they should fix this and that before adding in more. But for me a game that 150 euro (or 250 if you buy the dlc later) it been worth it, why, becuse Crusader kings 2 has given me over 1k hours (So far). That's a lot. You'd had to play more than 40 days straight non stop to catch up with that. For me crusader kings is more than a game it's a hobby. Some people spend just as much money (or more) and hours to fix a car for example. In the end it's up to you if you feel like investing time and money into it.			"

												I keep on returning to Crusader Kings II at random times, wanting to give myself a new challenge everytime.- Start an early era game and play as a Irish Cheif, just to see if I can become Emperor of Britan.- Start an mid era game and play as a vassal of a mighty sultan, and from there on try to take his place. And after that; try to convert all of Europe into Islam.- Start an early era game as a viking cheif, and turn into the mighty emperor of the skandinavian empire, which stretch all the way from Norway till rome.I keep on returning to great DLC's that don't cost much, and I can enjoy for hours and hours. And If I don't like the changes, I simply switch off the DLC...I love Crusader Kings II, my friend did good by adviceing me to try it, and I advice everyone who loves a great grand-strategy game to try Crusader Kings II, along with all it's DLC's!

To gain access to the full gamut of features available to players of this game, you'll have to spend upwards of $200. Most of the ""expansions"" for this game are in the form of $15 DLC packs that add as much content as a minor patch for similar games such as the Total War series or even Civilization.Long story short, don't buy this game unless you are willing to pay nearly $300 for the full experience.

Start out as king and lose your kingdom or achieve greatness.  Institute rule by the fist and have vassels revolt for major civil wars.  Build up your empire to have to fall apart by your heir.

												This is something of a Gateway game to take people into the genre of Grand Strategy games in my opinion, starting you in the place of a feudal lord, merchant republic patrician or as a pagan seeking to reform their faith. I think variety is one of the most important aspects in a game and this game provides hells amount of variety and then some. The scenario is constantly changing, and I literally mean constantly changing as feudal lords die, and new rulers take their place and wars coming from the thin of air to turn the balance in their favor.The game is complicated to grasp at first, and requires some dedication and willpower to see through the initial shock of all the concepts, but it can very much be compared to team fortress and all the new weapons and learning things bit by bit. Same concept of learning, and if you ever master this game there will always be Europa Universalis IV to move onto with the save converter, or if you're feeling bold, Victoria 2.Start your character fresh with ruler designer with only yourself to expand it, and in two hundred years it could become THE leading dynasty. Pick up the Old gods and take the Norse sons of Ragnar and conquer Scandanavia and maybe even Britannia, France and the Holy Roman Empire. This is the game where you aren't restricted by anything, and in a series where alternate history is the norm.Edit: My only concern is that much of the game is locked away under DLC. While I love supporting a developer like Paradox I think I should also offer warning that playing without any expansions will limit much of your variety. I started playing the game when it originally came out and bought the DLC as they came out, but the price will seem daunting to those coming into the game. If you're just coming into the game without knowing anything, I'd recommend grabbing two DLCs in particular: ""The Old Gods and The Legacy of Rome.""			"

												RIP in pieces CK2.  It was a good 4 years!Conclave patch ruined the game.  Buy and downgrade or DON'T BUY IT AT ALL.  Better yet, huehue, you know what to do. Whatever you actually decide to do, don't reward them for trashing one of the greatest strategy games ever made with the latest patch.  It's absolutely garbage in every way, from destroying the war score system to implementing extremely imbalanced laws, EVEN if you don't buy conclave, you'll still have that horrible patch ruining the game.  Oh yeah, they actually introduced coalitions into CK2 LOL.  THIS ISN'T EU4 YOU SILLY PEOPLE. WHY ARE YOU DEVELOPING THIS LIKE EU4? URGGGGHH.For the love of God, do not buy this broken game as it is.  DO NOT reward them for making extremely terrible design decisions and implementation.  If you must, downgrade and find old mod versions that are compatible with the last patch.  CK2 IS DEAD.P.S. I realize I don't sound like the most rational human being in the world.  But coming from someone with 775 hrs in the game and even more on another account, they REALLY, REALLY, REALLY messed things up this patch.  Not only that but they're also nickel and diming you for every f-ing update.  They actually released an additional CONTENT PACK for the newest dlc, conclave.  I mean, seriously, they actually did that.  /endranttl;dr, they done goofed and ruined ck2.  if you buy, figure out how to revert back to an older patch and if you want mods, figure out which previous mod versions you'll need to run on the old patch. gg paradox.

												Coming from games like the Total War series or the Civilization games, you might notice similarities to both at once. Think Medieval Total War played completely on the overview map but injected with a touch of Civs intrigue and a lot more provinces/factions. But that is barely, if ever scratching the surface. If you are a fan of Game of Thrones court politics or a history buff interested in having his own alternate timeline sandbox to play in, you are right at home.Want to be an English duke who sleeps with the king's wife and then assassinates said king to inherit his realm? You can do that.Want to start as a Hindu Indian raja and expand all the way to the Mediterranean while crushing the Arab Empire? You can do that.Want to be an ambitious Norse pagan in Scandinavia who amasses enough men to conquer Britain and impose the worship of Odin on all of Europe? You can do that too.Want to be a Zoroastrian prince in the Asian steppes who marries the princess of another khan but also has a b:astard son he got with his own sister? Guess what? Fair game. Before said description drives you to buy everything, be forewarned. 1.If this is your first grand strategy game, you have a bit of a steep learning curve in the beginning that, once surpassed, simply makes the game ""click"".  I absolutely recommend a must watch tutorial by Arumba on Youtube that does a far better job explaining stuff than the otherwise solid in game tutorial. You also might want to start as an Irish count in 1066 to get a hang of the game mechanics. 2. The base game has come a long way since launch and you can have a solid amount of fun with just it in your library. But the meat of the game and the huge range of choices is locked behind DLC. That wouldn't be too much of an issue if there weren't so many of them. I would absolutely not recommend paying full price for everything - sales are your friends as they usually group a bunch of DLC together for a fair price. You also don't need many of the flavour DLC. If you do buy the base game and decide to get the DLC gradually and later, for the safety of your wallet and for the biggest wealth of content, two are a must and are not expensive in sales - Sword of Islam and the Old Gods. Both unlock previously unplayable factions (aside from India) and Old Gods gives you an earlier starting date in the 9th century which many consider the best one (I tend to agree as Charlemaigne, while starting even earlier, isn't well balanced or pretty to look at). The rest you will get will be mostly based on your interests as each expansion tends to target one group of factions and mechanics.If you do have all or most of its content, you might agree with me that this is the most content packed and interesting role playing experience you have or will play in a long time. Simply for the amount of fun, investment and character immersion it is as of now my absolute favorite game of all time, faults and all. If the two points above don't scare you off, give it a chance and you will be heavily rewarded. What is more, the game is probably the best intro to grand strategy games you can find. Europa Universalis IV is another game from the same developer focusing on the Early Modern Era and it has an interesting feature where you can continue your CKII saves in a new time period, potentially making your game last for over 1000 in game years.Join in and welcome to CKII! Deus Vult!			"

												It's just awesome!This is one of the best game I've ever played so far. It's a strategy game in real time with the pause button :-)It's a sandbox game though there aren't specific targets, but you have to set your own goals, but you'll find yourself reviewing them continously adapting your strategy to either planned or unexpected events.In the game it's well represented the feudal system of the middle age, though you can start playing as Count, Duke, King or Emperor and therefore ramp up and grow your domain size caring about relationships within your own realm, your vassals and the court members, but also building alliances with other rulers via weddings.When you start a new campaign, you pick a ruler between 1066 and 1421 (Christians in vanilla, other rulers unlockable via DLCs like muslims, sea republics and pagans) and the target is to make your dinasty becoming more and more powerful. It's possible to start from 867 with ""The Old Gods"" DLC.You're noble then you should manage only castles or county having a castle in the capital (you could play as mayor if you have The Republics DLC).There are 3 types of character in the game nobles, religious and mayors which manage different types of holding and contribute to their liege's economy and armies in different ways. You can't have under your direct control all your lands, because any ruler has a limited number of holdings (demesne limit), beyond that you get huge penalty in relationships. You can earn other titles in many ways: you can inherit some lands if you're the heir of the relative title;you can speed up when this happens via plotting or assassination of the title holder or why not all the line of succesion before of you;you can push claim raising war, or even fabricate some or use claims of your vassals or relatives to raise the war and expand your realm;or why not decide to have your own antipope, which you can install, therefore having a really thankful pope, and in some conditions it will be even your vassals.For catholics the pope plays an important role, because it can excomunicate you or others, call for crusades, conceding divorces or granting you possibility to invade and therefore seize some other title.The game has also elements from RPGs, indeed any characters has 5 skills: diplomacy, martial, stewardship, intrigue and learning. And many traits either phisical traits or behaviour ones.  You can try to change skills and traits via proactive actions (ambition and plotting) or via casual events.Each ruler has a council of 5 people which helps them with specific matters: chancellor for diplomacy, marshall for armies, steward for the finance, spymaster for the intrigues and court chapelan for religious issues.There are other aspects in the game like buildings, technology research and ... All of these can be done either in single player or mutiplayer!So I've just tried to mention the most important to give an idea of what game you'll play, you're advised that this game has a steep learning curve.I warmly suggest to read the manual, see some let's play and then expirementing, and look for advices, but once you start mastering the game you'll get all the satisfaction and you'll find yourself sinking hours playing without even notice it.

The amount of content is insane (with new content being offered every few months), the updates are frequent, and the game play itself is extremely deep and rewarding.  There are time when I get the urge to play and I refuse to allow myself to because I know that if I start up another game I'll be playing it for the vast majority of my free time for the next several weeks.The game has so much to it that I couldn't even begin to do it justice without writing a ten page paper so I'll leave it at this: if you're a fan of strategy games, get this one!

												I have played this game for over 400 hours. Expanded my Empire from one small Baltic tribe. Expanded real Baltic religion to nearly all north Europe. Then - wham! New patch! Patch which broke all game system. Technology points were all gone, vassal opinions were all gone or of some enourmous amounts. Prestige points, piety points, score points, all gone or of enourmous amounts too. Contacted Paradox, asked for help - got replay that game system changed becouse of the latest patch.Okey I thought to my self, scew these 400 hours or carefull planning and conquest. I will start anew, better Baltic Empire. Not to mention the pain with Viking leaders/founders of Kiev rus and Novgorod, which are imba, packed with stats like on uber steroids, but they also get a huge packs of army right from the start. So I had to defend from them. Plan my battle carefully. Picking a place and time. I beat them in first battle and made them retreat and then - wham! New mechanic - ""Shattered Retreat"".""Shattered Retreat""So that imba unber steroid packed doom ball just retreated and I had to chase them all the way to their lands. Till I got to them, they have already recovered in morale and received reinforcements. I nearly lost that other battle. And it happened again - they just made Shattered Retreat again! And again I had to run around threw all the map just to get into same doom ball with full morale and reinforcements! But by that time my vassals were mad at me because I took their armies for too long and my gold account was empty.I have bought nearly all DLCs for this game. It's roughtly 250 EUROs and I get this, Paradox?!So this is what you developed all this time using your player community money, Paradox?!I am stating very clearly for the new commers - DONT BUY THIS GAME !!! You will be scewed up time after time and after time.Shattered Retreat mechanic was a last nail into the coffin that I am putting this game into, Paradox. You failed miserable... just pathetic.EDIT No.1: Tried to find some solution to this ""Shattered Retreat"" crap. Looked all over the internet: Reddit forums, Paradox forums, YouTube, etc. The only working solution I found was on Steam Workshop mod called ""Normal Retreat"".But guess what?! After activating it, my savefile Ironmode got corrupted. This means I can't do/complete any game achievements! Well done Paradox! I tried a new game, same thing! Well done, Paradox!!! Standing ovations!Looks like Total War games from now on.			"

I would not even poke this game with a stick unless you find a good discount price, but to buy a incomplete game at near triple A price, is absolutely dirty.			"

												Where to begin.. I'll begin with the bad. This developer is probably the most guilty of nickle and diming it's customers for DLC. Just look at the price tag of this game 159 USD?? I'm sorry, but no game no matter how good it may or may not be is not worth such a price tag.  So, no I would never recomend this game, nor any game made by Paradox due to it's policy of overpricing, and diving small bits and bobs they've released later after the initial release of the game when they should have bundled most of the dlc available into a proper expansion pack as an honest game developer would instead of taking advantage of the consumer.                    The base game is good enough, the graphics aren't great but not everyone is worried about that. It's good strategy fun but at such a price, no. Do not buy this game, it's only driving prices for our games higher and higher, its bad for the industry and even worse for the consumer.			"

												I would have recommended this game right until the most recent patch. Expanding into an empire becomes nearly impossible as you try and fight off the entire planet in a holy war for one county.The recently added coalition feature might not be a bad idea but its implementantion is appalling. After pressing your claims on a neighbouring area (be that be a county, duchy or kingdom) you find yourself in a similar situation as 1938 Nazi germany. The whole world hates you and is ready to start a world war at a moments notice. The pope will join muslims and pagans alike in this global war against you (despite the fact you are a devout christian) and you will soon find yourself fighting on 4000 fronts at once in a war for a SINGLE province. Rather silly.Do not buy this game in its current state.			"

I've never felt the desire to cancel on plans or dates with other people due to intriguing events occuring in my realm.

												At first the DLC expansions sounded like a good idea.Then they started breeding faster than the Zerg.I stopped playing the game altogether because it always feels incomplete since I can't afford to buy all the (gameplay) DLCs at the rate they are putting them out.To top things off, Paradox stopped putting DLCs on a 75% off discount, and you can hope for 66% at most. Doesn't sound like much of a difference, but hey, 1000x 1 euro is a lot.Unless the publisher puts out a DLC bundle (which gives you a discount based on how much DLCs you already have) I'll probably never play this again.Whew, managed to go throught the review without comparing them to EA and Ubisoft.

												This game's learning curve is not just steep... the tutorial is garbage and only slightly grazes the major aspects of the game (it doesn't go into any of the in-depth mechanics that the game so notably advertises about, and it definetly doesn't do a good job at teaching how to play).I play all genres of games and am used to learning strange and odd game mechanics.  I am 30 years old and have been gaming since the original Atari console.  When I read reviews about this game I wasn't phased by everyone saying the learning curve was steep.  I have owned mostly every major game console released, as well as have played a few years worth of game hours in PC games.  On top of that, I have played dungeons and dragons (the dice version with a DM/GM), I have played text-based games such as the original kings quest... I have played many board games, book games, card games... etc... What I am trying to allude to is that I am an experienced gamer with above-average technical and troubleshooting abilities; usually I am the one my friends go to when they need help with figuring something out.I have spent close to 3 hours in the game and still feel I have no control over what is going on within the game, nor do I feel I have a solid grasp on how to gain control over what is going on within the game.  I understand not being able to just pick up a game and master it... but 3 hours is too long to spend in a game to still be constantly feeling at a loss in trying to do something and not being able to do it.  I can play the game, but I in-no-way enjoy constantly feeling frustrated because I'm trying to do something that I can not do.I no longer have the time I had when I was younger to play games, so when I play a game, I want to enjoy it.  I feel I would need to invest a minimum of 10 hours into this game, just to have a solid grasp on how to play it.  That is too much for me, considering most modern non-rpg games can be beaten in less than 10 game-hours.I'm not saying I'm not willing to invest hours into a game, as I've invested close to 120 game-hours into some of my games... but I have searched for more reviews and people, like me, have also had major difficulties in understanding how to manipulate the game (even when some people who are experienced in playing the game helping them).For me... with the horrible tutorial... the insanely large amount of ""buy in"" time required to learn the game... this game just isn't worth it.  There are many easier-to-play and more in-depth games out there similar to this.			"

												Was playing online with friend. Seduced friends wife but got caught in the act. Friend castrated me as a punishment. 10/10 would give friends wife syphilis again.It should be called Walder Frey simulator 2014. Seriously everyone seems to get assassinated at weddings, your spy master is constantly telling you that people are homosexual and you should execute them, your wife is trying to kill you for no reason at all, your 4 year old daughter is married to a 62 year old dwarf from northern Africa, everyone is in incestuous relationships, and you have no idea what is going on. 10/10 game!At first a lot of people are put off by the presentation of this game (those who don't play Paradox Grand Strategy Games that is). The closest the majority of gamers (apologies for the generalisation) have gotten to a strategy game is Total War, Age of Empires or Civilisation; games that keep their audiences interested by dumbing down the complexities and keeping audiences hooked with visual entertainment through battle sequences (Please note, I am not criticising; I am a huge fan of these games).CK2 on the other hand is a colourful map, on first viewing, at best. This is a game that, at first glance - and I'm extending that time period out to your first 2-4 hours with it - seems like a cold, number-driven strategy game. Something only grognards can enjoy, in between tabletop wargame sessions and forum arguments over the finer points of Napoleon's invasion of Russia.And to be fair to first glances, it is. This is a Paradox grand strategy game, one that doesn't just crunch numbers, it grinds them to dust, sprinkles them across 11,715 buttons and menu options and feasts on them. It's an intimidating game to come to grips with, in no small part because Paradox are so terrible at tutorials, and almost as bad at creating intuitive user interfaces.Stick with it, though, and my. Oh my. What begins as a blind exercise in clicking things and getting your ♥♥♥ kicked all over Europe slowly begins to blossom. You start to realise what those little ""lustful"" and ""deceitful"" character traits on every character mean. You realise that the marriage system is an entire mechanic built into the game, not some pointless piece of window dressing. It clicks that, outside you own little fiefdom, the game is populated by every single noble, religious figure and courtier across Europe (and most of the Middle East).In short, you realise that this isn't a game about war, or empires, or money, or some pre-anointed goal you must achieve to be the ""winner"".It's a game about people. And the relationships between them.So why is it so addicting? That's simple, because it's the only game to have ever been developed (successfully) that's about sex and politics.Most others are about killing. And don't get me wrong, as head of a medieval dynasty, there will be the blood of thousands on your hands when your game is done.But in Crusader Kings II, unlike most other games - its strategy brethren especially - the wholesale murder of your enemies is but a sideshow. A diversion. The hammer you break out when all other approaches to victory have failed.You don't play Crusader Kings II as some disembodied hand, guiding the fate of a people. You play as, literally, a character within the world, part of a medieval dynasty. You can marry. Have kids. Send them off to be educated. Educate them yourself. Choose your own council. Assassinate people. Arrest people. Chop the head off the people you arrested. Arrest their kids, who revolt after you chopped their father's head off. Ask the Pope to excommunicate them. Arrange your kid's marriages. You can even invite people over for dinner.Every time you do one of these things, your relationships with people change, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. They'll remember your past betrayals, and respect your past achievements. So aside from juggling the economy and the military of a Kingdom, you'll be spending as much (if not more) of your time juggling politics.And it's amazing. It's not until you're knee-deep in ♥♥♥-kissing and horse-trading (well, daughter-trading) that you realise, in all likelihood, you've never done something like this before. At least not something like this that works. And it really does work. Sure, it's based on numbers - quite literally, with each character screen giving you two numerical values, one reflecting another's opinion of you, the other, your opinion of them - but those numbers are just the game's way of communicating the complexity of the relationships, and you soon overlook them, reading past the values and seeing the overall feelings and sentiments driving them.From the mightiest empire to the lowliest county, you'll need to keep tabs on those closest to you, lest someone sneak in one night and poison you. Or stab you. Either or. If they do, well, it's game over.Oh, wait, it's not. Because this is Crusader Kings II we're talking about here, and it's smarter than that.When I said you're playing as part of a dynasty, that was only partially true. You are, but you're actually in control of the dynasty itself. So when your first character dies, provided they have a dynastic heir - whether that be a child or close family member - you take over as them, assuming control of not only a new character, but all their own personality traits, history, family and, most important of all, relationships.Say you're the King of England. You're loved in all corners of the land. But then, one day, you fall from your horse and are suddenly killed. Your son takes over, you think everything is gravy, but then... oh dear. Turns out your son is a homosexual, something jealous enemies can blackmail him (well, you, now) over. You're a coward. A weak ruler. Your wife, probably because of the whole sexual orientation thing, won't give you heirs.Before you know it, a once-happy Kingdom is in turmoil as power-hungry nobles attempt to overthrow you. You scrape your armies together, begin to crush the rebellion, advance on the final enemy, and then... you're killed on the battlefield. Your combat statistics weren't as good as your dad's, you see. You take control of your sole heir (who you suspected was someone else's kid anyway, since he was born while you were off fighting), a kid whose regent is even more incompetent than the last King, and before you know it, the throne is lost. You've gone from control of one of the mightiest Kingdoms in Europe to lording it over a few crummy towns.This should be game over. Or at least the point where you chuck it in, realising that there's no hope of victory from here. Only... remember, there is no victory. And there's 400 years of history to play through. It's entirely possible - and I know, because I've done it - to go from a King to a nobody and back to a King again in a few hundred years, courtesy of a slow and methodical game of revenge, of marrying the right people, cutting the right people's throats, climbing your way slowly up the ladder of political power.That scenario I just described? With heroism, tragedy, intrigue and scandal? It's just one story. From one game. In a complete playthrough of 400 years of European history, from the Norman invasion of England through to the 15th century, you'll encounter dozens more. Start your next game, even if it's in the exact same place, and it'll be a whole new experience. Start it somewhere else on the map and it'll be even more different still.The clashes of armies are just as important as clashes in the court or the bedroom, and by pinning a grand strategy game on your relationships with people, Crusader Kings II does just as good a job as George R R Martin has.Happy gaming!

												So right out the gate: Crusader Kings II is a good game. It's got scope and range in spades. The kind that you can get lost in for a dozen hours, whatever kind of gamer you might be. The mechanics are pretty versatile, fitting the sort of playthrough you're looking for. If you're one of those gamey, tournament-style players and you just 'have' to minmax to take over half the world before that turn of the century... the tools are there. More power to you.There's also some meat in here for us slow rolling guys. Come up with a neat historical premise and work it through to completion. Or get caught out and castrated by angry rivals. It's your oyster.There's also a whole lot of story going on in this completely emergent simulation. If you're like me and the thought of creating your own alternate histories gets your rocks off, then you're in luck because CKII has by far the most in-depth alt-history game out there. One start date you can create a lasting Catholic Kingdom from within the belly of the Byzantine Empire... another you can fight off William the Conqueror and retain a truly Anglo-Saxon England... or maybe you want play as Poland and take a lesson from your Slavo-Russian cousins and carve an Empire out of the Holy Roman one... Pretty grand stuff and damned rewarding in their own right. The roleplay elements are pretty slick too. The characters you play as (Moreover, their dynastic line) can get as convoluted and involved as your HBO fantasy series. The cool thing about CKII's minimalist style is that it reads a lot like a book, painting a picture in your head of vast fleets of ships and clashing armies. You start to root for these little characters as you aim for a lasting Kingdom/Empire of their very own.But this segues neatly into the game's major shortcoming. If you want a fuller experience, you'll almost HAVE to dig into DLC. It's how Paradox operates. My advice? Your best bet is to take a look at which packs are on offer and nab the ones you can see yourself getting into. Myself, I immediately went for The Old Gods expansion because I'm nuts for Vikings. As you expand your repertoire with the game, you'll know exactly where to branch out. (I also suggest getting Charlemagne if you want the ability to create your own 'original' 'new' kingdoms: like any good Alternate History buff would wanna do) It almost goes without saying that you should wait for a Steam sale if you don't want to fork over your life's savings.In the end, Crusader Kings II is far and away one of the best strategy games on the market. It's also a gateway drug for learning more about medieval history. You'll get to know everything from the Mongols to the Magyars like the back of your hand. Impress all the folks with your grasp of that sort of worldly stuff.Like I said, it's broad. You can dig into this one for 400 hours and still be surprised by the next hundred. Thumb is up.			"

												I love this game. The systems and mechanics seem to be balanced perfectly for emergent narrative. While the strategy is awesome, I find the best part of this game is the stories that develop from those systems.The depth is amazing. I’ve played over 100 hours now and have only really played one full game, and 2 half games. My first Ironman game (no loading saves) I started as Denmark. I managed gained Norway, but lost it despite assassinating tens of people in the succession line ahead of my heir. I made inroads into Sweden before taking it entirely (after the then King got taken down by a mercenary army), then married my way onto the throne of Lotharingia and used my new power to take Pomerania - in the process becoming the most powerful ruler in the Holy Roman Empire. I demanded independence from the Holy Roman Emperor who buckled before me, splitting the Empire in two. I basked in glory for several decades (holding several feasts and tournaments) before a massive continental war spanning over ten years, during which my successor lost control of Lotharingia and Pomerania. Once the dust cleared, I had to settle for being Queen of Sweden and Denmark. But you don't mind stuff like that happening - playing a count or a duke can be as much fun (and way less stressful) than being a King or an Emperor. I held onto those two kingdoms while gaining Finland, before marrying the Kaiserin of the Holy Roman Empire! Everything was coming up Chris, but then she sadly died in childbirth - leaving my son as the Kaiser. Comparisons to game of thrones in game form are not far off, in fact there is a mod (I haven't tried) and like GOT there is absolutely no guarantees of a happy ending. In my game I managed to become the Kaiser and clung grimly to the throne until the end of the game. All that in just one game - and I haven't even got the latest expansion yet, which adds India. The multiplayer is great too, playing with a friend means you can work together and there is someone there to enjoy the narrative with you, and leads you to great stuff like marrying your buddy (in the game) and then cheating on them. Or making them your Master of the Hunt. One complaint would be the learning curve, in that I had no idea what I was doing for the first 20 or so hours. Also periods (years sometimes) can go by with not a lot happening, but I just speed it up in those instances. Once you invest 25 or so hours into learning the game, the rewards are amazing.			"

												Feels great when you're playing as the King of Abyssinia and Nubia but need the kingdom of Egypt to create the Abyssinian Empire and you set up the proper marriages and your heir inherits the Byzantine Empire from your wife and your heir's heir likewise inherits the French Empire, allowing the expansion of the rightful world Empire of Great Abyssinia, stretching from Iceland to Sri Lanka.  Next game, you play as a Croatian duke and grow to take over basically everything from the Greek borders to Northwestern Spain, becoming the most powerful man in the Byzantine Empire (despite not actually being the emperor) and eventually declare independence because these ""laws"" are for lesser men.Next game, you decide to change it up and play the Game of Thrones mod and play as the Reynes of Castamere and see if you can beat the mighty Lannisters (instead of having Tywin wipe out your entire house).  After years of carefully setting up marriage alliances, you realize you may have overdone it as the combined armies of the North, the Riverlands, the Reach, and Dorne all join you to defeat the Lannisters.  But hey, as long as you have alliances with all but two of the Lords Paramount of Westeros, why not just take the Iron Throne and rule them all?Oh, don't forget the incest, murder, and seduction for seduction's sake!

												TL;DR: Crusader Kings II takes a long time to learn, so don't buy it expecting it to be something you can just jump into unless you play a lot of strategy or Paradox titles. If you have a lot of time to kill, are imaginative, and love character oriented games then this will probably be a good fit for you. There is a wide range of mechanics from choosing a spouse to trying to assassinate anyone (in the entire game, no essential characters). The DLC isn't as money-grubbing as it may appear at a glance. Not all the DLC may fit any one person's preferences, so I recommend researching what the expansions are and what they contain. I approve of this game!   Crusader Kings II is the game that I absolutely must review (133 hours and growing playtime). I will do my best to remain impartial throughout this review and to address the game as it is, while offering some opinions on things such as DLC, despite being somewhat biased. The game is rather difficult to learn at first, so if you are not a patient person or do not have the time to learn the game and want something you can just jump into, then Crusader Kings II probably isn't the game for you (it took me 8 hours to learn how to play).  On the other hand, if you like strategy titles, participating in assassination plots, conquering lands and have a lot of time to kill, then this might be a game that you'll enjoy. For the most part, I think Crusader Kings II has something to offer everyone, even the strategically challenged (like me. I'm awful at this game and therefore use console commands, but it doesn't hamper my enjoyment at all). At it's core, Crusader Kings II is more about the characters than conquering everything. Indeed, the game ends at a certain date (1453) rather than when everything is under one's thumb or certain conditions are met (excluding the date being reached). Characters have their own randomized events (often fun and quirky) that can shape their stats and relationships with each other. Events can range from having an affair to being possessed. Some events have choices, while others do not. In addition to events and the obvious fighting, there are also plots which allow you to do things like try and arrange someone's death through assassination, go on hunts, or hold a feast. I know I'm really starting to beat a dead horse here, but nearly everyone that has played multiple games of Crusader Kings II has that ONE character that sticks in their mind (mine was a guy that adopted a cat, lost an arm in battle, held a massive funeral for said cat when it passed of old age, and then died of an infection shortly after the cat's funeral). The characters of the player's and game engine's creation are something so wonderful.Some other mechanics include: Marriage (anyone of opposite gender can be married if conditions are met), Lovers (same-sex or otherwise), dungeons with prisoners that can be executed, ransomed, or released, fabricating claims on land to go to war, going to war, hiring mercenaries, converting areas to your religion, and whatever mods may add. The mod community for this game is really awesome, variety-filled and big!  One thing that I rather dislike, but makes sense, is that you have to have a Casus Belli (cause for war) to be able to declare war and go out to fight. This is either achieved by being of a certain culture, having differing religions, or a claim (fabricated or legitimate). On the bright side, this does prevent the AI from ganging up on you.Something rather off putting to a newcomer of the game, at least it was to me, is the large number of DLC. Most of the DLC is cosmetic in nature, while a few do add some changes to the game (improvements or otherwise, I'm looking at you Conclave). The really neat thing, in my opinion, about   the DLC that adds functions is that some of those functions are patched into the game for free. One such example would be India's landmass was patched into the game for free so that players may fight and conquer India, but to play as an Indian you must own the DLC. In terms of which DLC to buy, I'd say use the search engine of your choice, figure out what the expansions are, and then what they contain (if that strikes your fancy, of course). I will say that while amazing, I don't feel the DLC are necessary and that the base game provides more than enough entertainment, but they certainly are fun!			"

												Crusader Kings II is a great starting point for anyone who's been looking to get into the grand strategy genre but has been overwhelmed by Paradox's previous titles. Fairly easy to learn, and with all the gameplay improvement and alternative history mods, you'll get plenty of time for your money.As someone who's played over 500 hours in Deus Vult, I did find it a little disappointing that Ck2 didn't inflict the same amount of ungodly punishment that the previous games did; One of the best experiences in Deus Vult was getting beat down constantly and getting back up, but I'll be the first to admit it was probably for the best. Ironman is a very interesting feature that suffers slightly from the constant autosaving disrupting gameplay, but this may not be such a big issue if you have a good computer that autosaves quickly.Now one major concern is the unending horde of DLC. I really don't approve of the direction Paradox Interactive is going with their DLC for Ck2, paying for historical dynasty shields? Ehhhh.The game is priced at $40To get all the major DLC's (Expansions) alone costs $55As It stands, CK2 is not worth buying full price. Wait for a sale where the collection is 75% off and grab it.

												Backstab, fight, talk and murder your way to victory.Wow, just wow. Another hit title by Paradox, an almost certain must buy! Launch yourself into an immersive, and ever changing campaign, spanning over 500 years (providing you have the Old Gods DLC). Ever wanted to be King of England? Kaiser of the Holy Roman Empire? Or simply wanted to be a low-lying Baron? Look no further, Crusader Kings II is for you! Crusader Kings II is certainly one of the best Paradox games out there, with a whole new gameplay interface. If games like Victoria II and Europa annoyed you because the lack of character interaction, Crusader Kings II is perfect to settle that fetish of yours.Dive into the famous Godwin family in 1066, and try fight of the Norse hordes, and the Norman aggressors, or make your own House (with the ruler designer DLC), and help it rise into the anals of history. CKII has an in-depth system of character interaction, where you can do anything from sending them a gift, assassinating them, offering them vassalage, or organising a marrage, anything is possible in CkII.Buy this game, all it's DLCs, and get lost in the (almost) never-ending and ever-changing campaign, which will get you hooked from day 1, to the end-day.Enjoy!

												The title Crusader Kings 2 falls under the so-called grand-strategy games. The term is well-earned in this case and before you start the game be warned that there is a steep learning curve. Do not pick up this game if long-winded games that requires hours of hours to finish is not your thing. Do pick it up if you like games like Civilization, Alpha Centauri, or Europe Universalis. Having said that, and perhaps you do not know these titles, lets get into what Crusader Kings 2 actually is.Like all grand-strategy games Crusader Kings 2 is (but need not be, I will get back to this) for instance about creating a dukedom, kingdom, or empire, keeping those under you happy less they revolt, and creating a proper army. Unlike many other grand strategy games (outside of other Paradox titles) this game is actually historically correct for medieval europe, the middle east, and India. That is right, did you ever want to play as William the Conquerer? This game gives you that opportunity.That immediatly leads to 'need not be' clasule I said before. Unlike other grand strategy games you do not play a 'faction' or a 'nation', but you play as an individuel e.g. Ghengis Khan. The game doesn't end when you die, however, no it follows the rise (and fall) of your family as your dominion grows on the map. Depending on your succesion laws you might be playing as your oldest, youngest, or even a random family member. You might even go super modern and have daughters rule on purpose, not 'just because' the male line ended as was more the case in the time period between 769-1452 AD (which how long the games played out assuming you have two DLCs).The game features cultures (e.g. German, Anglo-Saxon, Berber, Russian, Visigothic, and Tamil) as well as religions (e.g. Hindu, Catholic, Coptic, Karasite, Tengri, Sunni, and Germanic) and this including with recently conquered, traits of a person, your history with them perhaps, can all influence what people think of you. Wil you marry out a daughter for an alliance, or perhaps with that genius of a man so you can get him to court and get a good advisor? This is all dependent upon you.Thanks to all these features, as well as the fact that once the game starts randomness kicks in and the historical accurate timeline is lost, means that you will never(!) play the same game ever again. Mechanics wise yes, but give it enough time and the map will look quiet different from last time, different kings and emperors, and perhaps e.g. the Byzantine empire might have fallen by 1100.

												Starting as Byzantine Emperor in the Viking Age in Ironman mode, I promptly began fighting off the Muslims on the border of my Empire and reclaimed several small islands. Given my huge income of 100+ gold from all my vassals, I decided to upgrade Constantinople and many of my holdings. Hours later, I mended the Great Schism by conquering Holy Lands and declaring them mine. Most of Europe became Orthodox and I removed the Pope from his seat, leaving no Christian rulers. I was then known as ""The Saint"", and gave birth to a long line of Byzantine Emperors who ruled with iron fists, seeking to return the Legacy of Rome.After years of crusading and aggressive expansion into Italy and the Middle East, I reclaimed the old Roman Borders. The Roman Empire was once more established, but Rome was not done. All the land from Constantinople to Egypt, Egypt to Spain, Spain to France, Germany, parts of Russia, and all of Scandinavia were to be conquered. I gained the S.P.Q.R achievement for restoring all that belonged to Rome and more. Much of the Middle East was conquered and pushed back. With an income of 500+ gold a month and trading posts spanning around the entire Empire, I was set.Until it all changed, the Golden Horde formed and attacked me after I just finished off the 10th civil war to lower crown authority. The Khan stole a great chunk of land, and I was seriously low on man power. The Golden Horde continued to push foward, while my army was busy fighting off civil wars and religious rises. I finally managed to win my civil wars, and was left with a few years time to rebuild my army. 600K+ troops later with a personal levy of 80K retinues, I took back what was mine and destroyed the Golden Horde. With less than 30 years left until end game, I was looking forward to saying I conquered most of the world without cheating. Yeah, not so much. My cousin forms the Kingdom of France and fights for independance, and somehow most of my Empire flocks towards him to rebel against me. My army is cut in half, and I am busy trying to fend off France while also being attacked by mysterious figures that start assassinating my bloodline. I eventually murder all of my cousins children, excommunicate him, and then murder him. I am victorious, the Great Emperor Buoso II. Little did I know, I had a falling out with the rest of my bloodline for killing a family member. My title is usurped, and I am forced to watch as my Uncle begins to lose Kingdoms worth of land to vassals rebelling against their liege. I assassinate him and try to marry my child into power, but before I can do that his son is also killed by that mysterious assassin. This leaves no rightful hier to the Empire of Rome, and it splits apart again.Every duchy, county, kingdom, and what have you in the entire world splits up into over 500+ independant states. Everyone starts fighting for power, and I sit there having just lost a game I spent over 50+ hours on. My jaw drops. My computer couldn't handle the entire world fighting and I eventually just gave up on that game. Crusader Kings II can change in the blink of an eye.10/10. I'd play that ♥♥♥♥ again.I have some pictures here (not of my final result, but showing much of the progress).http://i.imgur.com/2I9JmLT.jpg?1http://i.imgur.com/REBviYv.jpg?1http://i.imgur.com/5nLhLny.jpg?1http://i.imgur.com/pYaMvOg.jpg?1http://i.imgur.com/UHs9d9a.jpg?1http://i.imgur.com/Xcqa26M.jpg?1http://i.imgur.com/Iy0Tsj8.jpg?1 "

												CK2 is a great game, but i cannot recommend it.  paradox has changed their EULA to remove the opt-out of data collection.  as this game has been out for years, i find this change to be immoral and disrespectful to existing customers.  it's a shame, because the genra is so niche.please, dont give paradox more money till they restore customer rights and allow an opt-out of data collection.  if the data is important to them, they can ask for it instead of spying on their customers.

												This game is awesome. Start out as a little guy in Ireland and become the Emperor of the British Isles, and then lose it all in a generation and you're a count again. Except this time you're a count somewhere in Germany because on a previous character you married some German count's daughter, and he had a feud with someone who murdered all of his sons and you ended up inheriting it. Well now I guess you're in Germany so you start all over again. You fabricate some claims, and invite some claimants and land them, allowing you to take land for them that will be added to your overall realm. Eventually you're big enough and you've bribed enough people that you manage to get yourself elected Holy Roman Empire. Now the might of the Reich is going to go down upon that upstart Duke who thought he could overthrow you as Emperor of Britain.Every game can be this interesting. Try it.			"

												CKII is truly one of the finest strategy games out there. If you put in the time to get the most out of it, you will be rewarded with a deep and complex game which has endless replay value.The sense of accomplishment you can get from conquering the Holy Land, or reforming the Roman Empire, or inheriting a kingdom after decades of plotting, or simply painting the entire map your colour, is nothing quite like any other game out there.If you want the full range of experiences you will want the DLC which add new features and unlock previously unplayable characters, but even without this CKII provides a gaming experience you won't be quick to leave behind.

												One of the best grand strategy games of all times. When CK II appeared on steam was pretty much sceptical about it, but when i started to watch Northernlion's LP series i was into this game. CK II is not easy strategy game, however learning curve is quite interesting, and only will learn by trial and error as it requires to be patience. Learn to manage your county. Succeeded? Now it's time to rule as Duke or Duchess. Try plotting, scheming, bribing. Change your succession law and crown authority. Slay anyone who stands against Catholic religion, start Holy war against heretics and expand your realm.As for multiplayer, it is great feature because it allows you to play with friends and do whatever you want either coop till end of time or play against each other.Score: 10/10.

												It's a Total War game without the 3D battles. To be honest, I used to skip those battles anyway so Crusader Kings 2 is a far deeper game to play. It's not easy to get into and initially I found the amount of things I had to remember daunting. But the music and game play draw you in. Hours are soon gone and lessons learned. Superb.			"

												I felt that this game deserved me writing my first review after seeing that my time played had passed the 600hrs mark. To put it simply it is a ""what if"" game of devious backstabbing’s and marching armies with bloody family interactions. It has multiple flavors and paths to greatness and not all of them are killing your way to the top. The fact that you can change the history of Europe while truly caring what your customizable dynasty is plain awesome.			"

												-Plays multiplayer as king of Denmark with a buddy as king of Sweden. We unite Scandinavia and reform the faith. I basically become the Pagan Pope.-The King of both France and Germany (Charlemagne's empire before the creation of Holy Roman Empire) dies... last and only heir is a guy exiled in muslim Spain who converted to Allah.-King of France and germany is now muslim zealot, refuses to convert to christianity, forces most aristocrats to convert to Islam and uses them to convert the people too.-Allies himself with Muslim Spain and proclaims Jihad after Jihad on us because the Pagan holy sites we captured used to be Frankish lands. Muslims form the most powerful alliance in Europa. We hold our ground, losing and taking back Saxon lands. We pillage neighbouring lands to invest into the army when the onslaught begins anew.-Catholic brits and italians send crusade after crusade to try and retake Catholic lands to no avail. They slow the Andalus down but they keep coming to die in the frozen wastes... It has been 5 Jihads now. Around 20.000/30.000 soldiers thrown at us...EACH TIME.-We manage incredible victories due to clever strategy. We counter-attack with our own holy wars because they cannot declare war on us at their leisure during truce. I take the lands of Flanders. My friend takes Germany, I crown him Emperor of the Germanic people, bulwark of the faith.-Most of France is converted now. The holy wars still rage on, though the muslim threat is being contained by a clever use of Pagan and Christian Holy wars during muslim internal struggles in order to even the odds.-The last king of Italy dies and the Byzantine Emperor inherits the title. A new challenger joins the fray. Stronger than ever. Catholic Aquitaine revolts and with our indirect help, becomes independent.-Yet it does not end... I can already hear the warcry of the faithful heathens coming to spill our blood. Allahu Ackbar... Allahu Ackbar...Ragnarok, the end times, are coming and it's symbol is a golden crescent.10/10 Would create nightmarish dystopian far-right propaganda by accident again.			"

												Thought I'd do a proper review of this game because there are none, most are just an event description or part of someones playthrough with no information about the actual game. Or something lame like ""best game ever played. the end"" Thanks for the really helpful info guys.This is a grand strategy game similar to classics like Civilization. It's set during the Middle Ages to the High Middle Ages. You take control of (or create your own) dynasty/family and try to survive. How does it play? Slowly... very slowly.The game is essentially just a huge map with a few single soldiers dotted about representing armies. You have a few menu's with options such as changing laws (which you have to wait for 10 years to change) and there is your council who can do a few things on the map such as fabricate claims, train troops, plot etc.Conquest is not easy especially if you're catholic, as its full of realistic mechanics such as the pope in his pointy hat telling you ya can't invade good christians willy nilly. But these mechanics and the random events that pop up are what make the game shine, it makes it a much more realistic and satisfying experience and some are just plain funny but they do need to be made more flexible to make the game more playable. In order to conquer someone you need to justify it, so for example you could have your son marry a local lords daughter and when they have children they will have a claim to the lords land, that's the 3rd generation! So you spend a lot of time waiting around for events to pop up and people to do the things you assign them to, building up armies, waiting to get pregnant, waiting for the children to grow up, waiting for someone to kill the other heir ect.It's like a song of ice and fire or game of thrones the game (and not that telltale ♥♥♥♥) this has real freedom to create the imbred zealot dwarf family of your dreams, pushing kids out of windows and capturing concubines, smothering babies and that classic poisoned wine, each playthrough tells a unique story (if the events randomly pop up) but its in a realistic medieval setting (no targaryens but theres a good mod out there), history buffs should enjoy this game, especially if you're into that particular part of history. But like I warned you everything takes a VERY long time to do and most of the time you are sitting twiddling your thumbs which some will find boring.I've played this game for well over 300 hours on and offline and I do like it, in fact it can be addictive and the soundtrack is great too but unfortunately Paradox are well aware of how much of a gem this game is and do an EA - The Sims franchise style dlc system where they sell you the game in chunks and each time they bring out a new DLC they update the base game to balance it out so if you don't have the DLC I would imagine this would alter gameplay in a negative way. But at least with those sims games you get actual content. But what is the DLC in this? Not much really, they just add new functionality to the game which affects game play a bit and they can be fun but you don't really get a lot for your money. The game is just a huge map with a few crude single soldiers representing an army, all adding functionality does is create a new sub menu or events which are just text, so really you shouldn't have to pay for them and they should be in a free update as they are just a few lines of code or maybe Paradox should finish the game with the holes filled... I mean with the DLC options included in the base game instead of behaving like subscribed early access but everything is about money so what do you expect, this is why I don't recommend this game. Sorry fanboys the truth hurts and not all of us have loads of money. Wait for a sale or until Paradox have bled it dry and everyones bored of it and pick it up at a more realistic price, this game is definitely NOT worth £122.99 (14/02/2017). If you cannot wait until then this game is not for you, it's all about waiting.			"

												Crusader Kings II is a masterpiece of a game.Crusader Kings II scratches an itch that no other game can - a mix of grand strategy, RPG mechanics, and the SIMS.Crusader Kings II can, and will, keep you entertained for hundreds if not thousands of hours.Crusader Kings II is an excellent way to learn and play with history during the Middle Ages. Crusader Kings II has an incredible modding scene, community, and tradition of After Action Reports.Crusader Kings II charges an arm and a leg for the dozen or so DLC packs that expand the base game.Crusader Kings II forces you to see and interact with the content, even if you haven't bought the DLC and can't play it.Crusader Kings II has steadily gotten worse, performance-wise, as a result of this explosion of moving parts.Crusader Kings II is developed and maintained by a company that has lost their original vision and lost this customer. And that is all I can say.			"

												Where do I start. This game is addictive as all hell. It is a pure character role play orientated game where you play generation from generation of your family throughout the dark ages with everything revolving around how YOU as the player mould your character and his/her successors. This does mean that a single playthrough from just 1066 to 1453 can take in the excess of sevral days.Have you ever wanted to play as a Spaniard with Russian culture who is a staunch believer of the Zoroastrian faith and conquer Germany? In this game, you can! That is just the tip off the iceberg of insanity. I have had a succession war with my 1st born son who was also the SPAWN OF SATAN, literally a hell baby.Now understand this game can be daunting to new players especially because there are no real good tutorials provided by the game. That is definitely a shortfall and has to be made up with Youtube tutorials or experienced friends who play the game. The other problem is how random some events can be which can royally screw over a fresh game. I wont go into details but I am sure many of my fellow players can recount situations the destroyed their games. Also It pretty much a requirement to get game mechanic DLC such as Old Gods and the Republic to get the most out of the game. That is the only real problems I can think of with the game. Otherwise its an excellent game with challenges and character driven role play. Fantastic modding community always re-inventing the game and extending the hours of life this game has. I don’t think this game can be adequately compared to any other just because how unique it is.I rate this game 11/10			"

												I learned a lot of geography from this game and EU IV.Seriously, come trivia night, my geography is really on point. Capitals, country locations, rivers, I know that stuff.Which is nice.This may be the most complete and well rounded historical simulator available, and its mechanics are unique without being gimmicky. You see CK2 is about forging a dynasty, which is a fancy way of saying a rules heavy family. It's technically sandbox and you can have quite a bit of fun with it. You can roleplay as the traits that you have, or just try to make every character into Julius Caesar, or just keep assasinating popes, forever and ever. When your character dies, whether it be at 4 or 88, the play goes to the direct heir, whether he or she be 4 or 88, and you are given control over their decision making process. As long as your dynasty has not died out in terms of inheritance laws, and someone in your dynasty has a sufficient title the game will continue until it stops after maybe dozens or a hundred hours of game play. You manage titles under your realm. Count is the lowest, than Duchy, than King, than Emperor, with some variety on the names depending on your culture. The key here is feudalism, that is vassalage. The standard is to pledge fealty to someone of the next higher title, who then pledges fealty to the title above them. This standard is never reached unless you conquer the world and make it be reached. In general, there will be sovereign Dukes, Counts pledged directly to Kings, and Emperors often forgo vassal kings. You have advisers which are assigned from your court,  which is a pool of loyal or disloyal followers whom you can consider for various roles, and to accomplish various tasks. These advisers assist you in running the operations of your feifdom, and allow religious, educational, espionage, stewardship, and martial decisions. Each character has an RPG style stat for each of these, and these along with a portion of your wife's stats and your advisers stats creates the stats used in game for you.Key decisions in this game are marriage, and war. Marriage is the influence you have over your dynasty, and you can get good traits, titles, claims on titles, or political alliances in exchange for the matrimony. Wars allow you to cement alliances and shape the geopolitical landscape. There is much more to the game, as it has surprising complexity, but this is not to be a guide.The game is visually very appealing, despite largely being a giant map. The music is nice, and even after several hours you may not be bored. There is also a ton of DLC for this, for better or worse. These are largely all expansive on the game, and most will be on for most games. Some like the Sunset Invasion are cheesy alternative history which you likely will not want on at all times. There are an absurd number of starting rulers at any of a number of initial scenarios, and a bit of imagination makes all interactions fun as you write your own story of world history amongst the players who have interesting personalities derived from their traits.

												This game is realy good. And, if you want, you can makes stories out of it. Like my 200 year gameplay as house Breizh (Kingdom of Brittany) A nice story, but i cant remember it good enough to tell it :(But you can make better stories, or create big country... or a little one. You can start big, you can start small. Maybe you are a vassal? or maybe you want to play in Westheros (GoT mod)? You can do it in this game. Just buy it... but be carefull.This game have one problem (besides occasional bugs) many DLC´s. You want to play as pagan? DLC! You want to play as a horde? DLC! You want to start game in earlier? DLC! You want to play as muslim? DLC! Republic? India? DLC!But not only big ones, i can understand those big ones. But things like, make african... their color (hope it sounds ok), or indians, arabs, franks, germans, norse, finns, russians, and so on and so on. Or MANY other things, as a DLC. But if you can buy it, or live without it, you gonna have a GOOD time.			"

												This is essentially Game Of Thrones: the game.In my first game, I played as an Irish ruler, and got him married to an English lady to cement an alliance, allowing me to begin a conquest of Ireland. My wife proceeded to bear me daughter after daughter, which due to the country's male inheritance laws left my vassals unhappy.Then, her father dies and she is left as his heir - she returns to her home county in England. Whilst there she bears two more daughters (seven in total now!), which seemed a bit off with me as how can she have my children when in another country?It emerges that she was sleeping with a local Bishop. I realise I need a new wife if I'm to ever have a male heir, yet I can't divorce her or I'll end up making enemies of the English. So, I start a plot to assassinate her.The very first person who offers their help with killing her? The bishop she was sleeping with! And he'll be most valuable, having lots of ""access"" to her! My plot is in motion!And then, said Bishop gets royally drunk and blabs about the entire thing to everyone, my wife is ♥♥♥♥♥♥, everyone thinks I'm scum, and I have a troop of daughters at my ankles.Damn fun game, the emergent gameplay is outstanding.

												As I'm coming closer to the 300 hour mark I think it's my obligation to honor this game with a short review.Crusader Kings 2 is one of those games that just provide you with everything you personally ever wanted in a strategy game, though you never knew that you wanted that before you tried it out. How could I have known my weakness for arresting and torturing christian priests wandering the plains of Russia?Sure, getting started can be rough and frustrating, as the tutorial barely scratches the surface of the ocean of possibilities that is CK2. And even now, after burning more than an entire week of my precious life time with this game I still learn new mechanics and features every time.But once you understand the main aspects it's pretty easy getting completely absorbed in this medieval reality show where you are both director and protagonist.And after I fought the emperor in an open revolt, trapped him in the Alpes where his great army died of starvation, and then duelled him in personal combat on the highest mountain surrounded by thousands of frozen corpses, stroke him down with my Damascus Steel sword, spilled his blood on the snowy plains, and then took the emperor's crown from his dead, cold hands, while ... simultaneously seducing his wife - I knew I would love this game. If you also want to spend your nights creating your own historical BBC documentary I'm the last person to stop you.All you need is a strong imagination to fill the ugly text boxes with life and perhaps a full wallet if you intend to participate in their crazy DLC policy. Which I would only adivice you to do if you already know that you're addicted anyway.			"

												While truly there are lots of things to enjoy about CK2, and everyone finds his own most favourite part in this game, I personally find the stories it creates the most exciting part about it. For example, this story happened just yesterday.One day my character was chilling in a carriage in his old family lands in Hungary when suddenly he was ambushed and taken prisoner by some weirdo in Brittany. The freak tortured my character with rats. What is worse, I had no money to buy my way out of the prison. At the same time, my lovely new wife became pregnant, and, for obvious reasons, this could not be my character's child. After the first daughter came the second and only then my unwitty spymaster uncovered that the weird guy and my unfaithful wife had an affair! Sadly, due to my liege's incompetency in managing the realm, my lands were constantly pillaged by vicious pagan tribes, leaving me with almost no income. Moreover, the regent that was installed to rule in my character's place was a nice and a charitable guy. He shared all of my petty income with the starving and underprivileged. He did not like my character either and never agreed to anything I have asked him to do. My poor character ended up in a dark and cold oubliette after his friend tried to rescue him and failed. He soon passed away, betrayed by everyone. He only needed 20 more gold coins to buy his way out...Soon after the news reached Hungary, king's brother was selected as the new king. Being an envious, lustful and ambitious fellow, he always found his brother's wife to be prettier and more attractive than his own. He immediately divorced and married the unfaithful widow. A few months later, the new king decided to relieve his stress by embarking on a carriage trip to his old family's lands, when suddenly they were stopped on a road by a group of french-speaking hoodlums...

												Love the game, VERY FUN. One of my favorites.Literally over 100 dollars of DLC. Around 40 of which in my opinion, is essential to fully experience the game. About half the world is left unplayable due to the inability to play as Muslim and Pagan characters. I'd be completely alright with this if they weren't in the game to begin with, but it's not. It doesn't feel like an expansion pack, it feels like unlocking bits of the game.I'm honestly surprised EA didn't make it. I'd be completely convinced if it was broken and buggy.

												If you are buying this game, remember that you are not buying a complete product. You are buying a platform for DLCs which are the vast majority of the game. Paradox restricts you very tightly as to whom you can play, and when you can play, and what you can do if you do not buy hundreds of dollars of DLC. I personally think Paradox's DLC model on this is very unethical and would not reccomend this game to anybody who wanted a full game for a reasonable price. You can only play as western christian rulers from a relatively narrow timespan if you do not have dlc. Paradox seems to have gotten better with this, as EUIV has a DLC model that allows a full gameplay experience without DLC, but the DLC enhance it, but this is just a demo to make you want to buy dlc.

When he died, I buried him in the garden, his ""favorite place to play."" Actually teared up. In honor of him, I formed the Empire of Francia and proceeded to destroy the entire military of the Holy Roman Empire, then fight five civil wars and multiple wars in Spain. Marrying into all of the top nations, and allying myself with all of them. Except for the Holy Roman Empire, of course. I murdered all of them.

												This game down to it's core is politics at its basest form. ♥♥♥ kissing the powerful and the many while plotting to become the powerful. It's also  a very archaic form of politics since current politics only ♥♥♥ kisses the powerful.This game is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to get used to, I personally had a lot trouble getting into it. But give it enough time and you'll find it quite simple and even 150+ hours in I'm still learning a few extra tricks to give me more advantages. Another thing you might find daunting is all the DLC and there is a LOT of DLC, it will give you a lot more hours and I mean a LOT more hours of gametime as you play the different types of religions/governments.It also remains quite true to how large kingdoms and empires were run. The bigger they got the weaker the ruler at the top got, since you have to appease all your vassals and pray they start a revolt that you can put down.If you're not sure if you want to play this game there is a demo available, so you don't have to take a gamble with this game.Now I shall get back to kissing the asses of all my vassals!

												This game basically runs like a diplomacy simulator, enabling the player to build their own dynasty the way they want it to be. With an array of different options at your disposal, and a citizenry to keep happy, Crusader Kings can present a challenge. Using Historical time periods and even historical heads of state, The appeal of Crusader Kings 2 moves beyond lovers of Diplomacy games. Dealing with Heir's, Vassals, and underhanded siblings, Crusader Kings allows you to micromanage your dynasty, enabling a player to give their line a personal touch. I don't typically go for these types of games, but in fairness, it is fairly well done and offers a lot of playability options so I have to recommend it if that is the kind of game you enjoy.			"

												(I'm french, so sorry for my mistakes)This game is one of my favorite game ever so far. I got it a year ago and I'm never bored of this game. With each DLC that came out, the game became sometime harder, sometime easier, but I am not complaining about it. Each extensions gave something new to this already awesome game. However, some of those DLC shouldn't exist because they are quite basic, like the Old Gods or Sword of Islam. This game is always a suprise because there will always be something strange that happens, like a jihad for Denmark, or a crusade on France. If you like ahistorical game, this one is for you. Oh, and did I mention that you can lay in multiplayer? The multiplayer part of the game is awesome, even if the servers are unstable. You can so so much stuff stupid with your friends! For example, nearly half of my play time on this gamer is on multiplayer with only one friend!And for those who seek a challenge, try to do the achievements of the game, some are quite hard and will ask you a lot of time of practice! (Kingdom of David for example)As a conclusion, I do recommend this awesome game and if you ever buy it and like it, try the multiplayer with 5 or 6 friends, you'll never the world the same way, especially if you have the conclave DLC.PS. Again, I'm  sorry for my mistakes. "

												I used to ship this game and with over 800 hours (I have a lot of offline time, trust me) I believe I can say that I’ve played through the majority of what this game has to offer. I won’t even lie, I have enjoyed this game immensely throughout most of my hours played and I think it is a good game everyone should experience at some point during a sale. However, that all changed when the updates attacked.*proceeds to stare at the DLC using peripherals* He whispers solemnly, “I’ll be seeing you in a minute”. I have played this game for the better part of two years and I have to say that I absolutely hate the direction of the updates placed upon this game. Even though you can opt for old versions of the game in beta, I feel as though the game has moved backwards at times. 	My most recent issue with the game stems from some bull crap I got during a war I started with Norway in Scandinavia. I attack and completely decimated their army, I also managed to take their capital and 80% of their fiefs (got like 1/100 percent for it). Even so, the war percent dropped form 80% to 30% in a second for no reason, I wasn’t even attacked. Long story short, other countries attacked me after like 30 years of holding all their counties and I lost. The game has some serious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to work out and I’m tired of sitting in a game for hours on end strategizing for it to all crumble away due to unexplainable ♥♥♥♥ery. I’ve seen a lot of crap in my days playing this game (Believe it) but boy does this ♥♥♥♥ takes the cake. Nothing close has ever happened to me like this before the recent updates (At least not at this scale). I even summoned 7500 troops using my massive prestige and I was still defeated out of some form of broken attrition.	Now for my biggest gripe about the game *Walks over to DLC and whispers in its ear* “Its’ time”. Holy crap this game has more DLC then fricking Total war games. I bought the vanilla version of this game on sale for what I though was a reasonable price. However, shortly after I bought it, they released a “complete” edition of the game which I thought was all of the DLC. WRONG! I’ve never been angrier about making a video game purchase in my entire life. I would rather rebuy No Mans Sky than rebuy the entire game I had with DLC for another 40$ (which was cheaper than just buying all of the DLC). You would think they would at least give all of the DLC to me (you know... since it’s “complete”). Seriously this game makes EA look generous. I appreciate buying DLC if it adds flavorful content and improves on the game, I’m all for it! But when your game pushes out tons of DLC and about 50% of it is complete garbage, usually priced at 15$, it makes me question my sanity. Ps. Despite all my rage *rock music intensifies* I still recognize that I can raid Rome to the ground, kidnap the pope and sacrifice his corpse to Thor. If it wasent for all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t DLC scamming and crappy update direction that somewhat makes you feel as though you need to buy certain DLC, this game would be perfect. Really tired of being treaed as a wallet by developers I put my faith in. TLDR: Don’t get shafted by this game by buying it with a bundle. I recommend buying it for like 10$ when it goes on sale again for the vanilla game. There are some good DLC like Viking Conquest etc. but make sure you read all the additional DLC reviews before purchasing. Yes I am mad.			"

												Crusader Kings II is a Grand Strategy game based around familiy dynasties, political power mongering and in short - trying to make sure you have the biggest wealthest family in the world. The game spans ~400 years of historical time between 1066 to 1453 and offers historical events and references that you can either choose to follow or create a new alternantive timeline from. Do you start a 'War of the Roses' battle? Does YOUR family takeover the Papal? Building relationships, marriages, alliances and faking claims is the key. If this sounds all very Game of Thrones then you're right - it is. Crusader Kings II is the best GoT game on the market at the moment, and that's all thanks to engine being used.Crusader Kings II is the end result of many years of creating and improving on Paradox's Clausewitz Engine (the engine responsible for Cruaders Kings, Europa Universalis, Hearts of Iron franchises). If you're familiar with those games, you might feel familiar with CK2, but the truth is this game goes beyond what the engine has produced before hand. The Clausewitz Engine is in sense the major selling point behind CK2, so while the graphics aren't anything special (and are little more than 3D Marker Pieces) the true beauty unfolds as you play.I can't think of many greater feelings than the moment you're 50 year plotting to get your Grandson into place of power from his lowly Duke title to Lord pays off. Sending your Master of Whispers into a neighbouring region to spread lies and cause dissent amongst the vassals, while you forge a plot to fabricate claims to the title and ursurp the Lordship. So good.Paradox have managed to support the game well since release in the form of DLC Expansions, which have opened the game world up and expanded the 'fringe' empires to be just as complex as the 'key' European ones. However they've also supported the game with post-release patching and balancing, so they're not ones to sitback and take your money.I'm honestly finding it hard to explain this game, the only advice I can give is; if you've ever wanted to play the Game of Thrones this is the closest you'll ever get. In fact, do yourself the pleasure of visiting: http://citadel.prophpbb.com/forum3.html and checking out the amazing Game of Thrones mod these guys have been making over the last year or so (WARNING: May contain spoilers for TV viewers).

												One of the Best Grand Strategy Games I have ever played. However unless you have the money to get the DLC, the game is only a shell ehen pruchased without any DLC. This game however with the DLC can be amazing at best, but a lot of the time you are gonna need a lot of patience. Overall, the game is great but beware of the DLC and the fact that buying one of these games form Paradox will likley lead to many hours and possible purchases of other Games such as HOI IV and VIC II. A great game for a Grand Starategist!			"

												Starting a new game, I married my King to a 17years old princess. She quickly became pregnant, which was weird considering ""I was away"". Later she gave birth to a child, and claimed he wasn't mine. It was my 79 years old advisor's offspring, who was allowed to keep the child and raise him as his own. I was not allowed to divorce because I had no reason to (!), and the Pope didn't like me very much.10/10, would get cukold again by a 79 years old advisor, and married to a bi***.			"

												I'm going to try and keep this review short and simple but take note this review is hard to make short. To start off this gmae is like no other it is pretty much the most interesting game you will find. I Truely suggest you atleast try the demo. This game is for all gamers no matter whoever tells you its not. I have been playing this game for awhile to know this isnt just one game you forget about! You will make more momments in this game alone or with freinds that you will never think twice about how much money or effort you spent. The developer's are truely great and are always updating the game. There are many DLC's and i do suggest you buy them to get the full experience this game has to offer. The most defining game features in the game are:700 years of gameplay (with dlc)Your own history in the medieval ages with one familyTons upon tons of days of replayability (no two games are alike)Conquering europeI Give this game a 10/10 and its my opinion that any person and/or gamer can get into this and love it to death !If you have any questions about Crusader Kings 2 or just want to enjoy a nice group full of people that love the game PLEASE contact me, freind me, or even join my group we would love to have more people interested in this game !10/10 A must buy			"

($5.00)And that's only the DLCs that actually add new Mechanics to the game. There's another 50+ flaor packs that add skins and music that cost upward of $100 altogether.

												There's some pretty ♥♥♥♥ed up ♥♥♥♥ going on in this game. I recently played as the glorius Sultan of Andalusia. At the young age of 9 I ♥♥♥♥ed my mother and got her pregnant, wasn't my proudest tumble, so I got rid of that child. Later on my disgusting mother slept with the heathenous Pope as a revenge for killing our son. I decided to let the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ live just to have someone to torture on a bad day. My mother on the other hand I caught plotting to kill me so I hanged her. During my reign I lost an eye, an arm, a leg and was severely injured multiple times, but my excellent military knowledge served me well throughout the years. It was a good reign, the Sultan died a natural death at the age of 74. Long live Andalusia!10/10			"

												  (sorry for the length)  A constantly politically shifting and difficult Europe centric world where you can form your medieval kingdom the way you want it, if your many enemies alow it. The game itself is pretty amazing in scale and with the newest update pretty difficult. Your goal shouldn't be to build a sprawling empire, but to get your family to stand the test of time (that's not to say that controlling a centralized depositic empire is a bad thing) and Paradox is still updating the game and adding more expansions onto it, that's not even mentioning the amazing mod's for the game, if you are in to game of thrones or warhammer, post apocolyptic America, more historical accuracy, less historical accuracy, ect.  If you survive through the ages you can also convert the map file to Europe Univerails 4 and play in a new age, which is nice if you like EU4. (It hasn't grown on me)  The game can get pretty ridiculous too, hilarious at times like when your 8 month old daughter is friends with a 41 year old mercenary captain who is never around. Or when the king of Sweden and Finland inexplicably becomes sunni muslim, and is then promptly assasinated by all of his coutiers and vassals for their religous differences. Good times...  You'll need a powerfull rig though if you want to play all the way though, like with all paradox games it slows down over time, and that's a bummer, though there are probobly mods that remove detail from the map and such. The Price is also pretty steep when you look at it, but if you get it on a sale and don't buy the artsy dlc, it's... do-able. It makes sense considering the game needs a good computer to run it on.  If you are buying the game to play with friends, all players will play with the dlc of the host of the game lobby, so only one of you will need the dlc. When I've played multiplayer games I have played with mod's, and experianced a lot of desync's, which essentially end the game, which is upsetting, but that might just be me or the mods (Dragons in game of thrones mod)  Also if you click or press buttons duing the loading screen the game might just crash. It's because of the game engine from what i've been told. 10/10I bought the artsy stuff too, skins and such (but not the E-books) all the crazy, amazing, or just plain ridiculousness of the game is what earns it the description of ""Grand strategy""			"

Control a man and then a dynasty, enjoy intrigue and politics and strategic marriages. Build your empire and shape your world.

												The best way to describe CK2 is with the stories you create. So here's a tale that happened a long time ago in the far away land of the domains of the Wendish Empire. Once upon a time, there was this Emperor of the Slavs, called Grozscon, who was a magnanimous person, a true born leader and a great military strategist. He arose to power in the age of 22, after his father and elder brother died in a battle against rebels.  At the age of 30, he already had conquered most part of the Holy Roman Empire, the Balkans, Scandinavia and most part of Russia. When he completed his 55, he started a great campaign to conquer England. In one of the battles, his youngest son, Dobieslaw, died. But that did not distracted the old emperor and finally the war was won.  As we grow old, our health start to fail us, and this was no different with Grozscon. He was diagnosed with leprosy, the purgatory in earth, so they say. And at the age of 81, the old emperor passed away, leaving 4 sons and 3 daughters.  Hir heir, Boleslaw, also had leprosy and was at the final stage of the disease and died with only 4 months of ruling. The Empire was in the hands of the grandson of the great emperor Grozscon, who was called Mieszko, The Effeminate, Duke of Silesia.   Mieszko was a poor ruler, a cruel and sloth person, which made him very unpopular with his vassals. Therefore, rebellions started to appear in every corner of the Wendish Empire, leading to great civil wars between Mieszko and his uncles. While the empire was in great chaos, the marvelous Empire of the Greeks flourished and grew strong and eventually took many provinces from the Wendish Empire. The Holy Roman Emperor, ever the opportunist, also invaded and at the last the Pope in Rome called for a Crusade against the Wendish Empire.    Mieszko now finds himself deposed, with only a count title in a god forsaken province and watches in despair as the Empire is thorn apart by endless wars and new rumours comes from the east, were a man controls many riders and conquers everything his set his eyes. 10/10 Would play again and kill all the sons except the perfect heir "

My King's son became king and all the bishops hated him and he had like 20 children, so I was confused.Then I found out he was a master seducer and had had children with literally EVERY SINGLE FEMALE (except for his mother) IN MY COURT. He sudenly fell off of a castle after almost every single lord in the kingdom (totally not started by me) plotted his death.Unfortunately, now the rest of the lords had become pagan and Ireland was conquered by a holy war from the final Catholic province.

												As someone with both an interest in history and a 100% non sexually interest in incest, this game easily got my attention at release. Since then many things have happened. More hilarious bugs have come to live and Jews jewing Jews in Judea have come into play as well. The gameplay is, like in all Paradox games, bad. This, however, doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it.

Make an heir.- Everything is going amazingly.- Declare War on the neighbouring province.- Win the war flawlessly.- Give province to my most trusted courtier.- Declare War on the another neighbouring province.- Win the war flawlessly, again.- Give province to my other trusted courtier.- Life is going incredibly well, soon Ireland will be mine!- SUDDENLY, one of my stupid vassals rebels for no reason!- Crush the rebels and go completely mad, imprisoning him and all of his family then executing them all! No mercy for traitors!- Everyone hates me including my wife!- People starting plotting against me left and right!- I get super paranoid and start executing everyone!- My other vassal rebels.- Some random place I've never heard of declares war on me.- My army is totally crushed.- Laugh like a mad man and lose EVERYTHING.- Game over.10/10 would go completely insane and lose everything again.

												Crusader Kings 2 is probably the most reactionary game ever made. Imagine Game of Thrones without the fantasy stuff. This is a game about killing your kin to steal their lands, diplomatically marrying daughters off to sadistic freaks, crushing peasant revolts, and crusading against the Mohammadeans. Whether you chose to play as the Holy Roman Emperor or the count of a single back country province you’ll have plenty of court intrigue to keep you occupied. It is ½ grand strategy game, ½ dynastic RPG, and 100% awesome.With the various DLCs you can play as non Christian religions too. I highly recommend picking up at least the Sword of Islam and Old Gods DLCs so you can play Muslims and Pagans respectively. "

												The best (it's clear that Paradox own the genre, but this is their best one) Grand Strategy game. Whilst fans of strategy games may miss the interactive combat, this game makes up for it by being more interactive in other aspects such as diplomacy. Take your house and make it last throughout the ages! Who doesnt want to conquer the world? It is one of the most complex games I have ever played and the learning curve is extremely steep, yet through playing the game it is easy to overcome (tutorials are provided, but they arent the most in depth). The game has multiple DLC packs (which arent required, but they do make it more fun) and is being updated regularly. Be prepared to become frustrated; I built my custom house (DLC) and it lasted throughout many centuries and when it came to  the 6 Generation, I was emperor of The Byzantine Empire, Britannia, Francia, The Holy Roman empire. The person I played, was infertile, and all other relatives had been killed off or were women (the game is against women, the populace hate you if youre a female ruler), my character died and with it my House. 100 hours I put in, to lose.But remember, losing is fun!9.8/10 losing the .2 for castration being available to only greeks.

												Crusader Kings 2 is real time/paused strategy game developed by Paradox Interactive. Same developer who made other great games like Europa Universalis 4, Victoria 2, Hearts of Iron 3 and Stellaris. This game is based on Middle Ages to start of renaissance, where EU4 starts. Without DLC starts around 1066, but if you have dlc\'s like Old Gods and Charlemagne you can start it on 700\'s.However before saying this game is all about invading other lands like Civ and Total War, no. Because this game is unique. You rule your dynasty and lead it through the age. You have to control your family by marrying other people for example Holy Roman Empire\'s princesses. Then you extend your family and realm. Same time there is world map, where you can invade land, like in every strategy game. But only land available is Europe, North Africa and part of Asia. There are many events in this game. I\'ll explain hordes, rebellions and crusades in this review. There are many hordes. For example Mongols and Abbasids. If you have Sunset Invasion DLC, Aztecs are gonna invade Europe too. Hordes born quickly and rise by invading all neighbor realms. They are hard to defeat but they collapse easily with rebellions. Rebellions are events where claimer of duchy of puppet state declare war on country and try to switch government or get independece. That\'s why you see all rebellions threats on your intrique menu, so you can prepare at threats or plot to kill threats. And last, crusades. If you part of catholic or orthodox religion, pope or archbishop might declare crusade to invade Jerusalem, Anatolia or any lands where real life crusaders were. You don\'t have to join crusade but if you join and get most points you\'ll gain all lands that were invaded in crusade.Family relations are pretty important as your sons that have bad relation with you might try to kill you or start rebellion. And affairs are just gonna anger your wife and your children. However having family member in countries like Holy Roman Empire might help you make alliance with them, so that is useful. On my game, I just spammed my every daughter on big countries, HRE, England, France and Byzantium.Combat works really well, but units are pretty hard to make and army levies might rise too big.Overall this game is great and I had alot more fun with it than with Civ or EU4. I recommend it!			"

												This game might be intimidating and you need a couple minutes/hours to watch various tutorials/lets play in youtube just to get some grasp on how to play the game. Dont launch this expecting a Sid Meier's Civilization type of game or you will be dissappointed.But its worth it once you overcome that. The game is full of intrigue, backstabbing, incest and other things that you will do just to retain/expand your territory and continue your dynasty.And also one more thing. Dont get complacent when everything is going your way as tragedy can strike in just a couple of turns.			"

												Crusader Kings II is an in depth grand strategy game set in 769 at the earliest, and 1066 by default. I have had great fun playing up through the ages, Rebuilding Byzantium and waging holy war on the Muslim caliphs that rise to power below my vast empire, reclaiming land. Defending against the onslaught of the Mongols, then later of Timur in the east, and the false Holy Roman Empire in the West. This game provides deep role play, strategy and fun set in the Middle Ages to the High Middle Ages.			"

												The best (it's clear that Paradox own the genre, but this is their best one) Grand Strategy game. Whilst fans of strategy games may miss the interactive combat, this game makes up for it by being more interactive in other aspects such as diplomacy. Take your house and make it last throughout the ages! Who doesnt want to conquer the world? It is one of the most complex games I have ever played and the learning curve is extremely steep, yet through playing the game it is easy to overcome (tutorials are provided, but they arent the most in depth). The game has multiple DLC packs (which arent required, but they do make it more fun) and is being updated regularly. Be prepared to become frustrated; I built my custom house (DLC) and it lasted throughout many centuries and when it came to  the 6 Generation, I was emperor of The Byzantine Empire, Britannia, Francia, The Holy Roman empire. The person I played, was infertile, and all other relatives had been killed off or were women (the game is against women, the populace hate you if youre a female ruler), my character died and with it my House. 100 hours I put in, to lose.But remember, losing is fun!9.8/10 losing the .2 for castration being available to only greeks.

												Crusader Kings II is the sequel to the by now fairly old Crusader Kings and in true Paradox tradition it improves heavily upon every single aspect of the game. In particular the move to the Clausewitz engine needs a mention because it allows a game like Crusader Kings II to fully achieve it's potential in a way the previous game never could.The game is a dynastic Grand Strategy game. This means that while you still take control of a single country like in other Paradox games are you not just some faceless entity behind the screens, you actually take control of that country's ruler and upon his or her death, take control of the legitimate heir to continue your reign. This makes controlling a country and leading it to greatness a much more personal experience as it's your family that's leading the charge, with the various offshoots that didn't manage to become King constantly plotting how to remove the current favorite.In general much of the game will be spent dealing with your family and their thirst for power. Through a number of laws you can select who is the heir and how he or she is chosen and you can fully expect that anyone who doesn't not currently top that list will be working diligently to remove the one that does. And it's not always the best outcome when your able and strong son suffers an untimely accident and your gluttonous greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who is surprisingly proficient at intrigue becomes the last heir standing.Like in most of Paradox's games warfare takes the front seat and it is the prime method for which to expand your lands, wealth and prestige. However Crusader Kings, through this dynastic system makes great strides towards making peacetime more interesting. The bigger your family, the more vassals you have, the more options will be available to you during peacetime and you will often have to work hard to keep your Kingdom stable. The option for marrying off unwanted sons to powerful widows is also a very effective way to increase your lands as you may one day some generations from now find yourself the heir to whole new territories. Quicker with a little creative assassination.The graphics of the Clausewitz engine are beautiful although that is never really a necessity or a priority of a Grand Strategy game, particularly not a Paradox one, but it is nice to see that there's improvement on this front as well. The music is heavily mood setting and wonderful as always and the many small music DLC's available helps improve the selection tremendously.All in all, Crusader Kings II does not disappoint as it proves itself a great sequel to a great game. Everything is simple better. A true must buy for any fans of Grand Strategy or Dynastic games. And for anyone that simply thinks incest is hilarious.Also, completely irrelevant to the game, I'd strongly recommend that you go watch the ""Seven Deadly Sins"" trailers on youtube that were released as promotional material before the game came out. They are definitely worth a watch whether you want to play the game or not.			"

												Great. Artifical Intelligence may destroy and enslave you. ENSLAAAVEE. It's a good game. You work with a dynasty. Your dynasty. In Europe and Africa. In High and Late Middle Ages. 1066 - 1453, 867 - 1453 with the DLC ""Old Gods"". You rule a country: From a small province to the greatest empire. You have your heirs, inherit laws and everything other, from taxes starting.   There are five levels of authority in the game; the four highest of which are playable at the start:   - Emperor, Kaiser, Basileus, Shahanshah, Khagan (highest ones).    - King, Shah, Despot, Sultan, Serene Doge, King Bishop, Khan, Prince Mayor. The title 'King' is equivalent to the title 'Archduke' if the holder bends the knee to an Emperor or person of equivalent title.    - Duke, Doux, Satrap, Emir, Doge, Grand Prince, High Chief, Prince Archbishop, Grand Mayor, Jarl, Petty King, Caliph.    - The second lowest rank is that of the Count – variations are Earl, Sheikh, Wâli, Marzban, Chief, Lord Mayor, Prince Bishop, Metropolitan (Orthodox).     -The lowest in-game rank of authority is that of the Baron – variations are Timariot, Shaman, Mayor, Bishop, Patrician – of which only Patrician is a playable rank if the player owns the The Republic DLC, as the government of only a single holding with no non-commoner courtiers to command would provide the player with very few or no opportunities for intrigue.    The basic provincial unit of the game is the ""county"". Each county contains a preset number of holdings, with the maximum being seven holdings in a single county, including the comital capital. The holdings can be of three types: castle, city or temple holding. A castle is ruled by a baron, a city is ruled by a Mayor, and a temple is ruled by a bishop (each one having their own cultural and religious variations, such as the Muslim Mosque). Generally, a county has a capital set on a barony, but some counties (most notably in Italy) have city or temples set as the capital (ex: Rome is a temple-capital county and Venice is a city-capital county). As the player incorporates a lay nobleman, it can only exert control adequate over counties with castles as capitals or he'll suffer the ""wrong holding type"" penalty in revenue – thus, city and temple holdings must be given to mayors and bishops. Exceptionally, Muslim rulers can control Mosques, which grant piety points. If the player owns The Republic DLC, the player can also take control of a coastal republic, like Venice, Genoa, The Hansa, Gotland or Cherson. In this case city holdings, instead of baronies, can be held without penalty.Realm LawsThere are two kind of laws in the game: the Tax and Levy laws – which determine the taxes your vassals (feudal, burgher and clergymen vassals) must pay, and also the number of levies they must provide – and the Succession Laws – which can be of two types: gender and inheritance laws. Succession laws are of fundamental gameplay importance, as the game over condition is the player's inability of establishing a dynastic heir. As a rule, succession is patrilineal, which means marriage offsprings will always be from the father's dynasty, but there is the option of matrilineal marriages for female characters, which means the offspring will be from the mother's lineage.   Gender Laws are the following: Agnatic – Only males inheirt Agnatic-Cognatic – Females can inherit, but only if there are no eligible male heirs. Absolute Cognatic – Women inheirt on the same grounds as men do. (this type of succession is only available to Basque culture characters and the rulers with Cathar religion)However, although Paradox added Enatic (males are entirely excluded from succession) and Enatic-Cognatic (females have preference) succession, these are only accessible through modifications to the base game.   Inheritance Laws are: Gavelkind – The most common law, in which the inheritance is divided among all eligible children, the oldest inheriting the primary title. This succession type allows for a 30% larger demesne, the disadvantage is that it fractures the demesne upon succession. Feudal Elective – The heir elected by vassals holding elector titles inherits all titles. This type gives an opinion boost to vassals, but it might have an heir not from the players dynasty—therefore ending the game. Seniority – the oldest dynasty member inherits all titles. The disadvantage is that it usually results in elder characters inheriting, potentially creating a quick succession of short-lived rulerships. Primogeniture – the firstborn child inherits all titles, in depth-first search descent. Arguably the most advantageous inheritance type, but it incurs in a slight prestige penalty for landless progeny. Agnatic Open/Turkish Succession – available to every Muslim character (and also the only type of succession available) – the son that holds most titles inherits all his father's titles. Patrician Elective (With The Republic DLC) – the only succession type for Merchant Republics – the heir is decided upon by a calculation of age, prestige, and a unique campaign fund feature from the 5 patrician families. Only males can inherit. Investiture - only succesion law for bishoprics where the successor can be appointent by the ruler if under Free Investiture or by the Pope if under Papal Investiture. If there is no appointed heir then the game will chose character from the court of the bishop or create a new character if there is no suitable characters in the bishops court. Elective Open – the only succession type for Republics (and also some types of holdings under the player level) – the game will chose a character from the republic rulers court or create a new character if there is no suitable characters in the mayors court. Tanistry – open to Celtic Culture group which, like the Elective system allows vassals to choose the heir but restricts the choice to members of the current holders dynasty. Ultimogeniture – the default succession type for Ilkhanate, the Golden Horde and the barony of Altenburg, in which the youngest child of the ruler inherits all the rulers titles upon their death. Appointment - Used by Holy Orders feudal vassals called Commanders. All feudal titles are granted by the Grandmaster and revert back to him after the holder dies. Papal Succession - Pope's succesion law where elected Cardinal's chose the next Pope among themselves. Only used by the Pope if the player owns the Sons of Abraham DLC. King and Emperor-level characters also have a special set of available laws, the ""Crown Authority Laws"", which simulate the power exerted by the monarch over his vassals. For example, with ""autonomous vassals law"", the monarch cannot revoke vassal's titles, and they only provide levies to their liege if they hold him or her in high regard. In ""absolute crown authority law"", the vassals are entirely forbidden of waging war against each other and foreign enemies and must provide a sizable amount of levies.That's a really really good game for about 1894172381274109487128409 hours of gameplay.

												Crusader Kings 2 is the campaign of Total War, set to focus not on a nation, but on a family.  Your house must become as powerful as possible, this involves a lot of political manipulation and throwing money around.  As I say, the game is the campaign - there is no real control over your battles like in Total War, what you enter the fight with is all that contributes to your victory.  That is a shame, hopefully by the time Paradox decides to do Crusader Kings 3, they'll have worked up the nerve to go for it.While I cannot recommend the game to every type of strategy game fan, this one has been a lot of fun for me, and has presented me with a lot of challenges.

												After a dozen games that ended misrably for my character and his dynasty within only a few years after starting the game, I have finally started a game that lasted for more then twenty minutes.I started out as Leon, and all was well. Nothing happened, all my vassals were cool with me. Then I realized my kin in Aragon started to invade the moslems below us. Not wanting to be overpowered by Aragon a century later, I proceeded to take a small coastal province. I then promptly forgot what I was doing and spammed summer fairs and feasts for a decade or two.When my first character died(Alfonso), he had quite the sum of prestige(around 500 or so). And, with the game engine doin' its thing, Alfonso's succesor(his son Alfonso) got around 200 prestige. Following his dear father's footsteps, Alfonso Jr. spammed the ever-loving crap out of feasts and festivals. But, not more then five years into his reign the pope rang him and asked him to join in a crusade against the moslems. Coincedentially, the targets for Christiandom's righteous wrath happened to be the nation directly below me.So, of course, Deus Vult and all that. I invaded two small provinces in the first part of the crusade. After conquering these two places, I sat on my bum and waited the crusade out, jealously guarding my newly acquired lands.Then, suddenly, as though the Heavenly Father himself thanked me for my participation in the crusade, I acquired half of Spain.Not really sure how.But, Now my prestige started to sky rocket. First, it was 300. Then it was 400. Then, 500. 600. 700. And on, and on and on it went until I had nearly 900 prestige by the time I was thirteen. Que another decade or so of me stealing tiny chunks of realms from the muslims that remained in Spain. Not only was I the terror of the muslims, I had backed the nation of Aragon into a corner, with only two land-locked provinces and a handful of coastal lands.I then married the Queen of France.And, by the time I reached my mid twenties, I was the stuff of legend. Having already held my Grand Tournament and accumulated nearly 2000 prestige, I was on top of the world. Loving wife how owns the entirety of France, promising sons, total alegience of all my vassals.Then I became a homosexual.Nothing wrong with that, not even my vassals batted an eye at it.But they started to get worried when I went insane. Barking at people, wearing shoes as hats, the usual crazyness.I also happened to be fighting a war with Britain in defense of France at the time, all while manipulating the law to make my son's kingship more secure.Then I ♥♥♥♥ed up. I failed to see that choosing Senoirity as my inheritance guideline, I completely removed all of my children from the line of inheritence. Instead, It was my cousin.But, you know what they say, practice makes perfect.TL;DRBecame one of the most legendary kings by the age of thirteen, married the queen of France, went insane screwed over my family. This game is a must buy.			"

												TL;DR: 9.9/10 (nearly perfect). Pros: too many to quickly list, see paragraph below.Cons: steep learning curve, and potential expense of the full (& extremely important) game in the form of tons of DLC.CK2 has quickly become one of my favourite games of all time. This game is such a fun mix of history/alternate history, intrigue, state/empire building, and ruler simulator. The possibilities available (with all the DLC) are so numerous that during the 400+ hours I’ve played I’ve barely scratched the surface. Wonder what would happen if the Vikings had conquered, held, and integrated Italy into the Swedish or Norwegian kingdoms? DO IT. Getting tired of the Catholics attacking you when you play as the Umayyads (muslim rulers of the Iberian peninsula)? Holy war all the Catholic countries, take their territory and convert their populations to Islam; Rome the center of Catholicism? Not any more! take it from the Infidels and make it Sunni (or Shi'a), or if you're not muslim then convert it to Norse or any of the multitude of diverse and historically accurate religions .  The possibilities for epic, ""world"" conquering and non-historically accurate shenanigans are nearly infinite.  Let your inner history nerd free, and mess with the world in a fun, engaging, and often very personal way. Another important aspect of this game besides the world conquering/state building is the character aspect.  Instead of just playing a country you are actually an individual (a count, duke, king, or emperor).  Individuals have traits which affect (positively or negatively) their stats which in turn affect the functionality of your state.  There are thousands of unique events for your character to “interact” with, adding an aspect of role playing that is not merely a side thing but a full fledged and fleshed out mechanic.  All the possibilities and outcomes an individual character can experience keeps the game from being just another conquer the enemies territory and “take over the world” (brain) game and elevates it into a unique class of it’s own. There are only two negatives to this game, both of which ultimately don’t affect it's enjoyability. First problem is the price of the game and all it’s DLC. To get the best (and “real”) CK2 experience you really do need all the DLC and when it’s not on sale this game can cost $150+. Lucky the game goes on sale frequently and I’ve been able to (over some time) acquire all the DLC for much, MUCH less than $150. I don’t know exactly how much but it’s probably only like $40/50. Buying the ""complete package"" at the start when on sale costs $40 and is definitly a perfect deal.  Le'ts just say that despite not paying $150+ for the game I've definitly gotten WAY more than $150 worth of fun from it. I'm glad I didn't pay that much but now that I know how good the game is and if I had to go back & pay the full price I wouldn't hesitate.  The second problem is the learning curve. Being a grand strategy game there is a MASSIVE amount of stuff to learn.  I’m not the sharpest tool in the shed so it took me a good 50+ hours before I was confident enough to say I fully knew how to play.  The 50ish hours I spent learning were fun but I didn’t realize how amazing this game is until I actually got fluent in the game (around 100+ hours in).  Now though that i’ve “mastered” how the game is played I struggle to name a game I’ve enjoyed playing more (ok I know: The Binding of Isaac/Rebirth).  One way to help speed up learning the ins & outs is to watch tutorial/let’s play videos. There is a youtuber named Arumba who is not only extremely entertaining but is also a CK2 master.  Watching his CK2 content really helped accelerate my enjoyment and understanding of the game. I fully recommend watching some tutorial/let’s play videos while/before playing the game, it’ll help alleviate some of the frustration/insurmountability and intimidation the first time you boot CK2 up.  I can’t recommend this game strongly enough, it is gigatons of fun.

												You know you’ve been playing too much Crusader Kings II when you start arranging betrothals between your and your friend’s children and spend the rest of your time musing on heraldry. Crusader Kings II is an ambitious strategy masterpiece full of intrigue, diplomacy, and war. The player controls a single noble dynasty through the European middle ages in a world as changeable as it is engaging.One word I would definitely not use to describe Crusader Kings II is ‘accessible’. When I first started the game, I had to sort through dozens of menu screens and tabs trying to figure out to do. I can’t be sure, but at one point I think I accidentally attempted to abdicate the Duchy of Kent in favor of my Norwegian half-brother. There certainly were helpful messages and tips in great abundance, but if I really wanted to spend an hour reading, I would be downloading O. Henry short stories, not starting up a new game.Once you do get the hang of the controls, though, Crusader Kings II opens up to almost endless possibilities. You can expand your dynasty by clever power play, strategic marriages, or through military force alone. If you work hard as an impoverished count, your grandchildren could be kings and queens. In a game revolving around diplomacy, however, the AI can be a little off-putting in its lack of complexity. While computer players are reasonably clever, they always make the most rational choice, which makes you feel a bit out of place as you attempt to coerce an Arabian sheikh to help you to invade Sweden.The graphics are nothing to write home about, unless you wanted to let your folks know that games can be released in 2012 and still run on any computer more advanced than an abacus. The Crusader Kings II interface is basically a detailed map surrounded by different menus. If you weren’t wearing your glasses, it would look a lot like Total War, only you can’t zoom in for battles- all physical conflict is resolved off-screen as you watch the number of troops still alive decrease. The constant music definitely helps to distract from the less-than-interesting graphics. The same tracks are played over and over, but they’re epic enough to make it worth it.The beautiful thing about Crusader Kings II is the way it generates stories through emergent gameplay. Take King Tudwal the Great, who loved gardening but would occasionally fly off the handle and kill his own family members, or Count Oberto, who despairingly turned to a scholarly life after failing to find a bride for his homosexual nephew. These aren’t characters you find in most Triple-A games.If you only want to relax for a few minutes, you would probably be best served playing Plants vs Zombies, but if you want to spend a challenging 400 years taking over medieval Europe through vilest treachery, Crusader Kings II is without rival. Now if you’ll excuse me, my uncle just raised the banners of Scotland in rebellion against his Welsh overlords.			"

The English King then married her, knowing that she was the heir to Scotland. The day after his wife inherited the kingdom, the king assassinated her. As her husband, the king inherited Scotland.""

												I always review the games I buy, and I usually do it after having owned and played them for around a week. CK2 is different, and in order to review such a game I had to play it more. And more, and more, and more, until finally, I believe that I have played this game enough to say that this is the best game that has ever been made! A game with both such depth and width has never been made before in my opinion.Here you can murder your son simply because you want to marry his wife, or you can seduce your sister if you want to go a little bit game of thrones. Speaking of game of thrones, if you get your hands on someone you don't like, you can torture, mutilate or murder anyone! In times of need you can even become a cannibal. Want to discreetly get rid of an annoying uncle? Put him in the vanguard of your armies, or fabricate false stories allowing you to imprison him without opinion-penalties from your subjects. But who cares about their subjects? Just imprison him and execute him publicly without reason, beacause you are the lord!I approve this message.			"

												The armored Cataphract regiments from the Komnenian household guard led my Anatolian armies in the east while a smaller force of Varangians led a simultaneous invasion of muslim-held Sicily in the west. Infidel armies were crushed underfoot, provinces fell one by one, and the petty emir's begged for peace as the Byzantine Restoration swept to all shores of the Mediterranean. ""Good!,"" I said, ""this was getting too easy!"" when the Sunni's finally declared a jihad. My forces took the initiative and several large mercenary companies and 20,000 Byzantines landed near the Nile before the first infidel armies even reached my borders. Small muslim armies were swatted away as they attempted to repel my invasion, but they were no match for my men as we ravaged the Egyptian delta. The Shiites declared their own jihad against the recently ""liberated"" sicilian holdings a few months after we landed in Egypt. ""Whatever,"" I chuckled, ""the mighty sons of Rome do not fear a these desert men!"" I recruited more mercenaries and landed in Sicily just as the first Shiite armies began to trickle in by boat. Each month brought a fresh wave of infidels and we crushed each attack and pressed on with the sieges.But months turned in to years, and the trickle of muslim armies became a steady stream of larger and larger enemy armies. My fleets began to frantically criss-cross the Mediterranean, ferrying whatever regiments I could spare from theatre to theatre to counter each wave. My men were winning every battle, but we were losing soldiers faster than they could be replaced. I watched in disbelief as my army and Varangian core in Sicily was overrun, trapped, and annihilated, and the Shiites crossed the strait to capture my holdings in Italy. Then my armies holding eastern Anatolia were forced to pull back to a defensive line near the Bosphorus as large muslim hosts pressed towards my capital. My Egyptian invasion force had been significantly weakened by endless waves of Sunni's, and the desert sun was killing even more. I evacuated Egypt and pulled back the remaining armies to regroup in Greece.My war chest was also running out, which forced me to disband the remaining mercenary companies to keep them from rebelling, and scrapped large portions of my fleet. My disbelief turned to horror as the Shiites landed in Greece and the Sunni's crossed the Bosporus and laid siege to Constantinople. I gathered what remained of my fragmented forces, nearly 20k men, around Athens and won a close battle over a large Shiite force that had crossed into western Greece, and finally convinced the desert men to agree to peace in exchange for the Sicilian duchy I had won years earlier. My men then charged north, defeating a small muslim host that surrounded Constantinople and relieving the city for a few months. But another Sunni host of some 50k crossed the strait soon after, forcing my army to retreat and threatening to destroy my last hopes for the Restoration. The situation had gone from dire to impossible.And that is when they appeared- A force of 50k imperials arrived on a fleet outside my capital, led by the Kaiser himself. A few years into the war, I had arranged for my son to marry the daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor in the west, and although he had officially joined the war in my defense, up to this point, I had only seen a few small inneffective armies in Italy. I marched the last sons of Rome north-east, and joined battle just as the Kaiser landed at the head of his great army. Together we overpowered and crushed the muslim forces, and the Kaiser's fleet prevented a muslim escape into Anatolia. The infidels were completely destroyed. Soon after, the Sunni's finally agreed to a white peace that left my Eastern empire intact. I never forgot that the true sons of Rome had been saved by the pretenders in the west, and our alliance lasted for generations until the new Roman Empire and the title of Augustus was finally restored.For those of you wondering, this did actually happen during my play through way back in 2013 and it was the reason I became hooked on CKII until I eventually graduated to Europa Universalis 4. This game is unique in the strategy genre and I would recommend it to people that enjoy the Total War series, but always wanted more depth in the character aspect of the game (e.g. Kings, Princes, and Generals). If you are on the fence about this game, then check out a few of the Game of Thrones mod videos on youtube- I never played the mod, but watching the LP's sold me. Enjoy!			"

												Just... if you have a life, stay away from this game.Imagine taking the Sims. Now, make every character in the Sims religious and despising every one else that's not their religion. Then make them ten times more evil. Now, give them an inordinate amount of power and make them kings of lands stretching from Iceland to Bengal. Add a sprinkle of chaos and human interference, and you have Crusader Kings II.You control a king or doge and guide his actions and rulership. Be a tyrant, be a ruler of a docile disposition. Just keep a hold of your vassals, win the elections, and make sure to kill that kid that has a claim on your title.Often events pop up that give you options. However, the effects of your decision are neatly laid out for you, meaning there is little sense of randomness of what happens. You pick the thing with the best effect. The events are sometimes repetitive, and you always usually end up choosing one option throughout all your playthroughs.Although there are characters with traits and personalities, you as a player will, unless you diliberately keep your character's traits in mind, play to your own wants and needs of the game, not what the character you are controlling will want. The game's overall very fun, but lacking in documentation, and for a Strategy/RPG, does little to encourage the RPG side of things. The game's tone is usually serious and historical, but occasionally tongue-in-cheek. (especially if you get the lunatic trait) Sometimes, especially with DLC, the game can become fantasy or simply ridiculous (e.g., in Sunset Invasion the New World, more specifically the Aztecs, can colonize the old world, instead of the other way around. In The Sons of Abraham you can father or mother the spawn of Satan unknowingly. Unknowingly, that is, until he kills your entire family, leaving him as the only heir, then killing you and taking your throne.)In some ways this game is ""How to be an evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 101"". It has a freaking ""evil plan"" mechanic for crying out loud! In others it's also ""How to be a Radical 101"". Christians can go on Crusades, Muslims on Jihads and everyone else on Genericly named ""Great Holy Wars"".This game is also great if you like Game of Thrones. Murder? Check! Incest? Check! Anyone can die, no matter how important? Double-check.I'd recommend this game to the following people:Evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥sReligious RadicalsStrategy FansParadox Interactive FansGame-of-Thrones FansPoliticians			"

												This is a great medieval simulator. The combat aspects are extremely downplayed leaving you to focus on your court polotics and intrugue. You play as a medieval lord ranging from count to duke to king. You journey through time making plays for power within your kingdom you will advance through lines of succesion to the next generation. Go on crusades to claim the holy land from infedels, and wage holy war against the pagan heathens, all the while staving off rebellion and rogue lords attempting to usurp your domain. This game features rts sandbox and rpg aspects and it well worth the  sale price of $10 for the vanilla client. IMO the republic dlc, the old gods dlc, and legacy of rome are the most worthwhile and neccesary dlc. The rest mostly just come down to personal preferance and what you think you will play.You can find plenty of mods on the paradox forum including a game of thrones westeros mod (the whole time i was playing vanilla i was wishing there was a game like that and when i found it on the forums i was ecstatic). The middle earth mod and tamriel mods are in development as of yet.If you are unsure about buying this game give the demo a try or maybe check out some lets play videos on u tube. Overall this game is wonderful and deserves your attention if not only briefly to experience the greatness that is ck2.			"

Crusader Kings II is a medieval politics grand strategy game. Maneuver nobility relations as you seek to expand the power and prestige of your dynasty, generations after generations.Pros: Where to begin? There are countless characters (thousands): barons, counts, dukes, kings, courtiers, family members and everything in between for every city, barony, county, tribe, sheikdom or other political region denominator. Relationship behaviors are based off a multitude of character and personality traits. You manage a character, and upon death his heir, then his heir, through centuries of history as kingdoms and empires rise and fall, acquiring lordship over titles through conquering armies, political weddings, intrigue and backstabbing. The base game is set specifically for Europeans during the crusades, while expansions add Northern Africa, Middle East, Scandinavia, Western Asia and India, with each distinct culture and religion having its own tribal, feudal and monarchic mechanics. Many random events allow you to determine what type of person your current character becomes, engrossing you in the story of each of them, influencing and determining the fate of any trivial or world changing event. The game is regularly and constantly being updated: I'm not only referring to the multitude of DLCs that add historically accurate ethical portraits and cultural armory, but actual core mechanics are regularly revised, enhanced and added to by the developers. The game is fully open-ended, and leaves you to determine your political goal. Do you wish to rebuild the Roman Empire? Unite Great Britain? Overcome enemies in a world-wide crusade? Overthrow the Pope? Found Ukraine? Survive the Mongol onslaught? Endless possibilities!Cons: The game has a high learning curve, and new comers must be willing to put in hours of learning, trial and error, and tutorial reading to understand how every mechanic works. Graphics are passable, barely enough to serve the game's purpose. Even at easier levels, difficulty remains high and players must be willing to go through constant frustrations as you are limited to decisions your character makes as a single person, which means there is no direct control over the outcome of battles, plots and events. The game can be slow at times, sometimes requiring months, years, decades and even generations of in-game time to bring any plan to fruition.Verdict: ★★★★★ - Play this. Now.This game isn't meant for everyone. It requires a lot of patience and dedication. But the game can also be immensely rewarding when you successfully achieve your goals. This game left me retelling the tales of how, as a count, I married my firstborn son to a duchess so that my grandson would inherit the king's throne (and expected to play that character two generations later), just to have my second son get branded as a kinslayer for killing his eldest brother, becoming my new heir and throw my entire plan to smithereens! The game is addictive, so if you have the patience to play through Cruisader Kings II's demo tutorial, you just have to get the entire game!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												After 1800+ hours playing Crusader Kings II, the most recent DLC and free content expansion, Conclave, has forced me to withdraw my formerly enthusiastic approval.  CKII used to be one of the premiere Grand Strategy titles available.  Sadly, over the course of several expansion/DLC releases the game has lost its way, becoming increasingly tedious and straying far from the original wonderful gameplay.  The Conclave DLC and the accompanying free content patch was released completely unbalanced and apparently largely untested.  It caused a widespread negative reaction which forced Paradox to immediately begin work on a fix patch.  That patch, now in open beta testing, goes a long way toward fixing the worst of the problems.  Unfortunately, it doesn't go far enough.  The root of the problem is that the entire concept of Conclave makes councils far too powerful.  The intent of Paradox seems to be to make the game more difficult and thus hinder the ability of players to ""paint"" the map all in the color of their empire.  The intended result was achieved.  And now the game is a mess of micromanaging council votes and council favor which detracts from the initial design concept of a fun game focused on dynasties and war in the medieval period.  Paradox might as well change the name of the game to Crusader Kings II: The Council -Hindered, Blocked and Trolled.  The game is no longer focused on dynasty and conquest and religious fervor in the medieval milieu.  Now it is just a grumpy, greedy pseudo-democracy council simulator set in a medieval era with the player forced into spending inordinate amounts of time dealing with fractious, constant council problems almost to the exclusion of everything that once made this a great game.   Congratulations, Paradox.  The greed pushing a need to continually release more DLC to line corporate pockets has finally sent the core game into oblivion. You succeeded in satisfying a vocal minority who wanted the game to be more difficult (with no proof that many of those who complained had even played the game beyond the Easy setting).  In return, you've so drastically altered the basic gameplay that Crusader Kings II is no longer really about Crusader Kings.  You've turned a fine Grand Strategy game set in the medieval period into something entirely different. Short of removing the Conclave DLC and the free content expansion entirely, there is no fix for this.  The game has moved too far from its original design concept, which attracted many of us to the game in the first place.  There are other better democracy simulators available.  They aren't Grand Strategy games; but neither is Crusader Kings II since the changes of the last expansion.			"

												The CKII Experience:1. Create an awesome looking character with so-so traits.2. Marry a  princess from some far-flung kingdom.3. Sire some children (and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s)4. Use your so-so council to spread your influence over nearby lands.5. Fabricate some claims, infuriate some nobles, and rise from a count to a duke.6. Your character becomes depressed, stressed, and possesed.7. You die in a Viking raid from some distant pagan chiefdom.8. Your heir, despite your efforts, becomes a tyrant.9. His councilors contstantly join plots to kill him and eventually his siblings rise up and, with the help of the freaking Holy Roman Empire, revoke your titles, imprison and execute you.			"

												500 hours. Five. Hundred. Hours.Since I purcahased Crusadser Kings II for $23.99 on July 17, 2012, roughly %3.5 of my life has been devoted solely to this game.And I'm still playing.Why? Because it's a masterpiece. I can comfortably say this is the overall best game I have ever played. Maybe I'm a history nerd, maybe I like maps, maybe I enjoy imprisioning and killing all my relatives so that little genius baby boy can have a shot at becoming the first Breton to rule all of Western Europe. Could be there's something cathartic about converting to Cathar just so you can launch a holy war against the Pope who gave you all your power with that invasion CB against the HRE in the first place. Maybe it's the strategy, so deep that I still find myself looking to the wiki to find the most efficient way to conquer. I might get a little too into the roleplaying, would my kind, charitable, humble, Catholic duke really execute his own son just because he's a drunken imbecile? I know I'm not entirely sure what keeps bringing me back, but I do know that the sheer replayability of this game is staggering. If you're thinking about buying this game, seriously consider whether you have any real work you'd like to get done in the next two years, because more than likely you're going to be plotting against your liege rather than plotting out your next project at the office, or whatever...

												Just downloaded the vanilla game last night along with ""A Game of Thrones"" mod from moddb.com.  First playthrough has gone something like this...- Started the game as Rhaegar Targaryen during Robert's Rebellion.- Kidnapped Ned Stark's sister, Lyanna, and hid her in the Tower of Joy near Dorne. - Spent twenty minutes figuring out how to sail off of Dragonstone Castle.- Found Robert at the Trident and rewrote GOT history by crushing his army to a pulp and throwing Robert in chains.- Became King when dad was assassinated in King's Landing by Janos Slynt.- Sent Janos Slynt to The Wall for his troubles.- Sent all remaining advisors in King's Landing to The Wall for good measure.- Laid siege to Storm's End Castle and burned the Stormlands to the ground.- Went to the Tower of Joy and knocked up Lyana Stark.- Robert was furious and demanded Trial by Combat.  I appointed Ser Arthur Dayne, Sword of Morning as my champion.  - Robert is diced to pieces.  Dayne maybe breaks a sweat and spends days washing blood out of his white cloak.- I went back to the Tower of Joy and knocked up Lyanna once more for good measure.- Rebellion ends and everybody falls in line for a few months.  - My ♥♥♥♥ of a little brother, Viserys, somehow gains thousands of supporters and attempts to usurp the throne. - I uncovered his plot and had him thrown in the Black Cells.- He is 11 years old so the Night's Watch won't take him.  I have him executed instead.- The High Septon hated that and declares a holy war against me.  Nearly all the lords in the Seven Kingdoms join in.- None of my vassals answer my calls for aid.  - I almost surrender when I realize the leader of the rebellion is the High Septon and located with me in King's Landing.- I quickly raised a levy and stormed Baelor's Sept.- The High Septon is dragged out, imprisioned and sent to The Wall.- The Second Rebellion ended the next day.- I made all the factions that were mad at me inter-marry.  - With about 200 weddings going on, nobody knows who to fight anymore so I've bought myself some time.- Currently, I am searching for dragon eggs in Essos.23/10, Would kidnap Lyanna and send everyone else to The Wall again.Thank you Paradox and CK2: AGOT Dev Team!

												A complex game to get into, however a fantastic piece of strategy gameplay focusing on the people that run the areas, and the political intrigue and interactions. Where political machinations and plots are more important than raw military might.The DLC expansions are also excellent adding even more events and ways to play. I've personally played as the Irish, and the Norse ancestry Scots in the Old Gods expansion, and the game changes considerably between the cultures, which is interesting. And of course there is the Game of Thrones mod, which is just icing on the cake.			"

												This is my most played game. What can I say?  I just killed 2 of my grandson's and my son, so that my second eldest son would inherit the thrones of Absynnia and Nubia.  My selected heir has taken the throne and I've decided to try and declare a holy war against my Sunni neighbors to the north who are involved in a huge civil war.  A big mistake, I've miscalculated.  My levies, along with my Vassal's and a regiment of mercenaries are overun by superior numbers as we tried to siege their stronghold.  We're forced to retreat. I sue for a white peace.  Luckily, thier own civil war pushes them to accept.  It is costly, my prestige takes a hit with the added insult of losing half my coffers in the treaty.  My armies now lay in tatters.  Time to lick my wounds and take lesson from my hastily planned attack. Next time I will be properly prepared.  Next time, victory will be mine.			"

SummaryAn amazingly complex and engrossing game that can make the hours fly by.ReviewCrusader Kings II is difficult to classify. It’s a grand strategy game, a sandbox game, and in some ways a political simulator. It also happens to be one of the best role-playing games I've ever played.  I’m not even sure where to begin describing it, but what I can say without reservation is that it’s extremely immersive and fun, which is quite a trick that developer Paradox Interactive pulled off when you consider that the vast majority of the gameplay takes place in menus.The premise is deceptively simple: you play as a king (hardly a surprise given the game's title), and your number one goal above all else is to have an heir in place who will claim your throne upon your death.  When your character dies, you assume the role of his heir, and so on down the line of succession.  Die without an heir and it's game over.But of course it’s not quite as simple as that.  As a king, you’re naturally going to want to expand your realm and accumulate wealth and prestige, and this is where you find the meat of the game.  When you start, you can choose to play as anything from a lowly vassal like a duke or a petty king ruling a single province to a monarch of an entire country.  This also serves as a secondary way to adjust the game’s difficulty since a duke or petty king is going to have a harder time of it than the ruler of an entire nation.And this is where things get interesting.  I call Crusader Kings II a role-playing game because it’s all about navigating the treacherous path of court intrigue and maintaining relationships with the other characters in the game.  Sometimes you might want to have a good relationship with someone, or sometimes you may want them to think very poorly of you, and there are numerous means for doing both, from performing favors, or handing out honorary titles (including Court Jester, which never makes the recipient happy), or even straight-up bribery.  If you have a troublesome vassal, you can try and woo him back into your good graces, throw him in jail, or plot to have him killed.  Any action you choose will always have long-term consequences, for good or ill.  For instance, if you arbitrarily throw someone in jail, or attempt to have them murdered and it’s discovered, you’ll take a relationship hit with other characters almost across the board, and this could be a problem if allies refuse to come to your aid during war, or you end up with a revolt on your hands, or other characters hatch their own plans to kill you or your heir!  It all becomes a delicate balancing act as you try to keep your friends (and enemies) happy while scheming to steal land and titles out from under their noses.In addition to good old fashioned political intrigue, you will also encounter a number of random story vignettes that present your character with various choices that create a short, branching narrative, the ultimate consequences of which could be positive or negative, depending on your decisions.When things come to blows, and they inevitably will, it’s time to raise an army and clash steel.  Unfortunately, this is not the most engrossing part of the game.  Your armies march around in multi-unit “blobs” represented by a single soldier sprite with a number indicating the size of the army and a small line representing its morale.  Essentially, if your numbers are higher than an enemy army’s numbers then you’ll (most likely) win the battle.  And that’s pretty much all there is to it: march your “blob” around, defeat other blobs, and lay siege to enemy provinces until your war score reaches 100% and you can force your foe to concede to your demands.  I’m not saying this is necessarily easy, and wars are extremely costly, and sometimes you’ll be thrown an unexpected wrinkle that will turn what you thought was an easy victory into a crushing defeat, but you’re not going to find detailed tactical gameplay here (although full disclosure compels me to mention that I’m not an expert in this game by any stretch, so there may be some nuance here that I’m missing).  At any rate, the simple combat mechanics are adequate because war really isn’t the focus of Crusader Kings II even if it is an important aspect given the setting.Crusader Kings II plays in real-time, but you can pause at any point if you need breathing room to untangle a particularly difficult political conflict.  You can still interact with the game when it’s paused, but your orders won’t take affect until you start the clock again.  This prevents the game from becoming overwhelming even when things get complicated, which can happen very quickly and often without warning.  Thankfully the interface is very well laid out and places the copious amounts of information you need to manage your empire within easy reach, usually no more than one or two mouse-clicks away.  However, it is a very complex game, and even with over 80-hours under my belt to date, I feel like I’ve still barely scratched the surface.  In order to understand Crusader Kings II, you need to have a basic understanding of Medieval politics and laws, and this isn’t something that most people possess.  For instance, a pop-up will inform you that you have a “Wrong type of holding in demesne”.  What does that even mean, and more importantly, how do you fix it?  Or you might discover that your kingdom is at risk of fragmenting into the hands of multiple petty rulers when your character dies because of a potential succession crisis.  Why is this happening, and what can you do about it?  The game’s manual and tutorial missions do a rather poor job preparing you for your career as a crusader king, so you’ll probably want to find some “Let’s play” videos or a strategy guide or two.  I also suggest keeping a web browser handy while you play because you’ll inevitably have questions throughout the course of the game.Graphically, Crusader Kings II is probably about as attractive as a game like this can be with the majority of the display occupied by a vast interactive 3D map.  Details are added and subtracted depending on your zoom level, so it’s easy to pull out for a quick overview and then zoom in close enough to see individual cities and holdings dotted across the landscape.  It also runs beautifully in Linux, which always scores extra points in my book.  Sound effects are pretty basic for the most part, but you’ll mostly be listening to the music anyway which is period appropriate orchestral selections.  It can get a little bit repetitive, but there are several music packs available as DLC to expand the score.Speaking of DLC, if you’re contemplating a purchase of Crusader Kings II, you might be staggered by the fact that there is, at the time of this writing, nearly $250 worth of full-priced DLC currently available, and you may find this off-putting, but consider this: the vanilla game offers a complete experience in and of itself and can give you hours of entertainment.  In fact, I would recommend you play it sans DLC at first to get a feel for the game and to decide which DLC actually appeals to you, because not all of it will (and you should probably wait until it’s on sale anyway to get the most bang for your bucks).  I personally only have around half of the available DLC including several expansions and some of the unit and music packs, but I don’t feel like I’m missing out simply because the other content doesn’t interest me.  I should also note that when Paradox does release a major expansion, it's always accompanied by a patch that adds new features and content to the base game for free.This review could easily be three times as long, and I still wouldn’t feel like I had given a comprehensive description of Crusader Kings II.  So let’s make this simple: It’s a great game.  Buy it.			"

												Crusader Kings II is a game from those masters of ""grand strategy"", Paradox Interactive. I never played the original Crusader Kings, but Crusader Kings II has been one of the most consistantly enjoyable experiences I've ever had with a strategy game. Even with 150 hours under my belt, I'm still gaining skill, and with every DLC, I'm encountering new events and new ways to play. Even the base game is a delight to play, but unlike many other games, the DLC is actually worth having, and every major DLC expansion adds a new dimension to the gameplay. When I first started playing, even with just a couple of hours of experience, I knew enough to be competitive. If you're new to Paradox Titles, I'd suggest checking out a ""Let's Play"" on YouTube, or reading T.J. Hafer's wonderful ""Crusader Kings Chronicles"" on the PC Gamer web site. The game is a sandbox, so your goals are your own. You can try to create an Empire, or you can just try to hold on to what you have at the start of the game. You can use military conquest to expand your holdings, or you can strategically marry and assassinate your way into greater power. Your options are limited only by your cunning and imagination.But it's so much more than just a strategy game. It's also got roleplaying elements. Every character has a set of five stats that range from 0 (totally incompetent) to 20 or higher (genius) that determine how he or she runs their County, Duchy, Kingdom, or Empire. Diplomacy makes your vassals and your neighbors like you more. Marshal determines how well you command your armies. Administrative determines how well you manage your finances, and how large a territory you can hold personally. Intrigue determines both your ability at plotting against your enemies and discovering plots your enemies are making against you. Learning has an effect on the rate of technological advancement, and several other factors.In addition to these five stats, each character has traits, both positive, like ""Brave"", ""Diligent"", or ""Just"", or negative like ""Craven"", ""Slothful"", or ""Arbitrary"". There are also numerous ""neutral"" modifiers, like ""Honest"" that increases your Diplomacy, but decreases your Intrigue. There are also genetic traits that can come into play, both good and bad. The first time you have a ""genius"" child, you'll be jumping for joy, and the first time you have an ""inbecille"", you'll be wondering how hard it would be to ""dispose"" of him. But be wary. That imbecille might be the only hope of continuing your line.Because that is what the game is about. It's not about your country. It's about your dynasty, your family line. Even if you start as the Emperor of the Holy Roman Emperor, and wind up as the Count of some random backwater in Eastern Europe, so long as your family line continues, your game continues. But even if you are the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, if you have no remaining members of your Dynasty, then it's game over.It's a complex, but not complicated, game. Make no mistake. There is a learning curve to this game, but once you've learned the basics, you will find yourself coming back to it again and again.			"

												If you are a fan of strategy games, and more specifically, grand strategy ganes (ig. Civ) crusader kings 2 is a must have game. The game begins in the year 867, or 1066 depending on if you own the ""The Old Gods"" expansion or not, and you must guide a noble family through the medievel era. This may seem bland to someone without experience with paradox interactive grand strategies, but it is certainly not. This game is very similar  to Game of Thrones(there is a Game of Thrones mod also) imagine playing as the lannisters, starks or any family in westeros of signifigance. As in Game of Thrones, intrigue is paramount. I have countless times murdered my children and siblings in the name of preserving my realm and i have been assassinated by my siblings and brothers countless times also. Intrigue however is not the only component of CKII, military, religious, and economic gameplay is as rewarding as Intrigue. When all of these elements work together, the Game is damn good. Imagine you are the king of Sweden. Your younger brother is the King of Norway and your uncle is your vassel, duke of Lappland with a measly 4 holdings(counties, castles, cities, and temples/churches/mosques). Your spymaster is unskilled and your uncles plot to claim your kingdom for himself has gone unnoticed. Even if the kingdom of Sweden is the most powerful of nations, you can still lose a war to revolting vassles. Especially if a foreign king like your afformentioned brother helps the rebels. It is gameplay like this that you experience in crusader kings but so much more dynamic than i could ever hope to explain on paper. In my opinion Crusader Kings II is the best grand strategy game ever, fans of the genre and newcomers alike can appreciate it: 9.5/10			"

												If you are a fan of strategy games, and more specifically, grand strategy ganes (ig. Civ) crusader kings 2 is a must have game. The game begins in the year 867, or 1066 depending on if you own the ""The Old Gods"" expansion or not, and you must guide a noble family through the medievel era. This may seem bland to someone without experience with paradox interactive grand strategies, but it is certainly not. This game is very similar  to Game of Thrones(there is a Game of Thrones mod also) imagine playing as the lannisters, starks or any family in westeros of signifigance. As in Game of Thrones, intrigue is paramount. I have countless times murdered my children and siblings in the name of preserving my realm and i have been assassinated by my siblings and brothers countless times also. Intrigue however is not the only component of CKII, military, religious, and economic gameplay is as rewarding as Intrigue. When all of these elements work together, the Game is damn good. Imagine you are the king of Sweden. Your younger brother is the King of Norway and your uncle is your vassel, duke of Lappland with a measly 4 holdings(counties, castles, cities, and temples/churches/mosques). Your spymaster is unskilled and your uncles plot to claim your kingdom for himself has gone unnoticed. Even if the kingdom of Sweden is the most powerful of nations, you can still lose a war to revolting vassles. Especially if a foreign king like your afformentioned brother helps the rebels. It is gameplay like this that you experience in crusader kings but so much more dynamic than i could ever hope to explain on paper. In my opinion Crusader Kings II is the best grand strategy game ever, fans of the genre and newcomers alike can appreciate it: 9.5/10			"

												It feels like this game was made for me. It's a highly detailed and story-driven Feudal Sim, and I love it. I chose it over the other paradox games because of the prospect of having to struggle within my own lands to get anything done. The DLC offer very different ways to play the different cultures, while still uniting it all in one map. Highly recommended if you are into this kind of thing, and it's especially good to start with a YouTube tutorial of some kind, especially reading the wiki. Has lots of depth.			"

												You know, I feel like ,compared to some of the great players (e.g. those mad tings' with 2000+ hours invested into the game) I really haven't experienced that much. In fact, I haven't even managed to run through a full game yet, that is both from the DLC-given 769 Charlemagne starting date and the vanilla 1066 date, and I like to consider myself a competent player - atleast I would hope so by this point... BUT, by my sweet black baby jesus' grace, it was when all of this hit me that I decided to write this review.That is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.400+ hours of gameplay, nearing 500, and I still haven't managed to finish a game? CK2 is the ultimate strategy out there. It doesn't recquire particularly acute battle-planning however, that is all done by a simple combat simulator and AI Martial Ability, no. This sort of strategy is that of court intrigue, seducing the Queen of Lombardy and marrying her so your heir becomes King of Italy whilst also coming from a family of barbaric Norse pagans?What? The predominantly Catholic Italians don't like the idea of having a Pagan King and try revolt against you? Beat them down then, that's what your well groomed retinues are for.But still your Council might find themselves growning a tad bit agitated with your ritual sacrifice of their fellow Christians and might attempt to, instead of overthrowing you competely, limit your power with diplomacy and the use of a strange concept. Democracy. Well, ♥♥♥♥ them, send your spymaster with his seditious intent to capture or kill them.All this in the meagre period of twenty years.Who knows what other trials, tribulations and resounding triumphs, await you upon your purchase of this game? Well to answer that. No-one. Because the possibilities are, literally, absolutely infinite.Oh and I also suggest shelling out, legit, everything in your wallet on the main DLCs, which are everything exluding Aztec Invasion.

												A solid example of a once great game ruined through pointless revisions and unnecessary changes to the core mechanics. After patch 2.5 the gameplay is more tedium and frustration than it is fun or interesting, and CKII has become so buggy that it's borderline unplayable as certain government types.This game has been progressively worsening for a quite a while now, but conclave has absolutely broken the experience.Why?-The council exists only as a gameplay obstruction as opposed to an interesting feature on it's own.-Managing anything larger than a small kingdom will now result in endless revolts to increase council power, with very little the player can do to avoid it.-Defensive pacts are an interesting idea, but ultimately don't play nice with the game mechanics and aren't very historically accurate. (For an excellent example I played as Carloman Karling and I had the invasion of Saxony event fire, due to my previous war to press my claim on West Francia almost every independent slavic pagan declared war on me to defend the Saxons. Which by the way, makes absolutely no sense and results in an almost unwinnable conflict.)-Shattered retreat suffers from a similar problem mechanically while being a good idea in theory, it simply doesn't work well in game and makes some conflicts ridiculously difficult or just pointless.(holy wars and prepared invasions are the best examples of this)-The new education system makes creating a decent heir mostly reliant on rng as opposed to a chosen guardian's existing traits.Despite all this I would still say this is a decent game, but I can't honestly recommend it anymore. If you're going to buy CKII, get it on sale and avoid some of the dlc. Also roll back to a patch prior to conclave for a better experience.			"

												Hello Gamers! PET here with my Crusader Kings II review!First of all this is a hard game to pick up but once you do it will create one of the best and unique experiences you ever encounter (in video games lol).If you follow my video at the end of the review I guarantee you will be able to pick up the game. If not...CK2 is a Grand Strategy Game. You will start around year 1100 and play until around 1300 (don't remember the exact dates. You can change the start year but the end year will be the same).CK2 is a game about your dynasty, about politics, about your vassals and about surviving your dynasty. One of the reasons why this game is hard is that it does not give you a purpose. You can do whatever you want and this might be confusing to some people. You will get that ""now what?"" experience. Not only that but you will be able to play with any king/duke/count in Europe. As you see I wrote a person title and not a country. Why? Because in CK2 you play with a person from a dynasty. Your purpose is to expand your dynasty, marry your sons so they can create children, marry your daughters to other powerful rulers so you will have a claim on that territory... oh yes yes...CK2 follows the feudal system and that's one of the reasons why people find this game hard. For example you can not declare war on another person without having a De Jure claim. What does that mean? Well it means that you are entitle to that territory because you might have a title that contains that territory. Oh yes, you have titles.Really, I think it's much easier to just watch my review & tutorial here:

My first king managed to live to 100yr, but once he got to like 50yr things started to go a bit downhill (Madness). My younger wife was very bitter after finding out i been having an affair for a number of years with another woman. So to take revenge she decided once she became my regent that she was going to claim more and more of my land as her own (For the good of the kingdom in her words..yeah right).This on my death and all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s i bread meant my hair didnt get to be king for very long before getting killed by one of his half brothers...This half brother then decided to mary into a muslim fraction. This wasnt much of a problem until his hair decided he wanted to follow his mothers religion and then went on to change the religion of Ireland and most of the UK that i claimed. Its now the year 1024, it seems everyone hates me.

												I will start by saying I really enjoy playing the games that Paradox creates. My first thought is to recommend their product. But then we start this DLC instead of update policy. Time and again I have seen this company release new content for their games (many of which seem based off of player mods, and add little to none in way of expanding upon it). I woudnt mind one here and there. Or perhaps if they didnt try to make you pay for portraits, music, and additional gameplay options. It's bad enough paying $15 for a DLC which does very little in the way of mechanics, but Paradox goes much further than that. They want to charge you for new music, new portaits, and new character models. EACH SOLD SEPERATELY. So basically, the games are amazing and fun, but the DLC policy has become so outragous and nickle/dimes you so much that I can NOT advise anyone to purchase their products.			"

												By far, one of the best games I've played in my lifeIn Paradox's game progression this one is the first, and it occupies middle ages from 1066 to 1452 (or from 867 if you get the DLC for it). In game you basically have to choose dynasty and play till you die or till the game itself ends. And it's really ♥♥♥♥ing difficult. You might get kicked out of your throne and die poor with no heirs or you can survive and be emperor of whole Europe.This game is great fun because:1) It is really hardcore2) The map is quite big, so variety of dynasties to play is really decent3) Things go quite different every time you play, so it doesn't become repetitive4) There are some quite competitive achievements in game, for example restoring Roman Empire or sample5) It is quite historically interesting, you can watch how things changed around 1000 years ago6) Nice graphically made landscape7) It's not just about having wars. It's about being a ruler. You will have to do a lot of things there, from starting and ending wars to marrying your offspringsWhy this game isn't flawless:1) Some really stupid and unrealistic things might happen. For example, Russian kingdom turning to catholic religion or black-skinned king of Britain (This is what I had only, most noticeable things)2) There are really many DLCs and getting them can sometimes be worthy, the most significant ones are like 8$3) Some DLCs are really stupid, for example the one with Aztec invasion. It's just plain idiotic.4) This game might be sometimes TOO hardcore. You won't be able to play it normally before you complete tutorial, so bother yourself with that. And it's gonna take you a lot of time to start playing good. I actually started becoming good at this game after 100h only and still would sometimes get ♥♥♥♥ed.Overall, this game is a great fun if you want some good time-spender, if you want some historical interesting events, if you're tired of real-time strategy games or if you just crave some difficult gameplay and not-so-stupid games. This is what you have to get then.9.8/10, would play again and again			"

												I played CK2 using ireland from the year 887( Or near enough to it). I managed to conqure the rest of Ireland, Take most of the UK from the lords and kings over there. My first king managed to live to 100yr, but once he got to like 50yr things started to go a bit downhill (Madness). My younger wife was very bitter after finding out i been having an affair for a number of years with another woman. So to take revenge she decided once she became my regent that she was going to claim more and more of my land as her own (For the good of the kingdom in her words..yeah right).This on my death and all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s i bread meant my hair didnt get to be king for very long before getting killed by one of his half brothers...This half brother then decided to mary into a muslim fraction. This wasnt much of a problem until his hair decided he wanted to follow his mothers religion and then went on to change the religion of Ireland and most of the UK that i claimed. Its now the year 1024, it seems everyone hates me. No one seems to want to marry my children, A number of different fractions are coming for my head and my gold is running low.10 out of 10: Would become most wanted death man in the world again.			"

												CK2: Used to be good, ruined by ahistorical, impractical, overpriced, and game-breaking DLC. Probably one of the few games left that charges you for cosmetics & add-ons in addition to the base price. Don't buy the DLC even on sale, best not support this business practice. Charging for cosmetics and add-ons are acceptable only when a game is F2P, and this mentality is spreading thoughout the gaming industry. Paradox used to release fewer but more complete DLC in the past, but they are regressing.Paradox: Godd*mit Johan, fix games instead of milking them. Fix AI instead of being lazy and putting a land passage across Otranto. For once in your life, read feedback outside of the Paradox forums. The reviews are negative for all your recent DLC. Stop acting like a butthurt kid when you see the slightest form of even constructive criticism.EDIT: Oh great, they released yet another DLC to fix the problems of the old one...EDIT2: Everyone seems to suddenly love the game again. Well I will not be fooled.			"

												This game was awesome. Key word 'was.' Poured a lot of time and effort into my Empire only to have an update absolutely ruin the ability to play any further. Apparently updates to this game have been doing this for awhile (making previous saves unplayable) the community would have you believe that plenty of warning is given on the forums. Whilst this may be true, purchase/playing of the game is in no way a binding agreement that a player must stay active on the forums and actively be a part of the community. Something you'll need to be (apparently) unless you don't want to be pre-warned about getting your save-games dicked. Of course there is plenty of warning about the available DLC in-game, but that takes precedence over anything else I guess... Great game, terrible update model. Extremely upset. Removed from my heart and /common file. :(EDIT: I gave the game a second chance and progressed well until receiving a sudden and inexplicable error message forced that game to a close too. I could not find any information online about what was happening so I signed up to the Paradox forums themselves and left a post in the relevant location asking for tech support. It has been viewed but gone unreplied to for the past two days. I guess you're scrwed whether you join the forums or not. In conclusion: don't purchase the game and don't support the developers. All in all a very frustrating experience playing (?) and dealing with their half-♥♥♥♥♥ performance in the gaming industry. Not good enough.			"

												After a whole lot of hours on this game, I feel I owe it a more detailed review.Crusader Kings 2, ultimately, is an experience. This is a good thing and it's most active selling point - It's not a game you win or lose, it's a game you craft stories from - as all the other reviews will likely show!It is a game that appeals to multiple playstyles. If you want to be the grand overseer, some sort of mini-god surveying all that you have and making incredibly far-sighted decisions about where to conquer, who to ally with and what wars to start, looking at it as a gamer rather than a character? You can.If you want to look at it as the character you are, say King Eucedis ""The Fat"" Salian of England, roleplaying as a man obsessed by excess, greed and pride, while simultaneously ruining future generations of your family tree by seducing all the courtier's wives and having a large pool of illegitemate children? You canIf you want to play it as a complete and total joviality, name your family the ""Megatrons"" and rename every single English city after each Sonic the Hedgehog level, because why not? You can.All of these and many more are games I've had. Sometimes the game hates you and wants you to suffer, such as letting your 25 year old genius, attractive king who has all the claims in the world die from a cough, leaving you to inherit as your 1 year old, dumb, hairlipped son, who immediately gets rebelled on by his better brother, leaving you a peniless and landless wreck. At other times, the game loves you and even though you played as a merciless, heartless father who had a child with his eldest son's wife (who also never had any more children) and then he immediately dies and because of your inheritance said child inherits, but the brother ends up staying loyal and true, which gives you more than enough forces to make the others kow-tow.All of the above scenarios have happened. More have too. More still will. If you enjoy having fun stories to tell people, or even fun stories to look back on, this game is for you.The only two downsides - The game has a lot of DLC, which all add a lot to the game. This is somewhat mitigated by them regularly being on sale, but the cost still adds up. I must admit though that even having that, I mostly still play as the Christian rulers that start off accessible, alongside the Norse - The key is to experiment after purchase of the base product with it online, as if the host has the DLC you can use it in an online match. That way you can get a feel for what you want. The second downside is the game layout. The game is not massive on visuals, aside from the pretty map and such, so most of it is small character portraits and menus. This has the side of making the game complicated because it's not initially easy to understand where you go wrong.But I promise you - if you put the time into the game, it pays off.			"

												Crusader Kings II is the ultimate medieval strategy game, period.  And this is coming from a guy that has a BA in history from Rhodes College with a focus on medieval studies.  It is the type of game that you won't instantly love or even understand.  That's because it's an incredibly deep and complex game that has almost infinite replayability.  You can play as a lowly count of a single territory and try to work your way up to king (or emperor).  You can also start as a duke, king or even William the Conqueror and try to hold onto England as a Norman! Along the way, there will be treachery, fighting with your vassals, fantastic feasts (where you even choose the food and entertainment), religious crusades, crazy random events, arranged marriages, succession wars, family and court politics, etc. etc!   For those of you who have played Europa Universalis IV, this game has some similarities but is more focused on personal relationships.  You play as a dynasty from a single bloodline.  If all of your heirs of the bloodline die out, it's game over!  When your ruler dies, depending on the laws you set, your heir takes over.  To top it off, this game has TONs of fantastic expansion packs.  Play as the vikings starting even early in the 900s or play as a merchant republic, etc. etc.  The game is so deep and detailed that you don't even need the expansions, but they will keep you busy for hundreds of hours more.  They really nailed the feudal system and all of its complex and crazy relationships.  I once built a castle in my home territory.  I gave it to a relative and thought I was safe.  They married a powerful princess from Norway who kept her title.  All of a sudden, I had a single foreign castle right in the middle of Ireland!  It reminded me of the French castle in Monty Python's Holy Grail! The music is fantastic and really fits with the period.  The one negative I will say is that the learning curve is steep and the tutorials are prettymuch awful.  To really play this game, you'll need to invest some time either reading a few guides or watching some tutorial videos.  (I recommend Ck2 guide for newbies youtube series by SeeKayEm99.  There's a ton of parts and a few things are outdated but it's still great for learning.  You only need to watch the first few to get the hang of things)  So, I would heartily recommend this game to someone who loves strategy games and a challenge as well as history.  Be warned that there's some micromanagement involved.  Sometimes, your heir will need a royal marriage and you'll need to spend some time looking at various matches and alliances around the world.  Anyway, pick this game up if you have patience, love strategy games, and don't mind a steep learning curve.			"

												Crusader Kings II is not Civilization. And, unlike other Paradox games such as the Europa Universalis series, it is not hard to learn. You play as a ruler, of a county, a duchy, a kingdom, or an empire. You choose initially from the set of rulers available at the start of the game, which is by default anyone in power in 1066 CE Europe (Further back with the Old Gods expansion) and from then on, things get rough. If your ruler dies, you then play as your immediate heir. If you have no heir, then you lose the game, so the simplest goal would be to have your dynasty survive the lenght of the game (some 400 years). Only there's so much more to do than survive. You have to plan marriages for your daughters and sons, deal with an often angry Pope, vicious neighbors with claims on your lands, angry subordinates who may be plotting to kill you or usurp your titles, a derelict king or queen who thinks they're posessed by the devil and are putting the kingdom you belong to on the fast track to destruction, an angry horde of mongols rapidly advancing, a holy war tearing apart a nearby kingdom, and so much more. It doesn't take long to get immediately caught up in the scheming and politics of even the tiniest duchy, and before you know it two hundred years have passed, kingdoms have risen and fallen, assassins have come and gone, plagues have ruined your best laid plans for succession, and you realize it's eight AM and you've been caught up in medieval rulership for all night.

												Your spymasters will discover plots to kill your spymaster, originating from your spymaster. Your ruler will have affairs with himself. You will cheat, lie, steal, plot, assassinate, wage war, carefully arrange marriage and dynasty laws to push your family to the upper echelons of success and then lose it all when your eldest son and heir has all the others killed and promptly dies of dysentry. Probably the most fun you'll have plotting the continuation of your fictional dynasty.			"

Just to name a few, you can assassinate your wife, assassinate your children, capture (and presumably ♥♥♥♥) women from noble courts so that your children will have claims on the mother's land, imprison people for eloping, blind and/or castrate anyone you imprison for any reason, among many others. When it comes down to it, the game is about expanding your holdings and increasing the wealth of your dynasty...at *any* cost. It's an amazing game and I highly recommend it!			"

												Deep and powerful trip into Western feudalism, not only as a historical period, but as a mindset. Should be brought into history classes to make people understand this way of thinking, which is not as medieval as one might assume.

If you like historical, A historical, dynasty, faction building, empire building, strategy, Medevil simmulation get this game.			"

												After a whole lot of hours on this game, I feel I owe it a more detailed review.Crusader Kings 2, ultimately, is an experience. This is a good thing and it's most active selling point - It's not a game you win or lose, it's a game you craft stories from - as all the other reviews will likely show!It is a game that appeals to multiple playstyles. If you want to be the grand overseer, some sort of mini-god surveying all that you have and making incredibly far-sighted decisions about where to conquer, who to ally with and what wars to start, looking at it as a gamer rather than a character? You can.If you want to look at it as the character you are, say King Eucedis ""The Fat"" Salian of England, roleplaying as a man obsessed by excess, greed and pride, while simultaneously ruining future generations of your family tree by seducing all the courtier's wives and having a large pool of illegitemate children? You canIf you want to play it as a complete and total joviality, name your family the ""Megatrons"" and rename every single English city after each Sonic the Hedgehog level, because why not? You can.All of these and many more are games I've had. Sometimes the game hates you and wants you to suffer, such as letting your 25 year old genius, attractive king who has all the claims in the world die from a cough, leaving you to inherit as your 1 year old, dumb, hairlipped son, who immediately gets rebelled on by his better brother, leaving you a peniless and landless wreck. At other times, the game loves you and even though you played as a merciless, heartless father who had a child with his eldest son's wife (who also never had any more children) and then he immediately dies and because of your inheritance said child inherits, but the brother ends up staying loyal and true, which gives you more than enough forces to make the others kow-tow.All of the above scenarios have happened. More have too. More still will. If you enjoy having fun stories to tell people, or even fun stories to look back on, this game is for you.The only two downsides - The game has a lot of DLC, which all add a lot to the game. This is somewhat mitigated by them regularly being on sale, but the cost still adds up. I must admit though that even having that, I mostly still play as the Christian rulers that start off accessible, alongside the Norse - The key is to experiment after purchase of the base product with it online, as if the host has the DLC you can use it in an online match. That way you can get a feel for what you want. The second downside is the game layout. The game is not massive on visuals, aside from the pretty map and such, so most of it is small character portraits and menus. This has the side of making the game complicated because it's not initially easy to understand where you go wrong.But I promise you - if you put the time into the game, it pays off.			"

												Pretty good game, and as they have just added India it's even better. But their is a good bit they should add maybe. Like more peace treaties and more events maybe? I feel the events are ruined because there aren't anymore events to experience. The mods make it better thought to, like CK2+. I wish they had more factions to, like to help the King out. Instead of bad factions. And I wish there were more things to fighting wise. Like This guys a good fighter and this guy sucks. I really like the idea of the duel system on A Game of Thrones mod. It was real interesting. Only because if you didnt have the right traits you died. And it was completely random also.			"

												Great game, but alas it has taken a wrong turn with the latest DLC; Conclave.This is not a review. Instead I'll give instructions to the buyers...I consider this game done before the latest expansion, and I do recommend buying this game and all the DLC that seem interesting (maybe not Sunset Invasion even if it seems interesting).And just to make sure you have exluded the game breaking DLC, revert the game from the Steam game beta participation to version 2.4.5.I think version 2.4.5 and most of the DLC released until it will give you at least few hundred hours of addictive gameplay...I do not have the latest and the second last expansion Horse Lords, but as the the expansions (dlc) are released, game ai, mechanics and map does change to include the content for the basic game. When you buy the DLC, you get to play the content yourself, instead if you don't have it, you cannot use it, only ai can. Also, you can disable the bought dlc any time if you do not want to include it (Sunset Invasion).I've not played the Conclave content myself, instead i played 50 hours after the update and didn't like most of the changes which seemed to have removed some of the prior content and replace it with poorly working substitute. It didn't make sense to buy it, so I just reverted the game to a point where it was working without it.Also, there are some other DLC that make changes to the basic game, so if you plan to play only with the basic game, maybe some very early version is the best way to go. My experience, I bought most of the DLC before I started playing. (Until Old Gods)			"

												So I started off as a lowly Welsh Count, a vassal of the King of Wales.  After a generations-long struggle to successfully build up enough strength to rise up against my king, the only son of my previous character was born.  A just, gregarious and well-loved leader saw a sudden surge of support from other Welsh Counts and even an Irish Duke across the Irish Sea.  After forming alliances and taking enough in taxes to bolster my growing army with another 3,000 men in the form of some European mercenaries, I challenged the Petty King of Wales and laid claim to each of his counties one by one.  The Kingdom of Brethonniad was born!150 years into the game, a complex web of marriage and strategic sowing of dynastic seeds in Irish wombs led to my eldest nephew, the Prince of Brethonniad and the heir to everything that I had fought for, not just lining up to inherit my crown but also preparing his own eldest son and heir to inherit not just the crown of Brethonniad but two Irish counties from his noble mother and, on top of that, a strong claim to the Isle of Man.This is the heir that the dynasty had been preparing the kingdom for all of this time.  Another kind and just character with military expertise and noble blood was coming, expected to unite Wales and Ireland against the English and begin to assert control over the whole of the British Isles.However, the elderly King of Brethonniad was not finished.In his dying years, he found a new lease of life following the death of his respected Norwegian wife and queen.  In his late fifties and of ill-health, the King sought a new wife with whom he could enjoy his dying days.  To the surprise of all involved, a child was conceived.  There was a new heir.      The previous heir was no longer next in line and his prodigal son, set to challenge the English, took a giant slip on his climb.Out of the frustration of those around him, the new king grew up to be a tyrant.  Imprisoning family members and mercilessly excecuting them at will left him with a rebellion on his hands.  Who was in charge of the rebellion? The previous heir, father of the prodigal son.  With little or no support from his vassals, the king was unable to recruit a strong enough army to quash the rebellion and lost his title to the usurper.  With only a female heir, not yet in her teens, he worried that she would not be strong enough to undo his destructive ways and recover the prestige of their lineage.  Little did that matter as he later remembered that he had changed the succession laws to absolute agnatic primogeniture in his proud idiocy and the titles passed on to a distant, obscure male relative married to the count of Fife.Wonderful game.  Would play again.			"

												Probably the best game Paradox has ever made. The game is a complex sandbox where you play as nobility in the real world, trying to forge your dynasty into every corner of Europe, Arabia or India. You can play anyone from a lowly count, up to the emperor of the medieval roman empires.It has happened that I've devilishly laughed with great geniune delight as I expanded my kingdom of Burgundy deep into the HRE, wondering for just a moment why I don't have any friends. However that was instantly replaced by rage and confusion as soon as I realized that my character had died ""under suspiscious circumstances"", and that I now had to deal with an astronomically awkward inheiritance.There are also many ways to challenge yourself though the game as you can choose to play either as a christian, muslim, viking or slavic nomad ruler - most often carving out a place in the world for yourself and your dynasty through conquest, murder and marriages. Every gameplay feels meaningful depending on who you choose to play as because every place and every situation your happen to find yourself in present new obstacles to overcome. It's only in the later part of the game when you tend to snowball that the game slows down.I recommend this game.			"

'nough said.Cons:- Some of the DLC doesn't seem worth the effort.- Occasionally slow gameplays (little to no events at all).Overall, I found it worth the money (bought collector's on sale).

												Crusader Kings II is a very good game. I think it's fun to play as a ruler and that you meet resistance along the way. You can pick ambitions, fulfill others ambitions so that they like you more. You can throw someone in prison, assassinate or excommunicate him/her but it might backfire on you. That CKII support mods is awesome, although I've only downloaded one so far.One of the best DLC:s I've bought is the Ruler Designer. With it you can change appearance, make the shield design as you want it and add traits. When I started playing this game I didn't have that many DLC:s and I felt that the base-game as it is was kind of boring. Luckily they sell the DLC:s cheaper from time to time. Now that I have played it for some time with the extra content I must say that it is much more fun. It's a shame that you have to pay extra money for DLC:s to be able to truly enjoy the gameplay. That's how it was for me anyway. The reward-system in this game could be better. Maybe some more in-game rewards in form of likes, money, prestige. To be able to get achievements on Steam, I have to play in Iron Mode. I have not dared to do that yet. It would be very nice if I could get some by just playing the game in any mode. CKII already has a lot of traits but I wouldn't mind to be able too choose among even more.I would absolutely recommend this game. If you like strategy then I think you would like CKII. It is not the easiest game. The longest rule I've achieved is until my Kings son took over after his fathers death. It was chaos from the start of the sons rule because he had some bad traits. The shortest rule I've experienced is one I've played recently. The man got sick and died shortly after. So many things can happen along the way and it's interesting to follow the rulers development. To try again with a new ruler after the last one failed. Something makes me keep playing it. Maybe it's the pace, the challenge or that you can customize so much. Or perhaps it's the freedom and choices. Doesn't really matter. I enjoy playing this and will keep doing just that. Maybe my new ruler will succeed where others failed. Maybe...			"

												Crusader Kings II is without a doubt one of the funnest most addictive games I have ever played. This game has a steep learning curve, and honestly I hated it to begin with, but after I started to figure out how to play the game it became extremely fun.  After playing this game I have found it almost impossible to go back to playing the Civilization series, a series which I loved, because this game to me is a lot deeper and more interesting  than Civ. The multiplayer in this game is also very fun, if occasionally a little buggy. I highly recommend this game, just try not to give up right away if you get frustrated with it.			"

												Classic Grand Strategy Game; if you enjoy the genre you will most likely enjoy the game. If you are new to the genre, check out a few videos out of a Let's Play to make sure you have a grasp of the game before playing, as the learning curve is quite steep.The setting is based in the Medieval period. However, unlike other GS games, you are managing a dynasty over a country a la Game of Thrones. Think controlling and expanding the Lannister fortunes versus managing the Kingdom of France. It is a sandbox game with no formal goals, but the idea is to have your dynasty members prosper and to slowly expand your realm to encompass more and more of the world. The game has some great events due to its superb writing and ultimately you can create some fascinating alternative history.			"

												This game came out of nowhere and CHANGED MY LIFE for the better. Every playthrough is completely unique, making this game infinitely re-playable. i have over 1000 hours logged and am not slowing down any time soon. Set your own goals and see what happens. There are limitless possibilites as to where and how you and your dynasty members will end up.I own all DLC and all of it is worth every penny. They add even more depth and options to an already nearly-overwhelming game. I cannot recommend this game strongly enough! CRUSADER KINGS 2 IS EPIC STRATEGY LIKE NO OTHER!!!

												This game without its DLC is very limited for example you can't play another country/county/state etc... unless their Christian and a Monarchy type goverment.The reason why i don't recommend it is because unless you'r willing to cough up the full 130 something euro for the game and all or the majority of its DLC it will feel like a fracition of what you thought it would be,but i suppose even then with it's limitations (in the Vanilla game,not with dlc) there is undoubtly great time to be in CK2 but no game should be able to get away with a price tag of 130 unless their gonna give something more then what i was supposed to have when i purchased the game.

												So, having played this game for 1000 + hours, i can honestly say, it is arguably the funest game i have ever played. With the deep modding support, And no one time being the same, this game is the ultimate Grand Strategy game.It does have a rather steep learning curve, but, if you stick with it you will be surprised how much fun you can have.Yes, there is a massive amount of DLC, but several are really optional that you don't NEED to have, some are fantasy (Sunset Invasion) And of course there are others that (in my opinion) are must haves:-Sword of Islam-The Old Gods-The Republic-Charlemagne (sorta)-Way of Life (again, sorta)-Horse Lords-Conclave (Slightly Annoying but still fun)-Monk's and Mystics-Raja's of India-Sunset Invasion (arguably the worst DLC relased, but, eh)-Legacy of Rome-The Reaper's Due-Son's of AbrahamThe list isn't in any order, just to show the primary content mods apart from everything else.So, in short, in my opinion this game is a must have for those whom love strategy games, and those looking for a new kind of experience.9.5/10			"

The amount of DLC they've ♥♥♥♥ out for this game is absolutely shameful. Discounting all the cosmetic stuff, most of the big content expansions are things that should have been in the game from the beginning, and frankly the game is nearly unplayable without at least a couple of them.Play it, it's great.

												To start off this game has been an amazing journey, I bought this because it was in my queue long ago. I am just a person who is interested in one strategy games and two historical games. This one fit the bill perfectly and when I purchased it I was extremely impressed. Before playing this I had never heard of Paradox nor played any of their games, after this game however, I love to play all of their games. This game is exciting and allows you to rule as your own medieval ruler after that you can do just about anything you want. The community for mods is also great and makes excellent improvements to the game the devs also have made excellent expansion packs. Many reviews will talk about the devs failures and how DLC is over priced. I do not agree with that in any way, I have slowly purchased most of the dlc and have loved every bit of it. The DLC add great content to the game and bring in new and interesting features. Yes the game is a lot of money if you purchase the game and then all the DLC however, how I like to see it as this you are getting multiple games out of one game. You want to play as a Viking you can do that, you want to play as a Muslim Caliph you can do that, you want to be a Catholic King you can do that, you want to be a Byzantine count you can do that. My point out of that is you can be anything in this game you get the chance to make your own story over and over and over again. Sure the game is not perfect however, no game is the game is special however, and this game will allow you to have a great time on it. The learning curve is steep and at some points extremely hard, thats okay though thats the fun of the game the harder you have to work the more spectacular the experience will be. I hope you enjoyed this review and I would recommend you begin playing this game.			"

												It was a tepid summer night and a fresh but soothing breeze flew over the landscape of the county. It wasn't just some county, it was the one county where Lady Justicia ruled fair and just. A county where no rules would be broken, no secessions could happen, where no farmer or subject would stand up against their beloved duke.This is the story of your county. After investing gold into the possibility of renaming the ancient old and unfitting county name, your county ""Anal for free"" felt renewed. Reforms flushed through your political system and your subjects were simply happy with what they had and felt treated fair in your feudal government.The pope tried to gain influence of your county once again, so you decided to do what the gods actually wanted from you and you moved back in time to relive the old roman religions, pray to Jupiter and from there you can achieve something even greater:  Restore the Imperium Romanum in its greatest fashion. Bring back peace, power and prosperity to every subject in the known world with you as their Caesar and with the hellenistic gods at your side.Your dream of restoring the Imperium was brought down to reality when someone knocked on the door behind the balcony you stood one.""My lord, you have to come out and do something! Quickly!!""You sighed. Once again, some vasall who doesn't like your new traditions tries to make himself and his fiefdom independant or join another county - obviously illegally, since you are their de jure feudal lord for hunderds of years already.You turn around and look into the blue eyes of your servant. She was a young girl, merely 20 and already mother of 16 children of which 12 were mongrels. However, when she was walking through your capital, trying to climb over the piles of garbage and excrements that once again piled up in the middle of the main market, you couldn't resist to stop your palanquin and have her join you.It was the best sex you had in your long 50 year old life. Your other twentyfour wives didn't really like the new girl, but you had all right to rule both over your god given county as well as over your women, so none of them actually had a choice and those who disagreed with that simply died in a tragic carriage accident.You slowly walked over to her and touched her face. She cringed for a moment and looked at you with her begging, big eyes. You ignored your empathy and pushed her back inside, onto your bed. Quickly you tore down her dirty dress and without even really noticing, you slapped her eleven times because she started to scream and begged you to not do what you decided to do seconds ago.""P-p-p-please my lord, not again, I'm already pregnant again!"", she begged. Without even thinking about stopping for a second, you simply whispered: ""No worries, I'll clear that pipe and make room for a new one.""You felt the feeling of pure power when you sensed the warm, moist sensation on what you called the Small Lord. What an excellent feeling that was. This was the reason you beheaded twelve of your former wives and it was the reason you got the county in the first place, because who could have thought that the former duke died only two days after you married her daughter in an orderly way (because you bribed him before of course), so that you became the next one to herit the county.It was the sensation that made the world true and it should be the one that would keep humanity alive for another 1000 years at least.Your servant screamed again and you simply pressed your sweating hands on her mouth, pressing so hard that you wondered if you would break her petite chaw if you pushed just a little more.Slowly you moved the Small Duke back and forth, increasing the great sensation that made you feel comfortable and it wouldn't be long until you felt the power of a thousand suns pressing inside your duke. The power that empowered mills to crush wheat, the power that made it possible for a ox to plow your land for the farmer that was working on it. You moaned as your speed increased even further and your pressure became unsustainably high. All of the sudden, your inner steam was released through the valve that the gods gifted to you inside of the greatest of all limbs. You kept laying for a moment longer, then got up and went back to the balcony. Your glance moved slowly over the peaceful fields that your workers had worked on over the day to capture as much of the sun's power as possible to keep your war machines running and fill your treasury.The moon watched over what the gods gifted to you and you were happy. After turning around, you realized that, once again, another servant could not keep up with your power and had to concede at your might. ""Oh well"", you thought, ""I'm sure she got enough money to pay Charon for her last trip.""Quickly you grabbed her leg and threw it out of your now blood filled bed, so that she landed on the other two corpses that you forgot to throw out last morning. You called for your only male servant that you employed only for the reason of reliability and had him move them all out of your chamber.You went back on the balcony and took a last glance at the farms - your farms - that were burning. You ignored the sounds of dying farmers and screaming children, while the troops of the neighbor county moved their trebuchet in position to hit your castle below you. Thousands of armed soldiers who tried to take away what you alone owned to enslave your people and make them part of another empire.The smell of burning wood and blood filled your nose. It was a good night.And it was good to be the king.			"

You must LOVE Grand Strategy games for enjoying it, since here you have to take next to everything into account: Not only making sure that your territory is prosperous and that you have a nice economy, but also taking real care of diplomatic relations, religiosity, lineage (you don't want to lose because you had no children), vassals and liege...But, how is it that I vote it negative? The DLC.There are a lot of DLC that are way too expensive for what they bring. It really is annoying to see such prices for things that should be in the original game, such as new textures for armies or new portraits.			"

It takes a lot of time to learn, but can be very fun. It simulates family, friendships, rivalries, etc. Because of the complexity, it can be very intimidating for new players, so only buy it if you're willing to put in the massive amount of time it takes to familiarize yourself with the game's basic mechanics.

												This game is only worth it if you've played other strategy games and gotten bored because there isn't enough detail.You can plot to kill a member of your court, join a war, start a war, arrange marriages, imprison people, execute those people and quell some rebellious villagers while you're at it.In my game I helped my uncle take over Norway and once he had won using his wealth and considerable armies I had him assassinated and inherited it all at almost no cost to myself. Felt very game of thrones-esque.The one thing to be warned of is that since I bought this game a couple years ago the developer has removed things from the game and resold them as DLC, they've also added a bunch with DLC and continue to do so but my advice is to be careful with your money because you can easily overspend on this game to have a more ""complete"" experience.*EDIT* I should add that this game is very poorly optimized so even though it's a very fancy 2D game you can easily encounter very significant FPS problems given that the game seems to only utilize one CPU core. It starts off strong but the longer the game the more Ai characters your computer has to manage and that slows it down considerably.			"

												I've spent waaaaay too much time in this game whether modding or playing it.This game certaintly has a hard learning curve but once you understand it the game is incredible.  I recommend choosing the Canary islands and speeding up the game for around 30 years and then saving and reentering as a random person in the world.  It is incredibly satisfying seeing the insanity that is possible and slowly working your way up the ranks.Even aside from the world the game brings, if you don't like medieval Europe then get a mod that is a post-apocalyptic North America or Skyrim or Game of Thrones.  You can add magic, werewolves, and many other assortment of Fantasy beings.  There's a mod that completely transforms the game into the space age.  Counties are now worlds and it adds a ton more content with all new cultures and religions.Even better than all that, if you don't like a small part of the game, even part of a mod, you can just take it out.  The coding language is incredibly easy to grasp and you can remove or change pretty much everything in the game.  The only real downside of the coding side of things is the fact that there aren't really many guides out there and the ones that are out there are kind of lame and lack support.  That is all forgiven by me though as you can easily reference other mods and the game code itself to see how they do things.To add even onto that the console in the game is well done with numerous commands.  If you want to cheat you can cheat and if you want to play legit you can play legit.I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who has some time and the small commitment to learn the game.			"

												I do think I could write rivers of ink about this game but, mostly, that would be missing the point of a good review, in particular a review that should be good for new player.So let's start with basics and the game's feeling: you control a dinasty, you get to decide things about your realm, your subjects and your family members... and then your ruler dies horribly and then you get a new character and everything can change (usually for the worse, true GOT style).There is little logic in Crusader Kings II mechanics, and most of time this happens because it actually reflects historical Feudalism. If you like logical strategy games you are mostly in the wrong place.That does not mean that you cannot find your logic trail here and there bust most of the time you just need to KNOW what triggers what. It is mostly about knowledge and less about strategy.That said the best part is the narrative side. The mix of events, character personalities and objectives can create funny stories.It is, and it has been for a while, my ""just 5 more minutes"" game, replacing Civilization, and I am quite confident it will stay like that for a while.If you like this mix but also more coherent and hardcore strategy experience move toward Europa Universalis IV. That is the agme for you			"

												Ive done pretty much all with this game...from a norse raider seeking to take over all of England, to a muslim sultan sitting on my borders awaiting the Ilkhanate's invasion to face the greatest of the khan's.Very enjoyable, highly replayable, with more dlc's to come that will add even more flavor. (Raja's of India incomeing!)Playing from 867 (Old Gods) or 1066 (base) millions situations you can brew up. With the Ruler Designer DLC it expands to near limitless porportions and possiblites with a ever growing game.If your new to the series it may seem large but it is highly acessible and still complicated enough to intrigue beyond a few hours.Returning Veterans from CK or even EU3 will find it similar enough to understand but also it has had so much more added to keep it a challenge for all.

												A Grand piece of work in the Grand Strategy Genre of Grand Strategy games...Humor aside, the game has a strong focus on managing relationships (especially amongst your vassals) and guiding your dynasty from the Dark Ages to the High Middle Ages. The ""Sandbox"" effect and replayability of Crusader Kings II is by far it's most prominent feature, no two play-throughs will ever be similar. The Scope and scale of the game, and it's gameplay depth have been greatly increased since it's launch by many well-priced ""core expansions"" (Sword of Islam, Old Gods, The Republic, Way of Life, and Horse Lords). Offering countless hours of replayability, a good level of gameplay depth, and a vibrant modding community, Crusader Kings II is probably (in my opinion) one of the best Strategy Games of all time.

												This game is only worth it if you've played other strategy games and gotten bored because there isn't enough detail.You can plot to kill a member of your court, join a war, start a war, arrange marriages, imprison people, execute those people and quell some rebellious villagers while you're at it.In my game I helped my uncle take over Norway and once he had won using his wealth and considerable armies I had him assassinated and inherited it all at almost no cost to myself. Felt very game of thrones-esque.The one thing to be warned of is that since I bought this game a couple years ago the developer has removed things from the game and resold them as DLC, they've also added a bunch with DLC and continue to do so but my advice is to be careful with your money because you can easily overspend on this game to have a more ""complete"" experience.*EDIT* I should add that this game is very poorly optimized so even though it's a very fancy 2D game you can easily encounter very significant FPS problems given that the game seems to only utilize one CPU core. It starts off strong but the longer the game the more Ai characters your computer has to manage and that slows it down considerably.			"

												7/10. Buy it if you're willing to make the commitment.Essentially this game is a medieval story generator (albeit a very complex one). It takes a lot of time to learn, but can be very fun. It simulates family, friendships, rivalries, etc. Because of the complexity, it can be very intimidating for new players, so only buy it if you're willing to put in the massive amount of time it takes to familiarize yourself with the game's basic mechanics.

												This game... ahh this game. I was introduced to the world of Paradox games via EU3, and it was during the wait for EU4, it's acclaimed successor, that I fell into the world of Crusader Kings 2. Before anything else I will tell you this, Crusader Kings 2 is one of my favorite games of all time. I have spent countless hours having absurd amounts of fun staring at little marching sprites and glorified statistics pages on my computer screen. I have put more planning into securing lands, titles, marriages, etc in this game than I have on probably most anything in real life. I wouldn't have it any other way. The sheer amount of DLC is abusive and must be bought at massive steam discount. Much of it is purely aesthetic and need not actually be bought at all. But this is made up for with the sheer number of quality mods, including huge overhauls like my personal favorite Game of Thrones one. CK2 is basically the gaming embodiment of Game of Thrones whether the blades my little commanders are wielding are Valyrian or Damascus Steel.The point is you should buy this game. If you like strategy, if you like grand strategy, hell if you like court intrigue on TV, you will like this game. The learning curve can be a little steep. But a little effort to learn the game is paid back tenfold with endless story forging opportunity. Because that's what this game is, the most incredible merger of sandbox strategy and deep plot there ever was. Hopefully the people in your life will be at peace with seeing you less often. "

												I've spent waaaaay too much time in this game whether modding or playing it.This game certaintly has a hard learning curve but once you understand it the game is incredible.  I recommend choosing the Canary islands and speeding up the game for around 30 years and then saving and reentering as a random person in the world.  It is incredibly satisfying seeing the insanity that is possible and slowly working your way up the ranks.Even aside from the world the game brings, if you don't like medieval Europe then get a mod that is a post-apocalyptic North America or Skyrim or Game of Thrones.  You can add magic, werewolves, and many other assortment of Fantasy beings.  There's a mod that completely transforms the game into the space age.  Counties are now worlds and it adds a ton more content with all new cultures and religions.Even better than all that, if you don't like a small part of the game, even part of a mod, you can just take it out.  The coding language is incredibly easy to grasp and you can remove or change pretty much everything in the game.  The only real downside of the coding side of things is the fact that there aren't really many guides out there and the ones that are out there are kind of lame and lack support.  That is all forgiven by me though as you can easily reference other mods and the game code itself to see how they do things.To add even onto that the console in the game is well done with numerous commands.  If you want to cheat you can cheat and if you want to play legit you can play legit.I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who has some time and the small commitment to learn the game.			"

(BEWARE STEEP LEARNING CURVE)<by this i mean a good 6 hours or so to get the basics. Even after this you are always learning something. would recommend Arumba's CK2 Tutorial Series on youtube. Also great to watch to get an idea of the features in the game and the level of depth involved.Features.Manage your dynasty.Plot to kill other characters in the game. Amusing events and decision based on your characters traits and ambitions(Of which you can manage once you learn the game).Conquer lands for your county/duchy/kingdom/empire.Manage your council and court.And many many moreIf you are still reading now for my reviewI enjoyed 90% of this game, although there are thing's that paradox could have done better such as the warfare,Building management, religion and the whole pope minigame, But this is still a great title and i was very happy with my purchase. I spent hours on hours managing my dynasty,Court and my council. While this was happening i was also plotting against my enemies and even my own subjects in my kingdom/empire who were a troublesome sight to my reign. Also had to help my allies and keep an eye on my dynasty members(sisters/daughters) in particular, who i married off to people in larger empires outside my lands who i had high plans for. Overall this game is outstanding if you enjoy a nice in depth/complex empire and dynsaty management system.			"

												Crusader Kings 2, the inbreeding & murdering simulator where you control over your independent ( or not ) state and either horribly die to muslims, pagans or the Holy Roman Empire. Also your dynasty has other independent kingdoms under their rule and you're their heir, so have fun plotting to kill ONE of them for 10 years only to have them get a child, another child and another after that. Then you realise you're a pagan as well and you could have just gone for the subjugation of Norway + Denmark. Suddenly you're in Spain and the muslims kick your ♥♥♥ until your daughter marries the 9th princess of the HRE and suddenly you own Jerusalem. Also it's been two days since you started playing.			"

												A game like no other. Yes, it is mostly watching the map and sometimes giving orders (which means clicking 2 or 3 buttons). But if you want a medival simulation as realistic as possible, then this is the game for you. Just do not expect a lot of action going on. Also do not expect a real-time or turn-based strategy game. This game is not about conquering the world (Europa Universalis IV might be more your game then...), it is about simulating the feudal system. Therefore, there are mechanisms in the game, such as inefficient taxation when you own too many provinces or the gavelkind succession laws that splits your realm between your children when you die. While these might look like huge fun-blockers for an average gamer, they perfectly make sense in this game. Again, this is a feudal simulation and it excels at this.Recommended DLCs: The Old Gods, Sons of Abraham, Sword of Islam, Legacy of Rome.For long-term playability: there is a huge amount of mods, including some total conversion mods that put you in the world of Middle-Earth (Lord of the Rings) or Westeros (""Song of Ice and Fire"" aka ""Game of Thrones"").

												This is one of best strategy games on the market. It has one of the steepest learnign curves of any game I have every played. I highly recommend dumping the time required into so that you can get immersed in one of the best strategy games ever. On top of that, the developers, Paradox Interactive, regularly update the game along with the DLC that comes out. Crusader Kings II also stands as a reasonable example of good DLC. All of the DLC packs were made post launch and some of them are incredibly high quality. 8/10, would buy again.			"

												If you know of this game you've probably heard it refered to as a ""sibling murder, incest, warmonger, and religious intolerance map simulator"" or something of the like. While this is a humurous synopsis of the experience - and mostly true - it's not very helpful if you're trying to decide whether or not to dump copious amounts of cash into this thing. I mean, just look at all the DLC. It's at least 160 something odd dollars for all of it. So, is it worth it?The short answer: maybe. I know that's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ short answer, but hear me out. This game is niche. Very, very niche. It's unique certainly, but that does not change the fact that you could very well absolutely hate it. For starters, if you're thinking of making this purchase and have not played other games like this one (Europa Universalis etc.) then go watch Arumba's guide on how to play it. Also, pay attention to the fact that it's 22 videos long of about 18 minutes each. Granted, they are very in-depth, but this does not change the fact that understanding how this game works is not easy. It's an experience, and you will have to put time and effort into this game to get any sort of rewarding feeling for playing it. However, once you reach that point it becomes something very fun. Suddenly your son dieing of small pox leaving your daughter the only one to inherit becomes a challenge, rather than a guaranteed game over. Your neighbor converting to a different religion becomes an opperunity, not a reason to cower hoping that they won't declare war. The Pope becomes your ""friend"" rather than the guy that excommunicates you so your neighbor can steal your ♥♥♥♥. It goes on and on.Now, I like this game. I want that to be clear. However, this is not a game for everyone. It's not a game made for everyone either, hence the price point. This game in itself is a bit of a hobby, and while the price is stupidly high, it's about 6 or 7 expansions of decent content and a butt load of not so decent penny grabs. However, playing without all the dlc is very different from playing with all the dlc, and the game with dlc is objectively better most of the time. It's got more content, a bigger map, more events, religions, etc. As such, if your on the fence about this game, I'd suggest waiting until it goes on sale - as it does usually every so often - and pick up the whole thing for about 25~30ish dollars. At that price I'd hands down suggest this game to anyone with even a remote interest, but whether or not it's worth the full 160 is your decision, and you might regret it.Onto what this game actually is. In essence, you play as a family, not a single character. You do play as one person at a time, but you are survived by your children or relatives. You build power through war - which is not as exciting as it sounds - and intrique - which is. This game is not about the combat. It matters, yes, but playing a warmonger is only fun for about the first 80 hours put into a dynisty before you own all of Europe and are expanding into uncivilized lands. It is - above all - a game about the sibling murder, the incest, the bribing, the corruption, the intrigue, the homosexuals, the lovers, the concubines, the children, the murdering of the children, the arranged marriages, the raiding, the power struggles, the underlings -  the dirty, dirty unloyal underlings - the castle building, the character improvement, the ruling, and - above all - the characters. This game has no story, and yet the best story of any game I've ever played. Everything that happens is your legacy. You murdered the duke and stole his titles, well that's now part of your family legacy. Married into Royalty. That's there too. The whole game is about building your own alternative histories where the Scottish get invaded by the Moors and become Muslims, where Russia is formed early and fends off the mongols, where the Viking Pagan Empire stretches from Iceland to India. It's about doing whatever the hell you want, and it's glorious.This game is fun, and half of the fun is figuring out why it's fun. But for the love of all that is watched over by Zun, don't spend 160 bucks on the thing if you're unsure it's your cup of tea. It might be the best tea you've ever had, but wait until it's on sale.

												The sheer brutality of ruling Medieval Europe made available to you on your computer. I doubt I will ever have the ""Paragon of Virtue"" trait in any of my games. In order to be a strong leader you have to be smart, keep your vassals happy, forge alliances, make sure your heir is strong and that he inherits all of your holdings. I bought the Charlemagne expansion pack, and I am currently playing Charlemagne.Crusader Kings 2 is an awesome alternate history generator- I was able to marry Gisela into the Byzantine Imperial family (historically the attempt to marry her to Leo, Constantine V's son, did not happen since the contract was broken. In real life she became a nun, and ultimately was the abess of Chelles Abbey), which provided the foundation for a formal alliance with the Byzantium in the game I am playing now. I can't wait to see how history unfolds based on this, and all of the other choices I have made up to now. The only drawback to the game is that it's really hard to play the game ""out of the box"". The tutorial modes are not that great. I had to watch a few videos of gameplay on Youtube, enough to get a basic grasp of the game. I watched these two and went on with my own designs for ruling. This is the better of the two gameplay vids that I watched:

												Played this game alone and I married my cousin. I played multiplayer with my cousin and then married my cousin.10/10 Best cousin marriage simulator. Good for the whole realm.But for real, this game is absolutely incredible. I remember when I first saw this game. It was about three years ago and I totally thought this game looked like an overly complicated piece of junk. And boy, was I half right. After totally brushing off this game I started getting really into Civ V. I really loved how immersive the game was and how it wonderfully wove together culture, technology, and history. Eventually, after 200 hours of gameplay, I grew tired of that game and moved on. I moved on to Warband and played over 200 hours of that wonderful game. Yet I still grew tired of it.So I looked online for more strategy games and I came across this game again. At this point I was desperate for a strategy game that could also immerse me in a beautiful world while also giving me something I would take pride in fighting for. So I gave this game a chance and after 500 hours I am still playing this game. Crusader Kings 2 is an amazing grand strategy game that puts you not only in charge of a realm, but in charge of your family's house.  The goal of the game, if there is one to be found, is to bring as much glory to your realm and family name as you can. This can be attained by many different means and that is one of the things that makes this game great. You are put into a position of power in the Middle Ages and destiny is yours to write. However, this game can throw terrible twists your way. Your great genius leader can be killed in battle leaving your young daughter to take the throne in a world that hates female rulers. Or maybe you will find yourself hoping your King-Jeoffery-of-a-son dies so that way your strong, attractive, and genius son can take the throne. Or my greatest nightmare: You can be playing as an Eastern European nation and the Mongolian Hordes begin to knock on your door. Crusader Kings is one of the greatest games I have every played. It is wildly complex and can take over 50 hours to master. But don't let that stop you from giving this game a try. Because once you get a feel for how the Crusader Kings 2 world works, you can let your ambitions run free and carve out a glorious realm with characters that somehow manage to create a story that seems like it could have happened. 10/10 would have my vassals revolt against my 16 year old female ruler during a Mongolian invasion for Poland so I can inherit France and the HRE again.

												Let me describe how my first Crusader Kings 2 game began and you'll hopefully appreciate the fun that this game can offer:my character was over 60 year old Duke of southern Ireland. I had two sons, eldest of which was to be my successor, but who had such personality quirks that I really didn't think he would be the right heir. I preferred the younger son. So I sent the eldest on the most dangerous assignment I could - collecting taxes and hoped for the best (or worst). At the same time I noticed that I had good relations with France and the king of France happened to have two daughters (princesses) in the ripe age for marriage. I tested my luck and offered to wed the other and my eldest son could wed the other. Luckily the king accepted my proposals and there I was, married to a french princess. Not long after the marriage I decided to start fooling around with the other princess as well, because you can't go wrong with two french princesses and as my son was all the time fetching taxes, you had to give some warmth to the lonely french woman in another country. Not long after I got good (bad) news that my son had been killed on his taxation trip and I managed to get the right son to be my lawful heir. I kept the princesses though to myself naturally. At this point I noticed that the french king had an heir, son of age 8 or so. This wouldn't do because I wanted to get France for me as well so I put some plans into work and decided to assassinate the brat. I went a bit over the top though because I invested so much money into the assassination that it had approximately 300% success rate and indeed, after a while I got notice that he was at the same time thrown from the balcony, put into fire and shot with a crossbow. But if you want to get rid of a french king-to-be you better make it right the first time, can't be too careful!			"

												If games could talk, the stories this one would tell would both revolt you, and enthrall you. Like the time I, as the Emperor of Hispania and King of Aquitaine, Ireland, Brittany, and Wales managed to have brothers in charge of each holy order and also have an anti-pope as a daughter-in-law. Other players can tell you stories just as fantastic, and some can tell you ones that will cause your jaw to physically drop. Now, grab your pen, and go write your stories.			"

												Crusader Kings 2 is Paradox Interactive's most accessible grand strategy game to date. It is still not for the feignt of heart, but for those who love history and can take the time to learn the mechanics of the game, grand adventures await which are only limited by your own imagination to attempt to follow history or rewrite your own.

												This game has stolen about 900 hours of my life... it'll steal 900 more before I'm dead. Buy it, buy all its expansions, it's great. You could describe it as a medieval dynasty simulator. Have you ever wanted to seduce your own sister, have 8 children with her, then kill 7 of them so the best one will inherit your land and titles when you die? In Crusader Kings 2 all this and more is possible. And by god is it ever fun!			"

												A Grand piece of work in the Grand Strategy Genre of Grand Strategy games...Humor aside, the game has a strong focus on managing relationships (especially amongst your vassals) and guiding your dynasty from the Dark Ages to the High Middle Ages. The ""Sandbox"" effect and replayability of Crusader Kings II is by far it's most prominent feature, no two play-throughs will ever be similar. The Scope and scale of the game, and it's gameplay depth have been greatly increased since it's launch by many well-priced ""core expansions"" (Sword of Islam, Old Gods, The Republic, Way of Life, and Horse Lords). Offering countless hours of replayability, a good level of gameplay depth, and a vibrant modding community, Crusader Kings II is probably (in my opinion) one of the best Strategy Games of all time.

												I've never found a strategy game better than Crusader Kings II. I've owned it for nearly two years (ignore my playing hours, I actually have two copies of CK II; one from gamersgate, and one on Steam I picked up off the humble bundle), and I LOVE it. It's stunning in depth and complex like few other games, yet I found it easy to pick up and learn. Anyone who likes royalty, strategy, or family politics will love this game. Graphics are great; beautiful even. Very few strategy games I've played have such beautiful graphics in every area - character portraits, interface art, maps - normally something out of those lets you down. To mention it comes with its own, original music - beautiful, fitting classical pieces.I've found it to have infinite replay-ability. Not only because there are so many different characters you can try out (nearly anyone in mainland europe, and with DLCs all of India and the middle east), but because it has a great AI that always makes the world different each time. In the footsteps of real medieval europe, inheritance can change the map fundamentally. Play historically and rebuild the empires of a dynasty, or just conquer a whim - both are fun.This game is also constantly updated. Paradox has a great DLC policy where you get nearly every bit of content without the DLC just in the updates - all the DLCs do are to make characters playable, introduce new starts and new interface themes. So if you don't want to pay, you don't have to; you still get most of the experience, and you won't be left behind if you want to play multiplayer with others. There is no DLC wall. Not to mention DLCs can be easily turned on and off via the launcher.So much content has been added since I began playing, and the game is always getting better - just recently they doubled the map size, an enormous amount of work for Paradox, nearly 2 year after the game came out. My ratings?Music - 9/10Graphics - 8/10. Only thing that could be improved is player portraits might be higher-res.Gameplay - 10/10Replayability - 10/10Updates - 10/10Support - 9/10Overall - 9/10.

												If you know of this game you've probably heard it refered to as a ""sibling murder, incest, warmonger, and religious intolerance map simulator"" or something of the like. While this is a humurous synopsis of the experience - and mostly true - it's not very helpful if you're trying to decide whether or not to dump copious amounts of cash into this thing. I mean, just look at all the DLC. It's at least 160 something odd dollars for all of it. So, is it worth it?The short answer: maybe. I know that's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ short answer, but hear me out. This game is niche. Very, very niche. It's unique certainly, but that does not change the fact that you could very well absolutely hate it. For starters, if you're thinking of making this purchase and have not played other games like this one (Europa Universalis etc.) then go watch Arumba's guide on how to play it. Also, pay attention to the fact that it's 22 videos long of about 18 minutes each. Granted, they are very in-depth, but this does not change the fact that understanding how this game works is not easy. It's an experience, and you will have to put time and effort into this game to get any sort of rewarding feeling for playing it. However, once you reach that point it becomes something very fun. Suddenly your son dieing of small pox leaving your daughter the only one to inherit becomes a challenge, rather than a guaranteed game over. Your neighbor converting to a different religion becomes an opperunity, not a reason to cower hoping that they won't declare war. The Pope becomes your ""friend"" rather than the guy that excommunicates you so your neighbor can steal your ♥♥♥♥. It goes on and on.Now, I like this game. I want that to be clear. However, this is not a game for everyone. It's not a game made for everyone either, hence the price point. This game in itself is a bit of a hobby, and while the price is stupidly high, it's about 6 or 7 expansions of decent content and a butt load of not so decent penny grabs. However, playing without all the dlc is very different from playing with all the dlc, and the game with dlc is objectively better most of the time. It's got more content, a bigger map, more events, religions, etc. As such, if your on the fence about this game, I'd suggest waiting until it goes on sale - as it does usually every so often - and pick up the whole thing for about 25~30ish dollars. At that price I'd hands down suggest this game to anyone with even a remote interest, but whether or not it's worth the full 160 is your decision, and you might regret it.Onto what this game actually is. In essence, you play as a family, not a single character. You do play as one person at a time, but you are survived by your children or relatives. You build power through war - which is not as exciting as it sounds - and intrique - which is. This game is not about the combat. It matters, yes, but playing a warmonger is only fun for about the first 80 hours put into a dynisty before you own all of Europe and are expanding into uncivilized lands. It is - above all - a game about the sibling murder, the incest, the bribing, the corruption, the intrigue, the homosexuals, the lovers, the concubines, the children, the murdering of the children, the arranged marriages, the raiding, the power struggles, the underlings -  the dirty, dirty unloyal underlings - the castle building, the character improvement, the ruling, and - above all - the characters. This game has no story, and yet the best story of any game I've ever played. Everything that happens is your legacy. You murdered the duke and stole his titles, well that's now part of your family legacy. Married into Royalty. That's there too. The whole game is about building your own alternative histories where the Scottish get invaded by the Moors and become Muslims, where Russia is formed early and fends off the mongols, where the Viking Pagan Empire stretches from Iceland to India. It's about doing whatever the hell you want, and it's glorious.This game is fun, and half of the fun is figuring out why it's fun. But for the love of all that is watched over by Zun, don't spend 160 bucks on the thing if you're unsure it's your cup of tea. It might be the best tea you've ever had, but wait until it's on sale.

												Crusader kings II is the holy grail of grand strategy games. On the grand scale you control a king and his realm (Or a duke or count if you'd like) and make various decisions to benefit it. On the smaller scale of things, you become entwined in a web of international politics and plots, domestic politics and plots, feudal succession laws and many other things. It's a game where everything in the world actively affects everything else in the world. DLC is not required at all, but it does double up the game size with each DLC, each adding even more replay value to a great game.			"

												This as you may noticed from my play time on it that I love this game. This game is awesome, I wish though that the battles were more designed along the lines of the Total War series. The length of the game is awesome though. Same with the in-depth in the role you can play in a county, dukedom, kingdom and even empires if you are able to create one. The one thing that I do not enjoy is the fact that you can't have a good multiplayer session due to the fact that the games always desync from the host and its players. I have only finished one game as the Duke of Sjaelland, where i neglected to fight the Mongol horde and ended up losing my seat as the Duke of their and moved on to become a vassal of the Aztec Empire. Definately a thumbs up and sure buy if you are into Grand Strategy.Graphics: 8 - Not much to look at since your normally in map view.Sound: 9 - Great soundtrackGameplay: 9 - Great game, tends to be hard in certain areas and demense sizesStory: 8 - Make your own historical household.

												One of the most enjoyable games I've ever played. The amount of depth is amazing, and the text based build allows for very easy modding. Although some parts of the game may be ahistorical, owing the limitations of the game engine (Namely, the portrayal of Byzantium and the Islamic caliphates as decentralised, essentially feudal realms), there's still much fun to be had. With two years of DLC and patches under it's belt, and a further year (At least) to go, I can only see it getting better.			"

												If you're into medeval-themed games and enjoy strategy, boy is this the game for you.TL;DR Steep learning curve, have a friend / youtuber teach you, wait for the game to be on sale to get all the DLCThis game is incredibly fun, but the steep learning curve turns many people off though. Once you get a used to how the game works though, the possibilites are endless. I strongly recommend having a friend/family member teach you the basics of this game. What's that? You don't have any friends? Well lucky for you, there's a plethera of youtube videos that you can learn from, but it will take more time than being taught by someone in person. One of my favorites is ArumbaAnother thing that may seem ridiculous is the amount of DLC this game has, and that is not entirely incorrect. A lot of DLC is not essential, like the portiat DLC, but it does help with immersion. The essential DLC is just if you want to stay in Europe, but this game does offer playable characters from Iceland to India to the Asian Steppe. If the game is on sale, and you have $50 to spare, buy the complete edition of the game with all the DLCBEFORE BUYING DLC, MAKE SURE YOU READ THEIR DESCRIPTIONEssential DLC:CharlemagneOld GodsWay of LifeRecommended DLC:Merchant RepublicLegacy of RomeRuler DesignerSons of Abraham			"

												If you are looking for a grand strategy game, this is it. I came to this game as a fan of the Total War series, and initially looked upon Crusader Kings II with trepidation. However, I can honestly say that this game more fully scratches the grand strategy itch than any other. A word of warning, however. The learning curve is extremely steep. If you try to jump right in, you will surely drown! That being said, if you can devote the time to learn this game's expansive intracacies (every time I play, I learn more), you will not be disappointed. Who I would recommend this game to: Any strategy gamer that is not satisfied with calling ""Clash of Clans"" or ""DoTa"" a strategy game. If you wish the Civilization series had more depth, or the Total War series more historicity, this game is hands down for you.Who I would NOT recomment this game to: people with low attention spans.For me, hands down the best strategy game I've played in years.

												Do you remember the primitive empire building mechanics in Mount and Blade? Ever feel like they weren't able to cover the real breadth of possible political intrigue? Did you ever think you could have solved a standoff by quietly assassinating a regent, marrying off your sister to a mongolian despot, keeping a rival monarchs heir under lock and key by offering to ""educate"" them before declaring a surprise war or carefully replacing all your precursors council members with men fiercely loyal to yourself? Then step right this way my friend, as Crusader Kings 2 is essentially ALL that and a metric tonne more.On the positive side Crusader Kings 2 is one of those games that benefits from a level of detail that should impress even the most brick-chewing and hardened history buff as the majority of its campaigns are based around the monarchs and clergy of the real middle ages. Paradox has done a laudible job in recreating the insane game of political backsies that these historical figures found themselves living through or dieing in. The fact that it also gives you a quick and easy way to look up more information on particularly interesting characters is a great example of tangential learning used in gaming. Further to this there's a truly dizzying amount of depth to the games mechanics that gives you an idea of just why every ruler had to have a retinue of advisors and counsels to help them manage information and make decisions. The lack of a strong structured narrative also gives the player a lot of freedom in how they tackle problems or exploit oppurtunities. It leads to some rather interesting emergent gameplay scenarios that I suspect people who enjoy the game while love swapping with other players just to compare how they each dealt with unexpected problems.It all adds together to give CS2 a real sense of atmosphere, refreshingly not in the usual ""dark, rainy and miserable"" sense that highly atmospheric games often default to. You end up feeling like a man (or woman) with a bit of power under their belt but an order of magnitude more responsibility than you could possibly have been prepared for.On the other hand...the user interface and tutorial could use a hell of a lot of work. Yes this is fairly par for the course in a Paradox game but it becomes more of a bugbear than usual in CS2 due to the sheer magnitude of information the game is required to communicate to the player.  You open a single figure's profile and you're given their nationality, general skills, specific strengths and weaknesses, religion, marriage/betrothal status, claims to land and title, demense makeup, alliances, honourary titles, family tree, dynastic tree, vassals, retainers, your opinion of them, their opinions of you, their hopes and dreams...AGH! STOP! Look I just want to know who his heirs are so I can kidnap one of them!Compounding this problem is that the number of possible avenues of play is quite large and, while the tutorial does it's level best to introduce us to all of them, it felt like trying to teach the specifics of circuit design to a confused panda: More difficult than nessecary and ultimately kind of pointless. When I sat down to go through the tutorial myself I had already initiated and succesfully resolved two murder plots by the time the game actually introduced me to the plotting and conspiracy system. Yet by the time my neighbours were marching over my home territory and I was running about in a flap trying to route them the game decided that now, after the invasion of my home had already begun, would be a good time to teach me about building static defences...on my island colony several thousand kilometeres away. Thanks CS2, you couldn't have mentioned this whole ""developing technology"" thing a little earlier? Perhaps back before my paper thin walls had been breached by a ballistae?Ultimately though once a player works out the ins and outs of the system, and yes that might take several decades of PHD level research and a small team of interns working around the clock, they'll find themselves immersed in a mechanically deep and highly immersive world that will reward them with... well probbably a poisoned cup of wine carried by your heir apparent but a historically accurate one nonetheless.

Look I just want to know who his heirs are so I can kidnap one of them!Compounding this problem is that the number of possible avenues of play is quite large and, while the tutorial does it's level best to introduce us to all of them, it felt like trying to teach the specifics of circuit design to a confused panda: More difficult than nessecary and ultimately kind of pointless. When I sat down to go through the tutorial myself I had already initiated and succesfully resolved two murder plots by the time the game actually introduced me to the plotting and conspiracy system. Yet by the time my neighbours were marching over my home territory and I was running about in a flap trying to route them the game decided that now, after the invasion of my home had already begun, would be a good time to teach me about building static defences...on my island colony several thousand kilometeres away. Thanks CS2, you couldn't have mentioned this whole ""developing technology"" thing a little earlier? Perhaps back before my paper thin walls had been breached by a ballistae?Ultimately though once a player works out the ins and outs of the system, and yes that might take several decades of PHD level research and a small team of interns working around the clock, they'll find themselves immersed in a mechanically deep and highly immersive world that will reward them with... well probbably a poisoned cup of wine carried by your heir apparent but a historically accurate one nonetheless.

												Crusader kings II is the holy grail of grand strategy games. On the grand scale you control a king and his realm (Or a duke or count if you'd like) and make various decisions to benefit it. On the smaller scale of things, you become entwined in a web of international politics and plots, domestic politics and plots, feudal succession laws and many other things. It's a game where everything in the world actively affects everything else in the world. DLC is not required at all, but it does double up the game size with each DLC, each adding even more replay value to a great game.			"

(BEWARE STEEP LEARNING CURVE)<by this i mean a good 6 hours or so to get the basics. Even after this you are always learning something. would recommend Arumba's CK2 Tutorial Series on youtube. Also great to watch to get an idea of the features in the game and the level of depth involved.Features.Manage your dynasty.Plot to kill other characters in the game. Amusing events and decision based on your characters traits and ambitions(Of which you can manage once you learn the game).Conquer lands for your county/duchy/kingdom/empire.Manage your council and court.And many many moreIf you are still reading now for my reviewI enjoyed 90% of this game, although there are thing's that paradox could have done better such as the warfare,Building management, religion and the whole pope minigame, But this is still a great title and i was very happy with my purchase. I spent hours on hours managing my dynasty,Court and my council. While this was happening i was also plotting against my enemies and even my own subjects in my kingdom/empire who were a troublesome sight to my reign. Also had to help my allies and keep an eye on my dynasty members(sisters/daughters) in particular, who i married off to people in larger empires outside my lands who i had high plans for. Overall this game is outstanding if you enjoy a nice in depth/complex empire and dynsaty management system.			"

												I have enjoyed this game much more than I anticipated. My favorite aspect is the length of time in which to create a lasting ""family dynasty."" Paradox (the game studio) has offered, for better or worse depending, several downloadable content (""DLC""s), not all of which are crucial, but offer different enhancements. ""The Old Gods"", my reason for purchasing this particular DLC, allows the player to begin the game in AD867, instead of AD1066. Crusader Kings II, affectionately knowns as ""CK2"" which ends with the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in AD1435 (I think), has a DLC with allows a ""saved game"" to be exported to another Paradox game, Europa Univeralis IV, or ""EU4."" EU4, which is quite different, allows the CK2 game to continue on past 1435. CK2, has more detail when it comes to creating a family dynasty that lasts through hundreds of years and allows a player to play in a dynastic succession. If you have more questions, please ask!

												Crusader Kings II is one of those glorious sandbox/emergent game play titles where success and failure are two sides of the same coin.  Start with just a county and build a legacy to staggering heights - then watch it come crashing down!  Conquer medieval Europe!  Unite Ireland!  Take back Spain!  Defend Rus from the Golden Horde!Be warned: like Dwarf Fortress, event details take place in your mind's eye.  There are no fancy graphics - just a lovingly detailed map, and units marching across it.  There are no cut scenes - just pop-ups containing a nice bit of art, event details, and your potential responses.It's like The Sims meets Civilization, and it's glorious.			"

												The sheer brutality of ruling Medieval Europe made available to you on your computer. I doubt I will ever have the ""Paragon of Virtue"" trait in any of my games. In order to be a strong leader you have to be smart, keep your vassals happy, forge alliances, make sure your heir is strong and that he inherits all of your holdings. I bought the Charlemagne expansion pack, and I am currently playing Charlemagne.Crusader Kings 2 is an awesome alternate history generator- I was able to marry Gisela into the Byzantine Imperial family (historically the attempt to marry her to Leo, Constantine V's son, did not happen since the contract was broken. In real life she became a nun, and ultimately was the abess of Chelles Abbey), which provided the foundation for a formal alliance with the Byzantium in the game I am playing now. I can't wait to see how history unfolds based on this, and all of the other choices I have made up to now. The only drawback to the game is that it's really hard to play the game ""out of the box"". The tutorial modes are not that great. I had to watch a few videos of gameplay on Youtube, enough to get a basic grasp of the game. I watched these two and went on with my own designs for ruling. This is the better of the two gameplay vids that I watched:

												Played this game alone and I married my cousin. I played multiplayer with my cousin and then married my cousin.10/10 Best cousin marriage simulator. Good for the whole realm.But for real, this game is absolutely incredible. I remember when I first saw this game. It was about three years ago and I totally thought this game looked like an overly complicated piece of junk. And boy, was I half right. After totally brushing off this game I started getting really into Civ V. I really loved how immersive the game was and how it wonderfully wove together culture, technology, and history. Eventually, after 200 hours of gameplay, I grew tired of that game and moved on. I moved on to Warband and played over 200 hours of that wonderful game. Yet I still grew tired of it.So I looked online for more strategy games and I came across this game again. At this point I was desperate for a strategy game that could also immerse me in a beautiful world while also giving me something I would take pride in fighting for. So I gave this game a chance and after 500 hours I am still playing this game. Crusader Kings 2 is an amazing grand strategy game that puts you not only in charge of a realm, but in charge of your family's house.  The goal of the game, if there is one to be found, is to bring as much glory to your realm and family name as you can. This can be attained by many different means and that is one of the things that makes this game great. You are put into a position of power in the Middle Ages and destiny is yours to write. However, this game can throw terrible twists your way. Your great genius leader can be killed in battle leaving your young daughter to take the throne in a world that hates female rulers. Or maybe you will find yourself hoping your King-Jeoffery-of-a-son dies so that way your strong, attractive, and genius son can take the throne. Or my greatest nightmare: You can be playing as an Eastern European nation and the Mongolian Hordes begin to knock on your door. Crusader Kings is one of the greatest games I have every played. It is wildly complex and can take over 50 hours to master. But don't let that stop you from giving this game a try. Because once you get a feel for how the Crusader Kings 2 world works, you can let your ambitions run free and carve out a glorious realm with characters that somehow manage to create a story that seems like it could have happened. 10/10 would have my vassals revolt against my 16 year old female ruler during a Mongolian invasion for Poland so I can inherit France and the HRE again.

												Let me describe how my first Crusader Kings 2 game began and you'll hopefully appreciate the fun that this game can offer:my character was over 60 year old Duke of southern Ireland. I had two sons, eldest of which was to be my successor, but who had such personality quirks that I really didn't think he would be the right heir. I preferred the younger son. So I sent the eldest on the most dangerous assignment I could - collecting taxes and hoped for the best (or worst). At the same time I noticed that I had good relations with France and the king of France happened to have two daughters (princesses) in the ripe age for marriage. I tested my luck and offered to wed the other and my eldest son could wed the other. Luckily the king accepted my proposals and there I was, married to a french princess. Not long after the marriage I decided to start fooling around with the other princess as well, because you can't go wrong with two french princesses and as my son was all the time fetching taxes, you had to give some warmth to the lonely french woman in another country. Not long after I got good (bad) news that my son had been killed on his taxation trip and I managed to get the right son to be my lawful heir. I kept the princesses though to myself naturally. At this point I noticed that the french king had an heir, son of age 8 or so. This wouldn't do because I wanted to get France for me as well so I put some plans into work and decided to assassinate the brat. I went a bit over the top though because I invested so much money into the assassination that it had approximately 300% success rate and indeed, after a while I got notice that he was at the same time thrown from the balcony, put into fire and shot with a crossbow. But if you want to get rid of a french king-to-be you better make it right the first time, can't be too careful!			"

												If games could talk, the stories this one would tell would both revolt you, and enthrall you. Like the time I, as the Emperor of Hispania and King of Aquitaine, Ireland, Brittany, and Wales managed to have brothers in charge of each holy order and also have an anti-pope as a daughter-in-law. Other players can tell you stories just as fantastic, and some can tell you ones that will cause your jaw to physically drop. Now, grab your pen, and go write your stories.			"

												Though there's a bit of a steep learning curve to get into it, this game offers the experience of all the dizzying highs and frustrating lows of hundreds of years of history. Once Crusader Kings gets into your head, its quite difficult to stop playing.No game is better at demonstrating the cause and effect of history, where seemingly casual decisions (oh, I'll give this dukedom to my brother, that will make him happy) come back to haunt you 10, 20, 100 years down the line (when the descendent of your brother use the power of that duchy you gave them to launch a civil war against you). In one game, I converted to the Cathar heresy of Catholicism, which allows women to hold positions on your council and lead armies -- very useful, especially since many women with high stats are not being used by all your other misogynistic rivals. Then a hunchback king ascended to the throne -- and hunchbacks are hideous to the opposite sex, meaning all females hated me. Given that most of my realm was now female nobles and leaders, I found myself in a dilemma of my own making. I screamed. You will scream, and often, expressing a variety of emotions. It's that good. 10/10!			"

												Easily one of the best games I have ever played. I'm going to be honest, if you want your game to be action packed, this is probably not a game for you, as it is a 100% strategic game, especially in Ironman (not cheating, only autosave) mode.I've tried explaining this game to a couple of people and it's just not possible, 'cause there is just so much to it.Not only can you roleplay perfectly in this game, you can raise your Dynasty from the Count of Paris to the King of France, it's all in your hands.It might not be action packed, but trust me, if you are playing as a Count with a 45 year old wife, 0 intrigue (trait for killing people etc.) no children, and thus no heir, you are going to be Game Over.I can't say enough how much enjoyment and pleasure this game will give you if you love medieval, strategic games.There is, however one downside to it, if you buy the game without DLC's you are going to have to pay A LOT of money to really enjoy the game (have the ability to play as Muslims, Jews etc.) There are ofcourse Game + DLC packs available on the internet which will give you enough DLC's to play the game properly. Game is NOT recommend without the mayor DLC's.  "

												Crusader Kings II (CKII) is the most tactical strategy game of all time. From the producers at Paradox, it incorporates a number of features missing from most strategy games, and provides a robust modding experience allowing players to rewrite history on their own terms. As a person who detested Paradox games, I went into CKII expecting to be turned away, but instead, I was sucked in to an intricately unique character development system.Unlike most strategy games focusing on war and city-management, CKII's character development system sets the bar for future grand strategy games. Literally every character in the game has traits. These traits culminate into a character's statistics, and their behavioural A.I. For example, characters with the ambitious trait are aggressive in pursuing actions to further their own personal agenda; however, characters with the content trait tend to be passive. Characters who are lustful pursue multiple relationships, deceitful characters are more driven to betray others.As your nation's leader, you must juggle between these behaviour types, and more, to create a peaceful and large country amongst threats from various warring fronts. You have rebels, political strife, assassinations, the Mongols, the Pope, and simply ill-fated events, such as the plague. Age is also a factor, and as you and your council grow older, your favorite characters are more suspectible to illness, and negative traits, such as being infirm. One day, my talented leader died because his heart wasn't healthy enough for sex. The game is profoundly deep, and you'll feel like it accounts for everything.Speaking of sex, the game dives into very controversial taboos that would make some developers squeamish. There is imprisonment, torture, concubines, bi-sexual relationships, pagan religions, cruelty to children, making someone eunich, and that's just the original CKII content! Intrepid modders have already added slavery, assassinating your own children, and fantasy content, such as Succubi, werewolves, and vampires. The game is what you make of it! CKII also has an ambitious Game of Thrones mod. It includes a customized map, and all the characters from the show with their corresponding behavioural traits, events, and more.CKII is a ground-breaking ambitious title setting the bar for future strategy games. It's character-driven concept is fresh and innovative, and I hope Sega's Total War series embraces some of its ideas.			"

												Crusader Kings II has slowly became my favorite strategy game after many hours of pain and toil I have faced as a new player. This game is brilliantly made with many ins and outs to its gameplay weither you are the Kaiser of the Holy Roman Empire or just a lowely Count. The experience of Ck2 is not made to ease players into the the game, it will take you many tries to begin to understand the game fully...but that is the fun part of it. Ck2 will have you coming back again and again with its DLCs and different senerios, so the replay value of this game is very high. All together my only complaint is the base game paired with the DLCs can be very expensive. Luckily you will find sales on the game paired with the DLCs that make it much more affordable for the casual gamer. This game is not for the casual gamers though, I wouldn't reccomend this game to those who have not played Grand Strategy games before like the Total War series. But for those of you that like this type of gameplay you will love this expansive world of trials, murder, strategy, family values, and utter domination. Crusader Kings II is A truely masterfully made game.Pros:-High Replay Value.-Fun and sometimes hilarious senerios.-Grand scale.-Well made AI system.-Functional multiplayer.-Intresting story lines and challenges.-Complicated Strategy.-Great gameplay.Cons:-High price paired with DLCs.-Some minor glitchs.-Not the easiest tutorials(I feel this can be a plus though because it makes you experience the game through trying it).On a scale of 1 to 100:           95/100			"

												Started as Lesser Poland, intent on forming an empire.I conquered 95% of the land I needed, working on getting a claim for that final province. This province is a holy site needed to reform my pagan faith, so I can push back on the never-ending tide of christianity. The religious fervour eating away at me, I tranformed into a lunatic possessed by the Devil himself.After bearing 28 children, my 3 concubines start conspiring. Unable to cope with my mad, insatiable lust, they fill the basement beneath an inn I happen to be staying in with manure and promptley set fire to it. I and my cohort are blown sky high.In the following succession crisis, Pomerania and Lithuania break free, Poland fragments and I'm left as a single county count with more claims than I can ever pursue, but powerless to press them.Would play again 10/10.

												I can't even describe this gameYou don't buy this game because of its interesting gameplay nor because of the good stuff you've heard about the game. You buy this game for reasons unknown to man (usually because it looks strange and goes on sale once a month) And then you play it for 20 hours and you realize you still don't actually know how to play the game. Then you play 40 hours and you've now gotten the basic grip around the game. 100 hours in and you're going crazy. At this point I might as well die considering I've lived 1000+ virtual lives and ruled half of virtual Europe. There is nothing left for me to accomplish that I wouldn't ♥♥♥♥ up for sure. 9/10 - Don't have more than one son, Don't try and take any part of Scandinavia in the winter (don't ever try actually), try and resist buying dlc, ♥♥♥♥ YOU HOLY ROMAN SHITCUNT♥♥♥♥HEAD NOBODY LIKES THE CATHOLICS ANYWAY :,(			"

												My son married a black princess of Abissinia. When I died, he became emperor. He had a son that was black. In less than 50 years the rulers of the Byzantine Empire were black.			"

												While it's not for everyone, the hours I've sunk into this game are a testament to its quality. While not very graphically impressive, the game makes up for this lack by having highly detailed people and places, and is about as historically accurate as one can get. It's really more of a Dynastic/Kingdom sandbox simulator than a game, and really lets you experience what it would have been like to be Emperor, King, Duke, or Count. Critical thinking, and long term strategy are essential to surviving (even your own children you groom to be your heir may try and murder you if you don't pay attention, or have an inept spymaster.) You're more or less just living a story as you decide to tell it. Playing it like any other game will result in frustration, and the extinction of your house within the first 100 years.			"

												""The king's eyes shot open, but he could not move. There was a hand over his mouth and a dagger above his head.""Crusader Kings II is perhaps the best and the worst. It makes you believe that there is so much more possible out there, and there is! But it's so hard. So, so hard. But it is not a punishing hard but rather a challenging hard. You become more and more invested and you want to complete this challenge given before you. The achievement system does well to provide you the challenges. But at the same time, because it alludes to so much, it's hard. Hard not to imagine that there could be more. With the new conclave (even if you have to pay for that), it does well to expand upon such expectations. Overall, I find this game to be awesome, but because it is so awesome, it fails to deliver in some regards before charging us extra for what should've been already part of the game.			"

												Easily one of the best games I have ever played. I'm going to be honest, if you want your game to be action packed, this is probably not a game for you, as it is a 100% strategic game, especially in Ironman (not cheating, only autosave) mode.I've tried explaining this game to a couple of people and it's just not possible, 'cause there is just so much to it.Not only can you roleplay perfectly in this game, you can raise your Dynasty from the Count of Paris to the King of France, it's all in your hands.It might not be action packed, but trust me, if you are playing as a Count with a 45 year old wife, 0 intrigue (trait for killing people etc.) no children, and thus no heir, you are going to be Game Over.I can't say enough how much enjoyment and pleasure this game will give you if you love medieval, strategic games.There is, however one downside to it, if you buy the game without DLC's you are going to have to pay A LOT of money to really enjoy the game (have the ability to play as Muslims, Jews etc.) There are ofcourse Game + DLC packs available on the internet which will give you enough DLC's to play the game properly. Game is NOT recommend without the mayor DLC's.  "

												I love this game so much. If you like Civ 5, or any of the total war games you will love this game like me. The game takes 24 hours to figure out however. I would recommend getting the Muslim and Byzantine DLCs as well			"

												Very good game, have played it for many hours. The game gets deeper every time you play it. When you think you have figured it out, it gets back at you realise that you suck at this game. Welcome to the world of paradox.			"
