												When I bought the deluxe edition for AS-2, I was paying more not only because I loved the previous games in the franchise, but because I loved what potential AS-1 had presented us with, especially considering the many great mods avalible for the original.  But more than that, I was buying the sequel to one of my favorite games of all time.Needless to say, I haven't been impressed.  In fact, my experience with AS2 has been beyond disappointment.  Given the time from the early beta stage to now, and including the push-back of the release date multiple times, I've found that this game has not only been a waste in terms of what potential it had, but you are literally paying for a $34.00 overhaul patch by buying this game.The biggest improvements since AS-1 have been:1.  Multiplayer, which lags often, and depends on who is better at storming a place with infantry and light vehicles.  Tanks are, very rarely fielded.  The gameplay is repetitive, and balance issues come and go.2.  The Super-Pershing and a few tank models.  Yeah, they look a little more ""smooth,"" but then you can take a peek at everything else.  Everything else is literally recycled from the previous game.3.  Multi-core support.  I haven't noticed a difference.The things I'd thought I was going to see:1.  A little bit of variety in the infantry.  Yeah, they don't even have new models or textures.  It's the exact same thing from the previous title, rehashed a bit for a few more ""Breeds,"" which you can make by simply opening the editor and reassigning a few traits, weapons, and items.  There are a few more voices thrown in for the American and English soldiers, but there is still plentiful cut-and-paste from the previous game.  Oh, and the voice acting is horrific for the most-part.2.  Better textures.  The dirt looks beautiful.  A few tanks look better.  But, for everything else, it all is recycled from the last game.  The buildings aren't different.  The uniforms aren't different.  The mass majority of vehicles aren't different.3.  Better gameplay.  Yeah, no.  In fact, they took away the feature where you could unload your guns.  The AI is a little more ""Cover-seeking,"" so they are no longer inherently stupid.  However, you still have to pack up millions of bullets so they can fend for themselves without running dry.4.  Differences between faction weapons.  I'll admit, I was expecting more realistic performance out of the guns for each faction.  But, all rifles are pretty much the same, the Thompson isn't much different from an MP-40, the Grease-Gun is treated like a 9-mm, and overall, you're just going to go for an MG-42 if you want rate of fire; the browning if you want less reloading; or the BAR/FG-42 if you want less unloading.  There isn't much of an accuracy or damage difference.  Line up soldiers with every faction's rifle; they fire and reload at the exact, same times, with the exception of the enfield rifleman.  There should be a difference.  The action on a Mosin is completely different from a 98' or a Springfield.5.  Models and textures.  Yeah, about 10 vehicles look better.  But the mass majority of the others still look copy/paste.  If I wanted to copy/paste vehicles, I'd make a mod for that.Can I say I recommend this game?  No.  For $34.00, hell no.  It's nowhere near being worth that kind of money, and I'm losing to faith to tell myself that ""yeah, it'll improve as they get closer to the full release.""  It's been in Early Access for quite some time now.  Before that, there was beta.  They have had the time to improve the game.  Yet, I have only seen them trying to get it into a playable state every few weeks, while leaving us high and dry in every other aspect.  Maybe if it were $10.00 DLC for AS1, it'd be worth it.  But as a standalone game, let alone a Sequel, it's not just a cheap re-release with nothing new to offer, but it's a complete waste of money.I've already learned from one other game that pulled the same ""Beta limited-content"" trick.  ArmA 3.  Overall, that game was a complete disappointment.  There was very little content added into the beta, there was very little content added into the main game, and countless patches treated the post-final release like it was (and still is) in the early-access stage.  AS2 is mirroring this tactic, and foreshadows disappointment.I have a feeling they're going to just decide to ""leave it to the modders,"" as ArmA 3 did, and while mods are often well done, they are not only far from uniform in quality and not designed by a common party, but that's a cheap way of copping-out of extensive work.  Work that this game seriously needs if it is to hold the number ""2"" after Assault Squad.A better name for this would be ""Assault Squad: MEGAPATCH.""  If you feel like disagreeing, then pull up the AS1 editor and the AS2 editor.  Put down one of every model.  Test the game, see what happens; you'll learn that I'm right, because this is exactly how I tested it.  I'm not making these claims without evidence.  There is no difference between these games except for the mulitplayer.Do keep in mind; this review is for a $34.00 product.  It is intended to reflect and aid you, the viewer, in determining whether or not you will ""get what you pay for.""  The answer to that is no, ""No, you won't.""I SINCERELY HOPE THAT THE FINAL RELEASE PROVES MY FEARS TO BE WRONG, AND RENDERS THIS REVIEW TO BE OUTDATED.  SHOULD THAT BE THE CASE, I WILL GLADLY CHANGE MY REVIEW AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE GAME.  SHOULD MY FEAR THAT THIS GAME OFFERS NO ""CHANGE"" WORTHY OF A SEQUEL BE CONFIRMED AT FINAL RELEASE, I WILL NO LONGER DO BUSINESS WITH DIGITAL-MIND-SOFT.Do know; I won't be alone in that regard.[July 19, 2014] UPDATE!Ok; so since the game's release, there has been little to nothing improved upon since I had written this review.  The ""priority"" for the team has only been multiplayer.  There has been no increase in content.  There has been no more bang for the buck.  Digital-Mind-Soft has charged their community for a mere patch, and has done nothing to back the quality of the game except tamper with multiplayer mechanics, and not even to the extent that significantly alters gameplay in any way.Do you have money to waste, and want to support a dishonest development project?  Then don't spend money.  Please.Stop giving companies the motivation to screw over their customers and to default on their promises.  It's been months, and there aren't even any new ""Humanskins"" in the game.  Let me say right now:  It takes 10 MINUTES OR LESS TO CREATE A NEW ""SKIN"" USING PAINT.NET.With the time they've taken to add ""boards"" to Multiplayer, I could have created the entire Italian Army with a modeling program; sadly, that's 3DS-MAX, a program that the 2014 edition of, costs upwards of $3,400 to own.[August 26 2014] UPDATE!Playing through the editor a bit, one of the first things I checked were the models.  What can I say about them?  Three new models; all Crusader Tanks.  The model has been significantly improved, with the Crusader looking more streamlined and smooth than before.  It looks good.  Not only that, but there are 2 more Crusaders; a 40mm Anti-Air crusader, and a 20mm Anti-Air crusader.  These, too, look good.  But nonetheless, Japanese vehicles still look as though they are made out of cardboard, and there haven't been any other model updates added.Most importantly, the soldiers still have the same skins as in the previous title; the lack of effort in this category is appaling.  Do bare in mind; Assault Squad was a 2009 game.  This means that the soldier's skins are 5 Years old.  You can learn to create professional 3D models in half that time.  Given that this much time has progressed, one would and should expect more from a company charging full-price for a ""patchwork"" game.			"

												Men of war Assault squad 2 is the sequel to the well received Assault Squad. Even with this being a sequel there are still major and blatant problems with this game.  1st. Lack of new content.  The 1st problem with this game is that there isn't very much new content. For being a sequel you would think there would be. It's more of an over all update to the 1st game. The only thing that the 2nd game added is an updated a game with better optimization, better UI, graphics, sound, and Steam features. There is 15 ""New"" single player ""skirmishes"", plus 25 reworked old ones from the original Assault Squad. Making 40 single player missions. Which isn't very much, especially being 25 old one. Which let me remind you that is ""3"", ""3"" new Missions for each Nations.   Most of the new content that is been added as been added in patches. That were a lot of its coming from. Like health bar, skins, models, sounds, Units and new voices.  2nd. AI  One of the thing you will ran across it the Stupid AI both on the enemies side and your Units. You will be doing a lot of micromanagement, do to the stupidity of your units. A good example would be your medics not picking up your dead men unless told to do so! It's not uncommon to get focus on one part of the battlefield only to come back and see 4-5 men on the ground and your medic sitting there. Making you to manually to him to get each one.   Amour showing their ♥♥♥ and side to the enemy or just refusing to turn their front to the enemy. If you know anything about tanks or amour, you would know that the thickest amour is in the front. Well someone didn't tell your troops. Because 1 too many time have I had to take over control of a tank or Amour car and position it the right way.  Sniper will sit there a lot even though they have clear shot on enemy troops. So many times I've had to click on enemy troops to get my snipers to pick off targets. AT (Anti Tank) troops will ran across an open battlefield to shot a tank point blank range. When  I've be able to take control and do from half of the Range. I've literally watch Panzerschreck troops ran straight to a tank and get killed, and if that is no enough a lot of the times, they will just stare at it from a far while it kills all his comrades! Even better is when they're right next to it, get killed, and didn't even fire a shot.   With this Friendly and enemy troops won't even fire at one another even when theres a tank troop right on the other side of the dead tank. They will both sit there.   Enemy troops will hide and sit there when to many casualties are taken, instead of running, and regrouping. You are now force to ran to the 1 or 2 enemy solders and completely annihilate them with a full squad. If not? You can ignore them and continue your advance to the next objective!  So let me set this up for you. The enemy is pushing on one side of the map hard, with Infantry, Tanks, and an armored car. You get caught up in this side of the map tiring to stop this advance. You are slugging it out knocking out tanks and shooting down Infantry, making sure your troops are fighting right, and micromanagement them so do not lose this side of the battlefield. Making sure your Panzerschreck troops are firing (Or even just taking control your self...) medics are get the dying up, and that your troops are picking the right targets.   Only to win that fight, go to look at the other side of the battlefield and see that your man have been annihilate because your medic didn't pick up the dead, your AT troops sat there, etc... This is a very small list of some the stupid this that the AI does. I could go on picking out all the stupid drown right unbelievable things the AI will do. You literally need to micromanagement most if not all your troops.  3rd. A lack of total content.  Lest be honest here. It is not skirmish, these are single player Missions/campaigns. If you played a RTS before you most likely played one with a skirmish mode which is AI vs you and Ally AI on a map with some object or just to kill the other side. This is a major problem do to the fact that those 40 missions get old fast. Since 1st 25 of then are old one from AS1, 2nd after you complete them there isn't any thing to do after but to replay them over and over again. And most of the missions are just a Assault on key objective over and over again just on a different map. Some of the New missions are defensive mission or Sniper missions.   If you wanted new content you're ♥♥♥♥ed. There is 2 way to go. Go to the work shop and download user made missions or learn to use the Editor. Which is ridiculous!  1st The editor isn't easy enough for the average player to make new content for themselves. It isn't easy enough to even to make simple battles, let a lone missions. There isn't any Tutorials to help you except for one guy on YouTube, but he doesn't tell enough for how to make a mission or even a good battle. All these Epic battles on YouTube are just some guy placing random Units on each side, and having then ball up in  an orgy in middle of the map and just kill. As if they weren't even train as soldiers. Taking no cover, nothing just kill, kill, kill. I hear from the New patch that just came out, that DLC is on the way which in true is another sad joke, because now they're going to sell you new content that should of been in the game in the 1st place. IMHO they need to make a FREE DLC, that adds 10 new missions for each faction, then I can walk a way content. Because even with that, that still wouldn't be enough for a game that $35. Do to the fact that it has very low replay value. In my honest opinion they really should of been 25- 30 new mission and the 25 old ones as Thank you to the fans. Then I could of walk away happy, but still disappointed in no Real skirmish mode.  When it comes to the DLC, most likely it will be a couple of new missions, and a Couple of new multiplayer maps. Which should of been in the in the 1st place. 5 missions for $5 which is a such a bad joke it's unbelievable. What they need to do is Add new Nations, with Missions and New units equipment, etc. Like Italy, which was talked about on the Steam Community Hub forums, and is a great Idea. Why not do a Axis minors pack with Hungary and Romania , or even a Allies Minor pack? Poland would be a Great one too, or even France. With this then you can do Missions pack with 20-30 or so missions. Or even just expansion to the already existing nations, with New units, equipment, missions, etc.  With all of this, It seems like this game was made for multiplayer, yet the multiplayer is dead. Yet It was the same way with AS1. The most I've seen is about 8-10 lobbies at prime times. Even if you were to play multiplayer, you would most likely get your ♥♥♥ kick by a veteran of the games Anyway.   4th. The verdict  The problem is that they made this really great RTS, (one of the best I've played) but doesn't have any content in it. Out of all the RTS games I've played, this one has the lest amount of content. And I've played them all, I've played Command & Conquer, Age of Empires, Company of Heroes, Empire Earth, Total War, Star Wars Empire At War, Dawn of War, World In Conflict, StarCraft, and many more I can't think of right now. The Biggest problem is that I feel that they just made the tools for you make your own content. As if they made AI, the Units, UI, etc, and just sold you the tools to make your own game, and made a some missions as examples. Would I recommend this game? I would say No. Because even though it's a great game, with the lack of content and the Good but over just an update to the 1st AS there isn't much here. It being 6 month since release, they could still save this game, with a FREE DLC Mission pack, ( With more then just 1 missions for each Nations!!!!) and some new Nations DLCs. But the big problem will still be the replay value, do to no real skirmish mode. "

Early Access Review
								Since I have been lucky enough to acquire early acess to the Beta of it and have logged over 200 hours on the 1st Assault Squad I figure ive earned some right to comment on this upcoming release. I have to say that I am having very few graphical issues, only one instance where i can remember a serious shader error but it was easily fixed by minimizing the game and re opening it. The graphics do look very nice and there are several small details i appreciate like the ejecting shell and the smoke from the breech of the cannon and other small things that added to the whole. The gameplay is just as good as the first Assault Squad and ive played 3 matches so far and 2 of them had good frame rates and all while one was bad but hey 2:3 isnt to bad especially for pre-release. There is still the fun 3rd person mode and all the other things that make men of war the amazing RTS it is. I would certinly reccomend this game to any fan of the men of war series and really to anyone who enjoys RTS's or stratagy games in general.			"

												While the difference in this game compared to The previous assault squad is minimal, there are a few key differences that does improve the game. The graphics and animations have been slightly improved along with a few minor unit improvements.The one big reason I purchased this game is due to the fact that there is now the steam workshop added for the game, there are a lot of decent mods and maps/missions that make the game enjoyable if you dont fancy multiplayer. I cant comment too much on multiplayer as I never got into it.Overall though the game can be enjoyable if you liked previous verisons of the game or are a fan of RTS WW2 games.			"

												Edit, while the out of sync error has been corrected, I still feel the game is too lacking to deserve a positive review. I'm an avid fan of the Men of War series, Assault Squad 1 being my most played, I feel I've gotten my worth of single player content out of it but when it comes to multiplayer, it simply does not cut it, the ""Out of Sync"" error has been going on for far too long and for this, I cannot recommend it until it is fixed. Unless you plan of doing single player only. (Trust me, there's plenty of mods and missions to make it worth it in at least that regard.)Another thing that should be mentioned is the missions are pretty much copies of each other, for the most part, the mission concept is the same for all nations.

												It is only when you watch one GI in a jeep stare at another, it's metalwork pinging from the sounds of .50 cals, the engine block busted and on fire, the jeep itself totally surrounded by German soldiers, only for seconds later both of them to casually get out of the jeep, on fire, and run screaming from it into the street only to fall dead on the sidewalk that you will realize that this game is possibly the most insane piece of programming ever put to sale.You will also realize however that its god damn brillant.

												pros:-very good infantry combat-the best tank combat in an rts game ever-rewards your strategic planning/flanks with letting your enemy be demolished by said strategic actions-overall quite active playerbase. (don't except 100k people it's a ww2 rts)-exceptional graphics. especially buildings/nature/vehicles-good guides/tutorials (they are in the main menu)-all infantry have their own names and inventory. so do tanks. infantry can run out of ammo as well as tanks can run out of fuel-live out your fantasies as a ww2 major-up to 8v8. a total of 16 players. prepare for ultimate lag while playing with 15 other people.-LOTS of mods-very very fun with friends-very well optimized. can run on a potatocons:-1/4 of the playerbase actually plays on potatos-when someone has bad performance, ping/bad computer, everyone suffers with a VERY laggy game-♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice acting that i always turn off-infantry animations are not as polished as games like CoH2-sort of steep learning curve. if you're not new to rts games and are coming from something like coh, you will get used to it within 10~ hours of playtime-if you are completely new to rts games prepare to hate the game for your first 30 hours-LAGGGGG(i recommend to kick people with ping higher than an average of 300 and have less than two performance bars. If they have full red bars boot them immediatelybut besides all of that, it's The best WW2 RTS one could ever play Men of War: Assault Squad 2 (specifically RobZ mod) does things most other rts games don't do.It throws balance out the ♥♥♥♥ing window and makes it historically accurate.  Tank combat is the best I've seen in any RTS games. (IT EVEN FACTORS IN ANGLING WOWWWW). Things like supporting your tanks with infantry and flanking play very important roles. Moreso than games like CoH2. Infantry firefights can be over in an instant, or take a looong while till anyone starts dying. It depends on how you use cover.Everything also feels right.MG-42s cut down infantry.Jumbo Shermans take 88mm no problem.KV-2 blows off enemy turrets like a boss.This game requires a lot of micro, however with common sense you'll be just fine. Before you make a risky move, ask yourself this:If I do this in real life, will myself, my vehicle, or my men be blown to bits?If yes, take another aproach to your conundrum.Anyway, if you like hardcore RTS games then this will be amazing for you. tl;dr best ww2 rts ever.

												After a year I think it's time for me to write a review about this game, what to say really? how the mighty have fallen one could say from the excellent Assault Squad 1 in 2011 to this. I'm just gonna list the changes that weren't in AS1 and the things left unresolved.Pros:-Steam integration and Steam workshop-New player logs and info tracking-New skirmishes and new types of skirmish-Camo changes according to the season of the battle is taking place in-8-10 new online maps-Auto ammo resupply Cons and this is gonna be a long list:-Horrible optimization and performance issues-Bollocked up netcode-If there's one player with a bad PC everyone lags-AI still bollocked up-New multiplayer maps are half-♥♥♥♥♥ unfit for competitive play-Terrible voice acting-Paid for replay and bots DLC-No actual gameplay improvement or changes from AS1-One new unit for UK and Germany-Rehashed maps from AS1-No R6 map pack integration-Suffered from a prolonged period of OOS that made the game broken and unplayable online and still don't know if it's truly resolved?-Extreme Assault Zones-Needless ""units locked by level""-Decreased gun ranges-Did I say lag? well it should be here twice -Balancing issues-Some units are useless-Infantry models still look the same The developers actions against the community in the past few days were the last straw for me, banning on the forums for speaking or complaining against the game, censoring my friend strat's preview videos of Call to Arms.I had faith and patience in this studio but I lost both, and no longer looking forward for any new releases by them, Assault Squad 1 was the big dog's biscuit, I had over 1k hours of gameplay on steam and over 1.5k on gameranger.Truly breaks my heart to see its sequel in this state like there were no love or effort put into its creation.

												Edit #2: Review update: 05/29/2015Sadly no improvment for this game: OOS (out of sync) since the last major update alongside with constant freezes in MP which DMS can not fix resulted in a more or less complet dead game. Most players have already shelfved it or moved over to BoE although it has the old MoW look but at leas ti runs smooth. Edit: Review update: 11/19/2014More than half a year later DMS managed somehow to improve the performance marginally. 2vs2 is now possible but with more players you still face lag and drops. 4vs4 is still unplayable and the long time ago promised 8vs8 has never been delivered. Gameplaywise it is the still the same arcadish spam and clickfest on tiny maps  although the dedicated community has made a lot of suggestions how to improve it at least a bit. So far DMS decided not to listen to the community and treat the rest of its loyal fan base with ignorance. Slightest critisism result in bans and locked threads. Rumors say DMS treats its employees in a similar way, would at least explain why they fail to fix their game. DMS also has decided to sell the replay feature as paied DLC as it is ""new"" for them while it is for  other games an included  basic feature. So far  all arguments form the old review are sadly still vaild.If you really look for a WW 2 themed game, grap CoH. It runs better , it looks better and it is just a bit more arcadish than AS 2. If you look for a realistic WW 2 go for Graviteam Tactics or the good old Blitzkrieg. In the end AS 2 is not even worth the 5 bugs when it is on sale especially with DMS's questionable behaviour._______________________________________________________________________________-Review 6/11/2014As a long time player and supporter of DMS and the Mow series, I sadly have to say that  AS 2 is a big fail at its current state. The game has a lots of serious issues and it looks like  that DMS is not willing to fix their game or they  just can not.It seems AS 2 is more  a desperate attempt by DMS to grap some players form its rivial COH  and milk a bit the small loyal players with the result that the series was dumped down pretty hard.AS 2 is in general a  copie of AS 1(same units same models) with  the diffrence that AS 1 works. The game engine has been updated so the game looks a bit more polished than AS 1 but now  it tends to lag as hell. Currently it is not even  possible to play 2vs2 lag free or without freezes. Matches with higher playercount (4vs4 max!) are more or less impossible as the players drop like flies due to heavy lag caused by the poor net code and/or engine. Besides the technical issues the gameplay suffers also a lot from some designe decisions. In AS 1 it was possible to have a nice tank fight or the chance to flank your enemy. This does not work in AS 2 due to tiny maps and ridiculus ranges for tanks. The current gameplay is only focused on spamming wave after wave of infantry. Tanks or emplacements like at guns are not really needed. The entire gameplay feels artificially  pressed in tiny maps  to create a CoH feeling. In additon DMS has also forgotten or did not want to fix existing problems like the strange pathfinding of  the units or the overcomplicated resupply system.DMS has also introduced an unlock system for new players to getting them used to the units . Sadly this creates more fustration as locked units for all factions seem to have been picked randomly and creates very unfair games especially in matchmaking. But in general this  does not matter as the Matchmaking system does not work properly as well. Tutorials, or a real Skirmish (not the repetitiv SP Missions which they call Skirmish) would have been more helpful for newcomers as the game still explains nothing. It is even hard to say how many people play the game as there is no lobby anymore, only the steamchat which is pretty empty. Also the server browser is bugged as it only shows max 50 servers, most of them skirmish servers so not sure how many try to play MP.DMS had a lot of time to get their act together. Closed beta for CtA backers (what i did), open beta, delay of the release as the game did not run but was surprisingly  ready for preordering, another dealy of the release and the unannouced move to Early Access without any compensation and several post release patches  should have been enough time to create a game  which offers a kind of enjoyment. The only good thing is the steamworkshop where really dedicated and talented modders can present their creations.As for now the game can not be recommanded, even it would be on a steam sale.			"

More than 1000 hours! That should be enough as a proof of Love.Pro: very many ways in the editor. Yes builds itself your own small or large Scenario.With the right mods you have a huge selection of Units: for example: Hungary, Romania, Italy, etc.Plays orginal faithful models of Tanks. Uniforms, Faces, Names, Weapons , Sounds, Textures  and Inventory and more can be adapted to your own choice.Make your own maps / mods and upload them.The community is great and nice. People here like to present you answer every question.The Workshop will provide you a lot of material like: maps, mods, unitsNegative: It eats my life. The Woman screams and wants more time with me. Map/Mission Projecte can end in a lot of work and time.Check it out yourself in! I highly recommend it !!! "

												Would be one of the best WW2 RTS games ever created. BUT... ..there is a known, unfixable (so far) fault, a fault since release last year, a fault that has taken nearly 12 months to still not fix, a fault that the dev/devs claim to be working on, a fault that crashes multiplayer games, a fault that they did not bother to fix as they were busy creating DLC to get more money, About 50% of games (or more) will crash after a random amount of time.  They say to switch off Steam Overlay, we did, it makes no difference. Plus why should we switch off Steam Overlay, I thought it was a requirement for a Steam game to be compatible with Steam overlay. They said not to play with any mods, We did, we removed all mods, it still crashes.This is not just me, please google 'Men of War Assault Squad 2 Out of Sync errors' and see the rage for yourself. Do not bother buying unless you like wasting 2 hours of your life at a time just to get a frozen screen or error and crash. Game in it's current state is not worth playing even if it was free.			"

												I have been a Assualt Squad junkie since the day the newborn child was bought from you. I cannot guess how many hours I have played as well as my older son who kicks my butt every time.However, I have the Modern AS, but Men of War is by far my favorite and most peoples from what I see in the forum. Wouldnt it be prudent to constanly release updated missions for this game, like every quarter or something? I know I would buy them all and am sure most of your dedicated followers would too. However I again cannot thank you for this unbelievable experience you created that has thrilled me all these many years.Cheers, Tom.			"

												Men of War Out of Sync Squad 2I honestly never thought I would be giving a men of war game a bad review, but the state of this game is absolutely pathetic. I have been following this series since the original MoW. I have poured over 1200 hours in the orginal game, MoW assault squad1, and this game as well. I have played almost every mission, fought on every multiplayer mode, and have enjoyed both multiplayer and singleplayer modifications. However I can honestly say that this game in the series is a disgrace. It's been over a year since release and yet in every single game I have played in the past few days online I have or had one of my teammates/enemies drop because of out of sync issues. This game should have never been released and instead the already built upon multiplayer system of AS1 should have been expanded into steam instead of milking out money from the followers of this series by releasing this garbage. I hope that the developers find it in their time to salvage whats left of this broken game and it's disheartened community instead of releasing more DLC's or call to arms. However looking back at the past year and seeing the lack of stability I highly doubt that the multiplayer will be in any working condition anytime soon. If you are interested in this game do not buy it, wait until you hear word about the multiplayer being in a stable condition or try out the original MoW as it has a lot of fun singleplayer content through mods and its orginal missions.

												Good game, but poor development team.Another one of those games that seems to fall behind the category of potential ruined by a developer. These guys are very loose in their communication, and their responses on their forums tend to be unprofessional and hostile towards criticism. There appears to be no plan, and they just sort of wing whatever they want into the game. Which is unfortunate, because this is actually an entertaining RTS game.The straw that broke the camel's back for me was they put AI (bots) for multiplayer skirmishes behind a paywall DLC. That is absolutely absurd, and I believe goes on record as the first RTS game to EVER do that in the history of RTS games. AI skirmishes is something that practically every RTS game offers, I mean Starcraft 1 and the first Command & Conquer had AI skirmishes in the base game. This game did not, and then they finally add it, BEHIND a paywall. Absolutely absurd.An official developer's response on the matter:""if you do not want it don't buy it.""Well firstly Mr Smarty Pants, I do want it; good job reading the OP's post, because we are ticked because we do want it, and you decided to paywall a basic feature. However I won't buy it with that unprofessional attitude. Since my money isn't something you seem to want, then I will keep it to invest in a better product. I am going to say that I am pretty appalled by this move, this is honestly the first RTS I seen put AI skirmishes behind a paywall. You should really be ashamed of yourselves.What is gaming coming to when basic features are put behind paywalls? What next, will I have to pay for access to graphics options too? If they decide to rectify this then I will flop this review, otherwise no. Sorry MoW, I like this series, but this just blew your standing with me and a lot of others.			"

I waited more than one year before reviewing this game, as a sign of respect for its developers and to try write a complete and honest review.  Now I think I gave them enough time to fix their game and to prove they care about their costumers, and I'am sorry but they failed...What to say ?  AS2 and its developers for me in 3 words ?  .. A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT !On AS1 I had lot of hours of fun, even if to be sincere 95% of my hours on AS1 were spent with the German Soldiers Mod, a realism mod, so I give credits to DMS for making the basic game (wich is a modified version of the originall MoW by Best Way) but if was not for Blubork's GSM and all the MoW modders, I'am not sure about how many hours I could have on AS1.So in general from MOW to AS1 for me nothing big changed (not that other MOW titles brought bigger changes) if not improved graphic and other little details, main improvements arrived thanks to the evolving of the German Soldiers Mod and other mods, but all in all I was happy with the AS1 platform, they even released free updates with new models, and from time to time I could have fun with the vanilla game too, even if nothing serious.Main problems of AS1 vanilla for me were the artificial weapon datas and in general the lack of realism, not that MoW was realistic, for example regarding ranges AS1 was a step forward, but with AS1 in my opinion the gameplay went even more fast paced and more CoH oriented. I always disagreed with the payback mechanic introduced by DMS, I find that rewarding a player for wasting units doesn't fit the Real-Time-STRATEGY genre, to help new players you need to make in game tutorials (still absent in AS2).So when AS2 was announced I went on AS2 forum and asked personally to devs if AS2 was going to be a more realism oriented game, not a sim, just more realistic, and they put there the fact that they were going to implement realistic weapon datas, I also asked them if they were planning to implement a territory mode like I suggested in the past and again they answered me that something was coming to satisfy this suggestion too.So as I'am a positive person and I like to help who deserve it, I was super happy and I decided to help in the funding of their future CTA title too, even if I was not really interested in a post WWII era MoW.Then the big day to try AS2 arrived......and this sadly was my first reaction after trying it (was obviously in italian but I'll try to translate it:) )""What the ♥♥♥♥ ?? are you kidding me ?!""Yes, it can sound rude but this sincerely was my reaction when trying AS2 for the first time.Performances were terrible (but it was beta so at that time I still had hope here), improvements compared to AS1 ? little to nothing , and it not ends here....Ranges were reduced and the gameplay was damn fast paced, maps had a terrible artificial arena look and were damn small, nothing  like my suggested territory mode,  instead an extreme battle zone mode that had nothing to do with what I suggested, even the realistic weapon datas were not that realistic as the Tiger tank could ""360 non scope"" in one second with its famously and historically known SLOW turret traverse.Regarding the vanilla game a total disappointment, however the full steam implementation was a nice thing and my thought was that performances could improve as promised and once GSM was released then I could just play that and avoid the CoH like vanilla gameplay, even if having to always rely on mods to enjoy a game to be sincere is quite annoying.No less I even created an AS2 thread on the most famous Italian tech forum, I was still supporting the devs despite the problems and failed expectations.After months of waiting I realized I passed more time on the AS2 hub than in game as the game performances were terrible and the vanilla game gameplay a total rush and grenade spam that I was unable to enjoy.Again, I tried to stay positive and give my best to stay present on the AS2 hub and give suggestions, I invested my precious time there but what I discovered was just that, even with their community the Devs were doing a terrible job, threads locked, people banned, not a sign of listening to player suggestions, even Devs replying to suggestions in a quite arrogant way or over-defending their product and ""vision"" at all costs, making you feel like a ♥♥♥♥ and totally impotent toward the series future.I was speechless, I was no more able to recognize the devs I used to like and I helped by being backer and always preordering their products.At same time of this hard blow by AS2 devs, on the other hand, I had Arma 3 devs with their feedback tracker and a forum that is more like a virtual office, where players and devs collaborate to make a better game.And Arma series too started small and niche, for A3 they kept on the realism way so one can think they sold less compared to the more arcade AS2 that tried to follow the mainstream arcade way, but no, this is an outdated way of thinking IMO, now in 2015 you sell more if you make a quality product and you stay HONEST and HELP/ LISTEN to PEOPLE, that's what matter to make an healthy game and business, we are no more in the 20th century, I like to think that people evolved and started punishing the soulless greedy business. look at the paid mod for Skyrim, people must be heard or they revolt.Back to AS2, last but not least disappointment, that ultimately made me quit with the game in December 2014, was that basically if the AS2 vanilla game already had problems in MP, Big mods then were totally unplayable, just crashes, desync and horrible performances, mods that were able to run fine on MoW, now on AS2 years later were unplayable.The OOS issue made us crash 75% of the times in games bigger than 2v2.Basically the only thing that right now work in AS2 is the SP or MP below 2v2 (if both players have a great PC).But if you want to play SP then what's the point of getting AS2 ? yes thanks to workshop you find mods easily but for SP AS1/MOW are good enough and still have SP mods putting there new stuff for free, right now I can't find any good reason to suggest you AS2, specially with this dev behaviour toward their customers.Positive things yes, the auto resupply, veterancy and like I said workshop, but is it enough ? I let you judge on this.Luckily the MOW series is not dead, now we have Battle of Empires that is very promising and where Devs really listen to their community as well as the future Best Way game ""outfront"" on the new engine, in the hope they will not commit same DMS mistakes, like developing two games at the same time as an indie company with low budget ?! I would say maybe better to concentrate your effort to one game per time and listening to your community, or not ? AS2 in the end proved to be a mere way to fund CTA.This MoW series has an huge potential to become the best RTS ever and an awesome sandbox platform, for now to be sincere all MoW developers failed to unleash its full potential and make it a really successful game that, like Arma III in the Tactical-FPS genre, can become a milestone of its genre and make PC gamers proud of it.Let's see what the future will reserve to us MoW players. I know some things are going behind the scene that may surprise us in the future of this series,I'am not going to talk about them right now, but I'am positive :) godspeedPS: my 400+ hours are mostly beta testing GSM, all time wasted as GSM is a MP mod and it wont work on AS2 : )  (even if according to Devs and workshop there is mod support)So I even went ""light"" on this review, I could write worst, but unlike DMS I'am a gentleman.cheersHaZZarD			"

Men of War: Assauld Squad 2 Review - Rating: 8.5/10General ImpressionMen of War: Assault Squad 2 is a nice strategy game. The graphics are nice, everything looks more realistic, compared to the older Men of War games, and also the textures have been improved. The graphics have also been slightly improved from Men of War: Assault Squad. The atmosphere mostly happens in open fields, villages, cities, forests, and even other environments. The audio is pretty nice. I like the sound of the guns, tanks, etc. The music is nice, the ambient music turns into combat music well-synchronized, and it’s overall sounding nice. It sounds less patriotic than the older Men of War titles, but I guess times have changed. The voice acting is also pretty nice. The gameplay is complex, in each mission you have to accomplish some tasks, alike killing certain enemies, cleaning fields off enemies, destroying some units, reaching a point, capturing a point, holding off certain positions, etc. The story focuses on the Soviet, German, American, British and Japan forces during World War 2. The game has 6 campaign, the 6th one of them being the bonus missions. Compared to Men of War: Assault Squad, this game has brought us several types of new missions. That’s a thing I like. But a thing which I don’t like, which is pretty bad: most of the missions have been reposted from Men of War: Assault Squad. This proves that the developers might have worked more on other features, instead of new missions, which disappoints me, because new missions are always an important feature. The mission which have been reposted are also pretty repetitive. The cut scenes of the missions are also pretty nice. The user interface is well-optimized, with no bugs and well-synthetized information. I also like the overall design of it. The controls are pretty good, except with 1 thing: the rotations’ controls of the cameras. I highly recommend you to reset them with the arrow buttons. The engines, just like in every Men of War game, are not perfect. The game has rarely crashes, and when it crashes, you obviously lose the progress of your mission. Try and save the game as often as you can, in order to avoid too much progress lose. You don't want to waste your time by restarting the mission from zero, right? The mechanics are sophisticated, being pretty nice and everything moves well-optimized. Now, I’m going to talk a little about the G.E.M. editor. Just like in every Men of War game, you have a G.E.M. editor. You can create your own battles in it. It is complex and with a various number of functions. This game has brought it more forces from the Earth, more units per each country and overall you will have more diversified fun. I can’t talk about the DLCs of this game, but a friend of mine told me that they contain missions. If you are looking for more content, I’d highly recommend you to purchase the DLCs as well. He also said they are better than the vanilla ones. This game also brings in a new implemented Steam feature, the Steam Workshop. At the workshop, you will find a lot of community-made content, including maps, missions, mods and replays. You can upload your content there, making the community happier, and you can also download content made by other users, to add more content to the game. I have tried the multiplayer, it is still alive and you should try it. There are 5 types of gameplays, a bunch of maps to choose from, and many servers/players. Overall, this is a nice strategy game which simulates the battles of the Soviet, German, American, British and Japan forces during World War 2, but however, has many reposted missions from the original Men of War: Assault Squad, which is a disappointment. Even with this disappointment, I still recommend this game if you are looking for slightly improved graphics, slightly improved AI, and the new missions available.Positive PointsNice and well-designed graphics and texturesPretty nice audio and nice musicFun and challenging gameplayMany missions throughout the 6 campaigns availableInfantry, heavy guns, batteries, cannons, vehicles, tanks, airplanes, and many other units available4 difficulties available (the heroic difficulty is new into the Men of War series)A pretty nice designed user interface, and some well-designed cut scenesSome pretty stable enginesSome pretty nice mechanicsNice DLCs, very rich Steam Workshop and a well-made multiplayer, which is still aliveNeutral PointsThe heroic difficulty should be easier, it is almost unplayableNegative PointsThe new types of missions are repetitiveThis game literally copies most of the Men of War: Assault Squad’s 1 missions, which is a big disadvantageThere are some rare crashes, like in all the Men of War games "

												This is the king of WWII RTS. The way the weapons work, the ability to take command of your troops and the attention to the details for the weapon characteristics blow games like Company of Heros out of the water. The only real failure was the early optimization (fixed since) and the graphics. The textures of the troops leaves something to be desired. I love this game and I think you will too. 9/10			"

												This is my review of Men of War: Assault Squad. I mean Assault Squad 2. Same game, really.I bought the same f**king game twice. The same missions, the same troops, the same skins, even the same animations between troops.(all riflemen have the same animation no matter the weapon, all smg, ect ect.) What little HAS been changed, isn't worth $35. Not by a long shot. Some say that what was added couldn't simply be patched into the first game. Well fine, but offer me a whole new game for that price. They didn't. It's the same f**king game. Some say that you can download a lot of mods from the Steam Workshop. Fine, but admit that the dev's chose that as the easy way out, instead of actually taking the time to make a Single. New. Mission. They expect you to pay thirty f**king five f**king dollars for an hour's worth of work done to the same f**king game. F**k you.This concludes my review of Men of War: Assault Squad. I mean Assault Squad 2.Let me amend this to also state that I am not ""Not Recommending"" this game. It is, in and of itself, a remarkable game. If you plan to buy this one, go right ahead. It is still a great game if you're a fan of the genre. But if you already own the first one, you need not bother.			"

												Men of War - Assault Squad 2,Is a bit of a strange release, because the content is almost 100% the same as Men of War - Assault Squad 1. The gameplay is the same and the only thing that changed are some weapon configurations and range settings. Everything else's basically the same.As a plus though, Men of War - Assault Squad 2 has Steam integration, something Men of War - Assault Squad 1 lacks and thus is unplayable in normal multiplayer matches due to the fact that Game Spy shut down. (You can still play multiplayer by using a program like: Hamachi, Tunggle or Game Ranger)The most important changes, however, are not with actual gameplay, but with the engine that's being used and it's probably their engine of choice for the next game: ""Call to Arms"".Final verdict:It's hard to tell if you should buy Men of War - Assault Squad 2 or the prequel Men of War - Assault Squad 1.If money is an issue, then go for Men of War - Assault Squad 1. Otherwise you should go for Men of War - Assault Squad 2, because it features Steam Workshop & match making and runs on a more modern engine tuned towards high end systems.			"

												Men of War: Assault Squad 2 suffers from being a small step forwards from the first. If you haven't played the first of the Assualt Squads I have no hesitation recommending this for purchase if you have an interest in a deep WW2 real time strategy. Particularly if you played the earlier MoW and want a bit more then you won't be disappointed.For those that haven't played any of the series MoW is an extremely deep RTS, each of your units has an inventory containing their weapons, ammo and equipment (including hat). Each of these units can also be controlled directly by you at any moment. This makes for glorious moments where you crawl a single man with TNT up behind a enemy Tiger and blow it to kingdom come, or your single tank goes on a rampage causing chaos everywhere. In addition to inventories and direct control there are a bunch of game mechanics to consider, the cover system and terrain is essential to keeping the squishy bits on the inside of your man shaped meat sacks. The ballistics and penetration mechanics are supremely important to tanks, angle your armour and more shots will bounce, shoot through buildings and your rounds will lose kinetic energy. Oh and you can destroy pretty much any structure if you fancy it.The problem arises when contemplating a step up from the first Assault Squad. At first glance it doesn't appear like there is that much of a difference, it looks and plays very much like the first one with a few interface tweaks and improved graphics. Many of the improvements over the first are ""behind the scenes"" such as improved kill count mechanics and multiplayer functionality. The major game changer is the steam integration, massively increasing the availability of content and (most of the time) the ease with which you can play it. Sure the quality of a scenario or map will vary but there are good ones out there and reviews and comments make it reasonably easy to find them. The new content is solid if a bit uninspiring, but new units and fixes are being dripfed into the game and what was a bit of a disappointing release in the beginning is getting nicely rounded out. So if you can get this at a discount then do it and check out the workshop, if you want a first time foray into the series then this is the one to get, the depth of the MoW series can not be oversold and when you get it, it is a thing of beauty. It should probably be mentioned most of my experiences are through co-op to give some kind of perspective. PvP is tense, painful, frustrating and beautifully rewarding in equal measure.Just keep stealing hats and MGs and don't mention the voice acting.			"

Early Access Review
								Assault Squad 2, the true successor to the amazing first title, is the embodiment of a true WW2 RTS. The in depth armour system and weapon mechanics are complimented by fantastic graphics that are pleasing to the eye as well as improved UI from the previous Assault squad title. Although the current beta is a bit chunky i have the utmost faith in the developers at Digital Mindsoft to continue the fantastic legacy brought by the first title. The gameplay is in-depth, the setting and units accurate, the gradual increase to the scale of warfare presented in a skirmish or Multiplayer competitive matchup is a welcome test of one’s foresight and planning as more often than not the crucial moment of victory will not come in one distinct period of the game. The ability of this game to allow a player to exploit an opponent’s flaws in defence or his ability to capitalise on his own armoured or support advantage is astounding. A player may use a series of approaches to try and obtain victory, and the games can end up insanely close as players scramble and crawl their way to victory. Nothing beats the feeling of outwitting your opponents and somehow pulling a victory out of thin air.If you seek a game that compares to company of heroes you must look elsewhere as both titles have their own distinct style of gameplay. If you want an in-depth somewhat realistic WW2 RTS with stunning gameplay, good graphics and a stellar community look no further. All elements of the game compliment your experience to make for one of the best, if not the best WW2 RTS games in today’s market, and i hope that if you choose to purchase this title, that you will enjoy it as much as i have.

Early Access Review
								To be quite honest, I'm rather disappointed in this game for one really big reason: it's more or less the same as MoW: Assault Squad (#1).  The compaign can get quite tedius and repetitious (since several maps are repeated with different plants and weather conditions) or it's the same couple of mission sets.  While the game itself is well rounded, the developers failed to address the issues that arose in the first AS.Pros: Multiplayer, though to be honest it's not greatly improved from what I can tell.Cons: Single Player.  Really.  Save your money and just buy MoW Assault Squad.  It's cheeper and has the same maps and abiities (scratch and add a few minor things.)To give you an idea on how much they cheaped out on things, there's no real voice actors.  I first noticed it in the Russian campaign when I realized the ""commanders voice"" sounded like a 15 year old American boy.  All in all I wish I had my money back and stuck to the first AS.			"

But being only 16 and so having played the series since the age of 6 I can safley answer your question by saying, this game has been literaly the majorty of my life.

												You know, I really tried to get into the series cause of the whole Squad mechanic (AKA the inventory and the division of the squad). And a friend of mine got this when we though Men of war: Assault Squad was a cool game with the direct actions and stuff. Bare in mind, yes I am a Fan of Company of Heroes, I love the games, even the 2nd. But I can't endorse this game because of alot of broken promise. Already this game broke my warning signs:Warning #1: the game looks exacly like the first game with a deeper post processWarning #2: the game dropped into Early Access without any announcement even after the 1 month delay it had from feburary to marchWarning #3: the missions are recycled, as in the US and the Russians first missions.After that, I simply was done with the game. I will still play the game because of mods but I really really can't recommend this game. Go buy the first one.UPDATE!:So the game is now considered v1 with some updates and patches coming, My option still stands the same...... HOWEVER, There is only one thing I will say that this game have good and that's the mods, Espcially the SirHinkels Missions which have a far better level design than the ones that comes with the game.

												As of right now, I fail to see how MOWAS2 is anything more than a full price map pack with a few updated models.I have some issues with this developer so it really doesn't surprise me,  I'll reccomend this game if/when they pull their socks up*Note, I am well aware this game is in Beta/Early Access, it still doesnt change the fact that neither the early access content or what has been advertised looks to be anything more than a few new models, some revamped maps from old games, and a few new sounds.*and for christs sake guys. Update the infantry models from 2007, and stop abusing the rating system by flagging negative reviews as abuse. DMS, you're a joke			"

												dont let the red hand fool you, if your a fan of the first one then you will enjoy the different style missions, but as far as units, sound, and maps go this is the same game, i didnt even notice a difference in graphics, but the steam mod support just makes this game worth while to me, i give it a red hand because i dont like the company just using us for a quick money grab, but atleast the modders can still make a game out of this, if you use the right mods at once it can really just make the game fun, like the realism mod that fixes ranges for tanks and arty, really just makes you re-think everything about how you advance, and cheat mod for someone who just wants to mess around a bit, the company may have ruined the game but the steam community has made a real game out of this and i think if you really liked the first one this game given the right mods can blow you away.

												This is a re-hash of a re-hash of a re-market of a re-brand of a great game made an eternity ago called Soldiers Heroes of WW2 by a different developer who I believe hail from Ukraine.Digital Mindsoft got hold of the game assets which were in my opinion the foundations and ground work for one of the finest games of all time. They turned it into the original Men of War. Basicly a pollished version of the earlier Faces of War and SOWW2 (games had different names depending on the region/market).The original Men of War was a really really great game, down to the fact it cleaned up a few of the rough edges and packaged it into a good mix of singleplayer and multiplayer content that worked well.The potential was huge! Expansions, new maps endless possiblilties... no not from the devs - but the mod community who passionately created fantastic mods using the powerful yet simple and user-friendly game engine and included editor.Now imagine what a paid dev team working hard could create using that as a foundation. Now imagine what really happened: Assault squad (1) which was as much the same game with the added benefit of the world Assault in it. Don't forget the tweaked graphics. It's all about the screenshot baby. Roll in the dollar signs we have a winner. 90% marketing 5% game and 5% optimism.But wait... there is more!That isn't grand enough, lets widen the scope. Lets be bold and creative (the only way we know how), lets put a ""new"" version on Steam! People will part with cash for a number 2. It's proven science.Behold! MEN OF WAR: ASSAULT (on your wallet) SQUAD 2Just gotta' love a number 2.Letting the modders fix/add and create the content of ""your"" game Digital Mindsoft is all very well but don't give us the line that you don't work for free. As far as anyone can tell - you aren't working at all.			"

												Great game... If you haven't played Men Of War before.It is literally a re-port of the existing game and not worth the $30 price tag. If you have never played one of the men of war games before you will most likely enjoy it, but if you own Men Of War already; do not buy, you are wasting your money.I purchased thinking it would be upgraded with new units, new maps, new singleplayer battles, etc (because, you know, it says ""2"" and is advertised as being new) but it is exactly the same as the first game. Same units, same maps, same campaign battles, same UI, same menus, same modes, same graphics basically except a bit of a shine on it, same gameplay (for example the unit positioning hasnt been improved; its exactly the same) same bugs, etc.Practically fraud to call it ""2"" when what they should have sold it as:Men of war with minor graphic tweaks ($30 please).--------With the popularity of this review I should probably add some further thoughts (I had it refunded since but will expand on my thoughts).In my opinion the Men of War series are one of the best RTS's around for personal enjoyment, as I mostly play them on my own (not much multiplayer) and still managed to rack up a fair few hours on the first Men of War: Assault Squad. The problems with this particular one is more that I see no reason to buy it over Men of War: Assault Squad. Genuinely, there is hardly any difference.As I said, if you have never picked up a Men of War game and you like RTS games you can emerge yourself into, get deeply involved in, micro manage little details (I would even make little stories for my squads and follow them around and get sad if I lost a trooper I gave a nickname), then you will enjoy it, I think it's just not right to keep trying to sell these as new games, but the base game isn't a bad game (just get it on sale, it's not a polished AAA type of game, it has a very... Indie developer trying to go pro feel).Some notes:+ Battles are fun, and you can control each unit and each unit will interact with the map, like taking cover where you point, pick up weapons, ammo, etc.- Half the time the cover doesn't work properly and it glitches or units get stuck, etc. It can be frustrating trying to micro manage a squad to try and get them all behind cover.+Maps are large, expansive, lots of items, destructables, etc.- I've never been a fan of the reinforcement system used, on such large maps making reinforcements walk from 10,000 miles away. You can attach weapons to vehicles to tow and etc but its so much micro management that doing those tedious actions kind of takes away the fun.+ Can micromanage fun things.- Have to micromanage tedious things. Campaign:+ There is a campaign.- The voice overs. My god.- The missions are all the same basically for any faction.- Seriously, those voice overs. Just play some music and read the subtitles, you will have a better experience. NOW, obviously most of what I have mentioned is more single player based stuff. But honestly, this isn't a game I would be using to multiplayer ladder all pro style, it's something to kill some time and mess around with.So at the end of it all would I recommend it?  Yes, if you've never played it and it's on sale cheap. Otherwise, no. If it's full price, or you've played Men of War: Assault Squad before, there are just better games you could buy and spend your time on.Do I think it's a game most people will play, and keep playing continuously? No. I think the average player will probably play this for awhile, get a kick out of it for like 20-60 hours and then find it dropping off over time until it fills one of the 100+ slots occupied by a steam season sale, collect dust, until they bring out Assault Squad 3 and then you see this review all over again.

												Overall gamplay is good but worse than AS1. The lag and the inability to fix it since it's release is mindboggling. See strat29's comments.Edit: The game has been updated since early October however the update has not drastically changed the game to differentiate it enough from Assault Squad 1 (AS1). It has fixed the lag issue for the most part but it seems rather strange that the game was originally launched with such a blatant, arguably unplayable issue in the first place. There are no new factions, very few new maps, inability to play the large maps (8x8 for example) and a game that essentially replicates what AS1 does. Worth a buy? Maybe. Worth the supposed upgrade from AS1? Nope.Edit #2 (Version 3.115.0): In the last few weeks a new update and new features via a DLC were issued through steam. They've ironed out some of the issues that plagued the game since the latest series of updates but the game still has some relatively large issues that continute plague performance and multiplayer gameplay. If you're relatively new to this game and you're looking to experience multiplayer and ultimately test out your strategies, you may not have that great of a time. While many players will experience the following, it is new and casual players who will experience the following in a more frustrating fashion. Multiplayer is not ""smooth"", in fact many have complained it is essentially broken. Crashing (out of sync, random black screens, random dropping) is very common. Second, lag is an issue, period. Whether the lag issue is due to bad PC performance or latency issues, it is a problem for many. Third, multiplayer often requires you to connect with other players and form regular teams which can and is often frustrating for new and casual players (although I'm quite fine :)). A few more notes on the latest series of updates:- No 8v8.... yet?- Replay via the DLC is great but arguably a tad expensive considering what you get. Plus the replay feature does not have any control functions like pause, fast-forward, etc. Further, it is bugged. - Spectator slots are a great addition but it is also bugged and likely causes out-of-syc crashing issues.- Steam overlay is all messed up. The latest updates have rendered it useless which is a step backwards and quite surprising that it was not looked at before the release. - This company seems to think it's cool release release notes several days after an  update. I can definitely understand why new and casual players find the multiplayer aspect of this game frustrating. Not only is there a steep learning curve, it has a number of other issues which I noted. I should also note that the overall gameplay is still not better than AS1.Edit #3 (Version 3.122) as of May 23rd, 2015: This game has been updated several times since I last looked over my review of this game. I would like to note the following:- SOME Out-of-Sync in-game crashing has been fixed but it still occurs enough to delay a 2v2 tournament and was the direct cause of cancelling the 3v3 league (which I assisted in administering).  It is a MAJOR sore spot in the competitive part of the community. - Replays still crash as much as before. - I began a campaign for new maps to be implemented in a future version given this game's focus is primarily on multiplayer. I hope this is done because this game has lacked new, quality maps ever since it's release. I have no idea why this didn't cross their minds before hand... It now appears DMS may very well be including it in a future paid DLC pack, which if true, is a joke given that the maps they're reviewing are available FREE as a MOD (unfortunately too many AS2 players are ignorant of this).- Performance issues still exist (lag, PC performance). Still worse than AS1 in terms of performance. - Steam overlay is still completely broken, about a year since it's release.- Matchmaking, I finally tried it. It's been plagued with issues from day one, no end in sight. It is also not taken seriously, at all, by us in the competitive community.Edit #4 (Latest version as of July 16th, 2015): It's been almost two months since I updated this review to outline the latest version(s) so I'd like to note a few things:- Many people still play this game, albeit the singleplayer part of this game. Unfortunately this game, as all RTS games, is geared towards multiplayer. With that being said, the crashes I've noted early, among a new crash since the end of May and the out-of-sync errors that still occur have really hurt two communities: the more experienced modders and modding community and the competitive community. As of three weeks ago I stopped playing due to the sheer amount of errors in multiplayer and overall instability in the game's performance. - DMS has struggled to provide a smooth, stable multiplayer ever since it's release. I've been cautiously optimistic and hopeful but I've decided to move on generally and wish everyone good luck playing the game. Out-of-sync issues has decimated larger multiplayer games and as I've noted, the competitive side of the community. It's virtually impossibly to play consistent, stable 2v2, 3v3 and up games. With that being said, It's a game that I truly enjoyed but it's become too unstable to continue forwards.			"

												One of the finest games ever made. This is a large review of the game so go to appropriate sections if you do not wish to read the entire thing.***Brief Overview of the Game****Well there are 5 factions. On the Allies side is UK, Soviets and USA whilst on the Axis Japan and Germany.You have staple ""skirmish"" missions for each factions each with a different emphasis for example defense missions, tank only missions, stealth/sniper missions among others. However I won't go into too much detail into Singleplayer because Multiplayer is where the game shines.In Multiplayer there is no grinding to unlock certain powerful units, everything is unlocked from the start from a M20 to a King Tiger. Now you receive a certain amount of set Manpower each game which on competitive settings is 3000 base manpower plus ""payback"" which usually comes to around 800-1000mp. There is no base building or collecting resources it is a set amount per second until it reaches 3000 with extras coming through payback that is dependent upon how much MP you have already lost and how much CP you have on the field.CP (command points) is a value that every unit in the game also receives. You are limited to 100 CP on normal settings which obviously means you cannot completely overwhelm the map with inf or tanks. Heavier tanks cost more CP, so not only are they expensive in MP but they also limit your ability to field infantry to cover LOS and attack flags.***Key Features/Strengths of the Game***The physics mechanics of the game of completely unique. Unlike most RTS games which work on an arcadey system of hitpoints with certain values working well against other other values ""unit X has 10 pierce damage and 5 blunt damage"", Mowas 2 is quasi-realistic. Whilst counters in most RTS are static and predetermined (you know exactly how much damage your unit will do the enemy unit) in Mowas2 that is not necessary the case. It is very possible and does happen that a tier 1 Volkstrum Sqaud can ambush and kill a tier 4 SAS squad if it is ambushed out in the open. This is particularily prevalent in tank combat where even an 240MP Damier amoured car 2 pounder gun can penetrate the side armour of a 1250MP Che Ri or even an KT at 2400MP. Of course this requires the Damier to get to point blank range on those tanks in order destroy them and the KT and Che Ri can ""max range"" penetrate the Damier with ease at 140 range. It is this uncertainity regarding counters that adds a great dynamic to the game as not only does allow players to make comebacks if they are behind on MP by using sneaky inf to destory heavy tanks or using superior tank play yourself and killing a superior tank.Direct Control is the other great strength of this game. The game engine allows you to 3rd person mode control any unit in the game. That is, if you press left Ctrl or E you can manually take the place of the AI and take matters into your own hands. So if you feel like your MG is not doing a good enough job of mowing down an enemy sqaud you can ""DC"" the MG yourself. This is mostly applicable with tanks though (as they are your expensive purchases) as often you will know the weak spots on an enemy tank armour to aim for. ***Weaknesses of the Game***A very steep learning curve. This is not like TW where even relatively newby's can put up a good fight and find other relative newby's quickly. Even 30 hours in this game makes a huge difference in your ability. You will get beaten, and beaten badly in a lot of games. There is a lot to manage and consider in this game and you will be overwhelmed at the start. Bear in mind though the better players you play with, the faster you will improve (even if you might lose a bit more). The rewards for getting good at this game are huge though. Close, tight games on Mowas2 are like nothing else, spoken from a guy who has 1350 hours :pAlthough the game does look great on high settings, it is very poorly optimized and puts a much greater strain on your graphics card that it should do. Also if one player has poor performance in a game it can lag the game for everyone else which is very frustrating.The developers have only limited resources. Digital Mind Soft (DMS) are a limited company at this point in time and are spending much of their time working on Call to Arms Mowas2's Modern Era Sequel. It means they are limited in providing support to Mowas 2. Bugs can take time to be ironed out and balance patches take a bit of time. ***Overall Personal Summary***This series captures that perfect balance between fast paced gameplay and serious strategy. Unlike many more traditional RTS's this succeed in this game you do not need to have absurd twitch reactions (although of course they help) yet it is not a time consuming slug fest or 'grand strategy'. It is the brilliance of the engine the game physics were this game is so unique. The ability to directly control anything you own in a quasi 3rd person mode offers so much more than most RTS's. Especially when given the WW2 focus and the vast variety of tanks you can play with, it is like playing a lite version of WoT or WT except there is incredible amount more depth with combining arms of many different facets of the game - you have to simultaniously manage infantry, tanks, anti-infantry and anti tank assets. It was this game which allowed me to get into competitive gaming. Of course I would never put 1300 hours into a game if I didn't have that extra element of motivation namely competing yet still this a quite superb game and I would thoroughly recommend it to anybody.

Early Access Review
								I just want to say that this game is fun, but it's completely not worth supporting. The game seems to be in beta stage still even though it's fully released. It has a signficant lack of content and the makers have yet to actually add everything they have promised. It's extremelly hard to find a game, relating to how it feels like it's still a beta. It has a XP System which completely ruined the games experience, the community is way to small for something like an XP System also. There aren't to many missions for all of the factions (Which is currently at 3 factions still), they may be some what long but they are all literally the same missions for each faction showing an extreme lack of effort and laziness. The path finding from the AI can be good at most times but you will constantly find times of your AI acting like idiots (causing them to get kill and completely ruin your strategy) I've never actaully wanted a refund for a game until now, which is saying a lot because I own a good amount of COD games. I'm disapointed in the developers and hope if they ever make a game they don't ♥♥♥♥ up as crappy as they did this time.			"

												Men of War is a great game, and I can only hope the best for its future and for the moderators. This game demonstrates general realism and immersion on the battlefield; but I do have complaints. For example, the game isnt realistic enough. Some people will diagree but this game being in the genre it needs more realsim in the base vanilla game. Maybe make the spotting ranges of the units higher and make infantry's health lower. Another problem is overpowered nations. Germany as a faction dominates the multiplayer battlefield. Spending over 1000 hours in the MOW AS series is proof of these experiences. With minor moding (supported), this game goes from good to god. I must say the editor is well done by the way. I'm also happy to say that the community will support you in any trouble you stumble across. Overall, if your looking to command an army over a vast battlefield with wild possibilities and suprising turns... give this game a try.			"

												Finally a game about ww2 without one-sided balance. You can die for the Motherland, Fatherland, Churchill, Freedumbs or Emperor without yelling that everything enemy has is OP (japanese tanks will make you raise your eyebrows tho). Everything feels good: how tanks react, how infantry throw grenades or change weapons depending on target on their own, tanks and artillery operate at beliveable range, armor thickness and angle seems to work in realistic fashion too. However some weapons that should penetrate 160mm of armor can't kill pz4 which may be just bad luck, but is irritating for sure. Also it's always a big fanservice to me when each faction speaks on it's own language, instead of ""Kill that faschistsky ♥♥♥♥ for stalin comerade boris tovarichs brat comerade"" nonsense.But, and it's a big BUT (Y(__|, there's some things that really SUCK:1) it's basically same as previous game with like 5 new maps, fancier graphics and ♥♥♥♥♥ier netcode, yet costs full price and it seems that AS1 servers are closed.2)If someone in same match as you have PC FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES, you will have tremendous lags too.3)Units' pathfinding is probably most infuriating thing i encountered in my life, and believe me, living in Russia you will get thing or two to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at in your lyf. Units will try to go through impassable terrain and get stuck if you wont control them like babies, infantryman, after an order to throw grenade can start doing modern dance moves and catch a bullet instead, SU-122 will agro at infantry and will get shot by Jagtiger in the ♥♥♥ when you're not looking, etc.4)INTERFACE. Your first couple of hours will be literally unplayable since you will have to call all the scientists in the world specializing in awful GUI to help you figure out what the hell is going on with this squad control. Also half of your keyboard is some random hotkeys that control everything from towing artillery pieces to manually jacking off your soldiers.5)Units' field of view: you will see for yourself should you decide to play this.6)ELO in a game where 2v2, 3v3, 4v4 modes exist. People just never learn that it only works in 1v1. Now after my ♥♥♥ finally chilled, let's get back to good shieeet again.   Unit variety: even tho as a result of applying semi-realistic characteristics to tanks and stuff some units are just too useless to call-in, amount of options is really big for each faction. Even tho, as example, for soviets you will usually get something like some infantry, dshk, zis and then if everything is good you will wait for t34/57 or get that funny howitzer-tin coffin-tank thing that's at lvl 10 or something, or t60, things that you can do with spetznaz with stolen bazooka and flamethrower guy are lewder than most kinky porn. Also when was the last time you saw flamethrowers actually burning everyhing inside of a tank? Games like Company of Jobbers 2 will always shield themselves with some non-existant ""MUH BALANCE"" holy cow, but in reality Relic just dont know how things work and can't code if their life depended on it.Manual aim: this is plain fun, even though it seems tanks ironically actually lose in accuracy if you manually aim them. If you remember Crimsonland - when you control soldier with PTRs and noscope360 enemies through covers it feels just like this. However, while you having fun you will probably lose rest of the army because i didn't find anything resembling CONTROL GROUPS IN THIS GAME AND WORKING WITH THIS MINIMAP REQUIRES 900+ APM.  Little things: A lot of things here are just priceless: manually refilling artillery ammunition with infantry squad by moving shells from a truck through inventory (if you played a lot of Zuma at MLG tournaments you will be good at this), shooting cow and then search it's corpse, kill a guy, stuff his corpse's inventory with artillery shells and then move it near your artillery like some sort of death metal treasure chest, throw grenade into trench and then order machinegun to fire at position so enemy won't ever escape, run your flamethrower tank through building filled with enemies, ram enemy fortifications and then detonate it with grenade to see most useless fireworks ever, roll out IS-3 and lose it to one-shot from enemy AT, etc.I give this game 100 executed war prisoners out of 100. Even though interface and matchmaking are modern means of mental torture, game itself is pure fun. As for singleplayer missions - they don't seem to be as much fun as they were in very first Men of War so i never tried them.Win for the Rodina or die trying!			"

												Pretty much perfect in every way, one of the best RTS games I've ever played. The attention to detail is amazing.Shells can pierce multiple armoured targets...Infantry have multiple hitboxes, able to lose their helmet or even rifle if sent flying by an explosionInfantry can search other infantrys corpses, taking their weapons, helmets and even bandages (or dynamite from a armoured vehicle)...Tanks dont have health bars, they have damage modelling, so a panzer IV wont take out a churchill, unlike CoH...Units are made in favour of realism rather than balance, if it was bad in real life, its bad here...Surprisingly active multiplayer community...Great freedom in what your units can physically do, you can send your men into an allys tank if one of his crew died, for example...You can take control of a single unit/vehicle at any time, controlling how it moves, where it fires, what it does. You can cook a grenade, conduct a charge, take control a single man with a flamethrower, scorching the enemy trenchlines, angle your tank armour so enemy rounds bounce off, aim for weak spots of enemy tanks, etc...Your tank crew can escape a inoperable vehicle, and blow it up with dynamite to prevent it being stolen, (Or even used in a last ditch effort to take your enemy with you)You can decrew and steal enemy vehicles, even towing their anti tank guns against them...If you can think of it, you can probably do it.

												My review is based upon singleplayer only, i havent touched the multiplayer and perhaps that is where the real focus of this game lays, but for anyone out there that is also interested in the singleplayer aspect, this is for you.First off, the game uses the standard men of war style play, in that respect you cant go wrong with the gameplay, its fun to direct control units and blow things up, nothing much has changed here since ""Soldiers:heroes of ww2"", you still cant properly direct control into buildings as infantry. Here is where my real issue with this game comes, the singleplayer maps. Theres no real story like previous men of war games (unlike the first assault squad which also had no story). Their is 6 or 7 missions for each faction, brits, germans, russians etc. Nearly every single map is the same, a long corridor which you must advance up and take control of the flags. There is no room for flanking, no room for any tactical depth, its basically direct control one unit and slowly advance him up taking out everything. Occasionally something different will happen, like you need to defend the flag for X amount of time. Its hardly stimulating tactically for example the start of the first mission it gives you 1 squad of infantry to defend against an attack, you literally do not have to issue a single order, your men will sit in the trench and return fire for 3 minutes until it progress' onto the corridor style level layout. Its pointless, you may aswell just speed up time to get it out of the way.Some of the missions are even dlc missions that were released for the first men of war. So ive paid for the exact same maps twice now.Here is the real stinker though. Youve completed all the missions for the nation that you chose to play as first, time to try out some of the other nations! Wait ... this map looks awfully familiar ....oh thats right, it is! The other nations are all carbon copies of the same maps just reskinned to look different with the units of that nation put in instead. Dont get me wrong they look quite nice the maps but there is only so many times you can advance up the same corridor of a map with the tiniest of differences between them. In essence the only saving grace is the community workshop, which is sad that your relying on user generated content to enjoy a game you paid for. It is truely a sad state of affairs that the game which started this series off ""Soldiers heroes of ww2"" released over 10 years ago had more complex missions, a better story and more varied missions than this. I do not think this title warrants calling itself a sequel to assault squad 1, its pretty much the same game but better graphics.Perhaps the multiplayer is the saving grace of this series, i dont know. But like me if your interested in singleplayer missions, avoid this unless some really good steam workshop stuff comes out. Play the original men of war, faces of war or even soldiers heroes of ww2 instead they are all vastly superior singleplayer experiences.Shame, i was hoping for more after assault squad one, not more of the same.

												If you are a hardcore fan of the franchise then you may be a bit disappointed with this release. In terms of the core game mechanics and gameplay then you will be somewhat satisfied as these remain true as the original. However in terms of graphical fidelity then this is a great letdown. If anything this game is just a slight graphical update upon the original and I would not recommend you buy this game... yet. All that has happened is there has been integration with steam and thats about it. So I wouldn't throw your money at this title quite yet.			"

												This game has been a huge disappointment. My hopes were not high, reading the features that were going to be in this game before release, but I am disappointed, nonetheless.If you enjoyed Assault Squad 1, and want to continue playing that game online, you're practically forced into buying Assault Squad 2, as the imminent demise of Gamespy means that the multiplayer in the previous Men of War titles will soon be defunct. The switch from Gamespy server to Steam server has not been a graceful one either, navigating from menu to menu in the internet menus takes a lot longer than it used to. Previously, joining a server rarely took longer than a second, now on the steam servers, it regularly takes upwards of 10 just to connect. Global chat has been replaced by a steam chat channel that requires you to use the steam overlay, or have it open on a separate window entirely, and you can no longer see another player's game information (games played, won, quit, etc), now the info button just brings you to their steam achievements page. Hopefully the steam servers mean that everyone will stay on the same version number, which was a previous issue.The UI has been changed in a few ways. For vehicles, the icons are more or less the same, just stacked horizontally as well as vertically, but for infantry, the icons have become much smaller. It was hard to tell what units were what at first because there's nothing to explain it, but on my own I learned that a red line above the infantry icon denotes an AT launcher in the squad, and a yellow line above the icon denotes an AT rifle. I suppose this is inoffensive but contrasted with the background, it's hard to see how many infantry units are in a given squad.Unit-wise, almost nothing has changed, except many cannon ranges has been decreased by about 10m. You can order “elite” units of some infantry (Machinegunners, AT teams) which is the same composition plus or minus one squad member with higher weapon skill. All infantry seem to have higher stealth ratings, for better or worse.There are many more maps than there were previously, thankfully, some of which are from the DLC of the previous game, but I believe some of them are new.Now the 3 damning points about this game that make it not worth 30$1. No bugs to my knowledge have been fixed, every glitch you can think of is still in the game, and the game still crashes with no notice.2. The unlock system. This system is so amazingly out of place in Men of War, there's no other word for it but insulting. Units are locked until you reach a specific level. If you're a veteran Men of War player, this means that until you reach the required level, which can take tens of games, you get no artillery, no super heavy tanks, and a handful of other units. This is so baffling as to why they would even think of putting this system in this game. There are only two possibilities in my mind, why a company would put this in a game, either to make the game more like Company of Heroes, the much more popular WWII real time stratege/tactics game, or more cynically, just so that they can sell their deluxe edition of AS2, which increases exp rewards, unlocking things faster. The host can unlock all units on a per-game basis, but locking units based on individual player experience (not skill), is just a waste of time.3. It's 30$ (or more) for the same game, with no fixes, very few unit changes, vague improvements that don't have much of an impact at all, and an unbelievably insulting unlock gimmick.I think everything in this game must have been planned as DLC or update content for AS1, and they decided to slap a new title and a full price (the same price AS1 has been at for years) so that they could charge everybody for DLC instead of just the people who would have bought DLC anyway. A solution for this would have been to offer a much more generous discount to the people who owned it, because if you own AS1 and the DLC for it,  you practically own a better version of AS2, just one that won't be playable online in a few weeks. Thanks DMS.			"

												There's not that many strategy games out there nowadays and those that do come out usually end up as a disappointment because of being either too bad of a game or too simple and generic (A + Click, I win etc) with no strategy or tactic in place.The problem with Men of War Assault Squad 2 does not fall into either of these categories. It falls into a special one Now, when I first heard that they'll be releasing a MoW2 with Steam Intergration I was excited until I saw the price and notice that not many things changed. Paying ~$35 for the same thing is not really a good thing so I decided to buy on sale which I did. And from what I've experienced thus far, thank goodness I bought it from the sale._______________________________________Gameplay--------------------------------------------------------------At it's core, MOWAS 2 is a 'what if' Company Of Heroes 2 had much more micromangement and detail involved without the base building and includes mechanics such as managing an individuals soldier, tank or artillery inventory and even ASSUMING CONTROL of them when needed to fine tune your orders such as timing a cooked grenade toss or aiming a specific part of the target etc.Armoured Warfare in this game puts CoH2's to shame because of how each (and there's a lot) and every Tank has seperate parts which can be neutralized to decommision a tank such as destroying its mobility with a shot to its track or destroying its main gun so that it can no longer fire. Note that they can be repaired should the inventory of the tank or crew have a spare repair kit. The way tanks are destoyed in this game is also amazing as tanks do not have health but instead, rely on their armour thickness and the direction from which the AT fire came from (did it hit from a sloped angle or the rear? etc) so you won't see funny things like a Stuart destroying a King Tiger.The gameplay in this game is solid and rather in-depth which is the main reason why I enjoy this game so much._______________________________________Single Player--------------------------------------------------------------Nothing too interesting here. 7-ish missions for each of the 5 factions which are basically reskins of one another. Luckily, there are mods that add interesting scenarios and SP (or Co-op) missions of their own.However, Single Player Co-Op has this weird mechanic where person A can buy a Tank but the game decides to give said Tank to person B because he has a smaller army count. In addition, buying a 8-man squad can end up becoming a 2-man squad as a result of this mechanic. Though units can be given away to other players, for a game that has players speaking many languges, trying to share these units can be a hard unless playing with a friend in which case it's only a minor annoyance.SP can be fun though doing the same thing over and over again can get boring unless you use mods by individuals such as Sir Hinkel._______________________________________Multiplayer--------------------------------------------------------------Alongside the weird 'sharing units in Single Player campaign' thingy, multiplayer also has a weird mechanic which although can be turned off in an unranked lobby by the host, it cannot be turned off in ranked matches, period.Basically, its a levelling system. If I'm not mistaken, the maximum level that one can achieve is around 20 if not more. At level 20, you can purchase any units during a ranked game. At level 1 which most people start as off, you can only purchase half the units at your disposal. Basically, your low level is preventing you from making any expensive yet powerful purchases such as Elite Infantry Units, Heavier Tanks and Heavy Artillery support including half of your special faction troops being locked.How does 1 increase their level? Two ways. Either they play (and finish) more ranked matches or play through the SP campaign either alone or with a friend.This levelling system is in my opinion, extremely flawed for players attempting to get their feet wet in ranked multiplayer. Aside from some toxic players which most game have, going against a level 20 opponent when you're simply level 1 offers the new player a huge disadvantage for them and removes the fun for him as he will basically get rofl stomped by superior equipment. In addition to this, most players who I've met in a ranked game tend to have double digit levels while I'm still level 3 and I fail to see how this create a valid and fair leaderboard let alone match when high level players are always going up against lower tier players such as myself. To me, this seems downright broken and makes ranked matches unplayable until I've played a countless number of SP missions for a game that emphasizes on Multiplayer. This mechanic is such a major turnoff that I regret buying this game, even though it was during a deal UNLESS players start getting paired against similarly ranked or levelled players.One thing that this game has done to avoid players from dropping is by forcing you to finish a game by removing any form of concede button where only your ELO is affected. Instead, even when outnumbered in a 2v1, 4v2 or any other match where you've lost everything, leaving a game midway will do three things instead. Decrease your ELO, degrades your Ranked Trust Rating and finally, Negates you from earning any EXP you gained from that match neccessary to level up your army. And mind you the levels are factions specific. You can have a level 4 Germany army but a level 1 UK army.So, do players finish a losing game where they get absolutely zero enjoyment because of getting owned hard? No, they don't. They either cut their internet connection, desync the game or simply use Task Manager to close it. Through this,  there would be no changes for their ELO, trust rating or EXP earned._______________________________________Stability--------------------------------------------------------------The stability for this game is poor. Playing with Local friends won't even mitigate the issue as I still get kicked out of a game even if said friend was living around my neighbourhood. The most notorious one of them all is the 'Out-Of-Sync' Error. This error freezes your game and happens at random intervals and can get very frustrating as it will not record down the online game you spent 45-60 minutes playing. Error dc:x are also annoying. From what I've gathered, Error dc:0 = the host kicked you mainly due to your ping which is a joke considering that only PC Performance matters while Error dc:3 which is basically the game being a jerk to you.Keep in mind that this game was in EARLY ACCESS for a couple of months and after its release on April/May 2014, it still gets this kind of problems which is downright unacceptable considering how long of a chance they had to fix this. Heck, the developers are even releasing another EARLY ACCESS game which appears to be MOWAS with a Modern Era reskin somewhere this year which means there goes the technical support for the game.Conclusion--------------------------------------------------------------Good game, great gameplay, great mechanic. Poor Ranked Multiplayer. Horrendous StabilityAnd as MOWAS 2 is a multiplayer orientated game whose only major difference from its predecessor is Steam Intergration with the price of ~$40, I can't recommend this game to anyone unless its on sale.~Edited due to Stability issues			"

												This is just Assault Squad 1 repackaged and slightly worse with bugs the devs haven't fixed. They keep rapidly ""updating"" the game with useless crap which serves only to break mods. The company has some scumbag business tactics including a $10 DLC just so AI work, and they don't even work that well.

												It's sad that the developers of these games gave up so many years ago. The ""Single player missions"" in this game are boring, storyless multiplayer maps with bad AI. Nothing more. They have no objective other than pushing forward and capturing ""flags""The multiplayer community is small, toxic and crippled by horrible engine optimization and network connection errors. You'll be lucky to ever finish a match in this game without someone lagging out or being kicked by players who refuse to communicate.I'm reinstalling Faces of War and playing the single player campaign again (4th time). I will never buy one of these games again, you've ruined it for yourselves.			"

												Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is an effort to produce a WW2 RTS that feels authentic, vehicles and soldiers have ammunition, weapons have their characteristics modelled accurately and armour penetration chances too. This then leads to wider considerations such as logistics on the battlefield, the careful selection of units and your force composition etc. The singleplayer campaigns for the five playable nations will break you in nicely ready for multiplayer, and multiplayer has a variety of modes such as; co op skirmishes, vicotry point matches and comabt matches. The graphics and effects look really nice but can be a drain if the system is getting on a bit, so be warned before cranking it up to ultra! Other features such as direct control mode allow a single unit, from a lowly rifleman to a 50 ton tank, to contorlled directly by the player - aiming weapons, steering/ movement etc - thus providing a finer degree of control over more specialised vehicles/ situations. Would certainly recommend if you want something inbetween COH 1/2 and more serious games like the Combat Mission series.			"

												Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is a real-time strategy from Digitalmindsoft, a sequel to Men of War: Assault Squad. It's a micromanagement genre but ever since the first Men of War, Men of War: Assault Squad 2 has been reworked for more bigger battles and easier management while still giving the same challenge for tactics.In gameplay terms, while not so much different from previous titles, not to mention the whole missions from the first Assault Squad are actually here as well, It has been improved so much since release and with patches. For example when your squad is out of ammo, you don't have to actually resupply each of them with inventory control anymore, you can simply call a supply drop with smoke grenade if available, or spawn in a supply truck, each has a resupply ability for your units, even vehicles, as long as it is the right type of supplying units of course. The American airborne drops has also been upgraded, no longer you paradrop a single soldier who will die instantly when he reach the ground, but an actual squad of airborne infantry. Coming with Airborne DLC, now you can play with bots in multiplayer! Even though the bots doesn't really give actual challenge, at least you can have something to play with. Though the bots only available on Assault Zones and Capture the Flag mode. You also get some extra skirmish missions from the vanilla and more from DLC. While there are some improvements, Assault Squad 2 still has much potential to get some extras.The graphics, while at release is not that different from the first Assault Squad, after many patches, it has been greatly improved especially when it comes to unit models and textures like vehicle and tanks, infantry skins now has winter and desert version for their corresponding maps. Overall the graphics has been indeed improved a lot. The performances are not bad, but surely can see some improvements and fixes. While most of the time there is no stutter or lags, in multiplayer somehow the performances like to drop like crazy at sometime. But in singleplayer there is no issues. This is strange since singleplayer are the one who used more processing because there is scripts and more AI.Things that Men of War are very great at are modifications! Men of War: Assault Squad 2 now support Steam Workshops for community made content so there's no need to find them on other site, or upload your creation elsewhere. This also makes downloading modifications more easier than before.Overall, Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is quite solid for a sequel, I recommend this!Rating 8/10			"

												Forword: Im a bit disappointed. I recently started to play the Men of War Franchise so im not to familiar with the Series but AS2 is basically AS with a bit better graphics, worse performance, some good changes like Squad Resupply (or atleast i think this is new). For the Skirmishes most of them are just the Skirmishes from AS2. Now I know that this Game should be played in MP but Im not to fond of RTS MP Games I rather play SP so I was really disappointed and feel a bit scammed. All my Experience is from the SP. I havent touched the MP yet.The Good:- Graphics and Effects are nice- AI is great and challenging- New Units- Squad Resupply- better Pathfinding- dotted walk/run Line for your Movement- Cover Ghosts are more Accurate. Atleast it feels like it.- some good new Skirmishes- Matchmaking System- Steam Workshop- The Bad:- Lots of reused Skirmishes of the previous AS Game- The Performance got worse- Vehicle behaviour when your not controlling them i.e. shooting HE Rounds and Infantry while beeing bombarded by an enemy Tank and so on-- My Rig:- i7 2600- GTX 670- Game runs on SSD- Everything Maxed and 4x AA- too similar to AS to justify the purchase- The Ugly:- Matchmaking seems to be broken or no one uses it.- MP seems dead. When i looked there were 3 games with 10ppl playing.So for me I would rather say buy AS1, its a better bang for your buck at the moment. "

								First off I am going to write this review assuming you have played the original MoW:AS.1.)  It has stepped up and offers outstanding graphics compared to the original. (The dirt is so beautiful)2.)  The AI is human-like and fluctuates on its reactions as the battelfield changes. (Hiding in impact craters, using tank husks as cover)3.)  It offers a few new maps (as far as the Beta is concerned). It also has a few old ones.4.)  All the sounds, music, and textures are recycled from the original.      That's about it in regards to being different to MoW: ASThe second part of this review will be to describe the MoW experience to those that have yet to play this game.1.)  The game is brutal, and unforgiving. (not your typical RTS) You must use your resources wisely as you only get so much and to recover mistakes mid game is almost impossible.2.)  This game stresses on hardcore realism in regards to bullet penetration and physics. (Tank rounds will bounce off certain tanks and shred others.)3.)  If your infantry is not in cover, they are already dead. (Tactical placement of infantry is the key to victory.)4.)  This game is basically as real as war can get. 5.)  If you press down your Ctrl key you are able to manually control and operate any unit. (This is a big plus to the RTS genre.)All in all it is a decent game, however for the fans of the original, you may be disappointed with this new release as it has little to no changes gameplay-wise. However, if you are new to the series then I suggest you watch a few videos to see if this game is right for you.Update: 3/19/14: 1C has pushed this game back yet again for the second time since they collected for preorders. The game is now available for Early Access, not recommended, although my review above still stands true.			"

								In its current form, the multiplayer, which is really the meat of this series, is completely unplayable. Every game someone drops. Every game lags. The ""New"" Engine appears to be responsible, at least to me. It's unstable as Hell, and this is really disappointing. My system specs are exceptional as well, so I doubt its my i7 and GTX 680. Or everyone else's rig.I regret my purchase in the extreme, because this is so unpolished. There is a difference between Early Access and the garbage that this has turned out to be. It's a shame, because the series used to be quite good, and as of right now, after hours of playing, I've successfully had one game that didn't have someone drop.Avoid if you're into Multiplayer. Avoid like the plague.			"

Simply the best. Before this game I used to play Soldiers Heroes of World War 2 (SHOWW2 for short) when I was 9 years old, which was the 1st ever Men of War game! I was pretty sad when I found out that nobody played that MP game and all the units that went into the waste. But then I found out that there was this series called Men of War and now I'm reliving my dream. After playing this game I cannot and I repeat CAN NOT go back to Company of Heroes 2 cause it's unrealistic and I'm so used to damaging the machines that I find it unrealistic how those units suck up damage and the HP bar. All in all If you enjoy realistic games and teamwork then this game is for you.

Early Access Review
								I'm an open minded person, and I love games of all genres. I have a particular love for RTS games, and found the original Men of War Assault Squad to be very fun to play, if a little on the shallow side for graphics, optimization, and a terrible AI system. With AS2 promising to fix all these, it seemed like a good idea at the time.Needless to say, I was very disappointed with it. I haven't logged too much time into this game because not only have the graphics barely improved aside from what seems to be better graphics quite literally MIXED IN with the older, crappy graphics at random (first mission of soviets, nuff said), it's now poorly optimized to the point that my hex-core 3.5 ghz computer with 64 gigs of ram and twin GTX titans will lag and, if it isn't lagging and actually running a solid 60 fps, FREEZE every few seconds for about a second. The UI is exactly the same as before, the AI is still not AI in my opinion as scripts should not count, and I was greeted with a lazy menu that used the same music and style of the previous game! The in-game music is the same too, voice acting has barely improved and only in CERTAIN areas, and on top of that the game pulled a stunt going from beta to early access without more than 1 day's notice. The only area that seems to have improved in a truly useful way is the multiplayer, which now uses steam instead of an external service, as well as steam workshop support for easy access to mods and maps, which I will give it credit for adding - these are much needed to this game and all games in general as Gamespy is going down and workshop just increases replayability of ANY title massively and will likely lead to me playing this game quite a bit more to enjoy workshop content.I am not saying the men of war series of games are bad, because they are very fun to play. I am saying that this game should not be counted as a sequel to the first game - it is at best an expansion (with the majority of its content being from AS1), and does not live up to what I had expected in the slightest from this title as a full on sequel at the full price of a sequel.

												As of right now in beta. It isn't looking good. The game looks like a direct copy of its predecessor in looks and gameplay and i personally definitely hope this is a NEW game not a copy of the old game with some added maps. As far as i see it needs work. Yes, it's in beta. But i see no evidence of any new features of anything significantly impressive about the '2' in the game. You can play the two side by side and hadly be able to tell the difference between them. Except that this second version's maps are broken and the AI can be a lot stupider than before. It looks and plays fine on difficulties easy and normal. But is lacking the realistic aspect this game is going for when you play on expert mode. Bushes do not give you cover and the enemy AI have aim that you can only beat when you take direct control of a unit. As im going through the game this is my initial opinion based on the completion of the first campaign. I have high hopes and i love the first Men of War. But when they released a sequal i was hoping for something better. Like maybe more focus on the Vietnam era? Or the Korean War? As the second world war seems to very extremely overdone. But no matter what i will always buy and play the sequals to any Men of War title as it's an amazing game overall. As of now, if you are interested in the game buy it now while it's on sale and enjoy it when they start shelling some patches. But if you want the buy this game as a newcomer of the Men of War games go for the first game as it's a lot more fun and enjoyable.EDIT: 2:18 PM One hour laterGame ended up crashing on me a few times midway into a mission. sequence error. Ive seen people having this problem constantly as well in the reviews including the one that the developer team deleted themselves. Which out of context, i think that review had been pretty honest and the developers' flagging response did seem pretty petty. But otherwise this game has many more errors now that i see. And it still is the same game as before. Same mission plots as well. Such as Germany Mission 1. A defence mission exactly like MoW 1 US mission 3 where you defend the Phillipines. Which by the way has an INFAMOUS history of crashing. The Phillipines on MoW 1 was unplayable in multiplayer. Which brings me to suggest you may need to readvise how you put together your defending missions, as of right now the reveiw is still for people to wait until buying this game if they want the full experience.EDIT 2/25 8:02 PM 24 Hrs of gameplayI enjoy the game and it's a great game. Still do not recommend to people who are just getting into the men of war games. But one thing i definitely keep in heart is ""If you want to have the best possible Men of War experience we strongly recommend to wait for the full game. Playing the beta is at your own risk and you will very likely encounter issues that are not present in the final version."" From the developers news of the people preordering getting open beta access. I agree 100% and i definitely appreciate the honesty because it basically can sum up my review, being wary that it is a beta, but one thing i would like to reiterate is the fact that they need to make sure it has a significant difference in gameplay or AI rather than something people can claim to be a 'copy and paste' game.EDIT 2/25 12:21 AMGame is finished, Looks good, Plays good, But i still say that you should buy the first one and play through it first. As in my opinion it is better, and or the same exact game. If you already have the first one. Definitely buy this, specially if it goes up for sale.EDIT: 7/16/2015 1:34 AMThey're releasing overly priced DLCs to make up for the fact that the game was an exact copy of the first game even still. Yes i love Assault Squad. But i disagree with the cash grabs that the developers are choosing to go through with. I have to pay $9.99 to have a feature that should have been in the base game. AI players? Third person mode? Base game tanks? MORE singleplayer missions? PLEASE stop trying to take my money and give me a game I will enjoy and continue to play even past it's time. I sure hope the developer comes to their senses and stops charging people for features that belong in the base game. My OVERALL opinion. Don't buy this game. Buy the much mroe completed first version for cheaper, and if you like that version, invest in this second version because this still remains to be a large DLC of the first game.			"

												Im a big fan of the MoW series, and Assualt Squad 2 is no exception with its amazing gameplay, but the multiplayer is sadly the downfall of the game itself. The game, just like its predecesors, has a bit of a learning curve with it. The rewards of learning can be of a great benefit and makes the game a whole lot more fun.Now lets talk about the single player aspect first before the multiplayer. The single player portion of the game is pretty good, with four difficulty levels ranging from easy to hard, and you can tell the difference from easy being a cake walk to hard... being just about impossible unless you know every little thing there is to know about the game. But man, can it be incredibly fun. You have five different factions to choose from with several skirmish missions to try for each. Each faction has thier own style making each one very unique to the other. You can play all of these missions by yourself or together on multiplayer. With single player you can pause the game, slow down the speed, or even speed things up. There are a few mods out there that can really spice the game up as well, which can be played by both single or mulitplayer. The multiplayer is possible the only bad thing about this great game. The community is very small and many games that are hosted are either locked by passwords, or your kicked as soon as you enter the lobby. This can make you spend hours just trying to find or create a game instead of playing it. Every blue moon you might actually find a decent group of players who like to play the game for fun and not competitively to the point where they kick you becuase your rank is to low or to high. When you do get a game you may find that it sometimes lags pretty bad. The ping can be horrendous at times even with just 2 people, but then again you can find a game where there is no sign of lag at all, even with a group of 8 people! The games themselves mostly rely on a individual's own internet connection and not a dedicated server.   The multiplayer is actually a lot of fun if you can find a group or have a few friends that like to play, but going in alone with the community thats on right now is terrible. The multiplayer was one of the main factors for me getting this game in the first place, and im sadly disappointed by the outcome. If you don't care for the multiplayer portion or have a group of friends to play with on here, then its a great game that i recommend buying, but if multiplayer is a big deal, then you better pass up on this until something changes with the community thats on right now. It is really a shame.			"

												The Men of war series are great WW2 RTS games, reasonably realistic, balanced and historically accurate when compared to other similar games in the genre.  Overview:	 Assault Squad 2 is more of a standalone expansion, in a sense that it builds on the previous titles and stays true to the format, rather than changing it to the point that it loses what makes it great. The game is both fun and challenging, with an added educational aspect with the inclusion of units, vehicles, and weapons of which may help you gain a better understating of their roles in the second world war. What's new?:	 An entirely  new feature to Assault Squad 2 is the soldiers now gather experience for their actions, increasing their effectiveness on the battle field, whereas previously long standing soldiers would run out of ammo and may become deadweight, or a micro management calamity. Ammo boxes and supply trucks now generate a field to resupply soldiers and weapons in the nearby vicinity, making it easier to manage your units, particularly in heated or drawn-out engagements. Features:	 One feature of the MOW series worth mentioning is the game speed control function, the ability to scale several different speeds during the game is a great feature. It is particularly useful for micro managing things such as soldiers inventory, mine laying, vehicle/weapon repair and the use of medics. It is also very helpful to players new to the game, and also to just observe the action in slow motion close up.Assault Squad 2 has mod support, with an in game menu to activate/de-activate them as you please, as well as a Steam workshop, where you can download mods with the click of a button, no messy installations or file overwrites. What gives the game increased longevity is the modding community, they allow you to expand on your experience and add new scenarios, some of which even exceed the games original campaign. Verdict:	 Although the game is not 100% finished, the graphics and textures are improved, but visually is not especially different to the previous titles, at this point the levels for all factions are quite similar for each campaign, and the stealth missions are a bit redundant.If you are new to the MOW series, or are a fan of them, then I would recommend Assault Squad 2. If you have played early titles such as Assault Squad 1 and it did not leave you wanting more, than this may not be for you, or you may just want to wait for it to go on special to try for yourself.At the end of the day one must remember that this is a game, made for entertainment, and games differ from reality, if you want reality then simply head outside. Have a nice day :)			"

												((EDIT: Now reviewing the RELEASED game:))The MoW games have been some of my favourite RTS ever made - I've been playing them since the original, Soldiers: Heroes of World War II. They have some qualities that I think set them apart from other competing WW2 games. This is to CoH2, for example, what ARMA III is to Metal Slug - except it's fun! The realism does not ruin it.The reason I am NOT recommending it is very simple - nothing has changed! Really, nothing has changed at all! The menu is identical, the sound is identical, almost everything is identical. I actually feel very, very cheated by this - it's actually quite insulting.1) The voice acting is identical, and seeing as it has been used since Faces of War, I'm starting to get a little tired of it. This feels very very lazy.3) The graphics engine does not look anything like the screenshots - in fact, it looks virtually identical to the graphics engine from Men of War AS I. I honestly cannot tell the difference, and I have a computer that can run it on full, easily.4) In order to use units in MP, you have to level up (by playing multiplayer games over a period of time) - meaning, of course, that the best get better and the worst get trashed. You can disable this option, but you have to go into the advanced settings, meaning that many people will overlook this option5) It is still very, very buggy. Frequent crashes to desktop.6) 8v8 games? No. No no, there are 8v8 maps, but you can't actually PLAY with 16 players - you can only put 8 players on. Who wants to play 4v4 on an 8v8 size map?7) The netcode is still atrocious. Good luck finding a large game that runs properly. If a single person in the game has a sluggish computer, it will slow down the entire server for the remaining players. Framerates plummet to the point of unplayability. In fact, I would say that only 25% of the games I have played even play ""playably"".In the end, you have to kick an enormous amount of people with either terrible computers or terrible internet connections. I blame the game for part of this. I'm not sorry I bought this game, especially as I got it reduced, but this feels like a massive cash grab from a lazy company. Which is a shame, because they do know how to make an excellent RTS; or at least, they did once - they've just been re-releasing it for the previous five or so years.Could do better!(P.S. Half the players in this game are apparently Nazis (""S.S. PzDiv"" in their name, pictures of Einsatzgruppen on their steam profile) - the other half seem to want the Soviet Union back.)			"

												If this is your first Assualt Squad, yes it is a fun game.Pros - Decent multiplayer community- Is rather fun for a little while singleplayer-wise- Decent workshop community pumping out plenty of modsCons- Developers seemingly did not and do not listen to customers when we told them what we wanted in this sequel.- A glorified engine upgrade to Assualt Squad 1 that still runs worse and is still not optimized.- Most units and maps are copy/paste from AS1 (Devs even stated not every unit will be remade)- Multiplayer is buggy, laggy, and the MM does not like you.- Missing basic features of nearly every other modern RTS (Non mission skirmish mode for starters)- DLC created to sell you the previously mentioned basic features at insane prices (10$ for Replay ability and 5 small missions!)- DLC apparently prioritized over optimizationAll in all, is it a good game? Yes in its core. But I believe the devs are doing very shoddy work behind it and its a victim of their ineptitude. I may change this review later, based on what the game becomes, but for now I say vote with your wallet, and vote no. "

												Hmm well Men of War Assault Squad 2 is some what disappointing. Being that Assault Squad 2 should not be considered as a new game more like an add-on, expansion or update. if you have Assault Squad 1 play it instead because there's so little that was added only like 5 co-op maps. Now with that out of the way I love WW2 games and the Men of War series as well so the people that do not have Assault Squad 1 I say buy this ""new game"" MOW is one of the best WW2 RTS ever. What was added that i have seen fixes, some maps, steam worckshop, texture updates, (not much of one) audio update, explosions look better, new co-op game play 1 map for each nation (5) and some i can't think of or not worth adding. The reason im not recommending it is because i have Men of War Assault Squad 1.			"

												So yeah. As same opinion as many other curators. It's Probably not deserve to be named sequel, but still a 'Men of War™', a.k.a. most authentic WW2 RTS with strong basis from old ones. If you have enjoyed this franchise or haven't played before, you may feel free to purchase it. (Also it is the only way to play the public PvP multiplayer of MoW series in practice bacause of In-game population matters.)DO NOT PLAY RANKED MATCH if you just here for fun. It's just 'Another screwed-up RTS w/ Unlocks-by-Level system™'. Also haven't gets any better with it's horrible vehicle navigations and skirmish AI at all.(steering, targetting,  name it!) + Also finally, replay system soon to be coming with DLC.++ Wait a second, Improved UI for Deluxe upgrade?

												As it stands, I cannot recommend the game. I am a long time fan of the series, having played since the release of Faces of War quite a few years ago. It is the same gameplay as AS1, except that it is, at least for now (June '14), the lag makes it impossible for me to play MP. As far as I know, this is a common issue and it was certainly not a problem in AS1. As another reviewer said, little more than an update and bad one. "

								This  game have  0 improvements over Assul squad. Sure they say that there are major improvements in engine and all.. but you dont see that, those improvements are to the game engine not to the game. its basically Assult Squad 1.2 . Worth spending money on it? Yes if youre hardcore fan of this series or never played before this type of games, no if you're anybody else.I have question to devs.. how this game is different from MOW? couple years passed and you people keep making same game over and over and over.. another dev team that had 1 idea in their lifetime and keep re-doing it until nobody will buy it i guess?You have the graphic engine? how about adding something new to it? strategy level? no? to hard to think about it?Personally i dont see difference between MOW and Assault Squad 2. Quote from dev blog : ""However, please keep in mind this is not Men of War 2, but Assault Squad 2, so do not expect a totally different game. We never promised such, nor will we "" hehe.. meaning its same garbage game like previous one.Like men of war and assult squad are different much lol.

												I might recommend this game if the developer/producer of this game had actually worked accountably to provide an updated experience to MoW AS... the first one, which is almost exactly the same as the last one. There is very little new material in AS2 that wasn't already there in the first one. Additionally, The first AS is not much different from the first MoW, which wasn't much different from Faces of War. Admittedly, I never played FoW, but its not much different than Soldiers: Heroes of World War II. Go watch a video on youtube and you'll see what I mean.Aside from the fact that I have bought MoW, Red Tide, MoWAS and MoWAS II. The graphics are the same in each. Only a few gameplay features have changed over time.They just released a DLC for $6. I have had it. That should have gone into the MOWAS2 as a free DLC at the least. The devs are not accountable. You have to try really hard to imagine even a single person developing full time for DMS.			"

Early Access Review
								I purchased this title under the impression that it would be as the title suggests: a sequal to Digital Mindsoft's Men of War: Assault Squad (MOWAS). I am, however and unfortunately, extremely disappointed to say the least.Having not played MOWAS in a few months, I found it near impossible to actually tell this was supposed to be a different game; graphically, feature-wise and gameplay-wise it is identical to its predecessor, with the same game modes, same copy-pasted maps, same voice acting, same units -- everything is, effectively, the same. Rather than enjoying a new game with fresh new features, some kind of gameplay innovation or even simply new units, I found myself playing the same game I'd played two years ago when the first MOWAS was released.I can not stress enough not to bother purchasing this game. It contains a couple of new maps, but they are bland and follow the same formula as the previous game; everything else is identical, or of a pointless enough nature to be indistinguishable. If you own MOWAS already, you are missing nothing by not playing MOWAS 2.			"

												This is outdated but the only difference between now and then is more problems with things. ( Also sorry for my bad grammer and other mistakes I wrote this at 11pm : P ) (I SAY THIS WITH A GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME IN GAME)  Early on when this game was release it was alot of fun and a good game, but not the game has gotten to a postion were you either pay for stupid pointless DLC or you mod the game.              After one of the newest DLC getting intoduced with the new Bots in multiplayer I finaly gave up on the developers , I can under stand they need money and this is a easy way to make it, but there are many more options that can give the people what some of us have been waiting for for a very long time ( I Have been waiting for bots in muti-player ever sence the first MOW game ).              In conclusion at this moment of writing this I have alot more respect for the Modding community then the dev's of this game, the stupid fast money tactics they are implimenting are normaly lacking in content and paid mods probably would be a cheaper and better option ( Never thought I would say that XD ).              I would suggest only buying this game for the mods now and only put money in to the mod community thro donations.( This is a bit out dated , the only difference is that ALOT ALOT of people cant get mods working any more and the Unmoded game Crashes ALOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT )			"

								Don't bother buying this for single player.  Until it leaves beta stage, verytime they update it, it invalidates all of you save games.  Brilliant.... unless you like playing from scratch every time.Truely awful that its been released like this.  Supposedly it was due to be released as a full game and then a week before the date, it changed to release as a beta.  Really anoying as i was a big fan of MOW1.  This is buggy, pre-release rubbish.

												Have been playing Men of War Assault Squad before, which was awsome... apart from the fact that you couldn't use all different tanks and units in skirmish and I sucked at multiplayer. The previous game would hit easily an 8 out of 10 for me. However, this game doesn't do good. My tanks get shot from several directions and they just sit there doing nothing. You can however manual mark the targets, and they hit them very well, but auto fire seems to be bugged heavily. Also counts for mortars. Multiplayer is under populated at this point. Not the game I was hoping for.			"

								They call this Assault Squard 2, but this game basicly is Assault Squard 1 with updated UI, some new model, and re-worked campaign(which still sucks anyway). You can barely find anything new in this updated version of AS1. this is bullshxt, developer these day lose their faith and passion on game developing but became money vacuumed & blood sucking vampire.Men of War used to be a great strategy game, it points a new way of how to make a realistic WWII strategy game playable and fun. Yes it does lack of great voice acting in singleplayer campaign, but at least present us a actual story line but not this kind of ""general thank goood you have arrrrived"" thing. It's just lame.I suggest anyone who is new to this franchise stick with original Men of war; MoW: Red Tidd; MoW: vietnam. Even Condemned Heroes were better than this. If you interested in multiplayer, Assault Squard 1 was enough for you. Buy this only if you don't even borther to try any of the other Men of War games or while it's 90% off.Im dead fkin serious!Update: After Men of War Assault Squard 2 last update, it seems the game finally got its full release, but you wanna know how lazy they are? they even re-using original assault squard tutorail as bounes mission in AS2! How genius! Not to metion, all campaign mission they add up last update belongs to original Assault squard, too, and of couse with abusolute no change.			"

												For all those who enjoy the plethora of games based on the greatest tale of the Twentieth Century, heres a few things I've picked up from playing this game:Graphics: 6/10; The games getting along in its time since the time of writing this review, but I try to keep things in mind like when the game was made, as it can be quite easy to look at an older game which at the time had outstanding definition but compared to modern games falls by the wayside. MoW:AS2 has rather detailed units that all manage to be unique, from the color of their uniform, to weapons, shadow casting all very solid. The damage of weapons fire against structures and enemy vehicles is realistic and believable, and many are designed to react accordingly when shot with enough large caliber rounds (structures crumble and fall, sandbags break and disintigrate, rocks chip and crack). All of it holds up quite well for its time. Sometimes however excessive particle effects such as fires or multiple launch rocket strikes can slow the game down briefly.Gameplay: 7/10; The sheer fact that the game has some of the most realistic reactions when it comes to combat compared to many (But not all) other RTS games is quite a feat, infantry must be managed carefully, and well-placed machine guns can cut your squad apart if not handled well. The game promotes good command, rewarding units with veternacy and better efficiency if theyre allowed to survive, and requires the player to think like a field commander might, scanning the map and wondering to themselves, ""If I were them, would -I- put an Anti-Tank gun there?"". In another interesting twist, it accomodates for cooperative activity as well, with multiple players all sharing command of units, transferring them between each other allowing you to split tactics evenly on the battlefield. The game makes room for some tactical stealth operations as well, however they are a bit, twitchy, and careful strategy and deployment can make them not require as much stealth as may have been intended. Lastly, combined arms are a must, as well as managing each units supplies, which will be covered in a moment...Sound: 6/10; The volume in the game is well put-together, and weapons sound as they should. Varying levels of bass and procussion depending on what size and caliber of weapon is being fired, as well as explisives. Grenades have a satisfying if short lived -crump-, while large caliber, 203mm B-4's have a crashing explosion as it redecorates the landscape. Sound varies nicely when you zoom in and out. For some of the single player Scenarios, the voice actors are rather sub-par however all sounding as though they were voiced by only one or two different VA's, however the gameplay does make up for this shortcoming, as you don't need to listen to them too often.Addictiveness and Depth: 8/10; Whoo, well if you want depth this is definitely the game for it. To start, the game is intensely realistic, this goes beyond knowing your men will be mowed down if they charge an emplaced machine gun nest, and into the world of logistics. Every man has its own inventory, and its up to the player to ensure that they stay supplied with weapons, medical equipment, ammunition, and special tools for certain tasks. Corpses of fallen enemies (Or comrades) can be looted for ammo and guns, and a smart commander can take full advantage of an enemy's mistake, perhaps the Germans giving up a Panzershreck to a British rifleman section, giving them a powerful anti-tank deterrent and saving the commander from having to deploy his own. Daunting at first, there are shortcuts as while each man can be supplied individually, moving the squad to ammo trucks, or having the squad leader scavenge bodies and vehicles will provide supplies to the whole unit making things easier. Keeping your units well outfitted with a variety of weapons is also important as no one unit is capable of everything, and you must support your tanks with infantry, taking into account enemy positions and equipment. The game can be incredibly fun to play as give and take happens on both sides of the battlefield, and varying game modes (As well as some from mods with a nod to Sir Hinkel's AS missions), which provide plenty to do and attempt.Overall: 7/10; The game is fun, engaging, and provides a great platform for tactical thinking, rewarding skillful maneuvers with that ""Finally!"" feeling when a particularly tough obstacle is removed, especially when the game throws a few surprises in during some of the Scenario missions, which can throw some serious wrenches into the works. A fun game to pick up for both single and multi-player gaming, especially among friends, as some of the sorties you can engage in will offer abundant challenge for all players involved.			"

												Now now, ladies and gentlemen - You are looking at one of the greatest World War 2 strategy games of all times! Why? Let me tell You all about it. Pros:*In this game - Your choices actually matter. Outcome of the battle can change very quickly depending on Your commands - having even twice as much infantry units can mean nothing if they are pushed forward against tanks or HMGs - unlike in CoH (Company of Heroes franchise) there are no heroes here - that means You can't just take a lot of infantry and push them directly to the heart of the battle and suspect them to succeed easily, because if they are away from cover - they are dead. Or likely to become in mere moments. *Balanced armies - You get what You pay. In this game You won't find a cheap unit that is too hard to deal with - all vehicles die quickly against right anti-armour tools, meaning the light units will explode instantly if hit by high caliber weapons. More expensive units mostly have longer range, slightly better armour, but still have to be used carefully.*Partial realism - this game tries to be as realistic as possible and still be fun to play. Now let's get to the ugly part.Cons:* A.I. is horrible. Some units commit suicide if left unchecked - they might flip themselves over some obstacle and explode. Other units will take worst possible route. Others will not obey Your commands the first time they get them.*Graphics are bad. Not very bad, but can be better - now they look like something from 2009.* Hard to learn to play - there are a lot of things to discover in this game. There's so much of them, it's almost impossible, because there are almost no in-game ability descriptions.Conclusion:If You got bored by CoH franchise - give this game a shot. You will probably like it a lot. Some aspects of MoW:AS2 are so good, they beat CoH! But there are many of flaws too, Imperfect, yet fun and very unique.			"

												Men of War Assault squad 2 (or just MOW) is in mine and many other Men Of War fans opinion the best RTS ever made and especially in comparison to games that got much greater acclaim (company of heroes) -criminally underrated. It is very much a realistic RTS in that tactics are very similar to how they were on a real WW2 battlefield.  I have 520 hours on the game and bear in mind I have been playing this game since the first Men of War was released.   MOW is at least compared to games such as company of heroes very realistic.  On tanks  for example there are no silly health bars to pound away at, and if you want to destroy a tank that is too powerful there are a number of options. Get behind him, flank him, or send in a commando with a rocket or grenade. That one man slowly crawling towards your hated online enemy (and in MOW while playing and especially losing you will despise your enemy!) can decide the whole outcome of the battle. Winning a battle especially against a smug but accomplished friend can leave you on a high all day and losing make you feel terribly bitter! Infantry is realistic too each soldier will have his powers and weaknesses but all soldiers caught out in the open will be obliterated if they come up against an enemy who is well dug in. In MOW it pays to be patient and keep calm but as the anger rises when things go wrong people tend to lose their heads and just charge their enemies neck throwing everything they possibly can at their opponent. This is a sure-fire way to lose and although fortune does indeed very often favour the brave and daring initiative you really do have to carefully think about what you are doing and surprise your enemy.  Very much like real war a good commander will have a good temperament and not be irritated or angered by his opponent keep calm and react well to his enemies’ choices.  I on the other had am more prone to raging buffoonery! One of the most important things in MOW is to control the map and have eyes everywhere and therefore know in advance everything your enemy is up too. A good opponent though will know this too and you will probably end up in a bitter struggle for every inch of earth! When you start up a MP game you will know very quickly the sort of opponent you are up against. Noobs will stay in there one precious flag attempting to turn it into their own personal Maginot line but good players will attack everywhere at once. Playing a good player can be soul destroying and you will think back lovingly to the last noob you crushed belatedly realizing how hollow your own sense of omnipotence had been. In MOW there are some seriously good players and a thousand different strategies.    MOW is a game in which you must make choices and react appropriately to your enemies’ choices. There are countless variations of playstyles -aggressive and defensive- and online you will encounter many different people and nationalities who will employ many different styles of play and battle tactics.  For example Chinese players play very well and very defensively. Defensive tactics work terribly for many of us MOW veterans but the Chinese can make it work. They have a system of which each step seems to have been meticulously worked out before hand and they don’t tend to deviate from the plan seeming to have a fastidious understanding of the tank positioning they are using as well as the armour and penetration statistics etc.   Honestly it’s the best RTS ever made in my opinion but online it’s also one of the most white knuckle and tensest gaming experiences I have ever had. A real heart in the mouth experience especially when playing a close friend it can often actually be a little bit too tense, but when you want to relax and have fun you can play 2v2 or 3v3 with other people.If you have never played this game before I highly recommend buying Men Of War Assault Squad origins as you will get the original single player campaign (an excellent campaign btw) as well as all of the MOW AS 2 multiplayer components but upgraded to the modern graphics engine. In short despite the fact it was always ignored by the mainstream media best RTS ever made and many people in the community agree with me. If only more RTS developers would follow its example.  "

												If you have played men of war series this game is for you.And if you played Soldiers Heroes of World War 2; Face of war or just very similar game like these you will probably like this.This game is similar to Arma series but everything is in strategy. For example of realism and unreplaylebility once you lose battle in the same load you can load it back and then your squad may survive your enemy attack or maybe even to contra attack after attack. You can win whole game with one soldier if you are ,,very lucky,, (i mean very ... very lucky..)All explosions, flying parts can hurt or kill your units... Blast waves can throw your soldiers away and knock them out too so me careful in this game!!!About soldiers/vehicles/buildings:1.They have inventories (not whole squad i mean all your squad members have their own inventories)2.All dead bodies, cars can be looted if you need something.3.All vehicles can be repaired and used for yourself. (Yes you can steal enemy cars, tanks and ect. )4.All vehicles have their parts, some of them can be very easily destroyable and some of them not. In this game you dont care about health you care about your strategy and luck of avoid enemy shells and bullets...5.All vehicles can be destroyed and lose their parts. (Parts can flew off to difrent locations)6.If you loose part i mean its not broken but you totaly lost it... You can you can't glue it and fix it like this.7.Mostly of buildings can as cover (if its not wooden becouse wood isnt very good protection)8.Yes you can go in buildings. (you can hide in it and you can do ambushes form it)9. Buildings can be destroyed and you can make holes in them too. My verdict about this game:1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must play "

												I have been extremely disappointed in the unprofessional and, in my opinion, very underhanded treatment of the purchasers of Digital Mind Soft's (DMS) Assault Squad 2 (AS2). The game had been advertised as a pre-order for a sequel to their first Assault Squad game with a lot of promised features. Myself and many other players purchased this pre-order under the assumption that DMS intended to meet this expectation. In order to be brief, DMS has fallen very short of their advertisement. They even went as far to change their game type from pre-order to ""Early Access"" when they failed to meet their release date twice. Suffice to say, we the customers are very upset and wish to share our disgust. The developers at DMS have chosen to bring on a community manager who makes it his business to completely remove any/all comments posted which even hints at disappointment in their decision to change the game to being ""Early Access"" at the last second. They have even began censoring all comments, reviews, or chat, that expresses any dissatisfaction in their product at all! Please take an administrative interest in the AS2 Steam forum. Like I said, many customers like myself feel that it is completely unethical for DMS to exercise this level of censorship. We are justified in being dissatisfied and have an obligation to voice this dissatisfaction to deter DMS from completely ostracizing the AS2 community.  DMS is clearly showing a complete lack in ability to plan and execute the launch of their new product, including proper risk mitigation.  It's a wonder that 1C can continue to support their fly-by-night software development practices.  This game barely has all the features that the first game had and is extremely glitchy and unplayable.  Stay away, you've been warned.			"

												Horrible! Unbelievable that they would re-release this as a new game. It's exactly, EXACTLY!!! the same as the original Assault Squad. Complete rip-off and a waste of time and money. I will never buy a game from this studio or these developers again.			"

												Well, where to start.....I have every Men of War game, including the lame Red Tide and limited Vietnam. What about MoWAS2?It is actually a very POOR revamp of the original game, you may ask why?I have started the USA campaign, only to find its actually the first game only worse.You can't move the map, the game stutters like its having a fit.The stupid vehicle run into everything going and flip over rendering them useless.The other games had a unload option, this doesn't, the map options appear to be limited.This is not a singeplayer aimed game its actuallly more geared to get everyone online to battle it out.I have nothing against online battles, but they could have actually come up with something new, they haven't.Very disappointed...almost wish I hadn't bought this now, ok there may the odd different mission further in the campaigns, but this isn't enough. Whats happened to the originallity of the other games?Whats with the stupid icons over the top of the units? They only get in the way, so when you click on a unit you end up with a unit you never collected......please !!!So to recap...nothing but a revamp with awful attempts to add things that become unwanted,....I'm going back to the original MoW and MoWAS at least the developers tried to do something...unless things change, its been a waste of money and the game will probably just sit in my library unplayed.DISSAPOINTED MoW fan....

												If you are new and interested in single player and COOP, then for the price of AS2 you can get AS1, MoW and Red Tide.  Just look for sales on the Net. Those games come with highly recommended mods, so make sure you look for them.  AS2 has very limited new content: it has all AS1 missions, plus  3 new missions (3 same scripts copied and pasted 5 times over to make an illusion of 15 new missions). I didn't buy this game for new content, but because I wanted to play MP. If you are into PvP, then I would recommend waiting until they (1.) fix performance because it is very laggy and frustrating; (2)  fix matchmaking, which is easily exploitable, unbalanced due to unfair progression system and played on many unfair maps.  Pls, ask about performace and matchmaking on the forum before buying this game. In terms of gameplay,  I would say it is not bad but it failed to improve upon AS1. Shorter ranges and changed penetration values made lots of units less useful, if not useless, esp. light armoured TDs. What really affects gameplay are maps. Ranked maps lack consistency: intead of reducing player count for each map systematically, they decided to make, for example, Urban Garden playable for 1v1s and 2v2s. Moreover, 2v2 maps range from tiny maps like Tramwayz  or Urban Garden to very big  like Lakeland or Town. Maps badly need more steamlining. We only got  7 new MP maps: one 1x1, two 2x2 and four 3x3 or 8x8 depending on the mode you play. Good news is that they are not bad. Another thing that seems to help with gameplay is new interface.  I find the new interface a bit better and I like the smg, rifle and MG icons for infantry. Double clicking on one unit will select same units within camerea view. But the grenade/TNT timers are aweful.All in all, I recommend patience. We've been waiting for this game to get fixed for 6 months now. So there is no telling when the dream patch will come out. But when it comes out, I hope to see you in the battefield, because well-matched games on  good maps can be really exciting.			"

												Fun game, awesone serries.Wrecked by lag.If you do not have a high performance computer, don't buy this game. You will not enjoy the jerking camera, the non responsive units, delayed commands, mission critical units doing as they please, units destroied not by stupidity or cunning, but buy lag.In short, my comp runs at an average of 1.5x better than the reccomended specs and the game now runs like ♥♥♥♥.The updates have made things worse, and support tickets have not resoved any issues when they have been finnally answered.The problem persists across a number of people I play with and should you purchase the game be aware that single player and lan are the only options - internet multiplayer doesn't work consistantly and people drop from games if it takes too long to load/ sync/ place first unit - and I should mention they dont have a choice (the game does it for you, even if you were first to load with highest performance)on the whole, go back to the origional men of war.

												Just bought the game cause the videos und the pics looked good, so I thought... but honestly this game for 30 Euros is just a very bad joke. Graphic sucks (empire earth1), many clipping bugs, mission is always ""conquer the area"", .. if you do so you'll get armored vehicles like tanks, then go on and on and on...without any story.By the way you can order as many units you want ,in case they die. - that is absolutely nonrealistic, you don't need any resources anyway. That makes this game really boring very soon. You don't need tactis also ,cause you have unlimited units.so once you realised that you throw them to the opponent and reorder some new when they died.Other bad thing are the maps.. they always look similar. Your ways to attack the opponent is quite set cause of the tight maps, you haven't much abilitys like to attack the opponents back. Sound is also from very older days, it's hard to seperate gun shots from tank shots. My opinion: the game ain't worth any money.I'm upset cause i wasted so much money. Absolutely not comparable to Company of Heroes, I really never never played such a bad strategic game... I really don't know where all the good reviews come from..			"

												Most of what I saw might not make sense to somebody who has not played the original, but it needs to be said.First off, the optimization is horrible. On the same graphics level as the original MoW: AS, it somehow manages to run worse. In the original MoW: AS, I managed to make 40+ FPS on Medium. In this, I can make perhaps 10-15 on the lowest of all settings, somehow still looking far worse than MoW: AS. It seems to have traded my frames for a /shiny/ interfacy and oh-so-fancy squad icons.Secondly, the AI 'improvements' are actually downgrades. I am serious. I have seen my guys go into battle with no ammo in their weapns despite having an inventory full of it. They don't seem to see the need to reload until they are half a meter from the enemy. There is also no option to reload them for the selected unit, when there used to be. It was valuable.Units seem to have epileptic fits trying to target opjects and move around, whilst vehicle turn in circles whilst trying to pathfind around bushes. 'look into' and 'target' commands for infantry takes seconds to register, while the AI for the enemy launches precision-guided grenades and wields sniper Submachineguns, neither of which you shall ever be able to repeat.Soldiers hop out of cover and stand in the open at the slightest provication, and refuse to lay down on the damned ground when the 'stance' button is pressed.The maps added are tiny, even for the 8v8 ones, and are something that a beginner to the editor could reproduce in an hour of work. They are also incredibly uninspired: Half of the time, they seem copied wholesale from other maps, whilst half a dozen train tracks were moved elsewhere, and some sandbags added.The map view is also seriously wrong. Allies in white? I can't tell where half of them are. And incoming/outgoing fire seems far smaller now, leading to moments of confusion as I try to figure out where any fighting is at.The only good thing I can see in this is Steam Workshop support, and even that is pathetic if I can't even play the game correctly.I feel bad that my friend bought this for me, even if I didn't pay a cent. I also feel bad for every single person who is new to the series who buys this, thinking that 'newer is better'. It's not, and this ain't.Buy the first game. Hell, buy Men of War: Vietnam... THAT train wreck is better than this. Unless this undergoes quite a few updates to improve optimization, add additional content, and actually MAKE it a new game, I will not be recommending this to any of my friend.EDIT:A few months later, I have a few more comments about it.You shouldn't even think of buying this sold-as-a-full-game DLC. Devs are greedy. It's basically the same as Assault Squad one, except you have to unlock units in multiplayer, the AI is more ♥♥♥♥, the game runs terribly, and they have added bots to online... As $10 DLC.They have precisely the same levels as the previous one, with a few more tiny, token maps added, ones that are poorly designed in my opinion.This is garbage, and I would fully recommend the previous Men of War. Even if you can't do regular online because the Devs didn't bother keeping servers online after Gamespy shut down in order to force people into this, you can at least have fun.			"

												The ""game"" is simulation. If you've ever wondered how a King Tiger provoked nothing but terror, what a Bofors cannon would do to a village, or how the MG-42 ambushed it's prey, well this game's for you. It's as graphically stunning as it is enlightening. I've learned more about mid century warfare from this game than any predecessor.  The amount of tools and tanks you get at your disposal leaves nothing to desire. Learn how mortars and MGs compliment each other and utilize single soldiers at the touch of a key. In this game there is ""no god"" or little to no random number generating. If you don't like how a unit is performing hit a key and micromanage it to victory. Hammer windows with high explosive tank rounds and push into crippled landscapes with your wily storm troopers. The games not at fault, the hick-ups lie in the animations and AI. These should not deter your purchase. This game is striving for the moon in realism. It's essentially a WW2 sandbox with a decent campaign and extremely fun multiplayer.When you Play Men of War: Assault Squad 2 you feel as tho you can relate to Rommel. The struggle is real. Those generals had a lot of variables to consider, and now so do you.			"

												Assault Squad 2 is the closest thing to a scam that I have seen on Steam. The whole reason for its existence was to be running on a new engine, with the benefits of better performance and visuals. I was willing to accept this as the only real improvement over the previous MoW games, and that honestly would have been enough for me. However, this game runs just as poorly, if not worse than older games, and hardly looks any better. So not only did the performance never change, everything else has been copy-pasted from the old games. I didn't expect a new game, but I expected a playable game. No matter what kind of hardware you have, it runs horribly. You will be lucky to get a constant 30 fps on a Titan. It actually makes the game unplayable for me, and probably for most people. So without successfully changing anything from Assault Squad 1, these guys re-released it with a number 2 on it actually and have the balls to charge $35 for it! Oh and don't even get me started on the whole early access bait and switch. Products like this are foreshadowing a rather bleak future for Steam in general. I cannot believe Valve are letting companies get away with such fraud.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm so disappointed with this game after a good review I was convince to buy it coz i'm fan of   RTS (simulation, war base) game so I bought it to play and feel like cheated the review seems of scale but the game experience really the opposite.There isn't real skirmish in game everything seems a mission, campaign on  different faction has all similar mission just been modified little bit it's really a  bit annoying no thought giving on it. It's no challenge and not innovative.  it's still buggy and always giving me out of memory  on my game and I have good hardware lol.I can't seems find aswell opponent on multiplayer not sure maybe because im in southeast asia? and few player or it feels like ♥♥♥♥?  The opposite there is a lot of workshop mission and map but right now? I cant recommend it not sure why I bother to bought it without downloading crack version to test it before getting ♥♥♥♥ off... haiz.			"

												EDIT: This review was made before the shut down of gamespy so therefore it was obvious that we could just go back and play Assault Squad 1, however we can't do this anymore. So unfortunatly the multiplayer is still quite 'broken' in AS2 compared to predecessors. However they have improved it a lot since launch, for example you can manage to play a least a 2v2 now. I have always been a huge Men of War fan. I own and played every single Men of War released and never got tired of them. Even when people were dissapointed with Men of War Vietnam I still loved it.When I saw a Men of War Assault Squad 2 coming out I was so excited. I already pumped 400+ hours into the first Assault Squad cause I loved playing it so much. When I got AS 2 and started to play, it was a disaster. The game only adds two or three new units and is a horrible remake of the original Assault Squad. Due to random lag spikes the game is barly playable more than a 3v3 in the multiplayer and lets not even mention the de syncs! Getting disconnected mid game is simply unacceptable for a full fledged game in 2016! With the new implemented idea of units needing to be unlocked once you reach a certain level makes the game unbalanced and unrealistic. Also the graphics are a tad better only for mainstream factions. For example, the Japanese vehicals look like they are ports from Assault Squad 1, same with a few other vehicals in the game, not retextued at all. I can guarantee this is not worth it's current price. Getting it on sale for $10 or under sure. Nevertheless, it is an alright game game, it has to be because it's the exact same thing as the first one. But overall, I don't know about you guys, but I wouldn't pay $35 for a reskin. Coming to a conclusion, I realize this game is a step in the wrong direction. The unit lock by levels, the auto resupply, the WAY overpriced DLC... it seems DMS is copying the ways of it's rival, Company of Heroes 2. We are loosing what makes the Men of War franchise unique and this game shows it. At least we are not to far gone and can still make a return of the original feeling of Men of War.			"

												This game is my absolute favorite speaking of rts games. it comes with all the options someone could ask for.great map/mission editor inclusive.You can have massive battles with tons of tanks and arty,you can also have infantry squad based, storydriven stealhgameplay in which you e.g. need to lead a group of airbornes to infiltrate a german flakbase.You can also have both at the same time.to top it all, the   multiplayer   is great. its possible to launch an 8vs8 battle, though, it can causeserious lags and performance drops - depending on the match's option ofc. 2vs2, 3vs3 or 4vs4 is no problem most of the times. gamemodes are battlezones (in which you need to capture flagzones, if you keep more than the enemy,your team will gain points). combat (in which you get points for destroying enemy units)and some variations of those. you can set the options like how high the pointscap will be, the maximum of how many troops someone can call in or lead at once, etc all yourself.hundrets of different vehicles and units like mortars, mgs, howitzers are awaiting you. the   content   is amazing. mods will deliver you even more, high detailed units or even whole factions.  micromanagment   is a big thing in this game, though you dont need to take care of each soldiers inventory (yes, thats actually possible). every soldier has a name, skills and his job. you would need to control a soldier to throw a nade into a good spot here and then, but most of the times you will find yourself controlling your favorite tank and hunt down others in direct mode.speaking of   direct mode  , its the thing which seperates it from other ww2 rts games most, imo. you can, if you want, control single units in WASD mode, use the weapon or other items (even throwing knives for the fun of it). nothing is more satisfying than hitting an enemy tank into its ammo depot (the game is doing a great job in hitboxes) in direct mode, causing a huge explosion which will destroy the buildings around it, including the snipers in them. mmh. feels gud man. if you want to make a map yourself, do it. the   editor   is a quite easy tool to make super detailed maps, waiting to get released on the workshop. there are plenty tutorials on youtube or on communityhub. i have created a few of them my own, its worth to get the game only for checking out my incredible beautiful maps.the   mods   will let this game staying alive for long long time. star wars, realism mods, a mod in which you play the sp campaing of call of duty mw2, terminator mod schwarzenegger style, mods which will let you explore the modern war or just simple skinpacks or soundpacks - all available here on steamworkshop.easy installation and setup.if you now think   ""meh, all i was asking for is a simple rts game""  , its simple if you want. a simple rts game in which you can call in infantry and tanks to destroy the opposingarmies and conquer some ground. but you can go deeper if you like. alot more deeper. and its always better to go deeper no homo.if you want to learn more, about the details or whatever, feel free to send me a friendsrequest here on steam. o/			"

												Single player of Assault Squad series are lacking the depth of the original Men of War games and expansions, but can be played with a friend in coop mod. Multiplayer, however, aint working that well.The game carries the same engine since 2006 and the issues of this engine are traveling with it. It seems like that to play this game properly everyone who runs it should have good performance and connection and even if one player got lags or fps drops - everyone will suffer from it. And from my expirience that happens in every game. And even if you assume it runs OK for everybody you have a game where you have to control a lot of units and the game doesnt offer you enough means to do that like other strategy or tactic games.It might be worth it to get it on -75% sale, but pay the full price for that? No.I wish i could give this game a positive review, but until this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ peer-to-peer connection method exist i wont. Even Relic managed to get rid of it.			"

												First of all, it might seem like I know nothing (like John Snow) at first sight. I've played all of the Men of War series and the elder ones of this game just not in this account. So please read:If you like WWII and RTS like me buy it. But:Do NOT buy it if you want a solid, story rich campaign. If you want that, buy Men of War. If you also don't mind old games, I would also recommend playing the ancestors of this series Soldiers and Faces of War.This game is based on Multiplayer gaming. Do NOT buy it if you don't want that. It only has Skirmish missons as Single Player.(Which I also enjoy playing)This game, like all of the ones in the series, have bugs. But only minor bugs.

												1) Start the singleplayer game2) Clear the first couple of enemy positions with no real problems3) Get overconfident and lose half your men to a single machinegun position hidden in a bush4) Ah! I see how this works now.5) Spend hours carefully blowing up AI positions with mortars and heavy tanks6) Definitely know how this works.

												I've always loved the MOW series and I've always loved the series. But for some reason, this game looks exactly like the first one. The only thing really special about it is more single player missions, and mods, but trust me, these mods aren't exactly an ""amazing"" thing. I always played with mods on my game, until one day the  ""Sir Hinkels Maps"" mods broke my game. So, typically I haven't been able to play it in over months. Also, multiplayer isn't any different either! It looks exactly like Men of War Assault Squad! Honestly, I see nothing special in this game. For one, the mods can break the game very eaisly (if you have more then 1 mod activated) aswell as it looking EXACTLY like the first title. So no, I wouldn't recommend this game.			"

												Once in a while I enjoy playing War Sim Strategy games. I think this is a nostalgia thing from the old days when I was LAN Red Alert 2 with friends. This is a pretty interesting War Sim Strategy game. The graphics were decent, military history, i.e Weapons, Vehicles etc. seem accurate, which isn't always the case with games like this. I found it enjoyable. It is real time, not turn based, and you have to juggle multiple units, which are usually under engagement at the same time, scattered across the map. I would play this again and recommend a try for anyone who wants to play a decent War Sim Strategy at a low cost.			"

												I bought this game twice, and feel scammed.  It's basically the exact same game as Assault SquadProof.  http://imgur.com/a/OGl1lCan't tell the difference? Good.  You're paying for the 'privilage' to use multiplayer since gamespy shut down Digital Mindsoft stopped supporting the superior first game and used this sad excuse of an 'upgrade'  to make a quick buck.   Multiplayer uses some halfassed steam support which has no inclusive chat lobby and therefore cannot retain a playerbase which was a concern for the first game but a killer for this one.  Design decisions made such as unit locking/leveling and obvious timer displays for grenades were implemented to cater to CoH players and make the transition for them easier but served as an annoyance and dumbing down of the core game for me.  But,  don't dare criticize the game or you will be censored, hard.  Observe ban reason.  http://imgur.com/a/gFufq  Update 06/10/2014 decided to give it a go again for posterity.   During 'early' access the game was laggy, it still is.  There's a reason there's no one online playing it right now. i7-3770K  NVIDIA GTX 670, 8 gigs of ram, no reason for it to run like this other than bad coding.oh, want to save and watch game replays?  cough up another $12 for the DLC that allows you to do that.Update 9/6/2014 - still terrible.Update 10/18/2014 - still terrible.Update 01/11/2015 - still terrible.Update 02/03/2015 - about where it should have been at release			"

Early Access Review
								The game is extremly fun. Multiplayer is as fun as ever and single player is a lot more branched out......for a whole 3 missions. Then theres a repeat of the old assault squad missions combined wiht the fact that the game randomly crashes for NO REASON i cant recommend this game also there's two missing factions which is inexcusable to me to even be a factor. I understand what Early access is but to not even have all the factions completed is unacceptable. This is a game for fans of the series who know how to tolerate the missing aspect of the game but enjoy the new and fun aspects to the game. As for everyone else i cant recommend this.			"

												It's a very strange game. It's good, but bad at the same time. Well, not bad but it does have it's share of flaws. The gameplay is really good, it's very in-depth and tactical, if you ever learn how to play it. There's almost no tutorial at all, you have to go into the controls settings and learn them yourself. The graphics are great, the sound is amazing, and the gameplay is fluid. What it lacks is a good story, a good tutorial and a good singleplayer. Even though most MoW fans mainly play multiplayer, 1C could have stepped it up more on the singleplayer. The story is really dull. Probably the biggest flaw to this game is how similar it is to MoW:AS1, which was an amazing game. It would seem that a game that is similar to it's predecessor would be equally as good, but somehow this is worse. I reccomend it, but MoW:AS1 is just a whole lot better.			"

												Digital Mindsoft is one of the most disgusting development companies I have ever experienced. The game has major issues and should not have been released. It is still in beta. Releasing when it did killed the community. I wanted better performance both for multiplayer and just in general, better graphics, more maps, more units, etc. We got like 2 new maps, graphics are the same, and performance is worse than MoWAS1. We also got a lame leveling system to unlock units and lost hundreds if not thousands of players in the process.This should have been a free patch because the only reason it was ""created"" was the old multiplayer hositng was shut down.  There is nothing in this game to make it a sequel or version 2.  It is the same game, but worse in numerous ways. I am extremely disappointed in Digital Mindsoft as I love this game, but it is just so poorly executed and unpolished it ruins playing it.			"

												I really want to like this game. It could be way better than company of heroes in that its more realistic, focuses more on actual combat, way more variety of units especially tanks, more countries to play as and so on. Unfortunately everytime I play it doesn't take long until I get annoyed and frustrated with it. If the developers can fix some of these issues with the game it will severely improve the experience. Here are my reasons I dislike this game:1. The vehicle pathfinding is really frustrating. The vehicles will often drive into trees and get stuck, or take the most illogical routes through a village possible.2. Tanks are pratically useless. Forget the terrifying panzers feared by allied infantry during ww2, because in this game almost all infantry can just spam attack them with AT grenades and destroy them instantly.3. There is no notification that your units are under attack. This always happens to my defended positions. The game doesn't tell you anything, I will often look away for 10 seconds and look back and all my squads are dead.4. Smoke grenades are useless. I don't know what their current in game function is but the certainly dont provide cover from enemy machinegunners.5. The infantry ai are really dumb. I don't feel like I'm commanding real soldiers, but instead stiff robotic drones that require me to tell them to duck when under fire or move away when a grenade is right at their feet. Apparently none of these soldiers have instincts or basic training. They often will run straight into enemy fire for no reason and get killed when trying to throw a grenade rather than crawl, and take forever to fire a rocket launcher at a tank, usually just standing there frozen.6. Some of the specialty units suck. When I saw you could get paratroppers I assumed you could drop them in behind enemy lines, but instead the just spawn exactly where everything else does. Kind of a let down.			"

												I've now managed to rack up 136hrs on this game, yet I haven't regreted a minute of it. The extensive detail in the models, landscape and particle effects, enables this game to come to life with its realistic qualites. The game has also a good length campagn with multiple missions for each of the 5 factions. Each of these missions will take up through my experince a minimum of 30min. MoW have also included online gamplay adding more depth to the game if you enjoy the more socail and interactive parts. The multiplayer is similar yet different where the gamplay is more fast paced. I find it is more stratigic as you are competing against another person and relies more on points you earn via holding objectives. It reminds me off other games such as Dawn of War and Company of Heroes, yet I would argue this is a far better game.MoW have also included an Editor section of the game where you are given the power to do what anything you want whith the extense options and diverstiy of viechles and units. This is where I have spent most of my time and probably my favorite part of the game. This 'sandbox' is what I think distinguishies this from any other similar genres. And this alone would be a reason why I would urge you to purchase it. The game was launched in 2014 and boy it could have been launched now and still I would be inpressed by what the creatures have done with this game. Definatly worth £19.99 and as it is the halloween sale whilst I'm reviewing why ould not spend £4.99!?However their are aspects which I do not necessarly agree on, this includes: The fireing range of the figures and their awarness to their surroundings (hopefully this shall be worked upon in future MoW games), the programing and use of planes and boats and the hitpoints the figures have been programed with. - Firing range and awarness. If you find this slightly anoying as I do their are mods such as Robs Realism mod which perfects the game (in my opinion) giving greater firing range and awarness to the units. However I do feel that the MoW need to work on how the units use the environment to flank, hide behing cover and retreat/advance.- Planes and boats.This is another aspect of the game im slightly upset by as this would of been revolutionary if they managed to pull this off. If they made using planes and boats as easy as using tanks and units it would of made this game even better and definatly a must buy (not saying that its not). For example if the ai could controll the planes or boats, and maybe a deeper and more critiqual look to the detail in the sky maybe a view where you can see dog fights happening and another view like the one there is already installed in the game?-Hitpoints and Hitboxes.This is my last criticism of the game, even though this is a minor point I would of prefered if the units had hitboxes for certain parts of their body. e.g. Headshot = double damage and leg = half damage etc... However these are minor things and shouldnt sway your decision for not investing your time and money.I hope this has helped any prospective buyers or anyone just interested or have the game. "

												This game is fantastic. I'll never have enough words to fully describe how much I love it.PROS:- Graphics are incredibly good, tanks look very realistic.- MANY types of vehicles and infantry to spawn and control.- The game is hard,even when you're fighting the AI.- THE GAME IS ACTUALLY HARD (unless you play on easy,buddy)- Maps are many and beautyful. There are maps set in Russia, Mongolia, China, Normandie,the Pacific, Germany,Africa and many other places. Each map is a little interactive masterpiece. I am not even talking about the community maps.- Tired of your soldiers being autistic? You can take direct control of anything from heavy tank destroyers to basic soldiers or even supply trucks( I like to drive them when bored).- The game is easily moddable, there are many wonderful mods.- Do you like a challenge? There are many achievements only 0.3% players have. Try to get'em all!- The game is highly competitive and skill based. You can clutch the battle with a single soldier (done that once myself in a single player scenario). On the other side, it does not forgive mistakes. You can lose your top tank in a matter of seconds if someone manages to throw an AT grenade or dynamite in your engine.- Tired of missions, mods and multiplayer? You can make your maps, and even your missions! Editor is incredibly deep, it gives you unlimited freedom and supports the majority of mods.- The physics and destructability of the game are stunning. The shell can bounce off one enemy tank and explode another. The whole map can be turned into ruins if you have enough artillery.- You are not just 'playing' as a commander. YOU ARE a commander in this game.CONS:- Missions feel copypasted for every nation... Yes, the map changes, but main objectives are constant.This is irritating.- The price is quite high. Yes, this game is a masterpiece, but still,quite expensive. Get it during sales.- DLC's are ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but at least you get to add bots into your local game with 'Airborne'.- Some units (even the 'special' ones) prove to be useless. But most games have weapons/units/items decent players never use.All in all, this game is almost perfect. This game is not going to bore you,you can play it for hundreds of hours, especially if you do it with your buddies. I am quite upset that this game is not an e-sport discipline yet.			"

												The game is an unimaginative rehash of first MoW:AS, has no campaign to speak of (there is a single-player mode, but it has no story, instead focusing on tug-of-war style gameplay that gets old after 10 minutes) and in every way the same or inferior to previous Men of War titles. There is no new content at all, and no new functionality, barring Steam Workshop support.Constant crashes and unacceptable performance for an engine that was used half a dozen times already (I have nothing against GEM, but there is no excuse for time-tested engine like GEM to drop to 3 FPS in multiplayer), with braindead tech support team that seems to get their answers from Steam community forums doesn't help either.Hell, the fact that the devs shut down MoW:AS servers so anyone at all would buy AS2 should speak for itself. MoW:AS2 is akin to a mod, there is no way in hell this can be called a new game.TL;DR♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, incompetent devs, buy MoW/FoW instead.			"

Early Access Review
								Wheres the game I purchased???I pre-ordered this title and got into the ""closed-beta"".  The game was rough, no campaign, just a few single player ""skirmish"" type missions.  I played the game a bit (atleast a few hours, my time played doesnt reflect the scenario skirmish i played for some reason), and I saw no REAL difference from their earlier games in the series, MoW;AS/etc (oh, besides the missing CAMPAIGN!!!!) and put it down to wait for the full release on the 19th. Today, release date rolls around and ............EARLY ACCESS status ???? What ?!!!!!!!!!This is an outright swindle, I pre-purchased with the impression that the title was to be FULLY RELEASED on the release date, and not into an EARLY ACCESS title.... Why 'pre-purchase' an early access title? There was no warning of this, it was not displayed on the store page, and the cost of the title warranted a COMPLETE/FULL (near AAA) release on release date, not a messed up early access, unfinished pile of trash.  The negative reviews are not represented underneath the title properly when they have many helpful 'clicks' from users.Oh yeah, not to mention the title isnt even ready on the 19th, wow. Early Access on the 20th?This purchase is seriously making me re-think ever buying another game on steam, the early access overkill is bad enough, now they have to do NINJA EARLY ACCESSS for $30!!!!. I am definitely never buying nothing from this developer again and probably never buying another non-AAA (and vouched for, released, and reviewed by proper journos) title off steam again.I'm going back to pirating peices of trash like this, good job steam/devs/early access theivery.

												This is one of the games i wish steam had a maybe button for. For starters my type of strat game is a Total War game.This game is decent in its self, but the campagin is the exact same has the first game. That being said you're mainly going to be playing mutliplayer, but thats my main problem. The multiplayer in this game has huge balancing issues, and the fact that there is a gigantic lag issue when playing with people. The lag causes your game to drop to around 15 fps and all your troops animations look super choppy as a result. Not to mention this makes direct controll a pain. Also, there are large amounts of exploits in this game making balance even worse. I.e. enemy tank is out of your range so you direct controll your tank and shoot a tree that is infront of your tank and the enemy.  ( dont believe there is a drop off for shell pen btw.) Single player was pretty fun, but I hate this games multiplayer, its espescially hard for new people because no one will put up with or teach them. Normaly your team either leaves you because of it, or starts greifing, etc.The pros:good armor pen machanicsMovements orders are ok, pretty glitchy a lot of times though.Good modding community(thats going to mean a lot, the base game is super bland)Editor is pretty fun(400 flame throwers vs 20 mg42 machine gunners? Why not!)Again the tanks are really fun to mess with peopleDirect controll is amazingly stupid and funny.(Smg preferably ppsh +at nades= Super Salty enemy)Fairly competetive mp scene(I dont really like that but some do so im listing it)MODS(Yea I know i listed it before)Game is pretty fun to play mp or coop with friends(The only friend I played this game with is a ♥♥♥ who hordes all the points to buy troops with btw then complains he has nothing while I cap points with a single guy kek)For me this game isnt really worth anywhere near $30, and the fact that this company puts stupid DLC out that doesnt even work. I'd price the game at around $15 being generous. In other words this is just a more broken MOWAS and mp works.			"

												Thinking about purchasing Men of War Assault Squad 2? Let me tell you my thoughts on this historical relic.Pros --* First, this is a Strategy-Based game!* Second, really fun with friends!* Third, has a co-op mode!* Fourth, Workshop Support!Cons --* First, Multiplayer community can be cancerous.* Second, this can be difficult to run on low-end systems.* Third, no actual story, just a campaign to show you the ropes.* Fourth, watch your flank out there! The enemy can sneak around you!Overall --Would I recommend this game? Yes, but I'd recommend playing with a friend. If you don't like it, you can always refund. Just remember,  less than 2 hours, refund within 14 days.  "

												How do you call something robbing itself apart while the nejadná only the copying of intellectual ideas or gaming machine. This is a copy of the game almost 1: 1, which is not trying to sell as a completely new title! It is therefore self-plagiarism. And although we have a similar feats in the world of games and unfortunately almost wont Shooting from different titles in the RTS, it is really new. Welcome to zero innovation, welcome to Men of War: Assault Squad 2!Let's therefore good order. The Men of War Assault Squad 2 is not a campaign in the true sense, but here is instead a system similar skirmish battles as in other RTS games. Thus, one can select from five different parties to the conflict WW2. Namely, these are Germany, the United States, the British Empire, the Soviet Union and finally the Japanese empire. It all sounds very good, the choice is really varied, at least ostensibly, but now back to reality.Men of War Assault Squad MenuMission unfortunately are not only similar, but directly consistent with those for the other fraction. Thus, for example, in the first mission for the US must take part of the map, then show prestrihová animation, which will be destroyed by Allied tank and the game will offer you this tank repair and steal it. Lala him in the first mission for the Germans, which, however, takes place during the battle for North Africa there is the same situation and that is, the player conquers the part of the map, then appears prestrihová animation where the tank of your ally destroyed and you will be offered a repair appropriation of this machine. Really great, so that was not enough, some of these maps are taken already from the previous games Men of War Assault Squad, where the first mission in the US was on the same map as the second mission in the Assault Squad 2, namely in Normandy during the D day . I do not now just the same situation, so check out, but the same map with the same layout of buildings, soldiers, and just to all, that copy 1: 1, even with the same voice in speech, the Commander, which gives you the same commands, as in the previous parts!Men of War Assault SquadSo innovative we point zero and even more below. Let's summarize but also other parts of the game. In principle, the game works on the same basis as its predecessor. Thus, the player starts on the map, which is littered with enemy units and always after the conquest of a certain part of the map was made available to the new unit, which the player can call for support. At the beginning of the map is therefore possible to call you only infantry teams, support teams, such as mortars and machine guns, then it is possible to summon support for light vehicles and, ultimately, tanks, or even aviation and artillery salvos. Depending on the selected difficulty is then derives the procedure on these maps, which will make the enemy attacks to have captured points, or the player that was tormented lightning counterattack, respectively. well coordinated offensive. This whole artificial intelligence and the behavior of units is not completely copied already from the first game.Graphically the game looks almost identical to the previous work and there is no appreciable forward. The only corrections waited icons infantry teams, where orange, or yellow tape over their character sygnalizuje ability to deal with vehicles, so they carry a kind of form of anti-tank weapons, such as. German Panzerschreck or British anti-tank rifle Boys. Yes, this is the only real change from the previous episode! Mowas2 iconAudio is well and where each faction has dubbed voices and various commands directly under the jurisdiction of their nation. This means that the Germans will speak German, Japanese will again use the Japanese language, and the like. This element, however, there is again no longer from the previous part. Nadôvažok, all voices used in this game are recycled as different from the previous work and even music in the opening menu is identical, respectively. copied from Men of War Assault Squad!Men of War Assault Squad 2 is a disappointment and a colossal dimensions. Studio, which stands for the development of this game is no great AAA studio subsidized milionovej huge investments of its multi-million publisher, but this is really unforgivable. Selling the same game, with almost zero innovation, copying all files from previous work and selling de facto the same game, just updated to the new build is such a thing unheard of and be ticked off even before it was seizing other studies and other publishers . If you're a fan of strategies and the Second World War, so I prefer to buy the first episode, because Men of War Assault Squad is definitely worth it. If you have not already played or own previous works, so choose carefully if you want to invest a further circa 30 € to its exact copy.			"

												I have always wanted a game that brings a somewhat real experience when fighting a battle in a major war. A battle isn't easy, you can't just relax and let everything else automatically win for you(unless you're incompetent), especially when you are the commander of the battle. Battles can take more than 1 hour to win and there is non-stop action throughout it. You can get very tired and stressed without pausing. Victories are incredibly rewarding even at normal difficulty. Didn't think WW2 was this fun! ))))Для флага! Вперед, солдаты!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

												Being an avid Company of Heroes fan, I figured I'd try this game out as it seems to have many facets of realism most other RTS games do not. Well I was right, it does have that realism. Unfortunatley, it's so realistic that it takes away from the ""fun"" aspect of the game in a sense. Don't get me wrong its a solid game, and I wish I paid $10 or $15, not $35, leaving me kind of wishing I could get that money back. Also I've noticed the game has some stability issues, and an excessive amount of lag on a computer that surpasses the recommended requirements for the game. All in all I would wait for this game to be reduced to atleast $15 before buying it. My score would be a 6.5/10.			"

												Ahh Men of War: Assault Squad 2, very good game.If you like RTS games and WW2 games this is one game for you, MOW:AS 2 is quite an enjoyable game but yet at times it can be a time consuming RTS game also a quick heads up here-->, (please note that this game is a bit CPU intensive). If you are new to the game some missions on the campaign will probably take you hours or even alot of minutes, but do not worry too much, with a reasonable amount of hours of playing the game you will eventually get uset to the game and you will probably be able to get through all the mission easily on the easy difficulty, also I do not recommend going straight into a battle that isn't matchmaking on multiplayer, otherwise it will be frustrating considering all the skilled players out there that play unranked games alot, but anyways this game has a wide variety of units if you looked in the trailer and 5 different countries to play as, (U.S.A,Germany,USSR,Britain and imperialist Japan).With that said I do highly reccomend MOW:AS 2 to anyone out there that loves RTS games.Now go and have fun and destroy whatever country you are going to v.s.

												TL;DR  Lots of fun. Skill required. Totally multiplayer oriented. Recommended.This is definitely the best RTS I have ever played. The game itself is really well balanced. Multiplayer provides you with countless possiblities of destroying other players what appears to be way more entertaining than fighting AI. MoW:AS2 is meant to be played on multiplayer, that's why the skirmishes are so poor in content. What I find to be really interesting about MoWAS: - Stealth, you can generaly hide one of your soldiers in the bushes, waiting for the enemy tanks to approach and immediately destroy at least one of them using AT grenades. The enemy won't be able to spot you without using his own infantry. That's what makes the game feel like a real combat experience. Tanks will always be in need of support, otherwise the enemy will be able to ambush them with ease. - Micromanagement, every unit has a certain amount of ammunition. They can quickly run out of it so you need to make sure that they have got a steady source of ammo. In multiplayer you can simply call a resupply truck which will fully automatically replenish ammunition of your soldiers. Simple, but makes the game way more difficult. - Direct control, you can take control of every single unit that is available in the game. If you feel like you want to do something yourself - do it. It's simple as that. - Destructible environment, not much to say. You can turn every single building into ruin.  - Unit accuracy and damage, I love the way developers programmed that part of the game. Units deal high damage depending on their distance between them and their enemy, so it's really easy to build a line of defence which can't be simply rushed.  - Great vehicle armour mechanics, every vehicle has it's armour. Some are thick, some are not. In MoWAS you need to learn which tanks are going to be destroyed by 76mm gun and which ones require some more firepower. It took my hours to understand what are my tanks capable of.Things that I find annoying or poorly made: - Singleplayer, it basically does not exist. There are skirmishes, but it's nothing interesting in them. - Pathfinding, if you order your troops to run to a certain position then sometimes they might take the longest possible route. - Projectile penetration, sometimes a panzerfaust projectile might get stuck in bale of wheat, you know - standard stuff.

Early Access Review
								I have been playing the closed beta since release date and after 3 patches its looking much better...Overall its a big improvement over Assault Squad 1 with the main differences being visual quality and the interface.The use of much newer shaders and multi cpu core support has improvewd the game to a huge degree.. IMHO anyways...The AI seems much smarter and this may be a benefit of multi core support as everyting isnt being computed by just one cpu core ( This is the first game in the series to utilises more than 1 CPU core )Due to the better performance everything seems much quicker and smoother and more realistic....New vehicle models look much cleaner and more detailed with the new 3D models and shaders...I have noticed the following improvements that some might see as trivial but overall they make for a better game... IMHO- Vehicle crews board and unboard vehicles more quickly....- Grenade throws are quicker ( in manual control mode anyway )- Vehicle crews will look for a nearby repair kit if they are told to repair a vehicle and repair kit is not in vehicle...- Ammo out icon for soldiers is great.....- Vehicle damage icon is great...- Vehcile reloading icon on sqaud icon is great..-  New squad icons that show individual soldiers health status is also great.- Inventory exchange bug crash from all previous games is  fixed...- Transferring ammo between vehicles is less likely to result in the two vehicles crashing into each other.- Mortar crews move a bit faster when told to move with the mortar.- Mortar AI seems better, You can now use a sniper or officer with binoculars to spot targets and the mortar will engage more wi;;ingly.- Repairs are quicker.- Grouped soldiers / squads move more smoothly and try to keep the original placement in the squad ( rough formation ) when told to move.- Dying / death animaytions seem more varied and more realistic..- Soldiers loose their helmets less than previous games... ( no more constanty picking up helmets micro managment )- Transferring ammo to a whole squad from a dead soldier or ammo crate is more intelligent,  it gives the correct ammo to the correct soldier ( in most cases ) based on the weapon they are carrying. ( and doesn't crash the game like MOW and AS1 did.. )- Mine laying seems quicker..- Steam workshop support is a great feature because it will make sharing content easy for everyone..All of my observations are from playing single player missions only and don't reflect the Multi player / Cooperative modes of the game....

								Ugly ugly UI, Graphics are way over sold, as the game isn't optimized to run with high graphics settings. No tutorial, except for skirmish mode, but that's not even really a tutorial. Feel it is very unpolished, Animations are kind of ugly with troops and very buggy/ glitchy. Once it is polished up I would be able to recommend it but as of right now I'd wait for a few patches.

												The singleplayer is interesting, but every nation has the same missions just with different maps. The objectives are the all the same. So that bored me a lot.Multiplayer is super ♥♥♥♥ed up! Matchmaking is not really good matching, because you will face player with level 20 while you are level 1 - therefore you cant get the good units. In addition, they mostly are so much better than you, you get rushed within 3 minutes and then the game is pretty lost. Another point is, that the multiplayergame is very buggy and you suffer a lot from disconnects, the developers still cant fix it and you wont be able to reconnect ....Super fail!			"

												The concept is great. However, the way this game was done is really bad. I played MoWAS a lot. The new game is really disappointing. Lack of new units is ntop the problem. The biggest issue is performance. The game lags a whoel lot. AS one looked at least as good as this one on the same specs, and it ran without issues. Thsi oen lags a lot. Matchmaking: nice new addition. Would be at least, if it was stable. Getting into a match is a major pain in the ♥♥♥. Leveling system: why??? Play trough the boring campaing missions, just to be able to play with units like a sniper? The missions are the same as in MowAS, and even back then, the ctrl C cntrl V missions were really boring after the 3rd one. I am really disappointed. Don't buy this, buy MoWAS instead.			"

												I bought this game after having been a long time fan of Men of War. I loved the amazing physics and incredible depth, and it's one of my favourite games of all time.Assault Squad 2 on the other hand is a stinky piece of crap. They somehow managed to regress in the area of gameplay from the first game and the entire thing just feels soulless and rushed. The physics are completely unrealistic and boring to play with, which was the main appeal of the original game to me. I loved burning down entire buildings with molotovs to advance on a fortified position, yet in Assault Squad 2 things as little as sandbags are invincible bulwarks against even tank rounds.i bought this in sale and feel ripped off			"

												Men of War: Assault Squad with a worse interface and NO ♥♥♥♥ING IMPROVEMENTS.Make no mistake. You're paying for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ UI change and worse performance just to get MP servers that work.Enjoyed frontlines mode? Then ♥♥♥♥ YOU, still no new maps or gamemode updates. In fact they actually REMOVED maps!And to add insult to injury they added a ♥♥♥♥ing worthless level system. Thankfully the host can disable the XP system but if he doesn't you get to 'enjoy' losing because you can't field anything to counter ♥♥♥♥ like the Tiger until you level up. I'm not a fan of the special units like the Radio OP either though I can live with them.It's like MoW with all the worst bits of CoH:2 added. Buy it only if, like me, you're desperate for more MoW MP and too weak to go without. If you wish to play SP buy MoW1 instead since it has actual ♥♥♥♥ing campaigns.Also the DLC is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, don't buy it. You've been warned.			"

												I hate to say this about one of my favorite RTS series, but, do not buy this game, its fine and all, except that they basically repackaged Assault Squad 1 with a new hud and a few new missions. This new ""update"" of theirs totally trashed my game, I cant even play a game I payed money for. But if this is your first time seeing a game from the massive franchise that this came from, take my advice, buy one of the older games, these games are great fun, but in their current state of money whoring, they arent fun anymore. What is a game that is lacking in the core function of being fun? It's not a game, it's a waste of money.Edit: October 29, 2016Huh, it seems I have fixed it. but, it still does not change my review because that wasn't the reason for it to begin with, but for anyone with this problem, use this;api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll is missingMSVCR110.dll is missingMake sure you have your windows fully updated.Locate and run vcredist x86 in your commonredist folder located inside of your game install location.C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common			"

												First of all i just want to say that if you have never played any men of war game then i highly recommend assault squad 21. Its a good looking game2. it has nice features that you don't find in other strategy games E.G you can directly control individual units, each unit has an inventory...3. its basically like company of heroes with a worse story line but better featuresNow as to why i dont recommend this game, if you have assault squad 1 then seriously just save your money, the developers have literally slightly improved the graphics added a couple of extra levels and then slapped a number 2 in the title and said its a second game, you will come across a lot of levels from the first assault squad that are literally carbon copies, same crappy voice acting and all. the only reason i have put any hours into this game is so that i feel as if im getting my moneys worth.So yeah all in all a good game but if you have assault squad 1 just dont bother.

												If you've played Men of War: Assault Squad 1, you won't find any surprises here. Some new art assets, but no new gameplay or differing modes.Most of the maps are directly lifted from AS1.So is the interface....i think the maps are even listed in the same order.As with the first, you can individually complete the skirmish maps, but there is no campaign to speak of, and no attempt is made to link the map you just finished with the following one.I really enjoyed the original Assault Squad and happily clicked my way through its map list, it was new and fresh...by the end of the list, however, I was happy it was over. The missions are formulaic and tedious.I'm 4 maps into Assault Squad 2 and I'm already tired of the forumula.(holding out for reinforcements while being able to order as many tanks and troops as I like doesn't even make sense)I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this just seems a stale reinterpretation of Assault Squad 1.Wait for a $5 sale.

												Just my two cents. Not a full review. If you have Men of War Assault Squad 1, don't buy it unless it's on sale for really cheap! Since it's only  around $5 during todays daily sale, give it a shot if you have the cash to spare and enjoy mow in engeral. Anyhow, MOWAS2 doesn't seem to have too many innovative improvements from it's predecessor. However, the integration of steam workshop and the move to direct x10 is a nice improvement. With that said, it's not perfect and seems to only improve on the last title in subtle ways. Definitely worth a play for the right price.			"

												If you've played Men of War: Assault Squad 1, you won't find any surprises here. Some new art assets, but no new gameplay or differing modes.Most of the maps are directly lifted from AS1.So is the interface....i think the maps are even listed in the same order.As with the first, you can individually complete the skirmish maps, but there is no campaign to speak of, and no attempt is made to link the map you just finished with the following one.I really enjoyed the original Assault Squad and happily clicked my way through its map list, it was new and fresh...by the end of the list, however, I was happy it was over. The missions are formulaic and tedious.I'm 4 maps into Assault Squad 2 and I'm already tired of the forumula.(holding out for reinforcements while being able to order as many tanks and troops as I like doesn't even make sense)I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this just seems a stale reinterpretation of Assault Squad 1.Wait for a $5 sale.

												I see all these comments its just men of war 1 repackaged and to that i say. THATS EXACTLY WHY MOST OF US BOUGHT IT you see these trailers you could see what you were getting into if you had half a brain and eyeballs during the trailers while yes new content new game would be nice. If your getting into the franchise then buy this not MOW 1 its dated while it does have little bugs (my experince) and really good gameplay this looks much more appealing to the eye and honestly bugs that happen are usally visual (again my experince) and this also has really good gameplay. and honestly anyone who hasnt bought this after playing MOW 1 for ages should buy this anyway give your eyes something to look at instead of horribly dated graphics.

												Men of War:Assault Squad 2 is the most INDEPTH rts I've seen in my entire life.    For someone looking to experience an authentic World War II RTS, this game is for you. The developers at Digitalmindsoft have been blessed by the PC gods and have managed to bestow us this masterpiece. Why do I like this game so much? I think one of the major selling points was the GARGANTOUS range of options. I am specifically referring to the mouth watering stash of firearms, light tanks, medium tanks, HEAVY tanks, fighter planes, destroyers(big boats) and the diverse types of ammunition that accompany them. Not convinced yet? Then take a look at the cover system in place, allowing the player to cleverly place infantry so that they can take advantage of their surroundings. But forget all that. Who even cares if you can control every freaking infantry, vehicle, and weapon known in this game? Who cares if you can dump 20 hours of playing time just in the editor mode making crazy scenarios and reenacting battles? If you're not convinced by now, then my words haven't done the game justice. Check it out for yourself if you won't take my word. Chances are, you'll be as impresssed as I was and still am.LAST BUT NOT LEASTIf you're going to play multiplayer, bring some lube.			"

Please, Do not buy this game, get the origenal insted : Costs less, Has the best effort put into its creation, and lest face it, its LITTERALY the exact same game, look at the trailers of both and you'll see, i think i've said it enough in this review. good luck Soldier			"

												Monetized content by DMS, removal of dissenting comments, not a company worth supporting.  As for the game itself, it's a men of war game which come from a long line of men of war - faces of war - soldiers games which thankfully wasn't managed by DMS.  The skirmish battles are uninspired and reptitive with essentially 3 map templates repeated over across multiple maps.  You have your generic attack missions, your generic defense missions, and lastly your generic 'stealth' assault missions.  They all have the same templates which makes playing a seperate map feel like deja vu all over again.  Generic patrol gets ambushed, go repair and steal the tank before the first enemy wave arrives, etc..  Group of tank in the middle is always present in the ""stealth"" missions which doesn't require stealth at all nor proper extraction of any but one unit.  As there's no real story mode or any sense of progression, you're just left switching from one template to the same exact template with just a scenary change.The only real saving grace is there are mods as there's always been, and modders can actually make decent maps.

												Here is my honest review.I have been playing MOW a long time, and have enjoyed it quiet well. AS2 on the other hand I didn't like. It's trash. Plain and simple. Campaign is litterally the same as MOWAS with the DLC missions included. You have to pay money to get new campaigns and features that they should've implemeted when the game came out. Multiplayer is the same way. No new maps, and you have to pay to get new ones. Out synce errors that they have said they have fixed MULTIPLE times, but never have. The gameplay is garbage compared to MOWAS. Then theres the workshop. It was going really good, until they made some patch, that required mods to update when every minor patch came out, that didn't even affect the mod. The only reason I have so many hours in this game, is due to mods. The mods, made this game good, plain and simple. Honestly, all this game is a money horder.So would I recommend this game?Nope.

												I know that a lot of people are saying that this game is a copy of the first assault squad. The 2 have some similarities, but there are also some differences.The units and tanks do look the same. They have added a few units but not very many. I know that this game is a sequel, which means that the game should be similar, but this game looks REALLY SIMILAR. Pros:-The game has pretty good gameplay and quite a few levels.-The game is very addictive.-There are many different types of units and countries to play as.-There are probably 50 different tanks, and each one feels very different from the others.Cons: -This game is bascially a reskin of the first one. Some of the maps are nearly identical, and many of the units are the same.-This game has some of the worst voice acting that I have ever heard. Since when did German field commanders have American accents?-This game is too expensive when compared to teh first which is much cheaper and very similar.Summary:Although the game is good, it is basically a copy and paste of the first and seems to be a cash grab. I just picked the first one up and a whole bunch of DLC on sale for $5. Just buy the 1st one and save yourself a lot of money. I give this game a 5/10.			"

Let your flame throwers burn the whole forest down and everyone inside it.Great sounds.Great visuals. destructable environment.Great inventory system for all troops.Adjustable game speedIn a day when most RTS's are ♥♥♥♥, this really shines.

												I've played MOWAS2 Both ways, with friends, versus, and singleplayer. Therefor, I can tell you the best of both-sides.Singleplayer gameplay: The missions in the second MOWAS are an intresting idea, rather then the classic ""Move up and capture"" system, you are given challenges/difficult side-objectives. Such as, defend the three trench points untill reinforcements, or stealth tasks, or even running out of reinforcements! It's a cool idea, but, it gets old. There are times when you just want to play a classic ""Assault and Secure"" objective mission, and don't feel like the new stuff. Multiplayer Gameplay: I feel the game is centered on multiplayer. It is a blast to mow down your enemies together, and move up in the bloody battlefields together. But, there are SO MANY PROBLEMS WITH MULTIPLAYER. Example, if a player tabs out of the game, everyones framed will drop about 40-50 frames, it's not just me, it's everyone I've played with. And, if you're un-lucky, they won't restore to your normal frame-rate. Plus, if you have a bad ping, it will also reduce frames for everyone else. It's really annoying, and they really need to fix it.Preformance: Men of War: Assualt Squad 2 is so horribly optimized. No-matter what GPU You have, or how many gigs of RAM you have, no matter what you do, you cannot escape the horrible FPS Drops. Singleplayer AND Multiplayer. The explosions of ANYTHING, molotovs, vehicles, or even buildings can freeze/crash your game, or make your frames drop severly. I know it's only a beta, and that's why I'm trying to keep my paitence. But, it sometimes get's unplayable. Something they need to fix PRONTO.Overall outcome: I think MOWAS2 has awesome potential, the awesome new graphics, and relieving bug fixes from the first, really make you get excited for new updates. But, the game is not worth the price it has. For a un-optimized, partially buggy, FPS Dropping beta, $30, $20, or even $15 is WAY Too much. I'd say maybe $10 for the BETA. And I will do a review on the offical release of the full game.Minor/annoying bugs: The bugs in MOWAS2 Are small, but really annoying. Example, your tanks won't always shoot at the targets that are most vital, example, I was playing as the Soviet Union, and a Panther was grinding my Infantry, and my T-34, rather focus on the Panther, focused on infantry. Luckily, you can press ""E"", and take manual control of your units, (Also needs work), you can take out yourself, annoying, but playable. That's really it for the bugs.Final Verdict: I'll give MOWAS2 a 6/10, Great potential, but needs tons of work.Since that was Early Access, it's time for the whole game.MOWAS2 In my opinion is a train-wreck of, BS Tank penetration, re*tarded path finding, awful voice acting, and most of all, LAG LAG LAG AND MORE LAG.Gameplay: MOWAS2's Gameplay is alright. Rather then the traditional ""Unit"" engine, the game runs off of indiviual men in a squad. For example, unlike in other strategy games, you can split off other single men to preform tasks, like, if there is a Tiger coming down the road, you can sneak a guy in the building to the side, and AT 'Nade it, or, if there is a squad, killing yours, sneak an SMG over and wreck the entire squad from one guy behind. This may sound awesome, but it has ALOT of flaws. Example, the faction balance is horrible. Germany and U.K are just stupidly overpowered. While the United Kingdom had ♥♥♥♥ takes in WW2, they beat ♥♥♥♥ing EVERYTHING. It's un-realistic. And downright annoying. They have huge armor, and for some reason, the guns devistate anybody. Tiger, to an M20. They will get 1-hitted.Gameplay: Tanks: The tanks in the game can be really fun, or really annoying. Even though you have the ablility to press ""E"" And take control of any man/unit in the game, it still feels very unfinished. The aiming, ecspeically in tanks is really really REALLY hard. The gun never fires at the right thing, but over/under it. And meh, just dosent' feel very nice. The tanks for America are SO underpowered. I know that they had horrible armor, But even the pershing seems UP. Like, a f*ucking 2Pndr AT Gun can 1-Hit a Sherman. A 2 POUNDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sorry. I get kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at this game cause it has such great potential, but just dosen't go reach it's hight of glory. German tanks are okay. They could be better. But, meh. They're playable. The Soviet Union's tanks are pretty BS OP as-well. A T-34 57 can One-hit anything. A tiger, to a jeep. It's screwed. Japan's tanks are ♥♥♥♥. But, it's how it was.Gameplay: Infantry: Infantry isn't really a problem in MOWAS2, They're pretty balanced. Actually, very balanced. Vehicles seem to ruin the fun play of infantry. Having a fierce fire-fight? It'd be a shame if a tank just ran everyone over. I don't really have much to say about this. Gameplay:Multiplayer: This is what ruins MOWAS2. Though, there are single-player missions in the game, the missions are crap though, as said in my Pt. 1 in my review, but, the multiplayer in MOWAS2 can be really fun, if you don't have the FRAME DROPS AND THE LAG SPIKES ALL THE TIME! I swear, if you dare, DARE tab out, or anybody tabs out, it's a ♥♥♥♥♥torm of FPS drops, timeouts, and frustration. And, the game seems to drop FPS randomly. Not a massive problem. The game is very well optimised. And it's nice to play even on low.I really can't be bothered to make a huge Pt.2, due to the fact that I could go on for days. Final Verdict, of Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is a 4/10 Awful Strategy game.			"

												This game looks beautiful. But its an unruly beast to control. You are basically controlling a section against companies of enemy, which is OK, but you have your hands full fighting a floating camera, and imbedded menus within a realtime environment where time flows too fast for the micro management involved. Even with pausing and performing actions while paused something seems off. I could buy this game today for $8.97 on a weekend sale, but I wouldn't get much fun out of it having downloaded a 24 hour trial I have determined its not for me. Its a shame they can't  re-vamp this game because it really looks awesome and its a scale of game I typically enjoy.  I've played a few of this series before, like faces of war, men of war 1, in a similar seed but found not much has changed,  too scripted for my liking.			"

												Men of War Assault Squad 2 - in my opinion the current best (and hardest) RTS game with a  WW2 setting.The game features a lot of missions split up between the 5 different nations. Germany, GB, USA, Japan & Sovjet Russia. While the pattern for the missions is the same they do play entirely different due too the different maps & nations. Defend - attack - defend is what the first mission, more like tutorial mission, is like. Every other mission is either attack or defend. You have to capture outposts, reach waymarks and defend hills & important places. Easy, yet challenging.There is no base building involded - you gain new units via reinforcement points or by capturing enemy tanks. Yes, capturing enemy tanks. Each and every one of your units can be split up, managed individually, forged into a new squad, has his own inventory, can be used with manual aim [...]. Including tanks! Tanks can be used with minimum manpower - the driver only. Or you can fully stack up and even place infantry on the back of the tank for faster movements. Its entirely up to you.You units can switch weapons, ammo & special items, you can loot dead enemies to gain new weapons and ammo [...] the possibilitys are endless.What is the challenging part of all this? Sounds rather nice, doesnt it? The challenging part is the micromanagement, map awareness and realism. Tanks who get to close to trenches full of infantery - one AT grenade to his engine and hes busted. Infantery running over an open field - on mg salvo, all dead. The game does everything right that can be done right - a solid 10/10!			"

												This is a potentially great game.  Currently there is just too much micro-management of squads for me.  I prefer to concentrate on the strategy, not re-supplying my troops.  Too many steps to re-supply.  If the squad could re-supply by being next to the supply truck or downed soldier(s) that would be better all the current steps required to re-supply them.  Reduce the amount of clicks.			"

												Guess this game is nice if you just want to jump into a match. There is no actual campaign though, which is disappointing. The skirmishes just throw you into a conflict without any regards to knowledge. You can watch YouTube clips for the tutorial. Out of 10 I would give this game a 5. It is good to the point that the tactics are solid, the graphics are nice. The UI could use some work as it isn't clear how to quickly switch from one squad to the next without manually doing it. If there was a campaign with an actual story line that lead to a destination then I would totally buy this game. But I don't have the time to watch all the videos in order to teach myself this game just to play against far superior players. This game feels more like an early access than a complete game due to all the key RTS factors that it doesn't have.			"

It could've been something so much more, but apparently the developers couldn't think of a single thing from WW2 to add to their ""second"" installment, which is a *Cough* copy and paste from the orignal.

												The game is basically a worse rip-off of the first game. The devs have banned poeple for speaking the truth about this and dont get me started on the DLC. The game will only give you a couple hours of fun, and multiplayer is done so that you have to unlock units based on your level which is **** because if you are new to the game you will only have a couple of units to choose from and your opponents (which are all high levels) have access to everything, so you will lose pretty much all your games.overall: Devs are bad because they cant take criticism. game is ok There are plenty of other games out there whos devs care about the game AND the community that you should get.

												I've only played a few minutes and i can already respect the people who play this game, but its not my cup of tea.MoW: Assault Squad 2 is a very tecnical game, you need to position troops over a huge map and acomplish multiple objectives in a single stage to achieve victories, the character models are too small and the map is too big, its a dream come true if you have the patience to carefully observe all angles and possible positions for your army, but otherwise its a bit of a nightmare, i dont generally complain about the blessings a game bestows upon us gamers, but this game is a bit too hard to micromanage for normal people.If you love strategy games, this is just like Commando (the old squad strategy game were you had to use only 4 characters to destroy entire german bases), in that winning maps takes minute planning, except in here you get to field an entire army, in much bigger map, which expands as you clear objectives (so you cant plan ahead too much sometimes)Its a great game, its just a bit too much consuming and quite big on micromanaging. I suggest you try it if its still free on steam when you read this review.			"

												I would really like to give this game a 'thumbs up' but I am quite anooyed at how the devs have released DLC after DLC instead of the FREE UPDATES they promised. The most meaningful 'update' I have seen added the ability for units to auto re-supply. Oh, and they added a tank that is pretty terrible. Apart from that I havent noticed any change in the game since launch. Also, the AI in the game is still terrible, sometimes my AT troops will break cover and run up to a tank and get mowed down, instead of firing the launchers they have. I have over 300hrs on AS1 and to be honest this is the same game with a few new SP missions. On the MP side, I have yet to fully experience it as I have NEVER BEEN ABLE TO JOIN A MULTIPLAYER MATCH. Googling for my problem results in millions of results for 'MOW AS2 Out of sync error'. This issue has still not been fixed for 1000s of people since launch. I feel pretty bad that I convinced my friend to buy this so we could play together only to discover none of us can join any MP matches. The editor is very fun and is where I spend most of my time, but it is almost the same as AS1 in most aspects.HOWEVER, This is still a fun game (if you like spending 3 days to make a decent looking map to have fun battles on against the ai you have to script every move and action for) and this is indicated by my high playtime on both titles. I heard the devs recently added AI to MP mathces (Which should have been a free update not DLC) and from what I hear, it is pretty terrible.Would still play this over COH2 though.verdict (without editor): 4/10            (with editor)      : 6/10            (forgetting multiplayer ever existed) : 8/10			"

												I only tried the game when it was playable for free for a few days. Not much of a strategy player, yet I HAVE played some in the past, and the problem for me, with this one, was that I was totally lost right away. The mission objectives are quite clear, the UI isn't too cluttered, yet I still didn't know how to actually control my soldiers. I'd try to get some to throw grenades, marked several at once to take out an enemy shooter, etc, and it only worked like a quarter of the time. I'd try all kinds of combinations (left click, mouse click, function keys), yet never was sure whether I am supposed to manage each soldier individually, command a small group, and how exactly to get them to actually do a certain thing. I looked for a tutorial, and all I found was a bunch of short youtube videos linked in game, which didn't help much either.Call me a total idiot, if you like, and no, I didn't try the first MoW. But I think if the developer is trying to get new players to join in this day and age (call it the idiot age where people do like tutorials to learn the controls instead of watching youtube vids or googling for a guide), they might wanna give newcomers some clue on how to actually control your troops correctly, without them having to try by trial and error how to even make a soldier throw a grenade. ANY indicator would help.			"

Early Access Review
								703 Hours of playing Men of war Assult Squad 1. After playing 2, I noticed right away that theres no reload option for my units. Infact there are less options all around. You can imagine for a player who enjoys absolute control this was quite a let down. I also noticed that the company icons look alot like company of heros unit icons. I played the entire first mission through the Americans and to my suprise after capturing 2 flags i still couldn't recruit a morter team nor could I recruit an mg team and when i recruited a ranger team instead of coming in a half track like they usually do they came on foot. Im greatly frusterated because to me in feels like they have gone backwards and taken away more then improved it. As a devoted fan there are many things already about this game that really make it feel like company of heros 2. If you were to ask me if you should buy this i would definitly wait for it to be finished, im extremely unhappy about what iv'e seen as of now. "

Early Access Review
								Better Game? - NO, I cant believe some of the other reviews here ( suggesting to me they havnt played the game at all yet) for those who have played the closed BETA. Its laggy, visually harder to play on the maps, and many crashes (it was near on impossible to play a full game, never mind trying to find someone who was still playing it - due to crashes, this was reported by many closed beta users) - this is a complete disaster and many of the MOWAS users have abandoned it already (and gone back to playing the original game) - a bit like the COH scenario ( 1st one better than the latter). It really is a dissapointing effort by the DEVS, I have played MOWAS for years, along with our little clan of about 20 of us, and were all of the same opinion - ( I think this is the same engine going to be used in Call to Arms, same Dev, and assume its being used as a test bed for this game. I have already cancelled my purchase on steam for this game. It promises much, but delivers little. What we needed was a expansion of MOWAS (such as new maps, different units, different nation addedd, and the bugs that stiil exist in the original to be ironed out (devs still cant do that, so there wasnt much hope with this new version).

								1 out of 5!It is just awful!! I'm big fan of men of war, but this....First of all I've not seen anything new, except some new units, and you call it Part Two? It's more like extension pack!Campaign - is so short so you can pass it in one evening.And most irritated things are bugs!Crashes arise every hour, when you exit the game it's always a crashIt's impossible to play in multiplayer, connection lost or crashes is what you'll getIf host is out, the game is finished, OMG in 2014 you can't make a game with decentralized host??You think that if you buy an engine and make few missions you can sell it ? No guys, this is scam!!Update!It's year 2015, and you know what? This piece of s..t still crashes!! in multiplayer players are constantly dropping!I don't even understand what comes with those patches, new fonts for UI?			"

												I loved this game, the gameplay and the depth of units and nations was awesome, but this game has performancy issues and crashes and OOS still hasn't been killed off the enitre series.I didn't mind the Crashes the perf problems or the oos, I still loved the game.But now recently, the units themselves got broken. This is where I put my line.All flamethrowers are broken, Isuzu AA is broken. and other units as well.And the developers dont seem to care. When the game has performance problems, I don't really mind them. But when the units, the core of the game are broken? this is where I draw my line folks.When they will fix this game, which they will never will. Then it would be a good game.But right now its to broken for gameplay, do not buy. CHEERS			"

												Game is broken, has been broken and likely will always be broke. Cash grabs like this often have little effort put into them. This is nothing more than AS1 with broken promises, a community Czar, and a defunct online system. Save your money!I gave this game every chance, I have been banned on the forums numerous times for expressing my concern in a civil manner; they simply don't care and don't want the bad press. I am thankful this game was gifted to me, but I am sorry someone wasted their money on it. Don't be fooled by these cons and tricksters. The Store page is a misleading representation of the game, planes are only in the single player and skirmish missions ( which are horrible) Mulitplayer has the SAME EXACT units as AS. Game is crap, company is crap.			"

												This is a great game, after you get passed all of the issues.  The game is still plauged with out of syncs that have been there for over 5 months now.  The performance you get in multiplayer is dictated almost entirely by other people's PCs.  My friend with a gtx 970 is laging on this game but it works fine on singleplayer because there arent other players.  I am also getting a gtx 970 so I will update this and see how it works for me. The Editor:  Holy ♥♥♥♥ is this awesome,  you can make your own maps and missions with it, im currently making some myself and it feels just great.  The Graphics:  The game's units are out rageously outdated.  some of the tank models actually havent been updated sense men of war 1 (almsot 6 years ago).  The infantry skins are rather poor, all you need to do is look for some on the steam workshop and they look signifigantly better than the ones in this game.At the current time I cant say I recommend this game, I wish that a bigger team was working on it and had the budget to make this game what it deserves to be.

Early Access Review
								I played th Beta, and the second skirmish misson for the U.S. is completely broken. Towards the end, you have to get to an extraction point. Simple enough, except it's guarded by an anti-aircraft gun that can see you for miles, and you can't get close enough to take it out. There are three tanks in the level, but the game won't let you take them. You also, have a fixed amount of points, and when I got to the end of the level, I was only able to call in Officers (They literally can't do anything), a single medic (slightly less useless at the point I was at), and snipers (Very useful normally). Funnily enough, it's impossible to shoot off the gunner from the front, and there's no spot I could get to that was behind it, or to the side of it. On top of that, tanks continued to spawn, making the situation worse. If I'm buying a game from you, I should actually be able to play it, instead of just losing, almost automaticly. I'm serverly dissapointed, especially since when I bought it, there were numerous games on sale, invluding the ENTIRE rockstar collection. I could've bought half of them for the same price of this game, but I liked the first Assualt Squad, and was so excited for this one, I wanted to get a little cheaper, and make sure I got it. To summarize, broken level, automatic failure, frustration, anger.			"

												The Men of War series is one of my favorite PC games ever. This installment is just a polished MoW Assault Squad I, rereleased with a few extra bells and whistles. On sale, it's worth $10-$20, and if you're a fan of the series than it's worth a little more. It's RTS, squad-control, and micro-management to the extreme. I love being able to control a whole squad, or tank, all the way down to a single infantry man who can pick up a dropped grenade, ammo clip, or check a fallen soldiers inventory. I recommend it for fans of Dawn of War II, CoH's, and the Total War series.  "

												This game is perfect for all you war nuts and RTS fans out there. If you looked at this game and thought it would be fun, get it, it is. This game strikes a fantastic balance of macro and micro managing, from telling a group of soldiers to take cover to manually controlling a tank. The detailed visuals and sounds just add so much to an already amazing game. If you have ever played ""Close Combat"" or similar games you will love this game. The feeling you get when you drop a 600mm (23.6 inches to fellow americans) diameter Rocket on several tanks blowing them several meters into the air and then watching the wreckage rain down from the sky is amazing.

												First off, let me begin by stating that I purchased the complete edition of this game when it was on sale for $10. If you already have the original Men of War: Assault Squad, I don't reccomend buying this game for full price. Wait until it goes on sale and grab the complete edition. Alright, now that I've gotten that out of the way, let me begin my review. :)This game is awesome, and for RTS lovers, a must buy. The detail is great and the options for battlefield tactics are unlimited. I haven't played a RTS that handles combat as well this does. If you're a Star Wars fan, get the Galaxy at War mod. It'll completely blow away the land battles in Empire at War. Lastly, this game runs very well on my laptop. I have a Nvidia GeForce GT 640M (1GB Dedicated GDDR5) and I'm getting 60+ fps with little action and 30+ when the fighting is heavy on medium settings. Overall I reccomend this game to all RTS lovers.			"

												This game like all the other Men of War games is a complete master piece!This game isnt to much of a change from Men of War: Assault Squad 1, but there are some small things that make it that much better. 1: Graphics are a bit better and some bug fixes (some)2: Better units. Example: In the mission Overlord for the americans, when calling in paratroopers a squad of 5 parachutes in, instead of just one trooper, this is a major fix in my mind, logically you would send 1 trooper in at a time and sending in squads would be a more ""rational"" amount. 3: MAJOR FIX: mulitplayer is fixed and you can play online, unlike the other Men of War: Assault Squad that ran off of game spy (an unused and discontinued gaming network). This makes the game so much better, multiplayer, for players who has friends that don't own the game, or those who don't have friends (if you don't have any, make some!)4: This isn't a fix but makes the game so much more fun, Steam Workshop, custom maps easier to get and mods the same! There are some great maps and mods on the workshop and i recommend anyone that has to check it out!This game get a 10/10 for the beautiful and never ending fun that the game gives!			"

												Background: Having just come off of 150 hours on Company of Heroes 2 this game kicked my butt. Like seriously there are not many games that I review that I highly recommend to Follow the Tutorials to the T.  I also never played the First one or the HD Remake of the First One.The Take on Realism: You have to worry about ammo, medkits, and form infantry columns that are able to tackle a variety of situation from assaulting in CQC or disabling Armor. Repairing damaged vehicles actually takes Real Time Minutes to complete. Individual units within your formations can be targeted and taken out. Nothing is safe out there. On easy difficulty I found myself overwhelmed sometimes with Management that a single MG can pin you down and seal the deal.  To add to this each unit has its own manageable inventory. Like a single rifleman will have 250 .30-06 rounds on him, his M1 Garand, Helmet, Shovel, and maybe a grenade. Your Russian officer will have a pistol, 70 rounds, officer hat. Don’t worry equipment can be transferred between units.This realism also extends to Line of Sight Mechanics. Most RTS we are used to our units having to rely on sight lines combo’d with a set Range they can fire. Well with this game, your tank can literally shoot in whatever direction if your mouse lets you. So go nuts, shoot across 3 wheat fields into the dirt if you’d like. (See Armor Mechanics below for your True Ranges)Note: they do give us one freebie with Ammo management and that is a single 8 man unit that you form by mouse dragging Automatically Shares Ammo.  This is great because you can click on one man run him to the ammo truck, load him up with 5000 rounds, run back to the defensive line, rejoin him to a unit and bam, the entire unit is rearmed. The Campaign: There are a nice array of factions to play. Though the campaign is a Copy Paste for each faction, it gives you a great way to learn each Faction’s strengths and weaknesses to ultimately prepare you for Online Matchmaking.  The Campaign Scenarios are actually built well to teach you LOS, Direct Unit Control, Defense of an objective, Flanking, Sniping, Armor Control and Field Guns. Direct Control: There are a few other games I have seen in recent years that allow Direct control over units within an RTS.  There are a couple on Steam but I fail to remember their names.  Direct control happens in a 3rd person Top Down view. Note that this is a Single Unit. A Single Man, a Single Tank, etc. In this mode you control all aspects of the Unit, aiming with mouse and movement that you can modify to be the Arrow keys or WASD. I highly suggest getting used to this mode as it is invaluable at all difficulty levels. Direct control of a tank is superior in all ways and will help you survive online and in the Scenarios.Armor Mechanics: I’m going to distill this down to as simple as I can. Scoring a hit on any Vehicle is factored in by a number of ways. Your unit has armor penetration values applied at 3 different ranges. This is to say how much armor it can penetrate at a given distance. This is then compared against glance values and Armor Values of the Target to determine if the shot glances off with a visual market, or penetrates the Armor and scores a hit. Now in addition to kill hits, there are track hits that cause you to be unable to move and turret hits which cause you to be unable to rotate the turret. To add to this you have ammo types that can modify their target values and properties. HE for Infantry, AP which you have very few of for Armor Busting, and general shells.  Armor values are also generally weaker on the sides and rear.What all this means is that your angle, gun values, and range all factor into your success in Armor vs Armor fights. What this also means is that if you’re going up against some heavy Panzers in light British armor you’re going to have a bad day if you don’t Flank immediately. Infantry Mechanics: Infantry can be given 3 positions, standing, crouching, and prone. They are outfitted for their role on the field as general Riflemen, Snipers, AT crew, Tank Crews, and various Specialty units per each faction. Gun accuracy values are compared to the target’s use of cover and range from your position to determine hit factor. When you direct control a snipe get used to being able to quickly identify enemy AT carriers, it’ll make your life 10 times easier. Final Thoughts: If you can survive the super realism (On the scale of video games) and the micromanagement aspects. Then this is the WWII Simulator for you. However if you are on the fence about RTS in 2016 and want a more straight forward more forgiving game then I highly suggest Company of Heroes 2.As Always watch gameplay videos before buying! "

												This game makes me hate two specific groups of people.  First: big game developers who prove once again that by throwing heaps of money at promotion (I’m looking at you CoH 2) their game can outperform superior games.  And second, people who aren’t willing to put in the effort to learn a new game because it’s hard.  There is no question that MOWAS II is a thinking man’s game.  To be good you have to know armor values, penetration chances, gun calibers, and much more.  You have to invest your points in the right units, know how to use cover, and give your troops good lines of sight.  One mortar shell will kill and entire squad if you bunch them up behind a sandbag because, well, that’s reality.  Remember that veteran tiger that you saved up all game for?  You didn’t support it with infantry so it died to one AT grenade in less than 2 minutes.   It’s not CoH 2, or rather a glorified game of rock, paper, scissors, you actually have to think.  I already know people will say ‘yeah that’s all well and good but who has the time to learn all that?’ and it’s a weak argument.  If you’re going to invest a day of your life into a game anyway what is another five or six hours to learn how to play it well? The point it this is a fantastic game.  Take the time to learn it and come have some fun.			"

												It might be fun, but I'll never know. There is literally no help learning to play the game. There are some hints that give you strategies or tell you about a specific feature or two, and there is a library of YouTube videos which all explain some of the more complex tasks, but there is no tutorial, introduction, sandbox, or anything like that: you're on your own, and it's trial-and-error. That wouldn't be so bad if the game were a simplistic shooter or a more traditional Age-of-Empires-style RTS: you could guess at the controls and probably get them right enough to play. This, however, is an incredibly in-depth game with a lot of micromanagement that gives you no information about how to find or use its features. It's also a strange combination of realism (various systems on armour which can all be disabled, various weaponry with unique stats and ballistics, etc.) and absurdism (a Thompson with a range of 50 meters, 10+ hits to kill a person, etc.). Like so many others, this game completely ignores the most significant part of a game: teaching the player how to play it. If you have nothing else to do, or if you enjoy spending most of your time reading about your new game rather than playing it, you can probably learn Men of War: Assault Squad 2 in a couple days. Otherwise, skip it and wait till the publisher gets serious.			"

												Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is probably the worst gay porn I’ve played. Though it looks exciting and sounds fun, and moves hard and rapidly, it rarely gets me off.People have been saying that THIS entry in the series is supposed to be the multiplayer, coop one. And I (usually) love watching guys tongue each other’s ♥♥♥♥♥ with my friends just like everyone else does. But what if I told you that the American scenes in this collection are basically the same as the German ones, which are basically the same as the Japanese ones, which are basically the same as the British ones, and the Russian ones? All five of the nations. What if I told you that the sniper (or optionally commandos) scene for the U.S. is repeated four times with the other nations? And also the same for the defense scenes? And also the advance-across-the-set scenes? What if I told you that instead of the 40, original group sex scenes advertised on this store page, you get, actually, just 8 that are (arguably) original? And now, forget the what ifs; because it’s true.These 15 and 25 scenes are actually just eight. Different actors for each nation? Sure. But the interracial variety isn’t enough. What about the Steam Workshop mods? Well I played two of the top-rated ones, SirHinkel’s AS2 Missions and RobZ’s Base Defense ones. And they do suck ♥♥♥, but not in a good way.SirHinkel’s missions are his interpretations of famous man-on-man actions, including a very well-realized The Alamo orgy, from the epic gay porn film Saving Private Ryan. And though Italian and Hungarian men join the action during SirHinkel’s Stalingrad orgies, they’re almost all just long slogs. You can certainly set the intensity of the boning (Easy, Medium, etc.), but instead of more exciting moments of drama, you usually get merely longer scenes. And sure some people like long, hard sex scenes before the actors get so tired that, finally, they all just exhaustedly come onto each other’s throbbing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. But let’s be real: the best gay porn follows the quality-over-quantity standard. SirHinkel DID put a lot of strategic thought into his scenes, with many good placements for many dangerous toys, but as for the great climactic moments, when you just want to ejaculate while the actors do: well, they rarely happen, and (strangely) they usually do so near the beginning of his scenes. So it’s just hours of repetitive hard ♥♥♥♥ing, until it’s finally, suddenly over.As for RobZ’s base defense scenes, you look at their descriptions and think you’re in for a really good time. You start playing one and lay your initial men in comfy spots, waiting for the other nation’s uniformed-men to creep up and come on them. But it’s all ruined by what must be two bugs. Specifically: when you call in more of your dudes to join the orgy, they (infuriatingly) WALK, and unenthusiastically. And on top of or under that: these men will change their destination to wherever you tell the next boys you call in. So you have to manually look at the troops as they walk onto the scene and jerk them into running to where you actually want them. And on large set pieces, where the defenses are far from where you call in the new boys, it Just Makes Masturbation a Chore, as you move the screen across the map, clicking the walking unit, moving across the map to where you really want them, double right-clicking that spot so they run to THAT SPOT, repeat... No gay porn should soften one's ♥♥♥♥ this much...And what about the player-on-player multiplayer? Is it fun to jerk-off with someone across the Internet, or with your friend next to you? Not compared to the Company of Heroes multiplayer it isn't. MoW: ♥♥♥ Sqd 2 favors realism too much, and doesn’t understand something important about gay porn (or porn in general): Realistic Sex is not what we want to watch. I mean, for realism just go do the real thing. In pornography you want to see lots of herculean men doing all kinds of crazy ♥♥♥♥ to each other’s holes. It’s called FANTASY sex. This understanding is shown by Relic in their Company of Heroes (Vanilla edition). Men of War: Assault Squads 1 and 2 go too realistic, and thus make for undramatic man-on-man ""action,"" over and over and over.In conclusion: for gay, WW2-themed cream pies and facials, play Company of Heroes instead. (I haven’t played Company of Heroes 2; feel free to comment if you have an opinion about its ♥♥♥♥♥-rubbing-♥♥♥♥♥ action)			"

												This one of the best RTS I've ever played, but I can't recommend it, even more I encourage people to NOT buy it until the game developers make this game stable enough to play it without crashes. Right now it is nearly impossible to play it without a crash. Most mods I have played require to save at least every five minutes in order to not lost your progress on the mission.I'm sorry to have to write such a harsh review of one of the games that I like the most but it's really a shame that the developers don't take these issues seriously.

												I love this game it is one of my most favourite world war 2 strategy games and just to tell you i played the whole company of heroes series, I recommend this game because the developers actually listen to their players which can be rare to find people like these guys today, this game deserves even more players then it has right now because this game offers a-lot of content including a full campaign of the Japanese, Germans, Russian, United states of America and even the British, this game also contains a steam workshop to help boost your gameplay if you think that something needs work on, and there is also a level editor where you can remake battles that happened in real life or just make a creative battle, and the multiplayer is a blast with other players, I really think this developer deserves the best and if you don't like the price wait for the steam summer sale so you can buy it for 10 bucks and thats a very good price for a game like this!

												The game is pretty good if you are into WW2 RTS and micromanaging but there is so much that could be improved.Sadly the devs don't do the game justice. Bug fixes are few and far between for a start. But because I love the game so much I didn't mind. But the DLC are just a ripoof. Adding bots to multiplayer and the ability to save and share replys should NOT ever be paid DLC. It is like buying a car and then being charged extra for the windows. They are such basic features there is no excuse. Other companies give basic features like that as a free addon because they know it hsould be included since release. Hell, some devs even add extra content; weapons, maps, whatever (depending on game)!In vanilla I would have given it a recommend if you want a more realistic and micro managment intensive WW2 RTS than CoH2. With their attitude towards DLCs I have to say avoid.			"

												It's a decent WWII RTS. You can learn the basics in the tutorial provided and eventually start advancing once you begin the singleplayer. However, the mutiplayer is unforgiving in this game. You will be hampered, tossed around, gang banged... every match will literally become nightmare fuel for you and your teammates...I'd recommend staying away from the multiplayer as it has many vets sticking around until the day you eventually master the singleplayer or become a brilliant strategist, then give it a try...With friends for double the fun. If you're concerned about the pricing of the game, I'd suggest waiting until a sale to buy the complete edition as it includes more singleplayer missions, multiplayer bots ( only server hosts need this to enable), and more.

												Here's the deal:This game is identical in almost every aspect to the first MoW: AS. The maps are identical, the controls are identical, the UI is (mostly) identical, etc. However, the first AS is very old. If you're like me you put hundreds of hours into it by now and have probably even stopped playing it because you've done everything there was to do. I was at that point with the first one and hadn't opened it up in over three months because I was tired of it, until I saw this go on sale for 60% off. I figured ""Hey, what the hell, I get the full deluxe edition for $15 and I will be able to play Assault Squad again even if it's the same damn game."" As long as you know going into it that this is just an updated version of the first one, you will be fine and enjoy it. Do not expect anything new from the single player aspect other than a couple UI changes and (somewhat) better voice acting. The voice acting in the first one was so terrible though it wasn't hard to improve on. The only real changes are the focus on Steam and multiplayer. Steam Workshop means this game will stay fresh for a very long time with new content from users and it has all the bells and whistles of modern Steam games like cards to collect, XP to earn, in-game achievements to show off, etc. The other noticeable change is the difficulty level. Remember how ridiculously hard the first AS was on Hard mode? I literally rage quit dozens of times because the difficulty level was ABSURD. This game.. not so much. The Hard mode feels like Normal mode from AS. Heroic here is basically Hard mode there. This is a good thing in my opinion because it now allows hardcore fans like me to earn Heroic achievements because they were unattainable in the first. I wouldn't even try Heroic mode in the original one because I figured the AI had pocket nuclear missiles and a time machine to warp stealth fighters and gauss cannons back to beat my ♥♥♥ with. If you ever completed the single-player campaign from AS on Heroic mode, you should write a book about your endeavor and send me a copy. TL;DRUpdated version of the first game. Difficulty turned down a few notches. Get this on sale and don't expect a whole new game. "

												Game is very strategic and skill based. The single player is kind of lack luster but it makes up for it in the multiplayer. Some things that are unique are the direct control feature where you can control your units movements and gun. You can do this on any unit in the game and it really dodges any problems you would have with Ai not going exactly where you want them or shoot where you want. Vehicle fighting is fun because they don't just have a health bar, they have components on them that can be damaged and need to be repaired. When fighting a heavy tank that your gun can't pin, if you flank around the side of it you might be able to pin through the weaker side armor, it adds a very fun game mechanic. It does require a lot of micro but that is part of the fun.			"

												Great Game. In its current stage, however, it is buggy and clunky. It has potential, but I would currently recommend COH2 over this game simply because of gamplay. For one, the AT guns (on all sides) are not very functional. I was in a game with a friend and the guns literally wouldn't fire at any of the tanks. Furthermore, when I ordered them to fire, they ran outside the house they were in, straight into machine gun fire. All of them were killed. If the creators fixed game mechanics, I would definitely buy into it. Second, the level up system is bullcrap. Just give the players access to all units. It just makes no sense to me why you wouldn't do that --- this is a strategy game, so why throw in random crap that casual players may never get to? Overall the game is just clunky and feels incomplete --- fix those problems, and I'll buy into it. Regardless, this game is still ok. I would recommend most steam users hold off and wait till it's cheaper, however.  "

Men Of War, while very fun, can be frustrating as all get out; If you have a hard time multi-tasking, making snap decisions or Manuvering, this may not be the game for you. If you can and enjoy this, then by all means grab the game during the next steam sale and give it a try. Here are the main Pros and cons I found with MOWAS2   PROS: -Wonderful game engine             -Excellent graphics(Even on low)              -Difficult but rewarding Gameplay             -An editor that allows you to do anything you want from changing maps, level building, even goofing around             -Can run on a pretty weak system(2.0ghz is the lowest)CONS: -Can be Challanging multiplayer (which is to be expected) ESPECIALLY against Multiplayer Vets            -Not as much as the first MOW, but the AI can occaisonally goof up (My medic got out of cover to run to a wall, peek then run back)            -To play offline against bots, the Airborn DLC is required			"

												I love this game, base game is a good introduction and is fun and helps you understand the different sides with there strengths and weaknessess. Where this game trully shines is in the modding there is a very large amount of skins maps full mods that make the game very replayable. Controls are good as well, takes some time learning the menus , repairing, controlling, etc. There is also an editor where you can make youre own maps and upload them to the steam workshop or keep it for youre self. There is also multiplayer which is fun with friends or randoms which offers a competitive experience on regular or modded maps. pros: -Good gameplay - fun co op online experience  -good amount of content in base game   -modding is amazing and has a great amount of content to offer from the great commuity  -offers a fun and enjoyable experience cons: -takes a srong computer to run high settings  - units get stuck sometimes (mostly in modded maps)Overall this game is fun and enjoyable and can appeal to many people with its large amout of mods and awesome battles Hope this review was helpful!

												After the kind of shaky launch I can now finally recommend the game. Optimization has greatly improved as well as a bunch of new and much requested features such as bots and replay system. These along is enough for most series veteran to get back to the game. Both features will also help new players pick up the game much easier.All in all, AS2 is an excellent iteratation of the Men of War series, please buy it to support the fine folks at DMS who really did a good job of supporting all their games.

												This game is both the best ww2 title out there and the worst disaster of a game at the same time.  It holds some great game elements as well as some absolute game design disasters. It is sad to see so much potential getting wasted.First, the good stuff:Let me begin by saying this: After playing this game for a bit, other titles like Company of Heroes really started to look like jokes.Both infantry and armor gameplay are awesome.The multiplayer game experience in itself is awesome. No other words for it. It has a very good tempo. The stakes are always high. So much can change in a split second. The balance between infantry and armor is top notch. The arcade element is there and it rewards good play. The best part is, this game is doing all this while keeping a very good amount of realism and detail.All the factions that the game comes with. Like, really. I see so many people complaining about AI not being free. Ok maybe thats wrong but you guys realize that this is pretty much one of the few ww2 titles that comes with five factions right? Thats gotta mean something.The mod support. There are mods featuring even the tiniest of ww2 factions. Wanna play as french in 1940? you got it. Would you prefer to play as Poland? Sure thing! You want the game to be much more spectacular and realistic? Tired ot the games linear and unimaginative skirmishes? Do you want to play with star wars factions? Hell, do you want a mod of a weeb anime about schoolgirls and tanks? You have it all. With all the mods there are out there, the vanilla game feels like a mere demo of the full experience. And make no mistake, the vanilla game still has a lot of content.Yeah, it sounds awesome right, Now for the bad stuff:Multiplayer matchmaking system. It's not just bad, it practically doesn't exist. You don't have any way to just hop in and play, you have to host a game, wait for people to join in (which takes so much as 20 minutes sometimes) and you have no idea if they are in your level or not. It can be a nice competitive match or just an absolute massacre. This is the result of trying to implement restricted units and having downright unimaginative stupid map designs for current ingame matchmaking system. A game like this shoud have had dedicated matchmaking for individual mods.Too many settings for multiplayer. This is not supposed to be a problem, but when the matchmaking is broken, some people will never learn about the proper balanced settings of the game.The skirmishes are linear and repetitive. If you want good single player content you have to go to the workshop.The difficulty setting of the skirmishes are downright ridiculous. I mean seriously, changing damage infantry takes? I mean how dimwitted you have to be for not realising doing that changes the game's mechanics completely? Being able to run at a mechinegun fire just kills the games experience and gives the beginners wrong expectations about everything. Not to mention that it defeats the whole purpose of having a single player campaign which is primarily educating the player for full multiplayer experience.Infantry animations look cheap. It is the first thing most of the newcomers will notice and it doesn't hold up with the rest of the game.Bugs and out of sync issues. Which is much better by now but having constant out of snyc problems for more than year after the launch is pretty bad. Along with the broken matchmaking, this is the reason why so few people play it today.DLCs are not well thought out. Seriously, mods are better.The developers of this game made a great product but somehow it seems like they don't really understand what makes it so great. And they don't seem to understand some of the most fundamental gamer expectations. All that said, I would still recommend this game. Even with all the dlc's the price is a bloody steal for all the content it provides. BUT keep in mind that its rough around some of the edges that it really shouldn't have been.			"

												Is this game 10 times better than company of heroes?   YESI am soooo tiered of games that the units engage in combat with auto hit system (al la starcraft) so it turns into a health bar drainage with not to hit or miss possiblity. Basically an rts water balloon fight to see what unit counters what and drains health bars quicker than other units as the main focus. The person who click manages the build system is the one who comes out on top usually. None of that here...each unit is spawned based on objectives like coh but more realistic. Each unit has a personal name, gain experience based on performance, and have attritional statistical values that contribute to a hit or miss attack as well as variable damage. Each section of the map is an all encompassing campain, not a region that loads once you arrive there trigering the ai at that monment to take action. THIS GAME IS FANTASTIC ...HOWEVER....Biggest complaint tho with this game....WHY IN THE HELL Do THE UPDATES KILL THE PREVIOUS SAVES!!!EFFECTIVLY THIS GAME IS BROKEN! you will never get through the campain before they pull a mandatory update again one day and render all of your previous saves unreadable! its the single most rediculous thing ever. In fact I dont know a game that does that. But yeah, You will continually have to start from the beginning with the way its set up. loose all your  hard work and experienced units that carry over to the the next fight becuase they dont know how to code the saves to work with new versions of the game once its updated. so you just loose it all!

I regret none of my purchases, even games ive played less, even Dark souls!! but this one, I feel like i do. To skip all my gripes, to sum it up, dont buy this game till its like 10 dollars, NOT ENOUGH CONTENT. Idk if its just the ridiculous difficulty of it, or the annoyance have having to resupply every single unit every time they run out of ammo, or maybe its the ridiculous paths your units take (ie running around the entire front side of a trench admist enemy fire to get into cover, maybe its the seemingly indesctructible enemy super tanks, or the horrible Multiplayer ping, maybe its having to babysit a unit so it acts half compitent, or being unable to adjust the map so u can actually understand the terrain so your not left wondering why the hell your At just sat there as an enemy tank wiped out all your units, idk if its the difficulty, or just all of those things:/ E			"

												I have been quite the fan of Men of War. I love RTS and I love WWII, so its perfect for me. One thing to note is that this game can be incredibly complex. The amount of micro you CAN put into this game can be quite insane. Every single unit has an inventory, ammunition, tanks/vehicles have fuel that runs out. It can all be resupplied from trucks or dead troops or vehicles. This game is tons of fun and extremely realistic. There really isnt much of a singleplayer campaign/story its more of just challenge skirmishes that you can play by yourself or with friends. Do not get me wrong it can be incredibly fun. This game takes time to learn, but it is one of the most rewarding gaming experiances ever. I love it. Here is the difficult thing, it really isnt much of a step up from the first Men of War Assault Squad. Yes they included all the DLC maps that they sold to people in the first one, and there are new units and it handles slightly better than its predecessor but not by much. The game is in need of a new engine badly, the games engine cannot handle how complex the physics are. Other than that if you are aware that it really isnt a sequel but more of an update/expansion? I guess and you know what your getting into then go for it pick it up. Other than that don't buy it unless its on a sale if you have the first.8.5/10			"

												Its the exact same as Assault Squad 1.  All the same skirmish missions with a few extra added in that are new.  It says that in the description and I knew this but I thought they would at least revamp the old missions and add a greater selection of units that they added.  Instead I must trudge through the old missions to get to the new.  The other thing I do not like at all about either game is that each skirmish mission for each country is EXACTLY the same format.  A little variety here and there and perhaps a bit more uniqueness when it comes to the different countries would be fantastic.  Things that feature the strengths and weaknesses of a country perhaps.  I just cannot recommend this game but if you do not have either and absolutely want to buy it then do not get both 1 and 2.  As 2 is all you would need and should have been the only one released.

												I think the series is doing really bad with the new small updates that cost 30+ Euro, also if you want to play with AI and have fun you have to buy the DLC, if you can't then you just try to find a lobby which takes several hours due to the horrible community that doesn't want you to play the game and loves kicking people instead of playing the hosts just really love sitting in pre game lobby for several hours. Also ranking up in this game is hard because developers implemented a new feature called Dsync probably the only feature that affects games the most other then the new GUI.What I want from the next Installment is a new Men of War game, maybe Men of War 2 that isn't a copy from 2003 with less features and more problems. I hope Best Way developes the next Men of War instead of the current kids tweaking the past 4 Men of War games they would of been a much better game if they used a new engine or upgraded the current one in a noticible way, the only upgrade I see in AS2 is bad AI and Dsyc.

												I played almost all MOW games since before they were released on steam and i didn't saw great engine or AI improvements yet. All these new MOW's coming out just seem as big DLC's of basic MOW. Just like Red Tide. Was it really necessary to make a full game about the red army in WW2? That is just a standalone DLC that should cost like 5 dollars. AS2 just looks like AS with more glitches , random crashes , sync errors , editor random crashes etc....

Early Access Review
								I was in the main, interested in pre 20th Century warfare and played games accordingly.  Having become very disillusioned with a well known companies latest RTS game which I had been waiting for...for many years, I went out looking for a replacement just to keep me occupied until they got their act together and put it right.  Looking through my old games I resurrected MOWAS1, played a few games and really enjoyed myself.  Then noticed that MOWAS2 was being released in Beta during March 2014, read the blurb and signed up and duly paid my monies for the Deluxe edition...  Since then I have never looked back, I have loved every bit of the 140 odd hours played (that equates to less than £0.15p per hour), and it hasnt even been officially released yet.  Sure there are glitches (still Early Access when writing this post), but they will be resolved. the single play and Co-op has been envigorating and have made many new friends to wile away the hours with.

												     This is a fun and challenging game. It strikes a perfect balance between depth, challenege and fun gameplay. It takes some patience to master and when you get proficient you feel like you really accomplished something beating a map on hard mode. Not many games allow for amazing things to happen. For example I forced a crew member out of a tank under machine gun fire to fix a track. In my head it was a death sentence. As soon as he jumped out that tank got hit and the remaining crew blew out the top! Another time a soldier was cooking a grenade, got killed and his grenade went off next to him! Just little things like that make this game make you ""wow! that just happened."" These don't seem strange until you realise it is a RTS and it is those little things that are amazing. Very detailed to say the least.			"

												The developers say Men of War 2? I say Men of War...Again. TL;DR - great game, not a new one though. The latest installment of the Men of War series offers...the same as the first. aside from a few graphical fidelity tweaks, some small mechanic improvementsn and a few additions here and there, i would not title this as anything other than a remaster. All the changes i see in this game couldve been updates for the first, I daren't say it warrants a whole new game. I understand that my hours arent in the hundreds, but after playing the first one and budging myself into buying the second, im not really seeing a difference. At all. I'll keep it short and simple. For those who own the first men of war, you don't gain anything from buying this one. Of course, this game allows multiplayer, as the first one had its servers shut down. But if you're looking for a new singleplayer experience, you won't find it here. It is the same game, with the same missions, and the same features. Some are brushed up a little, but still the same. For those who don't. I would definitely recommend this. it's great, don't be disheartened by the developpers lack of change from the first game. Because the first one was and still is a gem. To summarise, if you're new, go for it. Love the depth of this game and really explore it. If you aren't, save the money, reinstall the first one and be done with it. EDIT: for those of you saying 'IT HAS AN EDITOR THOUGH' yes. It does. correct. But back to my original point, does the addition of an editor really need a WHOLE 'new' release?			"

												MOWAS2 the great successor of the old soldier heroes of ww2. No RTS or RTT can get even close to this game. It is almost simulation with lot of physics in it. It keeps you stunned in so many ways. It is real, serious, competitive and beautiful. It lacks the use of planes in multiplayer, I wish it has some of order of war features in this regard. This game is the best ww2 themed game ever made and worth every penny. It is one of my favorite games. If you are a fan of arcades, animation with no military knowledge this game is made for soldiers and tacticians avoid it.			"

												This game is in dire need of a tutorial, the gameplay is advanced and simple ""Buy big tank, win game"" thought processes do not work, which is probably why so many newcomers get turned off from it. Everything is vulnerable in this game, the units are as historically accurate as possible and the developer is constantly rolling out updates and improvements to balance the online interactions between all of the factions. The direct control element of this game is one of the greatest gameplay mechanics ever for an RTS game that allows you to singlehandedly turn the tide of any game.TL:DRPros: Rich GameplayHistoically accurateIntuitiveSandbox feel allows for creative solutions to battlefield problemsConstant developer tweaks to balance and additional units added for free (RE: No DLC needed)Direct Control element unheard of in RTS that singlehandedly puts this game above other RTSCons:Immense learning curve that the singleplayer elements don't prepare you forLong times in lobby getting a game togetherUnforgiving (Salty) community that expects you to understand gameplay mechanics not taught by the game			"

												This is clearly a highly emmersed and well thought out game. While playing it for free (before I bought it on sale) I had in one skirmish to go fix up a special tank behind enemy lines. While the enemys did crush me time and time again, I then learned I could tell the tank crew fixing the tank with a repair kit to pick up a bazooka and shoot the enemy tanks that were bothering me. The fact that I could pick up any old equiptment dropped by allied/enemy soldiers and blow up buildings just by driving my tank through them was astounding, and I've loved the game ever since.			"

												MOWAS2 the great successor of the old soldier heroes of ww2. No RTS or RTT can get even close to this game. It is almost simulation with lot of physics in it. It keeps you stunned in so many ways. It is real, serious, competitive and beautiful. It lacks the use of planes in multiplayer, I wish it has some of order of war features in this regard. This game is the best ww2 themed game ever made and worth every penny. It is one of my favorite games. If you are a fan of arcades, animation with no military knowledge this game is made for soldiers and tacticians avoid it.			"

												I wish I could recommend this game for it is a totally unique ww2 rts game with all sorts of fun interaction and destroyable enviroments with a whole bunch of different units.It's still a great joy when your tank gets destroyed and the men inside have to get out, now what do you do? You won't win any fight against an enemy tiger with a pistol. But oh wait! you can look inside your tank and take some dynamite out of it. Now just take direct control of your guy and run like a maniac or sneak behind The enemy tank and just place that dynamite right on there and watch the fireworks happen. There is a lot of value in this game if you can look past a lot of issues which are: bad user interface, horrible micro management of your units, sometimes laggy gameplay, even game breaking bugs. And if you play this game without Robz Realism or GSM mod you are going to have a bad time with damage modeling being just plain awful, artillery range being weak like a potato gun and tanks going slower than a snails pace. I really would not recommend playing without one of those mods.Multiplayer works most of The time quite well if players have good internet connection and pc's. It's easy to get matches happening since there are a small community of dedicated players. You can set up all sorts of custom rules for your games too. Since I like to play with Robz Realism modification The online matches can sometimes end in a game breaking bug if you have lots of units that have broken down and created all sorts of clutter and destroyed buildings and so on. I think it's because the game engine was not meant to be designed for that much stuff on the battlefield at once. Luckily this only happens in really large battles and personally I really don't enjoy the kind of games where there is just too much points available to spend on a thirty tanks and fifteen batallions of troops at once.There are a lot of content available for this game but the developers have made patches to The game that render some of The steam workshop content unplayable with The latest version. There are a lot of custom campaigns that can be played in co-op too. You can even find a total conversion that gives The game a modern military theme. I would not recommend bying at full price since I don't think The developers are going to patch this much further anymore.			"

Use a coupon or wait for a sale, and when you have the chance to get the game for less than 10 bucks, you should probably buy it. As long as you like strategic war games.High detailed battle field, destructible buildings and trees. Fire a mortar shell in a house and crush your enemy with flying debris or a falling tree. Capture an enemy tank and repair it. Most units have an inventory to carry ammo, weapons and repair kits, search fallen soldiers and abandoned vehicles for such items.+ Tooltips and autosave- Interaction with units is sometimes a bit difficult, but you get used to that9.8/10 "

												One of the best strategy games I have ever played. Being extremely tactical and realistic, it is also quite difficult; even the ammo assigned to each individual soldier is to be kept under control!Tank battles are far more realistic than they are in other similar games; vehicles can be crewed and uncrewed, damages depend on the kind of shell, on the distance from the target and on the hit part. Covers are nice, and it is possible to control the soldiers' stance (standing up, prone and so on) manually. Enemy vehicles, if abandoned and not completely destroyed, can be recovered and stolen. Anti tank guns are really effective against tanks, but there is always a certain amount of randomness which makes everything unpredictable and suspencing. Every action has to be planned accurately, and unreasoned and silly moves are very likely to cause disastrous outcomes; there is a nice reinforcements mechanism which depends on the controlled checkpoints, and new weapons are available on the field after a new checkpoint has been conquered.The only bad thing is that, during multiplayer battles, reinforcements are automatically split among players, causing messy situations (""who called this sniper?"" ""Can I have your Panzer, or you desperately need it?""). It is possible to send units to an ally player, but this takes time and can be pretty annoying.			"

												This game is a bit of a conundrum for me. On the one hand I love playing it, and Co-Op is my thing. Using clever tactics and wits to fight your enemies is very gratifying. Online vs. players is wonderful but honestly I just suck too much at it to have a ton fun. On the other hand the AI is LAME, like they spent about 20 minutes on it and decided that since it went places automatically then it was fine. I miss the cool maps and missions of the old Men of War games. Still, because of the entrenched enemies and the constantly annoying reinforcement of tanks and things it’s still challenging to play with online. This game is a ton of fun and I would suggest this game to anyone.			"

												Great game. Not only is it a tactical rts, but it does it's best to be realistic, with accurate Fog of War and Line of Sight. Allowing you to take personal control of each unit is a bonus as well. If I had to critisize something, it would be the controls, they can be a bit confusing at first, but are pretty easy to learn quickly.			"

												This game is purely amazing. It's realistic RTS is very fun and engaging. I always love to go into this game and control a Panther or a Tiger and do some serious damage on American or Russian lines! The campain is amazing as well, the story isn't that interesting but it's definnatly something to give a try. But what makes this game so amazing is the multiplayer. Fight your friends and foes in some awesome battles on historical maps across europe and russia! I will forever recommend this game to all of my friends that enjoy RTS.			"

												Pros:-Great game and great gameplay-Destruction system(how buildings fall,you can destroy everything to the ground)-Lots of SP missions(even if they are copied versions for all nations) and achievements on every difficulty level-I Love tank/vehicle battles in this game-Experience/level unlock system-Tanks/Antiair 20mm machineguns used on infantry :) they dying like they should not like in other stupid games (CoH)-Damage system is great - tank is a tank not like in company of heroes where squad survives 10 tank cannon shells and    escape to forest,then back after moment and destroying your tank...-5 Nations with lots of different vehicles for all of them :many tanks,AA machineguns,cannons,howitzers,self-propelled howitzers,jeeps,support trucks,stationary machineguns/mortars and many infantry units-Many extra/bonus units for all nations available to call after some time of playing(different for any nation)-Multiple units and especially vehicles makes game a ULTRA interesting for me-Good looking vehicles explosions with flying parts and nice smoke but fire from explosions(in moment when howitzer  shell explode on ground) need to be reworked(looks poor)-Good PriceCons:-MOST IMPORTANT; MATCHMAKING for ranked games not working so new players cant get any place in ladder,cant do some achievements and cant make their stats ""fat""...-SP missions need a story : I not need any render movies but even on loading screen there no explanation about the mission,SP need much more  in-game cutscenes in simple words : A REAL STORY with small differences between nations...-MOST IMPORTANT:Game needs extensive statistics not only for ranked games(which not working) but for skirmish with AI too...Anything from those battles not save to stats,only exp and level for nation...I want stats like infantry killed,vehicle destroyed,games won,W/L ratio with AI,same with lost units and even a list How many kills players get in career with all specified vehicles(a list of all vehilces: page per nation with all stats of all vehicles) - because if no advanced stats what is the reason to play game if no friend whos playing this game,ranked games dont work and you dont get anything from playing !?!? I love making my game stats ""fat"" but in this title nothing saves to those stats except exp and level....-Need more unlocks - dev should add  some camoflauges for vehicles - some different versions snow/desert itc...-Game need a better textures for some infantry models			"

												Very good real-time strategy. It reflects the realities of World War 2 Moreover, the fate of the game can change even one soldier I can recommend 100%!Of course, as every game has its pros and cons to mention below.+ Strong emphasis on realism extra game is not easy is quite difficult and you have to toil.+ Extensive vehicles with their damage, destruction, fuel, ammo which changes the very gameplay.+ The ability to use the workshop+ Models destruction and good physics+ A large variety of units.+ Unusual multiplayer games.-Very Unfriendly game for beginners, both in playing the game and in the editor.- Frequent crashes.- Poor optimization of even the most powerful computers strong explosion is able to do the problem computer.-Very Poor singleplayer campaign (fortunately, with the help of steam comes workshop)In my opinion 8/10 because you have to remember that the game is in Beta and is still developing.

												I've had this game for a long time and even had some fun with it when I first purchased it but then I drifted back to Company of Heroes 2 as usual. On a whim I fired up MOW AS2 today and had an absolute blast with it. This is a must play for WWII and RTS enthusiasts. It's challenging. Absolute tons of micromanaging to be done here but when you start getting it and making combined arms tactics work it is thrilling. Honestly, it's a difficult game to master and I'm not there yet but if you want a challenge this is your game. The graphics on ultra settings are very very nice and the game's presentation is more ""realistic"" if I can use that word than Company of Heroes. Performance is a little uneven which is understandable with everything that's going on. It's crazy how many moving parts there are here so a respectable processor is recommended. I have what currently is the flagship AMD APU the A10 7850k OC'ed to 4.5ghz paired with an R9 285 and 32gb of ram (design) and when there's a lot of concentrated artillery, infantry and vehicle movement it can run in the low 20's though I wouldn't say it makes the game unplayable. I probably should mess around with the shadows and post processing to see if I can improve that but for the most part the game runs well. Obviously your experience will vary and if you're on a laptop or older desktop then be prepared to make serious sacrifices in the graphics settings. I should probably mention that there's no proper campaign, it's more a series of disconnected battles vs. the CPU but I didn't feel the game suffered because of a lack of narrative. If you like WWII you get the context and you can fill in the blanks yourself without having a character driven story line. Well, that's it. If you're reading this at all it's because you're interested so pull the trigger. It's a great game 9/10.			"

												At first I was completely frustrated and thought this game was way too hard to enjoy.  But - once I got the hang of how to use your units together (and keep them stocked with ammo) this became one of the biggest time sucks that's happened at my house in a very long time.  Lots of detail, lots of variety, and the physics system works very well.  As soon as you've taken that victory point, some far-reaching artillery will remind you that what got you here sure as heck won't get you to the next one.  And if you think you'll overpower the enemy with a tank rush, well - just try it.  If Company of Heroes is high school, the MOWAS2 is a graduate degree program. Get it on sale.			"

												I know more people that have played Company of Heroes than Men of War, which is a shame because Men of War is to Company to Heroes what Arma is to Battlefield. GameplayFirst off: Men of War is a squad based WW2 Strategy Game. The game does not offer any base building but is centered around capturing command posts, which give you points, that you can then use to request squads of soldiers, tanks, airstrikes and the likes. Infantry Combat Every soldier in Men of War comes with his own inventory and his own weapons, which makes micromanagement a must. Troops need to remain supplied with ammunitions, bandages and grenades throughout the engagements which can either be scavenged from fallen enemies (or friends) or vehicles. Furthermore every weapon has its own advantages: SMGs are for medium and short range engagements, rifles for long ranges, LMGs to supress areas, sniper rifles, flamethrowers, pistols. You can move units individually or group them together in a squad depending on the situation.Vehicle Combat Like infantry tanks have an inventory too. Unlike infantry, tanks also have different armor levels on all sides. Distance to tank, angle of shot, projectile used, and where the shell hits all make the difference between an AT shell that deflects off the tanks armor or disables one of its critical systems (turret, main gun, left or right tread, hull or motor). Remember that scene in Fury where the crew outmaneuvers a German Tiger? This game lets you do that.Personal Control At any point in time you can push E and personally control a unit from the strategic view using WASD and your mouse. I personally wished it was in third person, but whatever. So if tank-mc-gee isn't doing what you want you can just take him over and position him yourself. Which brings me to my next point:The environment: Men of War features very detailed countrysides, cities, and industrial maps which are all completely destructible. Tanks can drive through walls, explosions will destroy windows, vegetation can burn to the ground. A house can shield the flanks of your tank until a cannon lands a shot through the kitchen window. All vehicles, whether destroyed or not, can serve as cover to your units. Same is true for trenches, trees and sandbags (which will provide cover until they're blown apart).Overall I think Men of War is the best squad based RTS out there. The level of realism is insane, the campaings are fun to play with friends (up to 8 player coop). Men of War 2 is more of a re-make of Men of War 1 but definitely adds some things like shared ammunition among squads and new scenarios. I can only recommend this game.			"

												If your a big fan of World War II games, or if you simply enjoy a good real time strategy, Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is definitely for you. Providing the player with five single-player campaigns and armies, Men of War is literally full of different units all of which are unique and are more or less historically accurate. The game always keeps you in strategic dicision making, and the direct firing control which was first introduced in Soldiers Heroes of World War II (a very old but awesome predecessor of this here fine title) makes tank duels an unmatched experience which you won't find in any other comparable RTS (like CoH 2 for an example). What really makes this game valuable and gives many hours of gameplay is the multiplayer. There are many different maps and a decent amount of players. Due to the in-game physics, armor penetration chances, infantry maneuvers, gamestyles of the players, every match is never the same, so every single battle always becomes a new, unpredictable challange. The game also has many modes, so you can always play the one which fits your style, with strategic point control, casual combat and even cooperative missions all being present for you to enjoy. While competing in online battles, the player has the opprotunity to choose his own style of play. Tanks, infantry and artillery all fulfil their crucial roles in order to achieve victory, and all types of units require an individual commanding approach. Multiplayer is undoubtedly the most apparent upside of AS2. Since the GEM engine is rather old, the graphics in this multiplayer strategy are a bit below the standards, especially if we start comparing this title to Company of Heroes 2. This, however, is compensated by the scale of the battlefields which are present in this game, with explosions and complete destruction of in-game objects all contributing to an astonishing overall image of war as it is shown in Assault Squad 2. In spite of graphics not being the bestest quality of this RTS, they are nevertheless pleasant to look at. The textures are neat, the models of the vehicles are very detailed, explosions and visual effects are dynamic, thus commiting to credibility. Out of anything more negative, i can only note the models and textures of the infantry, which haven't been updated since 2006 when Faces of War came out. In general, Men of War: Assault Squad 2 can be recommended to anyone who wants to play a good quality WW2 RTS with a well developed multiplayer.  "

												i literally have to give this a ""Not Recommended""... why? let me explain.... before? i would have said to buy it, even if you own AS1... sort of a waste of money, but at least no third party multi-player. ( AS1 should have been integrated into steam servers after gamespy closed all servers for all games they supported... but hey, screw that, charge the same players for another game if they want online features )EVEN before i'd say buy this even with it being the EXACT same game as AS1, just ... horribly optimized? somehow my computer can play AS1 no problem. but AS2 dominated my computer....? when they're the same game? no, i don't understand either.but then..... they did the WONDERFUL ""Game update 3.112.0"" and this has destroyed the game for me. not only does it run EVEN worse on my computer, to the point that any co-op is impossible even with having very fast internet.... but NOW???NOW... you have NO supplies in trucks. no ammo, no anything. oh wait, grenades...? cool? yeah, not really...i loved preparing for an assault, stocking my soldiers up with ammo then heading out. now? you can just put 5 grenades on each person and ... nothing else. i hope you like grenades, because that's all you'll be getting.before, you could unload shells from trucks and make IED's. now, obviously you can't. your troops get a magical resupply of ammo from trucks. even the officer supply drop was ruined. no rifle ammo, no SMG ammo, no MG ammo. your troops can just fire all day and get resupplied from a small paradrop. it makes NO sense and just kills this game for me. the realism is thrown out the window. sir hinkel, as i'm sure anyone that plays AS1 or AS2 knows of... ( if you don't, he makes missions for the German Soldier's Mod, which is amazing as are his missions ) made scripts that resupply your troops with crates / trucks. you can watch the ammo going from the truck / crate, and going into your soldiers inventory. it only resupplies to a set number. so 100 rifle rounds, 300 SMG, 1000 MG....yet the developers somehow did worse than..... a random person using Gem Editor? are you SERIOUS? someone working for free / fun made resupply amazing yet people making LOTS OF MONEY FAIL!?!?!i've held off on this for a few months now. there's no difference..... i bought AS2 ONLY to support this company for making games that have realism. now? NO. ( stupid me, i even bought the Deluxe Edition to support this company )sure, video games are all fantasy, even simulators........but this just destroyed it. this game is not ""early access"" or alpha, or beta, or ANYTHING else. it's the complete game, and they ruined it for me...yes, yes... i know, huge long rant about one thing, but it offended me this much. i even posted to developers......no response. nothing. this is the only reason i waited for the negative review. in hopes they'd see and fix this horrible thing they've done.because of this, i truly can't recommend that you spend ...any money on this, let alone 29.99$ ( as of this moment )just buy assault squad 1 for a lesser price tag... unless you are REALLY devoted to multi-player and don't want to use third party programs for it.seriously... AS1 is a master-piece and there are a lot of cool scripts and other things you can use to make awesome missions yourself. it's not hard, just need to spend some time on it. i'd be happy to help anyone learn how to use things in Gem Editor, especially for AS1. ( also AS1 will run better on your computer, no matter how good.... or crappy your computer may be )hmmm also, if anyone thinks ""only 21.6 hours?"" or anything... look at my play time for AS1, 358 hours as of today, and it ""may"" be my favorite game...ever. that's why i know AS2 is a huge slap in the face to anyone who has played the men of war games. ( if not going even further back with faces of war and even further back... )IF and ONLY IF developers put ammo into trucks and crates again will i give this a positive review, and i'd even suggest you pay 29.99$. it's really not a bad game, seeing as it's close to a direct copy / paste of AS1... just doesn't run as smoothly.LET ME MAKE IED'S AGAIN!!! >;(			"

												If you want a new kind of stategy game this is the one!              I've never seen any other like it, but then again i haven't really looked once i found this gem.And the mods to the game are great!You will have to check them out! THE CONS.1,Might take a bit to get good(don't give up)2. Need to LEARN how to direct fire with certain things(direct fire is where you control the person/tank/arty yourself)3. finding a game online at certain times is hard. sometimes its a lot of russains, sometimes its more experinced people (not always bad but if they stack and you're new you wont learn a lot.) but try and copy what they did! it will work sometimes.4. playing on lower setting when online. if you want to run smooth and not get kicked. make sure your performence is the best it can be. i have a good computer and i still play on medium settings just to have 4 bars of performence(which is best)MAIN CON (5. OUT OF SYNC Errors. i've only have these errors about 4 times and 3 were when i was playing mods. i might just be luck to not get these every game or what. But i've finished most of my games,) and this con makes a lot of people hate this gameThese are the top cons i think of, but you can overcome 4/5 of them! And this games a Great experince i wouldn't pass up. and if you are scared to spend the money, just wait till the pack is on sale to buy it. "

												Wow this game is awesome.Well first of all I would say the game is a rts game but where you do not have to ""rush"" from a-b.You can often take your time to scout and plan your attack or defence.What I like about the game is the amount of detail.For example you can drive a tank and your self shoot the enemy.One of the really cool things about the game is that every vehicle are different.. For example it does matter where and how you shoot the enemy tank.Another thing i like is that your troops can pickup different weapons if the for example run out of ammunition. Yes you can even use the enemys AT gruns and even tanks if you are lucky enough that the crew bail out, then you can sometimes repair it and use it.Defensive possitions and the world in general also offer various advantages or disadantages.In general I like the game and it is pretty cool.I have so far only completed the introduction mission 1 and it took 1 hour 45 minutes. I did not count the amount of missions but I would say 30+ so there are many houres of combat if you like to just play against the computer.. If you like there is also multiplayer but I did not yet try this.Edit..:  If you want to play against ""bots"" in your own multiplayer skirmish mode, then bots AI are not included as standard in the game ( dooh )  But when buying ""airborn"" then the ""bots AI"" computer player will be unlocked... Just thought I mention this.I hope the future of the series might evolve into a game with a virtuel 2d map where we can move troops arround on a strategic map, and then fight the entire war in a kind of virtual campaign taking place in zones that look like european contrys.. .. Well the campaign system should work like in ""wargame dragon"". For examle if you move an infantry unit to ""denmark"" and the enemy move inf+light tanks then you as the player have to fight that battle with only infantry avaliable... The amount of killed units should after the battle be updated on the campaign map and once example the enemys infantry battalion is destroyed then it should be dead for the rest of the war.... however taking various key points on the campaign map should allow the player to get a fre units of reinforsment during the campaign, and the enemy vise vesa... Well that would be pretty cool to play the game like that i think. Who know maybe we could get airplanes and ships also.			"

												Almost my whole squad was mowed down by a machinegunner.I took control of the last surviving member of the squad, healed him and equipped him with some of it's dead teammates weapons and completed the mission with him.10/10 would Rambo againBut seriously, it's a WWII realtime strategy game with more realistic mechanics than for example Company of Heroes. Each soldier is truly an individual with his own health and inventory (which you can modify). You can squad them up and move them as a squad or send each individual to a specific location.Ammunition and fuel run out and you have to resupply your forces, you can micromanage each individual soldier or do it as a squad.Tank mechanics are a bit different than soldier mechanics. Tanks don't have healthbars. Instead, if you for example destroy the engine or turret, it can't drive or move it's turret respectively. The penetration mechanics are also more realistic. If you play Warthunder, it's a simplified version of the one you're used to in Ground Forces. Tanks, as do all vehicles, must be crewed by soldiers. The crew can be knocked out. If a tank doesn't have a gunner, it can't aim and fire it's gun. The crew will automatically try to fill the most vital spots, so it's possible to have a tank with one crewmember that switches between seats as needed, although this is of course far less efficient than a fully crewed tank. But one of the most interesting features is the ability to 'ASSUME DIRECT CONTROL'of a soldier or vehicle. Making it a sort of top-down 3D shooter..thingamajigger.When I'm playing a singleplayer game I often get the feeling I'm a small part of a large scale battle. You usually get control over a squad or two and sometimes some vehicles. And when you force a breakthrough, your allies will pour through it and take advantage of it.And there is also a powerful map editor that is easy to understand, so there are a lot of maps made available by skilled editors.TL;DR Buy this game or bad things will happen to your pet ostrich named George V.

												I like the game, however the AI is disgustingly bad. AI leaving squadmates behind. AI wont pick up weapons when told to. AI running into enemy fire. AI running into friendly vehicles. AI running away from vehicles, but they don't bother to put themselves back in cover. AI getting stuck- they even sometimes get stuck outside of the map when they are coming into play, rendering them useless for the rest of the game.You are able to take manual control of units, but you can only do so much. Take too much time trying to get your tank unstuck and the enemy will break through your lines. You have to juggle fixing your units and fighting very often.DLCs are also pretty bad.I do like RTS games very much but I can't bear to work with AI that can't walk themselves down an allyway.			"

												I loved Men of War Assault Squad, it was a great alternative to something like CoH. I've always wanted Men of War Assault Squad 2 and have just recently bought it whilst it is on sale. To be honest, I think that it is a bit rich to call this game a sequal of even a bit stupid to call it Men of War Assault Squad TWO. This just feels like an expansion pack for the first game seeing as they have bought maps back form the previous title to make it look like there are more maps. It just feels a bit cheap for them to do that. The visuals have ever so slightly improved, but there is the same voice acting, menu screen, HUD, death animations, basically look at the last title and everything from that is in this game. I really do fail to see what makes this a new game from the old one. There are some slight differences like the character models and.......actually, I can't really think of anything else that is actually different. So as you can see, I think this game was a bit of a let down, they basically got MoW AS and said ""I can't actaully be bothered to make a new game. We'll just chuck in a few extra maps and bring some back form the previous title"".			"

												If you have played Men of War assualt squad then this will be a very familure game. This is about the same as the first but with improved graphics and with better interface helpers (such as lines showing where your forces will move through). There are no new units in comparison to MoW:AS unless you use mods, but then, that is expected as no new units are being made from WW2 in this time and age. This is one of my favorate games on the market currently that has actual armor charactoristics and not just a ""point and shoot"" like company of heroes or other of that ilk. This game also allows you to manually controll one unit if you so wish (usually they are AI controlled the same as any RTS).With the many different weapons in your arsenal as well as tanks, halftracks 5tons and duce-n-a-halfs this game brings a fast as well as very realistic feel to World War instead of a cookie cutter cut and paste game where everyone is equal. You may not experiance the many small (or large) issues that the allies and axis had in WW2 with things breaking on tanks (from notmal use) but it is still a great game.			"

												It's a  cool game in theory. Being able to loot stuff of your enemies corpses? Hell yeah!Direct control? Sure it's a neat feature. Even though the camera is not really pleasant with it.But the way it's implemented? No thing as ""auto loot"" if you just slayed a lot of enemies and need bullets. You need to look through the corpses manually. Your medics drop their medpacks constantly and you need to micromanage pick it up again.Maps are limited, but those limits count only for the player. The AI will drive or run right out of there and shoot you from there, out of anti-tank grenade reach.Pathfinding is also a source of frustration. Anti-Tank guns running into wallsAlso, there are frequent crashes.			"

												This game brings the realistic tactical battlefield experience to players with updated graphics as compared to its predecessors like Sudden Strike and Blitzkreig series. One of the greatest things about this game is that the scale of battle is between COH series and wargame series; The unit count is bigger than COH which give the better feel of coordinating large armies while, being smaller than Wargame, the units are not too tiny or represented by NATO conventions most of the time. Do not be fooled by other reviewers saying the mission are a mundane tasks of assault and defense, the map design is different for each mission which brings the difference in experience. (urban assault, farmland stomp or heavily fortified HQ, etc)I feel the main focus of the game is on tank battles which are the most fun and memorable in WWII era games. The tanks details and mechanics are well modelled. There are things like modular damage (track and turret damage, crew injury), selectable ammunitions (HE, AP, etc) which bring the realism in these battles. If you like to play plastic green soldiers when you were a kid, this is highly recommended for you!			"

Product received for free
												I enjoyed this game so much for the time I have been playing as evident by the screen shots I have taken, the ability to control the units inventory and how they protect themselves along with facing and many other aspects over their control is very enjoyable. I recently started to try the modded maps and had found great interest in a few the best ones having screen shots. The game is worth buying alone and the additions just ad much more. Here is a example of a modded map I had a interesting time with. Mt Pretty v 1.2 by TjdaggerYou can find screen shots of it on my profile.Stage 1 ""Hard"" I been playing this for several days now on hard, I captured the first base and all the ground to the bridge. I then started to set up mortars and artillery to destroy their base artillery. At this point I was able to destroy two of the mid range ones. After that most of my equipment was target and hit with accuracy I could not achieve with anything I could use or buy. This cycle would repeat thanks to the heavy artillery. I first tried pushing with many units spread out with no prevail, then with a large group of the best tanks I could buy, with no prevail, then made the logical conclusion I needed to do full out assault. I built up my units with the addition now of snipers & medics.   I repaired tanks and added them to my growing tank unit and ordered new mid range Artillery then I did a full on assault. My units were killed off so I kept ordering more and healing the dead. Next I found my tanks getting destroyed and one of my artillery, I moved in more to replace them and the new units arrived, as they pushed up the hills it felt alike to D day as they were swiftly mowed down or blown away. My tanks became damaged and I worked hard to repair what I could but I soon ran out of tanks, the last set of units was spread far to divert the fire of the artillery which works for sometime, but I was unable to make any direct hits on anything with my artillery which became annoying which then they were swiftly hit in order by the heavy artillery. I even had that heavy artillery hit an ammo and it made a domino effect causing the fuel truck to explode the 4 mid range artillery to explode the machine gunner and units nearby to get hit by the explosion, and lastly the tank and other vehicles nearby. As said it was a domino effect so they were spread out with only a few linking each other and I was unsure to be impressed or give up.  This map is the first to give me such a tug of war and neither me nor the Nazis are gaining ground its just a pile of dead bodies and destroyed  vehicles with much blood and holes. You could walk over the water filled with the corpses and tanks. None of disappear for me most likely due to a mod and the carnage can be seen across the map and the game is at the point where the dead are finally now make the game lag it took some time and I can still play but it's clearly slowed. Even know it is fun to have such a challenge I don't think I will beat this anytime soon.Have fun playing this.			"

												Less than suitable performance for sub standard graphics in 2014 gives the impression of a poorly optimized game. The so called Skirmish mode is not skirmish in any traditional RTS sense, and does not allow you to jump into dynamic battles on various maps in a way you would expect, but rather plays out as a campaign. Nor does it feature any co-op vs AI. To make it worse, the game does next to nothing to explain, or teach, its game-play. The community around the game also leaves a lot to be desired, with members quick to jump at people who bring up an opinion on the game that does not match their own. A regretful purchase and not one I would recommend to friends (or enemies).			"

								I CANNOT UPVOTE THIS ENOUGH. I used to be a COH player through and through, then i became older than 13 and realised what a stupid and failed game that it really is. If you want to see men being cut down and tanks blown up by molotov cocktails the way that god intended it then this game is for you. Seriously. Once you play past the first couple of missions you will not want to return to company of zeroes ever again. I first started with the original Men Of War Assault Squad, this is better than that and with all of the content coming out I am sure that it will be the best in the Men Of Series to date.			"

												Game keeps chrashing because of an steam overlay bug? Really? How can that even sneak into the final build!? I do love the destructable buildings and the verhicle gameplay. But if steam messes with your product in such a way that I have turn off my steam overlay, which I've never had to do in my ten+ years on steam, just so the game doesn't crash. Well, then the good points kinda melt away.And lets not forget you have to BUY DLC to get access to bots in MP. Call to Arms will hopefully release in a better state due to a long EA phase, but as far as this game goes; Not recommended.			"

												WarningThe game is like Men of War: Assault Squad 1. OH wait no you need to buy DLC to make it that game. [A LOT of DLC]The reviewSingle playerGood a lot of fun, difficult and interesting campaigns and you can add more with the workshop. Might be worth buying the core game. Multiplayer [Disastrous] Reason being that you need to rank up to unlock new units aka you have few units to use to fight users that have all the units unlocked. Also to rank up you need to win [see the issue?] because of this you never rank up and you lose all the time unless you find a game with someone who is the same level as you [they probably already gave up on the game though]. However even if you find one of these games there is a bug in the game that will never go away. This bug is a game killer that strikes at almost random times and will just crash the game.  "

Early Access Review
								Firstly i own all the men of wars, Vietnam and CH were horrible games, why?, because they were developed by 1C not Digitalmindsoft, Digitalmindsoft made the first MOWAS.This is going to be a great sequal, i really like the idea that the game uses steam instead of gamespy. and ofc Steam workshop, its going to be amazing to see all the mods that will come from the workshop. Yes its much like the first MOWAS in terms of units. BUT its in BETA so not everything is in the game, But there are a lot of new engine improvements that makes the game look amazing in terms of graphics, i have not experience any lag like the first men of war had, there are a few new game modes like day of victory in which you capture the flag that is located in the middle, extreme assault zones which is just a bigger assault zones. I hear a lot of people complaning that its the same game, well in terms of units there isnt a lot you can add that was in world war 2, it isnt like call of duty were you can add a few more weapons, this game is based on world war 2, i do wish they could add everything from the German soldiers mod to MOWAS 2 because that had a lot of great units, and its only 21€ its not a 59.99€ release. if you arent sure that you like what you see right now, then dont buy it, wait until its complete, and remember its in beta a lot of things can still change.

								This is early access review.In terms of the looks the game is not really that much different. Most of the animations, units etc look like in the first one and the feel of the game is the same.There are some major improvements in the play already though and heres some of them. (Will keep adding info as more content comes availevable)1)Improved pathfinding. Doesnt sound like much does it? It is actually a really big difference the units infantry and vehicles alike no longer get stuck as easy and the game shows the path they will take so if you can correct the route so no longer running through that open area infront of the machine gun or straight to the minefield.2)More maps. Again not something major but for me who has played all maps 50 times seeing new maps (and theyre actually new not just old copies from the original men of war) and what Ive tried so far theyre nice as well. Hoping to see more variety on the bigger 6v6 and 8v8 maps.3)No gamespy. Yeah no longer must we suffer from gamespy forgetting our cd keys etc.....More to come....			"

Early Access Review
								If you havent played any of the Men of War games, and I would only really recommend Men of War, Men of War Assault Squad and to some extent Men of War Red Tide. Then do so now! Men of War is the successor to Soldiers Heroes of WW2 and Faces of War. In many respects the game remained unchanged for many years and then DMS took the reigns with the Assault Squad frnachise. Assault Squad largely focusses on MP and whilst there are Single Player skirmish, these again are recommended to be played in Co Op. There is no SP campaign like the MoW or Red Tide games.So what about Assault Squad 2? Its in beta atm and so there are performance issues and bugs as to be expected. The major ground work on AS2 is the engine improvements, graphic updates, new models for many vehicles and tanks and lots of new MP maps and SP missions/skirmish.The gameplay is largely the same as AS. The UI has more detailed information now. The UI does look a little bit cluttered for my liking but I am sure a mod will simplify this and it is still in beta so may change for release. AS2, no more Gamespy! yea! Easier installation and file sharing of mods. In game voice chat. Better options in MP. Having played the beta the SP Skirmish is similar to AS, but there arent waves of enemy attacks. It feels more structured and you get extra resources dependent on your actions. In all the SP side and Co OP looks promising and is a bit more creative than the skirmishes in AS. MP the new maps look and play well. Performance is impacting MP atm, but patches are being released every few days. Overall not a huge amount different to AS, although the improvements to the engine have upgraded to Multi Core CPU support and therefore the graphics are really looking top notch. The tank models are outstanding. New MP and SP maps should keep us MoW players happy for some time. The new UI gives more information including unit kills per unit. A complex game which just keeps getting better and better. If you compare AS2 to MoW MP the difference is huge. I wouldnt go back, however the SP portion of MoW is more captivating. "

								It's basically an engine rewrite (multicore, new graphics) of the first MoW:AS, with shiny new models, 2 new(ish) tanks, and new missions made by a great community modder DJSatane (Much love, much respect). I've heard of some gameplay changes but I haven't noticed them.He says DLC support will be greater, and hopefully the final game will be more stable (it crashes extremely often now). Hopefully older content will be easily ported to this.I'd get it only if you're a hardcore MoW fan, otherwise wait until after release. Still, Assault Squad was probably the best multiplayer experience in the series and an improved version of it is probably worth getting in my book (provided stability issues are solved)			"

												Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is everything Assault Squad 1 was, but improved. More mission, a tutorial for each nation, and  Steam mod support makes the game easily customisable. Men of War: AS2 is a game of your own experience. There are no heroes to follow, no stories to be told. Unless you say otherwise. You can watch as your US Paratroopers land, commanded by Alan Smith or whoever make there way to a German MG post that's been slaughtering elements of your frontal unit. You create the story in the mission of your choice. Plus, everything is usable. Every individual soldier has ammo, a gun and a helmet, alongside maybe a fieldworks or repair kit, and all these can be taken. You have no more ammo for your rifle? ""Soldier, grab some SMG ammo and that MP 40 from Jerry"". Require a tank, but can't afford it? ""Jackson, see that panzer? Repair it and get it back here"". Every single firearm, every mortar, every AT and howitzer gun, every armoured fighting vehicle, is capable of spewing death upon it's previous masters. Provided you keep them stocked with fuel, ammo, and keeping them intact, of course. Another addition to the game is the veterency system. Individual soldiers, once they kill someone, will gain some veterency, and gain better stats, more HP, more stamina, better weapon handling, better tank control, everything. If you're a sucker for WW2 RTS games, then I'd recommend this one. There might be a lot to learn, but it's all compressed neatly onto the screen, while also allowing you to seen what's happening. And soldier, don't expect everyone under your command to make it out of there alive. War is hell. "

												This is the most frustrating game I have ever played, but somehow I keep coming back for more. I love playing RTS games, and this one is on top of my list.  Every unit is important during the game play.  Each one gets their own inventory, with access other units as well.  While they start with limited ammo, you can search the dead for more.Like any game, it has it's down falls.  The biggest peeve I have is with enemy units being able to see mine across the map, while I can't see them.  The more I play this, the more the AI for each unit seems to get dumber.  I had one unit run circles around an enemy as I clicked for it to attack, literally doing circles like a dog around your legs.  It has a lot of little things that make you scream at the game because it's so frustrating.  But it's so addicting, I keep going back for more.Micro managing is crucial with this game, making it very difficult to master.  The enemy AI (Easy, Normal, Hard, Heroic) are all challenging, almost impossible to play without other friends.  Which is one amazing aspect because you can play every mission with up to 7 other players LAN or internet.  Don't expect to beat a good mission in a short amount of time this game takes lots of time.I don't like the personal leveling for this game.  You have to beat an entire mission to get an exp., this counts for first person controlling of a unit as well.  There could be an actual storyline for each campaign, not just the same ten missions for each country.Every unit is extraordinary. The detail, the movements, even the gunfire immerses you.  The sounds and feels of the game are amazing.This game still has quite a few bugs, as I cannot load a saved game right from the main menu.  I once had an invincible enemy unit enter the field, an every unit I had could not take it out. So I had to restart the mission, very frustrating since it was the largest tank at the end of the mission.  Also many times main mission objectives don't activate, making you restart the mission.THE UNIT AI IS HORRENDOUS!! They are always standing up by themselves, which in turn is a death sentence in this game.  Medics do not do anything but create another target for the enemy, same with units that have AT grenades/ rockets. I wish there was tutorial missions to get you into the flow of the combat, that way you can use every aspect of the game.I've downloaded some mods, and they bring this game to a whole new level.  The talent some of these people have makes you think they work for the developers.			"

												This is a very good strategy game. It is far better than Company of Heroes 2 in every way: realism, depth, unit selection... the list goes on.However, it has a fatal flaw: It crashes.It crashes when you get a Steam notification.It crashes when there's an explosion that's too big.It crashes when you alt-tab.It crashes when you invite a friend.It crashes sometimes when you press the Multiplayer button.It crashes sometimes on the multiplayer loading screen, even when finished loading.It crashes ON THE F#CK|NG TITLE SCREEN if you leave it alone for too long.""Debugging"" was not in the developer's vocabulary.(Please note that this is NOT due to a lack of RAM or hard drive space, I have 8GB RAM and over 100GB of free disk space, and the game never uses more than a few GB of RAM.)

												For a truly fantastic revitalisation of an already amazing game, assault squad 2 has the perfect blend of realism and that little amount of 'physics wtf' to make it truly special. For those new to the Genre Men Of War is basically an amazing WW2 RTS which has the capabilities to allow one to alter their unit's inventory, as well as take direct control of that always satisfying Katyusha. Whilst Assault squad 2 bears many similarities to assault squad one, there are a few mission differences (although all different maps are still 'unique' in their own special way) meaning one can never truly be bored playing this game.Though the major benefits of owning AS2 rather than regular AS are many:+Decent community modding.+Multiplayer is still up and not running on gamespy: P+New units (I’m sure)+A pleasant variety of maps which surpasses its predecessorOverall a very decent game with good visuals, lovely soundtrack and an amusing amount of medics needed to keep ones army from being ripped to shred... Damn those American machine guns!10/10			"

												This game like all the other Men of War games is a complete master piece!This game isnt to much of a change from Men of War: Assault Squad 1, but there are some small things that make it that much better. 1: Graphics are a bit better and some bug fixes (some)2: Better units. Example: In the mission Overlord for the americans, when calling in paratroopers a squad of 5 parachutes in, instead of just one trooper, this is a major fix in my mind, logically you would send 1 trooper in at a time and sending in squads would be a more ""rational"" amount. 3: MAJOR FIX: mulitplayer is fixed and you can play online, unlike the other Men of War: Assault Squad that ran off of game spy (an unused and discontinued gaming network). This makes the game so much better, multiplayer, for players who has friends that don't own the game, or those who don't have friends (if you don't have any, make some!)4: This isn't a fix but makes the game so much more fun, Steam Workshop, custom maps easier to get and mods the same! There are some great maps and mods on the workshop and i recommend anyone that has to check it out!This game get a 10/10 for the beautiful and never ending fun that the game gives!			"

												            A year ago I was introduced to CNC Red Alert 2 I could not get enough of it. Constant playing all day never wanting to stop. Then I bought CNC 3 Tiberium wars  (through Origin) I thought that that game was the best there ever would be.             Then about 6 months later I was looking around steam and saw Men of War AS2. At first i thought it looked okay and no other thought. Then I looked deeper and wanted to get that game. I thought it would be 19.99 (being used to geting 9.99 games on steam) but then I saw it 29.99! I almost swore at it but someone was in the room with me.              2 months later I got enough cash to get the gameso I bought it. IT WAS AMAZING!! I was discouraged by the bad reviews at first but they, to me, seemed to lie as i played the game.PROS+Great Cover system for your units+Names for all your units (I do occassionally just call one billy)+Direct control! You wanna be a tank? Then be one!+Balanced gameplay+Motion changer+See through the house roofCons-Omaha! Normandy! C'mon! D-Day is one of my favorite battles!

												One of THE best rts stratergies out there. If you like the Company of Heroes franchise or the Wargame series then this game is for you. The developeres of this game keep creating better and better games. The only downside is that they have gotten rid of (or not implemented) the ability to pick up weapons off the ground. The micromanagment aspect of the game goes down to the level of ammo managment as per usual for the franchise. They have used a trie and tested formula with new units and a new campaign. I cannot recomend this game enough.			"

												Scratches the itch that Blitzkrieg II failed to cure. A great in-depth strategic RTS that also allows for smalls scale tactical gameplay in squad based and even room to room combat. Seemingly finally getting a handle on the 3D graphical settings that typically held back earlier RTS games. Great detail, diversity and fun features like controlling individual units. Great game, would recommend with no hessitation.			"

												This is the most frustrating game I have ever played, but somehow I keep coming back for more. I love playing RTS games, and this one is on top of my list.  Every unit is important during the game play.  Each one gets their own inventory, with access other units as well.  While they start with limited ammo, you can search the dead for more.Like any game, it has it's down falls.  The biggest peeve I have is with enemy units being able to see mine across the map, while I can't see them.  The more I play this, the more the AI for each unit seems to get dumber.  I had one unit run circles around an enemy as I clicked for it to attack, literally doing circles like a dog around your legs.  It has a lot of little things that make you scream at the game because it's so frustrating.  But it's so addicting, I keep going back for more.Micro managing is crucial with this game, making it very difficult to master.  The enemy AI (Easy, Normal, Hard, Heroic) are all challenging, almost impossible to play without other friends.  Which is one amazing aspect because you can play every mission with up to 7 other players LAN or internet.  Don't expect to beat a good mission in a short amount of time this game takes lots of time.I don't like the personal leveling for this game.  You have to beat an entire mission to get an exp., this counts for first person controlling of a unit as well.  There could be an actual storyline for each campaign, not just the same ten missions for each country.Every unit is extraordinary. The detail, the movements, even the gunfire immerses you.  The sounds and feels of the game are amazing.This game still has quite a few bugs, as I cannot load a saved game right from the main menu.  I once had an invincible enemy unit enter the field, an every unit I had could not take it out. So I had to restart the mission, very frustrating since it was the largest tank at the end of the mission.  Also many times main mission objectives don't activate, making you restart the mission.THE UNIT AI IS HORRENDOUS!! They are always standing up by themselves, which in turn is a death sentence in this game.  Medics do not do anything but create another target for the enemy, same with units that have AT grenades/ rockets. I wish there was tutorial missions to get you into the flow of the combat, that way you can use every aspect of the game.I've downloaded some mods, and they bring this game to a whole new level.  The talent some of these people have makes you think they work for the developers.			"

												I love this game would be an understatement, especially once you add the Sir Henkle mod.A hardcore RTS where every soldier has his own inventory, and tough but fair combat on hard mode.The only this that bothers me is when you play online and you order a squad then your friend gets half the forces when he has less, which don't get me wrong kinda makes sense, but when I order a unit I need it in full squad not just 1/4th of the squad. It's fixable by having your friend gift the units back to you but it should be an option not enforced by default.At the time of writing this I have played 101.8 hours and loved every second of it.

												For a truly fantastic revitalisation of an already amazing game, assault squad 2 has the perfect blend of realism and that little amount of 'physics wtf' to make it truly special. For those new to the Genre Men Of War is basically an amazing WW2 RTS which has the capabilities to allow one to alter their unit's inventory, as well as take direct control of that always satisfying Katyusha. Whilst Assault squad 2 bears many similarities to assault squad one, there are a few mission differences (although all different maps are still 'unique' in their own special way) meaning one can never truly be bored playing this game.Though the major benefits of owning AS2 rather than regular AS are many:+Decent community modding.+Multiplayer is still up and not running on gamespy: P+New units (I’m sure)+A pleasant variety of maps which surpasses its predecessorOverall a very decent game with good visuals, lovely soundtrack and an amusing amount of medics needed to keep ones army from being ripped to shred... Damn those American machine guns!10/10			"

												First time loading it up i was blown away by how you can control a group of infantry to just controlling a single person. and to really injoy this game you need to have good stratery to win a battle. this game goes into my top 5 World War 2 games along with Brothers in Arms Hells Highway and many more and not to mention you can manually control your men or Vehicles really impressed by that. But i wish they had more plane action or better controls to flying the aircraft or you could call in a bomber to bomb a target.

Win the war!(but you can call in reinforcements if you want)Watch out for OP German tanks and random hits from AT cannons. (also AT+AA cannons are much more deadly to infantry than HMGs.. pffffft)But you can always just take control of your little soldier and go take down that guy in the MG nest that you can't shoot. And you may have to do it quite often.And don't forget! Always make sure that the German tank is dead and not just disabled. ALWAYS. They wait for the perfect chance to strike and destroy your expensive 1000 MP tank you just called in. Whoops!TL:DRIt has less bugs than AS1 and better UI. Buy it.			"

												WARNING do not buy this piece of crap game, the developers couldnt even release it without hustling money from loyal players. The day it was to be released they changed it to an early acces game, no chance for players to get money refunded, they did that on purporse. The game lost almost all veteran players and thus completely changed the way the game was played, the new playerbase comes from COH and these players try to play the game like it was COH. 40 patches on and the game is still buggy, imagine you buy a pair of jeans and they have to be patched more than 40 times and they are still full of holes. The engine for MOWAS1 worked alot better, MOWAS2 is actually a downgrade of the first game, in this version you cant even play big maps, biggest map is 4vs4 pl and the new maps are unbalanced, one side can reach zones before the other, so in MOWAS2 you play on the same old small maps as you did in MOWAS1. The developers do not listen to any critisism at all, you get sencored or banned, Digitalmindsoft resembles a company out of north Korea or the old DDR. This game has been on sale many many times because Digitalmindsoft do not have the funds to fix/finish the game, they want us the players to fund it as they develop it and the constant sales ruins the game. because everytime there is a sale, new players come and have to learn the game and they do not listen, they just do as they please and the learningcurve is steep, very very hard to get a good game with all the veterans gone and only new players that do not know how to play the game. By the way take a look at this game and you will see that it is outdated, looks and feels like a 15 year old RTS. DO NOT support this hustler company called Digitalmindsoft.			"

												I loved the original ""Men of War"" game and played it for hundreds of hours. The only reason I even play this is because the multiplayer doesn't work anymore. The single player in this is a joke, any title in the series that does not have ""Assault Squad"" in the name is actually enjoyable in single player. Multiplayer suffered as well. The only maps in this game that are not absolutely terrible are ones that were in ""Men of War"". Most of the maps made for Assault Squad and Assault Squad 2 are horribly designed. Most of the new maps reward ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay such as boring, symmetrical maps that offer little in the way of tactical planning (since they are exactly the same for both teams) and maps where the first one to reach a certain point almost always wins. Examples of this include buildings placed on one side of a capture zone, giving one player an almost perfect way to protect their men, while the other player has to stand completely exposed.Artillery in this is stupid. They heavily nerfed artillery's ability to target important enemy positions because of the stupid ""bombardment"" feature where they fire a few shots in a short time with a long reload time instead of single shots. This ""bombardment"" feature makes the artillery pieces that use it quite bad because they waste ammo and the enemy can easily move their men to avoid the shots after the first and they can easily destroy it since your artillery is locked into firing the entire barrage, preventing you from relocating it. The accuracy of artillery was decreased as well. This nerf to artillery means that tanks and tank destroyers play much too big a role in the game. The exception to this is rocket artillery, which has been buffed so much that it can reliably destroy tanks, meaning that USA is overpowered (they have a tank with a rocket launcher on top that not only fires more rockets than any other unit, but is mounted on a tank making it hard to destroy from long range unlike other rockets and allowing it to quickly move back to safety after firing).Something about the game also allows players to act like complete idiots and somehow succeed sometimes. Time and time again I have seen players simply flood a capture point with men and hide them in a building or behind some cover and it actually works. Tactics like this are absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in a game that is supposed to be about realism. Even with a handful of men, you should be able to kill plenty of enemies if they are just running in the open, but they always reach cover and shoot all of your men. Artillery being nerfed means that if the enemy puts a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of men behind a building, you have almost no way of killing them except for sending a tank right to the frontline (which is a stupid idea). To try something as ridiculous as that in Men of War would result in all of the men running in the open to be killed very quickly.Overall, the game feels arcadey and unbalanced. None of the problems from the original game were fixed and none of the new features added make the game more enjoyable. If you want to play single player, just buy ""Men of War"" instead of this game. If you only want to play multiplayer with friends, buy ""Men of War"" and play multiplayer using GameRanger. This game completely misses the whole point of the Men of War series and tries to be some sort of ""competitive multiplayer"" game. I would not recommend buying this game unless you really want to play multiplayer with strangers. Even then, do not buy it unless there is a really good sale.			"

												This game is absolute.... Awesomeness, but. Some things aren't so good. :PAs an example, the Graphics are worse then Assault Squad 1 and I barely play that game, the voices and weapon system in this game is aswell, garbage. The tank and vehicle's are lacking realism and there are so many vehicles and tanks of WW2 which aren't in this game. :LAswell as the people and AI in this game, for an example, a guy is holding a rifle, the rifle is floating in the air with the hands inside of the rifle. And the AI in this game is worse than Call to Arms, sometimes the AI just looks you in the face and tries to stab you from 400ft away.And the Editor might be good but how hard it is to actually spawn hostile vehicles.All in all, I barely reccomend this game. Even though I have 1000 hours on it!			"

												The devs of this company have taken RTS to a whole new level with it's franchise ""Men of War"". It lets you control individual units in a squad and also make them run around anywhere around the map.Pros:-Decent graphics (I recommend the terminator mod to make the game look better)-Many units to choose from-Soldiers can pick up grenades or pick up fallen weapons-You can make a soldier loot a dead body for ammo-Realistic tank damage (hull damage, tracks hit, ammunition rack on fire, etc)-Fun multiplayer if you play with friends-Workshop is full of maps, missions and mods to further improve your gameplay-Theres a editor where you can create your own maps, missions and battlesCons:-AI is ♥♥♥♥ especially close quarters infantry combat-Pointless DLCs with units that should be in the gameGrab this game at sale when it's around 5$ or pay full price which is around 20$			"

												MOWAS2 is tons of fun and i'd really recommend it if you're into this type of game and ww2. Basically you control units under your command to invade and capture the enemy's territory. It's exciting and really makes you think before you make a move. You have to pay attention to where the enemy is located, where they're going to be attacking you from, and what weapons you're going to need. Multiplayer is pretty awesome too. I love 2v2 because of the teamwork. For example, If you have a lonely AT cannon and need some more defense your teammate will send you a heavy MG to fight alongside.If you get bored of the same old units then you can also try installing a couple of mods that are to your liking. Some of these mods can be used in multiplayer and in the editor. I use the editor to have my own battles using Galaxy at War clone units.			"

												This was a total nostalgia trip for me as it is just like an indirect sequel to Soldiers: Heroes of World War 2 (one of the most memorable games I've played as a kid). It's so amazing how much it has improved in terms of AI and graphics in the game. (Even though the AI is still flawed). Sucks that I didn't watch it grow with the previous games over the years... :(I really like the workshop support for this game as gamers like us can put in and share our own missions, mods in the game (and there a really some talented ones at that). The 'direct control' function in the game sure is unique and really helpful in some situations, although I hear some people complaining about the 3rd person missions DLC. Hey, what's wrong with devs trying new things? The game isn't that strong storywise and all the factions have practically the same missions but on different maps, so singleplayer is pretty bland overall. However, being able to play them cooperatively with a buddy pretty much makes up for it. Haven't really tried multiplayer yet and I'll give it a go someday. Till then, co-op for days!Will recommend this game for WWII lovers as well as RTS lovers. It's really unique in my opinion. Give it a go!9/10 will get my Tiger detracked again			"

												Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is everything Assault Squad 1 was, but improved. More mission, a tutorial for each nation, and  Steam mod support makes the game easily customisable. Men of War: AS2 is a game of your own experience. There are no heroes to follow, no stories to be told. Unless you say otherwise. You can watch as your US Paratroopers land, commanded by Alan Smith or whoever make there way to a German MG post that's been slaughtering elements of your frontal unit. You create the story in the mission of your choice. Plus, everything is usable. Every individual soldier has ammo, a gun and a helmet, alongside maybe a fieldworks or repair kit, and all these can be taken. You have no more ammo for your rifle? ""Soldier, grab some SMG ammo and that MP 40 from Jerry"". Require a tank, but can't afford it? ""Jackson, see that panzer? Repair it and get it back here"". Every single firearm, every mortar, every AT and howitzer gun, every armoured fighting vehicle, is capable of spewing death upon it's previous masters. Provided you keep them stocked with fuel, ammo, and keeping them intact, of course. Another addition to the game is the veterency system. Individual soldiers, once they kill someone, will gain some veterency, and gain better stats, more HP, more stamina, better weapon handling, better tank control, everything. If you're a sucker for WW2 RTS games, then I'd recommend this one. There might be a lot to learn, but it's all compressed neatly onto the screen, while also allowing you to seen what's happening. And soldier, don't expect everyone under your command to make it out of there alive. War is hell. "

												Played this for the free weekend. A World War 2 taking command of whatever faction fits your fancy. ( USA, Japan, Germany, Common wealth or Soviet). In controll of the army using what units be it, infantry or tanks, you replay the factions famous battle from the war and using whatever means nessasary to win the war or battle. A stratagy game by using the right equipment and tactics for your units, their is some thinking involved in this game. A lot of equip options and units it takes a while to get up to speed of what does what and where, when and etc. etc. The main solo mode is called skirmish and each faction has 9 missions that rely on you mastering your units and skills. All the missions are around the same for each faction. There is a multiplayer option, but I was not able to try this part of the game. I can see where this game could be fun and challanging especailly against real people, not AI's. But the game had some cons.  Their is no tuturial or learn to play mode and this hit me as a bummer, because me for one, love to know what is going on before I jump in. ( I guess that is why the acheivment for first mission is called baptism of fire). There is though a tuturial video(s) that you can play to learn somewhat of what is going on, but no hands on learning. Also the games graphics are very good and the destrucation by artillery and tanks and such is really good. Snow, like in real life fighting I imagine is annoying. The enviroment also does provide cover for you and the enemy and if your not looking just right, you can be snuck up on.  A good game if your a WWII fan and like stratagy games like DoW. There seems to be lots of DLC you can by new skirmishes and skins it looks like. But after the short 9 missions for whatever faction you choose. I would move on to another game unless beating children and making them cry in multiplayer is your thing.			"

												10/10 One of the best RTS games I've ever played, up there with battles in Rome Total War. Although this game requires a learning curve, once you learn it, it can be a hell of a lot of fun. The amount of units give you a wide variety of ways to deal with the enemy, this goes for both the campaign and the multiplayer. However this game does have its bugs and glitches and does require pretty good internet and decent PC/Laptop to run, the awesome clutch moments and hilarious moments you can have completely outwiegh all of that. The mods are alos really good, making realism even better although a little bit harder, I suggest you rack up a few hours of the vanilla game before taking mods on because they really change gameplay. If you love the World War 2 time period and love RTS games, this should be your dream to play, however if you play War Thunder, a few things are different so keep that in mind. Little side note before I stop, the game has  a LOT OF EXPLOSIONS, LIKE A SH*T TON. THERE ARE EXPLOSIONS THAT MAKE VEHICLES DO 360 SPINS 100 FEET IN THE AIR, IT IS F*CKING AWESOME! BUY THIS GAME!

You will still rank up ;)I would rate the game 7 of 10Gfx, music and sfx is awesome.  The maps ingame just looks awesome. Almost everything can be blown away.

												I am pretty new to the RTS scene and I was kind of overwhelmed with the controls at first, but it has a guide section that shows evrything needed to know if you are a new comer like myself, which makes learning pretty simple and straight forward, so no worries. It is kind of buggy and crashes at times for me, but in all it is a fun game to play and I enjoy playing it with friends. It has Co-op and PVP, plus it has plenty of mods to choose from.

												I love this game, I really ♥♥♥♥ing do.But Jesus.♥♥♥♥ing.Christ.This AI is some of the worst I've seen in a long ♥♥♥♥ing time. Apparently my infantry, as trained as any other, will get murdered will spread out, shifting the suppression so it has to cover multiple people, DOESN'T WORK for some reason. Boy, I'm glad somebody can stack a bunch of units that are getting shot at by a tank still fire back 5x more than my infantry that is just going against a squad of infantry that's bunched up while they're spread out. Seems pretty cool. Snap shot shooting is even WORSE, I haven't seen my AI do it yet, but I've seen one snipe one my units over a ♥♥♥♥ing river, through some grass just to kill him in time before he finally (after three years) starts to throguh a frag grenade. I've also seen tanks that normally can't penetrate any part of a tank not give a ♥♥♥♥ and still kill it somehow (this is all frontal, the turrent had enough armor as well to repel it) . My infantry by the way in the SAME GAME(S) THAT IT HAPPENED IN, COULDN'T kill people out in the open. Looks like my well trained German soldiers with Kar 98s, an MG42 and some MP40s are actually ♥♥♥♥ing monkeys. However, when the sandbags somehow ♥♥♥♥ing finished all my infantry got ♥♥♥♥ing demolished when they were in cover. The game is underful, but the AI in PvP is ♥♥♥♥ing KILLING ME, I haven't seen much of a problem with Skirmish AI but as SOON AS I SWITCH TO PVP Hooollllyyy shiiittt. From what I can see I would recommend this game, but, you may notice some of the AI problems like I have. I like this game I really do, but, I don't like being punched in the face for trying to play against other people. If you can get by these annoyances this game is actually really amazing.			"

 TL;DR If you're into WW2 RTS games, Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is probably worth full price. Plenty of content, a fairly active multiplayer scene, an abundance of mods, and rock-solid mechanics. There are some issues - mainly engine and online stability issues - but they don't necessarily ruin the game. DLC isn't spectacular, but Airborne is worth the buy. MOW:AS2 is definitely worth the price, especially if it is on sale. Graphics & Sound Functional. Not much to write home about but the game looks pretty and it doesn't eat your framerate. Sounds aren't terribly impressive but they work well enough. Voice acting is iffy, with a lot of it being recycled from previous MOW games. Core Gameplay Incredibly fun. MOW:AS2 adds a lot of nice additions to Men of War's already awesome gameplay. Although it can be micro-heavy, infantry combat is enjoyable and the inventory system gives the players much more freedom than similar WW2 RTS games. Vehicle combat is also a lot of fun, thanks to the ability to directly control your vehicles. AS2 also adds plenty of helpful UI elements and mechanics that just build on the classic MOW gameplay. Single-Player Not brilliant, but not bad. There isn't a campaign to speak of - just a large number of individual skirmish missions. They all tend to be very similar as well, which can be problematic if you get bored by samey missions. Despite the similarities, the skirmishes themselves can be pretty enjoyable, especially the defensive skirmish missions. However, stealth missions are flat-out terrible, in my opinion, because of the game's AI. Skip them. Multi-Player Pretty good. Balance-wise, the game isn't brilliant. At least, it doesn't beat Company of Heroes in terms of balance. Still, Germany vs. USA games and Soviet vs. Germany games are well balanced, and thus quite popular online. However, the matches themselves are a lot less predictable, since there is high capacity for shenanigans thanks to the gameplay mechanics. This can be good or bad, depending on your play style. Still, the competitive multiplayer is enjoyable. Also worth noting is the ability to play the single-player skirmish missions cooperatively. If you have a friend or two that like WW2 RTS, playing the coop skirmish missions on a higher difficulty can make for a really good time. You can also play modded skirmish missions cooperatively, so there is actually a wide array of coop content.As of me writing this review, the game's online has a number of stability issues, primarily the ""Out of Sync"" issue, which can disconnect a player and ruin the flow of the game. The devs have said that they are working on it, but it should be mentioned, especially since it is a fairly common problem. Modding Men of War games have had good modding scenes for quite some time. AS2 is no exception. In fact, I would say it has one of the best modding scenes out of the entire franchise. There's a lot of total conversion mods that can completely change the game, adding a lot of replayability. There are also tons of custom skirmish missions and multiplayer maps. The modding scene is active and adds a lot to the game. DLC The DLC for this game is not particularly great. For starters, the Deluxe Edition is a complete ripoff. The XP boost is pointless, since a lot of servers play with unlocked units, and unless you REALLY want that fancy nametag, the Deluxe Edition is not worth the $7. ($5 when bought with the game.) Iron fist isn't great either. It adds some War Thunder-style tank missions that give you direct control of a veteran tank. Problem is, you can directly control your tanks in the vanilla game, minus the fancy camera angles and the mission flavor. Not worth $10 - get it on sale if you want it.The best DLC out of all of them has to be Airborne, which adds five very enjoyable skirmish missions. The missions are focused on infantry combat and defense. They also give the option of skipping the stealth section, and the maps are quite unique. It is debatable whether or not the multiplayer bots should have been added into the game for free, but the DLC is already out. To be honest, the bot AI is actually a bit disappointing, especially when it comes to vehicles. Still, the bots might make Airborne worth full price. Depends on your standards.Overall, Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is a good game. It is an essential for anyone who enjoys WW2 RTS games and I can honestly recommend it. The price is reasonable, especially when you consider the active modding scene and the solid multiplayer.			"

Early Access Review
								I used to play Company of Heroes 1 and 2. I used to enjoy doing so. But then one day I discovered Men of War Assault squad. A game that balances realism and gameplay. Infantry out in the open will die in two seconds under mg fire. Flamethrowers kill whoever they shoot at. Flanking, retreating, feinting. This game is far more tactical and strategic than Company of heroes can ever hope to be. Armored battles are both thrilling and nerve racking. A single shell in the right place can end a one on one armor battle. Medium tanks have the same armor stats as their in real life counterparts. Medium tanks will bounce almost every shell off their strong upper glacis armor, but lower glacis is weak like irl. Its outstanding. I am in love with this series and hope to see its player base grow. I am sad that games with far more limited mechanics than this are seen as outstanding, I used to be such a person my self. Please try this game. It is so beautiful. Gameplay over graphics.			"

Early Access Review
								This strong ww2 based RTS comes from a company trusted for wanting historical accuracy, and establishing realisitic games to an excellent extent (IL-2: Sturmovik line). Accurate models of tanks and the capabilities of their weapons and armour sketch the outline of this game, with solid infantry combat at its core. One of the key features of the game series is the ability to directly control a unit. Keeping your top overview, you can thusly control an infantryman or tank using the wasd-keys and mouse to give you the edge of the standard unit ai. Whether you use it to take out a tank's track before finishing it off, or to grab a grenade and whipe out a clutch of infantry, the result is usually critical in a match. Another feature is that vehicles and heavy weapons (AT-guns, MGs) which are critically damaged and abandoned can be recrewed, repaired and added to your army. Maybe not unique in the RTS world, it is done excellently in this game.Veterans of the original Assault Squad will mainly see graphical and engine improvements and a few new units and maps wrapped in a fresh package at a low price as far as new games go. Do not, however, expect a brand new game, which it has never claimed to be.  "

Early Access Review
								As a veteran of 450+ hours on Men of War: Assault Squad and a closed beta tester of this game, I feel inclined to give a review. Men of War Assault Squad 2 is a both a step forward that just has a little way to go before it is a success. It features some fantastic new features, namely the UI, steam support, and graphical enhancements. New missions give the single player more life than the challenging, yet monotonous skirmishes of its predecessor. The new vehicle textures are spectacular, including unique camoflage based on environment. Although the infantry textures are somewhat outdated, they don't detract from the game, same with the foliage and shaders. Once again, a relatively steep learning curve is displayed, requiring refined skills that can only be achieved through dedicated online play. You CANNOT just jump in and expect to win like other RTS games. You have to be patient and learn from your mistakes. Furthermore, you must dedicate yourself to learning the wider variety of control features the game displays, including the glorious direct control mode that allows for the most epic tank maneuvers you'll experience within the genre, the intuitive unit equiping system that allows you to loot and recover lost weapons and ammo, and finally the vehicle damage/penetration/component damage system, repairing vehicles based on where they were hit. Each of these features are what seperate the Men of War games from the rest of the genre, and mastering them is the key to success in multiplayer and getting over that curve. The only qualm I have so far with the game is the multiplayer connection glitches. 1 in every 2 games I have played so far have poor framerates, disconnects, or straight up crashes. This makes multiplayer somewhat unplayable for me right now, whereas Assault Squad 1 had very few online issues. I'm confident, however, that the developers will have the multiplayer optimized by the full release, and as I understand, very few other players have had these issues. Overall, I definatly reccommend this game to both veterans of the series and new players who want a massive tactical challenge. So long as you don't give up, this series can become one of the most rewarding and intuitive experiences you'll ever find. PS: To those who would compare this to Company of Heroes, they are different on fundamental levels. COH is an arcade style fast paced base builder with nowhere near as much thought to detail and realism on the level that MOW displays, but is a very fun game for what it is. Don't compare them, just enjoy them both based on what you find to be most satifying.			"

												It's quite the same game as the prequel but is a extremely solid game worth to buy if you're into WW2 strategy games and don't own the prequel. DLC's aren't that special but if you're interested in them just buy the complete edition at once.			"

								I used to play Company of Heroes 1 and 2. I used to enjoy doing so. But then one day I discovered Men of War Assault squad. A game that balances realism and gameplay. Infantry out in the open will die in two seconds under mg fire. Flamethrowers kill whoever they shoot at. Flanking, retreating, feinting. This game is far more tactical and strategic than Company of heroes can ever hope to be. Armored battles are both thrilling and nerve racking. A single shell in the right place can end a one on one armor battle. Medium tanks have the same armor stats as their in real life counterparts. Medium tanks will bounce almost every shell off their strong upper glacis armor, but lower glacis is weak like irl. Its outstanding. I am in love with this series and hope to see its player base grow. I am sad that games with far more limited mechanics than this are seen as outstanding, I used to be such a person my self. Please try this game. It is so beautiful. Gameplay over graphics.			"

												Men of War Assault Squad 1.5 is what the game should be called. The biggest difference is new vehicles and new maps. The new engine does very little mostly prettier textures but same old bad performance. Several maps is reuset instead of usa is attacking, it's germany now. There are two different kinds of missions attack and take over flags and protect a flag. The harder the difficulty  more enemies is indefinitely respawnd it starts to get a little too excessively about 50 tanks and hundreds of soldiers at the same time and you only have about 5 tanks and a couple of squads of men and it can be up to 40 minutes before the time runs out and you win on def missions. If you have assualt squad 1 dont buy it or wait for a sale not more the 9.99			"

								This strong ww2 based RTS comes from a company trusted for wanting historical accuracy, and establishing realisitic games to an excellent extent (IL-2: Sturmovik line). Accurate models of tanks and the capabilities of their weapons and armour sketch the outline of this game, with solid infantry combat at its core. One of the key features of the game series is the ability to directly control a unit. Keeping your top overview, you can thusly control an infantryman or tank using the wasd-keys and mouse to give you the edge of the standard unit ai. Whether you use it to take out a tank's track before finishing it off, or to grab a grenade and whipe out a clutch of infantry, the result is usually critical in a match. Another feature is that vehicles and heavy weapons (AT-guns, MGs) which are critically damaged and abandoned can be recrewed, repaired and added to your army. Maybe not unique in the RTS world, it is done excellently in this game.Veterans of the original Assault Squad will mainly see graphical and engine improvements and a few new units and maps wrapped in a fresh package at a low price as far as new games go. Do not, however, expect a brand new game, which it has never claimed to be.  "

								Terrible. Getting refund... (I have decided to keep the game even tho steam offered me a refund. JUST for the mods unless the devs do a 180 degree turn with their plans and make it more like AS1 when it comes to ranges etc)Totaler krieg will fix everything!TL;DR All the ranges have been shortened, tanks shoot like pistols ranges now. the HUD has been made into a confusing cluster fug. The levels are still the SAME (with a few imported from previous games which weren't in AS1... I don't think there are many TOTALLY new maps), there aren't many new units, at all. (a few tanks, yay) The AI is still CRAP. The pathfinding is still basicly the same, horrible mess that it was.The only thing they seem to have spent their time alot on is the new lobby system which is fine.. (Oh and camouflages Hoo-fudging-ray!) I would have been happy to pay 20€ for lobby & performance fixes on AS1 but no, they had to change the game mechanics which didnt need to be changed at allOh and i like the addittion of steam workshop.. This would have been such a great game if they had just focused on adding new content, and fixing flaws in the old game.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I have played Assault squad 1 for a whopping 1300 hours, and i am (was) a real fan of the assault squad series. I do realize this game is still in beta, and it runs really really bad on most computers, but i have not taken that into account, only the flaws in the game design and gameplay. This would have been a great game if they hadn't tried to make it like CoH3 or something.It still has the unique Men of war feel, but the ranges man, the ranges.. so godawful... in addittion to everything else they messed up. Unit icons on the left are a really hard-to-see and confusing mess, the HUD generally is very very confusing and theres alot of unneeded stuff on your screen, what limits your field of view. I honestly don't see any improvements on the AI or the pathfinding (except that neat path that shows where they will go)The tank Ranges used to be fun and challenging, except a maybe little too short, but now your tanks have no choice but to get into the frontline with your infantry and get bazooka'd. This might rise up the importance of infantry but for all the wrong reasons. In assault squad 1 you could easily take out a tank with infantry if you had any tactics and perhaps some stealth too.The infantry seem to be really tough now, which is unrealistic and totally lame. There used to be a time when you had to crawl your men through the battlefield to not make them die from a Buzzsaw (mg42) but now you can just throw them out to the field with only minor damage to them by bullets. And infantry behind cover... I like the suppression thing they added... but the way infantry only takes cover when they are hit is silly, As an infantryman you take cover when you are being shot at and you get supressed, The current system is like you can keep an enemy infantryman behind cover as long as you hit him once every 5 seconds or so...

								As a veteran of 450+ hours on Men of War: Assault Squad and a closed beta tester of this game, I feel inclined to give a review. Men of War Assault Squad 2 is a both a step forward that just has a little way to go before it is a success. It features some fantastic new features, namely the UI, steam support, and graphical enhancements. New missions give the single player more life than the challenging, yet monotonous skirmishes of its predecessor. The new vehicle textures are spectacular, including unique camoflage based on environment. Although the infantry textures are somewhat outdated, they don't detract from the game, same with the foliage and shaders. Once again, a relatively steep learning curve is displayed, requiring refined skills that can only be achieved through dedicated online play. You CANNOT just jump in and expect to win like other RTS games. You have to be patient and learn from your mistakes. Furthermore, you must dedicate yourself to learning the wider variety of control features the game displays, including the glorious direct control mode that allows for the most epic tank maneuvers you'll experience within the genre, the intuitive unit equiping system that allows you to loot and recover lost weapons and ammo, and finally the vehicle damage/penetration/component damage system, repairing vehicles based on where they were hit. Each of these features are what seperate the Men of War games from the rest of the genre, and mastering them is the key to success in multiplayer and getting over that curve. The only qualm I have so far with the game is the multiplayer connection glitches. 1 in every 2 games I have played so far have poor framerates, disconnects, or straight up crashes. This makes multiplayer somewhat unplayable for me right now, whereas Assault Squad 1 had very few online issues. I'm confident, however, that the developers will have the multiplayer optimized by the full release, and as I understand, very few other players have had these issues. Overall, I definatly reccommend this game to both veterans of the series and new players who want a massive tactical challenge. So long as you don't give up, this series can become one of the most rewarding and intuitive experiences you'll ever find. PS: To those who would compare this to Company of Heroes, they are different on fundamental levels. COH is an arcade style fast paced base builder with nowhere near as much thought to detail and realism on the level that MOW displays, but is a very fun game for what it is. Don't compare them, just enjoy them both based on what you find to be most satifying.			"

												I want to like this game. I really do. I love the possibilities. In fact, I grew an interest for this game after I became disillusioned with War Thunder; and the video of the Ratte mod that was posted to YouTube by the RakcroyBrosGaming channel sold me on buying this game. I really wish I did my ♥♥♥♥ing homework. Game play mechanics are solid. So far, all that I have been able to play bits and pieces of the single player campaign/""skirmishes"", no mods. The gameplay itself is all combat; with little to no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t concerning economics in terms of building factories, barracks,  *MUST ACQUIRE MORE VESPENE GAS*  etc, save for the occasional supply truck run to give ammo and/or fuel to single units that have run low. Very straightforward. No need to break out an excel sheet to figure out 'optimal output' paces or anything, that's what I like to see in an RTS. The game play is fairly driven by 'stats' too, especially on the subject of vehicle combat. Armor thickness, type, slope, all taken into account as to whether a vehicle will survive or not, and not one vehicle is truly 100% safe from the other due to this level of detail. I love it.The game play also allows for plenty of organic ""whoops"" moments on both sides. AT infantry attacks an OPFOR tank, kills the driver. Tank keeps rolling like nothings happened, you the player become hesitant that the attack was effective; until you notice it's going to roll straight into (and through) 3-4 houses filled with OPFOR. Said houses collapse on tank, which also blows up from the drop. Absolutely horrifying and breathtakingly awesome at the same time. That being said, the fun stops there.This game is an absolute nightmare to run. Bugs that are laughably persistent, and affect the most basic of functions. I'm not talking about hardware optimization, as this thing (while still looking dated, graphically) looks fine, not much in terms of framerate drops or anything of that nature. No, I'm talking about an over-abundance of file crashes. No other problems with any other games. I haven't had any files mysteriously disappear, and my drives seem healthy as can be.But every single ♥♥♥♥ing time I know autosave is about to occur, I hold my breath like a person playing russian roulette. Manual save feels even worse to me, because it's 100% self inflicted. Why? Because every time a save occurs, there is an unnacceptably high chance that the save will fail; and I will be greated with a string of text/code telling me things like ""NOT SDL FILE"", or ""Failed to save thumbnail/screenshot"". It is also likely that when these errors occur, the game will fail to load unless you manually delete the (now corrupted) save. You will also (likely) need to delete some combo of files, like keys.set, options.set, settings.set, etc. Otherwise, the game will not run. Now, these are solutions that are posted on the game's FAQ, written by the developers. The only problem is that it's only a cure for the symptom, and it never solves the actual *problem.* It only brings the game back into ""can now run/execute/playable"" status, but sooner or later, after another half-hour/40 minutes of gameplay; you will have another save failure that will crash the game, and you will not be able to play it again unless you delete some combination of files mentioned above. Steam-cloud sync is turned off. No mods installed. No interference from an Antivirus. This is all from the game, latest update and all. Running Windows 7, 64 bit. i5 2500k. Asus Sabertooth P67 (rev 3) mobo. 8 gigs of Corsair Vengeance RAM. ASUS GTX 570ti.  2 Seagate Barracuda 7200rpm 1TB drives. Can't be the hardware causing trouble.With these errors, the longest gameplay session I've ever had was somewhere between an hour and an hour-thirty minutes. The game is lost. The files deleted. Progress gone. Back to square one. I can't even begin to *fathom* what the ♥♥♥♥ kind of errors will pop up if I attempt a multiplayer match.			"

												Minimal changes to the predecessor.For my review i will list the features this game got:-recycled mission from the predecessor-so much bloom that it will make your eyes hurt and absolutely no option to reduce the gamma-some new models, next to the other 98.74% of the models that are 1 to 1 ripped from the predecessor-the new models got textures that the modding community of the predecessor did allready better(i am serious, the old models look with the community's textures better than the new ones)At all 25€ for bloom that will cause your eyes permanent damage, and new content (in comparison to the predecessor) that is less than any call of duty dlc ever offered.This game is a standalone patch thats contents were before announced as patch for the predecessor.They just added more bloom and added a 25€ pricetag.This game is a joke compared to the ones before in the series. An expensive joke.			"

												*Updated 2/17/2015 with the release of the latest large scale patch*Hated by casuals, loved by the hardcore enthusiasts, MoW continues it's time-tested formula of unrelenting combat in a realistic light. If this is your first foray, be forewarned: This ain't your Daddy's Company of Heroes. The learning curve is steep, but the basics are easy to learn. If 'micro' is a term that makes you shudder, look elsewhere. If base building is a deal breaker, look elsewhere. If you want to rush techs and move large blobs at your enemy, look elsewhere.This is a 'thinking man's' RTT. Units have their own stamina, inventory, and complex hitboxes. Though infantry are summoned on-map in squads, they can and often are broken up into small groups or as individuals. Cover AND concealment are fully functional in game, and the environment is fully destructable. Enemies held up in a fortified house? Why not bring the roof down on them with an AT grenade? Or light the building next to it on fire and let it spread to them? Heck, you can even get ridiculous and drive a tank through it and crush them alive, which brings up the major feature of this game: Direct control.Units can be taken control of on a deeper level, played much like a third person shooter, where you can crawl about as infantry, cook grenades, handle a sniper rifle, hold the line with a machine gun, or clear out a trench with a flamethrower. Or perhaps you prefer to man the controls of a tank, and enjoy the best penetration and hitbox system for tanks in the RTS genre, where it's important to choose proper ammo types and hit specific parts of a vehicle to damage systems, kill crew, or even get lucky and send a turret flying off.The weak will be punished, but those that stick with it(Or better yet, find friends to enjoy the game with in either Co-op or PvP) while find one of the most satisfying and truly dynamic games in the RTS genre.Pros:-unrivaled dynamic play. there is no real 'meta' or build orders to adhere to, playstyles adjust to tactical situations, not the other way around. No two games play the same!-Satisfying realism, if it would work in real life, it would probably work in-game.-US, UK, Germany, Soviet Union, and Japan all come with their own campaigns, and robust armories.-Beautiful levels of detail, especially in vehicles.-Unique gameplay-Great modding community, and steam workshop support.-Dedicated developers, always getting new patches and features. Just recieved a major update patch that adds new gameplay features and refines older ones.-Unique style of play that forgoes base construction and economy farming in favor of persistent combat and steady income for unit call ins.Teching is based on time, rather than construction and research.Cons:-Steep learning curve. Recently, the latest patch included tutorials, however, and this issue is largely resolved if you invest the time to learn.-inconsistant AI behaviour. Sometimes it's really brilliant, sometimes it's supremely dumb.-inventory management can be cumbersome at times.-If you played the first game, the sequel is barely a sequel at all. It's almost 99% identical, but on steamworks instead of gamespy. The latest patch has added some new features, however, that have some bigger changes in gameplay. Namely, the new supply system, and unit veterancy.-Though it's optional in lobby matches, matchmaking forces a 'unit locking' system where you must grind through unlock progression to unlock basic tools on the battlefield, leading to terrible balance situations.Despite it's 'rough around the edges' package, this is a solid game in a genre that is rife with imitation of games from 15 years ago. Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is a breath of fresh air in a realm of 'C&C' and 'Starcraft' copy-cats and games that try to do what Men of War does, but with terrible controls like Theatre of War and Graviteam tactics and a turtles pace. MoW is a fast-paced, tactical, unforgiving conquest with good controls and a good presentation, with ever evolving features and support that steadily address it's shortcomings.2/16/2015: Patch added unit veterancy, automatic resupply for infantry and vehicles near supply trucks/crates, reworked stamina system, graphical improvements, and greater server stability. Balance changes were also included.4/5			"

												Not Recommended-Low FPS during big fights on beefy systems-Overall pretty dated graphics-Small maps-Low unit capThe ability to take direct control over each of your units is fun for a while, but in the end it's completely overrun by everything that's just plain bad about the game.There's a decent tactical edge to the singleplayer campaigns (within the confines of the map and how they designed it for each specific engagement), but multiplayer is just a rush based slug fest for the most part.Overall it comes together to make a pretty badly optimized, mundane and underwhelming WW2 RTS game. It aims for more realism than the Company of Heroes series but fails, adding ontop of it a bunch of issues that CoH simply doesn't suffer from.With that being said, the models in MoW:AS2 are well made and the ability to take control of your units adds a new level of playability that some may find more appealing than similar games in the genre, but I can't recommend it based on my experience.Overall rating: 6/10TL:DR:""Underwhelming"" "

												This is a really good game. The game is very 'customizable' in a way to say that you can control each individual unit and edit their inventory and stuff like that. The game is also quite realistic. However, I feel that there should be some improvements to the realism aspect as your tank can nudge an unarmored vehicle and blow it up. Overall, its a good game and I reccomend it.			"

												This game is terribly awful, that I can't hardly fathom how people play this monstrosity. The AI are as intelligent as mentally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ kids with shoes in their mouths. The units can hardly manage to hit enemies ten feet in front of them, grenades look like puffs of smoke, I just can't. I held a bridge for about thirty minutes, expended thousands of rounds, and manged to kill but maybe thirty germans. I'd rather pay for the original MOW ten times over than pay for this piece of excrement once.			"

												The re-design of the GEM2 engine in AS2 has been a huge step forward - DMS is taking the steps in the right direction.Assault Squad 2 has reached nearly 10,000 simultaneous players. That is a great achievement that has brought a lot of popularity for this RTS saga, and let's hope it carries on. Despite the current glitches and issues, AS2 has great potential, and i'm sure a competent developer like DMS will surely finish off with a great game.			"

Intense battles or sneaky missions it is your choise even in multiplayer(I love to get a few spetznas going raiding against my friends flanks).

								By far the best RTS game available. I played the whole serie and still it is never boring.Played the 1st part over 200 hours, this one will beat the 200 hours I think.If you like RTS buy this gamePlayed the game for a year now, it is still great (although I did not hit the 200 hours). There are several fantastic mods to play and the speed of the game is due several updates much improved.			"

												What im about to say is difficult for me to articulate without sounding like a noob who cant play or someone who's computer is a potatoe. I am a master league sc2 player and my pc has a radeon 6850, just for clarification. I have also tested this on a friends pc  and everything is the same.  I have noticed that if you issue commands very quickly they do not register and its as if you never issued them. e.g. If you select 5 groups of men and move them all by rapidly pressing the correct # keys then clicking with your mouse, often only the first group or two will have received the command despite you pressing each group key then clicking. This also happens when trying to rapidly click and drag over units and grouping them, jumping between several vehicles to change ammo, telling multiple artillery to fire on ground, telling a squad to throw several gernades, ect.This will happen in offline skirmish with graphics as low as they go.This just seems to be how the game is programmed, its like the game can only process APMs so fast and if you go beyond that it doesn't work. I suppose this could be a hardware problem on my and my friends end, perhaps our Cpus are too weak or something like that. But i dont know, in sc2/planetary annihilation i can issue commands as fast as my body will let me, i can rapidly hit group keys and issue move orders and everyone of those commands works and they all start moving. In Sc2 i can click and drag and make up 5 groups in about 2 seconds, in MOWAS2 this is just impossible.I asked my friend if he noticed this and he said he didn't, i went over to his home and reproduced it, clearly noobs cannot see this problem; you have to be able to micro. I am an armchair historian and i enjoy this game because of that and also i suspect eveyone has this APM cap to deal with so its not like anyone has an unfair edge But still if you are a high ranked RTS player and you know how to micro, sometimes this game will make you want to stick a fork in your eye.

								There is a common misunderstanding that sequels usually suck. NOT true with this iteration of Men of War!  This takes everything awsome about the first and builds upon it.  But it does it in such a way that it doesn't take away from the expierience.  It provides a first of all FAR more engaging AI within the game now.  My biggest gripe about the first game was the fact that the AI seemed scared to go on the offensive.  Now the AI is extremely aggressive and can actually be quite difficult to beat at times.  The graphical changes seem to be pretty minor compared to the first game but they do put some nice touches to the vehicles.  What I am most excited for however is the integration of a massive amount of Skirmish coop battles.  According to the devs, there will be a total of 40 skirmish battles when the game is released.  In addition to that, the steam support for the game is an EXTREEEEMELY welcome addition compared to the last game which allows easy sharing of missions and mods in the community.  Another nice addition is the usage of your steam account for in-game leveling.  If you are fan of the Men Of War series...THIS...IS...A MUST HAVE!!!!  Get it while its on sale for $25.  See you all on the battlefield...			"

												I am truly on the fence with MoW: AS II. On one hand, the game is quite solid and does not fail where its predecessor succeeded, but at the same time I see few improvements. The modding seems comprehensive and the multiplayer system is far more streamlined (In my opinion), yet, I find it hard to reccomend this title. There is simply too little built upon from the original by what I've seen. If this were on sale for a good price (which it typically is) I can reccomend picking it up. However, I bought this game at the current price ($29.99) and quickly refunded it, but I do intend to pick it back up later at a cheaper price. As it stands, I can not suggest buying Men of War: Assault Squad II at full price. Just wait for the next big sale.			"

												I don't see how this game got as many positive reviews as it did. I assume because the people who played it did not get the first one. Because that's all this game really is. it is literally just like the first one, all the same campaign mission, most of the same units. Also this game runs like Sh*t. This game is, as I said before, almost exactly the same as the first one only 4X the price. I'm just glad i bought this for $7.49 and not the $29.99 that they were asking for a few weeks ago. $7.49 for this game is still way too high. so all in all, DO NOT buy this game, just go buy the first one if you want a game like this that bad.

												I have over 600 hours on AS1. I have to say, I am majorly disappointed in this game. Like everyone else is saying, this feels like a worse version of AS1. The grenade timer feels very nooby and unnecessary. The performance is even worse, and the game has dissolved into 3+ assault squads at the beginning of every game. Just watch the good players play and you'll see this. It gets boring and repetitive. Whoever gets the lucky grenade pretty much wins the whole game, as it is near-impossible to recover from a beginning loss. AS1 was better because you could call in vehicles earlier to stop yourself from being swarmed and mgs were more effective in holding off waves.  Wah Wah! I let people gain an advantage over me early on and I don't deserve to be punished with people dug in on a point! DMS make it so I can charge head on into MGs and people in cover and actually win.The balancing also needs some work even after 6 months of continuous analysis by the best players on the game.I would go back to AS1 immediately if gamespy wasn't down.

												I'm going to be honest and harsh here, the game feels unpolished. It feels like an Early Access RTS game that still needs everything (really, everything, from sounds to animations) to be redone but on a professional level instead.I have an extremely expensive audio setup at home including two studio monitor speakers and an audio interface; the sounds in this game are horrible, it's like the sounds belong to a game created back in 2006. Optimisation is also a huge issue in this game, I have an i7 7700k and a gtx 1080, yet I cant keep this game at 60 fps in 1440p while much better looking games allow me to run them in 4K at a consistent 60 fps. This game uses more resources than the Witcher 3.Not to mention, even if your pc can run this game in 4K, the UI becomes extremely small and the game doesn't allow you to scale the UI anywhere; useless.If you're looking for a polished WW2 RTS game I recommend Company of Heroes 2, this game is definitely not worth the 25 euros it's asking on the Steam store. 5 euros would be more like it.

I haven't played anything from the MoW series up until now, and having played a few hours it reminds me of one of my favourite games of all time, Soldiers: Heroes of World War 2. So I'm pretty amazed how this series has escaped me for all these years.I love the diverse tactical approach to different situations, and I also love the inventory system.

												If you are a fan of the Men of War series you will love Assault Squad 2. There is not a MAJOR difference from the first MoW:AS. There are various bugs and issues that have been fixed from the original. Also if you enjoy playing MoW online I recommend buying this game. Since this is currently the newest and most polished MoW there are more players to play with on AS2. If you are new to this series but enjoy ww2 RTS games I highly recommend this game. It is in between some of the more hardcore games such as Theatre of War and the more arcade casual Company of Heroes series. I feel it is the perfect balance of realism and fun. It has historically acurate units and armor penetration values. For added realism there are many mods that can enhance this aspect of the game. For players new to the series it will not seem as user friendly in the way Company of Heroes is. I have spent hours playing this series and still go back for more. I have yet to be bored with this game. I would personally give this game an 8/10.			"

												Really fun game, when it works. Atrocious amounts of glitches and bugs. Be prepared to fight the unresponsive soldiers, inability to resupply some units, your commands not being obeyed, and soldiers being stuck on their way to designated position, i.e. unable to go around obstacles, and stepping in place. AI seems infinetely stupid, and a bit overpowered, i.e. constant suppply of them is a bit overdone. Micromanagement is ridiculous, i.e. you need to re-supply all squads under fire,  but supply units are first to be fired upon. Snipers are useless, as they can't see any further than other units, and can't shoot very quickly, so they will do a kill every now and then, and that's all. Waves of incoming units are ridiculous, as there's no time to re-supply properly, or actually fight the resupply system, as soldiers just don't want to re-supply in most cases. There's no control over how and when vehicles like tanks fire from their main gun and when from the MG. Don't get me wrong, it's really nice game, but ridden with bugs. Btw... when you get angry and frustrated due to such issues, ALT-F4 doesn't work.			"

												Single player campaign seems to be simillar for all the different factions (at least for the first mission). I only bought this game for the multiplayer and I can report there wasn't much of an experience there. The fps somehow is linked to the other players internet connection and results in getting very low fps (13ish) sometimes. The main problem I have is that there simply isn't much people playing mp. There was only one non-passworded room and it was running a mod that I didn't have downloaded. When I joined a different game to play I got kicked by the host because I'm a noob. I tried making my own room and no wanted to play me after 5 minutes of waiting. Even in the one 1v1 game I did get to play, there was visible lag on the units at times.Some of the graphics and animations in the game seem to be low quailty.I think there is a lot more value in the campaign of company of heroes 1 compared to this game.

												The game looks like a lot of fun but it is totally not in a functional state. The forum is full of people with critical crashes and frequent errors, including myself.

												The singleplayer is freaking annoying and frustrating, the more forces you have under control the worse the game becomes. AI is stupid as hell, soldiers lie down near grenade to be blown into pieces, tanks are being driven by lobotomized monkeys who after being order to attack enemy's tanks can't take appropriate position for firing and either stand still or take ridiculos routes to be vaporised by some AT gun they decided to pass by. Being under sniper fire any troops just doing nothing, being popped one by one, not trying to hide or drop down, nothing. If you overlooked a sniper kiss your troops he is after a goodbuy, they will just obidiently die one by one. Not a freaking mesasage ""you're under sniper fire"". In order to make your soldiers fight properly you have to slow down time and take control manually in the zones where ♥♥♥♥ is happening. The more forces you have the more annoying it becomes, while you babysitting your tank on the left flank, you stupid morons of soldiers are getting slaughtered on the right flank. If you want to win and minimize casualties you have to micromanage EVERYTHING. I got the game for the weakend, and NO WAY IN HELL I'm buying this piece of crap afterwards. The game is only playable when you have couple of platoons and 2-3 tanks, more than that - and the game becomes a freaking mess and a micromanagement fair. F this ♥♥♥♥, I'm back to Company of Heroes, that game doesn't have the inventory, different types of ammo, fuel for tanks, the vehicles looks a bit more cartoonish - yes, but at least CoH is PLAYABLE. I can play it for hour or more without suicidal thoughts. Oh my god, I'm so furious at the MoW now... The singleplayer in this game is awful, this mechanics are not suited for big maps and big armies, since there is too much happening around and the AI is stupid as hell. Also too much random - tanks miss in most cases, and if the shot does connect you never know what will happen, enemy's PZ4 can survive dozen shots from T34, and in the next skirmish T34 oneshots your PZ4 with it's first shot. Or other way around, it only matter of luck, the higher caliber the more chances you get, but it's anyway too random. Ok, I let some steam out. Resume - if you are into singleplayer - this game has a very annoyning one, full of micromanagement and direct control of units, while playing on the slowest time setting available. I regret investing time in it... MoW was a nice series until this assault squad crap corrupted it.			"

												This should've probably been released as an expansion. In terms of gameplay, it's virtually identical to Assault Squad 1. However, the engine has been revamped, so the game runs WAY better in singleplayer (at the moment, multiplayer is bogged down by bugs and lag, unfortunately.)Ultimately I'm glad I bought it, but it's weird to see a developer so blatantly re-sell a ""sequel"" that is almost a carbon copy of the original on the surface.

												Overall great game. Editor is fun, mods are great, and if you and your buddies get on you can have hours of banter and fun but as of patch 3.250.0 my game is unplayable. I've followed the instructions on how to fix it, I've installed x86 just like the change-log said to do, and it still crashes on launch. If anyone can tell me what I'm doing wrong feel free to share.biggest issue is that every update seems to break the game in some way			"

												This game is quite a diamond in the rough. It has a steep learning curve, but is a must-have for major RTS and WWII fans. The game truly shines when playing cooperatively with friends, especially with the wealth of custom game modes and historical battles such as D-Day, Okinawa, Kursk and many others, which can all be found on the Steam Workshop or on related websites. This game really doesn't have that many players, so it would be nice to see more, as it is again, a absoultly fabulous game.			"

												This game is definitely underrated and highly enjoyable to even the most non rts type players once you work out the kinks.Though not without issues, this game is a master piece.Gameplay- 10/10Without a doubt, this game caters to a more precise crowd of people. The level of control over your units alone is enough to salivate the most hardcore of fans in the RTS genre. The actual battles themselves? Pure unadulturated goodness. Your troops actually matter. Their positions actually matter. The different types of units actually matter. In other games things like AA guns and some MG placements just get killed early and barely make any difference in the fight. COH2 being one such example. However in this game, each and every unit can have a massive affect on the battle. Very unique playstyles can be done in this game. Content - 10/10The fact that it has 5 fully fleshed out factions is amazing in itself. Other such games in this genre could learn from this. The amount of units within these factions is awesome as well. Yeah some of them are copy and paste but it definitely is enjoyable to be to have diversity. Graphics -6/10 Somewhat lacking given the year this came out in. Though I understand it's difficult to do RTS games with amazing graphics and still have everything running correctly. Still, aesthetically pleasing for the most part.Story - 5/10Not played too much of the story. But pretty similar to other such games in this genre. Typical WW2 scenarios and plot driven kill the enemy type scenarios. Cinematics - 2/10 One of the only things I find annoying about this game is the little cut scenes in some of the missions, especially during a skirmish when playing with a friend and you lose track of your units when it comes on. Music - 3/10 The music gets extremely repetitive. Controls - 9/10The controls takes a lot of getting used to if you want to be good. However, they are there for a purpose and once you figure it all out you are a master of the battlefield.Multiplayer - 9/10One of my only cons about this game is that during the Multiplayer if someone has a terrible connection or a not so good graphics card, everyone tends to suffer from lag. I've yet to play a game where the MP was extremely stable and there wasn't some weird frame skipping when you moved players.  Other than that, it's addicting. You willl never feel so satisfied as you do when you win multiplayer matches. It is absolutely addicting. It's been a long time since a game has made me feel like this.  Overall, this game is absolutely worth the price, especially on sale! "

												What can I say that hasn't already been said in every other review. The A.I is cancer. Community can be cool sometimes, most of the time they suck. But the game itself is something. I probably should have reviewed this earlier but eh. Now the if you're not directly controlling your units they get themselves killed...Now I know this is starting to sound like a bad review but, the one thing that makes this game sooooo worth it are the mods. Find friends make them get the mods and ♥♥♥♥ing wreck each other. Without mods this game would be mediocre at best but with them Jesus ducking Christ. Modding community is amazing for this game. If a mod is popular it shouldn't be too hard to set up a public game might need to wait a little. If you're like me and don't have friends, well the modding community covers that too. They add new missions, campaigns and even wave defense. Like I said with mods this game is pretty awesome.			"

												Bought this DLC for the AI, been waiting forever for AI for this game! and to support the DEVS and might i say they did not dissapoint! The added on AI is amazing and fun! they play strictly with assault zones so far and even with the Modded Map packs that i have downloaded! There are some stuff the AI does pretty stupidly from time to time like charging in artillary peices as tanks, or using tanks as infantry to cap assault points. But what AI doesnt have problems? can always be patched up! although any difficultly besides heroic can be pretty easy. heroic is just right for me i feel since theres a lot of stuff to deal with and counter! perfect for practicing with! I havent tried the airborne missions though but knowing their singleplayer tendencies its most likely great! Id say if your tired of facing complaining humans in the MP or being kicked all the time for stupid reasons BUY THIS DLC!! its worth every penny! and its fun facing the AI when it doesnt mess up! always fun to comp stomp or if your at work to kill a little time! Great job Devs hats off to ya! keep up the great work!			"

												Loads of fun, tactical strategy game mixed with a slight RPG element in which you can equip your guys with ammo, helms and bullets. There are micromanagement aspects to it that help you take control of an individual unit.This game is especially fun with friends (what game isn't?). Have your friend (or yourself) call out strats, while you can micromanage your units. Then dish out an insane amount of hurt with whatever shared resource funding is allotted to your team.My most favorite (albeit annoyingly stereotypical) aspect of this game is its call in units, specifically, the Soviet's ""For the Motherland!"" ability.  Would Order No. 227 the fascists while blaring the soviet anthem or worker's marseillaise anyday of the week.			"

												This game is somewhat a two sided dice.It's quite ok at lower difficulty setting. However at heroic setting the game ditches all and any realism. Enemy units see through foliage, lack any and all recoil mechanisms and friendly armored units become completely useless because they just cant see/detect/hit or penetrate the enemy armor (up to 40 hits to take down a medium tank, right, realism).All in all, i recommend a playthrough on the easy settings but stay away from hard or hardcore. The coding errors and blatantly broken ai make it a save/load torture. I mean where is the common sense that an enemy infantry runs infront of a 2x10 squads and nobody shoots/hits. Seriously.Verdict: Not recommended due to broken mechanism which are not apparent on lower difficulty settings.			"

												I want to like the game. Its innovative, and 10 times better than Company of Heroes. But the missions are exactly the same format almost every time, and half the maps are pulled from the original Assault Squad.Edit: AI balance issues seem to have been fixed a little maybe, or maybe its because i hold my tanks in reserve more.Balance Issues exist. AI tanks are OP as hell. I faced an AI with 4 tanks vs his one. 2 of them were recovered tanks that were the same type as the medium tank i was facing. He wiped out all of my tanks, while my units (and an AT gun) blasted away at his weaker side armor from a stopped and stabilized position. There is realism. And then there is absolute lunacy.Easy mode, your tanks are invincible which isnt fun. Normal, the enemy tanks are invincible but the troops are realistic and challenging. Cmon. There shouldnt be such a jump. Easy is TOO easy. and Normal you might as well just use troops exclusively without your useless tanks.			"

												AwesomeThis game is about micromanagement in a ww2 battlefield what it does very well. It is just a thrill to capture a whole base with just a few soldiers. But when not acting corectly you can lose a lot of soldiers. The game is build around realism, it is posible to repair tanks when they are knocked out but not destroyed completely.Tanks in the game do not have a hit bar it is a chance that a bulit hits on the vulnerable places, because of this your tank can be destroyed when the first bullit hits (taking to accaunt the armor thickness) or can be completely functional after loads of hits.Men of War as2 does not give much improvement over men of war as1. But it is better than as1, runs better and has new units and other small improvements.If you have as1 and you like it a lot buy as2, but keep in mind that it is't a whole new game.As a conclution the game is a very good world war 2 strategy game with micromanagement.I like to play it with frends.I also think this game is a lot better than company of heroes (2).

												Good game that could be better.I recommend this game to wwii fans out there wanting to play this type of game but have never tried the previous titles like the assault squad 1. However if you played it before, don't bother with this title unless it's on a huge sale because the developers did not pay enough effort into making this a better game.I would say that this is the best wwii rts game out there right now, but the problem remains as there is a large room for possible improvments in terms of the types of skirmish missions available to the players.They're all basically the same type of missions and most of them are carried over from the assault squad 1.

												I honestly love this game. Not to sound like a hipster, but it truly is underrated in the sense that it is a fantastic WWII strategy game. The modding community is strong, with them ranging from unlimited points in campaign, high detailed co-op and multiplayer maps. WARNING: this game can and will get very dull without mods. For (high quality) mods, I recommend DJSatane, Vashyo, and SirHinkel for extra missions ranging from the beaches of Normandy to the three stages of Stalingrad. 15.786/9.9 would sacrifice 200 Russian Conscripts for one objective like a true Comrade again			"

												Very fun, played during the free weekend. Will soon buy.Pretty much, your in control of a small miltary force, you then must fight to take control of capture points and such.Really fun when your moving your small squad in a flanking manuver and they get slaughtered by the machine gun you didnt notice.One time, in a epic battle, i had my 2 of the most powerfull tanks (and some of the best in the game i think) charge the enemy, and there tracks were both destroyed.No other reinforcements could reach them, so alone, they took out over 20 enemy tanks. Eventually i got a squad to them, the squad managed to repair one but the other was destroyed, killing all but one solider, I then had the last man help man the tank, and drove to base. Only to have that tank finally get detroyedEnd battle:I had 1 man left, no reinforcements(all dead), the enemy had 1 tank. My soldier had no Anti-Tank genades, and the nearest body was in the open, where the tank would shoot me, I ran for cover in a building, where there was a dead solider, i looted him and got a gernade.I then charged the tank and threw it, right as the tank opened fire.My solider managed to survive :)10/10 Most epic battle ever 2015			"

												Bought this game expecting much the same as COH.  Have to say the detail is much greater than I had expected.  (picking up and using dropped weapons, vehicle damage is down to the panel hit, soldiers helments flying off when shot).  I do think some of the historical accuraces in terms of when certain weapons and tanks become available leave a lot to be desired in the scenarios.Whilst this is squad oriented you can move individual soldiers, this can be a help and a hinderance.. it does become a bit to much like micro management.. i.e having to heal troops when a medic is right next to them, or having to individually supply troops with new ammo when they are all standing around the supply truck... this does leave it a little frenetic in the heat of battle.I started the game on normal difficulty which seems REALLY difficult.. so switched to easy which seems far to easy so struggling with getting the right tempo.. artillery strikes are rediculously accurate in the scenarios.. to the point a nebellwerfer was more pinpoint accurate than an 88.....and loaded and fired more quickly it seemed.Apart from those little gripes the scale of the maps, certain micro management (in house out specific window) and the overall game play gave it a slightly more 'real war' feel vs COH (certainly COHII) COH is still one of the best , WWII squad games available but this is up there.
