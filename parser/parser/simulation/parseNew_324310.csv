												֍ Not perfect, needs some work. Hands down more accessible and stable than OSMI 2. I streamed this for about 8 hours yesterday. It only crashed once. I guess if you have a potato pc then it might seem laggy. Overall my biggest complaints are no TrackIR support and the steering was hard to get smooth with my Thrustmaster RS500. All in all it is a pretty decent cheap game. Please note that most of the negative reviews have barely ANY time playing it. Please look at playtime when checking out the reviews here on Steam. Pros:♥ Innovative scenerios that pop up as you drive♥ Random conversations with the passengers♥ Modding ability (should bring this game to a whole new level)♥ Challenging conditions♥ No scenerio where you need to know the bus routes in Berlin in 1988 (which my wife from Germany couldnt even help me with). ♥ Simple GPS that works better than floating signs in the skyCons:♡ GPS arrow should always point UP. It rotates and some of the roads get winding so it makes it hard to tell which way to turn at intersection♡ Lack of TrackIR meant that its hard to turn your head and see oncoming traffic. I ended up killing 4 or so people and hit about 15 cars in 8 hours.♡ Easy to go bankrupt if you try going too fast♡ Decals and stickers are not rotateable so the ads sometimes look stupidClosing thoughtsOverall this is a fine niche game. Look kiddos, it is not every day we get a bus sim. Stop being obtuse and see the good in things why dont ya? Bah Bah Baaaahhhh. That is all			"

												I decided to rewrite my review to make it more helpful.Some pros of the game:- Affordable price- Support for steering wheels- Quality despite simplicityFollowing may be pro/contra depending of what you are expecting:- Simple control- Simple game interface- A scenario which keep you busy for about 20 hours of gameplayKnown genetic problems of this publisher:- Game engine puts heavy load on your system- AI is not very good. (Without great fails though.)Some additional information:- I found I drive better with keyboard than with steering wheel.- Some people report 3-4 FPS. They have Intel HD graphics. Game should not be run with that graphics solution at all.- Some people report 30 FPS on lowest settings, while having 60-70 FPS on best settings in other games. Raise settings from lowest at least to average and you still will have 30 FPS but better experience. It is not graphics what is putting heavy load on your system it is game engine what cause that number of FPS.Recommendation:- Don't buy if you have non-top laptop.- Buy if you have steering wheel. (Not many games are utilizing that device good.)- Buy for kid. (Affordable price and good ethics in game.)- Buy for yourself if you have an hour or two after work and middle to top desktop. (Can be used in pair with weaker laptop with in-home streaming feature).With my kind regards,finomondo			"

YouTube™ Video: Everything you need to know about BusSimulator 16 in 5 minutes or less 

			Views: 3,806		

			Welcome to the very first Episode of the new format, I will tell you everything that I think you need to know about Bus Simulator in 5 minutes or less ( although I failed at the 5 minute part this...		

First up, if you don't have 4 Gig of ram you might find the game crash when it's loading up, IF it even starts to load up that is. WAIT FOR A PATCH Due to the fact that all assets are preloaded the game is a memory hog, that is not fun if you don't have the resources to spare. What's good about is the fact that by preloading you avoid all the issues that OMSI 2 has when it comes to moving around on maps.The Ambience sounds are well done and the fact that you can overhear the passenger talking and laughing and somewhat reacting to your driving style helps with your imersion.Engine sounds as well as sounds from the gearbox are mediocre, but they work until mods will fix it, and that bring us to the next point.The driving physics deserve some more TLC, the bus seems too easy to handle at times and too unforgiving at others, especially when you try to drive in and out of the depot the bump of the sidewalk is significantly overdone Mod support/ stem workshop support is what I believe will push the game from meh to wow. Overall I think it gets a lot right and does deserve the name Simulator as such it is of course best played with a wheel or at the very least a controller			"

												Bus Simulator 16 was developed by still alive studios and published by Astragon. The game released on the 2nd March 2016 for a price of £18.99. In Bus Simulator 16, you are in charge of a bus company and must also drive around the bus collecting and dropping off people on various routes. During my hour of playing this game I had many ups and downs but the eventual ending was me stuck outside my bus and also stuck outside the depot with no way back.Positives:+ Good attempt at an entry level bus simulator – The game was designed to be a really good bus simulator but unfortunately falls quite short of that bar. The game feels more entry level but a good attempt at it.+  Steam Workshop – With steam workshop there will be mods to improve the game and adding own designs and busses.+ Tutorial – The tutorial is pretty good and I’m glad I did it. The amount of options and choices to the game is overbearing at times but I feel after an hour more confident  to try and drive a bus around.+ Multiplayer – This is a great add to the game, you can play online and manage routes together too, the only problem for me is that I lack friends with the game + Cops/Police – When I was idle at the station trying to figure out buttons and such a Police car went flying past me with the lights on. I found this so cool – however it may just be normal for most people.Negatives:- Floaty handling – The handling is not too good on this game and most the time I end up crashing and bashing when taking corners because the handling is too light.- Overwhelmed – There are just so many options, buttons, choices in which you must do and then to add to the top of all that the doors get jammed and the customers expect you to give them change from money which you can’t really make out.- Voice acting – If you can make it through the game without laughing at the terrible voice acting I commend you. I laughed quite often due to this fact.- Long loading times – It may just be my PC but I experienced agonising load times and very bad FPS.- Price – I feel the price should be halfed for the product because although you get a lot of content the quality is subpar.Unfortunately I felt this game had a lot of potential but the execution was pretty bad. I was hoping to finally get an Omni 2 experience on Steam but unfortunately this falls well below expectations and to me feels more of an entry product. I could only recommend this game to people with low expectations or standards (huehue). I played this game only for an hour but  I was left out in Sunny Springs in the rain, trapped from my bus and depot. Although I slate the game I enjoyed it for what it was but can’t possibly recommend the game at the current price point. I’m just glad the game never crashed on me because that would’ve been the icing on the cake.Score: Wait for a sale			"

												I'm just reviewing this game not because I felt like it was something necessary to do, but to balance the user score.Bus Simulator 16 is a really good game! It allows you to drive and manage a bus on the road, plan its routes, take good care of its passengers, deal with misfortunes inside and outside of your bus, and it also allows you to macromanage your own bus company as a whole: buy buses and customize their exteriors with paints and decals, create and handle with your own routes so that you and your employees can make good use of them, make a nice profit, all a management sim could allow you to do.Of course the game has flaws! It's not too pretty visually, got some nasty bugs and a few performance issues, but considering that the developers aren't very resorceful and it's a small team working on, I couldn't expect a triple-A game. Also, they are patching up, fixing what thay can, and I expect a fair amount of remodeling so we can enjoy more of this fine piece of art.Bus Simulator 16 is a bit flawed, maybe overpriced too, but I think investing in an indie team is what makes the gaming gears running. You will not regret of this game.			"

												Game is really fun and has alot of 'feel' to it. it still needs more Optimizing done for sure , but if you have a Med-Great PC , you should be in great shape. PROS : - Business Simulation - City feels real- Buses feel real too- You can get out of your seat and walk around at will. - You can customise your buses as you see fit. (Stickers,Decals,Ads)CONS : - Slower PC's are not going to play this - NEEDS more optimizing - Only a few buses (So far) - You cannot see any other buses on the roads (Including yours that you hired)- Frame drops at random Look , just in one mans view , i like this game and i really hope that the Dev's keep on this and fix / add more in time. i feel the game has is goods with the bads , but in the end , it is what OMSI2 could only dream of being....and that is a Bus simulator that feels real and works without crashing . I rate this game a Solid 8.0 / 10/0			"

												Honestly, going into this game I was expecting not to enjoy more than 15 minuntes of it. In reality, I ended up playing the game signficantly longer than I expected to.Compared to other driving-job-simulator games, I thought the tutorial was really good at explaining all the critical components of the game. In turn, when the tutorial finishes you're equiped with everything you need to know to continue playing.Overall, the game is fun ... though, I'm not sure why... I mean, you're driving as a bus driver after all, but there is something calming about designing your routes, and driving throough german towns and cities.The only thing I wish they would fix is:1. More music options. If you can integrate with spotify that would be amazing.2. Slightly better textures for some of the objects, like the interior of the bus and other vehicles on the road.I would recommend this to those that like driving-job-simulator games, or for someone who hasn't tried this genre before.

												This game has given me a view of how difficult bus drivers have it, giving me an admiration for the drivers that turn up on time, in terms of the game its great! a fun sim that shows how hard it is to drive and cater to townspeoples transport needs, would recommend to sim lovers. free coffee provided!-Thank you sir i need a ticket, to the moon.Update: game will soon be well optimised, so all those people who make negative reviews because of that, you can review on how the game itself is.

												Have to say I'm quite annoyed at the number of negative reviews on this game.This is a very quality simulator, all be it with high run requirements. I have a fairly mid-high end PC, and I'm able to run it fine with no frame drops, freezing etc. As such, I will not comment any further on how the game runs, and i'll focus on the gameplay,The start of the game is a little silly, and I can imagine that the tutorial puts quite a few people off. At first I also thought that the game would be a lot more arcadey than it is (based on the tutorial).The part of the game that I love is the management side, unlike other Bus Simulation games you don't just hop into a bus and drive a pre-determined route. Sure, the actual bus might not be simulated to a high level of detail, but it has enough there to make it enjoyable and feel like a simulator.I was also very supprised to see that there is mod support...which is fantastic! I've created a custom logo for my company and imported it as a mod. I can now use it as a decal to place on my buses (Which is another great feature).One thing I noticed about this simulator, compared to other...non-super-realistic ones is that it doesnt punnish you as much. The ai traffic is fairly clever and will allow you to pull out of stops unharmed, and pedestrians will also wait before crossing the road if you're aproaching at speed.Another point on this, the ""score"" markers that appear in the bottom left, normally detailing something that you have done well, or done poorly. I was under the impression that all of these affect your star rating etc...but they don't!To give an example, my bus was diverted due to heavy traffic, and allong the diverted route a passenger requested that I stop. Upon stopping, the red marker popped up saying that I stopped at a stop that wasnt on the route. However, upon inspecting the tablet, which lists all of the factors that effect your rating it wasnt listed!All in all I find this simulator very enjoyable, which can't be said for a lot of modern simulation games. It seems as if the developers put a little bit of love into this title, which is always nice to see.			"

												It's not every time I review a game, but I thought the need to review this game was high! Bus Simulator 16 is set in the town of Sunny Springs. Not only are you a bus driver, but you have to deal with a variety of events that happen around you! Driving the Bus The driving and stability of the bus is relatively easy. I'm currently using a Logitech G27 and I'm able to turn the steering wheel with no problem. However, I feel it can be quite stiff sometimes, but I'm sure this will be improved. The Passengers The passengers are amazing. You get a variety of different talks whilst driving your bus, from calling in sick to work, talking to fellow passengers etc. Other than when I give passengers their ticket, they say 'Thank you dear'. There are also other events including asking a passenger to move so you can close the doors, helping a wheelchair user onto the bus where you may need to get out of your seat and operate it manually or press a button at the cab, turning the air con/heating up or down to the passengers' wish or even dealing with drunk passengers. Pedestrians also relatively behave probably, I do get the occasional event where a passenger walks out in front of me at a crossing and your current drive would end immediately. There are also other events including fixing a jammed door, where you need to get out of your seat and manually close the door.  Graphics and Textures The graphics overall are pretty good. I've been hearing reports about the textures glitching out and turning to grey, however I have not been getting this problem. A feature I do like is when it's raining and the trees blow around. Unfortunately, when it is raining, you don't get any rain effects on the windscreen which was quite a disappointment. There are wipers, but there is no point in really using these. The AI Vehicles  The AI's behaviour in-game is very good, they will react to your indicators very well, like when you are pulling out of a bus stop, the car behind you will stop and let you out. There does seem to be a glitch where if you are sat in the cockpit, you won't be able to see the AI's lights (indicators, brake lights) but you will be able to see them from outside of the bus. This might explain to some people why they have been crashing into the back of AI cars, which I have done a couple of times.  AI will also behave probably when at traffic lights or junctions, so the developers have done a good job on coding the AI vehicles! The FPS I get in-game The FPS I get in-game is relatively good to keep it stable. I get around 40-50FPS overall when driving around or walking about in my office/garage. I have been looking at the reviews where some people have put a thumbs down because of the poor FPS they get in-game. I seem to be one of the lucky ones where I don't get any FPS problems and can play the game with no problem. However, I'm sure for those who are getting problems that there will be a patch relatively soon.  Overall Conclusion Overall, I believe Bus Simulator 16 is a great simulator and is much better than the previous bus simulator I had, which was OMSI 2, which had no end of glitches, crashes and bad in-game optimization etc. It's not every day you get a good Bus Simulator like this, probably one of the best to date. There may be a few glitches and bugs there and there, but let's be grateful that we have a good Bus Simulator!			"

												This is a very engaging and interesting game. You do more than just drive a bus - you also have to manage your own bus company, organise routes, deal with a variety of interesting situations (bus malfunctions, demanding passengers etc.), buy new buses, hire new drivers and so on. You get missions that help you unlock new features. You're never short of something to do.Bus Simulator 16 is made by the same people who developed Bus Simulator 2012, albeit with a different partner this time. I gave Bus Simulator 2012 a negative review, but I am happy to say that Bus Simulator 16 is a vast improvement - with one exception. Bus Simulator 2012 had awful frame rates, and unfortunately, so does Bus Simulator 2016 at present. I played on medium graphic settings with a pretty powerful computer, but found the gameplay very laggy and choppy, although just bearable. But I can play games like Euro Truck Simulator 2 or Train Simulator 2016 on high settings and have no FPS issues. So this is an area that needs work. And apparently, the developers are working on it, so hopefully performance will be much better soon.Some areas where Bus Simulator 2016 has improved on BS 2012 include keyboard steering (much, MUCH better, more like Euro Truck or American Truck Simulator steering now), AI traffic (much more sensible, accidents are usually due to your bad driving rather than their stupidity) and user-friendliness of the bus interior (no more password to enter, selling tickets is now much more efficiently handled). And of course, it introduces new things that were never seen in BS 2012, like the whole company management deal, missions and so on.Other than the need for performance optimisation, I have few complaints about this game. It is definitely the best bus simulator since OMSI 2, and has real potential to give the latter a serious run for its money. I am more than happy to recommend it.			"

												One of the things this game has done correctly, is putting a lot of effort into  driving and operating the bus. This game does infact allow you emerge into a bus drivers life and will raise your blood pressure when passengers and traffic delay your tight time schedule. Pros Driving the bus feels realistic Cockpit view Manually operated cashier for selling tickets All operations of the bus can be done through the bus dashboard or hotkeys Challenging driving through narrow streets Multiple districts with different house- and road layouts as well as modeling Penalities for not driving properly or crashing Events such as stuck doors, drunk passengers, emergency vehicles, etc. Dynamic weatherCons Graphics and modeling are mediocre Multiplayer driving is basically single player instances in a shared company (i.e. you can not see the other players in game) Some bugs such as indicators on cars, suddenly stopping cars, etc Idle chatter of the passengers are somewhat repetitive Low FPS ConclusionYou will want to put on a bus driver hat when playing this game and you also want seek out teraphy for your ever escalating case of road rage - of which this game will most certainly not improve.So if you are into simulators you will love the attention to details this game provides and is defintely worth picking up.

												Bus Simulator 16.The concept is great. Being a bus driver without the hassle of a real one or OMSI 1/2 :p. The game mechanics are working well. Tilting the bus, opening and closing the doors, turning the engine on and off, several switches you can use and of course, 'free' walking. I like to walk through my bus and look at the bloody passangers that block the door >:D.Pros: Fun gameplay Easy to use, but still a lot of buttons to press :D Random events Sounds are okay MAN buses! :)Cons: Engine isn't very well optimised. Getting 30-40 FPS on HIGH with an i5 4670k and GTX 980 4GB TRANSLATIONS!!11!1!1!!, the Dutch language in this game is horrible. Some strings are correct, but 3/4 of it is incorrect. This buggers me a lot. "

What's to like about it?Bus Simulator 16 does exactly what it says in the title (that's always a good start)!  You start out with a simple route and basic vehicle, and you drive the route to collect fares, keep to a timetable, avoid accidents and (hopefully) make a profit.  When you have enough money, you can hire new drivers, buy new vehicles and drive new routes too.  This is a true simulator (not necessarily a 'fun' game) so will likely feel a bit dry for anyone looking for heaps of excitement!Whether you enjoy this simulator or not will come down to how well you treat the simulation.  If you ignore kerbs, corners and road positioning, you can hare from stop to stop and then it's done - boring.  However, if you play it as a trainee driver and use your mirrors to make perfect corners without clipping kerbs or hitting anything, (ie a bit of real-life stuff), then you will get much more challenge and simulation experience out of the game.  A wheel is recommended for the driving, and there is a full set of cockpit controls that you can click on in 3D view (a little like Train Simulator) or you can use button shortcuts instead.  I've driven several buses and coaches and I have to say the handling of the buses in-game isn't bad at all.  Some things are simulated perfectly, like mirrors and cornering (and reversing into your garage if you're feeling particularly cocky)!  This is as real as it gets and Bus Simulator 16 nails it perfectly.  Wheels on a bus or coach are a few feet behind the driver, so you must drive out into the junction straight before you can begin the steer.  Unlike a car, steering is not a single arm-wrench of the wheel and skid around that corner (pity)!  It's a nouanced set of movements (steer the front, straighten, steer again for rear wheels) that is difficult at first, but it's very true to life.  This is what the game does exceptionally well.  In reality, overall steering tends to be a little lighter and easier than is represented by the game, with only slight steer giving quite a turn, but the game wanted more steering than I would usually expect.  That could be that I don't have my in-game wheel settings balanced correctly though.Talking of wheels, many are supported but do check the forums as some people are having a few problems.  The newer Logitech 920 isn't currently working properly (the devs are looking at it).  As for older wheels like the Logitech G25 and 27, they do work after some fiddling.  It entails downloading Logitech's newest driver which no longer supports the G25/27 (nice one Logitech in forcing obsolescence in £200+ game controllers) and taking from the new drivers a DLL file and adding it to the game (all explained in the game forums), then reinstalling an older G25/27 supporting driver.  A nuisance, but doable.Anything not so good?The graphics are a bit basic for today's PCs, though they're not necessarily so important as the game mechanics are in a simulation title.  There is ONLY right-hand driving, which sucks for anyone in a left-hand drive country because this game actually makes quite a neat training aid.  The overall vehicle handling and steering response (particularly on straight roads) tends to be a little too heavy (steering of these vehicles is typically very light).  Oh, and there is no driver customisation which is a minor point, but being able to customise features, skin-tone and gender could have been a neat addition.  That's nit-picking though.Will you like it?If you're looking for a pure simulator title, then this is a good place to start.  It offers everything you need in setting up and driving basic bus routes and is actually good enough as a training aid for driving any long, non-articulated vehicle in managing corners well (all mirrors are recreated perfectly).  However, if you're looking for more of a 'game' experience, it might be a title you won't enjoy so much.			"

												IT'S AN OMSI 2 FOR NOOBS (and that's a good thing)I was always interested in the various bus simulators, but always found the learning curve to be too steep. Games like OMSI 2 while great, are too insanely detailed for their own good, putting off someone like myself from really giving it a chance.ETS2/ATS on the otherhand proved to me that you can make a accessible simulator while keeping it just deep enough to please the hardcore. I simply wanted a bus simulator that followed the ETS2 mold and Bus Simulator 2016 is a great first step at that.PROS:- Easy to pick up and play. It comes with a nice tutorial for first timers.- The city feels alive and lived in. There are a variety of passengers (including drunk and wheel chair bound patrons).- The added business simulation element gives you incentive to continue and improve your driving skills as it directly effects your bottom line.- Ability to easily create and drive routes. A simple 5 stop route to a monster 50 stop route is possible.- You can buy and customize your buses with decals, earn extra money by placing ads, and hire drivers to drive them.- Relatively stable performance. Did not crash once (unlike a certain other game).- Supports the Thrustmaster TX 458 Italia (by customizing the controls).CONS:- No TrackIR support (the mouse is used)- Needs more optimization- No real multiplayer to speak of (driving with friends).- The AI traffic lacks other buses. It would be nice to see your competitors as well as your own buses running the same streets as it currently feels like you are the only bus driver in town.- No penalty for arriving too early for your next stop. I've finished my route as early as 8 minutes without penalty. **Perhaps this is something that is unlocked later in game?			"

												Solid Bus driving Simulator. Altough there is room for optimization I already had roughly two hours of fun with this game. It has decent graphics (for a simulator) and the controls work very well when you got used to the bus. I also like the licenced MAN Busses and that they got Mod support which is very nice. Can't wait to play this in multiplayer with friends to set up our own company ! :D Totally recommended for people in need of a nice and calming game for afterwork sessions :)			"

Embrace the MundaneIt's no secret that I've got a soft spot for what some might cruelly call the ""mundane simulator""I've trucked and farmed my way through many a simulator title and I've loved them all.When I'm gaming I don't really discriminate between genres, being a gun toting super hero is fun but sometimes I just want to do something different, something normal that I'll probably never to get experience in my own ""real life"" something alternative but ""mundane"".I've come to terms with the fact that I'm firmly stuck in my rut in life, I'm never likely to be a truck driver or a farmer but these simulator games give you a chance to get a feeling of what it might be like, they give you a chance to experience a different life.It's the ultimate reality based escapism and it can definitely be a lot more fun than it sounds.So I've hauled cargo across Europe, I've trucked around the USA and I've farmed until the cows came home but I've never been a bus driver.Today we're going to fix that!Simple LifeLike a lot of jobs, on the surface it sounds pretty simple, I mean driving a bus, how hard could it be?You get to sit down all day and cruise around in a big circle, stopping every few minutes along the way.It doesn't sound too difficult does it?Your cargo even unloads itself!Ahhh to be a bus driver, that'd be a good life.With this mind I fired up Bus Simulator 16 ready for some hard core bus based business but I soon learned that being a bus driver isn't just about driving a bus, there's a wealth of bells and whistles that go along with the job that complicate things, which is just as well because it adds a little depth to what would other whys be a pretty simple driving game with some pretty bland scenery, but we'll get onto that later.The Wheels on the Bus...First the driving mechanic, a pretty important part of any game which involves driving and has the word ""simulator"" in the title.You'll have access to six different buses in the base game (who knows what DLC might bring) but for the most part this variety is purely cosmetic, the handling between each ""flavour"" of bus feels identical and the driving experience is more arcade than simulator.Speed and handling feel a little off (not that I've ever driven a bus, but I've been a passenger on a few) and the ride itself always feels disconnected from the road, it's too smooth and floaty, there's no rumble of an uneven road surface, no potholes to avoid (or deliberately drive over to annoy the passengers). The wheels on the bus might go round and round but there's no real sense that they're in contact with the road.This makes the driving part of Bus Simulator 16 a flat experience and that's a real shame.The Buttons on the BusWhilst the actual driving physics are pretty basic  there are still plenty of interactions with the vehicle to put some ticks in the simulation box.You get to turn the key to start your engine, flick the switches to put on the various lights both inside and outside the cab.There are buttons to raise and lower the bus and you even have a heater you can play with.The simulation doesn't restrict you to sitting in the driver seat either, if you feel the need you can always pull over and get out to stretch your legs (or stare unnervingly at your passengers who pretend not to notice).Tickets Please!Bus Simulator 16 isn't just about driving a bus around, there are plenty of other things you'll need to take care of too.Some passengers will need to buy a ticket from you, sounds straight forward right?but there are different ticket types, single, student, weekly, etc.  and do you think they'll have the correct change?Of course not!So you'll be working the ticket machine, selecting the ticket type and duration, printing out the tickets and calculating the correct change in your head all whilst you keep one eye on the clock.There's a time table to stick to and everyone hates it if the bus is late. Pesky PassengersIt's not just the ticket sales which slow down the turnaround time either, some passengers might require extra help, a person in a wheelchair for example will need you to vacate the drivers' seat and put down the ramp for them to board the bus, of course you'll need to stow the ramp away again before you head off.There's also a high probability that the disabled passenger will actually want to get off your bus again at some point, that'll mean you've got another ramp based delay to look forward to as you drive the route.The passengers don't even leave you alone when they've finally paid up and sat in their seats either. You'll be happily driving along, trying to make time back up on your route when you'll hear a moaning voice echo along the bus, ""I'm too hot"" or ""It's too cold in here, can you do something about the temperature?"".... ughhh, so now you're having to mess around with the air con. whilst keeping an eye on the sat nav. and another on the road. You wouldn't want to crash or run down a pedestrian, that might hurt your profit margin (and be bad for whoever you hit of course).Bus Mechanic 16So you herd the cattle (Sorry, passengers) onto the bus and manage not to freeze them, cook them or crash them into anything but there are still other things which can delay you.Even if the traffic is clear, the passengers are behaving and the traffic lights are green things can still go wrong.The bus itself can work against you, there can be mechanical issues which require your attention.For example the doors could become jammed and your cargo (sorry, passengers) are a fickle bunch and don't seem to like the thrill of being chauffeured around with the doors wide open, they worry about silly little things like falling to their death.You can pull over and fix these mechanical annoyances but it all takes time... time you'll need to make up on the road if you don't want to be late.Like the Back End of a Bus!Visually the game is a little disappointing, it's not ugly but the textures are fairly plain.Don't go into this expecting photo realism, or even  Truck Simulator quality graphics or you'll be disappointed by the view.Even at the highest settings the view distance on your rear view mirror is surprisingly low. You're constantly followed by what looks like really thick white fog pursuing you along the city streets, it's kinda scary really (Have you ever seen the Stephen King movie ""The Mist""?).You're not just restricted to driving around one district either, as you progress in the game you'll be able to unlock 4 more to keep things interesting (the scary ""mirror fog"" will follow you to these districts too!)One Route to Rule Them AllIn addition to all the thrills of driving a big old bus around there's also a management simulation aspect to Bus Sim 16.Keeping your passengers happy and the fares rolling in is good for company profits and that's good for you because you own the company.You can tweak the look and colour of your buses and cover them in adverts to bring in some extra revenue.You'll be setting up bus routes and hiring drivers to trundle along them all in the name of profit, profit which you can then re-invest in more buses and more drivers.End of the LineBus Simulator 16 is an interesting title and whilst it can be fun there's no denying that it lacks a little polish.This is a niche game, it's not going to be for everyone, but if you're looking to try something a little different and think the life of a virtual bus driver might be for you then that's an itch this game will happily scratch.Like the review and want to see more?

												Bus Simulator 16 played using a Driving Force GT steeringwheel.BS16 is a surprise for me. I have little affinity with public transport if it isn't screaming along on a set of rails pulling a metric crapton of cargo-carriages. Another consideration is that I didn't think that coming to a stop at every lamppost would be fun.But BS16 takes the concept of driving something bulky through crowded streets and makes a potentially aggrivating activity a fun and enjoyable thing to do. The driving takes place in a colorful, full featured city that's brought alive by lots of traffic and pedastrians on the sidewalks. In my hours played already, I have never been in the 'last person on earth doing a public service job' situation many simulators tend to put the player in.The busses come in several flavors and are relatively easy to drive. There's little difference between them as they all have to same start up routine, the same transmission times, the same speeds, the same turn-radius and the same stupid ability to start driving backwards when you apply the brakes. (Errata: A setting in the options vaguely called 'drive aids' corrects that.)As a busdriver, you transport people along a busline that's initially set, but after a short while, you can erase that baby's first busline and construct your own lines, which you can also share online for other people to drive. When other people drive your shared line, you get paid.You sell tickets to people and have to give them correct change if they don't pay with ready money. Sadly, the amount of money they use to pay is not varied enough so that after a few stops you start giving people their change with your eyes closed. So, and idea that was initially fun, becomes a tedious chore due to how limited they made it.Passengers are interactive. A disabled person in wheelchair might need your help embarking or disembarking, an absent minded person might need to be made aware that you can't close the doors if he doesn't move further into the bus. The passengers have silly conversations that regularly make me laugh. One such an exchange really had me in stiches as a young woman rung up her mother on her cellphone to loudly exclaim that she was finally pregnant followed by 'No, I'm not at home, I'm in a bus!'.At first, I struggled with operating my bus. I kept clipping the curb, stepped on the brakes too heavy, stepped on the brakes too lightly, steered too little or steered too much and generally was allover the place. If the game wasn't so colorful, or if the game wasn't so alive with everything that's going on, I wouldn't have stuck with it as I did. After a while, it clicked and I was doing the rounds as if I had never done anything but drive busses all of my life. As I gained skill, my enjoyment of the game grew accordingly.As the manager of a bussing company, you can decorate your busses, get advertizement contracts, create buslines, hire and fire drivers and amass mountains of money. You advance your company's reach and reputation at a steady pace and you get a good feel of accomplishment out of it. Within the first few hours of play you're admiring your budding fleet of busses, see the map get filled by your buslines and smile as the game shows you a pop-up that someone has driven one of your shared lines which made a nice amount of cash.The traffic AI needs a good look-over however. It's downright more stupid than a bag of hammers in a glass-factory. When they do what they're supposed to do, it's fine and it makes the city-driving all the more realistic. But they more often do the stupid and annoy you by making sure that your bottomline is wrecked by financial setbacks you can't avoid. Pedastrians aren't much better, prone to start crossing the road when you're manouvring to rounda corner. That results in a 'big accident' that immedeately ends your run. When that happens near the end of a 30minute drive, there's little reason to smile. I don't mind failing because I made a mistake. I do mind failing because the AI is as stupid as the developer tasked with developing with the AI.Using a steeringwheel with forcefeedback and a 900degree turn is in my opinion a must. It really adds that extra like adding wheelturn resistance, which simulates that awesome 'I'm steering a huge and bulky vehicle' experience. The 900degrees wheelturn also removes the twitch-steering you get with the keyboard or a controller; making the turning more ponderous. The difference is really between night and day and heightens the immersion greatly.If the entire package wasn't so colorful, if the streets were scarcely populated, if the management layer would've been treadbare, if the passengers were badly animated cardboard cut outs, then the things like the busses all handling the same and the AI being terminally stupid would make BS16 just another 'german simulator with nothing to live for'.As it stands however, BS16 is saved by the attention to detail and many other things that really makes me feel that I'm a busdriver doing the rounds in a believable, albeit none existant, european city.Thumbs up then. If the developers keep working on this title and keep bettering it, then this game could become a benchmark for city-driving simulators. It's halfway to greatness already and I wholeheartedly recommend you this title.			"

												Got the T500RS and this game is a lot of fun with it.  Shame there is no trackir support but you can change the field of view as a driver to see both mirrors and can set keys on the wheel to look left or right which is easy enough to get used to!If you're looking for something different then I'd definitely recommend this			"

But the modding community wil help with usefull mods aswel, just give it time.			"

												This game actually suprised me, here's why:+ First bus simulator to allow making your own bus company+ Design bus liveries for your company+ You can make your own routes which is new(all three of those aspects should be first in bus sim: I've played Bus & Cablecar Simulator, Bus Driver, Bus Simulator, City Bus Simulator, Bus Simulator 2012, Citybus München, OMSI 1 & OMSI 2).+ Steam workshop support (I already saw one bus there, unfortunately it's camera is quite bad)- No physics at all (if you've played BCCS, CBS, BS12, Farming sim series then you know what to expect)+/- Doesn't reach the details of OMSI but I imagine that is what more casual players prefer- Issues with graphics- Those non-licensed buses are ugly. MAN's are okay.These are my thoughts after playing for 3h.			"

												deplorable....how a game can be this bad in 2016 is beyond me....every other simulator in this price range, and some for a few dollars more (ATS2, ETS, TS2017, Farming Sim 2017) are FAR superior in graphics, dynamics and mechanics. Not to mention there have been stability issues since day 1...I still thought it would be better than it is. Literally do not understand what you are paying for - this rivals free sim games you find on addictinggames.com.Wish you could return it - would gladly""undownload & delete"" for a refund.			"

												This game sits between games like ETS 2 and Omsi 2. Like ETS 2 the world is open and explorable, and there is a managment part where you run your company. Unlike Omsi 2 the game actually looks good and runs well, though the details of each bus are nowhere near as involved. It /is/ a simulator, you have to start the bus, use indicators, open doors, all by either clicking on items on the screen, using the keyboard or mapping them to controller buttons. While its somewhat arcadey there is a learning curve but its enjoyable discovering how the bus works and how you need to use it in the world. The developers seem to be listening and working hard to update most of the complaints they've recieved. For example the orientation of the gps map or auto turn off of indicators when you straighten out the steering wheel. The game play is smooth, I haven't quantified the framerates but it doesn't stutter or go slowly unlike Omsi 2 which is notorious for doing that even on massive high end systems. The sound quality is high, though somewhat generic. The only complaint I have is how harsh some of the penalties are. Hit a pedestrian? Game stops and you have to start the scenario over, even if it happens as your pulling into your garage. Accidents are very costly, as are speeding fines. All well and good for sim realism I guess but annoying. Finally, the game is fairly easy to use with my G27 steering set up, though I did have to futz a little with the settings to get things nice. Again, more like ETS 2 in that and a hell of a lot better than Omsi 2. Overall I give it four and a half out of five stars.A pleasant and thoughtful game that keeps your attention and is challanging enough not to bore you easily but not so hard your wondering why the hell you wasted money on it (yes I'm looking at you Omsi).System specs: 4790K i7, Gigabyte 980ti G1, 16 gigs Crucial memory.

Posted: March 5, 2016
												UPDATED (ALMOST 1year after release update)Sadly, not much changed in a year. Optimization is still requested by many which implies they havent dealt seriously with the problem. Only 2 DLC have been released and I see them as pure money grabber. They are not offering anything new than buses but those buses look exactly the same as the ones already ingame. The only difference is that they are branded MAN or Mercedes-Benz which (due to having to pay the right to the brands) are ridiculously expensive for the amount of content (and the usefulness of the said content has still to be proven).  In short, this game as still a long way to go. It does work but its not incredible performances and I'm afraid that those devs will follow the wrong path taken by Giants Software (farming simulator franchise) and will soon abandon this game to release a new one called Bus Simulator 18 which will be same engine, little difference in content but still priced the same. I hope I'm wrong, I cross my fingers for this... Still a positive review  but it could change after some time.ORIGINAL REVIEWAs promised, here is my review of the bus simulator  16. I played for nearly 8h and streamed it the whole time.While this is true the game is not optimized at all and this could make it impossible to play for some people, this game is far from the 45-50% rating it received on release. I'm glad it's back to 60% as I'm writing this review and I believe it could deserve to be a little higher like 70-75% because the game itself isn't bad. The devs just have a very hard time to optimize it and they are working on it very hard. I cross my fingers they release a fix quickly. But don't be fooled by those bad reviews. Almost none of those rate the game for what it is, they are just bad reviews of angry players not able to launch the game and not patient enough to give the devs a chance to release a fix.This game is not OMSI 2! If you seek for an incrediblely detailed bus simulator, don't buy. This game is more arcadish. If I had to compare it to other games, I would say it's like if OMSI 2 and Cities in Motion had a baby together. You have the management part of Cities in Motion (you create bus routes, assign drivers and busses to them, make sure they are giving positive income, etc). And with that you have the driving part of OMSI 2 (you drive buses, interact with passengers, deal with traffic, etc). You can interact with buttons in cockpit view. I was surprised there was so much to interact with in fact. So while it's not OMSI 2, it's still not a lazy game where you only accelerate/decelerate/left/right and nothing else. The driving is not the most realistic one but still very fun and it works very well with G27. Just a bit hard to set it up on first time but pretty fine after some gaming time.The multiplayer is a nice add considering lot of driving games never have one. Sadly, it's not a real multi. As you cannot see your drivers (AI) on the road, well you cannot see other players aswell in multi. It's more like if other players were replacing the AI so they are supposedly better drivers than AI but the mechanism behind is exactly the same. Very disappointed by this but I salute the effort. SCS (Euro and American Truck Simulator dev) never bothered trying to add a multi while players are hardly requesting it. StillAlive has work to do to catch on SCS but at least they tried. Let's give them a chance to improve. SCS didn't become a great truck sim developer in one day after all. ;)Only down side of the game are the graphics. They are not stunning at all and the game is more laggy than GTA V (I run it almost at ultra while I can barely run the bus sim at  medium with a poor 20FPS). Optimization is what hurts this game right now. As I said, I cross fingers the devs fix that soon. It's really annoying to have 30-45 second loading screen on launch and I'm lucky, some players must wait 4-5 minutes! So yes, if you are not patient to wait for a fix, don't buy or request a refund. But please, this game doesn't deserve so much bad reviews just because those devs are not experienced enough and have a little struggle optimizing their game. From a huge studio, I would have not forgiven such a mess with optimization, but for StillAlive, I'm ready to give them some time. I hope they will make good use of it.			"

												After playing the game for about three hours I have more con's then pro's on my list. There for I can not recommend this game.Pro's:- Ticket system. (Fairly similar to the one in OMSI 2. This one is easier to use tho.- Graphics are somewhere between 'decent' and 'ok'. Definitely an upgrade from OMSI but, at the same time kinda cartoonish (arcade) - It recognized my wheel and pedals even before I got in the main menu. Really easy to bind all the keys etc.-It's more stable than OMSI 2.----Con's:- Seriously not well optimized and laggy. When I started the game it had an incredible amount of lag. My fps went from 35 to 21, up again sometimes down to 10/15. + I have to mention when I played about an hour I had a steady 30/40 fps on medium quality. But the lag is really annoying.- Busses have absolutely no physics whatsoever. When you drive a bus in OMSI you actually have the feeling you are driving a bus and it's full weight. And you have to look in your mirrors with every turn and corner. While the busses in this game look ok, they have none of that. Which is also one of the reasons in my opinion this feels more like an arcade game than a simulator.- There is no actual sky(?) As in blue with clouds etc + the city feels lifeless.So overall maybe a 5 outta 10. If you want a decent bus *simulator* invest some time and money in OMSI 2. If your looking for an arcade bus driving game, get this one.			"

												Plain and simple, this is the bus driving game I've been waiting for. What gets me excited about playing this game are the little things that do a lot to the immersion: Passengers running late, waiving at you in hopes you won't take off without them; traffic that doesn't constantly crash into you or each other but yield when you indicate that you are about to set off; jammed doors or passengers blocking doors from closing; handicapped passengers in need of a ramp; events like dynamic construction sites or an ambulance with wailing sirens, etc.. Further, Bus Simulator 16 gives you incentives to drive safely as you gain more reputation with your passengers when you do not drive like a maniac. You can if you want to, but it will hurt the rate of your progression (and your economy):Like Euro Truck Simulator 2, Bus Simulator 16 additionally has a management simulation mechanic which lets you buy new busses, hire drivers to generate additional revenue, customize your vehicles and even create all the routes on your own. These things (including new districts) are unlocked step by step as your reputation grows. If you have played other public transportation simulators before then you quickly learn the controls. The tutorial is also a good addition in explaining all the important elements. Handling and getting the bus to move is easier in Bus Simulator 16 than for example OMSI 2. Therefore, hardcore OMSI fans might get a little dissatisfied as mastering your vehicle is way simpler.The five available districs are rich in variety and the city is actually bigger than it seems when looking at the map. Unfortunately, the tool for creating routes does not give you any degree of freedom when it comes to choosing which road you want to use, resulting in odd and annoying routing in some cases.Further, and despite Bus Simulator 16 being neatly polished for a simulation game, it is quite heavy on performance. So if you do not have a very 'potent' computer you might get really poor framerates.Nonetheless, this game got me motivated and hooked right from the start. I hope for additional features for the route creation tool and performance improvements but apart from that I consider my 25 bucks well spent.			"

												It's an awesome, very approachable game! Granted you will need a higher end PC to play this at it's full potental. Before you pass this off as a bad game, be sure to take note that there are more postive than negative reviews. Most of the negative reviews are regarding performance issues due to them most likely having lower-end PCs. I say give it a try! If you don't like it, there is always Steam Refund.			"

												Spending a lot of time with Farming- and Eurotrucksimulator, I gave this a try - and it actually is a surprisingly interesting and nicely detailed game. The simulation aspect is very well done, you can turn every switch and even manually sell tickets. The excellent tutorial will introduce you easily to all aspects to the game.  While the graphics are overall not up to the standards of the aforementioned titles, the gameworld was designed with great attention to detail. A good example are the sometimes quite silly conversations of your passengers. It´s also fun to just leave the vehicle and explore the city on foot (which reminds me a lot of Vienna, for some reason). Also a big positive is the quite fleshed out management part, where you can plan new routes, customize vehicles and hire drivers. I´m looking forward to what the mod-community is going to deliver, this game really has potential.If you´re into simulation games and don´t insist on the latest flashy high-end graphics, I would definitely recommend this. Performance issues have also been solved for me with the latest patch, everything is running smooth.			"

												Bus simulator can be frustrating at times due to the large amount of menus and buttons need to learn to drive a bus. However, once you get a handle for driving the bus it becomes a rather enjoyable experience. The city is expansive and rather enjoyable to explore.			"

												I don't know why I bought this. I don't know why I keep playing it either. I mean... it's bad. It's really bad. It's glitchy. Performance is... awful. Yet I keep playing it.If you're looking for a good game, this isn't it. Euro Truck Simulator is better. But there's something there beneath the glitches and the terrible performance.Either something about this game is good, or I'm really much more stupid than I thought I was.Probably a bit of both.

Compared to previous games it seems like it is more about being the actual bus driver driving the bus (dealing with people and time, etc) rather than just being a bus that moves around the city. The voice acting made my day, put a smile on my face during a stressful day at work.			"

												So I've been playing this game for a few hours and I was super excited when I saw the game. I love these type of games so what could be wrong? Well I'm sure for some there is plenty wrong but I only have one issue with this game. One really big issue and that is the lag. During driving the game will just slow down and driving becomes annoying in that moment as it can easily go wrong. I often have it at crossings so I can't even hit the brake properly if needed. I've tried adjusting the settings and it's on the lowest graphics setting now and it still lags. So is it my laptop? I would think not since I can play recently released games just fine on high settings without any lag. Plus my laptop is fairly new and bought for gaming purposes to begin with. It's the game itself that just has it. I can sort of live with it for an hour or two of game time every day or so but no more then that because the lagging is just majorly annoying and I do hope this gets fixed soon. Other then that I quite enjoy the game. It's a nice concept and the game offers a bit of a challenge so thats nice aswell. The only other comment I could have about it is maybe allow us to decide wether we want to be a male or female bus driver and maybe be able to edit uniforms? It's something small that I think would be a nice edit to the game but thats just a small idea. So in a nutshell once they fix this lag I say get the game. If it continues and you want to try the game buy it on sale but not for the full price.			"

												The game is a Bus Simulator, it does a good job at simulating a bus driver.  It is a very technical game in the fact that you need to work all the parts of the bus, there is very little automation.  I believe this is what makes it a good simulator game.  Graphics are pretty clean, city is quite large (I drove around a good portion of the city just to check it out), and it is quite enjoyable.At first I had an error trying to run the game, but that was because it was attempting to use my Intel Graphics rather than my NVIDIA Graphics, couple of quick fixes and it was all set.  For anyone having trouble on a laptop make sure you check to see which card it is running on.NVIDIA GeForce GT 750MIntel i7 2.3GHzRam: 16GB			"

												I usually write an in-depth review on the games I play, but I'll write a quick ""first-impression"". The game is on sale at bundlestars and I figured why not.1) Graphics - their not terrible, but they could be better. The mirrors are no where near the quality of Euro Truck - they do provide extra info when driving (visually), but lack in representing it properly. I have NOT EXPERIENCED LAG ISSUES THUS FAR WITH FRAMERATES (which is good too). The mirrors are a big part of the experience (for me anyway). The right mirror needs a little more emphasis or maybe just fix it to the top right of the screen? Add an option for it? (Bang up job with the options in the game - turning cashier on and off is amazing). 2)Details - from cashier, to options, to heat, to bus tilting, to ramps, to people running late, to getting on and off your bus to fix doors etc... There here definitely. You can customize your bus and put adds on them for extra revenue. Annoyances (such as cashier-ing) can be turned off. It's only annoying as you cannot select individual buttons with the controller and must use the mouse. The dialogue is very cool and promotes positive citizens. Very nice to hear productive dialogue rather than dramatic. The turn signal even turns off after taking a turn. This is cool!3)Driving - No where near Euro Truck standards as it feels blocky. Driving is okay for the most part and the controls can be customized to your liking (which is a huge benefit). Lots of room for improvement here. Angles feel sharp and awkward at times, space margins don't feel right in First Person.4)Environment - It is pretty cool to drive a big vehicle in a busy city with pedestrians and cars. The crashes aren't the most details or greatest, but the game does note your driving habits (i.e speeding tickets or running red lights). Watching the emergency vehicles pop up makes me want an emergency driving simulator. I would love to be put in some tight situations... i.e certain stops have certain turns which make them challenging (but fun)!5) AI - The AI getting in and out of the bus is not smooth. There are a lot of waiting/pausing/collisions. Likewise with the traffic, cars will randomly stop in intersections or when you are around them. There isn't much a variable concerning how cars drive either than ""stock"" or very regular. Would be nice with some curveballs thrown in. 6) UI is quite friendly and easy to use. Bus routes cannot be set up manually as they are already fixed on the map. The player can see how much each route makes after a shift, but cannot see it from the main menu. I sank two hours into it instantly. I like the options given and the premise of the game, but I feel a lot more can be done to make this game better. Some will like it for what it is as there is not much competition regarding bus sims. Others will really hate the driving physics. I'll recommend it - with caution though! Do your homework as I think it's only worth a purchase on a major sale!			"

												I love the concept, but the game feels very unpolished to me. OMSI 2 is a tad expensive and I heard the controls for it were a nightmare. So I settled for this. Initally I really like what I saw! But 19 hours later I've seen all I need to see. Vehicle handling is a joke, feels like your trying to taxi an airplane down the street for ♥♥♥♥ sake, cornering is even worse (even though the buses have 4-wheel steering) The traffic AI is frustrating to say the least, the game has incredibly poor optimization (25-30FPS on a PC that can run most AAA titles well above 60FPS) and the sounds! Damn! The bus sounds like a dying vacuum cleaner when your driving (although it sounds normal at idle) No chase view was rather annoying too like come on I want to see my bus! Not just the side of it! So all in all these game didn't do it for me. Just seems too rough around the edges still.			"

												Eeeeh... it's FINE. The driving part of the game is FINE, nothing amazing, but perfectly servicable. My major complaint is that the buses simply don't feel weighty, but that's something I can live with.The UI you see between routes is really pretty and levelling-up feels rewarding. Oh yeah, there's levelling and unlocking and progression. If you like that, great, I'd personally just prefer to have everything unlocked from the start, but that's because I tend to play games like these when I want to play something that doesn't require a whole lot of thinking. Still, you unlock things fairly quickly so it's fine. All in all, I don't know about whether other bus simulation games are better than this, so I can't say which one you should get, but for this one, I can say it's FINE.			"

												I honestly don’t know should I recommend this game or not.First of all, it’s buggy to the core. I had no stability issues, yet freezes haunt the game (for me decreasing he drawing distance from 300 to 250 meters helped, but c’mon). The routing is glitchy, the game tends to suddenly and unlogically change your route, and I was already being fined for unscheduled stopping and skipping the same stop at the same time.Then, the visuals — they’ll remind you of 2005, and not of the best of the time. Basically, it looks and feels almost like SCS's early Bus Driver.On the other hand, somehow it works. Random event are here, you have to fix things on the go and deal with a troublemaker from time to time, traffic isn’t rediculous like in OMSI 2, and the buses have at least all the everyday life related controls, and you should actually use them. That makes the game much more interesting and challenging then you can expect.The version of the game is 0.0.8~ at the moment of wrinting this review (12/26 2016), so I guess the game can be considered the early access. The developers seem to listen to the community and at least try to make it better.The only worthy competitor at the time is the already mentioned OMSI 2, and BS16 is much more accessible, visually appealing, and with much more sensible price tag. On the other hand, OMSI is the much deeper simulation experience. So if you always wanted to get in the bus driver’s seat, get the BS16 on sale — it’s a good starting poing. "

												Isn't perfect but still amazing. This will be quite long so if you dont want to read heres everything summed up in less detail: Great game, Some bugs, Alot of potention, 7.5/10 over all. Now for the long♥♥♥♥♥♥I've been playing this game for 10 hours and I've fallen in love with it so far. It hasn't crashed for me and I've had no problems but this won't run well on a potato pc. Sadly theres no track ir support and keyboard controlls are a bit dodgy from my experience but are great on my steering wheel. You start off with a single bus and a single district and you need to drive and plan routes until you recive another bus and then you can hire a driver, Eventually, you'll earn enough money to buy a driver and you won't have to do all the work yourself earing you money every time you do a route yourself. When you unlock all buses and districts then it might become a bit boring (I haven't reached that level yet so i won't talk about it alot.) but there might be some challenges or something or you can try multiplayer. Theres some random events expanding from upset passengers, stuck doors, drunk passengers and extending the ramp for wheel chair passengers. Heres are some things i like and think are good and bad for the game. Pros: +A nice looking, freely accessible city with 5 realistic districts+Workshop support+Various challenges (Rush hour, Construction etc.)+Random conversations with the passengers+Simple GPS+Driving the bus feels realisticCons:-No TrackIR-Easy to go bankrupt.-Ads & Decals sometimes look a bit stupid on the buses.-Some bugs.

												At this moment i been playing the game for 3 hours. The first impressions are nice. You take over the bus company from a old man who is gonna retire. Up to you to build out the company and keep it healthy while you drive around in busses yourself as well.I really like how they put in little details with the passengers. In other bus simulators they are rather static and only react to certain things when you mess up. In Bus Simulator 16 your passengers talk with others so you can hear the conversations at times, they play around with their phone, checking for messages or playing games on it. But not for the whole ride, its not a animation that keeps playing till they leave the bus. Pedestrians also feel more alive, when they cross a street and a car is getting close they start to run. Emergency vehicles now also make their way trough the traffic, passing by when someone is standing still. A huge improvement over the others where they tend to stay behind cars and waiting in line till its their turn. They also drive trough the red light so you have make sure you let them go first when you hear the sirens.Another great thing are random events like maintenance to the road that makes you have to take a detour, problems with the bus you need to fix and you even get passengers in wheelchairs that you actually have to help with the ramp depending on what bus you are controlling. Don't forget this cause me and others already didn't notice them and drove off just to get the message i forgot a passenger.There are also some minor things. If you are a die hard simmer then this game might be a bit to arcady for you. Unlike it's competition you don't need to remember a lot of buttons and manage all aspects of the bus to make sure the temperature and such is good enough.This makes it easyer for beginners to get into or those who like driving a bus but find the competition to hard, but for those who are looking for the next big bus simulator this might be a disapointment.There are also some optimization issues going on, when you read the negative reviews you will see a few of them. I personally haven't had the game crash on me once, nor having any bug showing up ingame. Though the game could use some optimzation, i first thought it was my pc but reading the negative reviews it is the game appearantly. Though i lower my range of view and that helped alot with the fps drops.There are also long loading screens, however once it loaded the city it has loaded everything so when you unlocked the city you can drive around without any issues.There is also a multiplayer aspect though that means you can get a friend drive routes for your company and earn money for your company. Sadly you can't see them driving around in the same world. I hope they will add this cause that would be great. The good:+ Create your own routes+ Passengers feel more alive then before+ Nice details in behavior from emergency vehicles, pedestrians and passengers+ Random eventsThe minor:- Perhaps to arcady for the die hard simmers- Could use a bit more optimization (though it isn't to bad)- No other players in your world when playing the multiplayerA quick look at Bus Simulator 16: Quick look at Bus Simulator 16 "

												It has almost everything I was looking for in a Bus driving simulation game out of the box.Pros:+ easy controls: every switch on the bus panel is highlighted when holding RMB+ big living city: every car and pedestrian around you is simulated+ you can walk around in the city, inside your bus and drink a virtual cup of coffee+ believable passenger behaviour: mumbling, complaining, etc+ cashier mode: you do the math, but keep at eye on the clock, because it's ticking for the next stop+ easier to start with than OMSI+ manage your own bus company, hire drivers, buy more buses, create routes+ company progress, leveling & unlockable buses, decals, advertisements, city districts+ good steering wheel support+ modding perspective: custom buses, customizable city, textures, decalsCons:- performance. High graphic settings are laggish for me now, I have to play on medium with anti-aliasing and it runs well.- no button for centering the camera view, it would come in handy when using a steering wheel- some people have reported that keyboard & mouse controls are not that great (but I am using a steering wheel anyway)Some surprising positive moments from the game:1. I created a new route and was driving it. I missed a turn and didn't notice that for a minute, heard passengers saying something like ""- Are you sure we are on the right bus? - Yes, I checked the map, it is the shortest route"". Then I looked at the map and realized I took the wrong turn and GPS was showing me that I should make a very long detour I couldn't do in time anyway. So I turned around in a nearest convenient place (they should have fined me for that though), but I made it in time to the next bus stop.2. Invalid passengers, when they ask for help, you have to get out of the bus and pull the ramp for them to get into the bus.3. An ambulance drove the street on my lane, I had to turn a little more to the right to give way. I haven't seen this kind of thing in other games.I wish accidents were more realistic, not just fining the player, but with all serious consequences like in the real world.I am still not sure if creating custom city maps is possible with the current modding tools. Only customizing the existing one is allowed, afaik.I have a feeling this game should have been delayed a little bit more. In perspective, this game can make the best bus simulator once all performance / stability problems are fixed. I'm really enjoying the game so far.			"

												This is a good simulator though. Many options and possiblities. Its more casual than OMSI, but I like that. Its about driving the bus and keeping the costumers happy. This game gets an 8/10, it was a 10 if the steering mechanics are better. If you drive a long bus you see the bus shaking in the mirror. Thats probably better when you have a joystick or steer, but when using a keyboard it is (really) unrealistic.			"

												I'm no expert in the ""Simulator"" genre by any means, but Bus Simulator 16 employs some pretty addicting mechanics, which was unexpected to say the least. Trying to land *perfectly* on the parking space, getting the passenger boarding sequences right and doing the occassional mental arithmetic while managing your own company on a meta level works surprisingly well overall. Well done!			"

												Allow me to prefix this review with two things beforehandYes i have only played two hours. That's all i need to play for nowI am a bus driver in real life. I drive in service busses in and out of towns and cities for a living.This game is. eh at best. I don't dislike it. Personally i prefer it to OMSI 2 as there's a bit more to it in way of playing it. I like running my own company and i like buying busses and setting them/drivers to routes. I found myself acting in the game as i do on service. I count out change to passangers where required. I find myself checking tailswing and nearside kerb when it comes to mounting. I found myself shouting obsinities at a van driver who stopped for no reason in frount of me then complaining to myself (with hand movements) as to why he was a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥driver.This brings me onto one of my bigger problems with the gameThe AI is crap. Like. Really crapPedestrians are so stupid. They stand in frount of you. Then walk out when your clearly coming. They sit on the kerb and wait for your nearside to hit them because a van decided to charge head on despite you being in his land to negotiate the corner. They glitch out when trying to get on the bus, spinning around on the spot before becoming stuck. And when they are stuck, you drive off and hit them ending your session. I (admittibly) ragequit just now on a long route because a pedestrian decided to try and cross the road whilst i was already half way around the corner. and got hit by the back of my bus. It's very frustrating because that was a long♥♥♥♥♥route all down the drain.This is not to say the game is entirly bad. It's simple to pick up and all the buttons are actually labled as to what they do. Athough take note. We don't kneel at every stop. And the distances it deems ""perfect"" are actually pretty damn far away. Like a foot or so away from the kerb? no thanks. However i take into effect that this is a simulation on the same way ETS2 is. It's fun and easy to pick up, but not super serious dealthy death.timing don't work like this on busses. but again it's a simple system that's easy for newer people who know less about busses pick stuff up. Also no one in any kind of mangement system for a bus company will ever disipline you for being late. Leaving early yes, being late? No.I do wish we had a larger selection of busses. 6 MAN busses are okay, but i want to see DAF's, Optares, Volvo's, Alexendra Dennis ect. Hell i want to drive a Solo. Because i am as mad as a fish. So i hope this can be extended on and more busses can be added.I have never seen a bus company that pays people more based on how experienced they are. at least the one i work for pays you based on how long you worked for the company.All in all this isnt a bad game. It aint a brilliant game, wouldn't be worth £40. but for £18 if you fancy it, its worth a punt.			"

												Bus simulator 16, well it's no Euro Truck in terms of simulation but still early days. Im running a gtx 970 8gb ram with an i5 4690k and even after the patch im still suffering a bit on the frame rate, but its playable. a bit choppy in places. Graphically the game looks dated. Lighting isn't dynamic, indicater lights flash inside the bus also no cars indicate, water effect for rain poor, no droplets on windscreen so wipers seem pointless. car models are quite bland. bus models are nice. Something i noticed and was impressed with was during a rainy run i noticed the tress were blowing visiously in the wind i like that.Controls, I have only used my g27 and keyboard and they work lovely i love the stiffness on the wheel makes you feel like your working for it the UI in the bus is simple, so your not sitting there for 20 mins trying to work out your route codes passwords and how to switch the bugger on. Sound is quiet frankly rubbish. But the game is fun. The management side of things is much better then euro truck and it really seems this game has a good baseline to improve upon. Its moddable with steams workshop so in no time we will probably be seeing mods that will probably help improve or just expand upon a nice cheap fun game. I love the passengers, listening to the liers who are calling up work or their trainers telling them they are sick, wheel chair users and many easter eggs about people playing indie game titles and bus simulator 16 being recommended to someone for there kid. its great. Customisation, paint jobs, nice selection of colours designs and advertisements which help you earn extra money. Thats a great little touch, hoping the modders bring in real company logos.all in all this game is fun, cheap and time just drives by.			"

												I honestly like this game as I find it much easier to play than other bus simulators out there and the graphics are really good  for a Simulator but the other thing I like is you can create your own route so you make it different rather than choose routes that are already premade for you though some are in the game as well so I would reccomend this if you are into Simulators of course :).

												Very soothing experience normally, that can get very tense if you don't pay attention during critical moments. Played on an older system first and it could definitely be better optimized, but it ran ok on lower settings. No problems at all on Ultra on my gaming rig. I think it had the right amount of realism vs. sillyness, throwing a new challenge (where the hell do I turn the heat down?) and funny stuff. My favourite was the drunk guy, who first spend 70 bucks on two week tickets and then complained about ""the smell of burned toast"".			"

												Reasons why you should buy this game:1. Instead of the real term ""articulating bus,"" meaning a bus which has two halves and a connecter in the middle, the game calls it a ""Bendy Bus.""2. Driving a bus is actually hard, or maybe I'm just inept. Either way, the driving mechanics are actually decent.3. Traffic. Meaning, it is realistic. Not for people with road rage.Reasons why you shouldn't buy this game:1. You are bad at subtraction. You need to figure out how much change to give. And most people are good at subtraction. So buy this game.2. You are afraid of public transportation. Summary: Unless you are afraid of transportation or a 4 year old, BUY THIS GAME NOW.			"

I could only play on minimum settings and the fps was the lowest of any game I have played. There is potential here for it to be a good game. I would buy again if I was certain if they did optimise it! I generally agree with most of the other reviews here.			"

												Picked this up just under a week ago, very fun.  Yes, the frame rate issues can be slightly bothersome at times but it's still early days.  Highly recommendedThings I'd personally like to see added/changed:- More customisation with routes.  Choosing which bus stops to stop at is cool n all, but it'd be better if you could actually choose the route you take as well- Ability to see your companies drivers on route as you're doing a run yourself (maybe add a 'wave' function)- Ability to give out paper money as well as coins for passengers who need a large amount of change7.5/10			"

												In Bus Simulator 16, you drive a bus around a fictional city on routes you can define yourself. Events in the game influence the amount of passengers and if all stops can be served, for example. You can hire drivers to drive your routes, and the city mayor defines goals which you must reach to unlock bigger busses.I really like the management and career aspects of the game, which set it apart from the competition. There are lots of interactive parts in the bus, including unjamming malfunctioning doors. The ticket vending is very streamlined and works quite well. Overall it's quite entertaining and can be recommended for casual bus driver apprentices.			"

												After reading a lot of negative reviews about performance issues, I was reluctant to buy this game since a lot of people with high end PCs (better than mine) were complaining about lag/fps issues.  My PC meets the 'recommended specs' for this game.  I can run the game with a few jitters on medium settings which is acceptable for me.  I think the devs need to do more performance testing and adjust the recommended specs.Now that the main issues are out of the way, what does this game do well?  Well, the devs have clearly spent more time on gameplay (which is what I expect from a simulator).  The AI is good (for the most part), cars will most of the time let you pull out if you indicate and as others have said pedestrians actually wait for you if you are approaching a crossing at speed before crossing the road.  The only thing that has baffled me is when the lights are on green so I can turn right for example but the pedestrian crossing light is also on green on the road I am turning into so I have to slam my brakes on to avoid hitting people as they cross the road.  This has only happened at a few intersections so its not too bad.  If you pull up too close to the curb, pedestrians will get stuck trying to get on (but this is easily sorted by reversing and pulling up again).  I haven't played the game enough to give a thorough overview of the management side of the game but so far I am enjoying it.The devs are actively bringing out updates so hopefully they will sort out the issues in the game.  Overall, I am enjoying the game thoroughly and would recommend it (based on gameplay quality not performance).  I will warn you, if you are the type of person who wants the highest graphics settings and you exceed the recommended specs - be prepared to play on lower settings.  If gameplay is your priority, you will probably enjoy playing the game.  If you're thinking of buying the game, it might be best to wait a while until some of the major performance issues have been sorted.			"

												I have changed my review of this game thanks to MrTP for helping me out ( see comments below on graphic cards to make sure Steam is using your computers highend  graphic card)Make sure you have the correct specs otherwise you wont enjoy this gameFor $25 this sim is worth it -- its a great bus sim and very easy to play , a lot of detail has gone into the design of the management system of the game alone ..We dont have much choice when it comes to Bus sims , but by far for me -- this is the best I have played and will contine to play ( thanks again MrTP ) .....................................................................................I recommend this game and I also dont recommend this game -- ..  I say yes get it---  ONLY if you have a very high end computer - I have a $3000 Alienware system it it stuggled it keep up with the framerate -- i had to turn down the settings to lowest to get  somewhat ok gametime but I feel its overpriced for me personally considering the really bad graphics I have to put up with to play it at a basic level ..  dont waste your time if you have a limited hardware system I can run GTA V on Ultra but cant run a square bus around a ten block city -- mmmmm go figure If you have the specs required -- Play it -- its one of the better featured bus sims out on the market for the priceFROM MrTP  :From my experience you can increase your performance very much by:1. Making sure that steam uses the correct graphic card to run BS16 (please see here: http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/72567/can-i-force-steam-to-use-my-nvidia-gpu-instead-of-the-integrated-intel-card/72576#72576)2. Adjusting your graphic setting within BS16.To increase your fps rate please try to:- simply reduce the viewing distance- make sure that the option ""Always Update Bus Mirrors"" is deactivated			"

												3/5  I'll rate yes for the fact that this runs and it provide different scenes of events on routes such as someone running out in front of you to a car broken down and a slow♥♥♥♥♥driver.It is fun if you enjoy these types of games but its more of  short pass time, it has a good feel but I  do wonder if this is a start of somthing like ETS2 has provided after releasing their first one.Graphics are not 100% best but bareable if there is an update to provide some smooth edges and some reflections and smooth mirror reflections then great, the traffic flow feels slow at times but for a game under 18 quid it is not a bad little game.Pros: Drive, crash and customise different buses, hire staff, fire staff for the sake of it specally that one guy who can tell apart from red n green. I heard a fake sick  call to work... gave me an idea.Cons: long loading from start up until you're IN the game out of tutorial. Graphics could be polished, P.O.V mouse movement could range more not a glance left n right. Multiplayer is more of driving other peoples routes not drive with or join friends in a game.			"

												I spent some time with this game and I'm very impressed what they made out of it. First you don’t expect very much from it, because it is a simulator where you basically drive around with a bus. But after the tutorial and some exploring, it offers a lot of impressing features. The best one is how good  they implemented the driving experience of the bus, it feels like you’re driving a real one. The only issue is that it also brakes like a real one and so I bumped in one and another car. The Interaction with the passengers is also made very nice and detailed, beginning from making a ticket, to say to somebody that he should get away from the door or to help a wheelchair drive in and out of the bus.  The game is not only about driving the bus, you need also to manage your company and to start new routes. Therefore I’m very impressed from the game and the features that it offers.			"

												Well, where to start?!First of all: i fixed my Shift Key, and im very glad THAT ITS FIXED AGAIN! TEST TEST!!!1111!Now, where was i? Ah yes, Bus Simulator 16; never played the other 15 though.ALERT: STORY SPOILER AHEAD!The Game starts off with a nice little Tutorial; A guy named Ben (bad choice DEVs -> made me think of Spider Man -> instant cry), who sold you his Bus Company to retire and spend more Time with his old Lady (a Bus i guess), greets you and together you take a small tour through the City of...yeah, through the City.The Immersion instantly kicks in, a nice Cockpit to call your own, Buttons to push, Engines to start, Doors to open (for a summerly Experience, let the Front Door open) and so on. Minutes later you will have your first Passengers; They seem like a nice Bunch although female Students are dressed like hookers, dunno why.  Havent encountered any Pimps yet.Its impossible to rip-off your Passengers throughout the Ticket-buyin-Process; which saddens me a lot.Approaching a Station is pretty easy, you just need to ""kneel"" before your Passengers, open the Doors, engage the Breaks, and the same in Reverse if you leave the Station. The ""Action"" Cam helps a lot here (awesome Feature btw, made me feel like Don Johnson in Miami Vice *deal with it*)After 5 or 6 Stops and returning to your Garage the Tutorial ends, and the real Fun begins:You have to plan Routes, drive them and fulfill different Objectives to progress through the Game. A little later you´re able to hire Drivers (pretty random at their Personality; even had a PhD Dude who wanted to become a Bus Driver, lol)There are quite a few Options there for Customizing your Bus: Decals, ADS, Colours; Sadly no Options for the Interior (would love some tiger carpets or Dragon Skulls in my Bus).Graphics-wise i must say: 30 FPS never felt so fast (caution: irony!)The Details are OK, like in every Simulator-Game i´ve played by now. Not bad, not very good, somethin in between; The Busses look very nice though; What i really missed is a Season Pass and the  Opportunity to kidnap all your Passengers (or at least be a Getaway Driver -> maybe some cross-over with the Payday Universe?!). Maybe i am fortunate and Still Alive Studios are going to release a DLC?!All in all i enjoy riding my Bus (i look so manly in the rear-mirror doing so) throughout an unknown City, goin on a Rampage here and then, not stopping at Stations (we can't stop here this is bat country)  and after starting a new Company (the third by now) i can say:  Thankfully the Citizens do not recognize People very well!

												Usually I am not the guy who plays simulators, but I really liked the first game of stillalive studios (Son of Nor) so I gave it a try. It is actually really good work and makes a lot of fun and it bounded me 11 hours on the pc so far, and I will play it again in the weekend. What I really like is, that the feeling of steering the bus is really good. You must pay attention to get the junction right and not to bump into other cars or traffic lights/ signals. Also the physical effects are really good implemented. By slowing down or acceleration you can actually feel the big weight of the bus. There are a lot of funny things hidden in the game, which is really amusing. For example you can hire Julian (head of company) as the bus driver witch has a very amusing CV. Or the passangers are talking about Son of Nor. Many such small things where you can see the love in the detail.Good work guys! Keep going!			"

												Bus Sim 16 is a good Bus Simulator (which it obviously should be as thats what its ♥♥♥♥ing called), the action of driving a bus are fine but many aspects of the game are pretty dire. Keep in mind this game is new.The graphics are pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥and the optimization is terrible. The AI are too slow and wreckless and the vehicles models as a whole arnt great. There are also many little bugs and flaws that could/should be fixed.For people who want just a bus sim regardless of performance or graphics then this (or OMSI 2) are far the best choices, however if you like fancy graphics, polished scripting and smooth performance you will probably not enjoy this game.On the other hand give this game a few months and maybe all the bugs and flaws will be fixed and the graphics will be good and also the performance, then this game will be great.

												Bus Sim 16 is a nice game to play especially where you and your friends can build a company together. However, with a recommended spec PC I don't even get stable 30fps on the lowest settings. Also some of the animations are sloppy such as the mirrors where they don't update or move fluently along as you drive and the steering and movement can be choppy. Along with the price tag I don’t think it’s worth the full amount of £20. Don’t get me wrong it’s a nice however I would save my money wait for Fernbus to sort its issues out then buy that instead.

												I seriously can not understand where the hate this game is getting comes from. It does exactly what it says on the ""box"", and does it very well. While not a perfect game by any means, this is a great effort from a smaller company, that fills a niche I've personally desired for over 10 years.When I was a young lass, back in my high school days, I used to take the public bus to commute to school and back, and also to travel from place to place on my weekends. I spent hundreds of IRL hours on various models of IRL busses, and I always wanted to try driving one. This game finally allowed me to live my fantasy. I honestly never thought a company would ever bother to make a bus driving game, but Bus Simulator 16 actually goes above and beyond that, and includes management and a bit of strategy as well.In Bus Simulator 16, you'll assume the role of a man who has just started a bus company, and won a minor contract with the local city of Sunny Springs, and a few cheap models of busses to chose from. You'll start alone, with a limited amount of startup cash, with a small area available to you. Over time you'll prove to the city you can handle bigger contracts, which will give you access to more districts of the city, and more modern/expensive models of busses.Gameplay consists of 2 parts: driving your routes, and managing your company. Your company can be single player (offline) or co-op multiplayer (online), but if you choose to bring your company online it can not be undone. Managing your company consists of buying/maintaining busses, hiring/firing NPC (or other online players if you go multiplayer) drivers, and planning routes. You can paint your fleet various colors, and add advertisements to generate extra income.Driving is the heart of the game and you will need to drive each new route yourself first before you can assign that route to an NPC driver. You will be able to choose various models of busses to drive, including bendy (two car) busses. The in game tutorial is quick, easy to understand, and teaches you everything you need to know about driving. You will need to make all the stops on the route, while obaying traffic laws, keeping your schedule on time, charging passengers the correct fare, and making change, and accomidating any unexpected situation that may pop up.Driving the bus feels natural, and the controls are easy to pick up. The AI is dumb, and pedestrians will occasionaly step out in front of your rig, or change lanes into your path, but for the most part you can predict their behavior.  Weather, traffic jams, and various events (bouncing drunk passengers, unjamming stuck doors, extending the ramp for wheelchair bound passengers, etc.) will add variety to your routes.The dev is German, so the city/roads/laws are very european; As an American, this took some getting used to. In America, bus drivers expect you to have exact change for your fare, and carry no change. I don't know how they do things in Germany, but in this game you are expected to do math and count out correct change for everyone. This is the one part of the game that really sucks, but you'll soon memorize the appropriate amounts for each bill/fare and life will go on.The graphics are pretty bare bones, and honestly, what can you expect from a small dev making a game that will appeal to a niche group of players? I'm just happy this game got made at all. You will encounter some bugs here and there, but nothing that breaks the game or prevents you from running it smoothly (at least in my experience).Overall I would say if you're one of the people who is intrigued by the prospect of managing/driving for your own bus company, you should buy this game. It does what it sets out to do, and it works without crashing. What more can you ask for?			"

												It may have its faults but from what I've experieced, it's an enjoyable ""game"" you shouldn't take too seriously- if you're after a more reliable and slightly cheaper bus simulator than OMSI, I'd give it a go. I can't really coment on lag issues as I have 12GB of RAM behind it, but for me personally it is worth a try. Massive improvement over Bus Simulator 2012, and it's a bit ike Train Simulator, only £3000 odd cheaper and altogether more intuitive and playable. And actually fun.			"

												After 2.2 hours of playing, I think i've come up with an opinion about the game. It's quite a good bus driving simulator (better than most) however it doesn't live up to OMSI 2. That doesn't mean it's not a bad game. I actually prefer this to OMSI because of the simple fact that the UI is easier to use, but there's also lots of problems which ruin the game.Pros:- Easy to naviagate UI.- Easy to play.- Customisable buses.- The ability to stand up and walk around.- The city feels alive.- Events such as people standing in the way of doors, doors getting stuck etc.Cons:- Bugs. I found a bug where I stopped at a bus stop, was told I didn't need to stop there, drove away from the bus stop and was told that i had skipped a bus stop.- Fines are too high. It's almost impossible to make money because you'll likely keep crashing.- Driving feels sluggish/stiff.- (I'm not sure if this changes after progressing through the game) At the beginning of the game, you're unable to do certain routes because ""roads are closed due to events that will/have happened"". It gets annoying and means you have to drive unnecessary distances to reach bus stops in your route or it will add more stops to it which you likely won't want.- The graphics.- Optimisation.I'd rate it 6/10. It could be improved but it is playable and enjoyable.			"

												It's no secret that I've got a soft spot for what some might cruelly call the ""mundane simulator""I've trucked and farmed my way through many a simulator title and I've loved them all.When I'm gaming I don't really discriminate between genres, being a gun toting super hero is fun but sometimes I just want to do something different, something normal that I'll probably never to get experience in my own ""real life"" something alternative but ""mundane"".I've come to terms with the fact that I'm firmly stuck in my rut in life, I'm never likely to be a truck driver or a farmer but these simulator games give you a chance to get a feeling of what it might be like, they give you a chance to experience a different life.It's the ultimate reality based escapism and it can definitely be a lot more fun than it sounds.So I've hauled cargo across Europe, I've trucked around the USA and I've farmed until the cows came home but I've never been a bus driver.Today we're going to fix that!Simple LifeLike a lot of jobs, on the surface it sounds pretty simple, I mean driving a bus, how hard could it be?You get to sit down all day and cruise around in a big circle, stopping every few minutes along the way.It doesn't sound too difficult does it?Your cargo even unloads itself!Ahhh to be a bus driver, that'd be a good life.With this mind I fired up Bus Simulator 16 ready for some hard core bus based business but I soon learned that being a bus driver isn't just about driving a bus, there's a wealth of bells and whistles that go along with the job that complicate things, which is just as well because it adds a little depth to what would other whys be a pretty simple driving game with some pretty bland scenery, but we'll get onto that later.The Wheels on the Bus...First the driving mechanic, a pretty important part of any game which involves driving and has the word ""simulator"" in the title.You'll have access to six different buses in the base game (who knows what DLC might bring) but for the most part this variety is purely cosmetic, the handling between each ""flavour"" of bus feels identical and the driving experience is more arcade than simulator.Speed and handling feel a little off (not that I've ever driven a bus, but I've been a passenger on a few) and the ride itself always feels disconnected from the road, it's too smooth and floaty, there's no rumble of an uneven road surface, no potholes to avoid (or deliberately drive over to annoy the passengers). The wheels on the bus might go round and round but there's no real sense that they're in contact with the road.This makes the driving part of Bus Simulator 16 a flat experience and that's a real shame.The Buttons on the BusWhilst the actual driving physics are pretty basic there are still plenty of interactions with the vehicle to put some ticks in the simulation box.You get to turn the key to start your engine, flick the switches to put on the various lights both inside and outside the cab.There are buttons to raise and lower the bus and you even have a heater you can play with.The simulation doesn't restrict you to sitting in the driver seat either, if you feel the need you can always pull over and get out to stretch your legs (or stare unnervingly at your passengers who pretend not to notice).Tickets Please!Bus Simulator 16 isn't just about driving a bus around, there are plenty of other things you'll need to take care of too.Some passengers will need to buy a ticket from you, sounds straight forward right?but there are different ticket types, single, student, weekly, etc. and do you think they'll have the correct change?Of course not!So you'll be working the ticket machine, selecting the ticket type and duration, printing out the tickets and calculating the correct change in your head all whilst you keep one eye on the clock.There's a time table to stick to and everyone hates it if the bus is late.Pesky PassengersIt's not just the ticket sales which slow down the turnaround time either, some passengers might require extra help, a person in a wheelchair for example will need you to vacate the drivers' seat and put down the ramp for them to board the bus, of course you'll need to stow the ramp away again before you head off.There's also a high probability that the disabled passenger will actually want to get off your bus again at some point, that'll mean you've got another ramp based delay to look forward to as you drive the route.The passengers don't even leave you alone when they've finally paid up and sat in their seats either. You'll be happily driving along, trying to make time back up on your route when you'll hear a moaning voice echo along the bus, ""I'm too hot"" or ""It's too cold in here, can you do something about the temperature?"".... ughhh, so now you're having to mess around with the air con. whilst keeping an eye on the sat nav. and another on the road. You wouldn't want to crash or run down a pedestrian, that might hurt your profit margin (and be bad for whoever you hit of course).Bus Mechanic 16So you herd the cattle (Sorry, passengers) onto the bus and manage not to freeze them, cook them or crash them into anything but there are still other things which can delay you.Even if the traffic is clear, the passengers are behaving and the traffic lights are green things can still go wrong.The bus itself can work against you, there can be mechanical issues which require your attention.For example the doors could become jammed and your cargo (sorry, passengers) are a fickle bunch and don't seem to like the thrill of being chauffeured around with the doors wide open, they worry about silly little things like falling to their death.You can pull over and fix these mechanical annoyances but it all takes time... time you'll need to make up on the road if you don't want to be late.Like the Back End of a Bus!Visually the game is a little disappointing, it's not ugly but the textures are fairly plain.Don't go into this expecting photo realism, or even Truck Simulator quality graphics or you'll be disappointed by the view.Even at the highest settings the view distance on your rear view mirror is surprisingly low. You're constantly followed by what looks like really thick white fog pursuing you along the city streets, it's kinda scary really (Have you ever seen the Stephen King movie ""The Mist""?).You're not just restricted to driving around one district either, as you progress in the game you'll be able to unlock 4 more to keep things interesting (the scary ""mirror fog"" will follow you to these districts too!)One Route to Rule Them AllIn addition to all the thrills of driving a big old bus around there's also a management simulation aspect to Bus Sim 16.Keeping your passengers happy and the fares rolling in is good for company profits and that's good for you because you own the company.You can tweak the look and colour of your buses and cover them in adverts to bring in some extra revenue.You'll be setting up bus routes and hiring drivers to trundle along them all in the name of profit, profit which you can then re-invest in more buses and more drivers.End of the LineBus Simulator 16 is an interesting title and whilst it can be fun there's no denying that it lacks a little polish.This is a niche game, it's not going to be for everyone, but if you're looking to try something a little different and think the life of a virtual bus driver might be for you then that's an itch this game will happily scratch.

Still only have a couple of hours with the game, but I'm enjoying it.  Graphics are somewhat dated, gameplay can seem mundane...but it's relaxing and challenging at the same time.

												   I have had no problem running this game with no lag and a small hiccup once in a while. Believe the reccommended specs and don't bother if you don't meet them.    This one is miles better than it's predessor and the goals list for the company keep the game interesting. I also love the ability to make your own routes. Lots of vehicles, reasonable budget vs. economy, although the one run = one week's income is a little wierd, but I suppose necessary or the progression would take forever.    My only real gripe is the steering, either with mouse/keyboard or Xbox controller. It has a real learning curve and after 5 hours it has become comfortable, although moving out to 3rd person view to negotiate some of those tight corners is almost a must. Astragon has never done a very good job at first-person driving and I would love to see a Euro-truck level of  expertise in the driving mechanics. Otherwise, this game is great, and I would reccommend it.			"

												I don't normally write reviews because I don't like to skew other peoples enjoyment of a game.  I have driven all the simulation games on the market and this is quite good in a lot of respects but there is one really annoying aspect of this game which has had me SO frustrated.  That is THE TRAFFIC.  It's rubbish, slow, thick, annoying and generally bores tha pants off me.  You spend more time crawling along the road behind them or you are stuck at never changing traffic light where nothing is moving.  It doesn't make you late but sitting looking at a computer game that is doing NOTHING is annoying.  If they don't  change the traffic signals and traffic movement it will bore me off the game.Would I recomend it - YES if you like sitting around doing nothing and NO - if you want to drive.			"

												Bus simulator 2016 is quite enjoyable. If you can see past it's rough edges. The handling isn't that great, the busses feel very floaty when trying to stear. The game isn't optimised properly. It doesn't look bad but this title should not have such high demands for what is shown. Over to the good parts of Bus simulator 2016! There is a good variety of busses, they all are very detailed. Don't be easily fooled by the scale of the map. At first it looks small but once you're actually driving in it, you'll start to see that it takes quite a while to traverse through this map. There is a lot of variety aswell in the scenary. It doesn't look bland at all which is a good thing. There is also mod support which is fantastic and keeps the game alive. Conclusion : This is a great simulator but unfortunately has issues with optimization. I've already played 2 hours and it's a lot of fun in my opinion. I'll definitely be playing for awhile. I suggest you buy it if you really love bus simulators, otherwise just wait for a price cut.			"

												Great Game!Thing I Like To See Added Are Maybe 1)AI Buses so that it does not feel that your the only bus on the road.2)More Buses(Maybe Even Like Scania,Volvo or Mercedes)3)Rain Droplets On The WindShield4)Add Free Roam DrivingThings I like To Be Changed1)Faster Moving AI Vehicles2)Can Choose Which Side Of The Bus Stops(Like I Can Drive To The Same Bus Stops On Different Side Of The Road)3)Choose To Drive What Ever Route You Want And Do Another Without Going Through The Weekly ThingOverall I Would Recommand This Game.Gives The Feel Of Real Bus Driving.Not As Good As OMSI 2 But Still Like It			"

												I'll be blunt: the game looks and runs like♥♥♥♥♥ The game's requirements may seem a little high, but, sadly, they are accurate, perhaps even too low - apparently especially with respect to memory consumption.I bought Bus Sim thinking those requirements were just highly overestimated to make sure the game runs smoothly for you even if your OS is slowing things down. No such luck. I decided to risk it and regret it. Playing in a window at the lowest settings, I still struggled to maintain stable 15 fps in the tutorial run. Neither the game's visuals nor gameplay justify the performance in the slightest. Worse yet, after several tries I've been unable to start even a single post-tutorial run without the game crashing while loading.Apparently I've been spoiled by SCS's Truck Simulator series into thinking a simulator could run and play well.In short: avoid. Try OMSI 2 instead.			"

												As somebody that has countless hours of ETS2 i really like this game, its not as polished as the forementioned game but still worth a try if you like the bus thing. While it runs fine on my PC on ultra with the ssaa turned off it can still have a lag or two in places. I seem to think this has something to do with the forced feedback feature which i dont use.. you also need to mess about with the steering adjustments in the settings to get it to feel right as at default its too light and set up to drive like a sports car but with a bit of tweaking you can get it to feel right. Same with mouse movement. Graphics are not too bad on Ultra and the AI keeps you on your toes as they are all a bit stupid, but no worse than ETS2, pedestrians have a death wish though, so watch them on the crossings.Its quite tweakable really from the annoying incidents like door jammings and stupid passengers stood in the doorway so you have to get out and shift them, these incidents can be turned down to a minimum or increased.. its up to you. also great to see the use of wheelchair passengers in the game, thats a really nice touch.This game just has a nice feeling attached to it, as somebody who has driven his own car for many years, it brought back many memories of that early morning bus ride to work when i was younger, the engine sound is spot on. not to mention my dad was a bus driver, my mum was a clippy ( the lady that walked up and down the bus saying fares please in the olden days of the 60s) :)Downside for me, and ive been playing about 5 hours or so, there doesnt seem to be any weather systems or day night, give me a rainy winters night driving a bus and im in heaven..Its not bad if you can run it and they do seem to be updating it..

												The game is really engaging. During the day, you will face different small events like stuck doors which makes the overall simulation very immersive and leads to a fun gameplay. I also like the visualization of the game, e.g. the ticket-selling procedure feels right - you have to print the right ticket and give back the right change to the customers. The wohle meta-game with managing your own bus company adds depth and engages you to keep playing. By now I am a quite decent bus driver, but sometimes I do too hard brakes on the bus stops ;) Btw. how can I kneel the bus?			"

												Hello My name is Mike and I am aka Sim UK.  I have been running a Bus Sim 16 Let's Play since this game came out.  I have reviewed and updated the Youtube community on all patches and Updates and will continue to do so:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-Al6rzTlW-h2Y7i_6ikKp1GXWdbvnWf-I am a big fan of OMSI2 but not of the bugs and issues that come as part of it.  I was hoping that Bus Sim 16 was going to be the solution to the OMSI problem but it isnt really the same kind of game, let me explain;OMSI is a tremendously accurate and capable bus simulator with modding tools which allow the community to enhance update and develop copius amounts of top quality add-ons, which is why this game is still being played and sold today.Bus Simulator 16, despite its title, is not a simulator.  I think the best way to decribe it is that it is a casual Simulator, a new breed of simulator that is in part an arcade game.  Because of the title many people bought this game expecting a simulated experience and were bitterly dissapointed as a result, as was I.Over time I have grown to like this game a great deal, IF the developers enable players to start modding (PROPERLY and FULLY) new buses and most importantly maps, then this game will have a long an prosperous life, if they don't then this is a fun to play one off that will just dissapear in the next year or two.Pros-----Nice enough graphics and gameplay.Works out of the box.Lots of missions to keep you gong for a while at least.Fun.If £10 this is a bargain.  £15 OK but better to wait. £20 Nope, too much :(Cons====There are numerous graphic issues.AI is poor but funtional most of the time.Very poor modding tools, so limited they are useless.1 map only and no way to create new ones.Poor optimisation!  I have a decent PC and have no issues but there are plenty who do.UPdates are usually poor, no content and include no real imporvement.Overall this is a fun game to play, its easy to learn and doesnt get boring (somehow?)RATING (6.5/10) Would be more if modding tools were made available.

												I started this with a fair expectation.  On well so much for that.Lets talk about controls, using a wheel and pedals pressing brake twice engages reverse.  The steering starts turning very slow then gets much quicker about halfway through the turn.  Also why get me to define gear up and down in the settings if they dont work???If it rains, both the rain and wipers seem like they're working in slow motion whilst everything else is moving at normal speed.You press the key to look at either side mirror, it slowly changes to that side and slowly back.  If you look with the mouse, you have to move back withthe mouse also, not good when driving.  Especially as the AI is worse than the AI in ETS2 and ATS.The 'route planner' is a falicy, you cant plan the route, you click on the desired stops and it gives you the roads you have to travel.  So instead  of a single outer road to follow, you'll have a series of turns and lights that take longer to get there.It isn't all bad though, the idea of the route planner is a good start, maybe have the switching of views to be instant if desired.  Let players unbind dual controls or assign a single control eg brakes for braking only.  I can't in all fairness recommend this game as thers too much enjoyment killing issues.  I will however keep this in my watch list just in case it gets better.  Maybe I've been spoilt by ETS2 and ATS.  Who knows, time will tell.			"

Once I lost my job as a bus driver I then moved on to professional gaming... so you can imagine how thrilled I was whenever I saw this game. As both a professional bus driver AND gamer I could not be more impressed with this game. Very realistic, I've worked in the business and let me tell you this is just like the business. Very realistic, great tutorial, very fun, very immersive... I felt like I was driving buses again!For my reviews like this please visit my streamhttp://www.twitch.tv/kaceytron.com "

												There are some good points about this game- Good interaction with customers, e.g. cashier, indicating, ramps, etc.- Good interface and managing bus company optionsBut there are a lot of bad points:- Controls don't work, there are some that have no effect. E.G. setting a control to ""look left"" will turn your wheel left when using mouse controls, rather than pointing your camera that way. Therefore I have no way to look left when using my mouse to steer.- Laggy at times- Cars randomly beep their horn at you, e.g. when picking passengers up at a bus stop.- Cars do not overtake buses when stopped, leading to a massive queue of traffic.

												After watching videos for this i thought this would be a great simulator in the vein of train simulator and euro truck simulator 2, i was pretty wrong. The town you are set in is very dull to look at and the road designs are boring. There is very little variety to traffic or scenery. The handling of the buses seems off entirely, far too floaty with no real feedback to the road. graphically the game is very poor, the bus models arent too bad buy everything else looks like a ps2 game upresed and to make that seem worse it doesn't even run well. I exceed the recommended specs yet i only get 15-20fps. I would not recommend spending the money on this game until it is optimised better and had some better car and scenery models patched in. I have personally requested a refund for the game, if it improves them i may give it another chance but right now i will be getting american truck simulator instead			"

												It's apparent that stillalive studios has made a wholeheartedly attempt at making a bus simulator.The game lets you control everything from opening the garage door to printing tickets and giving change to you customers. The games UI feels fresh and modern and is pretty easily navigated. I like that you can make your own bus routes and assign drivers to drive them.Unfortunately for me, the games falls flat in one of the most important mechanics, the driving part.The handling feels very loose and the bus veers all over the place, and I'm playing on a controller with the sensitivity on its minimum setting. It doesn't feel like you are steering a 14-ton bus when it jerks at the smallest input on the joystick.As mentioned by other players, the voice acting is not very good. At all. And before reaching my first hour of playtime i was already hearing the same chatter from the people in my bus as i was hearing in the beginning, it seems that they haven't recorded that many lines for people to say.The game has a couple of pretty interesting mechanics though. The doors on the bus can jam and you will be forced to close them manually, emergency vehicles can rush up behind you with their sirens on wanting you to move over, there's dynamical construction sites and more stuff.But ultimately, for me, the game has potential but i cannot recommend it in its current state. The steering is too off and the game has some obvious optimization issues. I'm considering refunding it and maybe coming back if it's patched.			"

												I will be honest, I was not really expecting much from this. I had previously seen some other simulators around friends houses and not really been overly interested, but this caught my eye.Once having downloaded it, I jumped straight in. I was pleasently suprised by it's innovative way of teaching the user how to drive the bus and how it kind of ran you into the first steps, without just dropping you in with an automated start.The game overall plays well. The content of the NPC's vocabularly seems to lack sometimes - which makes for a tiny bit of disconnection from the game itself, but overall I really enjoyed being able to found my own company, learn how to drive the bus/coach and even more, which I found fantastically fun, make money from picking up those customers.Remember, it's not all about just making sure you don't crash the damned thing, it's more about satisfying those customers to get a decent return on your company. Attempting to put all of those together takes time and practice, and you can have a lot of fun on that journey!If you are a SIMULATOR fan, I would suggest this one!			"

												--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The game just exudes an overall lack of polish and detail, which, unfortunately, detracts from the few new features the game touts over other bus driving games and falls short on its ‘simulation’ aspect.

												It's a great Bus Simulation game, but it doesn't feel finished and shouldn't be a full release.- Not enough content in the game.- Performance issues, even with high end systems.- Lacks updates to keep the game interesting.Regardless, this game is a bunch of fun, especially if you like Simulation games.The developers just need to add extra content and optimize the game itself.

												As much as I'd like to say the game is broken, that would be under the assumption that the game originally worked. Would not recommend purchasing this game, unless you want to rage quit from a bus simulation game.PROS:- At least it launches?- Supports keyboard/mouse, controller, and wheelsCONS:- Glitches. Everywhere.- Invisible cars- Invisible walls- Invisible pedestrians- Poor performance, even on high-end builds- Speeding tickets while stopped at red lights- Falling through the map gets boring after a while- Passengers won't shut upOVERALL RATING: 2/10			"

												I travel per bus daily and I've always wondered what it would be like to be a bus driver. Well, I guess I found out!What makes Bus simulator so great are the random events happening around you. Just noticing your blinkers have effect on cars around you feels great, but honking at a car to let him ride away from the bus stop feels even better! As for driving, I'm not playing with a steering wheel but I think the driving system is good. The one thing that kind of annoys me is creating routes so you can finish your goals. One part of the city is all one way roads and trying to make a nice route there is almost impossible.tl;dr If you like busses, this game is what you're looking for!			"

Posted: April 16, 2016
												I REALLY REALLY like this game.At first I was unsure being somewhat put off by negative reviews. However StillAlive have already patched the game which has improved the performance issues. So, with this in mind, after watching Squirrel's Lets Play videos on YouTube I decided to purchase a copy.Very easy to get the hang of, much easier than OMSI. I have OMSI too. BS16 is more sophisticated than arcade type driving games but not as ""simulatorish"" as OMSI. Creating Bus routes and customising your company buses is also great fun.I find the Customer interactions very enjoyable. Walking on and off the bus and walking around the cabin of the bus is also a very enjoyable experience. The most ""realistic"" passengers I have encountered in this type of game too. Far better than OMSI of Train Simulator for example.All in all this is a very enjoyable game, I hope StillAlive Studios release further expansions in the form of city maps and of course buses. (we already have a new bus in the form of MAN Lios City A47M!!) and at a very affordable price! £1.59!!If you have any doubts about buying this, watch Squirrels Lets Play. He gives a very good overview of the game.			"

												Pros:-Can run smoothly-Focuses on things like passangers-Simple yet fun-More stable than OMSI 2-Less glitchy than OMSI 2-The AI is at least more intelligent than OMSI 2'sCons:-Passangers have lacking dialogue (e.g. Bubble Tea conversation,""Thank You dear"" etc)-GPS somehow screws up on my first run of the game (There is said to be a route diversion on an event,a inner Suburb District route suddenly connects to Kolb Convention Center which is on the Business District)-No Camera Mode-Lacking decals and ads options(Both only have 8)-No Highway which makes you stuck with the normal city roads and limits fast route choicesSummary:Decent game but it feels incomplete			"

												I think this is an overall great game.This game has a very dynamic world. The passengers have a variety of conversations, and there is many different situations that can take place, such as a jammed door. You may even be affected by road works, and rush hour traffic. The developers have really captured the real-life Bus atmosphere. I was amazed at the support for a wide variety of wheels, such as the Logitech G29. I really enjoyed the online companies, although you can't drive with your friends, you can manage a company together, which I think was a great idea, because it makes you really think about your decisions, as you need to discuss them with other players.However, it seems like it isn't very well optimised as it doesn't run brilliantly (they're trying to work on this, and they are doing a great job).  The only other complaint I have is fixed-pricing. I was expecting to be able to adjust my prices, and have the number of passengers vary, due to my pricing. I do really hope they add adjustable pricing.This game is most defiently worth giving a try, because you can really tell that a lot of time has been put into it!			"

												There might be a nice game in here. However with a recommended spec PC I don't even get stable 30fps on the lowest settings. What I do notice is that my GPU RAM is always maxed out at 2GB (in comparison ATS and ETS use well under 1GB while looking way nicer and running fluently) and uses about 7GB RAM. This seems somewhat excessive, given the performance is still bad.Also, for a bus simulator, the driving mechanics leave a lot to be desired.			"

												I really didnt enjoy the game. To start off, The game ran really slow, and I know that my computer can run a game like Arma 3 at ultra settings while having over 60 frames for seconds. after fixing my lag issues i ended up having to switch to lowest settings on a resolution of 720p that was orriginaly 1080p. The controls are pretty clunkey and the ai were a really big pain. Over all I really didnt like the game, The graphics are pretty bad aswell. This is just my oppinion about the game. its your money and no one can tell you what you can or cannot do with it. This is just some advice that the game isnt the greatest bus simulator out there. anyways thanks for reading.			"

												For all we know, Astragon is known to be the Reverse King Midas of simulators, turning everything it touches into turd. Expectedly, BS2k16 doesn't catch stars for you, surprising with subpar performance (come on, 15FPS even on GTX750Ti? With THESE visuals?) and sudden crashes out of nowhere...Okay. It crashed on me only twice but I had to resolve it with playing in windowed mode. Not the editor's choice, if you ask me.Handling will feel familiar for those who had to sit through SCS Soft's Bus Driver back then. Except there's no penalty for slamming the brakes (unless you engage handbrake of any kind) and MAN A23 has stopping distance on par with supercars. Seems like it's a simulator not in regards of vehicle behavior but rather of what a bus can do and what a bus ride can be, with pneumatic suspension ""kneeling"" for these self-entitled meatbags on bus stops, with doors jamming on a freshly bought bus, lights, cashier, opening doors and livestock in the cabin throwing fits if they suspect you're too slow (shut your trap you offbeat womanchild before I gnaw on your ugly low-polygonal face without leaving the seat).In that particular thing - putting you in a bus driver's shoes - BS2k16 excels a lot, covering up for all possible bugs and drawbacks you may find. Don't buy it for full price though.			"

												I really like this game, the interaction with the AI is good with different situations makes the game more intersting and developed. The update has made it run smoother. You will find your self spending many hours on your company and with your bus designs.  The Man buses are good and the others are okay. However they could increase the amount of buses that are in the game like more Man's , Mercedes or Scania buses would be nice. Or a rival bus company in the game so that we can work to be better than them. A more involed mulitplayer would be good too. Never the less the game is good for bus lovers but needs some work then it would be perfect.			"

												Not as bad as they say. It's a good bus operations simulator and worse bus physics simulator. You get economics model (something not available in other games of this type), graphics is as it is (rain is horrible, sunny weather is acceptable considering it's a bus sim not FPS game), licensed buses are beautiful and there is Citaro DLC coming soon. Stability is OK, I didn't have any crashes. I don't monitor my FPS but I maxed out everything and performance is decent so not sure on what kind of calculators some people tried to run it. There is plenty of non-standard situations happening all the time and that keeps me interested. I just started to play it but I know I won't stop anytime soon. It's current, newest competitor about coach buses has much less interesting things to offer apart from better graphics and physics. Ultimately, I got them both but I think this one interests me more.			"

												As bus simulators go, this is a top notch one. Very much on par with Truck & Euro Truck Sim.I'm a bus driver and I think this would make a very good training tool for new drivers or those wanting to be one. Only things letting it down is that you can't convert it from European to U.K workings like: £'s, mph, left lane/right hand drive vehicles and so on! Would be awesome if you could give multiple colours to you livery rather than a base colour with logos and adverts.... but I'm just being picky! Would love a London Bus add on if it could be done!

												Continuing the Story of Half Life Episode 2, you play as the infamous Gman who is trapped in Sunny Springs, his personal purgatory.The devil itself manifests itself as ""Ben"". He appears on a parking lot, surrounded by grotesque molten into each other cars.This is your life now.  ""You seem like a nice guy"" Ben says... he's mocking you. You are trapped, you can't escape.There are no exists leading out of Sunny Springs, there is no way to break free.You look into the mirror and see a wall of mist following you... it eradicates your past, it keeps you going. You don't want to know what happens if the mist catches you... you have to continue driving.BUS SIMULATOR 16!It's good.			"

												""Simulator"" is not proper describe of this product. It is more or less arcade with some optimalization problems - and this is reason why I can not reccomend the game. Players with a little bit older PC will be disappointed. I have Intel i3 with HD7770. GTA 4 + 5 runs on 59 fps...It is fun good looking but not so good playable game. If you really want simulation and experience of real physics and driving - I'd reccomend OMSI 2 - it is about compromise between graphics and smooth running of game.There are some bus customization possibilities - paints, colours etc... Management of your virtual company... This is for arcade players... As I said... Arcade... Not my style but I'm sure there's many players who will like it.			"

												I cannot understand the many negative comments on this game. Im not sure what people expect from a relatively cheap, non-AAA game. Im playing on the 'test' performance version and it runs well and have not had any crashes thusfar and I get the feeling many of the earlier gripes have been attended to. PROs:+ It looks decent enough.+ The performance patch has made the game a lot better.+ Very good G27 steering wheel support, ready to play when I plugged it in.  Not even Project Cars or Assetto did that, and it took me an afternoon to set up my wheel on OMSI 2! + Very accesible and super intuitive user interface+ Ability to run your own company, hire and fire drivers, create  lines: these add to the fun and  playability.  + Has an easy to use, uncomplicated cashier system with English speaking Passengers+ Driving is not as realistic as OMSI 2 but, it definitely is not  completely arcade. Realism is at the very worst, passable.+ Its surprisingly stable and bug free. CONS :- Single map limits the game somewhat, making it easy to burn out on the gameplay quicker than Id like.- No force feedback for engine vibration or terrain, makes the driving experience feel 'floaty'.-Workshop items are a little sparse. I think if the developers continue to work on the realism and physics of the gameplay and continue to implement suggesstions made by the community, as they have been doing, this game will hands down beat the competition.If you are looking for a starter Bus SImulator - this is the better choice. If you want an excellent, hightly realistic driving experience, but dont mind wrestling with a horribly quirky user interface,  dealing with lots of German and have the patience to figure out a hard to access, complicated routing system, get OMSI.Dont hate me, but I have been playing this as my bus simulator of choice. It may not be as realistic as it gets, but its great fun.			"

												A thumbs down here. I will change it if a couple of things are fixed;1. Optimise the game - this is development 101 and there is  no way a game with these type of graphics should run at anything other than full speed ahead.2. Introduce TrackIR support - essential for any driving simulator.This has the potential to be a fantastic game, however, look at fixing some of these more important issues as a priority before releasing DLC (which you have already done).Fix the two major issues listed above and it will be a thumbs up for me.

Just looks like kid has done the game look at omsi 2 i mean the textures are not that game (If the map maker is bad in buidling maps and takes low texture buidlings) Yeah but the graphics,Procescor etc. You need for this game are ridicilous i would not recommend this game for those reasons... But if you still play the game if you put the graphics higher there is a possibility that you get a fps boost also.....			"

												Well, to start off, if you think you have met the system requirements. Don't be fooled. This game on ULTRA LOW graphics settings, on resolution 1024X768 (My monitor is normaly 1920X1080), on everything turned down...my PC which has 12GB RAM an OFBOARD Graphics card (and yes steam uses this graphics card) my quad-core processer with 3.60GHZ isn't fast enough for this low-end looking game. They asked €20+, just don't be fooled. Wait untill they have fixed the issue with this game, because without stuttering and low FPS (20 or lower) you won't play this game, unless you have a better PC with the newest graphics card (maybe?). Don't get me wrong, the game on itself is wonderful. Let's say it this way, for now don't buy it. For the future and all DEV's who are reading this, it has potential. Well, I am not touching this game anytime soon, unfortunatly.			"

Nice there is a possibility to create a bus business with colleagues, butEven Bus Simulator 2009 was better in performance than this, at least you could feel the real 70km/h speed.It had also similar features included... oh wait... there were more buses than here! And an Autobahn!To be honest - price is just outrageous. If you don't want to frustrate yourself, better don't buy it. If you did, better refund and spend it for OMSI 2 or even Garry's Mod! "

												I have 41 minutes of play time.My setup - Beyond computer requirementsG29 Steering Wheel/ClutchI always review videos and saw that Squrrel had posted one. I've been looking for another sim based driving game to go along with my steering wheel since ATS and ETS2 currently aren't matching my requirements as far as ATS not releasing their game patch for months and ETS not on the mutiplayer scene as much anymore.Bus Sim 16 is probably great if you use mouse and keyboard. Took mutiple attempts to try to get it to see my G29 and register it in. Too many controls for the bus that make it impossible to run the G29 solo without a keyboard and mouse. Game wouldnt allow me to use my L3 and R3 buttons for blinkers or anything else, kept forcing the map icon to appear. Also the feedback and control over this game is terrible. My bus would go about 30 and if I barely moved my steering to the right it would hard feedback (past autocentering) to the left and then again back to the right. If I let go my steering wheel would just bounce back and forth and my bus would be out of control.Great game concept, glad to see they fixed the dashboard looks from what the youtube video posted but game developers ( I thought ) that deal with driving sims should understand that people are going to want to play the game SOLOY with their wheels and their limited amount of buttons. ""Driving"" the character to the bus was fun but no interaction allowance to open the door and be able to sit down.All in all great concept, half way decent graphics, but I have only requested 1 additional refund to this game and that was  Xcom2.2 Requests for refunds over how ever many years Steam has been alive.

												Well is this a good game well let´s sort this out with the the (pos) and (neg) stuff. I will judge this on my game experience and on the real life experience since i am bus driver.1 = Bad10 = Very goodPos...1. It is a great driving felling in terms of steering, could be a bit less delay but overall a 7/102 The Passanger interference is very god and realistic, you get all the questions and demands that you get in the real world and also that they pay attention on how you drive and comment if you drive bad. Finaly a fun thing is when they stand in the way of the door which happens on real as well. 10/103. The company experience is great because you get the chance to build up a working buss company from skratch and make sure to keep you budget and follow the states demands. 6/10Neg...1 = Doesn´t bother me that much10 = I wanna give the game to my dog 1. The graphic could be a lot better, it does look a bit cheap. 8/102. The detail of the busses are both good and bad, it´s not close to as good as OMSI and a bit worse than City bus simulator muinch and bus simulator 2012. 6/103. The camera rotation is bad!, you can only turn the camera to like 2 to the left which makes it hard when you are in an intersection adn want to look to the left, well you don´t realy get a good view, and might bump in to a car when you turn. 6/10So would i buy this? No i would not, i think the negatve parts especialy the graphic is to bad and other games like OMSI is a lot better!!4/10Here is a good video

												I am only 2 hours in the game but I already love the level of detail: You can control every little part of the bus as well as the surrounding local transport business. If you are into busses go buy this.Also the little stories you hear when the passengers talk are quite amusing and give it a good feeling.			"

												I love simulators as i have my g27 steering wheel, i play euro truck simulator 2 and playing this bus simulator is horible they make it look so good but when you actually play it is horrible, graphics are bad, physics are bad, AI is bad, and the worst part is that it does not let you use a logitech g27 steering wheel, can use the shifter or the clutch, you can steer go forward and back thats it lol and its £18.99 ? bit of a joke if you ask me, im a game developer and i will not release a game this bad for this much in price !

												Bus Simulator 16 in a nutshell is a fun and accessible simulator game that seems to have had a lot of thought put into the experience and provides a lot of customisation options to the player - the ability to manage your own bus company is very compelling and adds more to the experience of driving the buses, you really feel ownership over your own operation. Had no major technical problems playing the game and enjoyed my 2 or so hours with it so far. Solid experience, especially considering this is the devs' first time making a simulator game.			"

												I bought this game when it was on sale so I don't feel like I've been completely ripped off, but I wish I could've even saved the money I did spend on it even though it was on sale and was a good price. The game is laggy and have a gaming PC. Also the graphics are not good. It's too cartoonish and I feel like I'm playing the Sims, not playing a real driving simulator such as train sim and American truck sim, etc. The game is not good, the map isn't big and again, it's just too ""cartoonish"" looking and not realistic enough for me. It reminds me also of a game a toddler would enjoy because of how it looks. Not good!!			"

Posted: March 3, 2016
												can I recommend this Bus simulator, well YES and NO.And let me start by saying that if you consider buying this or some other bus simulator then I would highly recommend you to buy bus and cable car simulator instead..Well let me review Bus simulator 16 first, it is actual quite good and have allot of good things to offer for a low price.First of all the graphics are not 2016 std. and look a bit old, though it do not matter that much since where are here to drive a bus right ? ;-)Well the city itself is create well and there is a mix of both ordinary recidential and more dence areas with sky scrapers and conventions centers, and that make it interesting to driver from a-z.The streets are filled with cars and pedestrians and sometimes even emergency vehicles that you need to let pass.It also happen that cars drive out in front of you or pedestrians almost walk on the street in front of you, so you need to keep your eyes open. Well I like these small events now and then it make the game interesting.One other things that make the game interesting is the ability to exit your seat and walk arround in the world and solve small problems. For example a drunk guy enters the bus so you have to get up and ask him to leave.And one in a while you also have to help handicapped people in/out of the bus by exit the bus and extending the ramp ;-)The all new ""run a bus business"" feature is nice, and you can even compare how well you are doing to other players though some have kind of unrealistic billion usd scores.Anyway you can also invite your friends to come and drive a trip in your bus and follow one of your routes that you create and it is kind of nice i think.It is also possible to paint your car and stick commercials on it to earn a little more, though It not really where that important to me.Well the bus driving experience is kind of okay. The feeling of sitting in the seat and driving I would say is realistic and the bus feel big ect. And you can also press various keys and sell tickets ect. The bus is also well made and in general give a good impression.However the controls of the game are not that facinating.First of all the game do not yet support Trackir ( the dev. wrote on the forum that they consider implementing it ).So many people are now forced to use the mouse to look arround or setup X and Y key on their wheel to look left and right. No matter what it is not the same as trackir and free look with the mouse. ALso I really miss the ability to look 90 degrees left and right in the bus since it is hard to see the trafic when at a T crossing and only can look 75-80 degrees left and right.Well all in all I think price level is good fair price for the product. The game is not bad, and have many nice features ( like you can hear small talk in the bus, such as boss i cant go to work today ).Also the get in and get out of the bus by passengers work pretty good, and you often fill your bus pretty good with passengers.I also like that sometimes there are events such as holliday where there are tons of passengers waiting for a ride.The game it self work in such a way you unlock features by driving from a-b.. in about 3 hour of gameplay I am level 10-11 and have unlocked the biggest bus in the game and half of the map.To unlock more I need to play the game and get xp, but I can also solve some goals ( such as having 2 bus stops in each unlocked zone ect ). All in all not a bad game but it do feel a bit like an arcade bus simulator, so I really prefer the older game named ""Bus and cablecar simulator"" since the busses are a little more realistisc, and the game experience is just a bit more fun and realistic.

												Poorly optimized.Have played for about 7 hours and to say its frustrating would be an understatement. The game sets you up to fail if you build your company in the way they want you to.Also the route planning is just awful. Doesnt allow you to pick what side of the road you want to stop at, leading to crazy routes. Addicting for about 4 hours, then it just gets dull and non challenging.			"

It features a lot of controls and is very accurate, although I found the speeding tickets and the red lights a bit annoying at times, but maybe I should not have tried to play it GTA-style :)The progression in the game, from driving your first bus to having a lot of other drivers, different busses and lines, is very good, and the list of missions/goals keeps you motivated at all times.I definitely recommend this game for everyone who likes simulators.

												If you want a bus simulator that runs fairly well (admittedly not great and it could be improved; I have my settings on 'low' now and it works fine whilst still looking better visually than OMSI 2 does, in some ways) and is easier to use and quicker to set up than OMSI 2, then this is the one for you! It comes in at a fairly reasonable price, and it's great fun being able to operate your own business. If you can't decide whether to buy or not, I'd recommend checking out gameplay videos on YouTube.			"

												I loved it by far the best simulator for PC but what i didn't like is that when you put your company in multiplayer mode you can't get it off and you can't play unless you're on Multiplayer but i have a lot of fun with it and would definitely recommend to everyone that likes bus driving			"

												The amount of negative reviews this game has is quite annoying, as the game is definately reccomended.I bought this game after reading hate about it thinking it was going to be not the best of simulators and not what I expected, but for £18.99 this game is worth it. It is quite hard to get used to but after a bit of practice you will find it a lot of fun. I ran the game full max with no problem, my pc specs are listed on my steam page.The tutorial at the start of the game may put people off because its a silly introduction to a game but the management side of the game is really well detailed. Even though the buses aren't of the highest detail it is still a really enjoyable simulator for anyone.I find this a very enjoyable simulator, the developers have really gone to town with the detail of the game, which is always nice to see.This game is 100% worth it, no matter how old you are this game will definately please anyone.

												I am sad to report that this game did not work well on my computer. The frame rate is just really hard to take. A drive took almost 25 minutes when the game said it should take 5 minutes actual time.The game is well built though. If you have a massive computer with a MASSIVE graphics card and are not on MAC maybe this game is for you.Wish it was working, I love the way the game is built and how you run a tycoon.			"

												I have only put two hours into the game so far and it is very enjoyable. I am playing on an msi GeForce gaming laptop.  I was a little hesitant to purchase the game given I do not meat the minimum requirements. Despite a little lag here or there it runs great!  I do not see the issues other users are having.  The game itself is very relaxing and enjoyable.  If you like simulation games then this is the game for you.  I have gotten into a number of accidents and have curve jumped a few times but it drives great.  Word of advice though, do not let drunk passengers on haha			"

												Since the patch on March 10th, the game optimization has become much better, and will run smoothly on high end computers. I have yet to try this on a laptop, so I can't give details there. If you are looking for a decent bus simulator, and don't want OMSI, this is a good game, if you have the right computer for it. I run at 60fps, while I used to run at around 15 before the patch, recommend.			"

												Great simulator! I enjoyed the first few hours of playing Bus Simulator 16. It features a lot of controls and is very accurate, although I found the speeding tickets and the red lights a bit annoying at times, but maybe I should not have tried to play it GTA-style :)The progression in the game, from driving your first bus to having a lot of other drivers, different busses and lines, is very good, and the list of missions/goals keeps you motivated at all times.I definitely recommend this game for everyone who likes simulators.

												Why was a game with potential as this has, Released in such a half done state.Pro`s:Bus company simulated, which is nice to be fair to themCash box operations can be turned on or off again a nice touchGood customizationConsPerformance, This game shouldn`t run sluggish I can run a theme park with multiple coasters, Rides, shops and 2000+ guests with very little slowdown in planet coaster but this just crawls. It also has major stability problems resulting in soft crashes near endlessly but strangely enough not in the tutorial.3D engine, One of the worst I`ve seen in a racing, SIm, motion game of any sort, Everything is flat no real sense of texture and the mirrors Omg it`s like someone is standing there holding pictures of cars taken from magazines pasted onto the mirror surface.Dont trust the pictures above to give you an idea of how it is, Once your in the game between crashes you`ll see a major diffirence. If this was like £6.99 then I could forgive it but to be the same price as Starpoint Gemini: Warlords and look, sound and function as it does is a complete insult to the customers buying it.Stay away folks or buy it very cheap if you must.

												This game is great and is the best bus simulator i have ever tried. I think that this simulator would be better if the map was bigger and maybe had an airport or something like that as i have copleted all the challenges and have unlocked all of the maps as well as having the most amount of drivers avalibe. Double decker buses would aso be great in the game. I really reccommend this as the graphics are really good and is fun with many settings to make you're bus ""yours"" and This simulator is really realistic.			"

												The concept of this game is so so so good! Really good! I really love it! But it's a shame that you guy's didn't worked on the game longer. Because this game really feels and looks like it's pre pre pre pre Alpha. This game could have been so so good. I don't understand why you guy's released it in this state. Don't you guy's see yoursel that the game isn't complete and needs so much fixing? If you guy's maybe 1 day released a big big update that the game would be fixed and all and call it bus simulator 2017 or 2018 it might be really big. This game would have been soo good if you guy's really worked on it better. This could have been so big I think. But it needs a lot of fixing and it might be to late. Because the whole map looks weird. All the buildings etc. It's really looks like mincraft buildings. The seering what is the most important is so bad as well. And the Xbox controller support has to be way better. And I really don't understand why this game that look like Mincraft gives me like 45 fps of high/medium when I can play Battlefield 1 on Ultra... So that's a big problem as well. Optimize the game. Even when I use the performance branch it doesn't help. Don't get me wrong tho. This game is/would have been so much fun if worked on correct. The idea of this game is what I can dream about. People standing in doorways, people on the bus talking, door breaking down and the city would be really nice as well if the building didn't look like monecraft.			"

												It started out ok... but I can't recommend this because of too many issues with it;- I have done everything that is needed to unlock next district but the game wont recognize that I've done that so I can't progress.- Driving with keyboard feels unnatural and aquard. - Too repetative without ANY changes at all - no matter what. Where is the different types of weather? It is always sunny... Where is the different times of the day? Always driving in daylight... Where is the different types of passangers? - When looking around with the mouse You will need a third hand to be able to steer, blink, change speed and move the mouse... NOT OK! At least there should be an automatic ""go back to default view"" after You are done looking around.Sorry - great idea but not enough in deliverance.			"

												The game is very good if you think about how easy the learning courve is plus all the details they put into it to make it realistic. It is the only city bus simulator that has similar gameplay style as ETS2 or ATS: partial arcade- partial simulation. And it is possibly the best buss driver simulater on the market.In the begining, when this game was released, I couldn't run it but alter they realeased a a performance-branch. I can say i can run it very smoothly on the lowest graphics, The game looks pretty decent  even on this graphic level. if you buy this game and you cant run it very good even on loswet graphics, then you should try the performance-branch. It is found in the  betas sections. right click the game in library, select proprieties and then go to betas tab and select it in the dropdown list.It is better then OMSI because you have a fictional city to drive in freely and make your own rutes an hire drivers.
