												Spamming one kind of unprogrammed missile/laser spam ship haphazardly across the deployment zone is a lot more effective than making a fleet with carefully arranged and instructed ships that each have their own range of roles to perform.This is not the elaborate fleet design game this is made out to be, it's just about:1) Spamming one kind of ship, and/or fighters2) Being frustrated at your ships doing incredibly stupid things that the order system doesn't provide a good solution for; a cruiser with several missile launchers might decide to make each missile launcher target a different enemy, with the result being that not a single shield is penetrated, and unless you completely disallow it from engaging fighters it will chase down any fighter it sees if the fighter is closer than any frigates or cruisers.3) Figuring out which modules are useful and which are useless. Almost all modules are near-straight downgrades of some other module.Also, this game has been left in a buggy state (better than GSB2 at least); if you try checking on another window, then go back into the game, you'll be greeted with a black screen and have to force-close; if you invade a planet in campaign mode, that planet can invade the planet your fleet just left for an automatic win (and it won't necessarily even be the same race that then owns the planet which makes no sense); and if your internet connection wavers while playing campaign mode, you'll need to do another force close.Lastly, other negative reviews cover some of the scummy things this game does, such as charging insane prices for DLC you didn't even know you didn't have (If you buy the so-called ""Complete Pack"", you're still missing $12 USD of DLC).

												GSB is basically a sandbox game where you design ships and set them to battle other fleets and watch the outcome. The idea is to create a force that can win the battle wtih minimum amount of force (resources) and with minimum amount of casualties, usually by exploting a particular enemy's formation, weapons, shields, fleet composition, and so on. You have 3 classes of ships: fighters, frigates, and cruisers. Each needs to be fitted with engine, powerplant, shield(s), armor, weapons, crew, and other equipment (scanners, jammers, and more). Different weapons have different stats. Some are good against shields, others against armor. Some cycle faster but are weaker, while others may load slowly but punch hard. Cruisers may be vulnerable to swarm of fighters getting inside its shields, while frigates are usually pounded into pieces by cruiesrs, but are usually death to frighters (if armed with the right weapons). You also control the fleet's placement on the map and can give specific orders, like ""primarily engage fighters"". There are dozens of preset scenarios (battles), 10 different races (each with unique combination of ship designs and special weapons), as well as ability to challenge other players (can you do better than my battle?) and fleet vs. fleet machups. Once you set your formation and fleet, just hit ""start the battle"" and watch your ships fight it out based on the orders you've given, to the best of their ability. As you win battles, you gain prestige points which are used to unlock more advanced equipments and ship hull designs. All in all, GSB is an interesting toy that feels at times like a huge puzzle, But it is so addictive, much like setting two ant farms together and have them fight. Give it a try, despite its two-D presentation. You may end up liking it a lot and can't stop playing.			"

												GSB is okay as a game.  However, it is not a complete game in itself.  The campaign is quite small and it does not go far enough with its technological 'skill tree' progression.The gameplay is purely strategic and very hands-off.  You build a fleet of ships, with the resources available, and you send them on their way.  You have minimal control over how battles pan out, and there is no gameplay beyond the battles.  Additionally, the interface is somewhat slow and unnecessary time consuming to navigate.The most disappointing aspect of GSB is its blatant premium content model.  After you have purchased the game, you will be required to purchase a number of nominally priced DLC packs to get the full game content.  By buying this game, you are essentially only buying part of a game.I give Gratuitous Space Battles 3/10 flaming spaceship hulls. "

												Oh god I love this game. This game's style is build and run. You design ships, pretty detailed in that. You go into battle against a fleet of enemy ships. You place your ships in a layout. You program orders. You click start. You wait. If you wipe out the enemies you win.Great game mechanics there, and a pretty extensive customization range. Didn't knew this would've been this fun.Great visuals too for a 2D game.Lots of strategies involved, and I haven't even scratched the surface yet.If what I told you is something that tickles your pickles you might want to take a look at this game.

												The number of hours I've logged in this game should give you an idea of how replayable this is IF you like this kind of game, which I obviously do :3How I would describe the game:-a couple or handful of hours of campaign, which really equates to; getting you used to the game mechanics-then you have custom campaigns, this is where all of my time has gone; the numerous combinations of ships to create your fleets are absolutely fantastic, there are tons of commands to program into the ships, tons of balancing to do while creating your ships, revisions, reasons for 'special mission' ships, and best of all you are going up against fleets created by other usersQuite obviously, I recommend this, but only for the people who love strategy (and the weapons/shields/ships have a very star trekky feel, which may influence some in one way or another.)

												It's hard. If there's one undeniable thing about this game, is that it's hard. Luckily, it's not ""have an actual degree in rocket science"" hard, so you'll manage. Especially since it's so beautiful (2D is really the best choice here and I love the style), you'll try and try again. The combat effects are probably the prettiest I've seen and attack ships on the shoulder of Orion didn't look as good when they were on fire. Although I wish it had some plot. Maybe one day.			"

												GSB could be a rather fun game, unfortunately it is held back by a few major flaws. First, designing a bunch of different ships with different hulls, weapons, and modules and trying to take a combined arms approach to combat to strategically win sounds great, but it's actually easier and faster to just spam a nice well rounded cruiser, meaning there's really no point in taking a significant amount of time to craft a diverse fleet. Second, during combat, you can't interact with your ships in any way, you can only watch them. So you're stuck watching a 5-10 minute slug match (on 4x speed) where you're not engaged in the game at all, and this is extremely boring.			"

												Played this one quite a bit.  I really like the concept, but the execution is just slightly lacking.  The ability to customize is fantastic, as is the ability to order around your fleets.  The problems are:   Differentiation between races and outfits is too slight.  Huge swings in stats/price could lead to things getting unbalanced (and the one race that's the most different is unbalanced), but the gear on offer is just too similar to other entries in its category (of which there aren't that many).  If you get a shield that's advertised as 'fast-recharge', but has a recharge rate just a tiny bit higher than the standard one, it's kind of disappointing.  Likewise if you switch to a new faction to discover that aside from ship classes and small passive ability, their only advantage is a single racial outfit that's (again) almost identical to the standard one.   A game that's essentially a management sim has to have decisions to make, tradeoffs between cost, power, weight, etc.  This game has those in spades, except for the problem above.  But, it also has to have careful balance, so no one linear strategy (always get the cheap/expensive stuff, just spam A, etc.) dominates.  I would assert that the game fails this second test.  Due to eccentricities in how damage is calculated, it's possible to build a 'tank' ship that's almost invulnerable to attack.  Combine that with the prevalence of (arguably) the game's best weapon, a multi-warhead missile launcher with the best range and striking power available (and because of the multiple warheads, it handily defeats the point defense system options - and did I mention missiles have infinite ammo?), and you have a recipe for an intense stalemate.  If you avoid such degenerate tactics, the game can be fun, but I would rather see exploitative things nerfed out of existence. Playing the campaign mode is the most enjoyable for me, once everything's unlocked.  But the mac version is buggy, and I've been unable to get it to work properly.  It'll play the standard campaign fine, but won't load up either of the other 2 maps.  The whole point of any TBS style 4X game (which this expansion turns it into) is the variety in the randomized map and different factions, etc., but this game comes with exactly one galaxy map to try and conquer (later patched to 3, but that's still too few, and as noted, they don't work right).  There is a user-created program that will make randomized maps, but only for the win version apparently. Oh, and lastly, combat is entirely non-interactive (you're basically watching a movie of how well your forces do), and it maxes out at 8x speed.  Fine, except that your fleets start far enough apart and often move at such glacial speeds that it takes a minute or more of staring at wallpaper peeling until they make contact.  So, I wanted to like this more than I did.  It's still good, but falls short of greatness.			"

												Forget about things like “plot” and “characters” and “worldbuilding.”  We all know the best part of sci-fi epics are the enormous fleet battles, lasers and plasma torpedoes flying everywhere.  Debris and flaming wreckage litter the battlefield as fighter pilots go on strafing runs against seemingly invincible capital ships.  This game is full of Gratuitous Space Battles.  That is also its title.This isn’t an RTS or twitchy strategy game.  No, its much more clever than that.  You actually don’t have any control over your ships once the battle begins.  Rather, you play the role of fleet admiral, designing and tweaking ship loadouts and giving formation orders before battle begins.  There’s no overarching story to follow, simply a progression of battles across beautiful space backgrounds against increasingly deadly foes.The base game ships with four playable races, each of which has their own ship designs and specialties.  These races fill all the stereotypical sci-fi roles, from bug-eyed collective to evil empire, plucky resistance to hypercapitalist federation.  There are dozens of ship modules to mix and match, trying to find the perfect combination to bring unstoppable death to your foes.  The kicker is, you have to unlock almost everything by winning battles with less than the allotted pilots.  You buy new modules, hull designs, and races with Honor, which is earned by overcoming better than even odds.  Send too many ships into a fight?  You won’t get much out of that battle.   Simply adding a new ship design or switching races gives you a totally new outlook on the same encounter.  You can run an individual battle as much as you like, tweaking and prodding your strategy into a perfected masterpiece of war.The graphics are passable, though the UI gets a little grating after a while.  Sometimes its difficult to read some of the text, even on a large monitor.  The music, likewise, is generic but fun, sweeping orchestral pieces that add drama to these largely meaningless fights.  A cool touch is the notification bar during battles, where your individual ships will let you know how their shields are doing, which decks have hull damage, and whose reactors are leaking.  This little bit of flavor is quite refreshing.The main conceit of this game is the lack of overarching strategy and story, which is refreshing at first.  There is still a sense of progression as you unlock all the options for your fleet, but eventually you’ll have all these options and nothing else to do but replay the same missions over again on a higher difficulty.  There are six DLC races that have their own personalities and additional missions, if you want more variety from the four the game ships with.  There is also a Galactic Conquest DLC mode, which gives you a map to conquer and, interestingly, pits you against other players’ fleets that they’ve uploaded.  Positech calls it “massively singleplayer”.  You’ll call it getting utterly destroyed by people who have already mastered these systems.Gratuitous Space Battles is a fun game, and there’s definitely a lot of depth here if you want to get deep into it.  I almost think I might enjoy it more if the ships were prebuilt and I just had to deploy them, rather than have to juggle placement and fleet makeup AND individual ship restrictions.  It all becomes a little overwhelming.  But its all worth it to see laser beams blow up an alien cruiser.			"

												I believe this is a good game, but I doubt it is for everyone. If you're looking for a quick strategy game, as in the action happens quickly, then this may not be for you.For every other strategy player, you might find this game enjoyable. There is a fair learning curve to start with, but then you get the hang of it, and it becomes natural to know a cruiser beam laser won't penetrate another cruiser's shield. You will find yourself designing ships that supplement each other, and maybe on a few levels sending forth fighter swarms, which actually work. Then you get to see the after action report. But if you pay attention to the battle, you won't really need it.Overall, I believe some people won't enjoy this game, but if you aren't in a rush, this is a game for you.			"

												Don't know how I feel about this game. I enjoy the building aspect but it seems like most of the modules are underperforming or completely niche when compared to the best of the best modules. The ship designs are all pretty much the same regardless of what race you are playing and the functionality of the modules acts identical with a tiny tweak here and there, but nothing game changing. The battles themselves can be fun to watch, but thats exactly it... you're just sitting there, watching and waiting for the fight to end. This can be pretty painful in matches where fights are long and drawn out. Overall, I am enjoying the game, but I honestly don't think I could reccomend it. The game runs in a 32 bit client and I am having all kinds of crashing errors and bugs when running the system on my 64bit operating system. With that kind of dating in the desing, anyone who is interested might just be better off waiting for the sequel (which is in development).			"

												Gratuitous Space Battles is an Tower defense game. It might not look like it but that's the core gameplay mechanic. You buy and equip your ships, place them and hit the start button.Now while the idea behind Gratuitous Space Battles is very intriguing it is not very well executed. Balanced fleets and balanced ships will lose out to specialized freaks of nature every time. You will quickly learn that the most efficient fleet composition is tanks, ships with no engines, no weapons, no shields, no systems other than armor, and damagers, ships with no engines,  no armor, no shields, no systems other than weapons. This min maxing system really hurts your enjoyment as every battle will quickly become the same grind.The attempt to add on a campaign mode was well intentioned but unfortunately not very well thought though.This is one of those games that you will enjoy up until the point where you figure out how the game works. Good idea, poor execution.			"

												It's not difficult to imagine that the designers of Gratuitous Space Battles are huge fans of the wargame/boardgame Star Fleet Battles. At a glance, these games seem to share many similarities.But GSB simulates a higher command level than SFB. In SFB, you're a captain of a single starship, participating in fleet skirmishes as part of a larger team. You coordinate your efforts, but each captain enjoys his own successes, and brings glory and honor to his team through personal victories or by dying honorably. In GSB, you're tasked with assembling a fleet and deploying it for scenario combat, and then... sitting around and watching the battle.To me, this is not particularly rewarding, or entertaining. It's hard not to just crank up the speed to the fastest setting and learn the outcome of each battle. I quickly lost interest after the tutorial, and went straight to the manual to confirm that you get no control of ships. It's true. Not even in online play. This seems like a missed opportunity to me. "

												Gratuitous Space Battles – look at that name, and tell me you don’t want to purchase it.  This game is very similar to the ship building and combat of Galactic Civ II.  It’s a simple but great game that can easily absorb hours and hours of your time if you like customizing ships and playing around with conditions and commands.  Certainly a niche game, but what a good niche game indeed.  I would consider it a steal at $5 or less, and an argument for it being worth $10 could easily be made.  Its lack of RPG elements, little fleet selection, and terrible DLC system should keep you from buying it at its normal price of $20 though.			"

												It's a simple game: there's a game board, a whole bunch of enemy spaceships on their side (fighters, frigates, and cruisers). and you buy spaceships to put on yours. Then you press Play, they fly to the middle, fight, and you win or lose.Like every simple game worth a damn, it's got surprising depth and takes a lifetime to master. How do you balance your fleet? How do you position them? You can custom-design your ships, tweaking their offense (missiles, photon missiles, torpedoes, beam weapons, pulse weapons), defence (shields, armour, jammers), engine speed, cost (save money to get upgrades), tactics (who do you shoot at? and with what?), etc. etc. etc.Like the name suggests, it's completely gratuitous. You can get heaps of ships on screen, shooting at each other with all their different weapons, twirling around each other in dogfights, or pounding away at each other with huge guns. Lots of gratuitous explosions and pyrotechnics. Also like the name suggests, there's heaps of sly British humour.Recommended.			"

												Never thought that creating ships to blow alien ships up for no apparent reason or logic whatsoever could be so fun! :DWhat you basically do is to design ships which, when deployed in battle, will help defeat the enemy fleet. Every victory you win will give you a credit like reward called Honour. You use this 'Honour' to buy new shiny gadgets or weapons that blaze nice looking beams of death onto your enemy.There is no actual story line. The game is basically composed of about 14 setups (counting the tutorial battle aswell as an additional 9 setups when including all the DLC's, which brings the number up to 23) which all offer a different challenge along with a certain species to go against. This means that just because your ship designs and the fleet you deployed were successful against a certain race in such a scenario, doesn't mean that you will be as successful in another scenario with a different species. Not to mention certain scenarios having something called 'Spartial Anomalies' which can affect how well/poor your ships perform in terms of their weapons and defences.There is also a multiplayer mode which tbh isnt what you actually think, it isnt a match-up with another player, see who wins and say ""HAHA YOU SUCK!"" kind of game. No, how it works, is that you mainly pick your map and make your own scenario, deploy your ships that you designed and upload them. The scenario is then uploaded to a vast list of scenarios for the community to try out. Some may even consider retaliating your challenge. However i would just recommend trying out created scenarios to try out since there is a vast list of uploads that there is only a small chance of someone actually trying it out your own.With every game however, it has its drawbacks...Not counting the DLC, you may find it fustrating when you find yourself losing and on the recieving end of super intense beams of destruction blowing your stuff to smithereens, again and again. After the battle you are shown stats which are near impossible to understand, so you may end up in a repeating scenario of losing, losing, losing, then after more losing looking at the stats in attempt to study what is wrong, make new ship designs, still lose, go back to the drawing board, still lose and then wondering why the hell you cannot win when you study the stats for almost an hour. Also without the DLC you may end up finding yourself bored with just 4 races at your disposal, one of which you cannot fight on the single player mission scenarios.As a result you may find yourself thinking that you wasted your money on a game you cannot understand and find out how little content you had. I would advice buying this game when there is some sort of sale or deal going on with this game. Buy with the DLC expansions too to give the game a little more spice to your experience with the game. That and a lot of patience with the losing and looking up for tips on certain situations and you may end up actually coming back to this every now and then.Despite these flaws, GSB is quite a fun little game to kill an hour or so...just don't expect to fall in love with all the info you are bombarded with at the end of the battle. Again i would advise getting the DLC's as they include an extra 6 races to try and mess around with and a Galactic Campaign, though i would avoid not getting to engrossed in that too much due to the Galactic Campaign having some flaws, but the rest should keep you occupied with this game for even longer.It may have moments where you say ♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME, ♥♥♥♥ ITS MECHANICS, I WANT MY MONEY BACK!, but stick to it and hopefully in the end you will be glad you bought this game along with the DLC's.Even though the game may end up annoying you with stats and at times fleets that make you think this is all impossible to understand, it can be really fun to play once you get used to it, maybe you could one day decide to play out of rage and take out your anger on a bunch of aliens who have no reason to be blown up whatsoever, except for your entertainment of zero-g fireworks and act as some sort of stress relief!7/10			"

												A couple of weeks ago I was in the mood for some strategic space combat - as I regularly am - and decided to revisit Gratuitous Space Battles. The game promises a straightforward brawl without the complications or delay presented by having any kind of story to get in the way. First, you design your ships. There's a great deal of customization options available, but many are locked when you first begin the game. In order to unlock them, you'll need to play through the missions (more of ""combat scenarios"" as there is no story behind any of them). It's rather frustrating, almost feeling like the developer decided there needed to be some sense of progression in the game since there would be no story, but I found it to simply get in the way. Once you've designed your ships, you select your scenario and plan out your ship deployment. Many times you will see the enemy deployment, but on harder difficulties the enemy deployment will be a mystery. After finalizing your deployment, you press play. And here lies the second central conceit of GSB - the battle plays out in front of you without any control. After starting the scenario, your ships fight the enemy on their own, based on the starting deployment and fairly detailed movement and targeting parameters you can give each ship in the planning phase.I've found the AI to be - at times - frustratingly stupid, which can cripple your careful deployment. There is an option to retain manual control over your ships, allowing the game to play much more like a traditional RTS, and often times I resorted to that so that I could quickly change targets as the situation warranted. This feels like a concession, though, to unhappy players, as the game is clearly designed to be played in a manner where you set up all the pieces and then see what happens when you press start.Still, with the ship design and deployment phase leading to you sitting back and watching your work unfold, it's very satisfying when everything works together just the way you envisioned it. GSB does a respectable job capturing what it would be like to be a fleet admiral who set the battle plan but had no direct control over the course of the fight (with the one caveat that the fleet admiral would be able to give orders throughout the fight as necessary).The main problem I had, though, is that it just didn't hold my interest. While the lack of any story to get in the way of the action may be appealing to some, I found that there was no real reason to keep playing. Stories allow you to become invested in the game world, to identify with a character or a faction. Sometimes the story is just the experience of having explored the map and built your bases - you've invested time and effort into the game world. Here, there is nothing even like that. Sure, there are some vague hints about the game universe in the faction descriptions, but the scenarios become a matter of simple trial and error. If one ship design doesn't work, just go back to the drawing board and pump out another design. There's no penalty if you fail, and there's no way that you can lead your navy to victory once the tide begins to turn against them...you just have to watch them die.To be fair, an expansion has been released that adds in a Galactic Conquest mode, where you actually have a persistent campaign. But I'm not going to buy an expansion for a game unless I'm interested in seeing more, and GSB wasn't compelling enough for me to want more.Also listed on my website[www.thesewall.com].			"

												Gratuitous Space Battles is a fun simple simulation game for people who spend and enjoy a little too much time in the ship builders in 4x games. While the game is very simple to jump in, there is more then enough nuance and depth to it where you can sink more time into it then you realize and be enjoying every moment of it, but due to 'fleet management' aspect it can be a little too much for those who would have trouble in the challenges, luckily those are barred off from the main game, though their version of 'galactic conquest' has many ships which have been developed by the community and can lead a person to developing new tactics and skills is sadly behind the microtransation wall. If one is to buy the game, I would recommend the complete edition as it provides everything you would need. I would recommend the game however to anyone still as it's fun to sink a few hours here and there into. and for the price I've never felt really jipped.			"

												Build your space fleet, give them orders, then sit back and watch the carnage.  This is a tactical and strategic game where you don't get direct control of your ships.  Instead, you use the parts you have unlocked to design ships that you expect will perform well against the enemies you think you will encounter.  You assign them orders to follow, like what to attack, and when to run.  It is a really fun game once you get used to the concepts.  Designing the individual ships is more than half the fun for me.  Throwing them into a fight is icing on the cake.			"

												I really love this game. It has a challenging curve, allows you to indulge your thirst for space combat and cleverness at the same time. It's all about the construction and planning. The combat itself is played out for you. The Galactic Conquest DLC is a must have, as it adds modes and extra content that really flesh out what the core game is lacking in true meat and story.			"

												This game has some mad depth. At first it appears to be nothing more than a toy program where you put up some ships on a space map and they then duke it out on their own and you watch some pretty colors and ships going up. Wrong. The rabbit hole goes way deep and after awhile you find yourself figuring out specific ship builds for specific situations and unlocking special equipment with honor points awarded for fighting against superior forces. And then you realize you can also issue some limited orders to the ships such as 'go here', 'attack this'. And suddenly you realize you are hooked and analyzing deeply those after-battle reports to see which ship and system performed well and which one did not. Also remember check out those really promising DLC:s that contain exotic enemies to fight + campaign game map.			"

												GSB is a unique take on the strategy genre. Unlike most strategy games, you don't directly control your troops (or in this case, capital ships and fighter squadrons). In fact, you have no say at all once the battle's begun, but that's not a bad thing.  The idea is that you're the ""fleet commander"" and you give your orders to whatever ships are going into battle.  The ships' captains and fighter squadron leaders are then left to make their own decisions during combat. Sometimes things don't go as intended, but that's war.You get to purchase new items for your ships with ""honor points"" (based on how few ships you needed to win a battle) and these upgrades can make a major difference.  Best of all, the game is designed with modding in mind.  You can find tons of mods already available -- many of which are based on Star Wars, Star Trek and so on -- and it's not too difficult to make your own.In closing, I'd definitely recommend buying this game. There's a demo to try, too.			"

												I've got this game from a friend. At start it was enjoyable, different parts, different maps with own drawbacks, some races to choose from, some tactics, but after a while it is getting repetitive, grinding and boring. This game has a multiplatform support and steam cards, as well as low requirements, but it is far from worth of 15 Euro. Since you can have some fun out of this, probably most with friends, this may be worth it to get it on sale or in bundle.			"

												This is definintely an interesting game. While most tower defense games let you build stuff as the battle progresses, this is the opposite where you have to set up everything beforehand and hope for the best. To be honest, it's kind of refreshing just being able to sit and relax and watch the battle play out. There's a mode where actually can take control of a ship, but doing so disallows some rewards.I certainly appreciate what they were trying to do here. I am a fan of seeing massive fleets of ships blowing stuff up in space, like a good ol' Macross Missile Massacre.While I like the brassy orchestral soundtrack idea, I feel they could use better, and more compositions. I quickly found myself switching to my music player instead.Some things could be balanced better. I haven't thoroughly explored strategies yet, but from what I played, Fighters are basically worthless. Frigates might be cool, but they have a nasty habit of dying in shockwaves, causing chain explosions in a clumped fleet. Thus, Cruisers seem to be the best bet. I'd like to see more ship classes, like the dreaded Doom Star, or even Star Fortresses and planetary defenses (Master of Orion II talk here).Quite frankly, if they somehow were to combine this game with Master of Orion II... that would be the most amazing ******* thing ever! (Granted, Master of Orion III did *something* like this, but that game as a whole needed work, badly). With some funding and shiny 3D graphics, I think they'd have something really special here.If you're on the fence, give the demo a try. It gives you a good idea of what you're in for.			"

												Spend a few hours clearing the core game missions and learning how to build ships as well as what weapon does what, then spend hours upon hours building the perfect fleet or simply unique combat situations then linking them online for other people to try! Or maybe go try them yourself! GSB is a fleet combat sim where unlike most games you dont actualy control the ships yourself, you simply design them, place them and give them order guidelines. If your the sort of person who enjoys watching the battles in civ and rts games, likes chess, or enjoys setting up armies to then see what happens in the resulting combat, check out GSB.			"

												Let's be honest: the name of this game says it all. Gratuitous Space Battles. A gratuitous amount of battles, in space. Tons of customizable options allowing for different tactics. The campaign mode keeps it interesting, especially when there are environmental factors that prevent you from using ships or abilities. Furthermore, campaign mode doesn't have a limit to how many ships you can take in to battle. Just let that sink in. Play the campaign long enough and you can drop a monster of a fleet on an unsuspecting planet. It's brutal and completely satisfying. Before you know it, you've wasted 10 hours, and you don't care, because you're about to skip sleeping to keep playing.			"

Once your fleet is deployed you can only watch the fight in a non-interactive way, speed up execution and nothing else.At the moment of this writing, price is a bit high: I would recommend waiting for a discount and then buy it if you like strategic games and if you are a patient person, because you'll end up planning and reading a lot.

												If you get this game, get the complete pack.  If you already have this game, get the Campaign module.  Without the Campaign aspect, the game is very limited and ultimatey you won't have much to do.But with the campaign, while it is VERY limited to just building fleets and maintaining them (with no other 4X concerns; all structures are pre-built in any given system), it becomes a completely different game.  Since the fleets are uploaded from players, you'll always hit new interesting configurations for specific systems; add in all the special per-system rules that you need specialized ships and the concern of maintaining supply lines for your fleets, and it becomes a pretty engrossing game that requires far more planning and leaves you with the threat that the next attacking fleet might have your number with a counter.It's not perfect; I wish there were NPC factions and such in the 4X part with persistant forces for more strategic-level planning, but none the less, I've sunk hours into Campaign long after I previously gave up on the game.  Still this is definitely got a game for people who enjoy designing ships as a central priority.  If you do, it's on my easy list.And a word on the dev pricing - that I agree on.  The fact only one of the expansions is on a reasonable DLC sale right now is lame.  $6-7 for a new faction is entirely too much and I think he'd earn more from halving the stock price and actually participating in Steam sales more.  Still a fun game, if you grab campaign with the 75% off main game.			"

												Gratuitous Space Battles is a fun little game on it's own, if a little pricey. The real fun is had in the DLC & the complete pack is worth it over the stock game, particularly the 'Galactic Conquest' mode which really makes this game a great way to burn more time than you intended...The premise is simple: chose a race, although you only have 1 of the 4 'stock' races avaialable at the start, design fighters, frigates & cruisers by taking a hull & equip it with weapons, shields, amour, engines, crew & other extras. Sounds simple. And in a word, yes it is. Except that the ultimate ship armed with more weapons than whole armies will never have enough crew or power or shields. The balance is superb. Each race even has slightly different attributes; some develop more power or have stronger hulls.You gradually unlock better equipment & so are constantly redesigning your Ship Of Ultimate Death, but the real fun is Galactic Conquest & is worth every penny. The game generates a new galaxy each new game & you have to conquer it. The game uses fleet designs submitted by players & only a few planets can build new ships. I must have redesigned ships 3 or 4 times, developed whole new strategies... It's superb. And that's still with just the stock 4 races, never mind the 5 more you can add with the DLC.You can take direct control but I enjoy the challenge of setting up my fleet & watching it go, hoping against hope I've deployed my fleet correctly. The game doesn't bother with a story mode & is better for it.It's a superbly fun RTS that is something a little different. Recommended			"

												A game well summarised by a player on its forum:""GSB is essentially a space-opera fireworks display set to music.""A delightfully entertaining indie strategy game with unique gameplay that makes it hard to pin in any particular genre.  It's definitely not RTS because you don't give any orders during combat.  The strategy of the game lies in deciding what components to fit your ships with (factoring things like cost, weight, armor, power consumption etc.), what ships your fleet will be made up of, how to spatially arrange your ships in the fleet and finally what orders to give them as they are sent to battle.  Then the player sits back and watches the lasser and missile fireworks show unfold.  There's a lot of strategic depth, but nothing by way of clickfest.The visuals, sound effects and background music are superb.  It even has surround support so you can crank up the bass channel for those lovely explosions. :)  And it's made by a guy who knows how to choose fun over realism.			"

A lot of strategies are possible with all the races and the many weapons and ship hulls available.Of course, it may not please people that want to click everywhere and give orders every seconds to their units.

												Pretty cool game. You deploy a fleet and watch what happens. You give each ship or squadron generic orders (""attack frigates"" or ""defend cruisers"") and let 'er rip. That's not the fun part.The fun part is outfitting your ships. Each ship has so much space, so many small weapon slots, etc. You have to fit each ship in your fleet with a reactor, engines, shield generators, armor, weapons... The whole deal. You can just use the pre-generated ones, but good luck advancing in the game.If all that appeals to you, try this game. I can certainly see why this wouldn't be for everyone. Some people don't want to have to design their fleet; they just want to play with it. Some people want to micro-manage their units. This game is for neither of those people.[UPDATE]Just started playing this again because I got the ""Galactic Conquest"" DLC. So now there's an actual campaign. I find that my favorite part of the game is designing my ships. actually buying/building them and deploying them is just what I do to test my designs.The addition of a campaign mode is great. It's a very simple matter of conquering planet after planet, not building buildings or starbases, but just building your ships and sending them against computer-controlled, user-designed fleets.The DLC also added a ""direct control"" option on the fleet deployment screen. So while you're deploying your fleet, you can decide that at some point during the battle you might want to issue direct commands to your ships. I've never used it, but I guess if you don't like the AI controlling your fleet, you might appreciate it.			"

												Pick this game up on a sale, it doesn't have enough content to justify its normal price tag. But when discounted, why not? You'll probably get a couple of hours fun out of it and it is very satisfying to see your fleet victorious, particularly when you're doing something stupid like taking on an enemy fleet using only a couple of cruisers or nothing but fighters and so on.

												Simple but brilliant. I can't believe I've left it until now to realise how much fun there is to be had here.Build your fleets, battles will auto-resolve (unless you take 'direct control') and then use your 'honour' payment (an amount that reduces the more units you field) to unlock new modules to fit better/different fleets.Made by one person! The sequel is now in early-alpha too.			"

Set it up and watch it go.There is a great degree of customizability and pre-battle strategy options in Gratuitous Space Battles. But what it all leads up to, the battles themselves, I actually found rather tedious. All you do is sit, watch and make assessments on how well your plan is playing out in real time. It doesn't help that the graphics are nothing special, looking like they belong in a game released a decade ago. What I heard of the soundtrack was high energy and enjoyable.What will make or break whether you dig GSB or not is how much you like managing your fleet outside of battle. There is a lot to sink your teeth into here including creating custom ship loadouts, assigning orders that prioritizes their AI actions in battle, numerous races, and unlocking new parts for your ships using ""honor"" points you get from completing missions. There is a neat system that increases honor received relative to how FEW ships you can use in battle and still win. For example, if you use a fleet costing 20K in a battle that allows a maximum of 25K you will get more honor than if you went all the way up to that 25K cap. This adds replayability, optional challenge and deeper strategy to each mission.Gratuitous Space Battles wasn't my cup of tea but it fills a small gaming niche that will surely delight some people. I suspect you'll know if you are one of those people so trust your gut on this game.			"

												Wouldn't say it's worth full price of 15$, and it's disappointing that somehow the DLC isn't cross platform while the original game is.In this game you can customize 3 classes of spaceships (fighters, frigates and cruisers) and change their weapons loadouts, armor thickness and shield strength (all about the tradeoffs). It comes with a few (10-ish) single player campaign missions and 3 races each with it's own set of ship hulls.The learning curve is there but it's not steep, you can get away with skipping the tutorial. What you do in this game is you customize your ships, and on a budget with restricted amounts of pilots you deploy them into pre-determined battlezones, you customize the AI a little and then watch the battle ensue. You cannot manually control or micromanage ships while the battle is on-going, you must decide it all before the battle.It's a unique but cool take on real time strategy. In space. You can expect to get anywhere between 3-10 hours from it depending on how fast you catch on to techniques for easy victories, and how much time you spend customizing your ships. For me, as soon as I'd unlocked all the modules and finished all the campaign missions, it was over. There wasn't even any lore to get into. I didn't have any interest in online play either.Overall it was a decent and fun game, but I found it lacking in content (both mission quantity and amount of things to do for honor points. Once you've unlocked everything, there's no reward for winning battles any longer), not quite worth a 15$, but if you catch it on sale, it's worth at least one playthrough :)			"

												Build spaceships and send them into unconnected battle scenarios. Win the battle and get some money to unlock factions, hulls and equipment.  Since you just watch the battle unfold, The game is in the ship designing and pre-battle planning stage. Watching the battles can be fun, But lack of an overall campaign would help give more meaning to the scenarios.I played thru 6 out 12 scenarios using the tutorial ships given to you at the beginning of the game. So, I never felt the need to design my own ships.  I'll stop here, File it under Play Again? And look into the campaign game expansion. Or wait for Gratuitous Space Battles 2.			"

												By far the worst thing about this game is the way the developer tried to nickel-and-dime (or five-dollar-bill) us to death with minor, overpriced expansion packs that you pretty much needed to get if you wanted to keep participating in all the community had to offer.

I got a bad enough taste in my mouth with how he handled the first one (if you bought every pack you'd end up paying like $15 for the base game + $42 for the DLC, so basically $57 for a game that is worth maybe $20 all total, relative to other Steam offerings.

												Gratuitous Space battles is one of the best fleet-based game I have ever played. The battles themselves are entertaining enough. But the core of GSB is ship design.

												GSB is the kind of game I like; you can jump in, have some fun whenever free time presents itself. While the game is rich in detail and strategy, it gets boring fairly fast. I find myself frustrated with some of the confines it presents for the actual battles. I would love the ability to create my own battles in detail and alter tactics as the battle unfolds. The developer has unfortunately made it impossible to do these things and requires you to replay only the battles it created and you also have to anticipate your outcome ahead of the battle by telling your fleet what to do before the battle begins. Without the ability to reinforce teams or reassign ships you end up losing a battle because your good ships are flying in circles far away instead of helping out damaged allies.Ultimately GSB is a fun game and the price is right to recommend, however I would like to see some love from the devs in further development and expansion packs.

												Closest Similar Genre is Tower-Defense Games.All you do is: you place Weapons and Equipment on Ships then place the ships on the Battlefield.The Battle plays out without *any* input from you ,with the enemy ships always flying straight for the nearest Target .Can be easily won by droppping a cheap Bait in one Corner,all your armed Ships in the other.Pro:+ Prettiest *2D* Space Battles i have seen so far.Cons:----  ""Game"" is undemanding, Automatic,lacking Setting/Atmosphere/Story.

												Honestly, I DESPISE space games. But when I began playing this game, I actually came to like/slightly love it.Basically you can customize your fleet with diff weapons/engines/etc, and then place different units on your side of the battlefield.  Then you click ""run""or whatever it is, and your ships battle with the AI's(in story mode at least). Watch you ships get demoished or watch your ships dominate the AI's.I personally have not come across any bugs or errors.But still, decently fun/good game. Was waaaay different than what I had expected, but even so, I still like this game.8.75/10, 4.25/5 stars.			"

												While initially a game that takes the best parts of the Master of Orion series, namely the ship design and combat sequences, sounds like a great idea on paper, it’s a tricky thing to implement well. Gratuitous Space Battles does the ship designing component admirably and while I can understand and appreciate the player not being able to micro-manage the battle (you are a ship designer after all) the game is unfortunately less fun. This is exacerbated by the fact that when losing a battle it’s not terribly clear why, even with pie charts staring at you in the face. 5/10			"

												This is a great game.Gratuitous Space Battles is not like your typical RTS fare.  Instead of manually controlling all of your units and furiously managing your economy, you design your units (space ships in this case) and define certain characteristics of how they should perform in battle (distance to maintain from enemies, formations, some AI behaviors) and then let the battles play out.  You can't control anything during the actual battles.  This game is all about planning and strategizing, and there's a lot to offer.  What I believe is the key difference that makes this game great is its emphasis on overall strategy rather than micromanaging an absurd level of detail.  Yes, a bit of micromanaging would make the battles easier, but it's your plans and strategies that will win the day rather than your ability to build structures really fast.  Prepare to think.			"

												A very tentative yes....if you are on a budget I would avoid this game. It is fun to a point but the customization and strategy is very slim. If you enjoy slapping guns on things and watching them blow up other things then by all means get it. This game lacks so much that it feels like a vanilla game. It is hardly worth the price and the DLC is outrageously overpriced for what you get. So yes I recommend this game if you like casual games with not a whole lot of depth...I would also recommend that the creators of this game offer free DLC from now on to make up for ripping people off with price gauging and false advertising.

												I could never get the hang of this. The name implies everything. You build a space fleet, arm it to the teeth, then send it out. Preferably to space. For a battle. A space battle. Gratuitous. This is the game that a Warhammer 40K fan would love. You lovingly and merticulously paint each and every piece you have, and after about 5-6 hours, you finally get to the action. It's a little too deep for my tastes. I'm too simple.			"

												This game does exactly what it says on the tin. It has lots of battles. And they're in space. And they're completely gratuitous. No plot or characterisation to get in the way. Just lots of lasers and explosions.The ships are beautifully designed. The graphics and special effects are glorious. And while the sound effects are a bit quiet compared to the rest of the game, especially when zoomed out (which is also not that good - not possible get the entire map into view), they are still as epic as you'd expect building-sized missiles and highway-thick lasers to sound.That said, this game is not without its flaws. The zoom function, I've already mentioned - sometimes, you want to get an entire battle into view, just to see the sheer scope of things. Not possible, however. Fighters have little love in this game, having the smallest amount of customisation options. It is also quite easy to unlock everything, myself having done so after the first eight or so battles.I've read some of the other reviews. They complain that despite the vast amounts of customisation, the battles are not conducive to that, instead forcing players to stick to the same narrow tactics, strategies and loadouts, in order to win. This is not true. Admittedly, it is possible to win that way. However, the real difficulty in the game is abandoning your OP strategy, and trying to win with your favourites, rather than the ""proper way"". Is it difficult? Yes. Is it frustrating? Yes. But, that is half the fun of the game.Other people are giving negative reviews, because they missed the point of the game entirely. They were expecting an RTS, and what they got was something completely different. You are not a fleet admiral. You are not on the battlefield, commanding your ships. (Well, unless you select the 'direct control' button). What you are, is the guy on the space station, outfitting your faction's ships before the battle, then giving orders to the captains of said ships. You are the guy whose job it is to make sure as many of your guys come back. And doing it within a budget.As to the people who complain about the cost of the DLCs. So what? You don't have to buy them. And if you paid attention to the developer's website, you'd know that the price is due to the cost of getting the new ships designed - The developer does not create ships himself, instead hiring a 3d designer from out of house, and contracting it to him.One nitpick I do have though, is that the 'Complete Pack' on Steam is anything but, since it does not include the Parasite or Outcast factions.In conclusion, a beautiful game, with some flaws, but nothing that should put you off getting it. I've had hours of fun with this game, and it has infinite replayability.			"

												This game combines 2 of 3 elements a good game should have: gameplay and freedom (ship with no engines? here you go! ship with no offensive capabilites, made only to help other ships? as you wish!). Unfortunately, there is no plot (at least without the DLCs), therefore after some time it simply becomes repetitive. The basic four races are good enough for the first play-through, and thousands of possible ship configurations should not to ignored.Finally, despite deceptively simple graphics, the battles are somehow incredibly satisfying to watch, and possibility of speeding up or slowing down the play speed is awesome!

												An enjoyable strategy romp featuring multiship spacebattles and poping destruction eye candy. The layers of planning and countless combinations of ships and equipment are very deep.The learning curve can be a bit steep though, and if you are a hands on type of player you may be dissapointed as there is little to no interaction to be had once battle starts.

												In Gratuitous Space Battles, the player is allowed to design ships with various elements, arrange them on a grid prior to battle, and provide each ship with preset orders. That's it. You are not allowed to participate in anything else. There are many unlockables and such, but this does very little to make the bare bones game enjoyable. There is no storyline, nor a campaign of any description. The game provides the player with so-called scenarios, and all that means is that the developers arranged the enemy ships in a grid. Once again, that's it. There is not much else besides that. You may also unlock a few other races, and each race has about a dozen ""scenarios"" (if I can even continue to refer to them as such). Each component that could be equipped for each of your ships has different descriptions , but they do not impact the overall performance of the ships in any significant way, nor do they alter the player's overall game play experience. Each and every time you go into battle, is almost a near perfect repetition of the last attempt, with very little variation, if any at all. Each of the races do not provide the player with true alternatives in order for them to actually be considered unique or different from each other. There is absolutely no action, nor climax in any of the battle instances you may go through as you play the game. It is like watching a limited and basic screen saver, over and over again, with very subtle differences each time. Even if you unlock all the hulls/components and implement them in ship design, there is barely any noticeable performance difference in the battles. It is as if nothing changes. In addition, the game does not inform nor hint at the effectiveness of any of the components you will have available to equip your ships. The AI is also comparable to that of a screen saver, in every describable way. There also appears to be no sound effects whatsoever, besides the ever repeating music. A representative from the developer named ""cliffski"" can be found in the Gratuitous Space Battles Steam forums being arrogant, pompous, and rude towards others who have a negative opinion about the game. At the time of this writing, the developers are asking for $20 for the game, and an additional $37 for six DLCs. There is basically very little content here, for an irregular and exorbitant amount of money. I have never come across such an exaggerated difference between content and pricing prior to this shameful release. This is completely unacceptable and despicable, and developers such as these should not be supported in any way, shape, or form. It is with releases such as Gratuitous Space Battles that we see proof of very low quality and very low content getting worse and worse. This game is comparable to adjusting the settings of a screen saver, then watching it run. There is very little actual game play to be found in Gratuitous Space Battles. If you like screen savers, you may want to give this displeasing, limited, uncreative, and meager attempt at a game a try. While the idea is interesting, the overall execution is nearly anti-game. The premise furnishes a false sense of choice over your ship designs, when in reality, there is little strategy as this is more of an actual screensaver. Despite many alterations to your designs, the results will be very similar. I hope you have a CRT monitor so that this glorified and expensive screen saver could actually become useful.Gratuitous Space Battles is mediocre.			"

												As a standalone game (without DLC), Gratuitous Space Battles is mostly just an excercise in optimization - it isn't especially difficult to beat most of the missions with a generic all-around fleet, but you are only really rewarded for doing it with the least amount of cash.The issue is, the feedback on how well you are doing is... lacking. There isn't a sandbox mode to quickly test fleets against each other, the after-battle graphs are impenetrably thick and there's no explanation I found for what ""most effective"" means, especially considering different weapons will have different uses (e.g. anti-fighter versus anti-shield versus anti-hull). It's frankly a bit more of a mess than it needs to be.			"

												Taking the time to build your ships and plan you strategy can be fun, but as soon as you're ready for the exciting part, all control is taken away.  You are unable to participate other than simply watching the battle play out.Even worse, once you've got strategies that work for you, the best thing to do is save them to reuse later.  While that cuts down on the tedium of rebuilding the same thing over and over, it effectively removes one of the few things you still had control over.Combine that with the lack of any story to keep your interest, and this game grows boring in a hurry.  Try a more active and engaging game like ""FTL: Faster Than Light"" instead.			"

												Anyone who has seen George Lucas' magnum opus to mediocrity, the Star Wars pre-quels, will sympathise with this game. In the Star Wars pre-quels, the future-emperor Palpatine conducts endless yawn-inducing political machinations around the Imperial Senate while the Jedi conduct equally pointless and only mildly more interesting aggressive negotiations. All this banality is interspersed with serial idiot Jar-Jar Binks perpetrating his unique brand of aggressive stupidity with criminally negligent fervour. Cut to the gratuitous space battles already.With the focus on space battles, GSB has dispensed with fatuous back stories. You basically get a bunch of space ships and attack another bunch of space ships. Aside from tweaking the loadouts on the ships that's essentially it. It does get repetitive but the space combat is well implemented with a visually mesmerising myriad of missles, torpedoes, lasers and other weapons-of-death. There's nothing but gratuitous grandiose space battles and everyone is better off for it.			"

												Trash. There are like ten (yes, you read correctly) missions in the game. Moreover they are way too easy. Beside that, gameplay suckz too. You make the initial deployment of your ship and that's it. Once the battle start you can't do anything. I just click fast forward a wait for the end. Zero interaction. The customization of your ships should be selling point of this game. You have several ship blueprints and like billions of modules. Making of your own spacecraft sucks. Don't get me wrong, i like customization, but here you quickly notice, that you can just build cruisers with tons of shields and torpedos and forget everything else.Verdict: Avoid.			"

												A little late to the party, but it happens.  GSB is a blast to play, and I'm a big fan of any strategy or sim games--particularly those that reward careful planning and creativity.  This game is centered around building a fleet and laying out a battle plan; the battles play out according to decisions made prior to the battle.  A 'direct control' option is available to enable RTS-style control during battles, but this feels tacked on and the game shines when one avoids this option altogether.GSB gives me the impression of building model space-ships from a box of purchased parts and then letting those toy ships destroy each other.  Add in the mix of battling other peoples' fleets via downloadable challenges and a campaign system, and it's the ultimate nerdy space wars game.

												Gratuitous Space Battles is a Pre-planning RTS game where you get to make your own units and make them face the ultimate challenge, blowing the other fleet up. There is no story, plot, or anything like that. There are no politics, and there is absolutely no diplomacy. There is only war, gratuitous war. Btw, it's kinda like Michael Bay made a space combat game. So, let's get to the review.Pros:- Graphics are amazing. From the debris to the freaking ship models, they all look great.- Special effects are also amazing. Every little explosion just makes you jump in satisfaction as your enemies ships go down in an explosion so intense it damages other starships.- Variety of the races and startships are also great. Every race and every ship in these races have strengths and weaknesses.- There are only three classes of ship, but the variety is enormous.- The unit building is spot on, you can customize your ship to be really fast or have weapons so powerful you can almost one-shot kill other starships.- There is a distinct difference between armor and shields.- You just have to watch the destruction unfold as the some-what decent AI controlling the ships make their moves.\- There is a slight bit of humor and slightly racist jokes, but they are pointed towards aliens.Cons:- The only strategy in this game is planning ahead of time what your units orders are, meaning that you literally have to watch the battles unfold as you are sitting in your chair waiting for something to happen.- Only three classes of ship to choose from.- It's from the 2d perspective. If they made it 3d, I would rate it a lot higher.- Some classes of ship are almost impossible to customize, like the imperial Gun station.- For some reason shields don't come back up after they are depleted.- Some of the ships seem too slow, like the cruisers. you would think that something big in space would still be able to travel fast.- Get's repetitive really fast, but you have to admit some of you had that thought of 'maybe one more battle'.- The fact that a squadron of fighters takes 3 frigates to take down, no matter how many anti-fighter weapons you have on them.- Why does armor have such low health? Isn't armor supposed to help absorb damage taken to the hull rather than be blasted away like it was nothing?- The DLC's only add races and weapons that can only be used by the race you bought them with.- Maps are literally the same, except for some debuffs in some of them. The only major difference is the background.- Some ships are only slightly different from other ships. Some of the modules are also only slightly different.Overall, it is a decent game that isn't really worth the $15 that it is now. Get it on a sale and try it out. If you love space battles and massive explosioins, you would love this game. If you like plot and story to a game, don't get this game.I rate this a 7/10 (Decent game). If they added a bit more of a difference between the ships and modules, and they had it 3d, and they added twitch decision making the rating would be much higher.			"

												This game is... simple. That's the only way to describe it. They say this is a ""heavy strategy"" game, but I honestly see no strategy. It's a space-simulation, automatic ship-control, arcade game, but I guess ""Strategy"" fits on a box. Unless you watch the videos and for some reason like it, I say don't buy.			"

												Part strategy, part creativity, this game puts a unique spin on space combat.  Though it requires some time to get the feel of, I find it enjoyable watching one's creations race into battle!  I highly recommend picking this game up with the expansions, as they add another dimension to the game.

												You build a fleet and then watch it fight another fleet. It's less about space battles and more about micromanaging what ships a fleet has and what each ship is equiped with. If you're into micromanaging and not actually playing space battles then you may enjoy this.It's like Star Trek. But instead of being the captain of your own ship you're star fleet's accountant allocating resorces to various encounters but never really taking part in them.			"

												This game is great in all practical aspects. To sum up, you take pre-made ships and put stuff on them. Then you send them into combat and (hopefully) win, which gives you some credits. Just sitting back and watching your ships in combat is quite fun.Now to move on to an impractical aspect which I dislike, modding. Once you understand the basics it is quite fun to make new weapons that can destroy a hard battlefleet in seconds. Why I don't like it: aftermath.

												This game is fun, but not worth what they are charging now.  Thankfully I got it on sale for like 5 bucks, and the DLC was very cheap too.  Now it's too much for the very little content you get.  I do however like how you can go into the data folder and add in new stuff like hulls and modules with custom stats.

												While the concept is pretty good, and some of the crewmember lines are good, this is a fatally flawed game. The UI is horrible, forcing you to delete ship designs after customising them for each mission. There is also no way to rebind keys, which is especially a problem since the up key moves the view up and zooms in a the same time, which is incredibly frustrating. Worse, the linux version will do everything it can to prevent you from changing windows while playing, making you close the game every time you get an email.			"

												To much long-term planning for my tastes. The main game loop involves you designing ships, deciding which ones to deploy, then assigning orders. Then you just wait and see if it works. If it doesn't work, then you have to try to figure out what went wrong and how to win. I just find that loop to not be very engaging and be more mentally exhausting than stimulating. The amount of thinking about tradeoffs and all the decisions the game wants you to make are more stressful than fun - it's pretty much everything I don't want to do in my free time (it's the same sort of mental exhaustion I encounter at work).

												I never thought that a game with such a premise and name would be so dreadfully boring. The idea of watching a bunch of spaceships you control blow up other spaceships is great. Except you don't control them at all. You set them up and watch the fight afterwards. There are fast forward buttons, but you have absolutely no control during the battle at all. Granted, there is an enormous amount of mechanical detail where you can arrange the formation, AI, weapons, and armor of the ships but the end result is still setting up all your toy soldiers to watch them fall down.Definate pass.

												Overall, 7/10. A game of little depth or complexity, but enough spread and slight innovation to keep one going. See below for in depth review.So I downloded this game years ago from it's official site and was excited to see it on Steam. Unfortunatly I forgot how powerful nostalgia was. This is a great game for kids, a kind of ""baby's first space war,"" but not for a seasoned gamer, or even a casual one above the age of fifteen. As the description boasts, there is no backstory, there is no diplomacy, and there is no base-management. What it fails to mention is that it did not add anything in to make up for those deficiencies. The game consists merely of building ships, that is, placing weapons and support modules on pre-constructed hulls, and hurling them at each other. Once you put the ships on the battlefield and click play, cross your fingers and pray, because you can't manipulate your ships AT ALL once the battle starts. That seems like a pretty big issue to me. But then again, it's all just one gratuituous space battle. Each battle is identical, with just a little environmental variation and change of enemy to make it look other wise. Ship building is alright. Don't try and specialize. There are modules to heal yourself, heal others, heal fighters, stop missiles, free enemies. Don't. Anything not packing the max amount of weapons and shields will be destroyed very quickly. It's not a well-balanced game. If you want a real space RTS, look up Battlefleet Gothic: Armada.			"

												In Gratuitous Space Battles, you construct a financially-feasible fleet with what begins as a limited amount of components. You then place your fleet in whatever formation you want, press ‘go’ and watch the space battle unfold. The battle can take a while but you can fast-forward it through it to the result (which is mostly losing it until you figure out a good fleet design).  Graphically the game isn’t very impressive. In fact, the game isn’t very impressive at all. If you’re into spaceship engineering, then this is the game for you. If you’re a bit more into the actually battle part of space battle, then you might find this game a little gratuitous.For full review, visit:http://icarusreviews.net/2013/07/30/brief-write-of-a-brief-flight-gratuitous-space-battles/ "

												I played this game a lot in the past, and now I am coming back to it here on Steam.I always loved to fit my ships on Eve Online, trying to find the best configuration for my modules. Well, Gratuitous Space Battles is all about doing experiments with your ships, and sending them to try to blow the enemy in pieces. Forget about all the micro and macro management of huge empires. Forget about diplomacy. Forget about stressfull RTS  orders. After the strategic deployment, sit and watch gorgeous space combats, with lot of lasers, missiles, plasmas and tons of debries all around the beautiful 2D battlefields.I highly recommend this game for players who likes strategy games and also for trekkie fans ;) "

												I rather enjoyed this game, even though I beat all the single player maps on normal difficulty in 2 hours.  The basic idea is that you place ""devices & weapons"" in empty spaces when you build/setup a spaceship.  Then you place them in formation.  Once you go into battle, you cannot really do much other than watch your ships fight.  Its pretty cool when you make a super cruiser to mass destroy the enemies.The fewer ships, devices, and cost... the better score you get.  With the better score (honor) you can buy new parts and ship designs.  It has depth to likely get a good 10-15 hours of uprading, battles, building, and showing off online.Nice game for what it is!  I liked it a lot but overall it has less control during combat than I would like.  Even if all I had was a little tiny lame shooter ship, Id like something.			"

												It takes some of the best elements of galactic space battles and focuses on them. IE: ship building and combat. However, visually its all 2-2.5D. Ship designs aren't all super looking. Designs from Pax Imperia ED, while older, actually look a lot better than these. However, its still decent and a good buy whenever this game is on sale.			"

												Pick a scenario, build an armada of customised ships, position them. Give them tactics. Then hit 'go' and watch how the scenario plays out.It's fun and challenging, there are dozens of different ways to win each battle and while randomness does play a part, the biggest element is how you've built and tweaked each ship and what tactical commands you've given them. Because once you hit go, no further commands can be given and you just have to watch it all play out.All the DLC is solid and each pack adds new factions, weapons and equipment. It's fun.			"

												Gratuitous Space Battles is a very complicated tactics game. It allows you to create your own ships and set commands for them and ,instead of you having to manage all your ships, you just get to sit back and enjoy your fleet blasting your opponents into intergalatic space dust. The game is extremely addictive because it makes you strive to create the unstoppable fleet, and once you get there you always realize that you could do something else to make it even more amazing. Small tweaks can change entire battles. Adding or taking away ships or weapons can mean life or death. If you spent more money on shields you could last longer but you might have a cheaper engine. These things have to be accounted for when playing.Pros: Addictive gameplay, endless amounts of customization,  online battles, wonderful graphics, and countless other features.Cons: Price (its pretty expensive for what it is), online could be better, High learning curve.

												Gratuitous Space Battles is a fun game and an interesting idea. It takes the fun of strategic space battles but takes away all the fluff of resource gathering, story, characters, etc. I really enjoyed playing it but the novelty wears off after a few hours. The built-in scenarios can be beaten very quickly and with very little modification to the tutorial ships. The rest is just a playground where you try making your own ships and pitting them against the fleets of other players. Fun...but eventually grows dull. Ship designs begin to feel the same and finding that perfect combination of weapons, engines, and crew becomes a chore. In conclusion, it's fun for a while but eventually leaves you wanting more.

												Fun game.  A little rough to get started and definitely not a simple ""plug in and play"" type of game.  There are so many variables, tactics, and strategies that it can be overwhelming.  I am disappointed at the lack of steam achievements or even in-game achievements.  However, for a foundational game is great with a wonderful premise.  To me, this game encourages me more to buy and play Grauitous Space Battles 2 than to spend more time to play this one.SO I recommend this game but for most people you should likely wait and play the sequel in the series.-Chaos			"

												This game has a lot going for it, you want a ship with a mix of weapons, you have it. You want a ship with all armor and shields with only one weapon to stalemate every fight, you have it. The possibilities are vast. Another thing that makes the game great is how easy it is to mod. In the first week of playing this I had designed my own modules, modified the ships to be more distinct, and not long after I was adding my own hulls and sounds.My only issue with this game is how you have to buy the game twice for all of the content. It doesn't feel worth it, especially since I see how blatantly easy it is to add things to the game. Entirely new races can be scripted in a month I'm sure, the only thing I could see taking time is the artwork for the ships, which had to stay in the consistant art style of the base game. That's not to say it can't be done, because I've drawn my own ships in a few hours, but I digress. I will pay for the sequel, but not for any DLC unless it's all bundled with a complete pack, as I was peeved after buying the ""full"" bundle and learning two of the DLC aren't included.			"

I still keep it installed because I still enjoy it.Space fantasty mixed perfectly with strategy.All the lasers, beams, missles, decoys, sub-systems, and all the giant, slow-moving, death-dealing ships you could possibly want to create thrown into a game where you can pit them against a challenging AI that will have you going back to the drawing board to rethink your strategies again and again.I've reformatted my computer twice since I got this game and it was among the first to be reinstalled each time.

												This game is pretty great. You design spaceships, set up your fleet, then watch them fight the enemy. There's a lot of information available to you if you want to get deeply involved with the numbers, but it doesn't penalise you too much for just trying ♥♥♥♥ out and seeing what happens.Back when I used to play Magic: the Gathering, building the deck was my favourite part of the game, the actual playing bit wasn't nearly as good. It's just what you have to do to see how good your deck-building was. And this game seems to be designed specifically for people like me. It's all setup. Once you've desined your ships and put together your fleet, you just watch them fight it out with the enemy.And then when it's over you get some detailed information on what you did wrong and get to try again. It's great.			"

												Start with a number of blank ship types. Add your own shields, armour and offensive weapons and then pit them against other massive fleets of ships. Like most good ideas, sounds simple but there's so much variation to be had that it'll keep you searching for the magical balance between something that can soak up damage whilst being able to dish it out. The recent DLC added a really cool compaign mode which adds a bit of structure and continuity to the battles. All in all, a really good game if you enjoy a bit of slow burning strategy.

The battle can take a while but you can fast-forward it through it to the result (which is mostly losing it until you figure out a good fleet design).  Graphically the game isn’t very impressive. In fact, the game isn’t very impressive at all. If you’re into spaceship engineering, then this is the game for you. If you’re a bit more into the actually battle part of space battle, then you might find this game a little gratuitous.For full review, visit:http://icarusreviews.net/2013/07/30/brief-write-of-a-brief-flight-gratuitous-space-battles/ "

												I know any game has a learning curve where you figure out the pattern, and enjoy the game. I have been unable to figure out why I should fiddle with setting x or y on the ships to win a battle. If they're not working in the first place, something's defective. Shuffling the ships around and waiting to see them all obliterated based on how I shuffled them isn't particularly gratifying. Apparently I spent all my money losing, and now have to figure out, on the normal difficulty, how to face giant space fleets of perfect ships with perfect shields with only 3 cruisers and a handful of smaller ships which explode in short order. Sorry I wasted my money on it. I have absolutely no interest in finding out what custom ship I need to design to win. Best way to win with Gratuitous Space Battles is to delete local content.			"

												GSB is a game where you command a fleet of spaceships of the faction of your choosing that you have built yourself, There are scenarios that serve as a campaign. By winning battles you earn credits to further upgrade your arsenal and new factions. The battles play out by themself with just a slight player imput of commands. You set orders and formations prior to a battle and hope your stratagy will get you thru. This game has many DLC that offer additional races/factions, but the one i trully reccomend is the galactic conquest one wich adds an epic campaign where you manage planets and resources.If you are a fan of the Sci Fi genre and like strategic games you will love GSB.

												so, GSB on its own is ok, but quikly it gets old due to lack of missions and races. What I found makes this game amazing is its modiblily.

The most notable mods are the UNI-T and Preatorian industries mods, which add countless new ships as well as lenghthy, conected campaigns.

												Space, the final frontier. It is large void, which is largely unexciting, except for the occasional contact with a third-kind.Unsurprisingly, games based on space settings are hyper-efficient in capturing the unexciting parts of space, either forcing players to explore large areas, or to establish themselves on planetary systems for hours on end, before finally getting to the more exciting parts. Gratuitous Space Battles (GSB) threw out these nonsense, with no empire building, no resource hunting and no aimless exploring. Instead, GSB throw players right into the fray of combat. Even though battles are auto-resolved, with players able to zoom in and out of the autoplay actions, players can test out their hands on ship design and battle instructions to refine their strategy further, in hope of eliminating the opposing force, while using the least amount of resources (money) given. Not a AAA title, GSB still manage to give a new breathe of air in removing the boring bits of space.			"

												Be warned that the Galactic Conquest expansion, what could have been the capstone to the game (as it actually adds a campaign functionality that should have been in to begin with), REQUIRES an internet connection. Without that, the game is nothing more than a few dozen 'scenarios' (pre-established enemy groupings) that, while fun on the first or second completions, rapidly grow into tedium. There is no metagame beyond the campaign, and unless you're able to maintain an internet connection (and, more to the point, don't have any better games to play online than this glorified tower defense game), that functionality is locked out to you... and costs extra, to boot.

												Excelente jogo de estratégia de ""Navinhas"", lembra um pouco Robocode, para quem nunca ouviu falar: é um jogo da IBM com fins educativos para ajudar a ensinar programação em Java.Da mesma forma, você deve projetar e elaborar a formação, as armas, configurar a estrutura de cada Nave em campo de combate e adicionar o comportamento de cada uma delas. Após isso é só começar o combate. Durante o combate você pode aplicar ordens por cima da IA já preparada por você, tornando a estratégia o ponto forte do jogo. Bom, o objetivo do jogo é simples, progredir  nas batalhas, enfrentando oponentes cada vez mais complexos, que obriga o jogador a elaborar estratégias diferentes. O jogador pode publicar Challengers para outros jogadores, assim não apenas existem as missões tradicionais, mas também desafios de outros players pela net, que podem te entreter por horas.Por fim, se você curte muito estratégia+navinhas, este é definitivamente seu jogo.Wyl Magazine Nota: 8.3/10			"

												Gratuitous Space Battles is a fun game and an interesting idea. It takes the fun of strategic space battles but takes away all the fluff of resource gathering, story, characters, etc. I really enjoyed playing it but the novelty wears off after a few hours. The built-in scenarios can be beaten very quickly and with very little modification to the tutorial ships. The rest is just a playground where you try making your own ships and pitting them against the fleets of other players. Fun...but eventually grows dull. Ship designs begin to feel the same and finding that perfect combination of weapons, engines, and crew becomes a chore. In conclusion, it's fun for a while but eventually leaves you wanting more.

												This game is pretty great. You design spaceships, set up your fleet, then watch them fight the enemy. There's a lot of information available to you if you want to get deeply involved with the numbers, but it doesn't penalise you too much for just trying ♥♥♥♥ out and seeing what happens.Back when I used to play Magic: the Gathering, building the deck was my favourite part of the game, the actual playing bit wasn't nearly as good. It's just what you have to do to see how good your deck-building was. And this game seems to be designed specifically for people like me. It's all setup. Once you've desined your ships and put together your fleet, you just watch them fight it out with the enemy.And then when it's over you get some detailed information on what you did wrong and get to try again.

												Gratuitous Space Battles lives up to it's name. All you do is build ships, prep for battle and see how long it takes to destroy your enemy. It's fun, full of sacrasm and non-stop action. However, it can get tiresome after awhile.			"

												The campaign DLC is a must have. Online challenges are fun and player designed. No control of the ship in combat: plan in advance accordingly.			"

												This doesn't require too much skill, it mostly requires Customising ships to suit the battlefield/situation. Then Doing it all over again, slightly tedious. However, it does look cool .... Only Thing going for it though.			"

												Game is very fun, has alot to play around with when it comes to ship designs. For me it was easy purchase because I like the developer and his other games.			"

												Spend hours designing space ships, then release them in waves to battle other people's space ships!(P.S. It is now 4am and you forgot to go to sleep.)			"

												The Serious Sam of space battle games - you don't need a reason to throw huge battle fleets at one another and enjoy the resulting carnage. Best of all, battles don't take all day, so it's a great 'casual' game. Beautifully made and with heaps of DLC, it's one you'll keep coming to.			"

												Pretty fun game. Its a strategic game where you design your own ships and position the ships before the battle. Then you press play and watch the show. The game is pretty forgiving as once you lose, you can always just start the battle again.  The game also shows detailed statistics after each battle so you can tell where your plan went awry. Frankly I just liked to spam fighters and watch them swarm everything. There is a lot of dlc for the game, but I haven't tried any of it yet.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine Gratuitous Space Battles is a game developed by Positech Games, the same people behind the Democracy seriesIn Gratuitous Space Battles you fight in space trying to survive the onslaught of enemies heading your way. The game's style is that of build and run, which is; you design ships, you go into battle against a fleet of enemy ships, you place your ships in a layout, you program orders, you click 'Start' and you wait. If you wipe out the enemies, you win!There is a set amount of great game mechanics there, and a pretty extensive customization range. The game also offers great visuals too, especially for a 2D game and there is a lot of strategy involved when planning your attackGratuitous Space Battles is a fun game to play in short bursts! RECOMMENDED :)  "

												This game is FUN and ADDICTIVE.Essentally, you play the role of a SPACESHIP ENGINEER - You create ships and then watch them fight. The learning curb takes about an hour, so not bad. At first I was like: ""Wow, I lost, awesome, I need to fine-tune my ships."" And then I lost a bunch more, and still I thought it was a good challenge. Then I still kept on losing to literally level 1. Then I realized: my cruisors needed to be decked out with long range high speed plasma torpedos. Once those were installed I cleaned house. And if your crusiors just have these weapons, then make sure to support them with lazer frigits. Played all night and has been a lot of fun.			"

												I played this game a lot in the past, and now I am coming back to it here on Steam.I always loved to fit my ships on Eve Online, trying to find the best configuration for my modules. Well, Gratuitous Space Battles is all about doing experiments with your ships, and sending them to try to blow the enemy in pieces. Forget about all the micro and macro management of huge empires. Forget about diplomacy. Forget about stressfull RTS  orders. After the strategic deployment, sit and watch gorgeous space combats, with lot of lasers, missiles, plasmas and tons of debries all around the beautiful 2D battlefields.I highly recommend this game for players who likes strategy games and also for trekkie fans ;) "

												Perhaps not for everyone, this game will appeal to those who love tweaking stats, strategic planning, and watching (large emphasis on *watching*) spaceships pound each other into debris for hours on end. Try the demo first.			"

												More fighters then the battle of endor, beter explosions then battle star galactica, Bigger ships then startrek.  Move over space opera, GSB is comming to town. And yet big Shootie battles are less then half the game.  This game is primaraly a ship building simulation. Once you design the layout of your ships provide them orders and set them in formation, time to press the engage button and watch the fireworks.a must have for the stratagy buff who was rased on the clasics of space opera.

												Since I discovered how to mod the game and since they brought Manual Orders to it its really fun.Choose a race, create ships, deploy a fleet, give it orders, then let them go into battle and watch the outcome.Works also well with a touch screen.A really fine game and the parasites DLC is worth it.The game could explain better what each races are good for and where their strongpoints are.Sad to hear that the developer experienced some drama with his community. Its not important that you socialice on the internet, whats important is that you enjoy making good games. This is a good game. Avoid the second game thats sadly broken and unfinished.			"
