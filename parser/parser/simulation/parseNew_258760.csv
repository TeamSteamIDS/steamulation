												Amazing!For those who know and played Euro Truck Simulator 2: This is the same developer, so the ""basics"" in physics and gameplay are  similar (Controls and graphics seem to be much better as far as I can tell).The game itself is different. There is a freeride/delivery-mode as you might know it from ETS2, but it is smaller and, as far as I can see now, less complex (still much fun to play). The ´amazingness´ (Is that a word?) of this game comes from the many modes and missions. Drive along a messed-up road, a mountain pass, or a flooded area (...).  This game seems to be the ""middle"" between ETS2 and 3, to show off what is planned for #3 and what this engine can do. So, in short:+better graphics+better controls+runs much more smooth than ETS2+exciting (!) roads: building sites, narrow bits and tricky obstacles of all kind+brilliant missions+online top-lists encourage competition and motivate to play every mission a thousand times+very well playable with keyboard, pad or wheel+not an easy game at all, but not frustrating->If you screw up a mission, you will go out with 0 points unable to compete with anyone online, but you will never get stuck in a mission, forced to do it a million times in order to be able to go to the next one+++Devs seem to actually read forums and watch videos about their game and listen to the players-the AI has some minor glitches: nothing game-breaking, more funnyConclusion: If you liked ETS2, you will love this game even more. It has everything that people wanted in ETS2.If you have never played ETS and you like to drive trucks in every kind of situation, then this game is something for you.Recommended .... totally!Edit: Game seems to crash when doing Alt+Tab, at least for me. Solution: Window mode (which means fullscreen + task bar) or use OpenGL.Edit²: I found out that this game was released BEFORE ETS2 (Thank you, comments section!). Seems like the fancy graphics have tricked me into some wrong thoughts. ;)			"

												Recommended for fans of Euro Truck Simulator 2 or people interested in realistic truck driving sims.Not a large sandbox world for free roaming like Euro Truck Simulator 2, but in this game the sandbox plays second fiddle to challenges and hazardous courses, and they ARE good. It would be nice to have it all in one game, but if you like ETS2 a lot, you will enjoy Scania Truck Simulator too. I compare it to ETS2 a lot, and for good reason, the games are similar and attract similar gamers except Scania has little mainstream appeal in comparison.Pros- hazardous roads are good areas that are really missing from a game like ETS2.- driving school and competition challenges are well done. Some are very difficult!- graphics are as good if not better than ETS2. Some people miss the fact that Scania is actually an older game- the game world is smaller but it is detailed (makes ETS2 look generic in comparison)- bonus content (actual competition photos and videos are good stuff)- there is still a sandbox mode to free-roam in, though...Cons- smaller and inferior sandbox compared to ETS2 (not bad, but ETS2 is just that good)- driving physics feel inferior to ETS2  [EDIT] - After playing more i find slippery roads and mud to be better than i first thought, so overall physics are quite good.- fewer customisation options (can't set brake sensitivity, disable speed limiter, ""pretty up"" your truck)- game engine lacks some touches (water splash for ex.) Though i played with the relatively crappy Intel HD4000 IGP, so take that into consideration.Overall i'd recommend the game. It won't dissapoint, but it wont blow your mind either. A solid ""niche"" game worth picking up if you're into realistic driving sims.Thumbs up!			"

												If you want a world to drive around in and explore with cargo on the back and visions of long, hard motorway drives cross country borders: Get ETS 2 and avoid this.If you want technical driving, testing your skills at low speed manoeuvers and slowly squeezing yourself through tight gaps having to focus hard: Get THIS and avoid ETS 2.Nothing more to be said, really - graphically, physically and in pretty much all regards, this is very nearly the same game as ETS 2. Only difference is as stated above. This: A technical truck driving simulator. ETS 2: An open truck driving simulator. This doesn't have any managerial aspects (running your own business) but ETS 2 does.One thing I will add though. I think this game would have been better served as a DLC of some kind.			"

												Scania is a great compliment to ETS2.  It provides a sizable amount of Challenge Stages, broken up into a variety of disciplines.  Those familiar with Gran Turismo's Licence Tests will be familiar with these routines.  They're challenging and rewarding, demanding that you learn the finer nuances of skilled truck driving.My personal highlight would be the various obstacle courses, titled Dangerous Drives.  You're given a point to point stretch where you have to navigate tight passages over a great number of environments, high-mountain switchbacks, flooded cityscapes, etc.  25 completely unique environments with fresh assets to test your skills under pressure.Game comes complete with online Leaderboards (watch top replays too) as well as a nice bonus photo/video gallery covering the real-world annual Scania driving test completions.Just remember, this is not ETS2.  It's its own beast with its own set of unique charms.  It's polished as heck just like ETS2 and even shares the same engine.  But that's where the similarities end.  Totally worth it to Driving Simulation fans and a complete no-brainer for those who follow and enjoy SCS Software.Highly recommended.Note: Review based on pre-Steam retail copy.			"

												Quite a nice game for drivers who are seeking for a challenge! It obviously is different than ETS2 (Euro Truck Simulator 2) which many of the reviewers have already mentioned. It has less to offer, only one truck brand and delivering cargo seems to take the minor part in the game. Yet I do recommend it for those people who like precision-driving. This game can really teach you how to properly steer a truck with (or without) a trailer when there is not much space available to manouever. I had lots of fun doing the really challenging  dangerous courses. The game includes some media, mostly photos of Scania trucks, truck-driver competitions and also some short video clips all about trucks and driving them. It maybe is not worth its full price of 15,99€, but if you can manage to grab it for 5€ or below it is totally worth it in my opinion. Recommended!			"

												Scania Truck Driving Simulator (STDS), plain and simple: Do you need help handling your truck? STDS is a game dedicated to helping improve your understanding of truck and trailer handling. If that doesn't interest you, well, I can't make you stay. The rest of the review will be about the gameplay, so buckle up. Or get ready for a nap.Most of you here must've played Euro Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2) to even be remotely interested in this. Don't be ashamed, this game was mostly forgotten when Euro Truck Simulator 2 came out. Why buy this when ETS2 is obviously newer and better? However, it will be on sale until 15th July, 2014, so if you play Euro Truck Simulator 2, you won't regret buying this.First, the gameplay. The gameplay varies from simple driving tutorials to driving on dangerous mountain roads. The game gives you thorough practice on the art of trailer reversing, so if you're struggling with that in Euro Truck Simulator 2 (especially multiplayer mod!) then I will recommend this game for you. But do not think you are playing ETS2. Play the game, how you would any other new game. Expect a new game. Obvious, but true.The handling of the truck (Scania R-series) is different to that in ETS2. The truck feels heavy, underpowered. In fact it might be. But the game isn't about power, or speed. It is about precision and agility, or sometimes even pure luck. Speed is not a big factor in the game. It is perfect if you need to learn about how your trailer behaves on and off the road, whether you try to turn a tight corner or reverse into a loading dock.That was for comparison to ETS2. Now, onto the game itself. I will recommend you go from top to bottom of the menu list, after adjusting the options.Driving Licence gives you basic tutorial lessons on truck driving. If you are new to trucking games, this will be a quick introduction, and it can be challenging. If you are confident with your driving skills (looking at you, ETS2 players), play this section regardless. While ETS2 focuses more on freeroaming and company-building, STDS focuses on handling and precision driving (not necessarily at speeds), and the two games are different based on those values.Driver Competition would be next in line after you finish Driving Licence. You are entered into a competition where you must complete tasks in a showground, while getting around lots of obstacles and without collisions. It will test what you learned previously, and it will also test your patience to the max. Of course, if you're not a perfectionist, things can be a bit less annoying for you.Dangerous Drives feature a range of locations with real-world challenges, from natural disasters to manmade ones. There are a few hours of content in the section, again, depending on whether you want to perfect every challenge or not.Freeform Driving is self explanatory, you can deliver cargo in a freeroaming, exploring manner, although the area is not quite as big as other open-world trucking games in the SCS family. It is not the game's primary focus.Time Reaction Test is also self explanatory, in this section you can test your reaction times. How quickly can you step on the brake pedal when the unexpected occurs?Overall, the game is a content-rich tutorial into the world of trucking. If you are unfamiliar with how trailers behave when you travel in reverse, or to get a feel of the size of trucks (believe me, you'd be surprised at how much space you actually have), or just plain driving for the fun (and thrill of it!), then I recommend this game for you.

												Is this game better than Euro Truck Simulator 2? --- That depends what you are looking for.I got into the truck driving simulator series when I was curious about my skills being able to operate a trailer and take tight turns. I have yet to see a game that puts you in a city situation where you have really check your space margins when taking a right turn next to traffic. Euro Truck simulator seems to focus more on highway driving and has a bit of city driving when you get near the warehouse. Thing is though, seems like warehouses are the only things that make up the cities. I bought Scania for the reason mentioned above about city situations, I wanted to be driving in tight situations where turns would be difficult. The game gives a few options regarding driving such as free drive mode (where you pick up a trailer and deliver it, more like time trial mode), driver license where you go through a tough licensing course, driver competition to test your accuracy around obstacles, and my favorite and reason why I bought this game : dangerous drives. Dangerous drives put you in situations where you must drive your truck or cargo through super tight scenarios (such as driving along side of a cliff). My favorite feature of this game setting is that the devs seemed to try to incorporate everyday life scenarios into this mode. One challenge requires the player to back up their truck behind the stage of a rock show, and attach to a trailer, do a 180 through a bunch of parked cars and other band trailers, and drive away. The controller bindings for this game are absolutely beautiful once you figure it out. I wish more games had this much control over controller settings. Visuals are nice neat and relevant to trucking. No hiccups or gaps here. Sounds are generic as trucks are all the same brand. Although I would put it on par with Euro Truck 2, I would say if Euro Truck had dangerous drives I would have most likely skipped over this game and kept with that one. That being said, I would still like to see a truck driving simulating game that puts the player in a city where they have to make turns in busy pedestrian and traffic scenarios. Sure it would be hard to make entire maps for cities, but even have a few to choose from with a few tight roads to outmaneuver through would be cool. I feel Euro Truck has given in their game a bit more to do, and for that it's rating will be higher than this games. None the less, great purchase on sale.RATING : 7.25/10Gameplay B- Story / Campaign C+ Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability C+ Overall  B-ScreenShots :Expect these sort of type road scenario situations, except every car is stationaryThey place parked cars in convenient placesBeing the rodie at the rock show "

												First of all, if you do own Euro Truck Simulator 2, don't bother this game - it's almost the same game but worse. And if you are going to pay full retail price for this game, buy ETS2 instead.Scania Truck Driving Simulator was made by the developers who made Euro Truck Simulator 2, which is a good thing. The game itself is really great and totally worth the price, but that's because it's almost the same game as ETS2, same map, same vehicles (but only the Scania ones) and same graphics. What I've seen, there's no story mode in this game, unlike ETS2 where you can start like a freelancer make your company growing until you have several employees and trucks. However, that's not how this game was supposed to be either, because then it would have been exactly like ETS2 -but worse.This game though, have some good game modes, including multiplayer and a wide range of tasks. For those who just like driving around, there is a free mode where you can just drive around and do anything you want.At last, as I always do, I recommend this game to the players with a WHEEL, as in my opinion, all driving games are boring with keyboard and mouse. BUT if you do enjoy this kind of games with any kind of controller - don't care about what I think and buy the game.			"

												One major note forward - this game is even less playable by generic ""boredom banisher"" than Euro Truck Sim. Stab and steer, while trying not to catch anything with your long and awkward container... Not the closest description of the fun I can reckon.With that said, the game is alright - in terms of visuals, controls, and, more of all - physics and challenges. If you were ever wandering how's that feels like to drive something as big as that - it's just second best after trying the real wheel. And much more safe all along.What is really good after you'll manage the basics - is about variety of conditions to overcome. And even if you're doing good - there's always a chart with top-scores of points and best time to beat, and it is there the line when you're understanding how casual you are... Neverending challenge to be an average, almost the same as in CS:GO and similar shooters... Only miles harder.So - my mark is 6.5/10, but if I were the trucker, I'd vouch for 8.5/10, I guess.			"

												If you are a fan or Euro Truck Simulator or ETS2 this is a very nice little game to add to your collection. We bought is while on Steam sale for a mere £2.69 just to see what it was like and we were not disappointed. Unlike ETS2, the emphasis is on skillful driving rather than load delivery. So far we have only completed the European Young Driver of the Year competition and the opening Driving Test challnges so I cannot comment on the remaining challenges.Graphics and gameplay is very similar to ETS2. We use a Logitech G29 which is supported by the game. If in doubt please feel free to check out our video series of the game for a better idea of what to expect:

			OK, so it's not really ETS2, but for the purposes of our channel we will consider it ETS2. It is on sale on Steam at the moment so for the sake of £2.69 we decided to give it a go.

												This game is absolutly extrordinary beyond words! It is full of fun and challenges that are actually challenging. It is made by SCS so you know it will definatly be a good game. This simulator puts your skills to the test! Get ready, your in for a fun-packed challenge!The game comes down to 5 different sections:Driver Licence-This is just the beginning of the challenges. You will be put through several tests such as reversing, parking, reverse serpentine, and parking.Driver Competition-This is were you put your skills to the test were your are chellenged with extremly hard challenges such as roundabouts, almost impossible reverses, and more. These driver competetions also take place in real life.Dangerous Drives-You are put through TONS of different situations such as you being stuck in traffic and the only way out is to go on a road with parked cars all over and try to make it through without crashing! Easier said then done!Freeform Driving-This is the part of the game that is similiar to Euro Truck Simulator 2 were you deliver goods to different places. However, the only downsides are that there is no navigation/minimap so when you are trying to make a delivery, there is no way of knowing were to go. You are basically always lost. The map is also not that big, but its a good size.Time Reaction Tests-Lastly, you have the time reaction tests were you are supposed to trive through roads and they give you a ""obsticle"" and you are supposed to stop as soon as possible. Overall, This is a GREAT game and I think that it was nessasary that SCS made this game because it really puts your skills to the test and it determens whether you are a great driver or not. It is also Great fun!Watch me play it!

 FINAL RATING: 9/10The reason I gave it a 9/10 instead of 10/10 is because of the problems with the free driving. If they fix this in a patch, this game gets a 10/10. GO AND GET IT!			"

												I bought this since I liked Euro Truck Simulator 2. While I really enjoy some of the details in Scania I ended up a bit frustrated with it.Pros:+ Definitely more realistic driving simulator than ETS2+ Challenging scenariosCons:- Bugs with steering wheel and pedal setup (Fanatec v2, v3 pedals and H-pattern): I had to copy the setup file from ETS2 and edit it manually to make it work at all- Force feedback has occasional bugs: Ends up working at all or suddenly turns off for a short moment- Engine sound is really low compared to everything else and you can't adjust it- Other cars in traffic sometimes drive through walls or otherwise act insanely- The game is a bunch of driving scenarios without a bigger pictureI recommend this if you really enjoy practicing your parking skills and practicing driving through tight spots.

Brief ReviewA truck driving simulator might not sound like the most exciting of games out there, but Scania is very much a game.  This isn’t just another delivery simulation.  The crux of Scania Truck Driving Simulator is maneuvering your big rig through a number of dangerous situations and hazardous courses filled with real-life obstacles.  You’ll be put into critical situations where flooding or the aftermath of an earthquake, play a part in compromising what would normally be a direct and hazard free delivery routePros and ConsProsGreat FunAddictive GameplayGreat GraphicsKid FriendlyLeadboardsCompetitiveConsCant Think Of AnyAn EndingProve your truck skills - Put your driving skills to the ultimate test			"

												This yet another great game by SCS, however i do not play it that much i will do the odd challenge here and there when i am not playing Euro Truck Simulator 2, this game is perfect for those who find ETS2 too slow and boring with the long journeys as the longest challenge i have done in this game was no more than 3-4 minutes long. Also great for people who are competitive as the game features online leaderboards if you have the money to spare i would definatly reccomend grabbing the Deluxe bundle edition as you will get 5 games and plenty of the DLC for ETS2 for only $50 which is alot cheaper than buying the 5 games individually and they are all just as good as each other even if some are older or you only end up playing ETS2 (which alot of people do) it is definatly worth the money (and the money saved) to get this game in the bundle.

												I really want to like this game. It does have some bright spots in it. The driving to point A without hitting anything to point B is fun and short. So thats good. The steering is a little on the wonky side. Their is no auto center so the steering wheel goes from right to left all the time unlike a real car that would try to go back to center.Graphics are good and sharp looking. So events are fun. The load hauling part of the game is the so-so part. It has no auto park load so you must manually park every load you are carrying. Thats annoying. I am glad they killed that in Euro Trucker 2. However the price is only $17 dollars so its priced right.  Enjoyable for short bursts. Not as addicting as ETS2.			"

The Dangerous drives move is really good too and after completing it you won't find a parking space difficult ever again.			"

Product received for free
												Despite quite a bit of playing time with ETS2 (which this product was included with), I still find the technical aspects of the challenges in STDS entertaining.The actual transport operations are better in ETS2, but the scenarios and driving skill tests in this program are more compelling.Forget the external views, and complete the exercises from the cab using mirrors alone. Nice.			"

												This game has a plethora of stability issues and bugs.   Under Win10 64bit, 4K resolution, the game crashes on launch unless you run in safe mode - trying to set the resolution up just causes the game to crash, so you're kind of stuck there.If you do get it to run, you end up with an experience similar to ETS2, but not as good. Just go with ETS2.   Sorry Scania fans.			"

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 was like a trucker business sim, with long stretches of road and jobs to take on and get paid so you can buy/upgrade trucks or start your own business.  Picking up trailers or delivering them was always really easy, so it wasn't challenging enough to be interesting and the long stretches of road were populated enough with details to be somewhat convincing, but it gets old after a while.  The real star of Euro Truck Simulator 2 was the fantastic traffic AI and dealing with traffic respectfully throughout your travels.  A great game for what it is.Scania Truck Driving Simulator is made by the same company, but this time it focuses on everything about truck driving that is technical.  There are truck driving license tests, there are championship truck driving competition challenges (exact copies of real life events) which require extreme precision and there are short refined stretches of dangerous drives to attempt more like natural obstacle tracks.I ate a lot of penalties for minor collisions, but some of the challenges were tricky just to finish at all due to very particular trailer angling requirements around certain bends.  You're forced to understand what each mirror is for and gain an appreciation for them, putting them to regular use.  Through-out the game, you come to understand some of the strategies necessary to accomodate for the semitrailer.While it has all those challenge modes, it also has a couple freeroam modes similar to a large city in ETS2 that have trailer missions to pick up and medals to collect if you can find them.  Certainly the most casual of the modes, it does not have ETS2's lengthy 30 minute drive requirements and instead focuses more on quick pickup and deliveries with technical driving aspects.If trucks don't interest you this probably won't change that, but if you care a little bit then you are likely to come out of it feeling elucidated in respect to trucking.

Reversing is a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ The trucks got a big♥♥♥♥♥ And the logic in some missions is pure swedish level. They could just detach the trailer before making any U turn.

												Great game! If you have ETS2 you will love this game regardless of what truck brand you drive. This game will seriously test your driving abilaties and will separate the men, from the boys! I find that you require a little more patients for this game than ETS2. One tip for the ""Dangerous Drives"" missions is to make small adjustments to your steering wheel and take your time, don't drive too fast or you will trash the entire mission. Also, try not to use your exterior camera view, you won't get as many points if you don't. If I was to rate it, I would rate it 4/5 stars. I got this game on sale for 80% off and I recomend doing the same. Long story short, this game is pretty good! Good job SCS!			"

												I suppose this is a decent simulator and I drove a few hours but the game has no gameplay value whatsoever. Once training is over you can drive difficult manouvering roads to test your skills, and the end game is just to drive around picking up and delivering cargo in an anonymous city and surroundings. No real in game rewards, no upgrades, no story line. It gets quckly boring and i found myself trying to go offroad for a bit of fun. No can do, the ""invisible wall"" will bounce you right back.Perhpas this is more of a training program for those aspiring to become real life truck driver, i don't know.Ditched!			"

												Scania Truck Driving Simulator is similar to Euro Truck Simulator 2, (ETS2) why? STDS acts the same to ETS2, but a lot more challenging. Instead of driving to, Point A to Point B on the highway to hell, you get something called ""Dangerous Drives"", In the these type of challenges you will have to manoeuvre you're truck in tight spaces, keep an eye on you're mirrors at all times and you're trailer.If your new to the game, don't worry STDS comes with a basic's to trucking. It will teach you how to park a trailer in various scenarios, which will come in handy. (Duh)Overall if you're bored of ETS2 and want more of a challenge, then Scania Truck Driving Simulator is for you!11/10 - Would drive of a cliff again!			"

												STDS is far more punishing to novice drivers. If you think backing a trailer is hard in ETS2, just wait until you experience the rage-fuelled exercise in misery that attempting the same in STDS turns out to be. Your gear-shifting has to be more accurate, your stopping distances longer, and if you're anything like me, you'll stall the truck roughly 285 times during hill-starts or when manoeuvring at low speed. (Planting your foot on the accelerator for a couple of seconds before releasing the clutch rapidly becomes a way of life.) And if you think you can just hook up a trailer and trundle off in 4th gear like you do in ETS2... I'm afraid not. The Scania you have in STDS is powered by an emaciated hamster with a respiratory infection, and he just can't turn that driveshaft fast enough.Compared to this, ETS2 is child's play. You spend the vast majority of your time cruising down the Autobahn listening to Def Leppard. In STDS, you're navigating tiny cargo yards strewn with pallets and forkhoists, or squeezing down narrow side streets between parked cars and roadworks. And then, if you actually manage to get to your destination without ploughing into a field or getting yourself stuck in a hedge, you'll spend the next 20 minutes performing a 27 point turn in a cack-handed attempt to slot the trailer into the crevice left between another trailer and those barrels some git left sitting in the middle of the yard.Most of the truck drivers I know swear a lot. If there was such a thing as the 'profanity olympics', they'd be gold medallists. Now that I've played STDS, I know why. Having said that, it's a lot of fun. You do, after a few hours spent shrieking like a lunatic and cursing the laws of physics, get the hang of it. I can now make deliveries without causing a multiple car pile up in the middle of an intersection. I can navigate the city (no GPS for you, young man) pretty well, and I can even reverse my trailer into position without stalling, punching a hole through a fence or reducing a pedestrian to an unsightly crimson smear on the pavement. I still can't parallel park. But then I can barely parallel park my car, so I'm not that fussed to be honest.To sum up, STDS is basically ETS2 with mushy controls, crappy force feedback, slightly dodgy physics, somewhat underwhelming audio (the Scania doesn't so much roar as mewl piteously), no career mode, a much smaller map, and a learning curve so steep you'll need a velcro wetsuit dipped in PVA glue to have even a hope of scaling it. Unlike ETS2, it forces you to drive properly -- pay attention to your mirrors, shift gears at the right time, make tiny adjustments to the steering wheel when manoeuvring, and practice, practice, practice. Because it really is a simulator (as well as being a gloriously shameless advertising campaign for Scania), as opposed to a scenic tour of Europe by truck. I love both games, and for completely different reasons, but I would recommend STDS to die-hard truck driving fans, Scania fetishists and masochists only. This is a game that will kick you in the crotch and then laugh about it, but if you're willing to spend the time (and we're talking a lot of time here) mastering it, it may eventually shake your hand and buy you a pint.Maybe.

												First of all, if you do own Euro Truck Simulator 2, don't bother this game - it's almost the same game but worse. And if you are going to pay full retail price for this game, buy ETS2 instead.Scania Truck Driving Simulator was made by the developers who made Euro Truck Simulator 2, which is a good thing. The game itself is really great and totally worth the price, but that's because it's almost the same game as ETS2, same map, same vehicles (but only the Scania ones) and same graphics. What I've seen, there's no story mode in this game, unlike ETS2 where you can start like a freelancer make your company growing until you have several employees and trucks. However, that's not how this game was supposed to be either, because then it would have been exactly like ETS2 -but worse.This game though, have some good game modes, including multiplayer and a wide range of tasks. For those who just like driving around, there is a free mode where you can just drive around and do anything you want.At last, as I always do, I recommend this game to the players with a WHEEL, as in my opinion, all driving games are boring with keyboard and mouse. BUT if you do enjoy this kind of games with any kind of controller - don't care about what I think and buy the game.			"

												This is the most challenging and exciting truck driving game ever! The only drawback is absence of actual instructions on how to maneuver your semi trailer properly. There are licence courses, but no lessons. I had to figure things out by trial and error, and in some cases searched internet for information on proper technique. Doing everything using just mirrors and visual observation from driver's seat is not easy, but external cameras make tasks too simple. I am sure experience from the challenges in this game will be invaluable for upcoming American Truck Simulator. Despite lack of actual teaching, this is by far the best truck driving trainer. Highly recommended to anybody interested in trucking and especially precision manuevering.			"

												there is not much to this game, just challenges and online play. No story line or anything. The tasks are fun, hard and take a lot of skill but it is short lived, when you have completed a few challenges it does seem to get repetitive and lame. Compared to the euro truck sims and that this game is a bit of a let down as it lacks story and character.			"

												Could'nt get throttle and brake to register on controller.  It would bind find as would everything else, but throttle is unresposive no matter what i did.  Even stranger though, the default WASD settup throttle would not register the key being held.  Mash it Mario Party Style and work your way up a few thousand RPM's.  lol.

												muchmuchmuch better than ETS2. THIS is the real simulator my friend, this is where you can learn. In ETS2 you just going straight, and there are no real cities and real situations where the space is very limited, and objects block your way. In real life very often you have to manouver between small spaces like houses, cars, objects, and even to park in to your company.Real truckers will know what im sayin...if you want to be a trucker leave ETS2 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, that gives you nothing but boring driving (in real life the same driving is exciting as well, but that is just a game).

												If your even vaugely interested in this, try the demo for Euro Truck Simulator 2. Pay attention to how much you like parking the trailer at the end of a delivery, because whether that is a challenge you relish or the least enjoyable thing imaginable will let you know if you interested for the challenges this game serves up. The graphics engine seems to be the same, so the ETS2 demo should give you a handle on how well Scania will run on your machine.If you must know, I usually skip parking the trailer, so I'm glad I got this game in a bundle.

												This is the first game from the company SCS Software that i purchased, and i admit it was pretty much based upon the dangerous drives after playing the demo version over and over, i just had to get more...But if your a Truck Driver Wannbe, then you should consider buying this title and pitting your wits against some of the other online drivers in the various competitions, events, and drives that it offers. But if your after a true truck drivers lifestyle type affair then something like Euro Truck Sim2 would be the better choice.This is more a cross between a scania tribute and the trucking events held annually...Of course with any company each new release gets that tad more refined and starts to show in the options and menus and so forth, and if you have played the newer titles, then you will understand when it comes to playing this one. But i recommend it just for the dangerous drives with the added events if your good enough. "

												In some ways this game has been effectively replaces, though I think it still it has a good place if you want a realistic truck driing simulator. That place is in the challenges. The challenges here will push your ability to drive the truck to the limit, a limit which seems nearly impossible to reach even if you have played Euro Truck Simulator for a while, because Euro Truck is not nearly as challenging as this. You need to know how to drive the truck masterfully here, and if learning to masterfully drive a truck appeals to you, this is a game worth getting,			"

Why buy this game?Buy this game if you want to: Learn to park properly in Euro Truck Simulator 2Learn to park well in American Truck Simulator.Become more proficient at parking a real tractor trailerI've had Euro Truck for a couple of years now. I bought American Truck when it came out in February. This went on sale in June, so I picked it up, just for fun. Then, I went to school in August to get my CDL (in the USA). There's 3 parts to CDL training, the classroom, the range, and the road. The classroom is boring but necessary; it's the rules and regulations you NEED to know to get your CDL. The road, well that's self-explanatory. The range, that's the intermediate step, and, for many, it's where they fail their skills test.The range is where they test your knowledge of pre-trip inspection, it's also where they test your ability to manuever in tight spaces; parking.The straight back, the offset back sight side (left), the offset back blind side (right), the parallel park (sight side & blind side), and the Alley dock (90 degree sight side). I could do them all fairly well with very little practice; both my grandfather and my father were truck drivers, I'd better be able to. But about every 3rd time I did the alley dock, I'd miss and screw it up. So, I spent about four hours practicing each of the above in Scania Truck Driving Simulator one Sunday. The next morning I went to the range, and nailed the Alley dock four times in a row. Even with the added length of a long-nose Freightliner and a 53' trailer compared to whatever cute little setup the Europeans use, I had no trouble translating the practicing done with this simulator into real world skills.Even if you're not getting your CDL, buy this game, it will help you to appreciate the skill of the average truck driver.

												Amazing little game to improve your truck driving skills, have fun and try to top others on the leaderboardsPros:- Improves your truck driving skills which can better your ablities in Euro Truck Simulator 2 and other games- Very fun to play- Very pleasing when you ask your peers to try and complete a challenge and they fail miserably - Very challenging and tense- Unique driving experience trucks perform different to trucks in Euro Truck Simulator 2 and other gamesCons:- Theres not alot to the game, once you have completed all challenges theres nothing else to do- Freeform driving where you pick up loads and drop them off has very short distances and becomes boring- Some people may disagree but i believe the price should be around £3 to £5 not £8- Took me about 2-3 hours to complete all challenges (including retries)Overall i would recommend this game under these curcumstances:- You have the cash to splash, if your on low money and dont know what game to buy dont buy this- If you like a short game and are willing to re-visit it every once in a while - If you love truck games - If your competitive and really want to make the leaderboards no matter how long it takes			"

												Scania Truck Driving Simulator isn’t the first driving simulator I’ve played, but I’d say it’s probably one of the best.  This isn’t about car or truck racing, though there are timed events and scoreboards that are based on how well and how fast you complete the objectives.  This is more for people who are into realism in their driving simulators, but you shouldn’t let that stop you from giving it a try.  This is a title that can be enjoyed and even appreciated by a family since it involves trucks, something that many young kids like, and considering it’s a simulator, it’s also very easy to get into.  I’m sure that if you enjoy driving simulators like this or have always wanted to try a simulator like this, that you’ll end up enjoy Scania Truck Driving Simulator once you give it a try.			"
