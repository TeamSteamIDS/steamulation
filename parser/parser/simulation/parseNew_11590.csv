												Dont waste your money.   The game gets really boring after a few hours.  I beat the game and decided to give sandbox mode a try.  You never get more then 8-10 patients at a time.  The Doctors outnumber the Patients 2:1.   Theme hospital is much much better			"

												I give this a 2 out of 5 stars.Pros: Nice graphics styleHumorousCustomizable room and equipment colors (helpful for identifying room-types at a glance!...and for pretties ;)Nice variety of waiting room/decor items that actually increase patient moodsInteresting & funny diseasesLots of specialized equipmentSocial aspect for staff affects work performanceCons:""Story"" is extremely boring.  The writer thought they were much funnier than they actually were. No way to skip the agonizing story segments either.Many functions are not intuitive and their use is not explained.  Especially hard to pick up after not playing for quite some time because of this.Staff do not work effiently with no way to micromanage them to do a better job. i.e.: I had 2 Decontamination rooms because there was an infectious desease plaguing my hospital.  I hired 4 Decontaminators to handle the load.  They all tried to bring patients to the same Decontamination room which kept it backed up.I would have liked more variety of decor and room customization.Talking nurse head that gives out missions has that annoying Animal Crossing gibberish and can't be turned off.Does NOT scratch that ""Theme Hospital"" itch!!  I still find myself going back to play that after I get frustrated with this game.I admittedly haven't played this a ton, but that's because it is so infuriating and pales in compairison with Theme Hospital.  I REALLY want an update of that game, but I thought I'd give this a go.  At first I thought it was almost exactly like Theme Hospital...but newer, but it quickly falls apart.  The story plays out like a hospital drama/comedy and the idea is solid, but it drags out and makes me want to poke the writer in the eye.  It's like watching your kid brother try to crack wise, but really it's just sad.  Very disappointing.The diseases and equipment/trteatments are very much inspired by TH, and that's a good thing.  But my patience runs thin when staff aren't effeciently getting paients to their rooms.  It's even harder to deal with when I have to piddle around with ALL the buttons to figure out what I need to do to get things done.  It's hard to tell exactly what you need to do or fix to complete missions/levels.  Most of the time I passed without knowing what I'd fixed. "

NO it is not enough like Theme Hospital to satisfy hardcore Bullfrog fans but it is enough like it to enjoy! the Simish voices truly♥♥♥♥♥♥me off and it was a huge mistake to have them in the game but the game is playable and is easily enjoyable. First person mode is a great idea and some of the humour isn't bad. The game is cheap and everyone loves Theme Hospital, give it a chance.			"

												This isn’t a broken game, or a terrible game, but it's a game that never was great and is even worse now that it is aging.  ProsHospital Tycoon isn’t a terrible idea and I think this game at least provides a proof of conceptConsThe campaign is pretty terrible, but you’ll have to play it to know what to do in sandbox mode.It's so unrealistic.  Treatment doesn’t occur in the examination room but the pharmacy.  That’s not just unrealistic it's counterintuitiveThe gameplay basically consists of a new illness being identified and then the game telling you what new equipment to buy.  The depth is really lacking.  You don’t build out the hospital or decide how much people get paid. All you do is place rooms in a big sandbox and then buy equipment and put it inside.The game is way too silly in my opinionThe game has a 1080p mode, but everything is just stretched out to make it fit the screen.The aerial view just shows you the rooms, not any of the people or equipment.You can’t zoom out far enough.

												Please note that I got this game very cheaply as part of a bundle.The game it set in 3 different hospitals (a series - though the graphics and mechanics are identical in each) with 4 'episodes' in each - in other words, 12 missions. They have tried to implement a story as a way of introducing each mission but this is actually one of the biggest let downs of the game. I'm a story fan but this is truly awful; the attempt at humor is terrible!That's not to say the game isn't funny - the diseases, the animations etc are all funny and well done but I think they should have just left it at that and removed the story element altogether.There's a lot wrong with the game. In each mission you have a scenario that you start with and a set of objectives to complete and you can spend your time re-arranging the hospital, improving the decor, training up the staff and getting things running well only to have it all reset at the start of the next mission. This is particularly jarring within a series where each episode is supposed to just be the next shift at the hospital. Still, once you get used to it you won't keep making that mistake again.There's also some annoyances such as not being able to properly rotate the screen when you get to the edge of the hospital which makes it difficult to place items in those corners. Also the information screens are sorely lacking - it would be nice to see the laziness rating of the staff on the staff summary screen rather than having to click on every individual staff member one by one. And where's the financial info? Absolutely no financial data on profits / expenses etc which is odd.But despite all of those negatives I'm actually going to give this game a thumbs up because in the end, I enjoyed playing it and it gave me about 12 hours of entertainment which is all that matters. However, I wouldn't pay full price for it. I would say that if you are looking specifically for a hospital game and can pick it up cheaply then do so but if you're looking for a sim / tycoon / management game in general and don't mind the genre then give it a miss as there are much better ones out there.

												Imagine you have Theme Hospital; a very fun, very goofy hospital sim, in all of its glory. Now, remove the clever sense of humor, the fun art style, pretty much any sense of creativity, and then throw in a soap opera mechanic that makes what little the game had going for it feel even worse. Now you have Hospital Tycoon.For those of you that want to play a fun hospital sim, look up Theme Hospital, it's available on multiple platforms including PC. For those of you that have already played Theme Hospital, well, there's no place like home.			"

Then I realised that due to the small number of patients attending your hospital at one time it and profit being easy to make. However you can rotate items unlike how other reviews have said.. So that's one positive.			"

												It's not Theme Hospital but it tries hard to be and succeeds mostly.  So far I am on Season 3 Episode 3 and am enjoying it in story mode.  It's not nearly as hard as Theme Hospital is.  However the only thing I can 100% guarantee you will want to do is turn off the sound.  When they talk it's the Sims gibberish and it just repeats over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over...The graphics are not quite up there with Theme Hospital either but that is because Theme Hospital was Sprites while this went with a very early 3d model engine.  So the 3d models are not nearly as detailed or look as good as the sprites do.Overall I am quite enjoying my time with it.  Is it the classic that Theme Hospital is? Nope.  But it's a fun little romp through a soap opera Theme Hospital wannabe.			"

It is painfully obvious that the goal was to create another Theme Hospital. Rather than improving or even meeting the standards of Theme Hospital, this is simply a fail IMO. A nice try, but a fail none the less. Give a go if you want, if you really loved Theme Hospital. It isn't too painfully expensive, and if you can catch it on sale it is worth a try to spend a couple of bucks on it in an attempt to relive the days of Theme Hospital if you think you may be so inclined.

I think the gameplay is fun and it is entertaining to watch your staff members and patients run around the hospital doing things by themself.

												This is probably one of the worst games I've ever played and is really showing it's age (released in 2007), but that's not the reason why I dislike it. I dislike this game, because the hospital in this game doesn't even look like a hospital. It's like a mix between a very small airport, a medical practice and a train station which has severe funding issues (but I guess funding issues come down to if you actually play this game or not).The storyline is extremely short and is poorly written, and has nothing to do with running a hospital. There are more doctors and nurses in the 'hospital' than there are actual patients. I don't really mind the poor graphics due to how old this game is but some of the mechanics are horrible. The AI's who work at the 'hospital' don't do their jobs (as designed). Quite a few of the patients which had been admitted, died while either using the restroom or died on the way to get treated - and you can't do anything about that. I understand that the AI are poorly written and this game was released in 2007, but there have been other games that were released in 2007 which were no where near this level of awfulness. This game isn't unplayable but you probably won't enjoy it.Even though I received this game in a Humble Bundle, simply put, please don't buy this. It's not worth the money and effort to install even if you got it for a relatively good price. If you do end up purchasing this game, you'll probably end up requesting a refund from Steam.			"

												If you want to run a Hospital get Theme Hospital instead. This game is very similar with less controls. With TH you get to increase pay wages and control heating and money spent on researching cures and some random challenges within the game mode. This game has ZERO controls involved. All you get to do is build rooms, hire/fire staff and decorate the hospital and nothing else. I would prefer a hospital game where I can control staff hours, wages, the types of tasks they can perform, break times, charges for each treatment per doctor. I would also make it more realistic and include plastic surgery and post surgery recovery time spent in the hospital bed. Throw in a cafe, job posting where I can list tasks, work schedule and skill requirements just to add more to the game. If this game is offered to you for FREE then take it but don't waste the money on this game. You won't play it very much.			"

												I've heard good things about this game and really love management sims, so I played the Story mode to learn how to play the game and I have to say the mechanics are certainly one of the best features of this game. The writing of the story itself is pretty poor, but this game doesn't take itself seriously. The story is done by a scrolling text on the bottom of the screen which sometimes changes too quickly to read, and there is no voice acting in terms you'd expect. Instead they use a technique similar to Simlish so the game can be played in multiple languages. However, story mode is but a tutorial and the game seems well rounded in terms of mechanics and animation.There are several aspects to the game mechanics and running a successful hospital hinges on being able to provide enough staff and equipment to deal with the influx of patients without going into the red, as well as keeping everyone happy. Happiness is determined by how much decoration is placed and there were times where it felt more like ""Interior Design Tycoon"". It's fairly easy as management sims go, but still enjoyable.I especially enjoyed discovering new diseases and putting new systems in place to treat them. The diseases are shown on collectible cards which show info on examination and treatment procedures. They are collected by researching someone with an unknown disease.Overall this game is great if you're looking for a management sim.			"

												Hospital Tycoon is not as good as the 10 year older Theme Hospital.The story mode has an awfully written story. It is supposed to be made like a drama, but the whole story arc is shallow and just bad. The graphics are the strongest point of this game, despite weird animations.There are some crucial programming errors like pathing problems (Receptionists not doing their job and patients dying in the rest room) and script errors in the story, where it is impossible to finish a level after missing an instruction.There are no graphs at all, just some basic stats listed for your staff. This game should not even be named a Tycoon game.			"

												It seems like very little time went into the designing of this game. The career scenarios are very short and pretty much walk you through what to do step by step. I much prefer some of the other tycoon games such as zoo and roller coaster where the goals are more broad and force you to make decisions. After finishing the career (which is basically 3 levels) I gave sandbox a shot. It seemed more promising as the start seemed more challenging if you set the difficulty to hard, unfortunately, it is riddled with glitches making it unplayable. I couldnt get through the initial minutes without a glitch that completely stopped the progress, for example, all the engineers will freeze midrepair of equipment or the research doctors will simply act as if there is no patients requiring research, making it impossible to treat patients. The gameplay is somewhat amusing but the glitches ruin it. I also could not figure out how to rotate the screen view for the life of me. There are keyboard controls but there is no help menu to tell you what buttons are which and i could only find a few.			"

I hope this review won't sound too harsh.I went in wanting to like this game, I really did.This the worst tycoon game I have ever played, and quite possible the worst game in general that I have ever played.Interface is very bad. The sims like noises the characters make when their dialog box pops up is atrocious. The game will freeze up every now and then for no reason. The minimal AI that is normally required in this type of game is horrible. I also don't think the developers had ever stepped foot in a hospital before they made this game. The very core of the game is bad. Do not go into this game expecting it to be in any way similar to the great indie ""tycoon"" games that are on the market (such as Prison Architect, Game Dev Tycoon, etc.) because you will be sorely disappointed.It's just... so bad. So terribly bad. If you got this game from the Humble Bundle, do yourself a favor and don't download it. Use the 260 MB storage that you'll save for something better, like pictures of Al Gore or something. Anything is better. I felt gross and sticky after playing just 5 minutes of the game.   All in all, I give it a 7/10 "

												Found this game somewhat entertaining at first, but it lacks in replay value and the story mode is too short, I was surprised how fast I finished this game as I was expecting more. Sandbox mode doesn't captivate for long either as there's just not an aweful lot you can do.Might be something to play once in a blue moon if you want to kill some time.Don't think I would really recommend this game, least it's pretty cheap but there's better games out there for same or less money.

Posted: September 23, 2014
												It's as if Theme Hospital and [a paired-down version of] The Sims had a bit of a romance and then this popped out!Therefore, a lovely little bit of reminiscence [with a twist!] for those of us craving a Theme Hospital fix, with a lil extra cherry on top! I don't know if it's just nostalgia, but I think I do still consider Theme Hospital the better [more polished] of the two [still available on GOG.com I think?]...... but this is a refreshing [yet still pretty retro!] lil take on that previous classic, with some added soap opera drama thrown in!PROS: Great for re-living the classic but with a 'fresh' new angle and visuals [You even get fresh new silly/fun-style diseases and illnesses to treat in the style of TH!] Campaign mode has a pretty daft/humorous [yet strangely entertaining!] soap opera style storyline to keep the ball rolling through the levels/challenges Nice to have the chance to experience the Theme Hospital genre through a more '3D' world this time!  Still retains the feel of a very highly customisable building experience [I know *I* have a bit of an obsession with layouts and colour schemes for laying out and organising these sorts of places, so any others of you who do too will be glad to know there's plenty of capability, considering this is still a fairly retro-ish game] Whilst I didn't go all out on exploring this aspect, I thought it was pretty cool that you can actually control/micromanage the staff and affect their inter-staff relations and actions, live!CONS: The camera angles at times are just INFURIATING! [e.g. when you need to pan down to the bottom of the aerial view 'map' of the hospital to be able to see where you can fit a new room, there are serious issues with being able to see to the edges. NB: This *can* sometimes be 'remedied' by rotating the camera around a few times - but that is only SOMETIMES!] Basically, if you are the kinda person to flip-tables and rage-quit over this sorta stuff, maybe it's best steering clear - for your own sanity ;P [personally, I soldiered on patiently...but it was still fairly painful at times :P] Depends on your humour: if you can't stand lame [meant to be self-affacing I think] jokes or cheesy parodying then maybe this isn't for you either! [I just kinda went with it, rolling my eyes to myself...by the end I actually produced a chuckle now and then...what has happened to me?!? hahlp.] And of course, the graphics are very dated and the character models/animation a bit awkward...but hey, that's to be expected right? Some could criticise it for being ""just a Theme Hospital clone"", and to be honest, it kinda is. [But what's wrong with that, when it's also ADDING to the previous style with some of the fun new bits and bobs mentioned above?]Overall, I picked this up for something like 89p if I remember correctly... And I *certainly* got well over 89p's-worth of value out of it! It was possible to sink a good few hours into this game and thoroughly enjoy the experience.Pick yourself up a copy next time it's on sale, and surprise yourself with how much you can actually still enjoy a game that's pretty rough around the edges in places, a bit silly, but just downright fun :)!

												What a disappointement. There were no patients. My hospital had 5 stars but only 16 patients at a time. I don't know how the care system is wherever this game was conceived but here in Portugal it's more like 16 patients getting into the hospital per minute!! 10/10 would uninstall it. It got boring very quickly!			"

Burnt out people need to be treated fast (try putting more than one table in the physio department?).			"

												As a fan of Tycoon games, I happened to enjoy this hospital simulator.The graphics are cute and the gameplay is rather simple.  There is almost no ""micromanagement"", which I liked, and there's not much problem solving to be had.  The social aspects between staff members are negligible.  You can beat all the scenarios fairly easily, and there is a sandbox to play in, too.  The storylines weren't great, but they existed.  There were some bugs/glitches, but nothing game breaking.  Overall, I thought it was fun to play and a refreshing spin on an old classic.  Hospital Tycoon is to Theme Hospital as Sim Theme Park (Theme Park World) is to Theme Park.Playable while intoxicated-- very important to some people.  Keep it simple and rewarding.			"

												Can you distinguish between a piece of poo and a dog? Neither can I, but this game teaches you the value of not knowing how to do that. Why is this important? Well to begin my subpoena, I would like to first mention that Abraham Lincoln was not only one of the greatest presidents, but he was also the king of the rap game back in the 13th century. Sounds strange, but the Virginia Internation Institution of Cosmetics and Applications of makeup in modern society discovered that Abraham Lincoln  did order that the declaration of independence be written in a style reminiscent of the new hip hop song ""White men cannot eat nor poop before taking a gun into the street"". George Washington, however in the last minute, changed it to sound more like the old Beatles song ""Slavery is not fun, but we will tolerate it"". Pretty bad for George Washington, and that is the sole reason why you should not only purchase this game for it educational prowess, but also revel in its glory by sacrifing your closest friend in honor and reincarnation of Abraham Lincoln into a small, albino Goat.

												A funny game that is a great remake of the orignal game.It is funny and entertaining.Don't expect a super-serious sim, this is for entertainment. It is hilarious sometimes even.I loved the original Hospital tycoon, and this version is a great update both graphically and depth.It is still a small game and should cost you more than 5$... I got it on sale at 1.25$ I think.If you want to laugh while playing a little business sim, go ahead and buy this one, unlike some other bigger budget games, it is quite stable and bug-free.			"

												I thought that perhaps for only 87p I'd give this game a try but I was wrong. I first loaded up the game and attempted to get it into a windowed version, which the game doesn't currently have. After changing the resolution twice to 2 different resolutions, the game crashed and I am now unable to even start the game. I have uninstalled and reinstalled it and I am still waiting for the bug to somehow magically fix itself. Save the 87p to buy 3 Freddo's or Overlord on Steam. Stupid game bugs.			"

												Overview: Hospital Tycoon is a game in which you run a hospital that you recently overtook. There isnt really much to say, the entire gameplay is in the game. Pros: I've got nothing.Cons:Feels like a rip off of an old game called Theme Hospital. Same idea of building hospital rooms and making your hospital better, however it seems less well implimented. When you complete an ""episode"" (which follows tired hospital drama tropes), all your progress is reset and new stuff is put in place instead. Following the last con, the game doesnt give you a sense of doing anything. Anything you accomplished in the last episode like building a new opperation room over the windows because why not is gone in the next episode.The whole episode thing in general. The episodes are too short for me to like them as a feature. If the episodes were longer than like.... 10 minutes, it'd be good. For a game that tries hard to be a ~*cool hospital drama*~ it even fails at that mark, making it a bland game to play. I'm surpised I managed to put as long as I did into it. If my purchase of this game hadnt of gone to charity I'd want a refund.			"

What I got was a game similar to Theme hospital in that I can hire and fire staff and they treat the sickly that come into your hospital and thats where the similarities end.It wasn't a bad game for the price but I am not recommending it at any other price.Short and restrictiveIt's set as some sort of mock on a hospital drama sitcom thing, it trys to be funny but it really isnt.the story line is boring and ends up being skipped  to get to the actual game play but that also isn't overly fun, but it kills time. You can pick from a small selection of preset sized rooms to use for your treatments you cant change sizes.You can't make your hospital bigger.Don't get used to the layout you may have created while in story mode, each ""episode"" erases what you have done anyway.Its ok at 69pence but a rip off for anything higher.

At first I liked the story part of the game and thought it added a nice element to a sandbox game, but then in the next chapter all the things I had modified/built in the first chapter were gone. Gone. Maybe I've been playing sandbox and management games wrong this entire time, but this is a first for me. I quit storied mode immediately and went on to play in full sandbox mode. It was a lot more fun but eventually it just turned into sitting there waiting for a new disease to spring up to give you 30 seconds of something to do as you built a new hospital ward. Then it seemed to run out of new diseases and I spent the rest of my time tabbed out checking facebook. Will probably never play this again. Boring.			"

Yeah it's a nostalgia cash grab for Theme Hospital, and it's evident within the first 10 minutes that it falls flat on its♥♥♥♥♥♥So many game mechanics that logically would require 1 click, actualy require 3 or more, which makes playing it tedious, and slows down the overall pace of the game.Then there's silly(er) things like the HUD blocking where you want to click.Controls are awkward.AI is non existant. Patients will hang around waiting for doctors/nurses or equipment to be free so they can get tested. Even though everyone/thing is idle.On the plus side, there aren't any stability bugs. No crashes. That's how low the bar Codemasters set before they released this game. "

												I tried to enjoy this game as I enjoyed Theme Hospital so much, 100's of hours on that but this... I couldn't enjoy any part!The building is horrible, gameplay is horrible and animations are... horrible!I hate to say this on a building type of game but ""Thumbs Down""...Most of the 10-20 minutes playing this I placed trash cans, coffee machines and watched people with headaches' that looked like their brains were in a 850w microwave! UGHHH AVOID PLEASE!..			"

												This game is....odd. I wouldnt say bad odd, just odd. The diseases and what you need for them could be toned down. Half the time I cant see due to a explosive sneezer, or the fact that the research machine is covering the office I need to reach because I need to get to one of the doctors. I also found out the janitorA.I are stupid. They clean everything and I mean EVERYTHING. If you start your own hospital and build a big onw and you just have a lot of space in the beginning, you wont ever see your janitors again. They are too busy cleaning the back of the mall that noone is touching. I give it a 6/10. I recommend it for people who have time, patience, and more smarts then me. I dont fully understand the need for social interactions in this game however, except for playing along to the Sims as its own little hospital setting to seek romance and enemies.			"

												I'm personally enjoying this game very much. I remember playing Theme Hospital on my PS1 and I couldn't stop playing it - rather addictive in my experience. The gameplay remains the same as its predecessor, but now there's more social interactions between sims... and DRAMA! It's not as modern as you'd expect it to be (graphics, controls, etc.), so if you aren't a 90's kid, I don't recommend it for you.For a  90's kid (and below), the graphics and loading won't disturb you as much. I love the scenarios they've added in-game, which only brings out the inner child in me. Way to go back to the past!7.5/10			"

												Such a HUGE disapointment!! I had Theme Hospital by Bullfrog now that game was awesome! This game is okay but it doesnt give you any instructions I had to work out how to do things myself, it seriously needs an update if it was updated I wouldnt think it was so bad but honestly what a waste of money developing this game. I wish Bullfrog would make a theme hospital 2 how awesome would that be! I'd pay $100+ for that! but for Tycoon im glad it was no more then $5, tottaly not worth your money.			"

												It's an older game, so I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt, but it didn't grab my attention.  The character models are pretty ugly, and the muzak is mind numbing.  Everyone speaks an off brand version of the Sims language, but it's repetitive and annoying instead of charming.  The jokes are all tired parodies of hospital dramas like ER.  Try Roller Coaster Tycoon instead.			"

												I've read the negative reviews, so I lowered my expectation and bought it on sale. I thought it would just be similar to the hospital (doctor career) in The Sims 4, but this game is even slower (very awkward control, indeed) and I hate it when I lost my modified room in the next episode. The only cool thing in this game is the first person view. The drama is horrible (trying to be Grey's Anatomy, but...). That's it. I can't even force myself to play for 2 hours.			"

												it is one more game of the family tycoon.In this game you have to create a hospital with the idea of taking care of people and discover what is the problem that they have.I personally believe that the tycoon games are a good game to buy.I like them (especially the ones in which you have to deal with a zoo)			"

												It's more or less a medical sims game. I'm not a big fan. I wish you could turn off voices of the characters. They're quite unpleasant to listen to. They aren't speaking any language. It's just like adult baby babble. If you like the Sims you might like this game. If not, then I doubt it.			"

												Overview: Hospital Tycoon is a game in which you run a hospital that you recently overtook. There isnt really much to say, the entire gameplay is in the game. Pros: I've got nothing.Cons:Feels like a rip off of an old game called Theme Hospital. Same idea of building hospital rooms and making your hospital better, however it seems less well implimented. When you complete an ""episode"" (which follows tired hospital drama tropes), all your progress is reset and new stuff is put in place instead. Following the last con, the game doesnt give you a sense of doing anything. Anything you accomplished in the last episode like building a new opperation room over the windows because why not is gone in the next episode.The whole episode thing in general. The episodes are too short for me to like them as a feature. If the episodes were longer than like.... 10 minutes, it'd be good. For a game that tries hard to be a ~*cool hospital drama*~ it even fails at that mark, making it a bland game to play. I'm surpised I managed to put as long as I did into it. If my purchase of this game hadnt of gone to charity I'd want a refund.			"

												Pros: easy gameplay compared to theme hospital, interesting diseases, good set up.cons: Three hospitals only. Gave me about three hours worth of gameplay in total. Few bugs caused issues, the storyline was predictable and not being able to just skip the videos was ridiculous. It is a good quick game, I think my kids would like it.

												First of all i never Write review's for games, but this game disappointet me, so badly i just had to.First of all, i think most people who buy this game, buy it because they remember the olds classic. Theme hospital.That layout and the basic gameplay of hospital tycoon, reminds of the original, but that's that. Theme hospital had much more depht and enjoyment of gameplay, then this cheap copy.I think the developers where on the right track from the start, but it feels like they just suddenly quit, when they reached the point where the game where ""demo playable"". and sadly the hole game gets this feel of ""demo"".so if you liked the original game don't buy this game, it's not even 4,49euro worthalso there is as fault in the game where you won't really get any patient's in sandbox mode ""maybe 5-9 people"", Not even with a 5 star hospital, Wich is the best you can get. And the developer, wrote from the start that they did not want to correct this error			"
