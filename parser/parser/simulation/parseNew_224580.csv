												DayZ is a mod for Arma 2 that turns the base game into a zombie survival simulator. DayZ is one of the most detailed, if not the most detailed, and immersive zombie survival sims available. When you play DayZ, you create a character and spawn on a beach with nothing but your clothes and from there you have to make your way inland and try to find the tools you need to fend off the undead and to survive in this new world. Generally you are looking for things such as a melee weapon, medical supplies, light sources, food and you might even be lucky enough to find a gun or camping gear.As you make your way through formerly populated areas like villages, farms and the three large cities, you will run into hordes of zombies that you will have to deal with. You can lose them by running into buildings or otherwise breaking line of sight with them. But the zombies are actually not the real threat in this game; the biggest potential threat comes from the other players who are attempting to survive just like you. Some of them will try to help you or trade with you, but usually in exchange for something of equal value, or if you are both being attacked by zombies or other players and you band together out of desperation. Most players though, are bandits, which you can tell by their clothes and covered faces. These players are out for your blood, and only want the stuff they can loot off your dead body.You want to be very cautious in approaching other survivors that you do not know in DayZ because a lot of bandit groups will try to bait victims by having one of their number pose as a ""friendly"" and then when the victim runs over to trade or help, the rest of the bandits ambush him or her. Players in this game have gotten very paranoid in the last year and a half, and so a lot of times players will shoot each other on sight rather than risk losing their gear to a potential bandit.So what do you actually do in DayZ once you have your basic weapons and tools needed to survive? Well you want to find a safe place that you can use as a home base. Generally you want to be far away from areas frequented by zombies, so somewhere in the woods usually. You want to be close enough to a town that you can raid it for supplies every few hours but far enough that zombies and players will have a difficult time tracking you home.Once you have your things safely stashed, the best thing you can do is band together with your friends or any friendly people on the server you can find and get a vehicle. A bicycle is great for solo scout and loot missions to town, but a car, truck or SUV will provide cover from bullets, a large inventory and quick transport for multiple people. Focus on getting the necessary car parts you will need to fix up one of the junked cars you find laying around. After that, once you get enough loot and establish a territory, you can even build a house in some versions of DayZ and barricade it against zeds and meddlesome players.At some point you will get into a fight with another player. Most of the time these fights aren't fair. Maybe a group of players rolled up on you while you were looting and shot you as you came out of a house. Other times you'll follow someone and not realize that they have friends with them and their friends flank and kill you, or you just get shot by someone while you are running from zombies that have aggroed you. All of these things will happen to you on a regular basis, and since everything stays on your corpse when you die, chances are they will loot and take your stuff. But other times you get lucky and you kill a guy with a huge gun that you need because you were lucky enough to catch him with his pants down. So now you have a big gun, and then when you go around the side of the house he was in, you find his giant military truck full of more guns and supplies. Now you are a zombie slaying god and you can bring all of that back to your base. It is very easy to either get very, very mad at this game and ragequit or try to keep deaths in perspective, play smart and take all the opportunities you get. If you are observant and patient in every situation you will do well. If you run into a building without checking the surroundings for players watching or for zombies that will attract attention to you, you will die a lot. If you take your time and all necessary precautions you will catch somebody making a mistake and profit from it, and continue to survive the apocalypse.			"

												First life in the game. I got kidnapped and all my stuff was taken. While the guy was walking away i hear gunshots. Russian guy comes up to me and gives me my stuff back. He doesn't speak a word of english and we team up. We were the heroes of the server, saving noobs and killing bandits. We were next to a group of bandits and the Russian guys goes up to them. I'm hiding in the house and I hear gunshots. There was no way he survived. Someone walked around the door and I blasted them. It was the Russian guy. I was apologizing and he said in broken english ""It ok, we make mistakes"" and died. I almosted cried and I never played again. Rip russian guy 2k15-2k16.EDIT: This was on my friends computer because mine is trash			"

												DayZ Epoch Namalsk Gameplay:


YouTube™ Video:  

			Views: 0		



Important Notice:There are currently over 2,000 servers[dz.launcher.eu], but this Steam download alone won't be enough to connect to the vast majority of them. Most servers require additional mods and maps. You'll get an error and fail to connect if you are missing mods. DayZ launchers are free utilities that solve this issue. I highly recommend using one to make installing mods and connecting to servers much easier.Server list by country: http://arma2.swec.se/server/listIf you are new to DayZ before installing a launcher make sure to run Steam.exe as an Admin and then install and play Arma 2 and Arma 2 OA once each to complete installation (part of the installation occurs when playing the games). Next install a launcher to download mods and connect to servers:dayzlauncher.com - All DayZ Modswithsix.com - All Arma Mods (official)survivallauncher.com - Arma 2 & 3 + Arkcustomcombatgaming[customcombatgaming.com] - CCG DayZ Serversdayzcommander.com - All DayZ Mods (currently not working)See: Newbie Guide to DayZ LaunchersPlease note that you will not be able to connect to any server until you have fully downloaded the mods necessary for that server. Vanilla DayZ is only about 500MB, but others like Epoch are 2.6GB and will take quite a while to download. Maps are also fairly large, for example Namalsk is an additional 800MB and Taviana is 1.2GB. The good news is all these mods and maps are completely free! Check the Mods tab of your launcher to view the status of your downloads before trying to connect.Interactive DayZ Mod loot maps: http://dayzdb.com/map/chernarusScreenshot after building my first DayZ Epoch base, a long time ago in a galaxy far far away (all that wood was chopped down by hand with axes!): http://i.imgur.com/88nBhSC.jpgDayZ Mod is one of the most interesting, exciting and immersive games I've ever played. It's basically a multiplayer apocalyptic virtual world or sandbox without any quests or story-line unless created by the players themselves. You go where you want and do as you want. You determine everything that happens except for the response from other players. You can be a bandit or hero engaging in constant gun battles in the busier towns or you can run off into the wilderness and build yourself a cabin in the middle of nowhere and hunt to survive. There are very few limits on what you can do.DayZ Epoch (mod) Building & Craftinghttp://epochmod.gamepedia.com/Modular_Building_Systemhttp://epochmod.gamepedia.com/Crafting_SystemI prefer DayZ Mod over DayZ Standalone for several reasons. One of the coolest things about the Mod is that it's essentially a game with hundreds of free expansions and DLCs. Because it's not centrally controlled and developed by a single dev team it offers many different types of games, maps, custom mods, play styles i.e PvP, PvE, RP, and game improvements for free from hundreds of players and community developers and continues to evolve in many alternative directions. Most mods are open source and you can modify them or help develop and improve them yourself. There are Hunger Games type mods to play like Battle Royal where it's everyone for themselves and you fight to be the last one standing, militarized mods like Overwatch full of heavy military weapons, aircraft and tanks, crafting and base building type mods like Epoch and Origins that allow you to more permanently carve out your own piece of the world and make it your home, survival type mods like vanilla DayZ, and even alien mods like Invasion. With the Mod there are so many different options and environments available for play that you're bound to find a server that suits you and if you don't you can even set up your own server and customize it just the way you like. That will likely never happen to the same degree with the Standalone.800 free mods are available for Arma 2: http://withsix.com/p/arma-2/modsThe Mod is also much cheaper than Standalone. Arma 2 Combined Operations and Arma X Anniversary keys can be bought for about $5 and $8 each, just search Google for keys or wait for a sale. Not only do you pay less and get dozens of different games and options for play, but you also get the original Arma 2 combat simulator games too, which are award winning games themselves.Overall, DayZ Mod is a must have if you enjoy PC gaming. Many games are trying to imitate DayZ Mod now, but nothing really compares so far and it will probably remain that way simply because free DayZ mods are community developed by those purely passionate about making cool mods and games while everything else is being developed primarily for profit.If you need help installing or connecting send me a friend request and I'll try to help.

												The DayZ mod is still a better game by far than SA DayZ. There are very few remaining bugs and the balance between survival, zombies, vehicles and PvP has been tweaked to make this game challenging and competitive. I recommend playing this game on a Vanilla server rather than Epoch or ""goodies"" servers because everything you find, steal and kill for is that much more valuable to you than if it's handed right over when you spawn. Spawn, loot, kill or die and repeat. But remember, we're all gonna die sooner or later. It's just a matter of time...:-)			"

												Two tips: 1. ""Don't get too fond of your gear"".... You are going to lose it. All of it. Many times.2. Elekrovadask is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ where you will usually meet a sticky end. Its a free mod. But If you are going to buy Arma2 and OA just to play the mod, proceed with caution. You need to install and set it up very carefully and use DZLauncher or it probably won't work ""out of the box"".   (NOTE: DayZ Commander is now out of date)It is built on a military simulator engine, and there is a fairly sharp learning curve, it may take a while to find a regular server that plays the style of DayZ that you like (ranging from solo survivalist in the woods PvE to relentless PVP and everything between the two extremes)It is NOT a ""run and Gun"" game. Its about stealth, walking, sneaking, surviving the hard way, and the highs and lows of living moment to moment.There are bugs, and gliches.  You will either be able to overlook these and enjoy the game, or they'll drive you mad.Under the surface there is a very good community. Although dismissed my many in the Arma2 community as ""whiny trolls from DayZ"" there are plenty of us who play both the mil-sim and the DayZ variants of Arma2. DayZ is not for everyone. It may take you a while to find a server you like, with an FPS that works, and a decent anti-cheat on it. But there are servers for everyone, from Pure PVP, to Pure PvE, and everything in between including servers witth hostile/friendly AI, and mods-on-mod like Epoch and Origins.TL/DR: do your research first: there are no half measures in DayZ, you will either love it or hate it.

												Hallelujiah, the Apocalypse has arrived. (TL:DR at bottom)I bought into DayZ StandAlone last year. For a year I've been trying to participate in and enjoy, that game, and rarely have I walked away pleased. The glitches, hackers and terrible zoombie mechanics left me disappointed too many times to recommend StandAlone.When I saw Arma 2 Complete go on sale for less than $9 I had serious reservations about giving Bohemia any more of my money, but I really wanted a DayZ experience the devs have promised me dang rabbit!So, I pulled the trigger and purchased Arma 2 Complete and immediately kissed the rest of the games in my library goodbye!Set-up wasn't easy, I was plauged by the error messages seen everywhere in the forums by recent puchasers of the same set, but with some patience, determination and a LOT of reading I was able to overcome the BattleEye bugs and, again, with some little annoyances I also got DayZ Commander set up and the Epoch & Overwatch mods installed..now, what about this DayZ mod?My time is recorded through Arma 2 OA so since purchasing Thursday so I'm closer to 15 hours in and it's been absolutely AMAZING. DayZ Mod was the experience I was hoping SA would bring me and never did. I've had more intense, blood curdling, panic-inducing moments in DayZ Mod than any other game on my steam list.The Zombie AI, imo, is the best on Steam. Coming from a pretty hefty zombie/survival/open-world gaming list, DZM provides more thrills than 7DTD, The Forest, The Dead Linger etc. The pathfinding is superb, the animations are great, the sounds are excellent. They provide a real atmosphere of tense-horror at just the right time.The one big issue in SA (out of many, believe me) is the zombies are still broken. The have x-ray vision which stretches miles, can run through a lot of obstacles and are very hard to ""lose"", imo. The zoms in DZM act exactly like I would expect zombies to act. I can't explain to you the joy I felt when I was crouched in the ditch of a road, night settling over me, with two lumbering Zeds slowly shambling my way having yet still notice me. Staying extremely still, not breathing IRL, I remained crouched as these two denizens of the undead proceeded to ramble past me, mere INCHES from my face, without knwoing I was there. One wrong move or sound from me and I was Zombie Dinner! I've been waiting for that experience for a long time, through a lot of games, and it was a joy to finally see it realized.Installing DayZ commander and getting at least Epoch and Overwatch working (out of a lot of other intense mods) are almost tantamount to give you the DayZ experience you are looking for. They add so much flavour to the game including trading posts, custom building and crafting (up to massive bases), wandering AI, including Bandits, which add SO much flair to the game, roaming bandits, Aircraft Bandits...truckloads driving from village to village looking for hapless victims to strip them off their gear and sell them at the nearest vendor. The different MODS through Commander add new maps, missions within the game (find an Alpha zombie, kill a scientist for a cure, find a downed plane for it's supplies); plus many servers have their own lore and stories built within the game. Basically you can tailor you Apocalypse scenario any way you want...creating the experience you want.Graphically I find the MOD looks almost exactly like the SA, and plays very smooth. I have a mid-grade pc and on the server I have picked as my favorite so far I have been getting FPS in the 50's, which is great for my machine (I'm used to 30 FPS for a lot of games), so technically it isn't as demanding as I thought it might be.If you are turned off by a lot of buttons then DayZ may not be for you. It is very demanding in it's use of the keyboard, utilizing a lot of keystrokes for the experience. If you're new to this structure then allow for extra time in-game to really get a feel of the flow, but once you're used to it there is no denying how satisfying it is being able to use 4 buttons at once to scope out around corners, or scan far off to the North while feverishly running South.The Gear screen is a little confusing to me still, as I'm still fiddling with how different items work together, and I haven't even begun to touch crafting or building. But running around a few servers with player made creations shows that the system is deep and immersive. There are a lot of clans out there that have spent hundreds of hours building, scavenging for parts and building a community within the game. The nice thing is, especially through DayZ Commander, you can find as casul or hardcore an experience as you wish.I haven't come across any bugs or glitches in my almost 15 hours of play or so, not that I'm saying it's perfect, but coming from SA to the Mod I was expecting it to be a horrid, buggy mess, so I have been very pleasantly surprised with the fluidity of the game and it's contents. I have tested in many types of servers, full PVP and PVE, and have been lucky to have picked really incredible community servers, so griefing and KOS'ing (so far) have been a non-issue for me, but I do a lot of research on servers before hopping in. What I did find nice was with the addition of Bandit AI, even in  a server that's PVE with no one but me on it, the threat from man is JUST as palpable as the threat from zombies. It's quite a thrill to run into a village looking for supplies and taking out a zombie population with a silenced pistol, freely exploring buildings, and at any moment hearing the sounds of a truck coming around a corner, running to hide in a a building JUST before the headlights light you up, and watch as  5 bandits jump from a truck, fully armed, going from building to building, shooting anything they see. It's exhilarating and challenging, but in no way breaks immersion or the feeling of Apocalyptic Doom.If you can get this package on sale it's a HUGE bonus. But, to be honest, now that I'm in DayZ Mod and experiencing the thrill of DayZ as I was hoping I would have had over a year ago, the retail asking price of the package is completely worth it. For now, I am am uninstalling my DayZ Standalone, saying a silent prayer for all the games on my list that I won't touch for many months to come, and immersing myself in the Zombie Apocalypse game I have always wanted and now have found. :)TL:DR; An immersive experience that blows away it's struggling little brother DayZ Standalone. Worth the price (especially on sale), and the finest example of a Zombie Apocalypse game on Steam yet. If you can get past the installation issues and have the patience to get DayZ Coammander up and running, then this game is unparallelled.			"

												Although steam says I haven't played this game much, I've put about 1000-2000 hours in total using DayZ Commander. Now, being based of a Military Sim. There is some amazing gun play, tactics and all around great fun to be had. Although there are some very bad bugs and glitches. If its not glitching off a ladder and dying or lagging through walls. (Every hardcore DayZ player has had this happen to them.) Its also got a very steap learning curve. Don't let that turn you off to the game though. DayZ is all about a game based around survival. Your set in a place in Russia, so anyone who doesn't know how to read russian is gonna have alittle harder time remembering the towns. (Although after 10 or so hours, it isn't hard.) Your set in the middle of nowhere with next to nothing. You have no objective except survive the zombie infested island. You have no idea where to go, so you start running, you found a house! Grab the beans, soda and pistol of the ground. Suddenly your a threat. You meet another player, a not so friendly one at that. People call him many names, but the most common. Bandit. He wants your items, are you going to get shot, or survive. Either by running or taking the fight to him. Now, that we're done with the little story. Back to the review d:Yes, considering it is a mod. There are going to be bugs, and more then likely you WILL get mad. Its only normal. Some annoying bugs are -- Getting one hit by zombies and dying- Glitching off ladders and dying or breaking legs- Reloging and your items be missing from inventory- Glitching through walls- Zombies hitting you through walls- Zombies having horrible pathing - Zombies glitching though floorsThose are some annoying bugs, that happen normaly. But if you can look past that, there is a silver lining. Once you get passed the bugs you find an amazing experence. Just image finding a friendly group of people, running up north, getting end-game loot and finding another squad of people and having a huge gun fight. Like I said before, the gun play is amazing. So naturaly so are the gun fights. Then you find a heli, go help freshspawns or kill them(Hero/bandit), then a rogue sniper takes all you guys out. Its fun. But I highly recommend you get some friends, get on skype/teamspeak/vent etc etc and play that way, as its much more enjoyable and way easier.If your brand new to DayZ here are some beginner tips - - G = Gear- / on numpad - Changing optics on weapons- Q , E - Lean left and right- Right click to aim- Hold right click to zoom (can do while aiming)- There is no autorun feature- Z , X , C = Changing Stance- . and , = Changing channel to talk- / not on numpad to talk- Capslock - Voice chatThose are gonna be some basics your gonna need to know. Well, I hope this review helped out atleast slightly. I fully recommend this game. Just remember. Its ok to get mad. . . Cause you will, I promise. :PEDIT - This game is also very badly rendered. Meaning, anyone who doesn't have a decent computer are going to have trouble running this game. Although not impossible, you will have to get used to it. I get a solid 30 fps and about 15-20 in large citys. Which isn't very good. But its playable. Just like the bugs, if you can get passed that. There are many adventures that await you in the DayZ.

												A Mod based off the Military Simulator, ARMA II. This mod is brilliant, because it simulates very well what would it be like if you were left behinfd in an apocalypse. This game has a huge ""mods in a mod"" modding scene, the map is HUGE (15 square kilometers), and you'll feel like you're there when you play this. Beware two things. One, this is not for the faint of heart. Two, this is NOT OPTIMIZED. So if you don't care about having the highest FPS, here you are then. But if you do, I would wait until the Day-Z Standalone comes out, which is on its way.Bottom line though, Highly recommended besides those two issues, but mentailly preapre yourself! Also, watching 28 Days Later helps with this too :P			"

I have had alot of fun, and hope that this encourages you to look into getting it.			"

												This in my Opinion is the greatest Mod for a game ever known coming right up next to garry mod and killing floor and other such as that, this mod is a Open world Survival Horror Strataagy game that takes the player into a beautiful large map with other survivors to pretty much survive the zombie Apocolypse, this includes- Eating Food ((There is also rotten food you cannot eat and animals you can hunt cook and eat for better results))- Drinking ((Water, Coke, Pepsi, Mountin Dew, Ect))- Stealth (( Stealth is a huge part of this game, you simply cannot go in guns blazing, zombies and player will hear you see you and KILL you))- Stratagy ((In DayZ combat it is nothing like CoD, you must avoid getting shot at all costs, getting shot will knock you out or break a limb. getting shot will also make you bleed and be in shock, to fix this you will have to take pain killers to stop you character from shaking, bandage your wounds, Morphine can be used for broken Limbs, blood bags will help regain colour to your screen and also stop your player from falling in and out of coma but on some servers may only be applied by other players))- People Skills ((Some people will kill on sight others will be friends, in order to survive you must know the difference))- Enviroment ((You also must make sure not to get too hot nor cold))This Mod has come so far, it now has its own standalone in witch i reviewed and multiple versions of the mod, popular ones areDayZDayZ EpochDayZ OverpochDayZ 2017This is a very well thought out mod and does a amazing job.My personal Suggesed PC SpecsCPU- Intel Quod CoreRAM- 4Gb min ((Recommend 8Gb, 16Gb is over kill and not needed))Graphics- 1Gb Nvidia Gforce ((if you have better this will be good))In conclusion i do recomend this game %100. :)			"

												DayZ is a mod for Arma 2 that turns the base game into a zombie survival simulator. DayZ is one of the most detailed, if not the most detailed, and immersive zombie survival sims available. When you play DayZ, you create a character and spawn on a beach with nothing but your clothes and from there you have to make your way inland and try to find the tools you need to fend off the undead and to survive in this new world. Generally you are looking for things such as a melee weapon, medical supplies, light sources, food and you might even be lucky enough to find a gun or camping gear.As you make your way through formerly populated areas like villages, farms and the three large cities, you will run into hordes of zombies that you will have to deal with. You can lose them by running into buildings or otherwise breaking line of sight with them. But the zombies are actually not the real threat in this game; the biggest potential threat comes from the other players who are attempting to survive just like you. Some of them will try to help you or trade with you, but usually in exchange for something of equal value, or if you are both being attacked by zombies or other players and you band together out of desperation. Most players though, are bandits, which you can tell by their clothes and covered faces. These players are out for your blood, and only want the stuff they can loot off your dead body.You want to be very cautious in approaching other survivors that you do not know in DayZ because a lot of bandit groups will try to bait victims by having one of their number pose as a ""friendly"" and then when the victim runs over to trade or help, the rest of the bandits ambush him or her. Players in this game have gotten very paranoid in the last year and a half, and so a lot of times players will shoot each other on sight rather than risk losing their gear to a potential bandit.So what do you actually do in DayZ once you have your basic weapons and tools needed to survive? Well you want to find a safe place that you can use as a home base. Generally you want to be far away from areas frequented by zombies, so somewhere in the woods usually. You want to be close enough to a town that you can raid it for supplies every few hours but far enough that zombies and players will have a difficult time tracking you home.Once you have your things safely stashed, the best thing you can do is band together with your friends or any friendly people on the server you can find and get a vehicle. A bicycle is great for solo scout and loot missions to town, but a car, truck or SUV will provide cover from bullets, a large inventory and quick transport for multiple people. Focus on getting the necessary car parts you will need to fix up one of the junked cars you find laying around. After that, once you get enough loot and establish a territory, you can even build a house in some versions of DayZ and barricade it against zeds and meddlesome players.At some point you will get into a fight with another player. Most of the time these fights aren't fair. Maybe a group of players rolled up on you while you were looting and shot you as you came out of a house. Other times you'll follow someone and not realize that they have friends with them and their friends flank and kill you, or you just get shot by someone while you are running from zombies that have aggroed you. All of these things will happen to you on a regular basis, and since everything stays on your corpse when you die, chances are they will loot and take your stuff. But other times you get lucky and you kill a guy with a huge gun that you need because you were lucky enough to catch him with his pants down. So now you have a big gun, and then when you go around the side of the house he was in, you find his giant military truck full of more guns and supplies. Now you are a zombie slaying god and you can bring all of that back to your base. It is very easy to either get very, very mad at this game and ragequit or try to keep deaths in perspective, play smart and take all the opportunities you get. If you are observant and patient in every situation you will do well. If you run into a building without checking the surroundings for players watching or for zombies that will attract attention to you, you will die a lot. If you take your time and all necessary precautions you will catch somebody making a mistake and profit from it, and continue to survive the apocalypse.			"

												(This is For DayZ: Epoch, because lets be real, who the f**k still plays normal Mod)It may look a little dated and be a bit buggy, but DayZ Epoch is better than Standalone in every single possible way, except maybe Arma 2s appaling inventory system.Set a little while after the Apocalypse, Epoch sees society slowly being rebuilt, so there is more of a focus in faction forming and base building and the like rather than surviving, trader cities are on the map where you can go to sell weapons/equipment/food for small chunks of Copper, silver and gold, each with increasing value respectivley. The player can actually purchase ammo/weapons/food/Helicopters/cars/equipment from NPC's without having to find it which in my oppinion is alot better. However, as mentioned above, you need currrency to buy these things. So in order to do that, you need to either scavenge or go do bandit missions.Scvenging is almost completley redundant but is ALOT safer than bandit missions, bandit missions are small waypoints on the map where the player and his m8s can kill NPC bandits and take their supplies to sell, this is VERY dangerous because the bandits usually number from 10-25. HOWEVER it is worth it as you can get a lifetime supply of guns/ammo and maybe even a car, that is unless another player doesnt get there first, or shoots you while you scavenge the NPC bodies. Keep in mind, one stray STANNAG round (most common type) can cripple you if not kill you, so be careful, bandit missions are best done with friends.Unlike Standalone, Epoch has a humanity system which increases as you heal and help other players, and decreases rapidly upon injuring or killing another, once 5000 or negative 5000 humanity is reached, the player becomes a hero (positive) or a bandit (negative) once one of the two, the player can travel to hero/bandit traders that sell increadibly more powerful gear (Kevlar vests, Armoured cars, Armed Helicopters, and even on some servers, tanks) This is why people on Epoch are generally more friendly because having postive humanity can get them to Hero status and thus better gear.It takes a while, but you can build massive bases from scratch to house all your items, these can be as simple as small, well fortified bunkers, to massive sprawling fortresses complete with three helipads and a airoplane runway.Overall, Epoch can be tedious, but with friends it is a blast. Bandit missions are one of the highlightes of the game, and returning from a succesful one with your car loaded with guns to your very own base is an amazing feeling. Any fans of the Walking dead series or any other zombie production ever will love this game. A must buy.P.S Be prepared, The distant rumble of a armoured car engine, or the growl of an armed blackhawk will never sound scarier, especially when its headed towards your location.			"

How to Install DayZ Mod 2016Favorite Vid (DayZ Overpoch Taviana)


YouTube™ Video: WAR! - Arma 2: DayZ Mod - Ep.50 

			Views: 2,777,621		

			One man with a sniper rifle, 2 harriers and a car with a gatling gun on! Join me on CCG servers!: http://goo.gl/udvYBs A big thankyou to all those who helped me record the cinematics, especially...		

InstallationIf you haven't installed anything yet make sure you are on a Windows Admin account and simply install Arma 2 and Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead (OA). Do not install the Steam DayZ mod. Before you do anything else play Arma 2 once and exit, then play Arma 2 OA once and exit, in that order. Then download dayzlauncher.com install it and run it. If all your game files are on your main C: drive then all you need to do is click the arrow button on the right side next to any server and the mods for that server will be detected and begin downloading. Some of the mods like Epoch are up to 3 GB in size and will take a while to download before you can actually connect. You can view the status of your mods and downloads by clicking the Mods page near the top of dayzlauncher. To start playing quickly you might want to start with plain old vanilla DayZ since it is only .5 GB - to see only vanilla DayZ servers select DayZ in the selection box on the left side of dayzlauncher and then click the Apply button. NOTE: do not install the old DayZ mod on Steam as it may cause conflicts.If you have multiple drives make sure to change your game folders in Dayzlauncher. Click Settings in the top right. The default location for your Mods/Download Path is your Arma 2 OA folder, typically: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Arma 2 Operation ArrowheadThe Arma 2 Path is where you installed Arma 2, typically: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Arma 2TroubleshootingUsually problems are caused by having ♥♥♥♥ed up Windows folder permissions. Make sure you install the game on a Windows Admin account. If your installation is screwed up try reinstalling this way:1. Uninstall everything and delete the following folders:C:\Users\[username]\Documents\ArmA 2C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\ArmA 2C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\ArmA 2 OAC:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Arma 2C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead2. Right click and run steam.exe (not the icon) as an Admin it's located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam3. Install Arma 2 and Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead.4. As Admin play Arma 2 and then exit. Next, play Operation Arrowhead and then exit.5. Install dayzlauncher.com (see above for usage). Do not install DayZ Mod on Steam.TipsIn Dayzlauncher settings check Nosplash, Nopause, and Nologs to load and run the game faster.DayZ Epoch servers are usually the easiest for beginners because they have high loot and NPC traders.If you don't like PvP search Dayzlauncher for PVE, RP, or Roleplay.Zombies chase noisy players. Crouch to make less noise and crawl to make almost no noise. Melee weapons are quiet.The branches of pine trees and large bushes will protect you from zombie attacks.One of the first things you need is storage. Create or get a stash, crate, backpack, or tent as soon as possible.You can drink out of ponds and wells with a chance of infection. Boil water using a tin can, waterbottle and fire.An axe is one of the most useful items. You can quitely kill zombies with it and chop wood for crafting storage and bases.More to come...			"

												I'm going to be honest here. 2 or 1 year ago I wouldn't have recommended this mod. As this mod is brilliant and phenomenal it has been very unstable since it was relased early 2013. The concept sounded cool but back then DayZ had dozens of issues which prevented me playing and enjoying this otherwise so supreme title. Glitching zombies, clumsy and buggy user interference and constant uncertainity of losing everything you had collected caused by server crash were serious problems. However - what could one expect from the free mod for players of ARMA2 and ARMA2: Operation Arrowhead?Fortunantly DayZ mod has grown these past years. With the help of active community it has gotten various new maps, the UI have been enchanted and is much more easier and safer to use. Third party management programs such as DayZ launcher and DayZ Commander have done indispensable work releasing players of most of the updating burden. Of course this mod still isn't flawless and some annoying surprices happen every now and then, but considering how well it has gotten upgreaded these last years I say the future looks encouraging. DayZ mod prospers and lives well and dozens of servers have always players to keep the game hectic and interesting where - or when ever you play. DayZ mod is still one of the greatest survival, open world titles in the world and at the moment imo it is DayZ standalone's superior.			"

												I used to play DayZ Mod by running it off Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead, hence the low ""game play"" time on this version.I miss the old Mod.Now the Mod is destroyed by hackers and destroyed by the Admins of the servers adding custom buildings, adding more weapons, making it easier to gain weapons, and of course adding something stupid like 1,000 vehicles per server. What's the point in that??????The Mod was good when weapons were hard(ish) to get, you had to go to good places like Stary Sobor Military Tents, or NW Airfield, or even Balota Airfield. Finding vehicles was something that was a challenge. Finding scrap metal, finding wheels, jerry cans etc. Now you can pretty much find a fully fixed vehicle anywhere.The times when you had shoot outs at NW Airfield, Stary Sobor, Helicopter Crash sites etc. Now you don't get that often.Miss them times.I do recommend the game as it is fun to play, well I don't find it AS fun anymore simply because the servers have been destroyed.I'd like the old DayZ Mod back.

												This is up there in my Top 3 Best Mods of all time. Easily.The changes made to the base game aren't earth-shattering, and upon close inspection of how those changes are implemented, it quickly becomes appearent how simple and rudimentary thier construction is in most cases. The changes are basically achieved with what amounts to a digital ""spiral notebook and some still photographs of new textures"". But with those simple tools, the cats behind DayZ:Mod have really sunk thier teeth in and hit the zombie survival nail on the head.This isn't your ""L4D: KILL IT ALL! KILL IT ALL WITH FIRE!"" button masher. With DayZ being built ontop of what can be classified as no less than a tried and true ""Military Personell Simulator"" (without even a fraction of the paper work and ten times the unaccounted-for munitions.)When I played EVE Online, I figured it would be many years before I saw a game even pretend to compare to the treachery it inspires in its player-base. But DayZ may have perhaps surpassed the deceit of EVE. Not in scale (the scale of player-betrayal in EVE is second to none) but in how immediate, and visceral it is force-fed to new players. And its a self-sustaining beast, since players who were initiated so cruely, tend to turn around and laugh harder and be more cruel to the next guys. And this can really ruin games like this, and can instantly rob people of thier entire evening of what they thought would be enjoyable play time to test out some of the mechanics, and replace that with having to wade through the mud and the rain for five miles back to thier corpse. After having been mercilessly made fun of as if we were born yesterday for not knowing an entire wiki cover-to-cover on our first day, and simply wanting to talk, make new friends, and leave some of the game to be discovered naturally through first hand experience. I'm often made fun of for my stand-point here, and ridiculed with ""Aww, poor baby doesn't like dying."" I genuinely don't mind dying. In fact it can spawn some really fun and exciting nemesis situations between rivaling players. But a line has to be drawn, players should be given a chance to get thier feet wet, grasp the mechanics, or survive long enough to see thier buddy(s) log in to play together. Don't feed the beast guys...work together...even if you aren't on the same team. Theres no reason to be inconsiderate or rude. If you don't understand this concept and it seems contradictory to  you, give it a couple years, wait till puberty ends. You'll get it.In the mean time, if you can recruit a friend, or manage to make a new one (in all honesty) there are some incredibly enjoyable mechanics in DayZ, with the backdrop of an often gorgeous and engrossing environment that I often find myself just kick my characters legs out on the side of a hill and watching the rainstorm. Very few games have been good-looking enough to make me wanna do that, but Arma2:OA is definitely one of them, as well as DayZ.If anyone has trouble surviving the plethora of errors and installation pitfalls, I'm usually willing to offer any help I can. And if you're interested in joining a group / server with me, I'm always on the look out for mature, calm players that enjoy the cooperative prospects of online games like this. Even the most knowledgeable and technically savvy players will require quite a bit of help in grasping / manipulating one of the most UN-intuitive interfaces I've ever seen, again easily comparable to the GrandCanyon'esque ""learning curve"". And even if you've been warned of everything that can and will go wrong, things will still stop you in your tracks and have you scratching your head. Many of the in-game menus are a bit convoluted, much of the environment is in Russion, and many things often have an almost ""unfinished"" feel to them. But that being said, I can admiringly say that the good certainly out-weighs the bad in my book. Just don't come alone ;) Bring a friend. Buy an extra copy or two. And work through it together. It's definitely not a 12 year olds CoD weekend-warrior FPS game.This is a cruel, harsh, unforgiving, cursed mod for an already teeth-grindingly difficult simulator of sorts. But with a little luck, and a helping hand (trust NO ONE for your first entire week, no matter what) maybe you'll uncovered the addictive, immersive, awesome-fest of DayZ			"

												In a world of so few friends, I begin to realize that we dont get to choose our friends, we dont get to decide how they act, and worse of all how that comradre is severed. There was probably a better way, but bordering on almost 20 hours with about 4 hours sleep, my mind was frazzled and couldnt see a better alternative.just 15 or so hours earlier, we had been a tightly knit unit. laughing, argueing, and generally enjoying ourselves. But one certain problem began to crop up in the group, with a specific person. There was a systematic failure to communicate. As gear began to dissapear, it was obvious, very obvious, who was stealing it. Finally when a ghillie suit disappeared, and this individual claimed to have found it in a barn, the level of distrust was pushed over the line by the lies. lies told well are one thing, but lies as transparent as this spoke to how little he thought of our intelligence. We discussed what we should do in a seperate message on steam.......................................................................................................................................I didn't pull the trigger my self, in fact, i didnt even hear the shots go off. But as i fortified my base, i also saw him leave, i hadn't even been sure when it would happen. Just as i finished making my base sealed off, i saw the words.Wolfy was killedEerie as ♥♥♥♥ for a brief secondfollowed by the exasperated sounding words ""Dude.....What the ♥♥♥♥?""The conversation that ensued was that reminiscient of an ugly Divorce. I didn't speak much during this, But he was presented with the facts. He denied these vehemently, trying to blame others. He claimed he had no choice but to kill us, now. After awhile of this i spoke up and agreed with the triggerman, he had crossed a line. the conversation degraded into denials and insults. There was nothing else to do but hang up and delete him from steam.As our reality begun to settle around us, the impact of what we had done hit us full force. the person we had spent almost 20 consecutive hours with, looting, shooting the♥♥♥♥♥♥ and even executed several well coordinated operations with, was dead. not the kind of dead where, when he respawns he'll just meet us at base. no, this felt real. it felt real because we knew him. we knew him on a personal level. the diffrence between killing someone with whom ive never had extended interaction with, and killing wolfy was monumental. It felt real. As we discussed it and dissected what it was,and how wierd we felt, we came back to one amazing fact. An amazing fact that we have always known, one that sharply blew our minds. it was so obvious. This is a video game. How? Just How? we began to discuss that too. After having disscussed at depth for about an hour, we slowly went back to our normal habits. hunting and gathering supplies. wolfy was out of our minds soon after. However he is still in the back of our minds, and this morning after three hours of sleep i feel heart broken. I Very much expect that wolfy is equally heartbroken, but that this will be masked with rage and un-adult rated vengence. we have to relocate now, and despite this base being a dream come true. i know i cannot fight him off 24/7. i know we cannot undo what we did. words have been exchanged, actions have been taken. So with heavy hearts we pick up and move on, knowing now we have a mortal enemy...................................................................................................................................................................................All in all the level of immersion in this game is second to none. The learning curve is hard. but if you persevere you will find yourself having adventures unique and all their own. sometimes what happens is even more dramatic then any games storyline. bandits suck, yes but if you find the right server, youll have a little wiggle room. start off with smaller servers go big later.

												Day One: Met a guy. Told me a nice story. ""Once there was and ugly freshy. He was so ugly that everyone died."" Then he magically got a M4A1 and blasted my head off.Day Two: I was thinking how people said after you get gear you dont worry about zombies, BS. I was getting chased by 7-9 zombies in Cherno and died later of blood loss.Day Three: Found a helicopter I didn't know how to fly. Decided to turn on autolanding. Had to bail. 10/10 autolanding features.Day Four: Got a huge group of men to follow me around. We got guns, ghilles, and even humvees. We found a heli later on and decided to tow a humvee to it. Exploded and killed us all.TIP FOR NEW PEOPLE: Don't use towing features on servers. Solo play is hard if your planning on it. Always try to stay in a group and out of major towns.			"

												It's terrirfying at times and consistantly unnerving, it's  hard to master as there's always something impeding your progress be it bandits, untrusting/trigger happy survivors, zombies or yourself, i say yourself as it's a game that is very unforgiving in the choices you make. It contains a vast map that seems impossible to learn, only after multiple hours of playtime will you get the lay of the land. Stay on the coastline or head inland? Will you live discreetly from a tent in a forest or openly in a fortified compound?Your morality will be tested, will you be a hero (help survivors) or a bandit (kill survivors)? Will you team up with other people ingame/friends or lone wolf it? But remember obviously there are advantages and disadvantages in whatever options you choose. I highly recommend this game/mod. "

			Views: 4,464,074		

			Welcome to Chernarus. A 225 km2 open world post-soviet state and one of the areas hit by a new and presently unknown infection which has wiped out most of the world's population.		

The correct install of Arma 2 and Battleye is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Here is what works for most:1. Exit Steam. Right click Steam shortcut and select Open file location. Right click on steam.exe and select Run as administrator.2. As Administrator install both Arma 2 and Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead.3. As Administrator play Arma 2 all the way to the multiplayer menu and exit. Then do the same for Operation Arrowhead. Don't skip this!4. Install and run dayzlauncher.comIn Dayzlauncher you can sort the servers by connection speed by clicking on PING at the top right. Click on the play arrow along the right side next to the server you want to join. You will have to click on the Steam icon on your task bar and then click OK on the confirmation window to launch each server. You will also need to wait for mods to download the first time you try to connect to a server and can check the status of downloads by clicking on MODS at the top of dayzlauncher.I recommend playing on a DayZ Epoch or Overpoch server first because most have high loot and vehicle spawns along with NPC traders making it much easier to survive.I'm loving the game!

												 If you're looking for a immersive experience where you can lose everything in an instance for not being carful ( or from falling 2 inches down stairs). This Hardcore game calls players who have patience and an Iron will to deal with the threat of Zombies and the even greater threat of players. I play on an Epoch server and im having the time of my life. I've made trusted teammates and mortal enemies. In this game you're options are almost unlimited: Farm for materials to build a huge base, Test your skills at player killing and become a powerful ""bandit"", or become a ""hero"" and befriend multiple players to create an unstoppable force. I recommend this game to experiences gamers who are looking for a psychological challenge. Both through the game and through the players you meet.			"

												Such a fun game. I never played it during the glory days (2012-13 I suppose), but still now this can thrill and challenge you.On an empty server you can play PVE style, scavenging and hunting which is great fun to begin with, but actually it's far too easy. Once you get the hang of it zombies are no threat - you can just run right by them and into a building where they suddenly become slow for no particular reason, then a quick axe to the head and you're off on your way again.So by all means learn the ropes on an empty server, but get yourself onto a full one asap. The added challenge of other players is what makes this game truly unique and thrilling. You're going to die, a lot, but that's the key point of the game. It takes time to gear up and travel to interesting places, so your character is valuable. The joy you'll feel at finding a water pump when you're thirsty is balanced perfectly with the fear of getting shot by a bandit as you drink. This game can take you on a real roller coaster ride of emotions and heart-stopping moments. Honestly, the first time you get into a car after 50 hours of endless running is just pure joy. Others in these reviews seem intent on bad-mouthing the standalone version of this game. I say get both. They're both great. This version is a simpler one, though its vehicles and the range of weapons is broader. It also has other DayZ-themed mods such as the excellent Epoch (though really that's not DayZ - too easy to get high end gear means less fear of losing it all). The standalone has far deeper mechanics for survival and player interaction which for me provides a richer and more satisfying experience. All buildings are enterable in the standalone and loot is more spread out, all of which means fewer ""hotspots"" in each location - and therefore meeting other people is more random and therefore even more heart-stopping! It also has better, more deadly zombies.			"

												In Dayz you are dropped into a world devastated by a zombie outbreak, the goal of the game is to survive all the elements that you would encounter if this was real life, such as Hunger, Thirst, Temperture and more while at the same time defending yourself from the zombies that roam the land and other survivors that might be trying to kill you for that last can of food. I highly recommend this game to anyone that is a fan of realistic games and/or zombie games. This game is one of the most entertaining games i've played and it is definitely worth the money.			"

												I love this game, simply for the fun you can have with friends.Take DayZ: Standalone, for example. That game isn't even in Beta since 3 years!Arma 2: DayZ is just cool because it's already a finished game! Okay, okay, Arma physics sometimes breaks your legs all of the sudden although you fell from a tabel but ... if we ignore that, this DayZ Mod is fun!,Finding gear and stuff takes you long but after all that's real life. You won't have awesome fire fights 24/7.Why I got this mod? From the beginning, I played this game and it just screams good old memories everytime I see the title in my steam library. The days when you could run around in a Squad with 5 people? The people shouting friendly all over the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ map? Or those times when you found a chopper, laughed your♥♥♥♥♥off when you realise that you're surrounded by zombies AND the chopper is pretty much useless since everything is broken? That moment when you find an awesome sniper rifle, sniping in a town and than realising that there's bullet drop?This Mod is perfect for people who like a realistic approach towards the whole ""Zombie Apocalypse"" Scenario. Betrayal, greed and hostility is everywhere and this just intensifies the overall game experience. You can't trust anyone. ESPECIALLY those who act like Military ... looking at you Lieutenant Dysteriylz! I'm gonna find you ...Also, the ambient sounds are f***ing awesome!			"

The standalone version of Day Z is a disaster, this mod is a million times better than the ""Standalone Version"". And ive read other players reviews on how its hard to find servers? Or its hard to find servers with active people playing? You must have a connection issue because every single time i get on theres atleast 1 or 2 servers almost full of players, and a handful of other servers that are half full or less. Overall, best way to play Day Z is right here on the original mod version.			"

												This is the reason I built a gaming pc. Seeing those awesome Youtube videos of others playing this open world where survival was key hit something possibly primal in me and I had to have a go myself.Still play iterations of the base mod now mainly DayZ Epoch and it still holds up in giving satisfyng gameplay solo against all odds or teamed and rolling in a pack hunting all others down.In buying Arma2 Combined Ops package I spent some of the best value money ever, hands down. The 900 odd hours i have in game are only those recorded since steam took over server duties I probably have that much time again from pre steam days.If you don't have it get it now while it is dirt cheap still plenty of active servers out there and guess what there is zombies in the game unlike certain stand alone game I shouldn't mention.

												Holy wow do I love this game, so many shooters have no lasting effect other than ""okay so I spray painted my weapon and no one else will see it except for some tosser who ran out of ammo"", but in Dayz Mod holy cow do you feel the eyes on you when you are holding a DMR or FAL somewhere somehow someone is going to want to shoot you and take that gun. I must also itterate this is the only first person shooter that I had sights on target and I hesitated and regretted the position of hostility to someone I had not yet acknowledged or they me, basically I recoiled at the idea of shooting someone for no reason and my hands began to shake (almost like Captain Miller from saving private ryan) and took a good five minutes to calm down and reasess. Powerful interactions, or best said 40 min of boredom while hiking, 20 min of scavenging, and 5 min of pure terror as you wounder where that bullet wizzing by your head came from.			"

												This is, and will always be one of my favorite games of all time. I have so many stories of this game and I continue to make more stories every day. The best part about DayZ, is that you never know what is going to happen next, you could die, get a squad wipe, meet a friend that will be your friend for life, get backstabbed, find a DMR, find a can of beans, make a base, find a base, this game is all about what is going to happen next. This is my second favorite game of all time and it will be for life. The fan-base that this small mod has created is fantastic. There is only a few good servers left, but hell... Everyone knows everyone now. I just want to say thank you Dean Hall for making this fantatic piece, if DayZ never existed, I don't see myself playing video games. (10/10)			"

												As an avid ArmA 2 ACE player, I came to DayZ for a good zombie role play experience. I wanted to get involved in the world of the apocalypse, with some of the milsim mechanics from ArmA 2. When I went into DayZ, alot of things felt spectacular - the music, the map, the saturation, the user interface, etc. I really got a good first impressions of the game. However, my experience suffered after this point. The first problem with this mod is zombie AI pathing. Zombie AI is horrid, and zombies, to me, were more of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥rather than something to keep me on my toes and alert in the enviorment. While the sound and models were good, there was no recompense for their buggyness. After dying to some buggy zombies, because they were so rediculous, I then came across my first player. I did not want to play as a bandit, for I wanted to collaborate with people. In my first play session, I was sniped on my treck to Chernogorsk. After many playthroughs, I could not find a single friendly person. I came to the conclusion that there was barely ANY friendly people. This is because there is no incentive to help people! When you kill someone, you get their stuff, which was more than enough reason to kill someone. There are NO pros what-so-ever to being a hero, and that is a game mechanic that needs to be fixed.When I was being fired at, I was using alot of the milsim tactics that I used in ACE. However, the blood system in the game is horrid, and forces you to get headshots or use a sniper rifle on your opponent. I was in one firefight where I had an M4A1 CCO, and my opponent had an M9SD. After putting FIVE body shots into him, he shot me in the head once with his pistol, and that was the end of it. In a regular game of ArmA, my combatant would have been dead in a heartbeat. This mechanic really needs to be fixed.I really love the concept of DayZ, I really do. But the game is such a jumbled mess at the moment that needs to flesh out its mechanics and fix its formula to be a worthy mod. Zombie AI pathing needs to be fixed, hacking needs to be fixed, player interaction needs to be more dynamic, combat should be better, and camping should be less of an issuse. DayZ tries hard to be the ultimate zombie apocalypse simulator, but it really needs to work out its kinks before I get lost in the universe. If you are on the same boat with me, you may take interest in the DayZ Standalone, where hopefully, some of these issues will be adressed; and hell, that game looks promising.			"

												Well goodie you can write a review on Dayz in steam nowWell I first started playing this game back in August 2012, Entered a server my buddy sent me, spawned in to a very dark night, a flashlight and sounds of zombies around me... turned on the flashlight and I see teh zombies walking around without batting an eye to me, finally my friend showed up and we headed to a elektro (one of the main cities) and since then I fell in love with the game.Never trust people completely: A lot of the player base is a bunch of a--holes who just want to steal gear and wouldn't care to shoot you down on sight, so be very careful. that is the main rule for this gameand yes the game is a little buggy but it is a heck lot better than standalone which was a big dissappointment filled with crap juice. stopped playing a year ago, decided to install the game again but this time on steam instead of DayzCommander and wow it still getting updates, though there aren't many servers, there is still one vanilla dayz server i'm playing on which is stable and brings me the same goosebumps and joyment i've got when the game was at its prime.I recommend to get this game with a buddy or two for teh full experience.

												OK so the first month I got this game I played it for 100 hours, I had made a team of 4 (including me), we all skyped together and had a great time in the server that we were on, I remember the huge gun fights we would have with other groups. It was the best time ive had in a game since forever, this game really made me feel like I was in the zombie world from having to trust others and loot and kill just to survive. This game is a good game and will most likly be the best game to play with a team of at least 3-5, Its really fun to stalk other players in the game then snipe them when they arent looking and just the feeling of finding a DMR and going out to hunt players is just awesome. Anyway I would buy this game if you have at least a GTX 560ti and a i5 to play it because sometimes you can get down to 20 fps but the game feels smooth as 60 when its really on 30 fps, but after my 166 hours I stopped playing this game because I lost contact with my team and it was pretty boring just running around alone.

												Pros:- the mod has a whole bunch of weapons and attachments you can use- it's realistic, for instance getting shot in the leg causes it to break- it's alive, what i mean by this is that servers are still full of people even though there's dayz standalone- the mod itself is free- free russian language lessons- there is a small amount of '' little microphone squeekers'' so you don't usually have to mute anyone- there is little to none hackers thanks to the auto kick systemCons:- it's unoptimised - there is a whole bunch of people with high end rigs that can't get 30 fps and i'm not only talking about playing in big cities- it's like cs go when it comes to russians - about 60% people in all servers are russians that speak absolutely NO english (atleast from what i have seen)- the mod is extremely glitchy, it has tons of bugs and most of them are pretty f*cking annoying, for instance zombies hear you from a mile away if not cautious, walk through stairs, doors, gates and when they run after you they usually literally make f*cking circles around you, run away and then come back for you when you thought they lost you- bandits in this game are annoying - whether you're a fresh spawn or not they'll shoot you on sight without any questions asked, but the worst type of bandit is the one that says that is friendly and then shoots you in the back when you turn aroundOverall, i think the game's really great and really fun even though it has some cons here but still i definitely recommend it>9/10			"

												The darkness of the forest leaves you restless as you wait just in the treeline a few hundred meters away from the airfield. Pulling out your rifle, you switch on your nightvision, and aim down the southern side of the runway to the helicopter for the third time. Satisfied that no players have boarded the chopper, you put away your rifle and finally head down to the hangers about a hundred meters from the bird. Stopping just behind the fifth hanger from the north, you check the area once more for hostiles, only this time a bullet barely misses your head and slams harmlessly into a tree twenty away. Instinctively you back away behind the hanger and flank around to the other side, making sure no players threaten you from behind. Peeking from the front of the hanger, you identify the shooter, pull out your rifle, and take the shot. As you pull the trigger, three things happen; firstly, you killed the hostile player that shot at you moments ago, secondly, you've just alerted the player hiding inside the hanger to your presence, and lastly, you've alerted the mass of zombies patroling the airfield looking for fresh meat. Flanking back around to the back of the hanger, you then sprint for the chopper you've worked so hard to repair, only to get shot by the player inside the hanger you used as cover.Experiences like these are hard to come by. And ArmA 2 does it right.			"

												Note: Once you load the mod it doesn't really count the hours but I have over 1000+ hours on DayZ including all different mods like Overwatch, Epoch, Overpoch, Origins, Vanilla, that weird ww2 dayz, and alot of other modsDayZ, this game is just great. You have a awesome survival simulator with zombies and you can also play it with your friends to survive the apocalypse. There are also other mods that can extend the experience even more if you dont like JUST surviving. Personally, Vanilla DayZ is my favorite because to me its scary compared to other mods.If you want to survive, loot, and thrive with your friends all while being worried about zombies and other players who may or may not try to kill you, play Vanilla.If you dont like zombies and you just wanna PVP, base build, and trade, go with epoch/overwatch. These 2 mods or both of them combined (Overpoch) change the experience by adding in traders and base building.Also, if your new to DayZ you should visit FrankieOnPCin1080p and view his series. He teaches you to play the game all while having a cinematic experience. Here's his first video.

												An amazing game, my time does now matter I have spent count less amount of hours on the mod. It's proberly the best game i've ever played, by you're self its no fun but when you're with a clan its a whole different ball park. Imgiane rolling in one of the main towns in a humvee with a .50 cal while a Blackhawk is giving you covering fire while you try to dodge the bulletes of an opposing clan, or when you're stalking other players at night armed with a DMR, a ghillie and a pair of Night Vision Goggles which leads up to a ten kill streak and ending in a giant fire fight. Then when thats all over and you start runing back to base you and your whole squad is killed by a sniper team and you have to restart all over and you know why you restart all over? Because you had a blast doing the same to other players, this game is not for people who do not like taking their time or those who like fast action 24/7 and depending on what you play Ex. Epoch,Overwatch Etc. You have to build a base while doing all the above but its worth it! You will meet amazing people and have fun at it but you WILL rage quit and you WILL lose evrything at one point in time, but over all I'd say its worth it.			"

												Definetly one of my favorite post apocalyptic games, and that means something because thats my favorite game genre :Dbut it does lack some crucial elements that do stand out when you play. Very fun yet very buggy but it doesnt comepletly ruin the game. If you like zombie survival games then this is striaght up your alley! It has a ton of scavenging and murdering and all those goodies! I do reccomend this if you like zombie games but if you're just looking for post apocalyptic games then I would recommend Arma 2's Wasteland survival. It is basicaly DayZ without zombies or random drops. Anyways it is truly a great game without all the bugs. I would get it if you like zombie games but if you don't then I wouldn't think this is for you.Things that realy stood out:Amount of bugs: 6/10Design: 8/10Lasting appeal: 7/10OVERALL: a fair 7.5/10			"

It's a challenge to survive in this game and the many sub-mods you can get for this game add even more to the replay value. The game does give a bit of rage and it does get SUPER boring when you have nobody to play the game and enjoy it with. The walking is a bit long but hey this game's alright.			"

												The DayZ Mod is a masterpiece in my opinion, And I dont understand the people that say they dont play it because its broken. Its really not, But thats their opinion and they are probably hipsters of videogames also. This game has evolved from a very basic survival game to a very complex web of mods and different ways to play. The modding community have done alot to DayZ that will probably make it forever better then the Standalone. Unless the Standalone is equally or better to make mods for.			"

												Arma 2 dayz is a very good game with loads to explore and do! The basics are get friends, Stay away from the hordes and keep away from anyone hostile! This is a very fun game but has a few learning curves but apart from that this game is a very solid game with stunning graphics! and lots of land to explore! There is a few severs still running on the game but not as many as there used to  due to the release of Arma 3 dayz mod and the Dayz Standalone, but there is still a good amount of players to interact with and to team up with, but just remember be careful who you trust! Overall: This game is very good and as shown by the famous youtuber Frankieonpcin1080p, I give this game a 8.5/10 would recommend anyone playing this when you get the chance as it's still a great game no matter what! :)			"

												Well besides the constant frame drop and the occasional DDOS attacks, DayZ Seems to be a game that I would recommend to anybody who has a grand computer. Now you dont even need a grand computer to play this game either. Trust me I have logged over 800 hours on this game and every single second I play I am getting below 20 frames, but when I zoom in on the long range of my  Mosin the frames just wipe away and its aftermath is beatiful. I recommend this game for all jump scare, thrill seeking, heart stoping, bunny bashing, zombie killing, fps, and third person gamer out there.10/10 "

												After purchasing Arma CO for a discounted bundle I managed to install this game. Guys if you get installation errors it's most likely the dayz mod you installed from steam. Simply redownload it and it should work fine now. That's what I did when Arma says Missing content. Anyways when you play the game BE SURE to play in a morning server because the worst mistake I did was to play in a server in night time which I got instantly killed over. The game is good though and lots of people to trust/not trust but I never encountered one due to my short gameplay.			"

												MANY long and fun hours to be had, for those of you that arent aware you can play your more advanced DayZ and im not talking just your Vanilla basic DayZ mod version. Simply Install DayZ Launcher and from there you are able to experience it from a whole different level, there are many great servers but sadly not as much as there once use to be. But the remaining servers are very fun and still very populatedThrough the DayZ Launcher you will find you will be able to install different mods and maps for DayZ which all improve the gameplay for those who are playing, for example DayZ Epoch mod a much more improved version and there are many othersNow as for this launcher one can easily find and download from the website on the web. (Note There once use to be other launchers such as this.. say for example DayZ Commander which no longer works, I believe the only working launcher for Arma 2 is DAYZ Launcher.[Links for the launchers]1.) https://dayzlauncher.com   (By far the easiest launcher)2.) http://customcombatgaming.com (Appears to only support ARMA 3 now)3.) Just so you all are aware do not use this launcher as it no longer works -> http://www.dayzcommander.com/Also be aware DayZ isnt just for Arma 2 alone, there are some incredible and hugely populated servers for ARMA 3 ALSOA GREAT AND POPULAR YOUTUBER WHO I REALLY APPRECIATE FOR THE GREAT DEAL OF QUALITY IN ALL HIS VIDEOS IS FRANKIE ON PC !!

												You may need a good computer to run this on high graphics for this game. But even when the game is on medium graphics it looks fine. Also away from the graphics, overall it's a good mod/game. Basiclly you playing a apocalypse world of zombies and other people trying to survive, so while you play the game zombies is the not the only thing you need to worry about. Also you need to worry about bandits trying to kill you. (Other players) But also there's good people you can team up with and dominate the map in a helicopter full of people to a bus full of people. So there's lots of things you can do. So I recommend this game although you will need Arma II and Arma II Operation Arrowhead to get Dayz the mod it's fine just get it when it's on sale. Anyway I rate this game a 9.0 out of 10. "

												DayZ is really good game!!! Best way to spend your time with friends. You see that i have only a couple of hours playing DayZ, thats because i play it using DayZ commander, I played it more than 1000 hours! Youll never get bored of it! Some recommendations:1. Be patient (wait for zombies to go away and than go), do not attack zombies whith firearms (other will hear) use hachet or crowbar to attack them.2. Try to find any type of vehicle.3. Do not run in cities or villages.4. Always free space for food and water.5. Whatch out - there are many snipers6. DO NOT TRUST ANYONE - if someone says he or she is friendly you'll probably get killed.7. KILL EVERYONE THAT YOU SEE, OR RUN IF HE HAS A WEAPON.8. ALWAYS LEAVE ONE BULLET IN MAGS, THAN DISCONECT TO LOBBY AND PRESS OK TO COME IN GAME AGAIN, your mag will be full9. Spend some hours in Arma 2 to learn to gear			"

												Overall a unique great sandbox FPS with a lot of potential.Positives:Sandbox, gathering , building, PVP, it has it allNegatives:The game lacks optimisation, hitboxes & otehr aspects are affected,Character animation is slow & sketchy, the the inventory & picking upitems is cumbersome, loading into servers is slow & can be troublesome.If you look past these issues the positives are still enough to warrant playingas the games fun with friends especially, there are a wide variety of serversrunning different mods/featurees to suit everyone.This mod runs far better on Arma 3 & is a lot more optimised & less issues,but the Arma 2 features/mods/servers tend to be prefered by many ppl still.There are only few games like this & they are not as good, even the standaloneisnt as good (yet) & is taking far to long, i've been playing this game for years& its one you always come back too if you game hop.

												DayZ Mod is a realistic Zombie first and third person shooter survival game. You spawn on the coast and must survive the apocalypse. I think that this game was very well designed and is very fun to play. The map, Chernarus, is enormous so it does take a little while to get from one side of the map to the other on foot. This game is not meant for people looking for games whith a lot of action, I believe that this game is meant for people who have more than an hour to take up, and people who like realistic survivalist games. I give this game a 9/10 and recommend it for people who wouldnt mind dying and losing all of their progress.			"

												On one hand, DayZ is a military simulator, with all the makings of one: Bullet drop, the constant need for camouflage, and a mind-boggling ammunition system that, while being fair, forces memorization, as each weapon has its own independent ammunition. Sorry, but no shared ammo between multiple assault rifles. That M4 and AK-74 each need their own magazines. On the other hand, DayZ is also a game of survival in a brutal apocalyptic world. Not for a single second will this game hold your hand. You'll be required to cross large stretches of zombie-infested terrain to find food, water, and weapons to survive. It could be argued that your fellow survivors are just as dangerous as the infected. The big question that will ultimately shape your experience in this game is whether or not you will make an attempt to reach out and help your fellow player in his or her mission to survive.As you play, you will generally find that it seems as if the whole game is against you, and is actively attempting to either starve, shoot, or slash you to death. You wouldn't be wrong. Supplies are scarce, and zombies are common. Depending on your server population (and the nature of its community), you may also have anything from massive friendly settlements to small, trigger-happy groups of survivors attempting to forge their own way in the world. The farther you move from urban environments, the harder it will become to find things like weapons, ammunition and medical supplies. This will, eventually, force you into a situation where heading into a city is your only option. This by itself is not necessarily a bad thing: Guns, first-aid supplies and even army uniforms are all rather common in these areas. The only thing to be wary of is the watchful eye of a potential sniper.Your enjoyment of this game will stem only from your eagerness for realism and/or your hunger for a challenge. Play this game at your own risk, for it will be a long, difficult journey. But, if you are successful, you will have accumulated knowledge and power, the likes of which few survivors have ever seen.			"

It is also quite difficult to run the game so if you get 30 fps or more you have godly fps for armaThis game is truly amazing for the price you can get it at if theres a sale on.

												Can't find any servers, they always say my version or whatever is outdated.. When its not.When I find servers, there are either no vehicles, no english people, no friendlys, too many zombies...ALWAYS MODIFIED SERVERSNO REGULAR SERVERSWHERE THERE ARE DECENT AMOUTN OF LOOT, ZOMBIES, VEHICLES, AND ACTUAL FRIENDLY PLAYERS!If you can find a friendly player, then trust him with your life. Team with him, and watch eachothers backs, because the world of DayZ is incredibly dangerous. You could stumble into a bandit camp, and be shot to death. Walk through a town, and be sniped. Lose enough blood? No problem, you'll only become unconcious... But, the major problem with becoming unconcious, is, if a lone player (or zombie) stumbles across you... you're dead meat. That zombie will rip into your flesh and kill you. However, if a FRIENDLY lone player finds you, they hopefully will heal you and stuff. Because heres how heroes work: Find injured player > heal him > suffer consequences if he is hostile Anyway, its fun, and a great experience if you can find a good server.			"

												Because I use the dayz commander the time played does not match how much time I've actually played. I've put in a good 100+ hours. This mod has a very harsh and steep learning curve if you come from other, more conventional zombie games. It is rewarding when you learn how to play.Pros :- Zombie Simulator- Large map that supports quite a few players- Multiple different game types- Multiple different game maps, I think they are borrowed from Arma 2, but I don't know because I don't really play core Arma.Cons:- STEEP learning curve- Very frustrating when you die and loose all of your loot- Buggy- Most servers are very PvP oriented to the point that there is really no teamwork.

												This is better than the standalone, by a mile. If you want proof, just go watch gameplay of first the Standalone and then the mod. Way more custom stuff to do, and maybe cheaper depending on your exhange rate and when ARMA 2 is on sale.Don't ever invest in Early Access, unless it's overwhelmingly positive, because it'll never turn out well. Unless you convert the entire engine like Rust and start again from square 1.DayZ standalone sucks, Arma 2: DayZ is miles better.			"

												Important Notice:In order to play DayZ Mod it is essential to use a free launcher utility which will download and update custom mods, maps, and weapons required to play on most servers. Launchers will also allow you to search for the type of server you want to play on as many different play styles and maps are available. Just launching this basic DayZ Mod download here on Steam will not be enough to connect to the vast majority of servers. So the first thing you should do after installing Arma 2 is download a launcher. Some of the most popular DayZ launchers are:http://dayzlauncher.com http://dayzmodlauncher.comhttp://dayzcommander.comhttp://withsix.com (also supports hundreds of other mods for ARMA 2)I've been playing PC games since the PC was invented, and DayZ Mod is one of the most interesting, exciting and immersive games I've ever played. It's basically a multiplayer apocalyptic virtual world or sandbox without any quests or storyline unless created by the players themselves. You go where you want and do as you want. You determine everything that happens except for the response from other players. You can be a bandit or hero engaging in constant gun battles in the busier towns or you can run off into the wilderness and build yourself a cabin in the middle of nowhere and hunt to survive. There are very few limits on what you can do.I recommend DayZ Mod over DayZ Standalone for several reasons. One of the coolest things about the Mod is that because it is not centrally controlled and developed by a single team it offers many different types of games, maps, and improvements for free from hundreds of different players and community developers and continues to evolve in many alternative directions. There are Hunger Games type mods to play like Battle Royal where it's everyone for themselves and you fight to be the last one standing, militarized mods like Overwatch full of heavy military weapons, aircraft and tanks, crafting and base building type mods like Epoch and Origins that allow you to more permanently carve out your own piece of the world and make it your home, survival type mods like vanilla DayZ, and even alien type mods like Invasion. With the Mod there are so many different options and environments available for play that you're bound to find a server that suits you and if you don't you can even set up your own server and customize it just the way you like. That will never happen with the Standalone.The Mod is also much cheaper as Arma 2 Combined Operations and Arma X Anniversary keys can be bought for about $5 and $8 each, just search Google. Not only do you pay less and get dozens of different games and options for play, but you also get the original Arma 2 combat simulator games too, which are not too bad themselves.Overall, DayZ Mod is a must have if you enjoy PC gaming. Many games are trying to imitate it now, but nothing really compares so far, and it will probably remain that way simply because free DayZ mods are community developed by those purely passionate about making cool mods and games while everything else is being developed primarily for profit			"

												The popularity of DayZ is more than deserved. It's something different than the rest of multiplayer games for how to interact with the others players. If played in the proper way, you don't shoot on sight others players but ponder the situation. You do moral choices and careful examination of their own behaviour when you meet another player. Can you trust them? Are they a threat? Is it safer to ignore them? Try to coop? This is something that can suddenly give you emotions during the game. Just a little example. One of the first players I spotted was a bandit, he didn't spot me but that was enough to scare me and fear for my life. I rushed immediately into my vehicle and stumbled against an obstacle after some meters as I was very inexpert with the roads and all. Then I was almost dead and I tried to ask help just to that bandit that was around...It's an alpha, has bugs, glitches, needs some balancing to reduce the kill on sights issue probability... but I had a lot of fun with this game so far.

												Probably my favorite game hands down. Arma 2: DayZ Mod offers players with it's unique zombie survival game, coupled with Arma 2 and Arma 2 OA's battle-ready engine. The game never gets boring as it has files upon files of mods you can add to the game - AND PLAY MULTIPLAYER WITH THEM. It is extremely fun to play, you feel like you are an actual post apocalyptic survivor, and it is very pretty if your computer can handle it.10/10I'm lovin' it.			"

												I recommend this game because it is one of my personal favorite survival games.  It most definitely demonstrates what surviving against other people and zombies in a huge open world map would be like.One of the things that really stuck out to me is the fact that you get GREAT FPS, almost no lag whatsoever.  I own DayZ Standalone as well as this, and comparing the two, I've found that the Mod runs so much smoother.  I don't have the best computer, but that just proves my point even more since my computer can still handle the Mod.  And I'm not just saying I get no lag on the lowest settings, I can run the game on the highest video settings possible and it still runs as if I was playing Minecraft on the lowest settings, now that's damn good.The gameplay is extremely good for being a mod.  The mod proposes fair fights for survival against other players, as well as surviving against the environment despite other people arguing against this just because they died too many times.  I enjoy every minute of the game, even when I die.  To me dying in this game just means a brand new start and a chance to get even better gear.  You definitely learn what to do and what not to do.  The game has concequences for your actions as if you were really in a zombie apocalypse, and that just adds to the fact that the game is almost as realistic as you can get.My favorite thing on this game is the size of the map.  It's just huge.  Plain and simple.  You never run out of places to go and boredom is hard to achieve.  The size of cities/towns are acceptable, and the distance between them proposes that ""journey"" aspect that we all love about free roam.  Lastly, the game proposes a challenge.  Zombies are a ♥♥♥♥♥ in the beginning, but once you get weapons and such, you have bigger problems to prepare for.  Sickness, starvation, dehydration and other people.  You always have something to worry about, and that just makes the definition of survival even more present in this game.  It is survival of the fittest, and if you're not good enough, you WILL die.  That just means you have to adapt and learn to become the character you're playing as.Of course I do have a few things that I dislike that I feel like I should share with readers.-The inventory system isn't that great, It's really complicated.  I had a very hard time getting used to it, but after a while I had it down.-Zombie AI blows, it's very hard to melee or shoot a zombie if you're not good at shooting targets that jerk back and forth or do unexpected things such as run away.-The amount of controls you have to learn and master is insane.  But once again, once you learn, you don't forget.-There are so many buildings that you wish you could go into, but you can't.  Cities are made up of a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of houses, and other structures but a good number of them are just decoration unfortunately.  This was quite annoying to me.-If you are just starting out, it is a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to try outrunning zombies if you don't have a weapon of some sort.  These cons are most definitely outweighed by the pros.  Watching a tutorial will help with some of these such as the control and inventory problems as well as finding ways to get past zeds when you're a fresh spawn.In conclusion, I reccomend this game for people who love a good free roam apocalyptic PVP survival game with a good challenge.  BUY IT! it's worth it!			"

												Although this game is termed as a simulation, aspects of the game can be more realistic in terms of its genre. The game, despite the fact that Standalone has come out, is very big and you should have no trouble finding a server. However, the installation is a lengthy process since you must download ARMA 2 and ARMA 2: Operation Arrowhead.  I and so do others highly recommend the installation of DayZ Commander. This program updates it, and can find the best servers. Although, most servers requires 1.6.2v and DayZ Commander only has the power to give you from 1.7.2-1.8.I'd give it an 8/10.			"

This game is very challneging otherwise and strangers can't be trusted. 8/10 for me and the final build hasn't even released yet.			"

												DayZ, Where to start...DayZ is a Multiplayer Zombie Survival mod for the military simulator ARMA 2, It features zombies, zombies, and more ♥♥♥♥ing zombies. When you're caught up in a firefight between some ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hacker who can't die, or you're wrapping a bandage around your neck when it's spurting blood due to your severe hemophilia the game would seriously be better without zombies. The zombies aren't like regular zombies, no! DayZ zombies love to rap, they can rap with you from ten meters away, and even tear open your flesh and snap your bones in a single rap! Your character in DayZ is a lethargic obese superhero, He decides to take a nap whem the zombies are rapping with him! (How rude) When he awakes though, he OD's on morphine and painkillers and he's back in tip top shape, broke bones regrow! Watch yourself though, if you dare to take more than a 2 feet drop, that's you dead! Yes, really! That's how obese your character is! Also, doorways are a problem sometimes and don't eve try and go near another player indoors, you'll teleport through the wall, dead!Another great part about DayZ is how it has a mind of its own! Game dosen't like you running near the ocean? It'll throw you into the air! Game dosen't like you driving a quadbike? It'll throw you into the air! Game dosen't like you wearing flaming backpacks? It'll spawn you miles into the ocean to extinguish the flames! Game dosen't like you for whatever ♥♥♥♥ing reason, IT ♥♥♥♥ING KILLS YOU!Hackers are another thing, impossible to kill, ruining every server you're on, hours of ♥♥♥♥ing work, GONE!♥♥♥♥ DAYZ, ♥♥♥♥ IT, ITS A ♥♥♥♥ING AWFULL MOD, ITS FULL OF ♥♥♥♥ING GLITCHES, HACKERS AND GLITCHING HACKERS♥♥♥♥			"

												This game was the greatest zombie survival i've ever played. Basically Arma II w/ zombies and other stuff. 30/10 recommended. Also has decent graphics, Vehicles, running into a bunch of bandits, teaming up to survive and what not. You also walk around like ALOT until you get a vehicle. The only bad thing about the game is that you need a decent server, that saves your progress and actually WORKS. This is a huge problem. Finding servers are very, very hard. Most of them are HAAAx'd. DayZ commander solves that issue, but it still hard to find a server but way easier and more managable. Now the DayZ Standalone is released is comes back more awesome. Must play.			"

												It took me a while to get into this game/mod. But after I got a couple of mates together I was soon finding myself drawn back into it time and time again.Despite the bugs, which can be forgiven because of the mod's Alpha status, this game provides an extremely immersive experience (for lack of a better term). With no missions or story presented to the player, it's up to yourself to decide your goals alongside the basic premise of simply surviving. Perhaps that's not to everyone's taste, but the stories I've been able to tell because of both successful and failed expeditions are amazing. Many a tense moment has been spent risking everything to try and get some powerful weapons or because of a frantic dash for medical supplies while close to death.A steep difficulty curve and frustrating inventory system are totally worth pushing through for some of the most exciting moments I've had playing a game with friends.

												Free Mod for ARMA 2.  Requires ARMA 2 and ARMA 2 Arrowhead to play.  Install DayZ Commander or Play withsix to install mod updates, plus other DayZ mod variants.  I am currently playing Dayz Epoch which includes base building and vehicle ownership.  Closest thing to a Massively Multiplayer Online First Person Shooter (MMOFPS) I have ever played.  Servers usually run 30-60 players.  You can run around ganking people or quietly build your base.  Very addictive.			"

												What a nice mod! I've played many zombo games before but this one is just great. The feeling of harsh survival  is omnipresent,    threats are everywhere (either Zeds or mostly other players), a very nice detailled world filled with point of interests, quite simple UI that won't hide your field of view, option to play in third or first person when traveling or in combat and of course lots of looting to be done. Add to that the concept of perma-death a.k.a. when-you-die-you-gotta-start-over-for-real, you really have to evaluate the risks you are taking in-game. Be a Survivor, a Heroe or an infamous Bandit, the choice is yours but we all start as a ""Bambie"". Dayz mod is an impressive game and totally one to be tried. Worth your time.  Thanks to Frankie and Rhino for making me discover this great game, if in doubt about playing the game, go see their movies on youtube,			"

												DayZ has destroyed my love for Dead Island, L4D, zombie games in general and my will to study. ""Killing another player in this game is incomparable to any other game. The feeling that your actions are greatly impacting another player is thrilling, regardless of if it's positive or negative. There is no risk to death in games like CoD. You lose points. In DayZ, you lose EVERYTHING. Some people like that high octane rush.I don't kill players, and I'd hate it if people weren't bandits.""The best game evaar! I have never invested so much time and effort into a game up to DayZ. Poised and ready to unleash my self on the Standalone!			"

												This game was the greatest zombie survival i've ever played. Basically Arma II w/ zombies and other stuff. 30/10 recommended. Also has decent graphics, Vehicles, running into a bunch of bandits, teaming up to survive and what not. You also walk around like ALOT until you get a vehicle. The only bad thing about the game is that you need a decent server, that saves your progress and actually WORKS. This is a huge problem. Finding servers are very, very hard. Most of them are HAAAx'd. DayZ commander solves that issue, but it still hard to find a server but way easier and more managable. Now the DayZ Standalone is released is comes back more awesome. Must play.			"

												Это самая лучшая модификация для игры, я бы даже назвал ее отдельной игрой, но не назову, т.к. скоро выйдет отдельная игра. Ради этого мода стоит потратить 700 рублей! Этот мод, ну оооочень реалестичен, атмосфера как в реале, время идет точно как в реале, час здесь, час в реальной жизни. Будет только одно не приятно : если вы найдете ""Урал"", и вам придется ехать через Старый Собор))) Покупайте ARMA 2, и вы не пожалеете если установите этот мод!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

So exciting! My wife got shot over 40 times by men that had a helicopter! they took us into the helicopter, saying were we hostage! Me and my son we so excited that we got a free island tour in a helicopter, the men then took us to a mountain and left us there while talking our maps,food,water, and supplies! :D The natives are a little fiesty but its so fun! we even met a person who was shooting all the 'natives'! My son got his arm torn off by one of them! Our hotel was in Elektro, and it was FREE! There was nobody at the front door nor the check-in table! We also took more pictures at Balota, and Berizno! Its the most amazing vacation you will ever have with the family!I rate this a 10/10!			"

(okay i admit i got banned for cheating but im clean now)this is a really good gaem to play because it was the start of all the other ones.  yeah standalone/rust/the forest/reign of kings/ark/whatever other game there is or will be...it all started here.most games you dont really care if you die...well in this game you spend hours and hours looting...you sure will be angry/sad if you die.  so it makes the game a lot more fun.standalone even made this even better with handcuffs and drinking disinfectant...you knock someone out or maybe make someone surrender...then you handcuff them.  and you take all their stuff and they beg you ""no please dont kill me!!  take everything i have but let me live!!!  please!!!"" and theyre begging and crying and you can make them drink disinfectant or shoot them or let them go...its the choice that makes it fun...hahaso yeah i would recommend it			"

												After the hundreds of hours spent playing this game, I can say with full confidence that it is the closest to perfect zombie survival game out there. I've tried others, but the sheer scale of the game is jaw-dropping, and the realism is incredible. However, the bugs, glitches, desync and countless amount of other problems are a drawback, but aren't enough to throw me off. A solid 8/10, but would be much more if not for the problems encountered by most players. I just hope the standalone can impress in the later stages of its development, as it is currently an awful piece of trash, but has lots of potential.			"

												Short version: I started playing this game without having tried Arma II yet. I had no idea what I was doing, got shot at in the first few seconds and then got mauled by a zombie. 10/10Second playthrough, long version. Started off way to the southeast of the map (map takes you like well over a couple hours to cross by the way, it's pretty huge), killed a dozen zombies with a machete and nearly died trying to get into a building. Made my way 3 kilometers north to a major town while being unable to find a single scrap of food and only getting empty water bottles. Killed another dozen on my way sneaking in, filled up my water bottles and had a whole minute to drink before I got swarmed. Racked my way up to ~50 kills while barely conscious before I backed up onto a hospital roof, with the hospital now surrounded by zombies. Ate the food and water I'd managed to scrounge up, slipped down the rear ladder that only had a few zombies by it. Quietly chopped them up and slipped in, to find no medical supplies. Headed north to a military airfield, hoping it had a medical bay. On my way, found a jeep loaded with a rifle and some ammo, stole it and kept heading north. Got to the airfield, picked up an M16 but couldn't get any medical supplies. Headed off to the woods and logged off.Logged back in, drove back to the airfield and got shot by a sniper. Spawned a while away, found a second (glitched) copy of my jeep that someone had taken and crashed to the side of the road, probably dying inside it. Got in, headed back to the airfield, shot the bandit with a full mag from my glock before coming up behind him and inserting a machete into his rectal area. Got my gear back, the medical supplies I no longer needed, a new giant backpack, and a choice of the items from the 4 other dead bodies he'd killed that were laying around. Shanked some more zombies, headed in the woods with a fully loaded military jeep and an assault rifle fitted with a grenade launcher. Logged off, looking forward to blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up tomororw. 10/10			"

												DayZ Mod is a beautiful experience. This is the mod that started the early-access survival game genre. You can expect the same gameplay and bugs that were present when the game came out. I really enjoy Arma 2 and its open world. The loot and zombies are secondary to the encounters and pvp you will encounter on this adventure. I would recommend playing on a vanilla server such as Europa and US434.			"

Also be prepared to trek the whole map (which is 100km2 ) to maximise how well you do in game. You do have to be prepared to gather alot of 'loot' and prepare to loose it in a second. The mentality of the players for the game has changed since it's growing popularity and now alot of players will shoot of sight. You might get lucky and get the one friendly guy but that's one in a million.A couple things to note before getting the mod:1. DayZ Standalone Alpha(er) is soon to be released so If you have patience, maybe waiting for the SA is a good idea2. The game is not well optimized with alot of players complaining about FPS. In the open fields you will reach your maximun FPS but towns and build up areas will effect your FPS.3. If you aren't into games which involve talking to people, just be warned that comunication with others players will slow with swapping between different chat channels, talking and moving is slightly complicated.There are alot of other factors that go with the mod like using external programs to search through servers and error problems but google is your friend and you can easily find a fix.

												My First day in DayZ!------------------------So these guys lived at the airfield, me being hostile and with a glock and a machete, wanted to say hi. Befor i did that i noticed that they were 7 had a chopper, 2 humvees, and 2 red offroaders and also alot of big guns. They were killing some guys, when i decided to kill 2 of them, which i did :D ( i killed 2 guys with a glock and 1 had an AK-47, and the other an Lee Enfield) after looting them i noticed there was another guy like 5 metrs behind me telling me to put down my guns. That scared the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me so i got on my bike whiche was next to me and started to pedal away. I was so lucky that, that guy didnt know how to shoot, but almost killed me, i had 2000 blood left (max is 12000), and a broken leg. i drow my bike in too the woods, patched up and noticed that there was a heli above me and 2 humvees behind me, so i ran farther, i shot the heli, so it would fly away, so it did. But then i remembered the humvees. I ran into the nearest city and hid in a barn, i thought that i lost then, but they knew that i was some where close. i saw 4 of them looking for me and i managed to kille 2 of them and disconnect. the i got on my bike and ran again, till the got bored of chasing me...-------------------------------------------16/10 - would raid with a glock again :D-------------------------------------------------If you want to find out how to play and install dayz mod properly, contact me,plz, il be happy to help you, it wont take much time, depends on your internet connection :)			"

												Better than the standalone from what I heard, the DayZ mod is an extremely well done Arma 2 Combined Operations mod. With the great gameplay and tons of heated moments this game is great for anybody that is into survival and action games. There are some downsides though, for one the steam download is out of date, so you need to use a 3rd party software like DayZ Commander to properly lauch the game you also need a decent computer to run the game efficiently, but if you are really persistant you shouldn't have a problem running it at 30fps on lowest settings using intel integrated graphics 4000, but overal this game is great and much much better than anything else like it. Buy the games and get this mod!			"

												I liked the Idea of the Mod but I'm just going to pick on Gameplay. Imagine you spend 1.5hrs trying to find a gun and you get killed by a zombie or player who you assumed was friendly. The devs have to cut back on zombies and disable their run features, they should only crawl or walk slow. I get it's a SHTF situation but you would survive if you were in a group. Fortunatly for me I often get chased for 10-20 km's by zombies and I do marathons. I would reccomend the Mod, but I would reccomend to balance Zombies, Weapons, Players, Resources, Gameplay			"

												This game is awsome, the mods that came after dayz mod were just so cool. Epoch and all those. I still prefer when there were more Z even if its more laggy!It was all about the Z, it was hard to survive, so getting to hero or bandit was just so freak and rewardful!Install both ARMA II thingy from steam, and pop the commander!Get dayz commander, find the most popular mod for arma II and there you go!Dont waste time on steam with DAYZWithout the Z, it's not the same.But i look foward to play with friends!

I hear people walking towards me. ""Take the dog out!"" I hear. My friend told me to say I'm friendly. ""I'm Friendly"" I shout. I feel what felt like a punch to my stomach. The man left. I look at the bottom right of my stomach. I'm starving. I can't get to the fridge... It's to far away. I'm also thirsty but when am I not? I swear everything is blurring out... This game is feeling too real. I went down the stairs to see 3 guys, a man who looked old, a young man, and a baby. ""Go upstairs conor"" How did he know my name?

												Although far superior, and actually finished, than the StandAlone version, the DayZ mod seems to be dying and windling away as more players go towards the use of mods as well as towards StandAlone to improve the gaming quality. Of course, the best way to enhance your DayZ Mod experience is to use DayZ Commander, which will warrant the use of mods to be downloaded- and as a result opening up a vast array of servers to play on. That is provided you have Combined Operations installed (Operation Arrowhead, and all the other DLC's for Arma 2).It's the forerunner to StandAlone, the best and finalised version of DayZ, but with the basic and original implementations that the DayZ SA developers want to integrate to the SA game. Overall, alright for a laugh and its free- get a taste for DayZ before you get the Standalone. But you might end up finding some problems along the way.			"

												welcome to dayz where you might be able to play with friends and there might be plenty of servers to join (if you buy all the addon packs of arma 2).not a good mod at all cant connect to any good servers and any servers you do join you just become a crow or spawn in a base full of hackers and die.dayz standalone is looking good though.just dont get buy arma 2 for dayz mod it wont work.

												Quick Note: I have many more hours in game, however since I started using DayZ Commander  to play DayZ Epoch Servers, it doesn't continue listing.In DayZ, death is inevitable... You'll start of in a massive setting you know nothing about, with no clue where to go or what to do. You'll likely try to be quick on your feet to find some useful stuff to survive, which will more then likely get you killed, and yet, you'll want to try again. Slowly you'll learn it's better to sneak around in the shadows and crawl for hundreds of feet on your belly simply to find some Frank n Beans, then before long you'll be set with supplies, proud of your accomplishments, possibly even finding a nice ride to store your loot and get around safetly until.... An unnoticed survivor in the distance decides to take your head off with his DMR. This game can be brutaly hard in the wrong situations, but very fun and fulfilling in the right ones, just remember the zeds are plenty, and trust no one because most these survivors would kill their own mother for a can of Pepsi.I'd suggest anyone who wishes to play this should get DayZ Commander and update the mod to better versions with more functionality providing more immersion. As stated above, I now play DayZ Epoch, which adds a great deal to the game. I myself have chosen to go onto PvE servers where players team up to survive and take on the Zeds and AI Bandits and love it. This mod will surely give me thousands of hours of gameplay, and not very many games can pull that off for me. I'm way behind everyone else getting into this DayZ craze, I avoided it for a long time because despite all the die hard fans, a lot complained about bugs and issues, but I myself have run into very few bugs (Most of which were on the basic version installed here on Steam) and none of them were game breaking. If you see ArmA2 Combined Ops on sale, buy it.			"

												One of the saddest IPs ever. I played this game tons back in '12 & '13. It was sketchy back then (ran my own server), but it's just full on jankie now. I attempted to get a new server going (Apr '17), and it was even worse in terms of getting it working than it was a few years back. What a great idea - an official sandbox zombie survival game. And it is it's worst enemy. It should be at least approachable by now, but alas, its stagnant development & support is definitely showing its effects. Do not buy the standalone in hopes all issues have been ironed out - it's EVEN WORSE, and the cover charge of $35 is laughable! Avoid this abandaned IP, no matter how much you're tempted to kill zeds with friends; try a copycat title - they are worth more than this.			"

-Disclosure (I only bought this during Christmas, therefore being quite a late DayZ Player.)For a game that has been abandoned by it's developers due to Standalone and Arma 3, I still believe that this game has a good vibe to it. Survival aspects are cool, however my main issues are as of follows;Issues~1. Glitches, granted it's a Mod however, I'm sure if the developers gave the game a few more months to perhaps stabalize it, and maybe code it better? Then maybe it will have an affect on the communities attitude towards the game and perhaps wouldn't have them quitting due to their hard work lost by a zombie that glitched through a wall and knocked them off the edge of a tower.2. Small Player Base, which creates a dead aspect towards Multiplayer. The big servers are your only hope, and even then it has about 40+ players sometimes, and in my opinion it's difficult to find loot on such populated servers meaning your experience isn't as spectacular as you would've seen from perhaps a Youtubers or Streamers POV.In conclusion, I do not recommend DayZ, just because the player base is slowly decreasing, although, my opinion may change in the future. Even though the game is dying, I am not prepared to declare it a bad game. So for the communities experience, I would suggest not buying the Combined Operations Pack which allows you to install DayZ Mod for full price which in GBP is £16.99, however, on sale I have seen it being reduced to £3.49. So perhaps on sale, sure buy it for the sake of it being quite a big PC Game. Rating on gameplay: 5/10 "

												If you are wanting a short review before my rant then i will simply say:Good amounts of content but a frustrating and glitchy pile of junk.Dayz may be a popular mod for arma2 but besides the shear amount of content to choose from you would not know it. Most games with cult followings have fan made patches or fixes to polish out the rough edges and make the game more enjoyable.This is not the case with the dayz mod. The game feels and looks terrible it plays even worse.Animations are poor as are the response times when you press a command key.Example you are in a house when a zombie runs inside and approaches you,you hit a key to draw a weapon only to have it take about 10 seconds all the while the zombie is chomping on your neck.Glitches that should have been fixed by somebody or anybody ruin the immersion and make even simple tasks a nightmare. There is no excuse for a game having been out this long to posses such a myriad of faults and glitches.This is assuming you can even get the game to run for more than 30 minutes before it drops you for no apparent reason. can say with certainty that i have spent more time Patching,Fixing ,Updating and doing general maintenance and troubleshooting problems than actually playing the game.How this mod is so popular i will never know it is a over-complicated pile of junk.

												I came from like 500 hours in DayZ mod before Dayz for Steam, and i can say that this is one of the best game i ever played. It's not for people who thinks that this is a easy game, like Call of Duty, but it's for people who want more realism in a game.I played in Chernarus, in Fallujha (best map i think, you need to prove it), Chernarus Epoch, Panthera, Utes and much more. I never, and i said never, get bored.Lots of weapons, awesome graphic engine, pvp, driving and stuff, farming, zombies everywhere, looting... Awesome!10/10 Just a tip: for everyone who want to start to play Dayz, you should play a bit of singleplayer or armory in ArmaII, just for understand the basic of this game.			"

												Amazing Mod it is so worth it if you can forgive the the bugs and glitches due to it being a mod its an amazing game/mod their are many different types of add on mods that come with the game that make it even more incredible. If you are to get it i reccomend you get Dayz Commander since its easier to find servers and download other mods. If you like zombie survival games this is the best one around. 9/10 highly reccomend			"

												To be honest, I initially thought ""Not another zombie survival game"" until I played it. Three sleepless nights later, I have finally realized that I'm hooked. Never before have I seen a game of this caliber. REHAB may be needed to get me off this game.			"

												If you're contemplaiting grabbing the games needed to play this, I will tell you two things:1) Get ready for a bit of frustration (though it is worth it in the end)2) Keep an eye out for them to be on sale (They constantly drop to like 5 bucks for the whole package)DayZ Mod is one of my all-time favorite games with the caveat that its the Epoch Mod for the Mod (modception) that I love the most. Vanilla DayZmod is decent, but nothing beats the base crafting and additional features of Epoch.If you do end up grabbing the game, go and get DayZ Launcher. Some will say to grab DayZ commander, which is fine...I've just had much better experiences with Launcher over the two. You'll need to verify all the files, and both of these programs do that. After that, you can install mods, I'd highly recommend Epoch.When you get into the game, spend some time getting used to the controls. You will eventually make use of nearly every listed control from corner leaning to get a shot in, to the helicopter controls, to the button to toggle your lights on and off. My advice for the first bit of the game is to find a nice, easy PVE server and just♥♥♥♥♥♥around until you get the hang of it.Epoch Survival is then, unoffically, in tiers:Tier 1: Newspawn; you've got what little invetory you have and you need to find food and water to survive. You'll be going house to house looking for weapons and what not. Even if you start with a gun, you don't want to fire it. Sneak around and keep a low profile. Avoid Zeds at all costs until you find a melee weapon.Tier 2: You've got your melee weapon, now find a car or something you can sell to get a car. Make your way north and look for one of the trader towns and sell your loot for enough gold to get a el cheapo car. You'll then use the car to go out looking for better loot -AND- the car can be locked for a kind of mobile base that is safe to store things in when logging off.Tier 3: Save your Gold and get an MTVR. This military truck will hold a TON of items, it can take a hail of bullets, and handels really well off road. It will be your mobile base for a while, and you'll probably hold onto it even after you get 'better' cars and a base. With it, head up to one of the military bases and raid the barracks for weapons. Sell the weapons  you don't upgrade with and start saving for a plot-post (on servers that require them, which is default).Tier 4: When you get a plot post, you'll need to make sure you have pretty much all the toolbelt items (Crowbar, E-tool, hatchet/axe, etc). Find a nice spot and stake your claim by dropping your plot post. Then its time for Lumberjack Simulator 2015. Get out in the woods and start chopping down some trees and collecting wood to start building your base defenses. You don't really need a safe as long as you have a lockable truck, but its up to you.Tier 5: Sticking with the MTVR runs to the military bases, keep farming gold until you get enough to buy a helicopter. Leave your truck at your base locked up and make the run, bike, or whatever to the airbase and buy a Mozzie. Why this uselss♥♥♥♥♥heli? Because you're probably going to crash it. Everyone I have played this game with has crashed their first helicopter, regardless of how many hours they've spent in Arma's helicopter training or Bohemia's helicopter game. Get the mozzie, take it slow and easy staying low to the ground, then when you've got it down, sell it and get your real chopper. Go for the civillian chopper, since its basically an airborn MTVR.Tier 6: Keep hitting military bases, which should now go by even faster. If you think you're up to it, you can try and smash some bandit missions (Depending on the server) for some fast cash and good mats. Keep builing up your base and consider getting a fuel truck. From this point on, you're done 'surviving' Epoch, you're now 'thriving'.Play the game with friends and have even more of a blast.			"

												I recommend this game for anybody intrested in zombie survival. This game makes you feel like you are in a Zombie Apocalypse. It requires you to make Life-Saving decisions in seconds. This game requires skill and patience. If you make one wrong move you might need to start over. There are also mods for this mod. One I recommend is Dayz Epoch. Dayz Epoch adds over 500 new vehicles and over 100 new weapons. Dayz Epoch adds trader areas where you can sell stuff for gold, silver, and a few other metals. With these metals you can buy Land vehicles, Aircrafts, Boats, Weapons, and even other survival goodies. Dayz Epoch gives you the power to build your own base using Plot pole and wood. Dayz epoch is what kept me playing Dayz. If you were to ever buy Arma 2 Combined Arms be sure to pick this up, Also be sure to install Dayz commander to play, it adds A favorites list and sometimes if you play this without Dayz Commander it will say wrong version everytime you try.

												The mod have gone thrugh another update and what does it adds? Well.. nothing much, beside that the base building has came back to the game, which I'm not a big fan and it kinda destroys the survival concept of the game.. enough of that for a moment and let's get in to the point of this review and say what the game is real about.It's been a while since the game got their rewards and most you you wouldn't look at it again after.. some other games coming out and removing the AS50 (!) from the game.. I feel like the game has rached gold age again with the update from the last month and they still keep on going with these. From the beginning you will see that this review is delivered for those who actually played the game or got it already in the past for long time but I'll try to turn back in time for a little while because that's what it provides and that's what I think is the most immportant that's left in this game. The game throws us in to zombie land of Charnorus -or/and vice versa- speaking about this as a world makes us think that it must be pretty big thing to move around on (walkin simulator?) and.. yes, it's.. an open world game aswell! With a mixture of realistic, simulator based combat system and variety if immportant to a player needs which can be challenging sometimes to keep up with them while you're running away from pursuing enemies; and there is plenty of them! Starting from your needs and health contidion status to end it on a players that are going for the same building as you are in a hope of finding this valuble loot. You could say that the game is made of such a little personal goals that you are seeking in any part of the game and this would be the best way to put it. Just planing your safe route to the city might be the starting point of this and thinking of whatever is needed to get this sniper out from that hill would be another level of challenging goals that you want to chose from and pick them as their own because anyone can chase them doing it from all sorts of level of the map and the game.One of the game that should get a chance from anyone who played in the past but also someone who didn't played it at all because anyone can find themselfs in the game.

It's not for people who thinks that this is a easy game, like Call of Duty, but it's for people who want more realism in a game.I played in Chernarus, in Fallujha (best map i think, you need to prove it), Chernarus Epoch, Panthera, Utes and much more. I never, and i said never, get bored.Lots of weapons, awesome graphic engine, pvp, driving and stuff, farming, zombies everywhere, looting... Awesome!10/10 Just a tip: for everyone who want to start to play Dayz, you should play a bit of singleplayer or armory in ArmaII, just for understand the basic of this game.			"

												Somehow this game is really enjoyable. It feels a bit glitchy at times particularly with the AI controlled bandits. And the servers all seem to have to restart every 2-4 hours which can lead to bad timing for a slow loading game. And getting Arma II, Operation arrowhead and day z mod all set up properly was a pain. I found the learning curve to be a bit steep for someone who has never played a survival sim game before and the menu system (particularly the backpack menu) to be absolutely terrible. These previous comments are negative and I find these annoying parts of the game, but then I discovered that stuff happens while you are trying to survive out there. And trying to become more powerful than other players by collecting weapons and vehicles (and stealing stuff from them) becomes addicting. I can't wait for the full standalone version to be completed, but until then this glitchy game is surprisingly great fun.			"

It's good to have friends to play this game or ill get board fast. Group up with people playing the AI in PvE or take chances on a PVP server and great your own destiny. Get to build and stash your thing into safes, Drive Armer Cars or fly a Chopper.			"

												Is this game funny? Yes, it is.Is this game awesome? Yes, it is.But still I wouldn't recommend this game. If compared to the Standalone version this game looks like crap. It's badly optimized, it has much less weapons, helicopters, vehicles and clothes than DayZ Standalone, and it gets updated once every year. Minimum requirements are fake as well, as if you have a low pc you won't ever run this game at more than 20fps, even if you put graphic settings at very low. Maybe with the lowest resolution you could run it, but who is that dumb to play a survival game in 800x600?			"

												I didn't know what to write for my review so here are some facts about ebola!!!Ebola virus disease (EVD; also Ebola hemorrhagic fever, or EHF), or simply Ebola, is a disease of humans and other primates caused by ebolaviruses. Signs and symptoms typically start between two days and three weeks after contracting the virus with a fever, sore throat, muscular pain, and headaches. Then, vomiting, diarrhea and rash usually follow, along with decreased function of the liver and kidneys. At this time some people begin to bleed both internally and externally. The disease has a high risk of death, killing between 25 and 90 percent of those infected with an average of about 50 percent. This is often due to low blood pressure from fluid loss, and typically follows six to sixteen days after symptoms appear.The virus spreads by direct contact with body fluids, such as blood, of an infected human or other animals. This may also occur through contact with an item recently contaminated with bodily fluids.[1] Spread of the disease through the air between primates, including humans, has not been documented in either laboratory or natural conditions.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥or breast milk of a person after recovery from EVD may still carry the virus for several weeks to months. Fruit bats are believed to be the normal carrier in nature, able to spread the virus without being affected by it. Other diseases such as malaria, cholera, typhoid fever, meningitis and other viral hemorrhagic fevers may resemble EVD. Blood samples are tested for viral RNA, viral antibodies or for the virus itself to confirm the diagnosis.Control of outbreaks requires coordinated medical services, alongside a certain level of community engagement. The medical services include rapid detection of cases of disease, contact tracing of those who have come into contact with infected individuals, quick access to laboratory services, proper healthcare for those who are infected, and proper disposal of the dead through cremation or burial. Samples of body fluids and tissues from people with the disease should be handled with special caution. Prevention includes limiting the spread of disease from infected animals to humans. This may be done by handling potentially infected bush meat only while wearing protective clothing and by thoroughly cooking it before eating it. It also includes wearing proper protective clothing and washing hands when around a person with the disease.No specific treatment or vaccine for the virus is available, although a number of potential treatments are being studied. Supportive efforts, however, improve outcomes. This includes either oral rehydration therapy (drinking slightly sweetened and salty water) or giving intravenous fluids as well as treating symptoms. The disease was first identified in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks, one in Nzara, and the other in Yambuku, a village near the Ebola River from which the disease takes its name. EVD outbreaks occur intermittently in tropical regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Between 1976 and 2013, the World Health Organization reports a total of 24 outbreaks involving 1,716 cases. The largest outbreak is the ongoing epidemic in West Africa centered in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. As of 11 April 2015, this outbreak has 25,626 reported cases resulting in 10,619 deaths.I R8 A VERY GR8 8/8 PLS DONT H8 AND TRY NOT TO MAKE IT B8 BUT QUICKSCOPING IS MY F8 PEACE OUT GONNA MASTURB8 ON YOUR LAMINATE FLOORING M8!!!!

												Have to say, one of my favorite games out there. So much to do, to see, ANYTHING. Plus, not a toxic community. :) Heres my life story.-Spawns in by elektro-After an hour of looting, finds an AKs-74u, a mosin nagant, and a baseball bat with other stuff.-Finds 2 bambies.-Bambies Dance like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.-sniper shoots one in the head right in front of me-We go in firestation.-through the window i see the sniper, Realizing that 5 minutes ago he had ran right infront of me with out saying a word :)-Other bambie dies.-I peak and shoot sniper in the foot once and he dies.-zambies come for me, but when i run at them, they run away.-I die by some glitch 15/10 will chase zombies away again			"

												This mod is very good fun, but you need some sort of outside updater like playwithSIX or DayZCommander, because the steam version is 5 some odd versions behind. The vanilla version of DayZ is punishing, but I personnaly like the slightly more difficult Origins mod. Like I said, you'll need some sort of outside launcher to play Origins or any of the other variants, but if you get it working, it's great fun.11/10 Would buy ARMA II CO again just for this.BE WARNED, THE BANDITS ARE COMING!Haha, JKThis game is awesomeGet it.

												Absolute garbage, mod or not. Maybe if you're an autist with an ungodly amount of patience you can find enjoyment, but even then I doubt it. For those familiar with ARMA, it's similar in concept, but the execution is terrible. Interface is clunky and unresponsive, zombie AI is laughable as they jitter and zig zag haphazardly and glitch out uncontrollably. Forget words like matchmaking, navigating to a server through the sea of CU$T0M [300+ ITEMS M0D] SERV3RZ is a struggle in itself (Look into DayZ Commander if you're hellbent on a bad time). Clearly any kind of melee system was not anticipated in ARMA, and it reflects itself in Day Z. This is the worst FPS and survival experience I've played to date. Hyper realism is wasted on sluggish controls and a terrible GUI, you won't have time to enjoy bullet trajectory while you're panicked, starving, and hyperventilating from tripping on your own legs. Prepare yourself to wander aimlessly for hours through the ""massive scale"" in a desolate wasteland trying to figure out the controls (or location) while picking up empty food cans, before you die a hundred frustrating deaths and lose everything-- all the while facing the elistist community. The difficulty lie not in the zombies or players, but in the constant struggle against a buggy, awful game.This isn't difficult in the way Dark Souls or STALKER's Misery Mod is, it's like driving a broken tricyle backwards during a marathon. Even at ultra-low HumbleBundle price, I regret my purchase immensely and I truly misunderstand anyone liking this game.			"

												I don't understand why the movement system and inventory have to be so ungodly clunky. The controls in general feel pretty awful. I've seen better inventories on under-the-radar no budget rpgs, and my character insists on leaning, shambling, and making erratic, unwarranted movements. My only possible explanation for this is that he's doing it to fit in with the zombies. I have never had so much trouble in a game trying to walk (Or god forbid, RUN) in a straight line.			"

												If you already have Arma 2 + Operation Arrowhead you can give DayZ mod a shot, if not I wouldn't recommend the investment.Very Interesting to play during it's release time (at this time I defenitely would have recommend it) but since the standalone of DayZ was released there is almost no more support, developement and players for the mod. Also there is no kind of late-game or long time motivation to play, playing alone is boring and you probably just die constantly. I also don't believe that the mod or standalone will ever get near a final state.			"

												I have been playing a long time using dayz commander not on steam. It is impossible to get started or even enjoy this game if you are going to be playing by yourself. Get some friends or don't play. (iunless you like running around for hours on end and getting shot and having to run around again.)But here's how it normally goes.You spawn in on the coast with nothing but a pistol and a bandage. You run around for over an hour looking for some gear. Picking up a soda here, a can of beans there. BAM! Some fully geared player just shot you before you could even get a weapon. On your second try you spawn in and run around four another 2 hours and finally find a low level waepon like a lee enfield. You then see someone, get excited and say ""hello! are you friendly?"" and BAM!. they shoot you and take your gear without a word. This cycle repeats over and over until you realize you just spent 8 hours running and getting shot on sight and running around and getting shot on sight and running around and getting shot and never really accomplishing anything.  EVERYONE shoots on sight in this game. EVERYONE. Unless you have some friends to cover your back this will keep happening to you. It's not a open world survival game... it's a giant free-for-all deathmatch.  I wouldn't reccomend this game to anyone who is planning on playing it by themselves.  You will get frustrated and bored very quicly.			"

												So i played other survival games, and this one I always thought that i would have a nice experience, but it wasn't, unfortunately i spent some money to buy arma and all expansions just to play dayz mod, i know i didn't have to buy, but i wanted to try arma too 'cause it seemed to be a nice game, but dayz is wrong in so many ways that i don't even know where to start, there is no real game servers, ervery server is different in it's on way so this is bad as you'll never really be playing dayz, you'll be playing some shell to arma and every server has it's on start caractheristics, for example, if you are washed away on the shores of an unknow continent, YOU DON'T HAVE A GLOCK! you'll have your bare fists or a knife any kind of melee weapon and that's it, for only one reason, if you're in a zombie apocalipse, BULLETS WON'T LAST FOREVER! so you just start the game without know how to play with a glock in hand 17 bullets and 3 mags, good the ♥♥♥♥ing zombies are god damn USAIN BOLTS they run, they attack like at a lot of speed. IGNORE ALL THAT and you'll have people that don't care if you're new, so if you plan on testing this game, go on but just don't expect something better than the others game on the market, it is by far the worst survival experience i've ever had.Good luck!

It keeps giving me this error saying it needs files from the free version of ARMA 2. Knowing that the free version of ARMA 2 has been discontinued i feel like i just wasted 60$ on a game. Also knowing that this is possible i would like to get a refund of the game seems how i cant use it and I also know that steam does give refunds of games that people have purchased because a family member has gotten a refund of the same game for the same reasons.

												I dont like it, its better to buy the standalone than play this crap. The game is fun but the zombies are horrible. The zombie animations are crap and melee weapons are useless. Its not fun when you're scaveging for supplies and all of a sudden, you are forced to defend yourself with melee weapons that only work at point blank range and aimed center mass ogf the zombie or it will not even hit him.It has a ton of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers, making it hard to connect to most of them, but if you actually join one, you realize that the server has been running for 10 hours and almost all areas have been looted clean of supplies. have fun looting empty coke cans all day. I played for nearly 5 hours and i hate this mod. Hopefully the standalone is better. "

												Its one of THE BEST games I've ever played. It takes surviving to a whole new level! With the harsh conditions of the game to the player atmoshphere, DayZ is awesome. It's the constant fear of doing things that keep you on edge. Such as, the fear if approaching another player or the fear of entering this building that may have very valuable gear. Always love it, alwasy play it.			"

You are one of the few that have survived and now you must search this new wasteland in order to fight for your life against what is left of the indigenous population now infected with the disease. Go solo, team up with friends or take on the world, as you choose your path in this brutal and chilling landscape using whatever means you stumble upon to survive.			"

Load ArmA 2, then ArmA 2: OA and then DayZ (choose the 1.8.7 version underneath the  Copy and paste the ArmA 2 files (or just AddOns apparently) into ArmA 2: OA folder. Download the Overwatch mod via https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gov6ocm697esi2u/AACDG0kskKPUXvJgan3q__EWa?dl=0 and extract the @dayzoverwatch  into the ArmA 2: OA Folder Download the Epoch mod via torrents (get BitTorrent or uTorrent or something) and extract the DayZ_Epoch folder into the ArmA 2: OA Folder. Download the Origins Launcher (or alternatively get the torrent and extract the @OriginsMod into the ArmA 2: OA Folder) and install the mod. Set Launch Options in ArmA 2: OA to -mod=@Dayz -mod=@dayzoverwatch -mod=@DayZ_Epoch -mod=@OriginsMod (change accordingly and make sure that anything else goes AFTER this). Enjoy! "

												Sure, after all this time the mod is still littered with bugs, but it is still my favorite game of all time. I am absolutely fascinated by it. The graphics, the audio, the ability the game has to immerse you into the world and just how real it feels is worth mentioning all on its own. I felt every emotion there is to feel in this game and loved every moment of it. Its just a shame that its nothing like it used to be with the new modded servers and exploits and all that... nobody plays it for the immersive experience anymore.			"

												Please do not bother to play this..... It's such a waste of time & money... Super buggy, Unreliable Servers , Badly Optimized , etc. You'd be better buying the DayZ Standalone , it's much better & you will save more money + more giggabyes. Arma Games are gigabyte eaters.			"

												This is my first review, and I have to say I am disapointed. I have bounced around games like this such as H1Z1, and I simply cannot stand trying to play this game. Don't get me wrong, after wasting whole days trying to find a server I can actually join, the game can be pretty fun. But it is all not worth it for how much digging, downloading this, deleting this file in these particular orders. I just want to play the game. I have played a total of maybe an hour of actual game time? I've dug around for servers for around 28 hours, according to my AOA log time.			"

												I know this seems like an awesome mod at first (which it is, at times, rarely, but the moments are still there) but after a few days of playing, you start to realize how pointless and hopeless this game is. You find some stuff, you get a weapon, you meet a person and 9 out of 10 times they shoot you on sight. I don't blame them though, cause that's just how this mod is. Everyone you see will either want to kill you or avoid you, but mostly kill you. Even the good guys. Either because they can't trust anyone they meet because they've been betrayed so many times or because you have something they want.I actually recommend this more than the standalone because the standalone is so boring, there's almost no content, it's pretty buggy and there's only one single map whereas in ArmA 2's mod, there's like 100 different maps and people have made 100 different versions of the mod like Breaking Point or DayZero, etc.If you do own ArmA 2 CO and haven't tried this yet then I suggest you do. The game is great both with friends and by yourself, because by yourself you're not drawing so much attention and you can do your own thing whereas with friends you can defend yourself much easier, you can scavenge quicker and you can have a bigger view over stuff, such as one person guarding and the other one looting.I do enjoy this mod at times though, when you just run into some super friendly person and you go on adventuers all over the map only for him to be killed and you scream ""NOOO!"" into the mic while spraying his killers, then crying over his corpse, sucking it up, looting him dry and throw yourself back out in the wilderness, alone and hungry, yet again.

												Warning, this game is only replayable and can offer the full experience with a group of friends. DO NOT BUY WITHOUT HAVING SOMEBODY TO PLAY WITH. This is a great experience and gives the most lifelike zombie apocolypse simulator. This game has great immersion until you find something quite common in the game, a zombie. These walking monstrosities break the game flow and any sense of immersion. The zombie combat is a mess with the ridiculous hit detection, and amount of hits with a melee weapon or with a gun. Not only the ridiculous combat is a problem but the shotty animations is a huge problem. The zombies with walk over to you, ♥♥♥♥ing flail their arms at you and you take massive damage for an attack that looked like it was done in a 4th of the time that it should. The game is terribly broken and almost all deaths are unfair leaving you in a rage state. This game may be fun to watch but sure as hell is not fun to play/			"

												A really fun and challenging zombie shooter. It is completely different from any other zombie shooter I've ever played, and it can also get really competative. It's an open world map where zombies are dangerous and humans are deadly. Everything is trying to kill you, but you can either be a lone wolf, or travel in a group of friends. However, I would not recommend this game for people who are good by nature, because trying to lend out a helping hand to a fellow survivor will earn you a bullet to the face. This game is great for playing with a friend or two and going out being bandit survivors, working as a team and scavenging military bases and making one of your own. However, there aren't really many servers left and it's hard to find one that works, runs well, has good rules, and has players. 7/10.			"

My friend has a gaming computer and it still crashes on his. Please take this review into consideration before installing this product.			"

												Getting the game to even run in the first place was far more difficult than something I'm paying money for should be, but it is a mod so I'd give it a pass due to the ease of finding the necessary information via the community.  Once the game actually starts running though, it is impossible to find a server to actually play on--which is required if you want to do anything beyond watching the menu screen.  I bought this and ArmA and all its extras for $5 on a Humble Bundle sale a while back, and even though I'm sure ArmA is a fine game, I didn't buy the pack for it and I'm not interested in ever playing it--I dislike this game (DayZ) so much, I want my measley $5 back.

												Tons of untapped potential.  I've dusted this one off twice in the past couple years.  First, it's horribly optimized for online play, which is only a factor if you don't have near-unlimited broadband.  Forget playing this on a hotspot or other ISP which limits your data; the game sucks up around 100MB/hour.  And expect to play for a long time, since much of the game is walking, hiding, or crawling. And, be prepared for ""alpha release"" glitches that haven't been fixed in the 5 or so years since this game was released.  In summary, this could have been a great game but for whatever reason it was never patched/optimized beyond ""alpha"" release and as such should only be fodder for existing super-hardcore fans.			"

												DayZ is one of the most famous mods in the world, and I can see why to some degree if you are really into super slow paced gameplay with a huge build up and lack of content all in the name of realism, but me personally find this zombie survival sim esque game to be a total drag, it has boring gameplay, satisfactory AI, pretty good multiplayer to be fair (in terms of ability to set up/join/play with friends/etc.), terrible graphics for it's time (obviously it is an Arma II mod though, so can't really complain, for Arma II's time it has decent graphics), decent engine, no story or dialog, replayability but playing it just the once is like pulling teeth, ok sound effects and simple apocalypse style world design (which you can't complain at too much either).Overall this game is a huge load of non-content, playing this on your own is a bore and with friends isn't much better. My advice to those who want this because of some sort of video is to not go and buy the two games needed for it (I can't speak on behalf of the stand-alone game). This game does look good on video but when actually playing for a decent amount of time, you'll see just how little this game has to offer, unless of course as I said earlier this game is exactly what you want (which I thought it was due to my love and fascination of this kind of scenario, it sounded too good to be true, to be able to simulate my dream of an apocalypse with the fight for survival including zombies, but no).7/15 - ""Not as good as it looks""			"

												After years of being public, this game randomly doesn't work, glitches, crashes, refuses to run, has no support and has no solid concept what so ever. While you play, you randomly get disconnects. Servers restart every few hours, so should you get killed, if you don't make it to your corpse before server restart, your stuff is gone. Realms are plagued with children randomly killing everyone on sight, and there is no role-playing part of the game what so ever. Different servers have different mods and customizations, that doesn't work most of the time, and if they do, players are tied down with a long list of rules of what you can or cannot do, where, and how (i.e. not killing near ""safe zones"", in them, no building near them, in houses, or ""high loot areas."", etc). With all this, if you happen to finally be lucky to find something nice, you are likely to experience some bug which will cause the item to disappear, like if you are holding a weapon, you find a better one, you click on the item in the menu 'Take ""better gun"" (drop ""your current gun"")', your current gun gets destroyed and you only have the new one. If you switch guns, the one you just took out of your backpack never has a magazine in it. Switching between guns in combat is useless, as your character needs to stop moving altogether, stands for couple of seconds while switching guns and then you are allowed to move again. Sometimes you glitch through the stairs and die. Sometimes someone glitches through a wall and steals your car. Sometimes you glitch through a wall and appear on the other side of the building going up the ladder. This piece of software is pure garbage - I'll always love to watch Frankie's videos of him playing the game, I just don't have the nerves to play it myself.			"

You never get to play as a human again, but who would want to? Get dayz now!JK I lied. This game sucks. There are no working severes and you always spawn as a bird. Get the standalone instead if you want to play a game, instead of looking at a screen of severs.			"

												If you are buying Arrowhead for the DayZ mod then I wouldnt. I have the Dayz Stand Alone and its way way way better then this Arma 2 mod crap. You have to do so much downloading to run the mod, its nothing like DayZ, each time you spawn in with a weapon. you can only search some houses not a lot like DayZ SA. I have been bugged what happened was my guy was running and I couldnt stop him he just kept on going. I had to exit the game. All people do is camp and snipe. Its like BF4 with zombies. The in game chat is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, everyone act's like a a hole because your new. all the admins are a fkin joke. the mod is garbage and I have no idea how its even got good reviews.  if you wanna buy the game and download 6 some odd files to run the mod or by Dayz SA and download just the game you pick. The mod is sh!t and i regret buying it. I will def stick with DayZ SA.			"

Just don't forget to continuously update and patch your game every day, because we don't want a fantastic, fun-packed 30 minute connection wait to be ruined by a message telling you the server is running a version which is 0.1.1.1.2 newer than yours now, do we?

But really though, this mod is ♥♥♥♥ing bad I'd rather have my kneecaps scraped off by a butter knife held by an epileptic person at a disco party than play this any more. Legit the first hour of my time was spent getting the stupid mod to even connect me to servers. This included reinstalling battle-eye, validating caches, moving files around, getting lost files from other locations, and generally just dealing with bugs.So yeah, if you cant tell, I dont recommend this game, just go out and please buy standalone, people may say its worse, but ♥♥♥♥, it is 1000 time better than this.Still not worse than Archeblade, that game is ♥♥♥♥ing horrible.

After much trouble shooting and an awfull lot of extra content and mod downloading aswell as the New DayZ Launcher, I am yet to play any online game. none of the servers are stable. I am using ge force gtx 940 and 16gb ram and high speed internet and its just too buggy to get any overall enjoyment from. I have lost all faith in the DayZ developers and regret wasting yet again more time and more money this.			"

												All this mod is is a running from zombie simulator. So you spawn. You run around 25-60 feet and you usually pickup a zombie. Then you start running from that zombie and another one will appear. So on so forth. This is honestly not fun at all unless you take the zombies out or make them A LOT less OP than they are. 2.5/10			"

												I understand alot of people play and thoroughly enjoy this game. I had one game in this mod and because of the experience I had I have chosen to never play this again and becuase of what happened, do not recomend the game.Load into a server. Look around. Get a grasp of the basic  controls. See some zombies in the distance. Know I have to stay away until I get some weapons. Spot some buildings. Start heading to the buildings. It is a small yard with a small building. I sneak into the building, find a basic pistol. Exit the building and as I am about to leave the yard I hear a zombie on the other side of the fence. I freeze, I don't know what to do. I follow the noise of the zombie running around the border of the fence (corrugated so I didn't actually see it, just hear). Zombie came running around the corner but as I was not moving, as soon as it saw me it stopped, turned and started to walk away. At this point and time I  hear a noise, turn and this bus seems to materialize next to where I was standing. All these players exit fulling kitted out with weapons etc and shoot me. I am now lying on the ground, bleeding out. They are yelling at me, can you hear us. Answer us. Have you a mic. Answer us and well heal you. As I had only just started playing I had no idea what the voip was. What the chat was. And so I bleed out and died. Due to these bunch of community players I have not desire to be involved in a community like this.I have seen some great footage out there of bands of players helping each other out, banding togeither to survive. If I had had that kind of experience I may have even purchased the full game? But due to the experience I had. I just cant recoment it.It was other players that caused me to not like this game mode!

												This game doesn't want to be played.When you install the game, it will install two versions that need to be turned on and off depending on what you want to do with the game. You have to download more mods and files to play what everyone else is playing because you have to be part of a community to join a server. There are also no servers with people playing anything that you can join without having to setup configuration. This is a bootleg stick shift of a game.

												So I bought Arma II, and the DayZ mod, which was probably the buggiest piece of unfinished crap ever crapped out by a dev, not to mention overpriced, and hideously ugly, and never even close to finished. It's the most I've ever regretted  buying a game. Yet somehow, now, they want me to buy it AGAIN (the standalone version), for another 35 bucks, for another unfinished, buggy piece of crap, that will obviously never be finished either.These are the greediest, absolute worst developers in the industry.-100/10  G.F.Y			"

												Couple years on since this mod arrived I recently decided I would give it ago after having it for almost 2 years in my games list. After upgrading my gaming system I reinstalled it via STEAM just to get know where. I have absolutely no idea what the trick or method is to run this mod with all the other ARMA 2 components installed, using PlayWithSix and DayZ commander I still cannot find a single available server.I decided to uninstall it, assuming that the mod is dead and instead I am looking into purchasing the DayZ Standalone game instead. Hopefully somebody can advise on how to play this mod correctly.So for now I will not rate the game out of 10 as I have not been able to play it but I will also NOT recommend it as I don't think I am the only one struggling to get it working.

												I don't recommend this. After 5 days of figuring out the problem I need to get dayz commaner after I FOLLOWED the guide lines and looked on youtube. I had to download all updates and problems before the viruses showed up. Then when it was done I went on it and it had many glitches and lags that I gave up. Then I had internet problems and figure out it was dayz that was causing the viruses. So i delete it and never had a problem and yes i download dayz commander at dayz website. Also why get this arma 2 version which glitches out when you can get it at steam store. It costs a bit but probably dosen't glitch out.			"

												Outdated game with only a small core fan base left. The community treats each other like trash, server admins give their friends benifits and will mess with you (kill you, make you lose your stuff, ect) if they don't like you for whatever reason. I got banned from one of the servers for simply pointing out some bugs in the game itself. Basically if you really like the year 2000 and want to waste like $5 for a terrible game, go for it.			"

												Antes que nada me gustaría destacar que este emocianante juego tiene 5 puntos centrales:1)Esperar que pongan las avariciosas ofertas de Steam.2)Comprar el juego después de salir reiteradas veces a violentar algún Fravega.3)Instalar el ARMA II y re cagarte en todo porque te olvidaste de comprar la♥♥♥♥♥♥expansión del Arrowhead, cagarte de hambre 3 meses porque toda la plata de tus atracos a la raza vil y laburante la gastaste en tucas o cartovino.5)Comerte un delicioso choripan chorreante de grasa en la Costanera.Sinceramente, el juego es como un simulador de los saqueos en pleno invierno de Gripe A, sin mucho que decir. Pero bueno, mejor hablarles de mi breve pero curiosa anécdota tratando de instalar esta garompa enfierrada a la que llaman ""DayZ"":Primero me volví pelotudo para poder pagar el jueguillo, terminaron las ofertas y me olvidé de comprar la expansión para poder jugar al DayZ. Posteriormente me vi obligado a llamar a Hackerman, ya que el juego no funcaba y a mi primo lo banearon antes de poder entrar a un server. Después de meterme en Skynet, matar a Robert Patrick y salvar al mundo de ser absorbido por la nariz cocainómana de Moria Casán, el juego se arregló mágicamente y pude entrar a jugar. Rapidamente me desilucioné cuando descubrí que el juego era una verdadera e inexorable pija.También me gustaría aclarar que después de corregir todos los errores del juego mi Facebook creció 30 centimetros y mi poronga cambió de color (si desea saberse, de un matiz rubí, similar al de tu profunda y abismal concha los días en los que se te cae el tuco, en la cual incontables veces llevé a naufragar al monigote de carne).

												So; Eventually I have read ``hundreds`, if not `thousands`` of posts about this game DayZ which is not DayZ. A game Hundreds (if not Thousands) of players are Unable to play.Eventually Steam put out a notice long after I bought it acknowleding there was/is some confusion.I now know DayZ is not DayZ, because my thread was locked by a DayZ Mod for asking. I cant remember if it was on the DayZ forum or the DayZ forum; but it was one of them.So; here is a DayZ Mod confirming that the game I bought to play DayZ is not the game DayZ.QUOTE:-Pacifist  Moderator 1 hour ago DayZ mod is not the DayZ standalone. You do not own the DayZ Standalone.UNQUOTE			"

												1,000+ Hours on recordThis is a really good game, although the only problem I have with it, is that it doesn't really keep track of time played through steam. Often users have to download Dayz Commander to find servers, which isn't connected to steam.This game is amazing, there are plenty of mods you can do too when you get bored of the default. I suggest Dayz Epoch (keep in mind all mods are free, you can get them through dayz commander). This  mod allows you to not only sell and buy items with gold/iron/silver currency. You can also build your own custom base! Make a tower or what ever.. Or go get a gun and go hunting for people :) Very fun game, just expect to do a LOT of running-A LOT better, and different then the Dayz Stand Alone			"

												I hate this game. Don't get me wrong, I love it. Just...bugs...Good points: there is not a more brutal online survival game. This is a game you may stop playing because it is actually too good...or because the enemy has a gun and you don't, and even if you do, you probably aren't careful enough and die anyway. Try enough you will learn how to survive (usually try #43) and is incredibly rewarding for being careful, observant and...well...better than your opponents..who are anywhere and everywhere.Bad points: To survive making your way inland (coast is perilous), finding a working vehicle, losing vehicle cos you didn't hide it well enough, walking the rest of wherever you are going, being ambushed by 4 vastly superior and better armed bandits and surviving by the skin of your teeth with one enfield rifle and 4 bullets because you landed a hit with a bullet on their key buddy that rendered him unconscious, sprinting through a forest to get away, finding a house with food, sprinting away again to escape AI zombies, only to be one shot killed by a zombie in a barn because the hit marker system bugged out when you landed an axe on the zombie's head which didn't kill it, can be infuriating.So in short: great game, just prepare for bugs. Otherwise, every other time you die will be your own fault because you were outsmarted. Oh and the hordes of AI zombies are the least of your problems, and also trust no one. Use DayZ Commander to manage the game (I have more hours on record than the 1 hour Steam says I have). Enjoy.			"

												The only game I've ever played where my heart would race by the simple act of killing another player. Once you get used to the mechanics of the system and have yourself armed and ready for any possible threat, the interactions you have with other survivors has you literally shaking from the concern of one owns safety. Yes, you can respawn and start from scratch after you die, but the struggle of surviving the constant barrage of zombies and player encounters whilst savaging for goods, builds on the value of the current life you are current controlling. This mod is the pioneer of the genre and must play for anyone who has thought about playing a GTA style game with zombies.			"

												The game is great when you can play but the server set up is complete garbage. Hosting is also a pain and not a out of the box solution. It requries the opening of ports in your firewall and making sure any nescessary ports are forwarded in your router. I still can't get this game to work well. I got into one game by randomly choosing a server but I don't know how thats going to work in the future seeing how GameSpy is shutting down in the end of May 2014. I've heard about a lot of people having fun with this game but for me it is probably the worst $10 I've spent in a while.			"

												MY EXPIERENCE HAS BEEN THE OPPSOITE OF WHAT EVRYONE SAYS REGARDING STANDALONE AND MOD!!!1. There are a lot more bandits on this than the standalone.2. Standalone has much worse connection and dsynch issues than this mod, to a point where someone I meet and is friendly (in standalone, this backs up my statement about 1) is talking to me and I am talking to him (best get a mic or most people will think your a bandit because you aren't willing to speak to them and instead talking to your buddies on skype or TS on how to ambush the other player, not knowing you don't have a mic) and all of a sudden some serious dysynch happens wjere I completely lose him while we are running down the coast. While in the Mod (the one your looking at right now) I have only had some minor lag ONCE and never major Lag.3. You can customize your charecter: NO YOU CAN'T... Only in other versions (which you will have to download with dayZ commander or PlayWithSix) YOU CAN FIND PREMADE OUTFITS, customizing is done very, very, well in Standalone however.4.(nOBODY MENTIONS tHIS BUT...)

												DayZ the mod is still where its at. I finally bough OA after 3 years of owning just Arma II and I wish I had sooner. If so I wouldn't have wasted 30 on DayZ SA. Like many prominent DayZ youtubers have stated like Frankie, DayZ SA jsut doesnt have the core mechanics. The gunplay is clunky and guns feel highly inaccurate and bullets are like pebbles.Being able to talk to other players and ""shoot the♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; makes for a much more enjoyable experience. You dont have to eat 4 cans of beans to no longer be starving, or drink 15 sodas. The community is much more solid and Kill on Sight isn't as large a problem. Infact I was only KOSed once so far in the mod, and I am giving the player the benefit of the doubt, because I had just killed a zombie near a player corpse and was going to loot said corpse and I can only assume they though I killed the player and was a bandit. Hopefully one day the SA will be jsut as good if not better, but till then the mod is still the place to be. And its well worth the cost of Arma II and OA. Not to mention all the other Aram mods you can play, oh and don't forget about Arma II now ;)			"

												The DayZ ArmA 2 mod is a fantasic mod. But alas, every game isn't perfect. To run the mod to expectation DayZ Commander is highly recommended. But if you want to play on extra maps such as Epoch, or Panthera, you will need to install those from the Commander. The thing is, if this mod didn't require so many add-ons for itself, it would be a MILLION times better. Aside from that the gameplay is fun, and so is the overall realism that a good survival game should have. And if more players didn't kill anyone on sight, well.... that would be even better. FYI, look out for angry squeakers.			"

												The game is great when you can play but the server set up is complete garbage. Hosting is also a pain and not a out of the box solution. It requries the opening of ports in your firewall and making sure any nescessary ports are forwarded in your router. I still can't get this game to work well. I got into one game by randomly choosing a server but I don't know how thats going to work in the future seeing how GameSpy is shutting down in the end of May 2014. I've heard about a lot of people having fun with this game but for me it is probably the worst $10 I've spent in a while.			"

												1,000+ Hours on recordThis is a really good game, although the only problem I have with it, is that it doesn't really keep track of time played through steam. Often users have to download Dayz Commander to find servers, which isn't connected to steam.This game is amazing, there are plenty of mods you can do too when you get bored of the default. I suggest Dayz Epoch (keep in mind all mods are free, you can get them through dayz commander). This  mod allows you to not only sell and buy items with gold/iron/silver currency. You can also build your own custom base! Make a tower or what ever.. Or go get a gun and go hunting for people :) Very fun game, just expect to do a LOT of running-A LOT better, and different then the Dayz Stand Alone			"

												This is a great mod especially if you get DayzCommander. The reason that I say this is because DayzCommander finds all versions of the game that is compatible with the current version that you have, plus it lets you download other mods for this game and not only that but it also lets you run dayz without having to launch steam (which is why my account says that I have played dayz for less than an hour when in reality i have been play for about three plus hours a day for about FIVE months). The main mod that I recommend is Epoch. What Epoch does is it gives more purpose to dayz by adding an economic system into the game. With this mod you can go all lone wolf or team up with a group to make a base and team up to do special missions on a server such as kill the bandits at a bandit stock pile and take the loot which might include an As50 tws and if your really lucky ammo for it. So far the server that I have found for the dayz mod that has been the best and most exciting is Blackhearts DayZ Epoch. This server usually fills up close to full most dayz and it almost always has admins on (you may not know it has an admin on at the time because some are unanounced admins that watch for hackers)			"

												The Basics: Infamous zombie survival shooterPrevious Time Spent: 8 minutesExpectation of learning Curve: MediumWhy I bought this: The infamy of the Day-Z mod, great previous writing about itFirst Impressions: Similar feeling of really being in a place that I felt with ARMA II (which makes sense since it's the same engine and the same basic setting). Visuals are a bit dated since it was released roughly 5 year ago, but not so bad as to break immersion. This was immediately frightening and immersive. My first run in the game lasted roughly ten minutes, and involved running to a gas station, trying to commandeer a van, and being killed by zombies.   My 3 Hours with the Game: I signed into a Russian server to play this game, and spent my entire 3 hour evaluation period there. Over a number of runs, I found myself slowly learning the systems of the game, such as where to scavenge for things, how to sort of escape zombies, and general inventory management. Most of my time was spent walking or running through the zombie infested post-soviet countryside. That countryside, and all of the villages and towns were dotted with the undead, and salvageable  supplies. On a couple of runs, I found firearms and ammo, leading to overconfidence and extra danger. Actually hitting zombies and downing them was refreshingly challenging. I generally felt like a regular person dropped into a dangerous situation and trying to survive. And in a couple of instances, especially with human contact, this turned nightmarish.My highlight: The first time I ran into another human player in the game, I was running down the coast road past a gas station, with the hope of finding a van. Zombies were close on my tail, and I could hear them grunting behind me. As I passed the gas station, I saw a man with a gun, standing on top of a building. I didn't stop, due to the horde of undead on my tail, and kept running down the road, spotting a factory in the distance, and hoping to lose the zombies inside. A short time after passing the gas station, I heard the report of a rifle going off, and I kept running.I came upon an abandoned factory, and came inside, making my way up ladders, hoping to not be followed by the zombies. I climbed to a sort of catwalk, and heard gunshots again, and the sound of breaking glass and bullets whizzing by. So, I ran along the catwalk, making my way to a set of interior rooms, connected by stairwells. I saw a hatchet in one of the rooms, but the zombies caught up to me, causing me to retreat up the stairs again before grabbing it. From there, the human caught up to me as well, and I spent a short time trying to evade him, and the zombies in the ruined factory. Eventually I came out onto the catwalk again, and came to a point where he seemed to have a good shot at me, so I panicked and jumped, risking the fall. I landed hard, apparently breaking a leg. The screen faded and blurred, representing pain, but I was able to crawl out of the factory. I heard some more gunshots, but crawled through the long grass, escaping my tormentor, and eventually bleeding out alone outside the factory.  My verdict: This is a game I like a lot, and expect to play beyond the three hours. The experience is terrifying and compelling, and allowed for some amazing emerging narratives. I would recommend this, but I'd also suggest checking if the standalone version of the mod is easier to get ahold of.			"

												This game is amazing. It gives you hours of fun, and action, with in-depth exploration. You really don't need to say that much about it. Now when you start it you can only choose servers that run the mission 'DayZMod' not the one's like Epoch and such, which are mods with in a mod (*inception bawww*). While it gives you limited options with playing you can choose DayZ Launcher (Which is the new one since DayZ Commander went up and died on all of us), which has a LOT more servers you can play on, and you can install things like Epoch so you can play on those servers.This game really isn't for everyone because this game requires some patience. For example, it takes like 15 minutes to walk from Cherno to Elecktro (towns within the game). And on populated servers it can be a warzone on the coast (where you spawn), because bandits try to kill the fresh-spawns. But once you get past hours of walking, and avoiding bandits, its an awesome game. Good luck to you if you play! 9/10			"

Fantastic mod for Arma 2.I have put around 3-4 hours in this game in total, and so far I'm pretty impressed. It's very challenging and fun, it fits so well with Arma 2. But, the only thing I would complain about is the zombie AI. The zombie AI is really just awful, there will be a situation where a one is right in front of me and it takes like 4-6 shots to hit it. This is not because of my accuracy, this is because the AI is very jittery and the zombies move all over the place. Other than that, everything else about the game rocks.			"

												Fantastic concept, unfortunately poorly executed, the ARMA 2 engine looks fantastic but plays like a dog turd.There are so many problems with the DAYZ mod it's unbelievable and now the standalone is out none of them will be fixed and it will fade away. I only hope the standalone with the ARMA 3 engine is a lot better than this as in my opinion with all the DAYZ mods faults its simply not worth the bother playing.On the other hand if it is easier to play with smoothed out control system, then DAYZ standalone will be a hell of a game.

												I find this game both relaxing and exhilirating.  I play solo and don't usually kill-on-sight (KOS) so my adventures are not as action packed as most others, but it's still thrilling dealing with zombies and avoiding contact with other ""survivors"".  There are glitches, there are cheaters, there are cry-babies, there are evil sick twisted individuals... It's whether or not you're willing to overlook those and emmerse yourself in a post-apocolyptic region surviving the elements and the hazards where there are no rules.With the DayZ Stand Alone (SA) out in early-release, I've chosen to remain within the mod until SA becomes more of a survival challenge and not another version of Call of Duty...Depending on the mod, the map, the clan, the server population... your experience could be the worst or the best.  For me, it's a great escape from reality and the ONLY game that has EVER given me an incredible adrenaline rushing, heart pounding, terror laced virtual experience!			"

												While the game is still a thrill to play I have to point out one thing. The community can be a total d*ucheface. People claim they leave because of empty promises from rocket but truly they leave because everyone is as*holes. People will kill fresh spawns, people will hack and give you the best guns which ruins the whole point of finding loot, and people will curse you out for complaining about no loot. Most likely the response is ""you arent looking in the right places"". Lol Ive checked cherno, electro, balota, stary and north airfield. There is nothing bro. And then they will say you suck. A+ for community.Like I said the game is still fun but the community sucks. Almost as bad as counterstrike and cod. You know what? maybe worse because you have nothing to lose in those games except the match. so there it is dayz by far has the worst community			"

If you're finding yourself running out of things to do, I'd recommend playing EPOCH rather than the vanilla Day Z. If youre server doesnt have craftible bikes then you should find a new one, because the map is huge and no one likes running for an hour.The only cons I have for this game are the many strange bugs. They aren't game breaking, but quite annoying.			"

I still have had fun with this game tho, even alone. I would recommend it but it would be much much better if you bought the standalone version. 7/10			"

												This is a great mod especially if you get DayzCommander. The reason that I say this is because DayzCommander finds all versions of the game that is compatible with the current version that you have, plus it lets you download other mods for this game and not only that but it also lets you run dayz without having to launch steam (which is why my account says that I have played dayz for less than an hour when in reality i have been play for about three plus hours a day for about FIVE months). The main mod that I recommend is Epoch. What Epoch does is it gives more purpose to dayz by adding an economic system into the game. With this mod you can go all lone wolf or team up with a group to make a base and team up to do special missions on a server such as kill the bandits at a bandit stock pile and take the loot which might include an As50 tws and if your really lucky ammo for it. So far the server that I have found for the dayz mod that has been the best and most exciting is Blackhearts DayZ Epoch. This server usually fills up close to full most dayz and it almost always has admins on (you may not know it has an admin on at the time because some are unanounced admins that watch for hackers)			"

												Fantastic game, a very fun yet quite realistic simulation of an zombie apocalypse. There are many ways to play this game throughout its huge area, and both playing with friends or alone grants a exciting and addictive experience. PvP is also quite nice (if you don't mind being labeled as a bandit). By the way, I personally recommend playing this game through a great application called ""DayZ Commander"" it is a much greater server finder than the original one that you start through Arma II Operation Arrowhead.

												Wow! This game has serious potential! DayZ has to be one of the best games I have ever played. DayZ has the simple concept of surviving. You are dumped into a post apocalyptic world infested with zombies. This may sound simple, however, it is something that I just love. The DayZ worlds (yes there has been several different worlds created for DayZ) are just beautiful. They are massive and have an eerie stillness to it that makes you so immersed into the gameplay, thinking that you are actually in a zombie inhabited world fighting for survival. The fact of being in a world with other real players is amazing. Think this to yourself: how will you interact with them? Other players makes surviving a lot harder. This is the true difficulty of the game. What makes this game really interesting is that it is your choice. You choose what to do. You can choose to help people or kill everyone you meet. Ofcourse, with the game being in alpha, the are heaps of glitches... heaps. Zombies can attack you though walls, your cars can flip and shopping marts can be filled with floating loot! These are only some of the glitches to name. But these downsides hardly affect the game. Once you play it, you will understand.  DayZ is very versatile. Many mods for this mod have already been created which are great to suit your own playing style. If you like trading and building bases, DayZ Epoch is for you. If you like your game to be more difficult, DayZ 2017 will suit you. I really like DayZ. Hopefully these glitches and other faults will be fixed as it can make the game discouraging to play. This game is already a big hit now, and what awaits for it in the future is going to be grand. DayZ has yet to be one of the best games ever.			"

												Day Z has it's issues, it has it's flaws. Yes, many people play Day Z as Arma II with zombies, and not really as a zombie survival game. It's all about PvP and hunting other ""survivors"" than it is about the zombie survival. And yes, hacks are very common. Anyone that tells you otherwise has not played Day Z.All that being said, I have been playing Day Z on and off for a while now. And it can be a great experiance with the right people. So even with it's list of flaws, and lets be honest, all games have them, Day Z is still a great mod and there is a lot of fun to be had.It also pays to remember, it's still Arma in the respect that if you plan on just jumping in for a quick and easy zombie game, you're going to be very ... very ... disappointed. If you don't have time to dedicated to the experiance, and patience, or if you get upset easily when getting killed by other players for your loot, then you may want to move on to something else. Day Z is not for you.			"

												Harder to get into for people not familiar with the ArmA franchise and also harder to learn than the chastised WarZ(or Infestation, Survivor Stories as it has changed to).Definatley have to recomend http://www.dayzcommander.com/ for updates as Steam as been left behind in updates.By the way DayZcommander opens both OA and DAYZ at the same time and at this time I havent figured out how to rectified as of yet.All in all....a good pulse raiser even now.Cheers,Gio			"

												Incredibly Immersive. Horribly nerve-racking. You play until you die. And when you die, you kind of don't want to play again. Well, that didn't stop me! It's incredibly difficult to play alone since most travel in packs and the true enemy isn't the zombies. It's your fellow humans. And boy are they savages. They'll♥♥♥♥♥♥and pillage your group/camp if they even catch a whiff of a pistol magazine on you. If they see you ammo-less, begging for them to save you from a horde, they'll kill the zombies, then bludgeon you with a crowbar.Humans are vile creatures, and this game is the REAL outlet of our animalistic urges.Be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and play this game.

												So there I was, creeping through a small abandoned town just outside an Industrial village. Frantically searching houses for a gun, or maybe an axe. I could hear them coming closer and I still had nothing but bandages and a box of pain killers. I didn't look long, but it didn't take long before I knew it was time to get out of this town. No sooner do I start moving, I hear them growling. They're running for me now.I sprint into a small house and out the other side, jump a fence and stop in the shadow of a house. It was there that I found my first gun. A simple pistol with one mag. They're not chasing me anymore, I've lost them. It's time to leave the coast and head for the woods- At least this is what I had hoped I had done when a voice broke the silence. ""Hey buddy, you can put that gun down. You're coming with me."" Said the sniper, standing calmly in the wasteland. My day had just begun. My first day in Day Z.			"

												This game is amazing. It gives you hours of fun, and action, with in-depth exploration. You really don't need to say that much about it. Now when you start it you can only choose servers that run the mission 'DayZMod' not the one's like Epoch and such, which are mods with in a mod (*inception bawww*). While it gives you limited options with playing you can choose DayZ Launcher (Which is the new one since DayZ Commander went up and died on all of us), which has a LOT more servers you can play on, and you can install things like Epoch so you can play on those servers.This game really isn't for everyone because this game requires some patience. For example, it takes like 15 minutes to walk from Cherno to Elecktro (towns within the game). And on populated servers it can be a warzone on the coast (where you spawn), because bandits try to kill the fresh-spawns. But once you get past hours of walking, and avoiding bandits, its an awesome game. Good luck to you if you play! 9/10			"

												For the sake of people that don't know a lot about the game, I will start with the basic concepts and how the game goes. This game is like a zombie survival shooter where the zombies don't really matter at all. The thing you have to worry about is other people. Sure, the zombies can be a pain, but people shooting you in the face on sight is the bigger problem. The concept of the game is to try to survive as long as possible and either kill any bandits looting people, or become a bandit yourself. Loot on different servers varies a lot, so the survival aspect can be a breeze or a constant struggle for food and water.This game uses more realistic aspects than many shooters. The Dayz mod uses more realistic physics (besides the part where rocks send you flying), so this means bullets drop and can go through walls. Your aim is more difficult to keep steady after sprinting. That's right, you can't sprint a mile and no scope someone after stopping on the spot. When you get hurt, you have to bandage yourself and possibly use a bloodbag to keep from passing out. You can also hunt and gut animals to give the game a more survival feel. I have had Dayz for a while (I have more hours, they are just recorded on Arma2: Operation Arrowhead for some reason), and I can say that the game has a lot of replay value. I could probably play this game for hundreds of hours and not really get bored of it, which is something that I value a lot in a game. If you like first person shooters, you'd like Dayz. If you like third person shooters, you'd like Dayz. That's right, you can toggle between either view ingame. I really like this feature because the different views have their own advantages. There are also many different vehicles to choose from. Helicopters can be tricky to learn how to fly, but eventually you get the hang of it. I suggest binding your auto hover command to the spacebar (if you get the game and learn the basic controls you'll get what I'm talking about). There are of course tanks and armored vehicles to ride across the country -did I mention the maps are huge?!- and boats to zip across to the islands. If you happen to come across someone that is friendly, the game gets alot more fun. It's a lot better when you have people to watch your back and maybe even build a base with you.If you decide to get the game, I'll tell you how to have the most fun out of it. When you download the game off steam, you get the Vanilla version, which is the basic original mod that first came out. It's more oriented towards the survival aspect, and you don't get access to many of the weapons and vehicles you could get. To expand your gameplay options, you have to get the other mods, such as Epoch or Overpoch. I think the best thing to do is to get DayZ Launcher, which is what I did. Just get dayz Launcher and use that to download the other maps and mods, since steam does not have them. Personally, I played on Vanilly for a while first to get my bearings and then switched to playing Epoch. Epoch is basically the same thing as Vanilla with a banking system, tanks, improved base building, and better weapons. You can go out and buy things instead of searching for them, which can be quite handy. Epoch also allows you to build certain vehicles if you have the right parts. If you've ever heard of someone calling the game ""running simulator,"" just know that this feature fixes this.From what I've read from reviews, it's best to avoid the standalone version like the plague, so the mod is the next best thing. In fact, it's better! You get so much more content and a small fraction of the bugs and glitches. Even though the game is starting to get a little older, it still has a huge community, so it won't be dieing out any time soon. Even if you don't think you'd like the game, it would definitely be worth the buy if it goes on sale for an already low price to start with. Sure, it can be a little buggy sometimes, but none of the problems are even remotely game-breaking, so don't let that deter you from having fun with it.Overall, I think it is a great game and is definitely worth getting, if only to have in your library untouched till the end of time like most of the games people get*If it is unclear, to get the Mod, you have to buy Arma 2 and Arma2: Operation Arrowhead, so just buy them together in the package, then download both to your computer and then get the mod to play*			"

												While the game is still a thrill to play I have to point out one thing. The community can be a total d*ucheface. People claim they leave because of empty promises from rocket but truly they leave because everyone is as*holes. People will kill fresh spawns, people will hack and give you the best guns which ruins the whole point of finding loot, and people will curse you out for complaining about no loot. Most likely the response is ""you arent looking in the right places"". Lol Ive checked cherno, electro, balota, stary and north airfield. There is nothing bro. And then they will say you suck. A+ for community.Like I said the game is still fun but the community sucks. Almost as bad as counterstrike and cod. You know what? maybe worse because you have nothing to lose in those games except the match. so there it is dayz by far has the worst community			"

												When i first bought this game i thought it would be like any other survival game. After i downloaded Arma 2 i had to go out and buy Operation Arrowhead, but after that i loaded up the mod and thought to myself ""is everybody like Frankie on this game""? The first server i joined. i had no idea where i was. There was an airport with alot of gunshots coming from it. I tried my best to get a weapon but failed and settled with a can of beans, i wanted to get as far away from that airfield as quickly as possible, i came upon a real big city and met up with a person just like me, he and i were afraid of the times ahead. i finally got a crowbar. I made it to a red looking building and found a pistol. Though i had no ammo i had power over unarmed people. i made my way inland and got sniped :/ DayZ is life DayZ is love			"

												So people often say this is better than standalone version well i can tell you its all matter of personal preference in my opinion this is better because its first dayz ever. So i got used to it now but downside is you need all those games so much disk memory and gotta spend money on those games why not go with standalone?Well standalone is laggy, bad optimised and since they added new zombies its almost impassable to survive zombies are not to be afraid of because they are not scary they are fckn annoying!DayZ mod vs Standalone??In my case MOD!

												This game is amazing. It gives you hours of fun, and action, with in-depth exploration. You really don't need to say that much about it. Now when you start it you can only choose servers that run the mission 'DayZMod' not the one's like Epoch and such, which are mods with in a mod (*inception bawww*). While it gives you limited options with playing you can choose DayZ Launcher (Which is the new one since DayZ Commander went up and died on all of us), which has a LOT more servers you can play on, and you can install things like Epoch so you can play on those servers.This game really isn't for everyone because this game requires some patience. For example, it takes like 15 minutes to walk from Cherno to Elecktro (towns within the game). And on populated servers it can be a warzone on the coast (where you spawn), because bandits try to kill the fresh-spawns. But once you get past hours of walking, and avoiding bandits, its an awesome game. Good luck to you if you play! 9/10			"

												possibly the best mod for a game since TFC 1.6. Not for the casual gamer or the weak of heart.Welcome to chernarus, 225 km/sq of obsolete civilization splattered with the walking dead and exorcised of security.DayZ is a survival horror game taken to a new level, offering you the chance to pit your skills against the grim reality of a future gone wrong. Take on the world, lone wolf style and let your instincts guide you as you try and simply stay alive whilst trying to outwit the many bandits and survivors that have found a home amongst the chaos, or, Group up with fellow survivors, Build a sanctuary and begin to carve your own future out of the ruins OR or Wander the plains as a madmen, carrying your sniper rifle and seeking out all the orange sherbert left in existance. good, bad or mad, only the best will survive. Trying to detail the many features of this game or the ways in which you can play it would be boring, simply put if you want a true challenge, this game is for you. ++WARNING++THIS MOD WILL EAT YOUR CPU/MEMORY Make sure you understand your system and what is going to be required of it before you attempt to play / judge			"

												While the game is still a thrill to play I have to point out one thing. The community can be a total d*ucheface. People claim they leave because of empty promises from rocket but truly they leave because everyone is as*holes. People will kill fresh spawns, people will hack and give you the best guns which ruins the whole point of finding loot, and people will curse you out for complaining about no loot. Most likely the response is ""you arent looking in the right places"". Lol Ive checked cherno, electro, balota, stary and north airfield. There is nothing bro. And then they will say you suck. A+ for community.Like I said the game is still fun but the community sucks. Almost as bad as counterstrike and cod. You know what? maybe worse because you have nothing to lose in those games except the match. so there it is dayz by far has the worst community			"

												The DayZ ArmA 2 mod is a fantasic mod. But alas, every game isn't perfect. To run the mod to expectation DayZ Commander is highly recommended. But if you want to play on extra maps such as Epoch, or Panthera, you will need to install those from the Commander. The thing is, if this mod didn't require so many add-ons for itself, it would be a MILLION times better. Aside from that the gameplay is fun, and so is the overall realism that a good survival game should have. And if more players didn't kill anyone on sight, well.... that would be even better. FYI, look out for angry squeakers.			"

												Whatever you do, do not buy any ArmA 2 games just to get this mod. The game would be fine if there was a little more organization to what gets transfered from server to server. It's like you have to totally restart every time you log into a server, instead of being able to jump back in right where you left off. For instance, in one Epoch server I logged out on a rooftop with an inventory full of supplies and weapons. When the server was empty and I tried to log into a different Epoch server, I started off with whatever their default login inventory was and I was nowhere near where I logged off.The zombies in this game are freaking annoying as well. Sometimes they move normally, but that is rare. Most times they randomly jolt around and even glitch around which makes it impossible to use ammo sparingly. For some reason everybody says to just bring them inside a building because the devs felt it made sense to make them stop running when they are under a roof.. Makes no sense to me.5 out of 10 for me. The ideas they have in this game make it uber-realistic, up until your encounters with the problems that I stated earlier. There are more major issues than this, but if you're willing to buy this game after what I just explained, then your probably not going to be swayed.P.S.I am myself a game developer, currenltly working on a title. This should have some indication that I know a little bit about user experience and game design.			"

												This mod is just more than a mod it sparked the idea to make a standalone game. During the game, you could encounter a friendly and decide to let him pass or to take him out, you could face a clan and if you have a clan you could basically declare war on the other group. Personally, my friends and I used DayZ commander when the server interface from Arma 2 and OA are kind of hard to navigate. To start off, my friends and I had to meet each other which could take 5 minutes but at most taking the game seriously an hour and a half if you happen to spawn on the other side of the coast. After my friends and I met up we made our way to Elektrovoszak or as people in-game refer to it as Elektro there, we would loot the multiple industrial buldings and got basic supplies like crowbars and hatchets these would come into play when we would make our way to the neighboring town of Chernogorsk or Cherno again, there are many buildings you can loot, we found our first gun in one of the two firestations. After ransacking Cherno of most of it supplies i would recommend to go to Balota and the airstrip, there are two hangars multiple barracks, control tower and even a military medical camp where you could find bloodbags to get blood back or as some games refer too it as HP, you start off with 12000 and when your blood decreases your screen starts to become black and white, once your blood gets very low you will be knocked out and you will regain conciousnes after the sand timer goes to the bottom or even in some cases your buddy will have to give you an epi pen that will make you regain conciousnes. After you hit Balota Airfield you should make your way up north towards the NE and NW airfields which will give you military grade supplies but it is a huge risk when snipers have ghille suits and hide in the foliage and wait for an unexpecting victim to try to loot the high grades buildings next thing... BOOM your leg is broken and you will begin losing blood very quickly and you will have to start all over again. DayZ Mod gives you the chance to make risky decisons, you could be a bandit who shoots people on sight for no reason just to have fun or you could be DayZ's role modles as Heros, when you get enough supplies and you come across fresh spawns on the shore and give them food, water and protection. What will be your story? 4.5/5 Stars Pros- Pro players that will help you, freedom to make decisons, make new friends. Cons- At times buggy, servers full of bandits, graphic demanding. I would highly recomend this game to anyone that like RPG's but taking it to the next level with decisons that will affect you.			"

												This mod is like a game, Arma II is amazing also. DayZ is like a whole another game (even though its a mod) You take place as a lone survivor in the post apocolyptic world (I know I don't know how to spell xD) as you fight for your life scavenging the world for food water and anything too your survival. I would reccomend this game to anyone of age who likes those survival mmo's. This mod is way better than that other game that was recently removed from steam (no name). At it's current stage DayZ's zombies are really no threat and most players shoot on sight, when the standalone version comes out on steam this game is going to be even better. DayZ is filled with hackers so buy at your own risk. Hacking is for 12 year old kids who suck at the game ( YOU WILL BE BANNED, SO DONT EVEN TRY) I am not a moderator or anything but this has to be my favorite game of all time. I have never written this long of a reccomendation before so you know it's going to mean something :). Also if you don't take my word this game is currently a mod, and if any mod is on steam then you know it's going to be good. This is the first Zombie survival MMO the other title is not (no name mentioned, you know what I am talking about) is not the first. I am so glad that this game onto steam in just a mod stage that is how popular it is. Before hand I played a lot of steam games, Then in late april the ArmA II: DayZ mod comes out I think it's cool I get it and its amazing. Ever since I got this mod I stopped playing all my game this is the only game I have been playing since release! I hope you go out and put some money on ArmA II combined operations to play DayZ. I am just glad i typed this not having to write it. This game is amazing no doubt about it, JUST GET IT :)			"

												DayZ is a extremly detailed and atmospheric zombie survival simulator based on the Arma II engine.It's very enjoyable to play and organise yourself in a group of players to conquer numerous challenges,just like obtaining vehicles and bases or taking out other groups of survivors.Be sure to install the DayZ Commander and further modifications like Epoch or Origins because this Mod is definitelynot perfected and bugfree yet.

												This game has a lot of potential to be something great but the game mechanics are absolutely beyond horrible. Server connection problems and the fact that your player will randomly crouch without you commanding it makes the game even more annoying. The way your character moves is anything but smooth and it takes you a ridiculous amount of time to swim somewhere. I've glitch died several times by falling off of ladders and phasing through buildings where I would break a leg and slowly bleed to death. Zombies are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly overpowered. They will chase you and eventually catch you no matter what you do, and there are practically no weapons to kill them. I'm not one to give bad reviews but this game is an absolute pile of %^&#			"

												I cannot say enough good things about this game. I have been playing it eveyday for over the past two months. I found this game at a time when I was totally fed up with zombie games, but I stumbled across this games, and I fell in love. If you are into survival games, this is the game for you. It has a great feel of realisim, along with great gameplay. Dealing with other players always keeps you on your toes. You never know if they are your friend, or lureing you into a trap to steal your hard earned goods. All-in-all, it is a great game, and worth playing even if you are not into the genre.			"

I tried my best to get a weapon but failed and settled with a can of beans, i wanted to get as far away from that airfield as quickly as possible, i came upon a real big city and met up with a person just like me, he and i were afraid of the times ahead. i finally got a crowbar.

												If you are debating on buying either this or the standalone of DayZ i highly recommend that you buy Arma 2 and Arma 2 OA to play this game. Seeing as the cost for the Arma bundle is less than the standalone itself you are getting a pretty good deal. Not saying that this the standalonne isnt good, but this game has alot of different kinds of DayZ like Epoch, Overwatch, Namalisk, Panthera, and many more. If you do buy the arma bundle to play this you must download DayZ Commander or other similar launchers so that you can get the most out of it. DayZ in general 10/10			"

												Fantastic concept, unfortunately poorly executed, the ARMA 2 engine looks fantastic but plays like a dog turd.There are so many problems with the DAYZ mod it's unbelievable and now the standalone is out none of them will be fixed and it will fade away. I only hope the standalone with the ARMA 3 engine is a lot better than this as in my opinion with all the DAYZ mods faults its simply not worth the bother playing.On the other hand if it is easier to play with smoothed out control system, then DAYZ standalone will be a hell of a game.

												I love to play zombie games as well as watching TV series, films and stuff. So once I saw this game (DayZ a zombie game of some kind) I bought ArmA II folowed by Operation Arrowhead, because you need those games to play. Let's draw a conclusion - this game (mod) is not completely free. What is more frustrating, I spend from 2 to 3 hours searching for information how to I start it, because it has so much freaking bugs, like being a bird when you spawn/respawn, wrong patch/you can't play in many many servers, or even invalid cd key. But when I fix it all, spend a lot of my free time doing what is not belong to a players to do (I mean if there is a game on steam, it has to be completely (almost) finished so that players could play with no problem) a lot of freaking freaky bugs appeared while playing, like FPS drop when zombies are chasing you, zombie goes trough walls, doors, etc., mysterious heart attack even if you got full HP and a lot more. I am okay if games has got bugs, but when you loose all of your stuff and start over and over and over and over again it gets anoying and boring. So for you guys, I recommend DayZ Standalone, even though it's has a fair price on it and it's still on alpha that's the game you should play. Dont waste your time and more importantly your money (ARMAII,ARROWHEAD) on this one, believe it.			"

												For the sake of people that don't know a lot about the game, I will start with the basic concepts and how the game goes. This game is like a zombie survival shooter where the zombies don't really matter at all. The thing you have to worry about is other people. Sure, the zombies can be a pain, but people shooting you in the face on sight is the bigger problem. The concept of the game is to try to survive as long as possible and either kill any bandits looting people, or become a bandit yourself. Loot on different servers varies a lot, so the survival aspect can be a breeze or a constant struggle for food and water.This game uses more realistic aspects than many shooters. The Dayz mod uses more realistic physics (besides the part where rocks send you flying), so this means bullets drop and can go through walls. Your aim is more difficult to keep steady after sprinting. That's right, you can't sprint a mile and no scope someone after stopping on the spot. When you get hurt, you have to bandage yourself and possibly use a bloodbag to keep from passing out. You can also hunt and gut animals to give the game a more survival feel. I have had Dayz for a while (I have more hours, they are just recorded on Arma2: Operation Arrowhead for some reason), and I can say that the game has a lot of replay value. I could probably play this game for hundreds of hours and not really get bored of it, which is something that I value a lot in a game. If you like first person shooters, you'd like Dayz. If you like third person shooters, you'd like Dayz. That's right, you can toggle between either view ingame. I really like this feature because the different views have their own advantages. There are also many different vehicles to choose from. Helicopters can be tricky to learn how to fly, but eventually you get the hang of it. I suggest binding your auto hover command to the spacebar (if you get the game and learn the basic controls you'll get what I'm talking about). There are of course tanks and armored vehicles to ride across the country -did I mention the maps are huge?!- and boats to zip across to the islands. If you happen to come across someone that is friendly, the game gets alot more fun. It's a lot better when you have people to watch your back and maybe even build a base with you.If you decide to get the game, I'll tell you how to have the most fun out of it. When you download the game off steam, you get the Vanilla version, which is the basic original mod that first came out. It's more oriented towards the survival aspect, and you don't get access to many of the weapons and vehicles you could get. To expand your gameplay options, you have to get the other mods, such as Epoch or Overpoch. I think the best thing to do is to get DayZ Launcher, which is what I did. Just get dayz Launcher and use that to download the other maps and mods, since steam does not have them. Personally, I played on Vanilly for a while first to get my bearings and then switched to playing Epoch. Epoch is basically the same thing as Vanilla with a banking system, tanks, improved base building, and better weapons. You can go out and buy things instead of searching for them, which can be quite handy. Epoch also allows you to build certain vehicles if you have the right parts. If you've ever heard of someone calling the game ""running simulator,"" just know that this feature fixes this.From what I've read from reviews, it's best to avoid the standalone version like the plague, so the mod is the next best thing. In fact, it's better! You get so much more content and a small fraction of the bugs and glitches. Even though the game is starting to get a little older, it still has a huge community, so it won't be dieing out any time soon. Even if you don't think you'd like the game, it would definitely be worth the buy if it goes on sale for an already low price to start with. Sure, it can be a little buggy sometimes, but none of the problems are even remotely game-breaking, so don't let that deter you from having fun with it.Overall, I think it is a great game and is definitely worth getting, if only to have in your library untouched till the end of time like most of the games people get*If it is unclear, to get the Mod, you have to buy Arma 2 and Arma2: Operation Arrowhead, so just buy them together in the package, then download both to your computer and then get the mod to play*			"

												So there I was, creeping through a small abandoned town just outside an Industrial village. Frantically searching houses for a gun, or maybe an axe. I could hear them coming closer and I still had nothing but bandages and a box of pain killers. I didn't look long, but it didn't take long before I knew it was time to get out of this town. No sooner do I start moving, I hear them growling. They're running for me now.I sprint into a small house and out the other side, jump a fence and stop in the shadow of a house. It was there that I found my first gun. A simple pistol with one mag. They're not chasing me anymore, I've lost them. It's time to leave the coast and head for the woods- At least this is what I had hoped I had done when a voice broke the silence. ""Hey buddy, you can put that gun down. You're coming with me."" Said the sniper, standing calmly in the wasteland. My day had just begun. My first day in Day Z.			"

												This mod is like a game, Arma II is amazing also. DayZ is like a whole another game (even though its a mod) You take place as a lone survivor in the post apocolyptic world (I know I don't know how to spell xD) as you fight for your life scavenging the world for food water and anything too your survival. I would reccomend this game to anyone of age who likes those survival mmo's. This mod is way better than that other game that was recently removed from steam (no name). At it's current stage DayZ's zombies are really no threat and most players shoot on sight, when the standalone version comes out on steam this game is going to be even better. DayZ is filled with hackers so buy at your own risk. Hacking is for 12 year old kids who suck at the game ( YOU WILL BE BANNED, SO DONT EVEN TRY) I am not a moderator or anything but this has to be my favorite game of all time. I have never written this long of a reccomendation before so you know it's going to mean something :). Also if you don't take my word this game is currently a mod, and if any mod is on steam then you know it's going to be good. This is the first Zombie survival MMO the other title is not (no name mentioned, you know what I am talking about) is not the first. I am so glad that this game onto steam in just a mod stage that is how popular it is. Before hand I played a lot of steam games, Then in late april the ArmA II: DayZ mod comes out I think it's cool I get it and its amazing. Ever since I got this mod I stopped playing all my game this is the only game I have been playing since release! I hope you go out and put some money on ArmA II combined operations to play DayZ. I am just glad i typed this not having to write it. This game is amazing no doubt about it, JUST GET IT :)			"

												Day Z has it's issues, it has it's flaws. Yes, many people play Day Z as Arma II with zombies, and not really as a zombie survival game. It's all about PvP and hunting other ""survivors"" than it is about the zombie survival. And yes, hacks are very common. Anyone that tells you otherwise has not played Day Z.All that being said, I have been playing Day Z on and off for a while now. And it can be a great experiance with the right people. So even with it's list of flaws, and lets be honest, all games have them, Day Z is still a great mod and there is a lot of fun to be had.It also pays to remember, it's still Arma in the respect that if you plan on just jumping in for a quick and easy zombie game, you're going to be very ... very ... disappointed. If you don't have time to dedicated to the experiance, and patience, or if you get upset easily when getting killed by other players for your loot, then you may want to move on to something else. Day Z is not for you.			"

												Harder to get into for people not familiar with the ArmA franchise and also harder to learn than the chastised WarZ(or Infestation, Survivor Stories as it has changed to).Definatley have to recomend http://www.dayzcommander.com/ for updates as Steam as been left behind in updates.By the way DayZcommander opens both OA and DAYZ at the same time and at this time I havent figured out how to rectified as of yet.All in all....a good pulse raiser even now.Cheers,Gio			"

												Incredibly Immersive. Horribly nerve-racking. You play until you die. And when you die, you kind of don't want to play again. Well, that didn't stop me! It's incredibly difficult to play alone since most travel in packs and the true enemy isn't the zombies. It's your fellow humans. And boy are they savages. They'll♥♥♥♥♥♥and pillage your group/camp if they even catch a whiff of a pistol magazine on you. If they see you ammo-less, begging for them to save you from a horde, they'll kill the zombies, then bludgeon you with a crowbar.Humans are vile creatures, and this game is the REAL outlet of our animalistic urges.Be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and play this game.

Build you a camp with tents in it. And fights the zombies and the other players who wanna steal your stuff. The only thing they could change: make the zombie stronger and harder, and change the cities ( the buildings are just small cabins)			"

												The game on regular servers pretty much became counter-strike or any other regular fps with an occasional zombie glitched inside. it's really hard to learn how to survive. BUT there are different servers like DayZRP where people talk first and only then resort to hostilities. In servers like these the undeniable beauty of DayZ resurfaces as you, a new survivor, must embrace a path of a hero and help people, or follow a darker path and explore the devastated country of Chernarus as a bandit. From my gaming experience, DayZ is hands down the best game I have ever played and the most I enjoyed. When I play alone in the dark I feel like im in a mixture of the movie Matrix and a zombie apocalipse for there exists another world which you can explore, other people that you will meet and tough choices you will be forced to make. Even if its to avoid Chernogorsk even if your friend needs help, or kill your allie for a can of beans, because you're starving.Definetely recommend this game. Got it, played it, loved it, still into it. 10/10			"

												82 minutes in game and only actually getting to play about 20 of that, the multiplayer serer selection setup is the main issue, would be a nice feature if they added a history section but its a pain in♥♥♥♥♥to go through ea server and see if your version of DayZ is the correct one as well as do you have the extra mods like epoch (must have since majority of servers run it). its frustrating but i still want to play, those 20 minutes i did play were fun though made a mistake and dropped my flashlight in the first minute at night trying to equip my gun which i apparently started out with equiped. the fact there are so many controls in this game kinda makes it irrtating trying to get everything set up properly for myself. not a elite gamer, but i am slightly more advanced than average so handling a game with so much gets a little overwhelming, this game was not made for the average gamer, that being said, It's an amazing game, it can even make the average gamer into something more if they are willing to hold out.

If you slow down EVEN A WEE BIT YOU WILL PROBABLY DIE HORRIBLY.Players and yourself ARE HUGE threats more so than zeds you need to eat drink and not bleed out,BUT so do others and they will take your head off. And a word of advise NEVER under any curicemstances TRUST anyone but hero's. beacuse you might have that can they need to not die. ""In the end we all bleed the same""			"

												まさにゾンビサバイバルを体感できるMOD。プレイヤーは満足な装備を持たずしていきなり広大なMAPに投げ出されますそこはゾンビの闊歩する無法地帯。生き残るには食料や武器が必要になりますゾンビの視線をかいくぐりやっとのことで物資を手に入れられても、今度は別のプレイヤーに出会うことでしょうあなたのコンタクト次第ですが、物資を分け合ったり協力し合って生き残ることもできますし、ほかのプレイヤーを殺して物資を奪ってもいいのです　まさに無法地帯です物資以外にも、修理可能な車両や航空機があったりするので、そいつを直せば広大なマップを縦横無尽に走り回ることもできます高い自由度とサバイバル感を味わえる作品ですArma2持っててゾンビサバイバルを体感したい人なら是非ともやってみてください			"

												Pretty much about survival and less about zombie fps'ing. You need to salvage material to fix or build equipment which will further secure you and any allies. Your real problem is other players who are out to take these things from you by force or deceit. The maps are beautiful...and there is weather and day/night cycles. Sure, the standalone is coming out soon but this is still a worthwhile mod.			"

												The Dayz Mod and the Standalone DayZ, are very poor, bugs, bad servers, functions fail to work, such as, Exit a mission, or Respawn.  Also, most of the time, you spawn in as a bird in Dayz....IE: your dead before you load in.  The controls are completely insane!!! lets just say, OVER programmed.... It is so complicated to use the controls...The most common control are accually menu functions, so you end up, going to some menu for color shading instead of aiming, or arming a weapon.  I would have to say, as a whole... this game gets a 40% grade....Failing Grade.   The other game such as Arma2 and expansions, are just as barbaric.    Rememebr game in the late 90's...such as, Rouge Spear?   This game is even worse...sry Steam.....But your games are big piles of crap, and your the Steam from it all.			"

												A Recently bought this game when it was just $6 during a sale and after a few hours it became my favorite game its all i ever wanted in a game survival,multiplayer,zombies,guns and do whatever you want this game is great! you should get it but only problem is that if you buy operation arrow head and arma 2 by itself theres like barely any server that you can join so it kinda forces you to buy the complete collection this game is great just wish more people made vanilla dayz without all the expansion packs.

												The consequence-free nature of internet gaming makes this a terrible, terrible way to spend your time if you don't have a lot of it. If you do, however, have plenty of time to waste, it'll deliver thrills and chills like no other zombie game, particularly of the kind where you run up to fellow players, carefully negotiate a truce with them, accidentally fire your gun, and then get shot by fifteen dudes who all go crazy shooting one another. It's not the zombies that'll get ya. It's the guy who hacks the game so the entire country of Thirdworldistan blows up.			"
