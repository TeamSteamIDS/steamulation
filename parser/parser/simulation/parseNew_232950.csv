												This game is a mess.The physic are mostly wrong, especially when it comes to statics and dynamic of complex structures. The materials behave wrong, so there is no buckling of long thin steel, instead you see steel cables break from tension first.Sometimes if you span a cable between two bearings (no load) it changes the behavior of your design (although this is mathematically not possible). Even better: when applying wind force on the described cable it broke! (This sounds like a bad joke but you can try it yourself)The guy that made the algorythm has no no idea about structual calculations and/or the game designer didn't have common sense in noticing that there are GAMEBREAKING bugs in the simulation.When you have to build suspension bridges, the experience is the worst (refer to the cable above), as they in general behave unbelieveable random and unrealistc - many levels you can just finish with try-retry and error and not with your knowledge about structual engineering.At the same point this brings the only challenge you have, as the levels are boring and uninspired.It happens regulary that your bridge collapses in one test and then you delete a part, rebuild the same part and suddenly it works. This brings us to the only good point of the game. Bridge collapse spectacular- what happens often randomly. Ultimatly the unprecise  (especially if you want to delete something) slow controls (icons spread over the whole screen) what makes retrying more frustrating than it should be. I tried to give this game a chance, because i actually work as civil engineer - but i really got disappointed by the fake realism.			"

												I really enjoy bridge simulator games, but this is the worst one that I've played. There is no consistency in how materials behave, the interface is infuriating, and rather than being fun to play, I find it a tedious chore.Many levels have identical setups; however, a bridge that just worked on one behaves completely differently on the other. The first will have zero stress while at rest and easily handles the traffic while the second will have red on all joints and will fail the instant any traffic touches it. The game shows no reason for this change in behavior. It simply is the way things work.As for the interface, it is very difficult to edit a bridge. This results in my rebuilding the bridge from scratch each time or just using undo until it removes the part I want removed and beginning again from that point. The reason for this is that I can right-click a piece to remove it, but it doesn't remove the entire section that was added, just a portion of it. If I place down two sections to brace the bridge, I need to right click and remove around 10 different segments to remove those two sections. There is the ability to draw a box around sections to highlight them and them remove them, but many times, the cursor will change to indicate that it is select mode yet will still add new sections, making it difficult to use that tool. Even when the select tool works, it removes too much as it will remove joint placement points for remaining sections, making them unusable.I tried to like this game, but the flaws show me that this is simply a ""us too"" bridge simulator and not one made to be a quality and enjoyable game.

												""This bridge falls apart rather quickly""Steam is starting to build up a collection of bridge building games for users interested in them, with Bridge It, Bridge Constructor and Bridge Project to pick from. It  took me a while to get this title, but I ended up getting this for a dollar from the Humble Bundle site during a Weekly sale. I'm beginning to feel I paid too much for the game. StoryNo story to this, you are just some random idiot building bridges that can't support the weight of a feather. Why do they keep giving me this job?PresentationThe game looks nice for a bridge building title, but seems it isn't optimized as well as other titles, with me having to reduce graphics settings rather than leaving everything maxed. It does at least have different cars crossing the bridge, rather than several identical vehicles. The game has a few basic tunes to listen to as you put together the monstrosity you call a bridge, along with different sound effects for the various vehicles, placing pieces and even a victory fanfare for completing a level. ControlsNot quite as good as the other games mentioned at the start of the review. Placing pieces works, but the pointer is inaccurate. You might have it aimed at a certain point, but the piece will be aiming at a different section of the layout grid. This really needs some work. Removing pieces is also an annoyance. You need to right click a piece to bring up a menu to remove pieces. Which would be fine, if it responded as it should. The inaccurate aim seems to affect this as well, meaning you may need to repeat the action several times. GameplayAlright, outside of the problems that the controls will cause, jut how fun is this game? Well, its alright. You lay down some pieces, send the vehicles across, watch it fail, then repeat until it works. You might notice I didn't mention a need to edit the bridge. Well, this game has some wonky physics. Just because the bridge didn't work the first time doesn't mean it won't the second time. Don't worry too much about building a perfect bridge, that failure still has a chance. Also, if you have an impressive failure, take screen shots now. I missed out my own chance because of the physics. This game is starting to look pretty poor, but don't worry, it isn't all bad news. One thing it has over the other titles is what you can throw at your bridge. Think you have built a real sturdy beast of a bridge? Send out the tanks! That will crush it in moments. There is cars, buses, trains, tanks, earthquakes, high speed winds and the occasional boat if you are doing the right level. LifespanThis game has 4 different level sets, those being Rural, Cities, Canyons and Varied. Each set has 12 levels to figure out. Its not too bad, the later levels will have you working hard to find a solution that doesn't collapse. It also has a limited level construction tool so you can make your own levels to share on Steam. Lastly, there are a small number of achievements, related to game progress for the most part, with only one being a weird challenge. Constructor has much more interesting achievements if you care about these. After spending some time on this game, I'm going to have to say this is the worst of the three bridge building games. While it has the most vehicle options and even custom levels, the flaws of the game prevent it from being as good as Bridge It, or even the much cheaper Bridge Constructor. Save your cash and wait for one of the other two to hit a sale or bundle.3 / 10			"

												Is Bridge Project flawed?  Yes.Is it worth full price? No.Is it entertaining?  Yes.I got this little guy in a Humble Bundle, and while there's not a lot to it, it's fun enough to keep me amused.  I'm having a good time completing bridges and then trimming back my design as much as possible to beat levels with minimal material usage.  If you like to fiddle around with things relentlessly, this will be fun.  The physics are definitely wonky, and results with the exact same bridge are not always the same. Also, the designer is inconsistent in its functionality.  But again, those problems can be overlooked if you like putting things together and tweaking them.			"

												Got it from Humble Bundle and enjoyed a few hours of it. It's graphically polished however the physics (the main gamplay element for a bridge building game) are flawed.Symmetrical bridges will have massive stress on one side and no stress on the other even with no load. The tension physics for cables are flawed to the point where they will randomly decide to increase in length and then cause your bridge to fail.The high scores and steam workshop integration has yet to work which is a shame because it is required for an achievement.The level design is good with a small amount of variety, pistons add a nice speedbump to the game but when coupled with the poor physics they can cause perfectly good bridges to collapse for no reason.Considering I got it for almost nothing off Humble Bundle it's not too bad but I can't say it's worth anything near the store price.

												This game makes me cry a little inside everytime I see it defying physics or not simulating materials the same way everytime.This game is fun, but, seriously some bridges are just non sense.  When you build a bridge meant for cars you don't expect a 100 ton train to cross it suddenly.  The draw bridges are also TERRIBLE.  Everytime the bridge ""draws"" it always breaks somewhere.			"

												A dissappointment. I have played bridge simulator games since the original Bridge Builder and I can say that there were some major design flaws particularly in controls, but you can overcome that; and there are a lot of bugs/inconsistencies, at least compared to older games like ""Bridge It!"".I really hope that developers will improve the game experience, but until then this game cannot be compared to Bridge Builder and Pontifex, since it's obviously in their genre. The only thing that is good in that case is graphics, but in my experience ""Bridge It!"" looked much nicer. "

												Very disappointing.The physics engine is really poor -- the materials don't bend or buckle, they only fail at joints.   The UI is poor -- you can't move  joints, connections aren't always made properly (so the roadway just falls through the bridge), and sometimes a member is under great stress for no reason.   There's no data provided on the materials, and the stress feedback only shows some form of accumulated stress -- no directions, no % remaining.In short, this is a puzzle game, not an engineering game.

												Early nominee for worst game of 2013. Nice to see it's not just Aliens: Colonial Marines that sucked complete and utter balls. Ultimately this is another example of a good concept, poorly executed. You might surmise (from the awesome looking screenshot) that you would be building epic bridges spanning huge chasms with a wealth of materials at your disposal so you can build a bridge your way. No. What you actually get is a series of extremely similar small levels that require you to build a bridge out of the limited materials given (pretty much ruining any hopes you might have for grand designs). The controls are flawed and the similarity of the levels and the crappy physics engine mean 9 times out of 10 the correct solution to finish the level is to build the exact same ♥♥♥♥ing bridge, varied only by the material used in its construction and whether most of the support goes on the left or the right hand side. It's stale, boring and unimaginative when it could easily have been so much more. In other words, a typical German simulator cobbled together for the bargain bins of the world's game stores.			"

												Probably not worth the full $20 price tag, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Watching the city buses smash into one another as the bridges fell apart was always worth a chuckle.In simple construction mode it's possible to beat every mission in a single sitting (if you can dedicate most of a day off to that sort of thing).  This isn't a game you'll really go back to more than once or twice.The user interface could also use a little work.  Sometimes you end up building pieces that don't quite touch and immediately fall apart once you start the simulation.  It's workable, but not great.There's also one achievement that I think may be impossible in the game's current state.  The way a lot of people are achieving Wood Bridge Master is with a glitch.  I spent over an hour trying every design I could think of to no avail, but I never entered advanced construction mode either.  It may be possible, but I seriously doubt it.As one reviewer noted, each simulation can yield different results.  If you get really close and don't want to redesign anything, you might be able to complete it by trying the simulation a few times.  I once had a bridge pass even though it was hanging by a thread after the final train went over it.			"

												Regardless of my non-recommendation I will say that this game was pretty addicting and had me playing it here and there for a couple weeks. If you can get it in a sale (I got it for $1 with the humble bundle) I would say ""maybe"" especially if you once went to a school which had West Point Bridge Designer installed on their computers.Pros:-Somewhat addicting time-killer for awhile.-Nostalgia for those who played bridge simulators in elementary/middle school.-Pretty good graphics for a bridge builder gameCons:-Physics that often make no sense and enrage you.-NOTHING is ever explained to you and there is NO documentation or FAQ. Be prepared to tinker in frustration or search youtube at times.-You can make a custom map with a lot of material available, but no real ""sandbox"" mode.			"

												Horrible.Stress on each piece varies per edit/simulate without changing a thing. As well as swtiching from showing stress to not, then back. Road pieces will detach from supports just by a vehicle driving over it. Bridge fails on ship test even though ship makes it under without hitting anything. Piston mechanics are terrible. There is no clear way on how to use them or how they work. What you think would work, just breaks all kinds of pieces. When lowering back into place the joints don't line up and reconnect.Not worth the money, Bundle or not.			"

												Forgive me for being picky, but I believe a game that is ONLY about physics problems (building bridges) should have a realistic physics engine. The materials in this game behave well during the really basic bridges, but the more complex bridges show how feeble the engine gets. Even simple truss structures don't behave properly. I always liked building bridges as a kid, but this ""simulation"" is less accurate than my old toothpick creations.			"

												A pretty addictive bridge builder with a bit too many flaws that the developers have had more than enough time to sort out.The actual levels are just about what you expect in most respects, including difficulty.The early levels are very simple and just put in the game for people who are new to bridge builders to get a hang of it.The levels after that start to get a bit harder, but far from actually being hard.Then once you pass that starting barrier you start getting to the point where you find out if this game really is for you, are you smart enough to figure out each level etc...Is bridge building games even for you?One of the flaws in this game for me is the UI. It's quite clunky and I really don't understand how the UI and building process wasn't cleaned up before this game was released.A huge negative but after playing for an hour or 2 you will get used to it.But, the biggest flaw of all is the physics and inconsistency of this game.Objects and such seem to change behaviour after each level.To put it simply; if you do a thing on level A it might work perfectly but doing the same exact thing might just instantly make the bridge fall apart on level B.Also, when you 'start' the level to see if your bridge can handle the task at hand it very often breaks or stuff fall off...To be honest this game is addictive, as I said, but it has too many flaws and a terrible UI for me to recommend it, especially considering how much it costs.

												I've had Bridge Project for a very long time, although for many reasons my gameplay time within the game is not very high.I have to say that this is one of the most annoying Bridge Builder games I've ever played. The largest flaw out of all of them is the physics. They are completely unrealistic (Despite seeing ""Realistic physics"" in the trailer for the game as I write this review) and you run into many problems such as bridges not closing properly, different stresses on symetrical bridges and many other issues.To top this all off and it should not be as a big surprise to many, the developers have been extremely lazy with this game. There hasn't been any attempt to resolve these issues after over 3 years and as you can see, they are using the game as a cash cow (NO game of this dire quality should be priced at £16 quid!).I'd not recommend buying it. Go and buy the good old Pontifex! It may be old but it's excellent compared to this.			"

												This game blows big time. Control of the contruction process is very unfriendly and not fun at all. Most of the time, the game does not respond to what you are telling it to do. For example, if you want to delete a bridge deck, you do not hover your mouse on the bridge deck but a square away from the bridge deck. Then when you right click to delete, nothing happens. So you try, and try again, then finally the delete option comes up.Biggest waste of $10 I have ever spent. I will never spend another dime on this developer.

												First time I encountered a bridge building game was back in the time when Pontifex and later Bridge Construction Set came out. Messing with physics was intriguing even though the game stressed out my old hardware beyond its limits. Looong did I hope that a modern version of such game would appear and there Bridge Project hit the target. After all, it's the same developer. They've gone up with the size from 32 MB (Pontifex) to 511 MB (Bridge Project). New maps to play, more decent graphics, perhaps a bit more casual feel to it but still, the essense is there.The basic interface is simple. Select the material to use, click on a joint and draw the piece where you want it to be. Simple mode helps you out quite a lot adding blocks, mirroring blocks and adding cross beams to support the structure. You can get far with it and be happy to see how the vehicles cross your newly built bridge.However, the most facinating part of the game is to scrap the simple mode and go expert. How far can you strip down the bridge and make it withstand the stress from the vehicles without it falling apart? To build a bridge with least number of elements, as light as possible, and with lowest budget is where you compete with yourself and globally with other players. The game has in-built global leaderboards where you can check out how well the best ones have done it.And this is where the interface gets in the way of the fun. You use the mouse to control pretty much everything (in addition to some keyboard shortcut keys). The left mouse button is for selecting and building, the middle button lets you dolly the camera, zoom works with mouse scroll, and the right button is for turning the camera and selecting the items for deletion.Unfortunately the last one simply doesn't seem to have any logic to it. The mouse pointer, humangous arrow, seems to be little off at all times. And despite of which item is highlighted on screen when mouse pointer is on it, the right click either selects another item or it simply turns the camera! Why?!? Why can't I select an item with LMB and then hit delete key from keyboard? That's how every other software works. No, here you need to find a specific spot of an item somewhere and then right click on it and select delete option. More often than not I was unable to find the correct spot and I ended up restarting the map instead. The cables seemed to be the worst. Using the separate select mode makes selection much easier and then even the delete key works. But why is it a separate mode? Fortunately space bar is the shortcut.The game is fun and it'll keep me playing it trying to best myself over and over again. If you're into semi-realistic physics simulation and construction then you probably will like the game. However, if you're easily irritated by cloggy interface then I'd recommend testing the game before purchase. Chronic Logic offers a free demo on their website with limited number of maps to try it out.			"

												Its half decent. Got it from a humble bundle. Its not worth $20, more like <$5.2hrs in and its very repetitive once you know what designs work as the physics are not fully correct and they can be manipulated to fit within the requirements of the game.Still its a fun way to kill off some spare time and experiment on your wacky bridge design idea's.Get it on a decent sale, if your the creative type.

												If you’re into building and testing your creations in a real world simulation then this is the game for you. This is a fun game to play when you’re bored or have some spare time and is more in depth and realistic than the free flash games. The first levels are easy and help teach basic controls but the later levels will offer difficulty and will challenge you. The only bad part is the game never really teaches you all the controls and it takes a while to learn how to use some of the more advanced one which you need to beat later levels which can cause frustration			"

												The idea of building bridges and seeing how well they do under scrutiny is solid in concept, as proven by the myriad other bridge games on Steam. This one, however, is a complete dud. This game lacks any polish or depth whatsoever. Every asset in this game is completely stock, from the creaking of the bridges to the fake cheering played whenever you complete a hideously easy level. The physics are complete wank, and some of the building materials are weird to get the hang of. I attempted to use suspension cables on a bridge only to have it immediately collapse, at which point I just used regular old wood and beat the level just fine. Steer clear of this, even when it's on sale and especially at full price. Go instead for literally any other bridge game on the market.			"

												Curator Review:Bridge Project is a building simulation-puzzle style game where you take the role of an architect tasked with building the cheapest bridge possible. Subject your bridge to the tests required and if it succeeds, you win! Sounds easy right? WRONG. This game poses a formidable challenge for those architecturally ignorant. Even if you know a great deal about architecture, the physics engine will stop you in your tracks. With inconsistent performances you never know if your bridge will really work. That being said, Bridge Project is still a good time and does a good job of being a fun game. The ambient music does not get repetitive easily and there are enough puzzles to keep a person busy for several hours. Pick it up if you enjoy puzzle games that require a building aspect, but only on sale. 7/10

This is a game where you spend your time trying to build designs that would work not in the real world, but only in the strange bizarro world of Bridge Project physics. If you do try to build bridges based on real-world classic designs, they will likely-as-not explode apart as soon as you build them.			"

												I'm not sure what happened. When I first got this game, I was fairly successful at building bridges that held. A few weeks ago I had to reinstall it, because I got a new computer, and now when I play my bridges almost always fail. Same basic designs from when I played before, but this time none of them work. Then there are the times when the bridge will just *fall apart without reason*. This game has some serious physics flaws, and what's worse is that there are no truly correct setups as one may work for one level, and fail utterly the next level, even with conditions being exactly the same. This game needs some serious polish. I can't recommend it.			"

												Short version of the review is save your money, and play cargo bridge 1 &2. Longer version: This is not a bridge building simulation, but rather a game. It doesn't take any real engineering knowlege to get through the levels, or at least not anything you can't look up easily. The game is ok, and feels like something I'd play on my tablet in between classes to kill time. It has no tutorial, and no manual leaving you to figure out things for yourself which is fine most of the time, except when it comes to one or two things like using pistons. Figuring out those can be frustrating. The most irritatiing part of the game is when the materials are so restricted that it forces you to play ""what was the level designer thinking"" instead of what would actually be the best solution. If the price dropped to 1 dollar I'd recommend it, if you're into games like this. Otherwise forget it.			"

												I bought this game only because it was at 75% discount. Even so I think I paid a bit too much. Got it all finished in 7 hours, including a lot of frustration from weird material behavior. This is especially visible in suspension bridges. I was dreading each mission where I could see suspension cables in the materials.If physics worked OK, I would say it would be worth the 5 euro I paid. As it is now it definitely doesn't deserve the 20 euro asked. Buy it only if you are a fanatic and only on sale.			"

												First of all the game doesn't have good controls. It's difficult to place pieces and impossible to remove them without removing half your bridge. There's a grid to which the mouse loosely snaps to, which is inaccurate and just makes placing pieces where you want stupidly hard.The graphics aren't very good either, the whole game looks like something from 2008, but I wouldn't mind the graphics if the rest of the game was good.And here's the main problem with the game - the physics are inconsistent in the test mode. Example: on the first test of my bridge, a cable breaks. I go back to the edit mode and test again without changing anything, then a completely different cable breaks! It also shows different stress in each piece of the bridge EVERY time! This is completely inexcuseable in a game based on physics.I got this game on Humblebundle for a dollar and I still don't think it was worth it. There is absolutely no way I can recommend ANYONE to buy this for the price it is on Steam, when there are way better bridge building games out there (go play some of the free flash games instead)!

												Okay, so I wasn't really expecting this game to be really great when I got it. It was originally $20, but was on a 66% sale. I decided that I'd get it. It might be an entertaining puzzle game. Long answer short: it wasn't.It isn't very entertaining. I mean, I guess it is what it says it is, but there isn't enough to it. There should be more creativity and imagination involved. There really isn't any. I was hoping that I would be able to build these large fancy bridges, but you only make simple ones.The look of this game is only okay. The graphics look quite dated. It's not terrible, but it certainly isn't good. I'm also disappointed that it wasn't more entertaining to watch your bridge break. Instead, the pieces just detach and fall. There's no breaking apart, splintering, cracking, or whatever. All things considered, rather boring.The controls are not the greatest either. Placing pieces is not very smooth. It feels like I'm playing an old game. Also, deleting a single piece is a pain. You right-click the piece to bring up the options for that piece (including deleting it), but most of the time, that menu doesn't show up.My final complaint is the sound. First of all, the soundtrack sucks. I turned it off soon after I started the game. As for the other in-game sound, it sounds like I'm playing a game that's 20 years old. I'm not a game designer, but I'm pretty sure it is not that hard to have higher quality sounds for a game like this (which essentially consist of bridge-breaking noises, car horns, and annoying cheering). That reminds me, why did you find it necessary to add that stupid cheering after a car makes it across the bridge? This isn't a pre-school computer program.Also, where is this workshop that it mentions? That was one of the reasons I got this. So that was also a disappointment. People probably could've added some interesting things to this game, but whatever.Summary: This game is boring. There isn't enough creativity involved. The visuals are dated. The controls are not smooth enough when they work. The sound quality is awful. Overall, I would not even think about paying $20 for it. This game seems like it should be $5 dollars. The original price gave me a higher expectation, which it definitely did not come close to meeting.			"

												I give this a slightly yes, and purchase when on sale. What hurts this game is the inconsistant physics engine coupled with the 'slamming on' when the testing scenerio begins.  The bridges never yield the same results after testing.  Conditions are always the same, results should BE the same.  Draw bridges a lot of times stick together when they should cleary be separiting.   I'm not a big fan of winning games by chance; winning some scenerios means just retesting and the bridge will hold second or third try.  On the positive side, it is pretty cool to see basic construction physic in play and the challenge of getting  the bridge to span the gap.  Plenty of room for improvment.  It would be nice to see additional scenerios added to the game now that I've played them all.			"

												I really enjoy bridge simulator games, but this is the worst one that I've played. There is no consistency in how materials behave, the interface is infuriating, and rather than being fun to play, I find it a tedious chore.Many levels have identical setups; however, a bridge that just worked on one behaves completely differently on the other. The first will have zero stress while at rest and easily handles the traffic while the second will have red on all joints and will fail the instant any traffic touches it. The game shows no reason for this change in behavior. It simply is the way things work.As for the interface, it is very difficult to edit a bridge. This results in my rebuilding the bridge from scratch each time or just using undo until it removes the part I want removed and beginning again from that point. The reason for this is that I can right-click a piece to remove it, but it doesn't remove the entire section that was added, just a portion of it. If I place down two sections to brace the bridge, I need to right click and remove around 10 different segments to remove those two sections. There is the ability to draw a box around sections to highlight them and them remove them, but many times, the cursor will change to indicate that it is select mode yet will still add new sections, making it difficult to use that tool. Even when the select tool works, it removes too much as it will remove joint placement points for remaining sections, making them unusable.I tried to like this game, but the flaws show me that this is simply a ""us too"" bridge simulator and not one made to be a quality and enjoyable game.

												I paid a buck and still feel ripped off.This is an amusing game insofar that for something that is a blatant copy of better predecessors it still is so badly implemented that it begs the question...Why?Controls are AWFUL. Counter-intuitive and just plain stupid. I can't single out anything in particular because there is not ONE THING this game does right in terms of control. Even just connecting two pieces together is frustrating at times.The physics are beyond awful. They're not consistent and often nonsensical. I'd say half the time it works, the other half it's destroying itself. Honestly, if it wasn't so frustrating to control and build in this game I would give the physics a pass as barely sufficient enough, but as it stands it just piles it on.The only difficulty that arises in this game is fighting the controls. The levels are boring, uninspired and too easy. The achievements also seem to glitch out. I was getting them too early at times and other times it took a while to register.The graphics are dated but I suppose this is one of the better looking bridge building games  but it's also the worst to play so...yay?

												I had played all the big titles at E3. Private showings of God of War III, Heavy Rain, Alan Wake. But at 4:00 on Thursday, I was wandering around the show floor, wondering what else I had to see. I saw a small little booth for “Bridge Project” in the Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment section. I mean, who goes to that booth? But I remember hearing about it on GAF, and so I decided to check it out.Best game of E3? Without a ♥♥♥♥ing doubt. Anyone who says otherwise did not play Bridge Project. Best game of all time? Jesus Christ, I don’t know, maybe. It’s a game that challenges your IMAGINATION. No other game has ever done that.So listen to this story. I was in the early levels; I didn’t quite have an idea of how ridiculously in-depth the database was. I was summoning things like ladders, glasses of water, rayguns, what have you. But I reached a level with zombie robots, and the zombie robots kept killing me. Rayguns didn’t work, a torch didn’t work, a pickaxe didn’t work. In my frustration, I wrote in “Time Machine”. And one popped up. What the ♥♥♥♥? A smile dawned on my face. I hopped in, and the option was given to me to either travel to the past or the future. I chose past. When I hopped out, there were ♥♥♥♥ing dinosaurs walking around. I clicked one, and realized I could RIDE THEM. So I hopped on a ♥♥♥♥ing DINOSAUR, traveled back to the present, and stomped the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of robot zombies. Did you just read that sentence? Did you really? I ♥♥♥♥ING TRAVELED THROUGH TIME AND JUMPED ON A DINOSAUR AND USED IT TO KILL MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING ROBOT ZOMBIES. This game is unbelievable. Impossible. There’s nothing you can’t do.Holy ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												This is a nice game, with some replayability, which quickly gets you addicted. The game, however, is extremely flawed. Some flaws are easy to ignore, others are not. The interface is quite cumbersome. Having played the ""Bridge It"" demo a few days ago, I found this game's interface much worse than Bridge It's. The worst part however, is the dynamics and physics. It is all wrong. I have a background in mechanical engineering, so this game has quite an appeal for me. This also makes me look at it with a more critic point of view, and my expectations are quite high in this kind of game.My negative evaluation of this game comes exactly from the engineering parts of it. It is inexcusable for this game of game to not employ the proper structural calculations. Finite element analysis has come a long way, and it would be a great approach on a game like this. So, my opinion is: if you want a game like this, go for ""Bridge It"": it has nicer graphics, a better and more intuitive interface, is faster and more precise calculations. "

												Bridge Project is one of those games that doesn’t really know where to put itself, it's obviously a simulation game, but a bizarre mix of casual and complex themes makes it a difficult game to review. You see, with Bridge Project you create bridges using a set amount of materials given to you, however the pros and cons of these materials is never truly explained. It's as though the game assumes you are already mid-way through a bridge engineering degree. With little to no tutorial level aside from a few help pages which inform you only of how to navigate menus and not build bridges, you are left alone to build a bridge out of your wood, iron and suspension cables. This inevitable leads to you building a bridge which looks more than safe, only to have it unexpectedly explode into a thousand pieces. As the game never explains why your previous bridge failed, you are left alone to try again. Eventually one of your attempts may hold up just long enough to support a bus, and you can progress. The control system is surprisingly hard to get used to considering its simplicity, a very limited menu system means building the bridge is made even harder, and the lack of motivation or reason behind the game means it becomes a chore to move on to the next level. Most simulators fit into one category, they are either fun to play or they teach you something, however Bridge Project is desperately trying to fit both categories, and missing both because of it. I had very little fun playing it as it felt like luck was the main factor in a bridges success or not, and i learnt nothing about bridges or how they work. This works fine as a flash or mobile game, but to justify its current PC price tag this game needs to be finished. 4/10 "

												There are plenty of reasons to warmly recommend this game.From the complete lack of any tutorials or explanations whatsoever, to the messy and unavigable interface, to the clunky controls that make it hard to even select or delete stuff.There's also the unbelievable unrealistic physics where a nail supports the weight of a tank and a steel structure collapses under a breeze. And the auto building which likes to put iron bars in the middle of the road for your vehicles to thrash.Don't forget the numerous bugs and crashes that also come with this game, for free! In two hours of play I crashed maybe 3 times.So with this incredible bonanza how can I give it a negative rating? It's the music really. The horribly cheesy medley of convenience store and elevator music really makes it unplayable, sadly :( "

												I've played better flash games than this! If you enjoy this type of game, you should know this one has great graphics but poor UI. To delete a simple part can be tricky and the undo button only goes back a few steps, not all the way to the start. This can be a problem in a big bridge with many parts. Still, the physics are good and there is an earthquake test and a few cute surprises. If only it was more user friendly. I have parts that are not explained ingame. How do I place it, how to use it, wheres the nasty walktrough ? There is also a nasty grid that does more harm than good. I struggle a bit playing it without getting into frustration. For those familiar with a flash game called Cargo Bridge from Armor Games, its alot easier and fun. Just buy this if you prefer a fullscreen game, with better graphics, but get ready to get angry and confused sometimes with the UI.			"

												Level design & physics are a bit iffy. Pretty game, fun for the first hours. Annoying the second hour once you meet the buggy physics. Then too simple for the last few hours once you figure out how the physics work.I'd rate about 4/10Pick it up for a couple of dollars for an hour of fun. Don't pay full price. You'll be disappointed.			"

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 23, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												I like this game as a timewaster but as others have said the physics are way off. Also the global scoreboard is worthless as people have posted impossibly high scores (using only 16 pieces on City 8? yeah, I'll believe that :/ ) . What would be better (aside from better physics) is if the top 10 or so scores were shared so you could download those bridges and see how they worked. The interface feels really clunky at times. Revisions are problematic. It sometimes puts auto cross pieces in the middle of where cars go. The ""select-all"" tool won't select everything sometimes it'll just randomly skip pieces. Overall, since I got it on humblebundle I'm not too upset because as I say, its a good time waster, but if I had paid full price for this game I'd probably be furious at how bad the simulation part is. But I'm not sure how fixable that is.			"

While the core mechanics remain the same as the simple 2d vector game from 15 years ago, there's a lot to be said for continuing the core mechanic but making the extra materials and 3d editing relatively easy.  There's a simple joy in creating the cheapest (and pretty much most unsafe) bridge you possibly can that holds up (or not).  Oh, and there's draw bridges!			"

												Quite a poor bridge building game. I'm sure its not the worst, but it definately isnt the best. I found the physics to be quite off, the why you placed peices was incredebly taxing. It was very difficult the way things where set up to purpously place suports where you ment to, I found myself often placeing things off on the games grid.The thing that bothered me most about this game was that I you can only make traditinal draw bridges, and cannot make a vertical lift bride, although there seems no reason why it should not be posible with the peices given to you on the levels they are avalible.Overall I did not hate the game but offten found it annoying, and when it comes down to it I dont think it was worth the time or money to play through it.

												After playing Bridge-It, this is almost painful to play. I've done about 9 of the bridges thus far, thus far the things that drive me nuts are:1. Mechanics of moving around, zooming, twisting are much more difficult to utilize.2. Pistons... Pistons... Pistons. I know how they are intended to work, however with the poor implementation of 'open/closed' joints, they simply make the game frustrating. If you have a joint 'open' without a piston attached, it is a hinge. If you have a joint 'open' with a piston attached it is supposed to actually open... HOWEVER which side is going to open? If you build a bridge to lift the middle section straight up, the game picks both 'open' joints to release on the left side, this causes one side of your middle plate to lift, but not the other. The other side pulls against the main structure on that side and rips the bridge apart. Obviously you can only use open joints that open in one direction, guess things can't be turned 180 degrees in their reality. 3. Graphics just don't seem on par with Bridge-It, and seems big & clunky.Maybe if I hadn't come from another bridge game straight to this one I'd be able to put up with this, however I'm not impressed. Thankfully I picked up the game as part of a 'humble bundle' so it didn't cost much.			"

												Jelly physics at their worst.If you fail a level, don't think you've done something wrong, quite often retrying the tests you'll pass fine.Your steel cables have a habit of detaching themselves for no apparent reason, and suspension cables are almost always useless to you due to having the same bend mechanism as the curved line in ms paint.To top that off, completely symmetrical drawbridge builds, have a habit of closing lopsided and making your bridge commit suicide - these ones you really need to retest a few times, they'll usually work after a few tries.Getting worse, the crossframes. The auto build crossframe feature is buggy at best, and has a nasty habit of building them right in the path of oncoming vehicles - at later levels you'll find yourself turning this on and off a few times lest the first bus destroy your creation due to no fault of your own.Then there's the sporadic forgot the stress colour system, which loves to get stuck on red with random parts - once again changing each time retested with equal things.Move a connecting point, no parts adjust, just screws you upSelect mode has no toggle feature, so you have to click it, then make your selection and god help you if you miss, you'll have to click select mode again!Finally, the overall lack of DECENT camera control. use your arrows and it pans, turn on cursor focus and it drifts slowly when trying to place things, try cursor movement off after alt tabbing a single time and it doesn't actually regain mouse focus - you're stuck switching cursor focus on and off again to make larger levels even playable.Overall, bug riddled.Don't get me wrong, it was a bit of fun playing, I even enjoyed the vehicle view as it was fun to crash repeatedly.Just could have been implemented so much better.As it stands it's near equal to other bridge builder games coded in flash.It just looks a little prettier.I'd recommend playing the flash game cargo bridge first. If you can't get enough of that then this may be up your alley.Otherwise, be prepared to be annoyed by a clunky interface, random physics glitches every time you test, and the everlasting questioning of why, seeing your brand new bridge rammed by a bus due to those crossframes.

												If you like to solve physics puzzles this game could be right up your ally.  Bridge Project sets you with the task of bridging various gaps in different terrain locations.  And not only does your bridge need to stand up it has to pass tests.  These could be a series of vehicles traveling over your bridge.  Or maybe the bridge has a a drawbridge to allow a boat to pass under it.  To the more extreme like surviving an earth quake or cross winds.  Although bridge project is a simple concept there is multiple ways to complete each mission.  Try to make the strongest bridge.  Or try to cut costs and corners as far as possible.  The choice is yours.			"

												This game is all right. If you're up to some relaxing bridge building simulation puzzle, then I would recommend grabbing this game and play it casually or 'in one shot'. If played the latter way, it should take you no more than 2 days (possibly even less) to finish all the puzzles (there are 48 of them in total).Amongst the downsides is the glitchinness of physics, which causes two runs of the same build to be slightly different, therefore making some bridge configurations unreliable.If you like getting achievements in games, this game also has them, although if you strive for getting 100%, there is one achievement which is very hard (even impossible) to get due to the aforementioned glitchinness of physics. At the moment of this writing though, it could be obtained fairly easily by exploiting one of the other glitches in the game.Overall, despite all negative details outlined above, I would recommend this game, just not at the current price of $20. My personal price for this game would be $5-7, so if you ever see it on sale at that price, get it and play it. Have fun!			"

												Bridge-building games are a weakness of mine. The challenges are well-defined yet open-ended - the game doesn't care if you support your road with a rectangular truss, with an arch, or with two big towers and lots of cables stretching downwards as long as the result is solid enough to do the job, but no bridge, however beautiful, can succeed if it is not solid.Unfortunately, the physics engine of Bridge Project is not solid.Let me tell you what I would like to do in this - and every other - bridge-building game. I would like to make a bridge that can do the job and keep doing it forever without a problem. A bridge that 'passes' the tests with popped bolts and cracked pavement is a bridge that doesn't pass the tests in my book, and once I got into the later levels in Bridge Project, making a bridge not fail became an exercise in sheer madness. This was especially evident in my first drawbridge level, when the pistons themselves would torque the roadway into destruction ... but only on the right-hand side of my completely symmetrical design. Bridge Project does not seem to be able to make steady, predictable models of bridge behavior.This problem would not be so thoroughly frustrating if the interface were better, but it is not. There is an Undo but no Redo (and the Undo only remembers five or so steps), keyboard shortcuts exist for some things but not others (and none of them are explained), many of my favorite bridge gimmicks (e.g. making trusses with a triangular cross-section, meeting above the center of the bridge) are impossible for no apparent reason, the only kind of save file is the quicksave button ... given the trial-and-error aspect of bridge building games, the way Bridge Project makes it a pain to iterate and retry is painful.The experience is not all terrible - the scenery is pretty, even if the bridges are not, and it is nice to require that bridge designs not block the passage of vehicles - but the frustrating, random, stupid aspects make this a decidedly inferior game. Get it on the cheap or don't bother.			"

												It is fun. But, its ui isn't good. I think that simple physics is much better than this one.It is really hard to control. And imperfect 3d is not intuitional than 2d. At least the game should support 2d mode when people construct the bridge.			"

												After not even an hour of time playing this i never want to touch it again. Additionally to the reasons from the other reviews there is a simple reason why this game just doesnt deserve to be neither played nor bought: it makes rounding errors as soon as you build structures not completly horizontally, That leads to situations where you can build an arch when starting from both sides and meeting in the center, but dont have enough material if you build it from one side to the other. Ridiculous and an insult to the gaming world.			"

												While there's SOME fun to be had here and the game looks decent, you're constantly fighting the interface, a general bugginess (one that manifests in most areas of the game), and an inconsistent physics engine (particularly frustrating since the relative strength of the building materials is already unrealistic).This was a game that I started with hope, patiently tweaked & fiddled to work around its issues, but ultimately finished because I'm stubborn and I just wanted to be done with it so I could uninstall it and never return to it again. And, having now finished it, I found the process punishing enough that I was motivated to write this negative review.One last negative note:I deliberately avoided earning one final achievement (the only one not automatically earned by completing the game) since I didn't want this Bridge Project on my list of ""perfect games"" on my Steam profile. This is both because its presence there might be seem an endorsement of sorts, and because its existence would be commemorated (in a way) by joining the short list of games where I have earned every achievement (currently at 3 out of 400+); among whose company it is unworthy to be.

												This game is a pretty good waste of time. Also pretty good if you, like me, get the thrill of getting all/almost all of the achievements. Some of the levels do get very challenging, but still doable. I got it on the Humble Bundle for only $1 with 3 other games. So for $1.00, this game is worth it (I spent about 6 hours playing until I completely beat all the levels and got all the achievements). The game has steam workshop so, even after you beat it, you can still play many user-made levels. However, I can't really recommend this game if it's more than $5-7, let alone the $19.99 it's retailing for right now. Controls are pretty wonky, some levels are frustrating, beating a level depended more on luck than skill,  and there is no point in playing through the main levels again after beating them. If you really want to play this game, I encourage you to wait and purchase it on sale.			"

												SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! NOT WORTH IT!!! This is a five thumbs down!! I wish I would have actually looked at the reviews before buying this horrible example of a physics simulator. The controls are not user friendly and the physics do not respond like you would imagine. There are more issues with the game but I don't feel like putting in the effort...since the game makers didn't put any effort in make the simulator it's only appropriate.  Nothing about this game is worth $19.99. I would not be as bummed if it was only $4.99 and sucked this bad (which is still over priced for what you get) but at $19.99 I'm totally upset. Can't blame anyone but myself though. The reviews spot all the glaring problems with this game and I didn't even think of scrolling down to read them before I bought it.			"

												If you have any interest in building, this is a must! There's a quick learning curve with many flexible strategies. Plan the project, turn on the phyiscs!  You don't have to be an engineer, but you'll feel like one.  I beat all the missions (and achievements) in a day, however I've built ramps, decks, and platforms in real life.  Difficulty varies from filling the gap to cables fighting earthquakes.  The game has a few glitches and ""interesting"" physics, but to no dismay.  Heavy weather allows a little damage to pass. Hilariously, I had one bridge PASS and then COLLAPSE!Overall... short, sweet, stimulating.  Wait for the sale.

												I remember playing Pontifex fondly a good few years ago, and when I heard this was the new version from the same developers I was keen to try it out. Unfortunately, it does not play well. The mouse pointer is slow and feels like it is running through treacle. Point and clicking is a hit and miss affair, frequently you end up laying pieces where you did not want to, and most frustratingly, removing those misplaced pieces is incredibly difficult. What should have been as simple as right clicking to remove (which I'm sure Pontifex used to do) is now left click, right click until the sub menu appears, then hit delete. Frequently this menu does not appear, so you have to use another 'select' tool insteadWhich brings me on to another issue. There is no guidance at all. The UI is unintuitive and offers little help.

												Can't recomend this game.  The controlls are very clunky and unintuitive.  The ""free"" camera for looking around is still limited mostly to the bridges profile and pretty useless.  Even setting the game speed to maximum for testing your construction, it still takes almost a minute for the different waves of cars, busses, tanks, and trains to simulate.  Very frustrating when the construction fails on the last round and you have to wait.  The only thing new to bridge construction games this offers is being tested by wind storms and earthquakes.  Not worth $20, if you really want to try it, wait until it's on sale for no more than $5.			"

												Who knew building bridges could be so much fun? Ever wonder how bridges you drive through everyday hang? Ever wonder how real world physics work? Not really, right? Well now, after you play this game you will have a greater appreciation with the way bridges function and keep itself together. No longer will you be dumbfounded when asked about bridges! This is a worthy bridge-building puzzle game that deserves all the bits and bytes it runs on.			"

												Can't recomend this game.  The controlls are very clunky and unintuitive.  The ""free"" camera for looking around is still limited mostly to the bridges profile and pretty useless.  Even setting the game speed to maximum for testing your construction, it still takes almost a minute for the different waves of cars, busses, tanks, and trains to simulate.  Very frustrating when the construction fails on the last round and you have to wait.  The only thing new to bridge construction games this offers is being tested by wind storms and earthquakes.  Not worth $20, if you really want to try it, wait until it's on sale for no more than $5.			"

SO YOU MUST BUILD A BRIDGE AS CHEAPLY AS POSSIBLE SO PEOPLE CAN GET THERE ASSES TO THEIR KIDS LITTLE LEAGUE GAME. I PREFER MAKING THEM STRUCTURALLY UNSOUND SO PEOPLE CRASH AND FALL THROUGH. ALSO WHERE ARE THE SUICIDE JUMPERS? IF YOU DONT HAVE A DEGREE IN CIVIL ENGINEERING DON'T WORRY. JUST MAKE SOME ♥♥♥♥ING GHETTO BRIDGES.			"

												Nope.This game is just bad, From the graphics enigine to the physics engine.When I read the reviews about the physics being wrong, I didn't care much since I wasn't looking for a realistic bridge building simulator or anything.It turns out that when the other reviews said the physics is wrong they meant to say its terrible.You make a bridge, point A to point B, no supporting structures or anything, test it out see how it runs,Just as expected it collapses like it should.You put one support pillar for the second test, and the whole damn bridge blows up like it's TNT. It does not collapse anymore it just blows up. I don't know how that makes sense but it feels like if you bridge is not the same as the ""correct answer"" the bridge will just explode as soon as you hit play.			"

												If you like construction games, this might be one to consider. It is easy to learn and you will be building bridges on no time and the game does not look to bad either. I question the parts you get in specific maps though, one in particular where it seems impossible to build a stable bridge. The game also seems to check the bridge differently each time you try, the first time you check the bridge it may collaps easily but on a second test with the same build it could hold without giving an inch.There are other games like these and may do the job a bit better.

												Bridge Project is a modest physics puzzle game in which you are tasked wtih creating bridges to meet certain conditions. The bridges are built from set-pieces and so the trick is to work out the best way of using those pieces to get the result you are after.The puzzles are simple for the most part, but offer some degree of fun. The physicsl simulation is solid enough and seems to provide consistant results. There is very little else that can be said about this game to be honest. Its a small puzzle game that offers some very basic engineering challenges. If you like that kind of thing you'll possibly have a bit of fun here. Its not a particually special game nor is there anything very inventive or interesting going on with the puzzles. Just basic and obvious bridge making. Would I recommend? Not really. If you can grab it cheap as part of a bundle or perhaps during a sale then it might be worth it. However, at the asking price of £15.99 you could spend that money on something much better.			"

												If you love bridge building games, this is a really good one! It has some real nice challenges. The gameplay does take a bit of getting used to, you won't be the first one to accidently not connect a cable to a wall or to the actual bridge. But it's all in good fun, also a very nice and calm atmosphere. Even if your bridge crashes it is fun to watch (unless it is the 10th time, but thats the problem with bridge building games haha)			"

												Although the game is alright, it's definitely not something I would advise people to buy for €20. The game slows down and uses a lot of CPU/GPU which causes an extreme FPS drop. The interface is very annoying and frustrating to use. There is no tutorial or way of learning how to play the game except trying things out and using the internet. Although the game has it's fun moments, I would advise people to buy this when it's at a price of €3 to €4 and not any higher. There are better Bridge Builder Simulators out there which cost less than this game.After trying to get all achievements (and succeding), I'd like to add that their is a random element when it comes to the physics in this game. You can build a working bridge and then having to test it multiple times (without changing the bridge at all) in order to complete the map. This random element is extremely frustrating.			"
