												I won't tell you if you'll like it or not. I'll tell you what you're getting so you can decide for yourself.Here's the major points most other reviews are missing:1. This is a sidescrolling RTS, not a platforming Terraria/Starbound clone.You do not modify your surroundings. There is no major recipe-based crafting. You don't WASD to move your hero; you drag a box around the group of units you want to control and right-click to perform move/attack/skill commands. This will not scratch that 2D sandbox-world itch.2. If you don't like the deck-building process of your favorite trading card game, you won't likely enjoy this game.You choose/enhance the characters you want, then their classes, then their tech tree bonuses, and then finally their gear and abilities before every ""level."" This is literally half the game, and it's akin to the deck-building portion of your typical TCG. You then pit this ""deck"" of characters against a random series of enemy-filled rooms and hopefully find pride in the outcome of your well thought out preparations. This inevitably results in a couple dozen more items (read: ""new cards for your deck"") with which you rinse and repeat endlessly. How this comparison is being missed until now is beyond me, but it's an incredibly important aspect to understand before you sink your teeth into this game.3. Your first couple hours can be hard to enjoy as your decisions/mistakes will not feel meaningful/consequential.You won't start off with much of anything to do beyond selecting all of your units, right-clicking bad guys, and waiting for everything to die. Fortunately, this isn't the case after your first hour or two. You'll also eventually realize the significance of your resources as soon as you run out of one for the first time (e.g., the currency for shopping, the currency for cloning items and reviving, the currency for your tech tree, or the fuel for exploring new levels). Much more importantly, however, you'll discover (on your own, after the tutorial) that the difficulty of each individual ""level"" can be scaled through the roof as you see fit; there's no need to bore yourself to death versus enemies that require no thought or effort to defeat. And before you ask, scaling the difficulty up does reward you with better loot drops accordingly, so it's a satisfying choice instead of an arbitrary, self-imposed challenge.4. The amount of content is appreciably greater than most ""loot 'em ups.""Each class feels uniquely important with a wide variety of sub-specialties to choose from within each class. The active and passive buffs and unlocks you'll have to pick from in the tech tree are mostly all interesting. The random item modifiers on your gear range from the typical +stats, resistances, and status immunities to auto-casting unique spells on weapon reload and ensuring a chance to drop consumables on kill. The art for each world feels rich and engrossing. The enemies you'll encounter are varied enough in behavior, ability, and art that you likely won't think to complain. The random NPCs and quest-givers you'll come across frequently have distinct personalities and charm. There's also a decently-lengthed story-focused quest line, procedurally generated side missions, unexpected random encounters, and your typical market fare (buying and selling from stores, shipyards, blackmarkets, etc).  If this review was helpful, please say so via the button below. Thanks!   "

												Pixel Privateers is in no way a bad game, however there are issues with the gameplay and mechanics that let it down as a whole.Disclaimer: I do not hate this game, I actually quite like it, however I feel that 87% is too high for what this game offers so I'm writing a review explaining my opinion.Pros:+ART: Some of the pixel artwork is pretty lovely, the bases and planets are well detailed and beautiful+WORLD: The world and concept is nice, it stays pretty consistant with races and characters; There are cyborgs in this galaxy that have spread out over countless worlds, as well as a race of bio-monsters that want to turn all genetics into their fleshy masses of DNA, and you're trying to get technology from these worlds for The Company. It gets a bit more advanced later on, but stays at the 'passable' stages and never quite overtakes a lush and consistent sci-fi world like say FTL+LOOT: There is plenty of Borderlands-esque loot; I also like that what look you equip determines their class. Every character has 4 slots and you can spend ages just fitting out your guys after a couple missions of loot.+TECH TREES: I like the researching mechanic in the game, despite its simplicity; You just pick up items and they gain research points over time which you can spend on identifying rares or upgrading a crew-wide research tree.Cons:-BUGS: Could not use an elevator and had to force quit the game. Melee units would not attack certain enemies. Units would sometimes walk back and forth in the middle of combat and doing nothing. Hold position button does nothing. Right clicking to attack enemies as they beam into your ship causes all your units to move to it. Can cheese losing situations by quitting the game and everybody gets max halth again. Game breaking framerate at some boss levels. Sold all my inventory, went back to crew tab and it was still there. That's just a handful of the ones I remember right now.-SIMPLICITY: At the start, when you have 2-3 guys, combat requires thought, and pausing it with the spacebar. However, late game is just a grind of taking your 8 man squad of level 26 guys with guns, selecting them all, and right clicking every enemy in order until they're all dead. This plays into my next point...-NO AUTO ATTACK!?: Yours guys do not auto attack. This is a huge, huge problem and reduces incentive for using strategic attacks, and encourages just using your entire squad to attack one enemy. Say there's a group of three enemies; if they kill the first one, if you do nothing they just won't attack; they would all die before attacking by themself. This seems to also include turrets and drones. This can be fixed, I'm sure, but it's a massive gaping problem that encourages zerg rushing, and unfortunately the game is still very possible using that strategy. Another problem with this is there is LITERALLY A HOLD-POSITION BUTTON that says ""Will attack enemies in range"" and it just doesn't! They still suffer from the same auto-attack issue.-VARIETY: There are plenty of enemy types in this game, don't get me wrong. But, as a whole, there seems to be 3 races: Two robots and a zerg-equivalent. The problem with this is that, using the zerg rush tactic explained above, they all have the same tactic to kill them, select everyone, right click, zerg rush, win. Very rarely do you need to, for example, move your guys out of enemy fire, get on either side of an enemy to flank, use abilities to stun or put in stasis.... Coz you just right click them all to death. To put it into perspective, I used exactly the same tactic on the bosses, including final boss; right click it to death and occasionally right click a spawned minion. The healers heal automatically so I don't need to do anything.-SHIP INVASIONS: When you're travelling around on the map, random events can occur, normally being attacked by an enemy ship. This is, without a doubt, the worst (purposely programmed) part of the game. You just walk around your ship, wait for enemies to teleport into the room, and kill them. There's no 'defense' part about it whatsoever, it's just a boring time waster that gives barely any reward. The devs must know this because there's a perk at the start AND a research tree item to lower the chance of it happening.-STORY: The 'story' itself is pretty generic; however my issue is that it drags on for so long. There is absolutely no reason this game needs to go for 12-18 hours. You'll enjoy your first 6 for sure, but the lack of variety in the late game leads to tedium and total boredom. Even the regular missions become a total chore (which you need to do a certain amount of to unlock more missions) of just blasting through 90% of a map. And, I'll put it here; two of the boss stages featured game-breaking framerate issues (The second robot boss and the first zerg boss) where my game slowed down to 10 fps. This is a pixel game. I have no idea why this happens but for lower end computers I can imagine those levels would be a total pain.-PIXEL PIRATES: You've probably realized by now that this game is developed by the same people who made Pixel pirates. Whilst not a bad game in itself, that game lacked a real driving force to grind through its countless bugs and far-too-long campaign. Privateers is better, by a long way (At least I only discovered a handful of bugs with this and not a thousand game breaking ones), it benefits from a more direct approach. However, the late stages feel like a chore with collecting 5 Macguffins, and then in true No Man's Sky fashion, the game just ends and starts you again with a different map but the same characters. If you have never played Pixel Pirates and you like the idea, you will definitely enjoy this game more than Pirates, but understand these games are not perfect. It's a meal-priced RPG strategy-lite.CONCLUSION:If you came to this game looking for an exploration game, you should try Starbound.If you came to this game looking for a space roguelike, you should try FTL.If you came to this game looking for a strategy game, try.... I dunno, Battle Brothers is pretty good lol.And if you came because ""It's by the Terraria guys!"" no, it's just published by them. If you are really digging for a good strategy-building space game, then you should 100% definitely try Rimworld instead.6/10: Game is functional but lacks a lot of stuff that makes a strategy-roguelike engaging for longer periods of time.

Product received for free
												tldr: Pixel Privateers is a Squad Based Tactical RPG “Loot ‘Em Up"", you control your squad, visit planets, accept missions, fight enemies, level up, fight bosses.+ Loot tiers and tons of loot.+ Always have a fresh feeling while exploring new planets.+ The astonishing pixelart and the music.+ The storyline/lore about the universe and the humor in the dialogues. + Replayability.+ You 'll find yourserlf craving for ""one more planet""- There is always room for improvement especially in the very high levels after finishing the storyline.- You might have to deactivate some settings in the options menu if you own a lower end pc/laptop.- You can skip the tutorial but i wouldn't suggest that, you will miss some features that aren't that obvious otherwise.Being among my most played games on steam i'm very confident to recommend this to anyone who is reading this, interested in what he/she sees in the store page. If you wish to read more about how much content there is, what are some key features and my disclaimer continue reading down below.* Playing the game for the first time in normal mode will take you around 20 hours to complete the storyline but the content can keep you busy for many many more.* Multiplayer is up to 4 people, drop in-drop out style, no servers needed.* You can play normal mode or hardcore mode (your whole crew dies = your save file is done)* You can choose your own difficulty in each planet, each one determines the loot quality you'll get.* 5 classes (Vanguard, Marine, Engineer, Scout and Medic) and you can have 1-8 crew members in your squad both for SP and MP.* Each class has their own abilities and also equipable tools which give you different extra abilities for each class.* 9 loot tiers (poor, common, uncommon, exceptional, rare, epic, artifact, legendary, ultimate).* Huge pool of modifiers meaning that your armor, weapons and tools can have some crazy stats added to them.* Many different planet types. Each planet is unique with randomly generated ""dungeons""/rooms you have to clear.* Tons of different/unique enemies from each faction. * The universe is finite with around 300-400 planets in it,but there is NG+ too (continue playing with the same squad and gear in a different universe)* Click to attack a single enemy, you can control one by one your crew members or all of them as squad, you can also pause the action in single player.* The game scales everything to you, you will have a different experience fighting at level 1 than at level 10 or 20 for example.* You can buy new ships and add modules to them which give you extra perks (for example your ship can carry more crew members).I hope this huge wall of text helped you decide if that's the game for you or not.Disclaimer: I was one of the lucky ones to be accepted in a closed beta over a year and a half ago. I got to enjoy the game throughout almost half of its developement and as a thank you to them, i as many others dedicated many hours making sure that the game will be the polised title you see today. And yes i got the game for free but it didn't change my opinion.			"

												A great concept, rough around the edges.    I am writing this as a family man with very limited time to sit down and immerse myself in games. As such my leanings lately (2015 - 2017) are games that follow this criteria (This is not exhaustive but I hope I can convey the gist)1. Inexpensive but with good value. pricing is subjective, but some games need the base game plus 4+ extra DLC in order to 'enjoy proper', I avoid this more often than not.2. Playable for minutes or hours but feels like I'm making progress no matter what. Open World games usually suceed at this, MMORPGS however not so much. When I can play in long bursts, Its because I'm enjoying the game not because I need to in order to, Save or progress. Interesting aside, I love Soulsborn because progress happens everytime you play, even if it is minute. 3.  Ability to Pause for long periods while I chase my toddler down, cook, run an errand etc4. Production Value, Mobile games and free to play usually lack this; there are exceptions like Warframe. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The above mentioned list demonstrates my situation fairly clearly I hope, I need a game that I can play within my hectic life, a game with quality that doesn't demand 4 hours at a time minimum in order to feel like that game session was worth it. Pixel Privateers fits this bill for me perfectly. It's playable in 8 hour bursts of for a quick 20 minute mission. So for my lifestyle and if you are in a similar situation to me, it's a candidate for Daddy's 45 minute breathing time until Saul, Underwood and Bojack come back... -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------As a game does it hold up??I love the idea. It's a little bit of a few genres I am endeared wtih. I love the ability to name my squaddies. My kids love hearing the stories of their little pixels saving the group or wiping out the bad guys with that new flamethrower. The gameplay is fine, but I find that larger squads require a bit micro management that I am simply not good at. There is a quality of life issue I have; My squad won't attack unless I order them to. I've had situations where I'm in a fight and my squad fights the boss, once the boss dies or explodes into a horde, I have to manually target the lesser enemies, which are small that feels like an extra step that isn't fun. The larger engagements are usually fine, but my squad not defending itself because I can't find the enemy or I'm looking up from my screen for real life issues. It's nothing major but is apparent.The style and presentation are good, Tongue in cheek full of references and I must say, almost obligatory nowadays. There is also alot of downtime between missions as you consider resources, fuel and weapon loadouts. I love it, each mission yields a surplus of items that you can sell for credits, which are used for ship upgrades, having more control on the loot you have via being abe to purchase from the shop or buying more squaddies. The other options are like the Kanai cube/Hordordic cube from Diablo to reroll 4 item types, rarity for different items or rarities and finally broken down into matter, which is used for teleporting your squad to missions and reviving the little buggers should you die on normal mode. All in all, this game is fun, engaging and with its own flaws (That could be patched out easily.... please turn on auto fire!) Thank you for your time in reading this "

												Good, but....The game really needs an option to increase the size of the text on higher resolutions. The text is so small and hard to read that it causes a lot of eye strain and headaches. I'm not even one to be prone to these sort of things, as i have good eyesight and don't wear glasses.Please add this function, Relogic.Edit: Quadro Delta is the one i should be asking, not Relogic.

												I'll complain then talk about the positives.1. Your crew doesn't attack automatically. You have to individually click every single enemy to attack them, otherwise your crew will just sit there and take damage. This must be a bug.2. You get way too many items too quickly. It forces you too spend an awful amount of time in the menus, sorting through all your new gear. You're tediously trying to figure out which items are worth your time and which aren't, and end up throwing away most of the loot you find, every single time.3. This may be because I'm not use to the controls yet, but it's difficult to use each individual crew member's abilities. I think the controls need to be reworked.4. Adding on to point 2, your items get replaced by better items too quickly. I'd like to be able to keep the same equipment for at least 3 missions. I end up swapping in better gear every single mission and that's a bit much in my opinion. Constantly getting items that are consistently better than your last items takes away from the fun in getting better items.5. Jumps in difficulty in some places is insane. On the planets it's pathetically easy how you can just plow through enemies, but I tried flying to a market right next to spawn, and I'm boarded by aliens that kill my crew in less than 10 seconds. So far I've only ever died by random encounters in space, not on any of the planets I raid.Positives:It still manages to be fun. If point 1 is fixed, and the loot is toned down considerably I'd recommend it. I don't want a menu scrolling simulator , I want to actually play the game, but not tediously so by clicking ever ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ enemy I see.			"

												A fun loot-gathering game with a ton of options regarding party-comp and character customization. Two characters of the same class need not be the same stat/skill wise, and there are a ton of weapons to choose from (there are no class/weapon restrictions). As an example, my medic uses hammers and gets bonus heals for every attack he does. He beats enemies in the face and heals while he does so.Gameplay is interesting, albeit a bit uninvolved in the early game. Planets tend to be varied and there are a few different objectives that you may receive upon landing. Gameplay consists of the loop of: Prepare party -> go to planet and get loot -> go to galaxy map -> prepare party -> repeatIt's simple, but it's addicting and the varied loot keeps me coming back for more. I recommend it if you're into games like Diablo, Path of Exile, Grim Dawn, etc.My biggest gripe, aside from a lack of truly varied objectives, is that controlling five characters is tedious, thus leading me to leave most of them on auto while I control my tank and engineer.  I would like to see more viability for having fewer than five characters in a party (three would be my sweet spot between interesting gameplay/party comp and reasonable micro-management). The game does allow you to pause mid-combat to issue orders, which helps with this; think Baldur's Gate or Pillars of Eternity.Overall, the game is quite fun and offers a really addicting loot-loop that I think will be enticing to many players.

												The game has really nice graphics and style.Alas, it totally falls short on the gameplay and tactics aspect :- the gameplay fails to evolve.You keep encountering random and unpredictable difficulty spikes which, once combat is engaged, results pretty much in the death of your squad and are unescapable : imagine you do a mission and suddenly open a door with enemies overwhelming you  in a few seconds.You can pause and all, you have a few powers to try to mitigate what is happening ; but it is like using a glass of water in a forest fire. The scale of what the players can do is ridiculously limited, shooting, and healing are for most automatic on timers things.You imagine when yhou finally build a crew quarter having more squaddies will let you manage things more finely.But no : having more squaddies means the game just drastically scales the game difficulty.Everything is scaled in a geometric manner : resarch is the same.This effectively negates any evolution in the players actions and gameplay and pretty much kills any sense of progress beyond the WOW loot colors your soldiers equip. A very poor evolution.- The tactics aspect is just for show.So, your engineer can deploy a turret. Which you will do over and over again.The medics have a pain suppression ability and a heal both on a timer.The whole thing is just crazyly underwhelming. The available player actions are more of a sideshow to the automatic heal/attacks of the squaddies. They are something to keep you busy while pretending there is some control over what is happening.But this control is just too much a fringe thing. The 2d aspect of the game combined with the lack of control of the action just gives the illusion of control and turns frustrating when you discover this does not get any better while levelling up.It really is too bad.Some inspiration over the gameplay could have turned Pixel Privateers intop a must have.But as it turns out, the gameplay choices made are just uninspired, leaving a semi automatic pilot loot management game (which there is WAAYYYY too much, seriously, another reason not to have too many recruits as it quicly turns hellishly tedious), with no true control from the player over the situation it randomly encounters.You will still have a good time discovering stuff in the game.But know it does not get any better than the hope the player gets of what could be at the beginning. The game sadly fails to deliver in what it actually becomes.A real shame that is.			"

												I have played this game for quite some time trying to uncover any secrets or story or depth. I am disappointed to say there are none. Dialogue options do not matter, outside of accepting or rejecting quests, and there seem to be no hidden secrets buried in the deepest corners of the galaxy, as a loading-screen teaser suggests. The core gameplay is fine, but it is short, extremely easy, and lacks any kind of depth.			"

												Hardly what the game was described to be. You click, your characters shoot and you wait awhile for the enemies to die. That's most of the interaction combat right there. There are some abilities, but you use them rarely. Planets you visit early are like short corridors, with a loot box at the end. Repetitive. Maybe the game gets more depth as time goes on, research actually matters and you can do more with your characters, but I couldn't get past how boring it is.			"

												A fun little loot gathering game, with a large amount of variety in enemies and planets. Good amount of customisation in regards to itemisation and character stat progression. You can have two characters of the same class, but their stats could be completely different. Moderately addictive in the way that you will keep wanting to do more planets to try and find the best loot.I have a few gripes with the game;- The main one being that text size can't be scaled up at higher resolutions, makes it a little hard to read quest text.- Another thing is the lack of auto-attack, for me personally having to click for every single attack seems a little spammy and not enjoyable.Overall I would recommend people to buy the game and see for themselves if they enjoy it, the minor problems I had with the game could easily be fixed by the devs. I don't regret my purchase, its a great little game to pass the time.For anyone who is interested, I did a play through of the tutorial and the first few planets:

												70/100, not worth $15 yet.The game has potential, but seriously tapers off after a dozen hours.Wait for later patches, see my suggestions. The game feels unfinished despite 1 major 5-part quest chain. ======== Pros/Cons ========+ Great artwork+ Loot-a-holic drops, 8 tiers (grey, dark green, light green, blue, purp, red, orange, and teal)+ Nice skilltree, multi tiers, upgrading both characters and your ship.+ Great rooms system on ships, has more potential later on.+ Love having multiple units, each class has 3 play style options based on their class relic.+ Ability to add difficulty to missions for better chance at loot drops.+ There's a few rerferences to other games, which is a trip.    (Apparently there's a cube recipe for a cow level? I would love to see a wiki for unique recipes)= Music is alright. Not blown away, but not hating it either. Chill, sorta ambient at times. = Matter / Fuel become almost useless over time with high-tier Research Point upgrade.= There's a nice number of planets to check out, but see my notes on level scaling. However, there are a ton of small things that just snowball into a poor experience.These will effect your gameplay, I guarantee it. - Major memory leaks / fps drops: I'm running a moderate+ system (i5 with a 1070 GPU)  I'll drop from 150 frames down to 20 over the course of one map. That needs to be addressed. - No Auto Attack + Hold Commands don't work: I would make more use of tactical pauses, but it's just better to set a 2x4 basic team formation (Vanguard tanks up front, Marines 2nd, Healers 3rd, and Scout/Eng in the back) and just focus fire on one monster at a time. Your units will just sit there and eat damage if you don't do something about it. Keep a finger on Q, you'll be babysitting that key.- Automatic level scaling: I love leveling to zone, and the bosses should reflect that progression as a milemarker.Nothing feels better than grinding hard, swooping solid gear then smashing a boss into next week. (It should be a 15-25-35-45-55, Final 65+ kinda deal.) This way, If I want a hard battle, I can throw on the modifiers. Instead, Give yourself 15+ mins (not kidding) to chip away at each boss and micromanage their timed minion summons. Bosses aren't a challenge as much as they are obnoxius. Every planet auto scales to you, so there's no benefit or need to travel far out to find the right zone.  The level scaling seriously kills the sense of progression in this game. - ""Company Quests"" are just cheap low-tier item / fuel / matter grabs. Take your pick of the three: Save prisoners, research rooms, collect random drops. Rinse. Repeat.- They need to change the color on their final item tier. Top tier items blend in a little too easily. Try black/red/silver striped boxes or somethin' different. - Multiplayer is a nice feature, but it needs a ton of work. I had some luck with playing LAN, but I have heard horror stories for those not playing locally. - Endgame after the warp: I watched my brother play past the final boss, but... there's... nothing.  No endgame quest trigger, no special company quests, no unique planets. Did we miss something?  Why include it if there is nothing but a replay of the same game under the guise of an ""alternative universe?""Edit: I made it to the ""alternative universe"" to see it for myself.... uhhh. Wut. ======= Final Verdict ========70/100The games an alright time sink for now, and with some much needed fixes, it could be worth 15+ bucks.They have a great idea, and some great mechanics already in place.Problem is it's lacking some basic features and endgame content. It still has gameplay killing bugs.Either wait for it to go for less than $6-7 on a sale, or wait until 1.0.2 or much later is released.This game was... finished, but not really, you know?======== Dev Suggestions ========- Fix Auto Attack / Hold Commands- Chef Zakarian made a great point about the game having an RTS feel, but not having a intelligent/behavior autoattack system. I linked his review below:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041699470/recommended/342640/- Remove Level Scaling. It's killing your game.- Address Memory Leaks + FPS Drop. - Please add a convenient to access loot filter. Once you hit 10k Matter, you're really  just looking for Purple's or higher to do cube rolling. Things to add?- Add more quest variants: ""Timed"" Explore/Kill, Multiplanet Escort Missions, Maybe a ""clear infection/wipe out mutiple hives"" Maybe a ""Distress Beacon, check out this ship"" quest. Hell, I would love a ""Help fix a warp gate"" quest to help create waypoints for far exploring. - Endgame: Perhaps Legendary Class Relic quests, Maybe a rare merchant quest leading to a get upgradeable ship rooms, making matter/fuel useful again.  Introduce Minor/Major sockets add-ons allowing us to tweak with Purple or lesser items. - Play with random encounters: Let me decide to pick up those hitcherhikers that always become Punks invading my ship. Currently they are more of a headache then ""oh wow, this could be neat"". - Add ""warp gates"" that we can reach from the outposts, or allow us to save warp locations. - Add ""home base"" near the first wormhole, where we can store items, maybe have NPCs chill?- Play with your cube crafting system, it's an awesome little thing to gamble/reroll, but you could do some end game customization with it. A recipe tracker tab on the box would be nice.- Trading in multiplayer, it would be nice to have an item/resource economy to encourage dedicated MP. As a side rant, I have put the game down twice trying to get to the 5th boss because I have to fly about 400+ fuels distance (no, I'm not kidding) Why are 4 major bosses within 30 fuel of eachother and this one is so far out?Those interruptions are now the sole the bane of my existence in your game.I wrote this review rather than deal with the trip to the 5th boss.

												Pixel Privateers is no what I was expecting. Before I bought this game, I'll be honest, I was rescearching how to get a refund. But I was suprised just how well it delivered. I'm sorry if for this overly long review. But if you are wanting to know if this is your kind of game READ THIS REVIEW.-Disclaimer-My entire playthrough of the game is not finished. My point of view is also only from a Normal mode point of view may be different in Hardcore mode.-First impressions-I booted up the game and saw this beutiful screen. It was running pretty smooth. I'm even playing this game on a laptop that is so old, it want turn on without being plugged in. The tutorial was had some humor and went really well, though it could go a bit more indepth on the stats. The only problem was the menu screens. Everybody complains that it is way to much. I find that it is very well organised for something that could have been really bad. The problem with it, is the background stars. It lagged my computer to an unplayable fps. Luckily, you can turn off the stars, but it will take away the blue coloring along with it, leaving a boring black screen behind them. The desert planets are also extremely laggy. There is no option that can fix this. This also makes the surveying missions near impossible, but still luckily are.-Gameplay-The gameplay is very simple, but fun. You request some missions, go to a planet, kill the enemies, loot your surroundings, fisish the mission, and get your sweet reward. The planets are easy on a normal setting, but you can set a different difficulty at any point of going to that planet. The one time I changed a planets difficulty to 10% more enemy health, I was unable to beat it. I did change it back to normal mode, but this one room was impossible to get pass at my current point. Selecting your crew is easy. You can press q to select all, you can select a crew member's icon, or you can select them the same you way you would select a computer application. The abilities are useful but most of the most useful, take hit streaks. Hit steaks are easy to get but this causes the auto-tactical mode option, which tactical is where you can pause mid-game and plan what you are going to do next, to ultimatly become some what useless until 1-2 seconds into battle. Tactical mode is really useful but keep forgetting to use it, which can mean death, if death was a common threat. Tactical mode is also REALLY useful for items. When you need to set a trap for an enemy, use tactical mode. When you need to heal, use tactical mode.-Mechanics for items and training-Out side of battling, you have the menus. I will be honest, you may be looking at these for a while, but unlike everybody says, it is NOT as long as the gameplay on the planets are. This may be true in the begining of the game, but it can change after a few hours. The stats, training as it is called in the game, aren't explained in-game. If you hover over them with your mouse, it will become clear to you quickly. It is like video editing and some forms of computer programming. You can't make sense of it at first, but you will quickly. Items are the same way. You are given a lot of loot and you will be switching items a ton. I actually really liked this whole looking through the items thing for one reason. You have to plan who gets what. You can't give one guy the best gear and everybody else the hand-me-downs. You will have to think, which I love. When I saw that the game had weapon modifiers in its description, I was thinking Terraria modifiers. These are the same idea, but they don't feel like the are. I very rarely give them a second thought.-Mechanics for crew-Changing the subject to the crew, you have up to five. If you get six, the game makes you feel like a jerk, and FORCES you to disintegrate the extra passenger. This isn't Pixel Piracy, where it would make some since to do so. You are the good guys in this game. Anyway, If one of your crew happens to die in battle, to things could happen. 1: The rest of your team will die, which causes you leave the surface. This works 80% of the time for some reason, so you may have to press ""esc"" and go to the main menu. Don't worry, you want lose any progress. You will thin have to reconstruct crew, which uses matter. Matter is also a rescource that I saw somebody say was annoying and hard to come by. unless you are dying every ten seconds, you want be running out. 2: You some how survived and can retrive while still on planet. While you're not in combat, you can double click his Icon and he will be reconstructed with the price being only matter. To ubtain matter. get read of some usless items and/or choice it as a reward. You can clone a crew member but I would imagine that it isn't the most useful in Normal mode.-Mechanics for your spaceship-This is the shortest of the mechanics. You can extend and costumize your ship, but it isn't as I've grand as something like building it. I could be wrong though since I am yet to get to a ship dock. What can say about it though is that it will help you in the long run. Flying your ship is not like star wars anything like that. I have never played Pixel Piracy, but from what I have seen it, It may be similar to it, but more important and fleshed out. If the Pixel Piracy's traveling was bugged out, I can comfirm that Privateers, is not bugged and pretty interesting. Moving your spaceship will cost fuel. This fuel can only be obtained in market places for high prices low quantity or by choicing it as a reward. I have not had problems with fuel but you will have to keep a very close eye on it. I don't now what will happen if you run out, but there is a distress signal button to save your buns. I just have a feeling that it isn't the cheap.-The conclusion-This game is very well done and polished. I thought I saw a bug once in the game but even that wasn't true. I just didn't pay attention to my surroundings. It may lag with the stars and the desert planets may be worse when it comes to fps, but nothing else is bad. The gameplay pulls you in. The mechanics perfectly balanced. I would recommend this everybody who likes this type of game. Everyone except one. If you have a slow, laggy computer that doesn't play many games well, AVOID THIS GAME! The game is very good and you should give it a go but make sure you know your computer can handle it. Test it on your computer, and if it lags extremly badly on the lowest of setting, pull out a refund. The game is the most demanding game I have.Re-Logic and Quadro Delta, if you are reading this, Thank you for making such an awesome game.-Update-I have finally gotten futher into ship mechanics. You can buy an new ship for high price... unless you have been saving the whole game, like I have. You can easily change the the rooms by clicking the green gear and selecting the room you want it to be. You must have a ship module to do so, which aren't the cheapest things in the world. You can also add in turrents/traps, but two conditions must be true.1: You have a ship turrent/trap. 2: You must have that room changed from default. It is simple as that.			"

												Despite loving this game at first, I have to say I would not recommend this game to other friends.  It gets really repetitive and the fun wears off really quickly.  Each planet is basically the same one with reskinned textures and differend layouts that get old quick.  The final boss was quite a let down and there's no real desire to do NG+ after completing the short main story.  If you're looking for a few hours of fun, this game has it.  It has potential and I can see DLC improving this game a lot.  But if you're looking to sink hundreds of hours into this game you will get very bored quickly.			"

TL;DR? It's basically Pixel Piracy, but like, in space. So, that's a plus I guess.(I'm no professional review...er? Critic, I'm no professional critic.)I'm just going to get right down into it. The game is great, but not so great where I can enjoy it for hours upon hours on end. The gameplay gets rather repetative, the ""story"" is lackluster, and the loot mechanic... my God, don't even get me started. You spend almost 2-5k on an unidentified weapon in the blackmarket only to find something even better on the planet you were just prepping for. What the hell, I get that it's likely a mixture between a lot of games (Namely a Borderlands or Diablo loot mechanic feel), and that's not always a bad thing, but Pixel Privateers just doesn't feel... right.However, this game isn't all bad. As above, I state it's great. And it is, I absolutely love the 'pixelated' genre some games go for. Pixel Privateers does it well, hell so did Pixel Piracy. The cute little banter your crew occasionally does is interesting, the Glorious is a mysterious... infection? that I want to find out more about. Even the random events that are triggered sometimes are awesome. Hell, met a guy named Thomas (Forgot last name) whose ship was attacked by the Glorious and he was a sole survivor. Now I got his ship and him as a member, pretty awesome RP element right there.Another thing I don't like though, but this is a personal opinion so take it as a grain of salt I suppose, is that there's no immersive travel.I remember back when I first got Pixel Piracy, I f**king loved how when you wanted to travel somewhere, the 'loading screen' would be you and your crew on a boat. Singing sea shanties?, talking, and better yet, the boarding of enemy ships. Pixel Privateers just doesn't have that, now it's you staring at a rather uninteresting map (similar to that of the before mentioned game) and maybe sometimes an event will trigger. Good or bad, regardless. It's just something that bugs me.  Rating 1-10   Gameplay 7   Story 3   Nostalgia 10 Final review? Just enough to warrant a recommendation. I really do like this game and hope to see more come of it.(Question for the Dev Team (Or those who'd like to help a fellow out), if possible to answer: So, eventually I've reached a point in game to where I try to load my save, the game freaks out and lags me to hell. I've had to start several new games because of this. Any way to fix that?) "

												I won't recommend it as it still has a fair number of problems to be considered as early access state. - Low fps even in the main menu, low fps while in game. Making all low ends or mid ends computer unable to play smoothly and this cause problems to enjoy the game fully.- High usage of memory even though a game like this shouldn't.- Multiplayer is not stable, constantly out of sync even with good and stable internet.- Multiple bugs such as falling through the elevator, unable to attack, target enemies or move, enemies constantly being teleported around like a ragdoll. (This problems mainly occured in multiplayer so it might be out of sync problems instead of game.)- Even after the lastest patch v1.0.1, only rarely the crew will auto attack, otherwise they would just stand there being attacked and die like an idiot.- Multiplayer should allow other players to view planets and market places information. Otherwise making viewing the map fairly useless except the host.- Bugs even in single player such as unable to use elevator or opening doors, etc.- There's this system where you will encounter enemies boarding your ship and you have to fight them off but it's so boring. The turrets and traps you put are just plain boring, only adding damage and thats all regardless what of you put. No point planning at all.- Sometimes, tools are unable to be used when not put on auto-used.- Characters falling through the fall and having a seizure teleporting up and down when falling off a elevator. (Likely a bug)Alot of problems mainly happens in multiplayer. Fps is a huge problemsthough. Having to keep spamming right click to make sure your crew attack is also problem and really take a chunk of enjoyment away.  So far the planets only have a few background enviroments but with a number of different weapons which is nice but enemies not so much. Enemies either has gun or melee weapons or cyborgs. I only fought a few bosses but all of them is the same stupid thing. Another reason which should be early access, currently from my point of view, only allows for 15 - 20 hours of gameplay unless you planning on replaying the same content again and again or collecting better gear for your crew.I enjoyed the game in the first few hours but after realising the problems it has with the game and multiplayer, i find it hard to continue on anymore. Low fps should be fixed for a game like this, minimum system requirement is not at all accurate at all. Multiplayer should be in early access or beta testing as there's constant problems with online play.For now i can't really say i would recommend until most problems is fixed or patched. Looks like a fun concept but the co-op experience been awful so far.TLDR: Buy it if you're planning on playing it alone and doesn't mind constantly playing it like an ARPG. Multiplayer has a number of problems which would take away the enjoyment. Get starbound if you're looking for a similar game.UPDATE: I just realised that the gameplay is quite boring actually, the game has a element called RTS which makes you plan before making decisions and actions but so far it's worst than a ARPG. Constant spamming of right click, thats all. The more i think, the more flaws i find with the game. Honestly, even without the multiplayer problems, it should definitely be in early access.			"

												Loot/10Great game IMO. Been waiting for it for a while and I can't say it let me down.+ Loot amount. Greed: Satiated+ Item stat variety allows you to really customize your builds.+ There's a Horadric Cube that lets you turn loot into loot.+ There's a replicator that lets you dupe your loot in exchange for a generic resource.+ Gorgeous art, the environments are spectacular.+ Each of the 5 classes has multiple off-hand class items that changes up their role.+ The strange music in your ship's bar. I wish I had a reason to go there more often.+ NG+- Not a lot of unique events.- UI is pretty crappy. The most efficient (that I can see) way to use a non-selected privateer's ability is to select his icon with the mouse and then press the number of the skill on the keyboard. This is pretty clumsy. Will probably be improved. - Currently a bug that basically evacuates the galaxy when you hit lvl ~100- Ship encounters need some love and/or a reduction in frequency.- Not sure if everyone has this but I had some performance issues when running the game for long periods. Restarting the game fixes thisOverall I highly recommend. It's been a while since I marathoned a game for 17 hours in one day. The only reason I stopped when I did is because of the galactic evacuation bug, when that's fixed I'll come back for more. I'm pretty sure it's only going to get better from here.			"

												Running low on resources, use your cash to buy a huge bundle of matter, and then replicate it a couple of times.  Have a favorite squad member?  Clone him and replicate his items to give him a new best friend.Dive into dungeons to find great loot, fight bosses that require tactics, manage a squad of up to 8 members (which I normally can't stand but find it really enjoyable here).  Follow the story, or just explore planets, running into side missions and stash rooms on the way.This is probably the most interesting and fun game I've played in a long time, maybe ever. "

												Loot galore with charming graphics and sound (I actually love how this game looks, sounds and feels). A ton of micromanagement due to the amount of loot drops, since it takes quite a while to properly assign it to the squad members (less loot drops, but more meaningful would help a ton). Slow start without any tactics necessary, but a few hours in the possibilities to freeze combat and making sure that the squad members' equipment complements each other's start to make a lot of sense. The game made me giggle when I found an artifact weapon that obliterated everything for a few missions (slow firing, so I had enough time to watch the squad member and smirk while saying to myself ""And here it comes~""). Attentive dev team as it appears (thanks for the very recent possibility to deactivate the 3D UI by the way - looks swell, but felt unnecessary and even slightly obstructive). Very few path finding problems (nope, squad member #5, you should run with the others and not get stuck behind a rock. Where exactly are you anyways?). Ship invasions could be more meaningful instead of just a ""Run through every room in the ship and kill everything that spawns"" - that gets old fast.Over all, it's a ... cute ... and even pretty impressive ... game when it comes to its presentation. Mechanics need some slight adjustments but are already on a good way when it comes to flow. Designers and devs know what they're doing and I'd like to see more of that. Good job.			"

												Get ready to drop a bunch of time in this game because it is pretty fun.  Although there are a few game decisions that make me scratch my head...it still doesn't take away from the overall.Here's the good:Gameplay is simple and easy to understand.  After the Tutorial mission you'll be ready to rock. I personally recommend that you stick this on the hardcore mode even for your first playthough.  Sure you won't be able to use cloning but if you put this on normal mode and enable cloning, it makes the missions less intense. Loads of different loot and lots of fun possibilities such as having a % chance to summon a drone out to attack and Heal group when reloading.Maps and missions are all procedurally generated and the direction of corridors are always going to be different.Lots of nasty and nice surprises awaits.  You never know what the next room may bring as it could be a trap with loads of enemies or a room that will have a bunch of chests with fistfuls of money. Here's the bad:Your guys don't auto attack ... EVER.  Even if they are getting roflstomped. If you don't have your guy selected and you clicking on the bad guy to attack, he will stand there and get hit until he dies.  I understand that perhaps they shouldn't be shooting but IMO if they are getting hit, please shoot back!!If your inventory is full and goes to a 3rd or 4th storage and then you purchase a new ship.  You get to keep your storage room to build over to the next one, but it will be completely empty.  All of the stuff that was in it will disappear!If you are somehow acquire a new guy on a mission that makes your maximum go over the cap, you can't move until you disentegrate somebody.

												Its Good. Comabt is fun, the irandom loot system is decent. The active pause system is nice for when you crank up the difficulty and actually want to think about combat. On the other hand, why not let me set some basic passive orders? As far as I can tell, there isn't a way to set: ""attack enemy within x range, maintain x distance from enemies > y% hp. Target enemies < y% hp first, etc..."" if you just want to run through. Many times you can ignore more than half a planet and finish the quest, which I like. The rpg elements are fun.  Worth Playing, could be deeper... but, for me, I want $1 per hour of enjoyable gameplay. That's pretty much how I decide if a game was worth it... I probably hit that in 3 days before I started to get a little bored.The space combat needs an upgrade though... I wish this had some FTL style combat. I mean, the ships are already laid out in 2d style, why not have some better space battles as I travel around unexplored space?			"

												Pixel Privateers covers up its overly repetitive gameplay and basic dungeon crawling with annoying menus and a bad inventory management system. That is not to say the gameplay is not solid and the dungeon crawling is not entertaining. My main gripe here is - you will probably end up spending more time in the menus than actually dungeon crawling if you plan to fully loot a planet.I don't believe the mass amount of collectible loot is the issue with Pixel Privateers. If anything, it is the poor filtering and all-categories inventory that causes conflicts and frustrations. With the amount of stats and comparing among different alternatives and strategies when loading out characters, it becomes an issue of having to take time and examine the loot and see if it is worth keeping. The problem? The game uses a poorly developed storage system to filter and juggle the insane amount of loot and loadout upgrades. If the storage system is optimized, then the amount of time spent juggling the loot could be reduced, which means you can get back to the dungeon crawling - which I enjoy a good bit, personally.TL;DRConcept-wise, the game is solid and sticks to a simple, yet fun, formula. However, the inventory UI is lackluster and needs optimization.			"

												I've found a few glitches with the tutorial pop-ups being delayed/not popping up until you tab out and tab back in to a.. certain tab, but otherwise it's a very promising game! I'm not far into it of course, I hope it lives up to how much I actually enjoyed Pixel Piracy.The one thing that really nags me though is the combat system, I'd like it to more or less be an exact replica of Pixel Piracy. Groups with certain purposes at the top, perhaps via class with one main 'crew' tab. Also, pawns not automatically attacking enemies and just sitting there to take the damage is annoying.			"

												I am going to start by saying this, the game is fun, no denying that.But, there are a few problems...1. Too much loot. Each mission, I would have to change the entire gear of my 5 man team because I kept find better stuff.That doesn't make much sense, why bother creating a market if you are almost certain to find new and more powerful stuff during a mission...2. Too easy. I found out I could up the difficulty a notch, so I went and did that (added 10% ennemy HP), but I still managed to get through most mission or planet without a problems3. Too much cash. This is, somehow, slightly related to the first point. After 12, maybe 15 planets top, I ended up with around 70K... I managed to buy easily a 7 room ship and my crew was only level 15... I have to blame the reward system for mission, they sincerely give way too much cash. I only went to sell my stuff once, and that was when I had the said 70K in hand.4. Tutorial is lacking a bit. I believe the tutorial could be better, like to add how engineer can hack locked doors, something I learned on my own.5. Repetitive bases. You will often see the same type of layout in a base on a planet. It took me 5 planets to discover that bases could have stairs6. The stats when you level up. When you place your stats point after leveling up, it shows only the potential change AFTER you put the point in, not before. Also, if you place your last point in a stat, you wont be allowed to see what will be the change. This is a really minor thing.The fun stuff1. The story and it's caracters. The story is simple and yet I know there's a lot more in that game. More than only 2 hours of gameplay could allow me to see. The inhabitant of the universe are diverse and interesting. 2. The humour. There are some small joke here and there, to lighten up the fact that you are shooting the little hell out of critters and primitive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Its neat.3. The gameplay. The shooting/crew-based gameplay is well done.4. The small detail. The equipment your crew wears change how they look, which is nice.Overall, I would wait for you to buy the game, not until they update the game to address these issues...But dont take my words for cash, I am a picky S.O.B.

												I know they wanted to to play diffrently to pixel pirates but I really do believe it takes away some of the core aspects of good ol pixel piracy. In pixel privateers sometimes I don't even remember that I have a ship because you vist it so infrequently that the game feels like just a map and clicks every 20mintues after you suffocate under so much useless loot.The gameplay is fine but using abilities is just slow and feels so clunky. 5/10 It could be so much better :(			"

Product received for free
												An addictive Space Exploration RPG game where you explore Planets, fight various alien factions, and find equipment and upgrade your own Crew and Ship.I can attest that this game is addictive, and after heading onto your 1st Planet, the game will capture you. It's filled with humor, Cybernetic Spiders that spawn from explosions, and many items to discover and find. And more interesting suprises to explore. I'll try to compose the important points into a short list:The fun features-Randomized Planets to explore with every new Playthrough-5 Different Classes to assign to your crew members-The Freedom to use any of the classes you want to-Control up to 8 different crew members-Join with Friends as you explore the galaxy-Total freedom to explore the galaxy and take the game at your own pace-New Game+, continue with your previous crew in a new playthrough with all your current items.-Significant Weapon Variety. From Axes, swords, daggers, machine guns, and energy weapons and much more-An Extensive Research Tree to improve your crew, items, and ship features-Various Difficulty Settings to allow players to find their comfortable level of difficulty for the game. It can be very difficult or as easy as you want.-The game will continue to recieve free content updates from the Developers, further improving the experience!For $14.99, the game is well worth the price. You can take as much time as you want doing practically unlimited side quests before continuing the Story to fight bosses, or you can speedrun the game by defeating the bosses quickly, and a single playthrough will last anywhere from around 5-20+ hours. The thing is that you won't want to do just 1 playthrough. You'll want to play again, whether it's with your current crew in New Game +, or create a new crew with a whole new set of planets & locations.If RPGs and Space Exploration are your thing, you love finding items, and having to fight with multiple different groups/factions of enemies. This is the game for you!			"

												Have you ever played a game that you almost liked? Like, it was right on the cusp of making you say 'This is great!', but there are just too many niggling issues that make you wand to punch a hole through your monitor?That's how I feel about Pixel Privateers.Do not get me wrong, this is by no means a 'bad' game. There is plenty to like, but every positive point is marred by one or two little things that are insignificant on their own, but slowly add up. Let's go ahead and dig in...1. Way too many menus. There's a menu for crew members. There's a member for leveling them up. There's a menu for 'research'. There's a menu for loot. There's a menu, for menus... I spent more time in the menus than I did playing the actual game.2. Auto-Attack, what's that? As many have pointed out before, crewmembers do not attack automatically when an enemy is attacking them or other crewmates. I didn't realize this at first, so I ended up with this rather confusing situation where I was running around with an almost dead engineer as the rest of the team just stared at him, all the while some monster was trying to eat his face...3. Clutter, clutter, everywhere. The idea of a looter is to collect loot, I know this. But, I feel, there is such a thing as too much loot, especially if it's boring. In my admittedly short time of playing, I didn't find a single interesting weapon or piece of armor... Nothing but slightly improved stats, and higher grade loot needs to be identified before you can use it, which means spending more time in menus. Oh, and any fuel that you pick up isn't automatically added to your tank, you are forced to convert it from a menu... And inventory space is extremely limited early on.4. Matter and Fuel, the most boring, but important things ever. Both of these resources are extremely important, and for the time I played, my entire time was sitting there worrying if I had enough of both. Without fuel, you ain't going nowhere, and without matter, you can't do missions, clone dead troopers, nothin'... So, I spent of my game staring at menus, feeding these two resources the majority of my loot.5. Trying to be tactical is a hassle. Each crewmember, depending on what kind of tool their wielding, has a small action bar with some useful abilities on it. These can be critical to mission success and survival, especially in difficult missions... So why do they make it so damned hard to use them? In order to use a skill, you must first select the appropriate crewmember with your mouse, then click on the skill. Doesn't sound too difficult, but in the thick of a fight it can damned near impossible to click on the correct tiny pixel outline to deploy the right ability.If a few of these problems were fixed, I would have no problem recommending this game, but in its current state, I'd say give it a pass unless the premise really captures your interest.

												Was very excited that this game was released and was an instant buy for me.Have been playing it for a little while, but it can't keep me interested.- repetitive gameplay;- Character layout comparison is a pain;- Checking all items on chars vs new items in inventory is a no go;- After each planet/mission the actions to be taken to clear all out takes too much time;The game does look goed though graphic wise, but I rather have good gameplay over graphics.I will probably not buy anything in this genre again.

												Incredibly good surprise !A great game that is obviously under the radar at the minute.A very neat mix of - Diablo's loot system- MMORPG in the sense that you will own your own group of privateers and will have to compose a balanced team with a tank, DPS, support, Heal but it's litteraly up to you to do whatever you want.- Pixels art with very modern effects on top- the Soundtrack is awesome. Between the silly songs in the background or the punchy musics. I enjoyed a lot that- Kind of rogue like too cause you ll explore the galaxy, planet by planet but beware that you fuel doesn't run out.- Well thought research point system where you drop items that you study and earn points to unluck your skill tree- An easy duplication when you want to equip all your team with that finest perfect loot you just found- Multiplayer up to 4 players - No competition on the loot !- Upgradable and visitable ship- Markets- Redraw your loot with special artifactsThe only con would be that you'll have an incredible amount of loot and just dealing with that can really take some time. but fun to do anyway.No really, this should be a reference game !

												Bought for me and a couple friends. We are all enjoying it. The pixel art is awesome.If you like a roguelike experience I highly reccomend.edit1. People who are saying game is not hard are playing on easy mode. You can set it to hardcore for a roguelike experience. You can also set the difficulty on each planet before landing to increase loot value. One mistake means you lose everything or over half your crew. I have had to start over about 6 times already from not winning fights.2.  ""having to manually click is so annoying. They need auto attack."". You would not want to auto attack in this game because it would get your people killed too easily. if you are having a problem keeping up you can push space bar to pause the combat and order your units around.3.  And then the ""too much loot"".. Again they are playing on easy mode and yeah its ♥♥♥♥ing easy because you are playing on easy mode. bump up your difficulty. On higher difficulty stronger monsters spawn in.			"

												This is an odd one... pixel privateers is a looker, it's probably the best looking retrostyle game i've ever played, the graphics are gorgeous and it didnt have a single bug the entire time i played it.The problem is, it is very dull. As flashy as the first time playing was, you very soon get the impression that the game is going nowhere. Sure you can upgrade your ship, but i don't really get a connection to that as you clear planet after planet in the same fashion: teleport, fight, equip, teleport, maybe get intercepted, defend ship, return to mainscreen, teleport.Most levels can be cleared without using a single ability, in that sense it's a relaxing game. Something i don't look for at all here... everything is just very disconnected.You gather humongous amounts of loot and compare them to your current gear but there's hardly any decisions you have to make here or during the game so at some point i stopped even picking the stuff up.Oh and if you play on hard it might happen because you fell almost asleep that there is suddenly a very hard pod of enemies wiping your whole crew. If you play the game on hard because you like a challenge that means everything is gone and you might as well restart.Here's the problem with that, i like hard games and i even like roguelikes, but only if they keep me on my toes. This game lulled me to sleep and then whacked me suddenly once over the head. Not really fun or challenging - also feels like a permadeath mode in a simple game like this is out of place.I can't recommend this as it is clearly not for me. But i guess if you like gathering all kinds of random items and just have a chill experience and not think to much, by all means get it and play it on normal so you can clone your dead people back. Don't expect a challenge though (even if you up the difficulty).5.5 / 10			"

												Has a bit of a learning curve. Not because its so complex but because there are so many things going on at once in the menus. So it will probably take you a few hours to get the hang of it.  The tutorial is pretty decent to get you started, but it still skips explaining a few things and youre left to figure them out on your own. For example how to get fuel.Basically to find fuel you can either get it as a reward for doing missions, or you can find it on planets. Also you can replicate it once you have one using the replicator and each time it costs matter. Its really a fun little game and pretty much what i was expecting. The only thing thats a little overwhelming is having to constantly sort through loot like most action RPGs but this itme instead of one character you have a whole team of them to gear up. So that can get a little tedious. Also there doesnt seem to be anyway to customize the text size or UI which i hope they add in the future. But for what it is and the price, this is an excellent game and well worth the cost. Have really enjoyed what ive played of it so far. Its pretty addictive lol.			"

The dev team is really dedicated to making this game a fun and worthwhile experience. I hope everyone has as good a time with it as I have been. They've worked so hard and made such an enjoyable game I went ahead and bought it to support the team despite being offered a free copy for having been part of the testgroup.

												Looking forward for extra contents from Re-Logic. Good game. I will recommend to anyone who love WOW raids or rift type of games. Is it flawless? No. Only 5 characters can be used in current time, and it only have 3 game modes, raid, intruder from space, and defending the mining mahcine. You will get bored very easy if you do not increase the difficulty. Even you do increase it, the game seems to be monotony, with limit weapons and gears, and imbalance characters build. And it doesnt give you the feeling of exploring outer space, more like clicking, loot-based stimulator.But I have faith on the company behind this game. Re-Logic will give gamers extra contents (Like Terraria 1.3), and fulfill this Pixel space with more alien type and gears. Overall, its a good game with few flaw spots.			"

												This basically felt like pixel piracy but with a space theme tacked on.There is too many issues with this game right that just make it frustrating to play rather than enjoyable. Underneath all these glaring problems is a good game though.1. Too much loot, you spend a while sorting out all of your loot after every mission. Only for it to become clustered again after the next mission. The time between missions is also too great because of all the stuff you have to do to sort your inventory out.2. No auto attack. Your landing party will just stand there unless you tell it to attack. Once the enemy is dead they will just stand there once again until you tell them to attack the next enemy.3. Tactical mode is nice. It is however the only way you can have all your crew use their special abilities before the fight is over. Using abilities is extremely tedious and unconventional when in the heat of a battle due to how difficult it is to actually get one of your crew members to use one. By which time the fight is over anyway. Tactical mode is also ruined by the fact that your crew members will not continue their attack on the enemy you have told them to use their ability on.4. Loot progresses way too fast. They seem to double in stats every mission (not sure if this slows down later on though).All these issues make the game a slog to play rather than a joy. Once they have been fixed  (such as easier crew selection during a fight) then it will be much better as the underlying game is great. For now I cannot recommend this.			"

												Wow. I thought I Was going to hate this game, and I can really understand why some will. This is not everyone's cup of tea. First thing first, I came in to this with no expectations, And no research on it, SO i was suprised with it. Also  I only played with a full group of dedicated friends, And Im certain this enhances the experience as we discover and discuss everything togheter, And we bring crew members that we build to support eachother and make nice combos. First let's talk about the good things. - Combat looks visually nice, Everything has this bit graphic to it but still you can clearly see what is what and there's an interesting artwork and visual layout on planets and ships so far. - Customisation, There's a ton of weapons outfits that looks nice and feel nice to use. You can make some interesting characters. You can't change body appearence but you can rename them. yet there armor covers most of them so it don't matter. - The story, Wow.. It's so simple but somehow it keept me interested, As It's all random generated on where things happen it feelt nice whenever we found a base belonging to one of the antagonist and small dialogues broke out where we could vote on our responses as a group. There's also a pause of 10 sec in each part in the dialogues so if someone tries to skip it you still get 10-15 sec to finish reading it. It jumps only when everyone skips it. - Gear, Holy crap there's allot of them, weapons armors, tech. Allot to find and use. - Random encounters and Cameos. Damm we fought a race based on SLENDER MAN!! WTf? Awesome but wtf?-Cameos, As a Sci-FI fan you will see Star trek, Star wars, Stargate and many other cameos return for you to laugh at. They are more but Thos are things that stood out to me. Bad stuff?- It get's repedetiv quick and sometime you can go through many planets without anything interesting happening and all you do is kill enemies. I can see that becoming boring.- Combat, It's well It's ok but theres only 5 classes with 3 abillities each and as a 4 player group we got 2 characters each. thats 6 abillities. Sure there are talents, Stats, Special gear with active functions and Tech to develop that give you more to do but in terms of tactic there's not much but SHOOT ( Click on ) Everything until it's dead. - Story, It has it's weak part and can come off as pretty poor and obvious at some points. -  It takes it self a bit to unserious, I guess some will love that but It breaks immersion more then i would like. Verdict: Recommended = I think this is a good game so far, My opinion may change as i dig deeper in to it. But I can see many people with a good group of friends enjoying this. It's very casual to play. It keept me going so far. I fear it may get repedetiv and that you won't advance with such interest to keep one coming back for more. But so far It has not had that problem. This will not be a game for everyone And If your planning to go Solo I would not myself, As that would get boring quick. But hey.. Try yourself. 2 hours is more then enough to get a feel of the game and the price tag is not so high. What will you do?			"

												Pixal Privateers. I love the Pixel Artstyle thus far, the way things glow and the User Interface is stunning. Great inventory mechanics and looting options. Can't wait to play more, I'll update this review in a week or so. Thus far I recommend it! This is what happens when devs get the time they need to develop a game before releasing a pre-alpha. More of the ""when it's ready"" mentality. Very polished!--------------------------------------------------[Update 1]     About 10 hours in and still stand by what I said. Thus far The inventory, mass, and fuel systems are very polished. and the missions you go on just don't seem to get stale. There's always something on the planet that makes you smile or think about how you want to proceed. The Loot:     At first glance I was going to say that I ""think the loot style to be like Diablo"" - however, I find it much more accurate to say that the loot in this game is far more similar to games like Borderlands with random properties, damage types, common, uncommon, rare, Legendary, Ancient - It's great! And the time-intervals in which you find Legendary or Ancient weapons is very well spaced out, it doesn't make you ever feel ""OP"" by dropping tons, but just enough to keep you above the edge at most times.     The loot mechanics and style in this game has varying *damage types* (just like in borderlands), ranges, cooldown rate, reload time, magazine size, and even a physical 'weight' attribute which gives incentive for light-armor style classes to throw a few spare points into Strength(increasing that Privateer's carry capacity) for the purpose of carrying perhaps heavier gear or 2-handed weapons.----- That ends Update 1 -----     I'll try and give a more in depth review in regards to ""Quality of Life"" aspects of the game in my next update. I'm still recommending this game highly especially with the gracious price tag of $15. :)			"

												The game still has way too many problems in the current state to be considered a full release. For one, it makes my GTX 1080 sweat at above 70% usage just in the menus. There are also countless bugs in the game. The gameplay itself becomes very repetitive, with hardly any difference in room after room of mobs. The game is also horribly unbalanced- in early game I am afraid of increasing difficulty because I go from wrecking everything to getting demolished. Mid-game and onward it is always very easy unless you purposely choose bad weapons/setups. At level 40 and onwards I p[played at max difficulty and I didn't even use any abilities to crush all mobs.			"

You get way too many items with few options to sort them, it is really tedious. There is no auto-combat, you have to manually click enemies, and using abilities is annoying and there are very few abilities to use.

												The reviews for this must be based on nostalgia or promises not yet kept.  The game is incredibly 1 dimensional and a repetitive stress injury waiting to happen.  All of the gear, monsters, levels, etc. are exactly the same.  Everything scales as well, so if you can't beat a boss, don't go try and out level it, quite often they'll actually get more difficult.  The game is very simple, even at the highest difficulty.  The last 3 bosses are purely tank and spank fights that are the most disappointing aspects of this game.It has promise, but until there are some patches, I would avoid this game.			"

												I'm having a lot of fun with this one. I love going through huge piles of loot after a mission and picking out the best upgrades for my team. Some people find this tedious (in which case this may not be the game for you) but there is the ability to sort by type or quality and a ""sell all"" button in the marketplace to help get through it quicker. There are 5 classes and each has a variety of tools they can pick from which can change their function. Add to this the science lab tech tree and there's plenty of variety in how you build your team. There are multiple levels of difficulty to choose from and even optional permadeath if that's your thing.I adore the pixel art and have been happily wandering the galaxy for many hours now. I should probably get back to the main quest line at some point....			"

												This is a very fun and simplistic game. I seen videos of gameplay before release and have to say it was worth it. Art style is amazing. I would gladly recommend this to anyone. Just keep in mind, it's not a 10/10 because every game has its issue. For example:The clutter, especially when you get swam by mobs of enemy and loot. Can get really crazy when you're not sure if you're clicking on an enemy or an item drop.The menu can be more simplify. Though it's not complex to navigate it can get annoying when majority of your time is spent on going from one tab to another just to level, equip, research and deck out your crew.Also some graphics issue if you play for long periods of time and from the looks of the other reviews seem to be a common trend.

 Pro's -Plenty of fun alone or with friends-You get plenty of loot (Better and worse)-Lovely soundtrack-Posibility to change the dificulty for each mission-Good amount of upgrades for the ship-Funny little easter egg's-Good value for relatively low price Con's -Occasional fps drops (might be just my pooish pc)-Random crashing mid boss fights (multiplayer)-Some desync issues (multiplayer)-Sometimes units become unresponsive (even when not under effects of debuffs)7/10Overall the game is really promising even at this stage and hope the Dev's keep pushing out patches and general updates to keep people hooked on the game.

												Repetitive gameplay and not really much fun after an hour.  As battles get more participants, it gets difficult to micromanage a battle.  Loot is random and filled with garbage, and it takes a long time to go through your loot after ever battle looking for something that makes in incremental increase in your stats.  You don't even really know what impact the new weapon or item had on your gameplay.			"

												Pixel Privateers may look like another game with pixels, but it has it's charm and it is addicting, with how everything works, how the different classes play out and difficulty you decide to go on, you'll love Pixel Privateers. And Hardcore gamers will be happy as this game has a permadeath mode where if a crew member dies, they die for good. The interface may seem intimidating but as you play along, you'll start to know more about it and get better at it. If anyone wants a RPG Strategy game, why not give Pixel Privateers a shot			"

												Fun little game, pretty simple setup that works very addicting. Although you can set the difficulty level yourself, the game never gets really challenging. It's also very short, I finished it in about 14 hours,  which is about ~$1 per hour, which is decent for an indie game.All in all: I would recommend this game.			"

												Going to recomend this because despite some big issues this game still manages to be enjoyable and memorable.The Good:Big Party Tactics:8 per raid team squad action in RTS works better here than anywhere else I have seen. I found they got the right mix of chaos with planned action and the controls are simple and intuitive. Their are tons of different setups for each class and playing around with them is the highlight of the game. Micromanagment in battles is actually pretty minimal which is a rarity for RTS games in my experience.Well-Balanced:No explanation needed here.Pixel Art: Done well IMO so plus there if that's your thing.Fun: It just kinda is and if your on the fence you will likely get a feel for everything this game has to offer after playing it for an hour or so.The big issues:Too much loot: Yes, even for a loot em' up it's just far too much to handle. Inventory managment is a chore that seems to grow exponetially as you progress which could have been helped with some more decent sorting or autotrashing options. The sheer number of items you come across means that even when you do wind up with a legendary or artifact class item the joy of it's discovery starts to get lost in the shuffle of shuffling everything on everyone all the time.Too few actived abilities: The ones that are here are well thought out and somewhat interesting but the novelty wears off by the time you have raided your thirty mission spamming the same activable abilities over and over. For as many options for different setups and passives (which are nice and definitely on the plus side) it's too bad they didn't extend the same to activables.Like most RTS games micromanagment is a big part of this game and the inventory overload issue means that goes about 2x here. It feels like the research portion of the game could have been fleshed out a little better. All researchable items seem to be and do the same thing and it feels like there was alot more they could have done to add depth to this mechanic while also keeping the ratio of indistinguishable/unusable loot to usable/interesting loot more agreeable.Conclusion: 6/10Pretty solid game that could have been really good with a few changes (although probably major ones that would have been time consuming to implement). If there's a Pixel Privateers 2 somewhere down the line I will be stoked because there's a great framework in place here. "

												Privateers is a lot of fun! Only if you're interested in learning how to micro manage if playing solo, The team aspect I haven't had enough time in to really say how well it is. Overall the game is very in depth and has lots of choices to make, nearly endless possibilities for sure! There are a few weird aspects that people may have troubles with, like slanted menus, or randomly finicky controls at times. if playing solo the best aspect seems to play with a Squad of 3-5, any more and it starts getting harder to manage unless you utilize Tactic mode which is a mode they provide that allows you to Pause, state commands, then unpause. It kinda reminds me of Front mission 3. If any of you remember that game for playstation®. I've been following this game since shortly after it was announced and had been anxious for it since. I'm glad they put as much effort into the various aspects of the game from modding your ship, to naming your characters, To being able to overpower or underpower levels they have a lot of variables the user can add to make the game exactly to their liking/Difficulty. $15 Is a reasonable price for all the work they put into it, but I wouldn't want to pay more either. If you don't see yourself spending hours sinking yourself into a game that greatly requires a unique learning curve to adopt you may want to hope for a free week to try it out first.If you have a friend or two who already have it try getting them to let you watch it played via Steam Stream. It's a good way to see if you'd enjoy it or not you can also ask them questions via their broadcast. The game is most likely going to be more fun in a group even if with 1 other person than solo but I still have immense fun playing solo!			"

												I bought this on a whim because it is published by Re-Logic, the team that made Terraria. They've garnered enough goodwill from me to grab anything with their name attached to it. I'd never heard of the developer Quadro Delta but Re-Logic vouching for them was enough for me to take the risk sight unseen.That said, I am absolutely loving the game right now. It's really scratching the itch that I've had for a loot-based game lately. It's a side scrolling, ""dungeon"" crawling, squad-based, loot grinder. You get up to 8 characters in a team, and run across the surfaces of worlds clearing out the baddies and grabbing piles of loot. At the start I thought there was a possibility that the combat would feel shallow, but as I've progressed through the game and unlocked more skills and tech, the difficulty has really picked up. First, I love the contextual queues for using abilities popping up over squad members in trouble. Each character has around 5 abilities with a variety of effects. That seemed pretty overwhelming for how fast combat moves, but when characters hit low health or have certain status effects, the relevant abilities from all of the squad pop up as action buttons above that character. For example: Someone drops below 50% health, the medic's abilities, the mercenary's heal, and the scout's smoke bomb pop up as abilities to cast at that target. It really streamlines combat to the point that you don't have to frequently pause it and queue up abilities.Second, the loot is incredibly varied. I have started to get a bit of loot fatigue. It is beneficial to pick up every single piece and disintegrate it for ""matter"" which is used for a variety of things, but there is just so much of it sometimes that it gets to be a bit much. I've started to only identify and manage purple-quality and higher loot. You also eventually find a combining cube (think Diablo 2 Heraldric Cube) that lets you do some re-rolling of items and stats.Third, the worlds all seem varied enough for the 8 or so hours I've played so far. There have been a few occasions of things feeling a little same-y, but the random generation of NPCs and such has helped to diminish that. I've also stumbled across a few interactable elements that end up spawning waves of enemies and give great loot. That has been nice.So far, what I have played feels like a full game. I get the feeling, though, that as I play I'm going to continue finding new elements and content that will add to the game. I've not had the opportunity to build or upgrade my ship yet. I've not had a boarding party show up while in flight. There are things I know I haven't encountered but already feel satisfied with the amount of content available.If you enjoy looking through loot drops, min/maxing stats, squad combat, and mostly-funny dialogue, you should be happy with this. Especially considering the price of entry.			"

												As a huge fan of Pixel Pirates, I went ahead and bought this game. I wasn't too sure about the style at first, but as I got used to it, I got sucked in and put nearly 7 hours into by accident. It's a pretty amazing game! The music can be a bit laggy during loading screens, but that's okay with me.It's quirky in a good way and has a lot of references to Pixel Pirates as well. Which is pretty awesome!If you're looking for a great game, get this one. $15 is an amazing price for this game!			"

And the music, is like listening to Alvin and the chipmunks... But oh so much better. So far i've gotten to level 30 on my characters, and I have to say there feels as if there's so much more content to be played. It made me stay up to late too say the least, I blame the borderlandish feel of looting it has to offer.Will be dumping more countless hours into this well thought out game.I regret nothing, just the lack of sleep i'm going to get.  10/10			"

												For the price this game is definitely worth it! Granted I don't have a lot of time put into this game yet but so far I am having a lot of fun with it. You start off with a small squad exploring the galaxy for the Company. Looting and exploring planets and what have you. Everything you find gets sent back to your ship awaiting your return once youre done clearing the planet or until you die. Once youre back on your ship you can level up your characters, research new skills/items and upgrade your gear. Then off to a new planet you go! The loot system is probably the best part, it is similar to Diablo 3 or Borderlands in that way. (TONS OF LOOT) There seem to be quite a few different enviroments and enemies as well. The level and skill tree progression has some depth but it's a little on the light side compared to some RPGs. I wil update as I get further into it. PROS:Fun to play and grind.Visually appealing imo.Tons of loot.Just enough depth.CONS:Combat can be wonky.			"

Ended up playing it for 9 hours straight and having some of the most fun loot hunting I've had since Diablo 2.My only suggestion is to play on hardcore / ironman mode or there really isn't a whole lot of tension. In regular mode when crew die you can revive or clone them. No such luck with ironman mode where you'll have to make tough decisions instead of just facerolling your way through.			"

												Gameplay:Very satisfactory game to begin with and i liked the experience, that is until i hit a supposed max level of 100. After level 100 enemies bug out and dissapear, items scale is completely messed up. Item drops with +100% damage reductions basically making you 100% invulnerable. If you overlook the blatant bugs and issues with the game and look purely at the gameplay and content itself. There isn't really much to come for. The quests is pretty much the same 3-4 experiences over and over again on each seperate planet you visit. While it is fun to begin with it quickly gets tiresome as there is no kind of diversity in the quests.You can maybe get around 15-20 hours of gameplay out of the game. But that is it. If you level too high you are out of luck and cannot play anymore.I really want to like the game, however as it stands right now it is completely bug ridden at higher levels.Performance:There has been no crashes in the roughly 18 hours of gameplay i have had so far, BUT and there is a but i have had issues with framedrops after playing for a while, prompting a restart of the game to fix the issue. They occured for me roughly 3-4 times within a 2 hour span of playing which is unacceptable. Would i recommend it? Definitely not as it is right now. It feels like an early access game and should not have been released in it's current state. My suggestion is to wait a few months. It definately has a potential to be a fun game if it is worked on and more content is implemented. But until they add more content and fix the huge glaring issues i will not be playing it again.			"

												Negatives:* Numbers and reading overload* Massive amounts of ""logistics"" between bouts of action* Extremely limited variety of worlds and missions* UI is too clumsy and pacing is too fast for effective tacticsPositives:* Fun art style, music, and humor* Easy to learn game, effective tutorial if you want itInitially it looks like this is going to be a massive game with deep customization possibilities and character progression and suchforth and so on... but really it just gets very repetitive very quickly because there's only a handful of art sets and objectives to draw from.  Privateers tries to mix it up with a story but so far it feels very basic. There's some occasional random encounters which are cute, but ultimately the uniqueness only lasts a few seconds and then you're back into the same ""Go there, collect 5 of that"" missions you were already doing. It's a game that makes a fabulous first impression but then realize it's got a plethora of issues as you invest more time.A typical mission involves 10 minutes carefully analyzing your loot trying to make sure that your entire team is equipped as well as possible, assigning skill points, and reading about research.  I really hope you like comparing pages of small numbers. Then you deploy to the planet, and it's a few minutes of rolling your mob of guns from left to right (sometimes right to left) and enemies falling over in front of you. You pick up all the junk that was dropped, then it's back to the ship for some more loot analysis.While ""kill, loot, kill more, loot more"" is indeed the core premise of games like Diablo or Borderlands, the big difference here is that Privateers basically doesn't require you to actually do anything subtle or fancy or skillful to get through. Which is just as well because you have an entire squad of people that you're trying to control, constantly getting stacked on top of eachother and no really good way to check the tactical situation. It's very much a case of building the best horde you can and throwing it at the enemy horde, and maybe getting slightly interested if the enemy horde doesn't die instantly. There's only two fights I can remember where I really had to stop and try to figure out what was going on, and there was no leadup or story or anything involved; just random bad luck getting some enemies that synergized well with eachother, and the resulting ball of chaos because precise placement of units or seeing individual attacks and effects is impossible.Privateers basically reached a fork in the design road and tried to go both ways at once. If you want a deep squad tactical experience, you need to give the player more precision and more tools. Things like a grid system for movement, zones of control, cover, a combat log, or even going turn based.  Versus, if you want a light fast action experience, then you need to cut 3/4 of the ""logistics"" phase between missions and give players more immediate control over fewer and more interactive characters.  In its current form Privateers either has way too much prep time for its barely-controllable storm of bullets, or way too little player control for its tactical ambitions.			"

												I was looking forward to this game for many, many months following its announcement. The time I did spend playing Pixel Piracy, I really enjoyed it. So I thought, hey, the same sort of thing in space? Sounds great to me! Pixel Privateers is half of what Pixel Piracy was, while also being a lot more. In fact, Pixel Privateers is so much more than Pixel Piracy that it is actually bad for the game in my opinion.Simply put, Pixel Privateers is basically Pixel Piracy in space with a 20x multiplier on the ""what's going on"" factor.Pixel Privateers requires a massive amount of micromanagement due to the lack of any automation. Crew members do not attack anything automatically, requiring the player to right-click on every enemy to attack. Skills must be used manually, which is impractical for a few reasons.I played Pixel Privateers only with my girlfriend, with four crew members each. This means a total of eight characters milling around, making it difficult to tell who is doing what and where at any given moment. Even when I had two crew members and she had three, it was difficult to sort through our crew members for our own characters. When in combat, it is especially difficult to see through the pixels flying. Next think we know, we're just sitting there doing nothing while being pummelled by enemies because we can't tell who is attacking what. With no auto-attack, this becomes frustrating and irritating quickly.Because of the difficulty of telling what's going on or where our characters are, it can be difficult to select just one specific crew member to tell it to attack a specific target.There are also some things that are left unexplained. In the science lab, there are icons for each class next to some of the tech (I don't remember what it's called). But then there are other strange icons which are not explained. Some look like guns, some look like toolboxes, some look like... I don't even know what... But none of these extra icons are explained.The extensive tutorial is great, but it is a lot of reading. I personally can't stand long-winded tutorials. It probably took a half hour just for reading in the tutorial. The end of the tutorial was also confusing. I finished the advanced training, and the game told me I finished the tutorial. So when I clicked Main Menu to go back to the main menu to check out how the multiplayer works (more on that shortly), it told me I was leaving the tutorial and something else that I didn't quite get to read before I hit yes/ok. I loaded my save again to see if anything was lost, and I was greeted with a questionnaire similar to the one from Pixel Piracy. Everything was fine, but the message that popped up before I went back to the main menu lead me to believe I had lost all of my progress from the tutorial.Now the multiplayer woes. The process of playing multiplayer is not very intuitive. It was not apparent (to me, anyway) that you had to be in-game (not at the main menu) for a friend to join you. There is no ""host"" button anywhere. My girlfriend and I spent a good 10 or 15 minutes trying to figure out why she couldn't join my game while I was playing.It turns out, the ""friends, invite only"" online mode simply doesn't work. There is no way to invite a friend to play with you. Using the Steam overlay, or accessing the friends list from the main Steam interface, does not offer an ""invite to game"" option for friends, so the ""invite only"" mode is utterly pointless. Even if I set the online mode to the friends option that's not invite only, I don't have the option to invite a friend to the game until someone joins my game from the Multiplayer section of the main menu. Again, the invite function is utterly pointless as it doesn't exist until someone is in your game.My girlfriend and I ultimately ended up requesting a refund for the game. I really wanted to enjoy this game, but I simply cannot. We spent the majority of our time with the game managing our inventories, selling/destroying items, training crew, messing about in the science lab, trying to figure out this that and the other thing... Basically everything except actually playing the game. Perhaps we'll check it out again in the future after it has had some updates and polish, but for now, our collective $24 could be spent better elsewhere.			"

												I played this game for about 7 hours now and I have to say the game is beautiful and definitely stands out from the rest of your casual loot em up games.Pros:- The soundtrack is beautiful, the action theme never seems to get old- The missions, distress signals and main quests are really well designed- The abilities are responsive and well done- DPS / Heal counter for each unit- Lots of loot, some find it as a con but if you have fun with a lot of customisation this game is definitely for you!- Pixel art and particles look absolutely stunning!- Amazing devsCons:- The abilities are a bit hard to manage across 8 units, having to scroll through them gets quite confusing in-battle- Sometimes I can't attack enemy minions. I don't know if i triggered a feature or a bugOverall I'll give it a solid 8/10! So far I have really enjoyed my time and I am certain the developers will deliver game changing updates in the future			"

												This is effectively a squad based Borderlands. You go to an area, kill some guys, complete some objectives, collect lots of loot and then spend 10 minutes looking through the loot and crafting the perfect combination of crewman for your next adventure where it all starts over again.There is a lot more to it (much that I haven't even seen) but even just what I listed above is enough to make me love this game. I love finding loot and crunching the numbers to find a synergies and making the perfect squad.If you love loot, you'll love this game.			"

												This IS the 1st game i have completed in ages!!since about 2015, all the games i have played are open ended, non-ending sandbox games,this game has a Simple Easy-To-Follow campaign, which is great!The writeing is pretty great too! i had a few laughs when looking for annomolys (yea spelling sucks)Combat was fast, (besides bosses, which is good) so combat never seemed to drag on, though i never really used any of the consumeables, i still got buy every level, only having a full team wipe on a boss.The enemies level scales to yours, so you can go and explore any level you want without worry of danger!The game is also fairly endless, but the story loops, i stopped playing after the 1st loops, but i hope to play again with friends.I would reccomend this game!-Fun Combat-Ship Development is simple!?-Planets look great-Combat is fast and cool-If exploring gets samey, just rush the story, its not hard!-Defence Sidequest was fun (yay fuel too!)-Never truely stuck without direction8.5/10!

												I picked up this game on a whim after reading a couple reviews and because I just felt the need for something different and new. 9 hours later of solid play, the only reason I put the game down after that first session was because I needed sleep.The game has a variable pace, which is nice. What I mean by that is while you are on missions the pace can be kind of fast, but you can take little breaks between fights and you have the option to fight in real time or use a tactical pause to make combat a lot slower but more interesting than just run and gun. Then when you are off mission its basically turn based and you can slow down and take all the time you want. Which is a good thing because there is a LOT to do when not doing away missions. Researching loot and artifacts, spending that research on tech to enhance your ship or your team, going through all your loot to max your teams abilities, exploring the galaxy, browseing different markets on stations, the list goes on.Class variance feels solid and the clases themselves have enough variance within them depending on what class equipment you have on that its almost like sub classes. Vanguard for example, the idea of the class is to tank and take damage and agro off the rest of the team. Depending on the equipment you have installed you can either be a power armor charger with a hard hitting melee weapon, or you can have different shield abilities and use ranged weapons... lots of options like this for all the classes so you really can built a team to be how ever you want. And classes are changable on the fly. The only thing that holds you back a little are the attributes on your characters. If you build someone as a high STR melee character, you could give them the Scout class (sniper) but it wouldnt really be efficient.There is a ton more to this game, I couldnt go in to it all without writting a small book. The game is constantly giving me new and interesting things to play with. The current price of this game was well worth it since I am 9 hours in and still loving it.			"

												You take command of a rag-tag group of space mercs whose sole purpose in life is to explore wormholes, encounter aliens, and then blast those aliens into gooey bits so that you can collect loot and research materials.  Oh, and it's all presented in super stylish 2D art!  All in all, this game is worth the price of admission.  For the curious, take a look at this video which shows part of the tutorial and two planet-side missions: 


YouTube™ Video: Schwable Co - Let's Play Pixel Privateers - Episode 1 - Pixel Privateers Gameplay - Pixel Privateers 

			Views: 1,142		

			Come ride with a rag-tag group of mercenaries as they journey through a wormhole, fight cyborgs, and collect sweet loot!		

Once I got past the initial premise and glossy presentation, I was pleasantly surprised to find a relatively deep simulation/RPG game that has you manage everything from your ship's fuel and ""mass"" (necessary to teleport your squad and to manufacture items through replication) to your crew's equipment, skills, and attributes.The combat, as I mentioned above, is snappy and very pretty to watch, with particle effects going off in every direction.  The only downside is that your squadees don't seem to auto-target opponents, which requires a heavy amount amount of micromanagement during combat (and sometimes makes it difficult to multi-task).The graphics, as you would expect, are 2D/sprite-based with flashy particle effects.  The worlds are beautiful, with lovingly crafted buildings and environments that are mysterious enough for me to want to know more (e.g., what the heck is those ominous ruins).Overall, I really enjoy Pixel Privateers.  It's still unclear just how I'll fit into my gaming rotation--whether it'll be a staple that I sink endless hours into or whether it'll be something I play to unwind for a little bit--but it definitely won't go neglected!

												Pixel Privateers mixes wow, diablo and borderlands in a 2D-shooter.It's one of the games I've liked the most lately.However it does feel a bit incomplete. The game has more potential and an expansion pack would be really cool. What the game has to offer is good and well made but it's kind of short. I didn't mind the length I thought it was good enough for me. There could be so much to explore in the game mechanics and it could be a really awesome game. Right now it's worth the money and a nice experience but it's no legendary.8½/10			"

Great game if you like to micromanage your team.

												Had it on my wish list for a long time and was excited to play the game once it finally came out. It's an OK game. The artwork is great and I had fun working my way through the planets and leveling my squad up, but it became very repetitive pretty quick. I didn't see a whole lot of difficulty either once I had some nice weapons on a few characters and they would just dominate everything. Trying to micromanage your squad and their abilities was more work than I would have liked. I think I just focused on 2 of my guys to help produce some burst damage when I needed it. Having the engineer to unlock doors only to get some crappy items felt worthless, so I never picked the engineer. Tank, assualt, sniper and medic, thats all you need to plow through the levels. Also, there were a few instances where I was unable to attack anything. And it happened during a boss fight so we just had to sit there and let the boss kill us because we were unable to attack it.

												Wow. So this game really filled a niche I didn't even know I needed filled (phrasing). I love this game. It has hilarious callbacks and references to other geek culture things without being hamfisted about it, and a lot of the references are subtle enough that I barely caught them. The gameplay is super tight, it has what I could call a couple of quirks (switching to a character to adjust a skill by using one of your F keys makes you lose control over the other chars in your party until you reselect them) but I am almost positive that it's just me being bad at the game, honestly. The inclusion of a tactical planning mode makes it much easier to juggle having a big roster in your landing party. The graphics are super presh. The characters, even the bad guys, are pretty adorable, and it almost (ALMOST) makes me feel bad when I nuke them off the face of the planet we are landed on. Multiplayer is a thing of beauty, a couple of friends played with me for the majority of my playtime thus far, and it has been an absolute delight having similarly like-minded folks trying to tactically plan our raids, to maximize loot while minimizing deaths. A couple of friends complained of sync issues, but it appears that these issues are a thing of the past, because I spent 6ish hours straight in multiplayer without a single hiccup.I was honestly so pumped about playing the game that I was having reading comprehension issues, and couldn't figure out how to trade with people in multiplayer (it is literally the easiest thing, click people icon in bottom right, click person you want to trade with, hit trade, or, PRESS P), but luckily enough for me, Alex, the producer of the game, came into my Twitch stream and gave us tips and tricks (that I am sure I just didn't read in the first place lol) and helped us figure stuff out, while he was sitting at the airport. Hell of a team they have there, in my opinionThe music. OH. MY. GOD. The music. I sat in the bar on my ship for about 20 minutes just listening to the little ditties that my ship band would belt out. So incredibly well done. It's hard to explain the allure of the music, it's just so adorably silly, maybe? The in game sounds are really well done as well, when you hit a charged shot (don't actually know what the skill is called lol) and you hear that big pulse before it slams into an enemy and rips it to shred is a thing of excellence. The only audio issue I have is that in loading screens, the audio hangs and stutters for me (and a couple other folks I was talking to and playing with). If that is the only issue I am going to have with this game, well, let's just say that 7.8 hours on record (at the time of this review) is only going to go up and up.I highly recommend this game to anybody who like tactical RPGs and party management, as well as loot hunting, and transmutation of items into better items (think Horadric Cube from Diablo 2).9.75/10, easily.

												Two hours in and Im having a blast! Fun little space adventure loot-em-up. Quirky style. So far, I love what Ive seen. Little oddball games like this are a real joy to me.Lots of little systems to keep you entertained - the combat is simple enough, yet keeps you on your toes - Id almost call the game 'casual fun' but I havent gone far enough in to see how crazy it may (probably will) become. Already had some bonkers fights and Im only level 10.Its cute, its fun and for those of you that like lots of loot, research and skill trees - theres tons to go around. Also, upgrading your ship wasnt something I realized was in the game (as in buying entirely new ships and adding rooms that give buffs) - and that was a real treat to discover.At its price range - Id say the game is well worth every penny.Update: Since the lack of auto-attack seems to be the one main flag people are rallying negatively behind: auto-attack would be weird in this. Since exploring a planet is a very simple thing at its core (IE: literally all you do is move, attack and interact) - having auto-attack just wouldnt make any sense - it would be like having auto-attack in Diablo or Torchlight.This game, while having some controls similiar to an RTS, is still more of an ARPG - and auto-attack, I think, doesnt belong here any more than it does in any other ARPG title.

												I highly recommend this game if you're looking for some fun co-op loot'em up. (Both Local and Online up to 4 players)It's hard to put an exact style on this, as I haven't had the luck of playing a lot of games similar to this one.It scratches all my itches; Space, RPG, Random Naming, Story, Tactical Pause and of course LOOT LOOT LOOT!If I had to do a description, I'd describe it as follows:This game is a 2.5D Sidescrolling Tactical RPG with combat like Mass Effect and a looting system much like Borderlands / Diablo.There is a ton of fun to be had choosing the right passives in the upgrade tree and building out your team, going on mission with your new gear, owning tough bossesbut also upgrading your ship and defending it from random encounters occasionally.Replayability is definitely there, you'll find it in the form of ""New Game+"", which stacks indefinitely (NG++++++)So if you're ready to go for a challenge with your mates, it's all there for you.My only complaint would be that the tutorial is on the slower side, but at least they make up for it with good humor!Again, I can only give praise to this gameand I'm utterly happy to have a game straight from my wildest dreams.PS: Some people might call this a casual game and it could be, I play on normal difficulty with my girlfriend. This way she doesn't have to have tactical planning skills. Afterwards when I play alone though, oh boy, I crank that difficulty setting up and have to consider my approach into a room / boss!			"

												A simplistic, but charming and fun little ARPG-light game.Not a game to play hour after hour, but nice enough to play a couple of missions every now and then.The loot is very well 'paced'. With every mission you will find/get one or more items that increase the effectiveness of one or more charachters. The game loop (kill enemies, get loot, level up, repeat) is well done.This is not a deep game, it's not flawless, it's not the next best ARPG ... but it is well worth it's price of  15 euro (currently 13 on sale).

Pro's- The Missions are randomized- There is alot to discover- You can take your Crew in Multiplayer Games- Loot and Lvling- Great Difficulties!Con's- There are some Bugs in Multiplayer :(- The controls are not that handyIf you like games like Diablo and want to support Indi titles, then this is a good choice to start with.I recommend it =)			"

												Im not one for pixel games, mostly play ARPGs, similar to diablo, and also fan of Dragon Age and games before it. Game has a diablo like loot style and squad tactical RPG elements like Dragon Age and some cRPG's out there. Really Enjoying it so far. Hopefully it see continual support from the devs though. Would like to see some adjustments to the menus/ui and 21:9 support!			"

												I saw a lot of reviews stating that the game was lacking content or that it was too slow to start, and I can see why people would say that. However, this game is 15 dollars and for that price tag I beleive if you can get 8 or 9 hours of gameplay out of it, its a pretty solid game. There are plenty of 60 dollar games that last about the same amount of time and have just as little content. If you judge this game for what it is, a smaller game made by a smaller company for a resonable price, it is actually pretty good. I agree it is repetative at times, but personally I generally enjoyed it. On the hardest difficulty it offers some challenge and requires a small amount of strategic thinking while still remaining relaxing to play. My number of hours is misleading as I probably left the game running in the background for about 20 hours, don't expect to get more than 10-15 hours out of the game currently. It has SOME replay value with a new game + mode, but its literally the same thing over again with no added benefit. 7/10 enjoyable but not outstanding.			"

												i don't give my trust to companies. I research games before i buy them, and buy the ones I like the looks of. I have yet to buy a game I thought was worth returning. Doesn't mean I won't return one if i believe it isn't worth my money.This one is worth my money. Even if the devs never release the patches they have promised it is a finished and well made product. I didn't think so at first. Finding it slow and boring. It keeps drawing me back in though. The further I go the more interesting and complex it gets.Edit:I have been playing more and find all the different complexities really come into play when using the  higher difficulties. With proper understanding of all the different systems in this game, I think even the toughest difficutly is playable with a starting party. Not certain. I am not very good at the level of strategy this game allows for.			"

												OH on an edited note.  Middle mouse button saves items you want to have in your inventory.  So then just press sell all to get rid of everything else.  When i finally figured that out, SO MUCH EASIERPros : You constantly tell yourself just one more planet.       People like to sneak onto your ship.     Sadly had to disintegrate someone because i had no room on my ship for them right after i saved them.      Helping random people with their stupidity can get you nice things.  Cons:  i get so much stuff that after every planet i either destroy it for material or end up traveling to sell it.          Suppose it either gets repetitive, or you zone out when you're supposed to sleep, and it ends up being some odd hours later.  i mean i guess that one could go either way. The way the multiplayer is and the combat in general, reminds me of Dungeon of the Endless.			"

												I think if you have friends to play all the roles then this could be a rather fun game. The solo play is clunky and a bit tedious to try to control all your characters to actually use all of their abilities in a combat situation. Typically you'll rotate between the same few abilties and there isn't much variation between the enemies you encounter. I don't think this game is bad I just feel like it's unfinished. There are a lot of small things that could be improved upon to make this game much better, but until they decide to do that I would wait until it's 5$ or less.			"

												so far that i have played, they have taken what made pixel piracy and cranked it up to 100 in space. a very well done transition with better combat, ui, and overall gameplay. though i wouldve loved to see a bit more depth. like certain enemies being more dangerous to certain classes. sort of a rock paper scissors if you will. and ive seen flying enemies but havent seen anything that would make my characters fly, dont know if there is a jetpack but its a missed opportunity, it would be great to have a unit pretty much immune to melee unless jetpack depletes or an enemy with some sort of a weapon thats effective against would show up and also thgere are elemental effects like fire, radiation, poison but problem is it doesnt tell you whether an enemy is weak against it or not, only way you could tell is not to attack the posion spreading enemies with poison but other than that i havent seen anything that tells me if an enemy is weak against a certain type. otherwise really enjoyable title for the loot, 2d, rpg, tactical, dungeon crawelers out there. ps play the game on ironman mode. it makes each unit more unique especially if you lose em, it has a greater impact.

												Not recommended for now,negative first:1. No auto attack. It's an RTS game but your unit will be idle when the enemies attacked you, so if you were swarmed by 20 enemies you basically have to click 20 times to kill them all, and more if you use skills. 2. Too many loot. Every mission will give you better loot, which is nice, but because of that you have to equip every single one of your crew in order to become efficient as the game progresses. It would be nice if there's an ""equip best item"" button.3. Monotonous, you beamed down, complete mission, equip loot, repeat until you finish your game.positive:1. Procedural generation, no two playthroughs are the same.2. Many mission variety like collect something, defend something from certain waves, kill bosses, etc. Well I said monotonous before but it's about the gameplay not the mission variety.3. Beautiful graphic, it's in pixel but some are not I think. But the aesthetic has worked so well in my opinion. Snowy planet with cyborg's bases in it. Desert planet, temprate forest, the monsters, the mechas, it's like you really go adventure in a beautiful sci fi world.This review might change to positive if my 1st point in negative has been taken care of.

												Yeah, here i am writing a negative review of this game. I was kinda hyped for this game and expected to like it, but i should've known better.It is much like pixel piracy in many ways, some bad, some good. It feels fun at first but dies down quickly, the gameplay is rather repetitive and the controls are weird.The entire 1.4 hours i played the idea was to just go here, kill these enemies, grab the stuff they drop, get a reward, repeat.The controls seemed cool but i quickly realised how clunky and difficult it was to control a larger crew, so many, many times i found my crew just standing idle and being shot at and often when i ordered my crew to do something they just wouldn't do it and kept standing still.In my opinion loot is dropped in too large numbers, as almost half of my playtime was just sorting my loot and skill points. And also the loot level varies much as in one of the first missions i got a decent melee weapon with about 40 dps, then in the next mission  i got a melee weapon with about 250 dps which absolutely decimated all enemies with 1-2 hits.Im sad to do this but i had to ask for a refund as the game jsut isn't what i expected. I'll still keep my eye on it in case they release updates that fix issues in the game.Steele out. *drops the mic*			"

Product received for free
												Very engaging Exploration RPG with plenty to do, plenty to accomplish, and plenty to customize. From Dozens of planets to explore, many missions to partake in, and a goofy story to boot, there is plenty of fun to be had. For its generous price tag at 14.99$, you're certainly getting your moneys worth overall, and this game is a large improvement over the past game by Quadro Delta, Pixel Piracy.This game also incorporates playthroughs at ones own pace and style. Wether you would like to do a playthrough with a full set of Vanguards, or have a space pirate crew of tech geniuses with rifles hacking everything, the option is yours and can sometimes be even viable!Multiplayer certainly adds to the game as well with your fellow allies adding to whatever adventure you're looking for, wether it's a fun experimental playthrough or a hard serious one to forge onward to victory, this game has it. And after you're done with it all? Well there's New Game + to satiate the need or want ot hang on to what you currently have and see what else you can find and do, as well as get those end game upgrades to turn your soldiers into a force to be reckoned with (but perhaps not a serious one?)Overall, this game is a safe buy, and has enough customization and goals to keep you entertained for hours on end.

												First let me start positive. I love the idea of the game. I like loot based games, I love the dopamine rush you get when you upgrade your units. the art style is nice, generally it's pretty fun but with a few huge flaws that i can't get past.Apparently there is some kind of data leak issue a lot of people are having, reminds me of another game... hmmm. pixel piracy all over again. *Cough* basically re skinned and made more confusing for no reason even though it has the same basic gameplay.-No auto attack/attack move. making some of the ""difficulty"" and game play extremely artificial and tedious. Yea let's make the player click each individual bug from swarmer enemies, that’s brilliant.game is clearly designed in a way where it should have ""behavior"" options, almost like a tower defense""Target lowest hp enemy in range""""highest hp enemy""""closest enemy in range""etc-No auto attack/attack move-No auto attack/attack move-Redundant bloated menu's, can't sell stuff in crew tab even when at a station (for example), have to click ""market"" for some reason, then it's harder to compare and remember what you wanted to save/sell. YES I realize you can ""star"" something so it doesn't auto sell. I still find navigating menu after menu in such a simple styled game tedious and pointless.Devs couldn't choose what type of combat they wanted apparently. the game largely strikes me as a ""bash your ball of units into the enemies until they go bye bye"" type of gamebut then there is all this push for this hyper tactical ""combat pause"" so I can what? ... click the grenade button at the right time. wow so exciting, I’m like playing CS:GO or something.I legit just spam right mouse at the nearest enemy and click every box when it comes up. this is frankly how the game is BUILT to be played. so why can't the devs just embrace that.not adding auto attack is so artificial. it's like in an RTS ( which in a lot of ways this game is a 2d sidescroller RTS, think warcraft 3 using a band of the hero units, that is essentially this game) a unit getting attacked and not attacking back, it's like not having ""attack move"" function. It a basic feature this type of game obviously would have.Review is going to be negative until this is changed. yes it's that big of a deal.I can deal with the stupid 20 menus and dumb♥♥♥♥♥ship upgrading game that is largely redundant and bloated AF but I can't deal with no auto attack.pretty much everything in this game should be automatic, toggle-able. and I sincerely believe the only reason they didn't do it is ACTUALLY because they had trouble coding the AI and behavior. not actually because they made a mindful decision for the good of the game.

												I enjoy the concept of the game and want to like it, but it's unbelievably irritating to have to pause every 5 seconds if I want to do anything outside of zerg rushing.  You don't want auto-attacking be a feature.  Okay, I get it.  It's a different story when characters won't keep attacking their target after reloading or temporarily have their attacks interrupted.I shouldn't have to feel like I'm doing more clicking in this game than I am in the upper-level moba scene.

												Melee-focused action games have spent years enacting the fantasy of engaging in armed combat, fortunately sparing us the hours of rigorous training and resolve it takes to actually do so in real life. But Pixel Privateers, Ubisoft's third-person weapon-based arena combat game, is different from other melee-focused action games, like Dark Souls or Dynasty Warriors. Its combat system is simple on the surface, but executing its more advanced tactics requires a patient mind, as well as an understanding of its deliberate pacing. There are not many games quite like For Honor; it's an incredibly entertaining fighter that's satisfying both in single and multiplayer, even despite the narrative flaws of its story mode.Its fantasy medieval world is populated by three of history's most iconic warrior classes: knights, vikings, and samurai. Regardless of which faction you choose to play as, Pixel Privateers challenges you to restrain yourself and uphold self-control in the face of strenuous conflict. The elegance of its combat is at times awe-inspiring, easily pulling you into the euphoric highs of a well-deserved victory, where your patience was maintained and your reflexes were on point.			"

												The Game is very broken balance wise, alot of things are so unbelievable overpowered, it takes away the whole point of playing. The sheer amount of loot makes you spend at least half the time in the inventory screen.Could be fun, if the progression path was intact. But as stated above and below, it totally isn't. 99,9% of the loot is completely useless after some short time, and finding upgrades between all the garbage becomes very tiresome.My team deals so much damage, i don't even notice a difference between +0 and +7 difficulty, everything dies the moment i click on it. All thanks to some epic gun i found at level 30 and the ease of stacking +int and +critdamage. (level 60 now, still too OP)Was fun for a while, but as it stands, i wouldn't recommend spending full price here.If you can pick it up for 1,99 sure; enjoy an afternoon or two with it and see for yourself.

												A game with lots of randomness. If you like a Strategy game and not lazy to click 1 by 1 enemies, i suggest this game good for you. Random map, random encounters, random mission and etc, except the story. The game much challanging, at the start of game you can choose 2 mode game normal or hard, so normal mode your crews dead can be ressurected and hard mode your crews permanent dead , you can change map difficuly to make it harder and you get great reward or make it easier but you won't get good reward. The game is kinda funny too with lot jokes and cute thing while the story looks like have serious tension.  The story was mainstream space scifi like, while you explore into deep space you will encounter more deeper story.I'm still not testing multiplayer mode, but its sure looks fun too. Hope you enjoy my review, and sorry if my review not good. Thx for reading it~~  :p			"

												I've decided to post a review for the first time on Steam. First of all, I'm a huge fanboy of Terraria, so this review might be biased. Pixel Privateers is the perfect game for those who enjoy exploration, lootsplosions, role playing, tactical boss fights, 90's era immersion, and quality audio. For the price, this is a no-brainer. I tend to judge price based on replay value, and for this reason alone this game is priceless, in the literal sense. I look forward to spending many more hours playing in NG+ and beyond.I also want to shout out to the Devs for releasing this ""with the people"". We hung out in discord and various variety twitch streams on release day and they were more than willing to answer questions and tackle day one issues with customers. Top notch guys, well played.- This review was sponsored by hug			"

												Patching review after some time spent.First of all, I wont swear UX designers here (surprise!), but devs. Problem lies in just bad code: in 4K you're unable to select planet (you should switch to full HD) and in full HD lifts are buggy (lift goes somewhere, but camera does not and there are no way to move viewport, you should swithch back to 4K and so on).Game is good for graphics, idea of grinding and so on. But I simple can't recommend it, bugs are nasty and HOW devs missed them? I spend near hour to find the workaround and play somehow.			"

												Overall i'd recommend it, more so if it's on sale.I like the art, effects, design, sound and the feel of combat. Loads of great loot with a decent tech tree and a cool little loot upgrader/converter mechanic.Overall it was far too easy though, after doing about 12 or so missions I played every mission on max difficulty, I think I needed to clone a character once.Took 12 hours to complete, but I felt way overpowered for the final bosses (my characters were lvl 43), probably could be completed a lot quicker. Never had to use pause mode for a single fight, just make sure you have 1 of each class (you only need 5 crew, thats all i had) with decent tools, click the prompts over the heads when they appear and your set.You have to spend too much time in the inventory screen looking through and sorting your loot, it gets a bit long in the tooth and can take as long as some missions.New game plus is a joke, just as bad as No Mans Sky, but most NG+'s are so no suprise really.Overall fun, wish it had a bit more planet variation, a few more bar songs, a bit more challenge and a better late game or NG+.

												Lots of fun and easy to use UI system,  the game has elements from roguelikes, FTL and a few other games like those, it's great how you have control of your away team when exploring the planetary levels.  They can be leveled up, you put the stat points where you want, the gear you eqip them with decides the class of your away team units.			"

												If you like loot, this game is a winner.The basic gameplay loop is Request Missions (optional), go to planet/mission location, select you crew members and beam down onto a randomly generated 2d area and proceed to kill everything.  Each character has 4 slots to put things in.  A body armor slot, helmet slot, primary weapon slot and a utility/secondary weapon slot..  There are 5 classes and classes are determined by what item or weapon (Equipping 2 weapons makes you the Marine class) is in the offhand.  Classes are a Vanguard which acts as the tank, Marine which is DPS/Tank/Utility, Engineer which is utility or DPS (turrets are OP), Sniper which is DPS and some utility, and Medic which is heal.  Game has a huge variety of loot and each class has a couple different class items to choose from.  For example, for the Medic I've found a heal gun that shoots out a beam of healing.  A Heal drone, which has a little drone floating around doing AoE heals, and a Defibrillator which can resurrect members and also heal them (although it isn't automatic like the rest). On top of all the classes, you also have access to a tech tree that you use to get more abilities and things.  It goes from Tier 1 up to Tier 7 and each tier has 6 categories you can pick for a 'major' ability and then 3-4 minor abilites in each category.When you get ready to beam down to a planet you have 9 difficulty levels to choose from, ranging from Soothing (-5 elvl, loot quality -0.2) to Tribulating (+7elvl, loot quality +5).  I know this game has a NG+ mode so there may be even more.  Initially I was playing on Tormenting and it felt a bit easy but the first 3 missions are more of a tutorial and after them, it got challenging.  I had to make sure my Vanguard taunted and my healer dropped aggro.  Anyways, if you like loot games and the never-ending quest of getting loot to get better loot, this game is a winner.  It also supports up to 4 people in multiplayer, although I haven't tried it so can't comment on it.I realize I basically just described the game but really, you're either a fan of loot games/ARPGS in which case you'll probably love this.  If you're not a fan, you probably won't like this.In my case, I really love it and can see myself playing it for awhile.  Also the devs have been really responsive to any questions/concerns/tech issues (join the Quadro Delta discord).Thumbs up			"

												So far a pretty good game. It's very similar to Pixel Piracy and reminds me a little bit of the space stage from Spore.I wasn't sure about getting it at first because I already own Pixel Piracy and in case it's the same game just re-skinned, but I decided to give it a try and I don't regret it.They said there will be more content, which I'm looking forward to, but it doesn't feel empty or like it lacks content, so I'd say it's safe to buy now already.

												I really like the graphics, tactical gameplay, and plethora of loot after each mission. One thing I will say about the weapon/armor upgrade system is that it is time consuming. I wish the filter system was a bit more intuitive in regards to helping me determine what new loot will go best with which of my characters. In particiular, the armor system: I wish the interface would better anticipate what new gear is useful to me after a mission.			"

Even with the loot system being a little funny, the game is still golden and worth the price. The developers have done a good job and future updates could make some tweaks to these cons.

  Well I'm 8 hours into the game and in one word I'd say this game is, nostalgic. I used to play games like this constantly for hours when I was younger, one big one that comes to mind right now is Champions of Norrath. Look it up, it was insanely fun back on PS2. This game is definitely going to get a lot of people playing this. 9/10 The TL;DR is it's an addictive and game full of depth. 	Pros:  - It has cute and fun stories along with great character creation. The quirky little moments in the game make it all pleasant.  - It keeps you entertained and makes you forget what day of the week it is when you snap out of it for meal time or bathroom breaks.  -  Combat has so much structure. The first few levels you can kind of get by killing things  just straight up blazing but then it takes stragety for small groups of mobs and even more for the big bosses. We're talking having to move to certain areas when the boss does abilities or positioning well for fights. Your whole crew can die with the wrong positioning.   -  Combat abilities on your crew are easy but yet difficult to do. It's not that hard if you hit the spacebar to pause and que abilities but for newbies it'll be a bit confusing for a little bit. Thankfully whichever main crew member you're controling, the rest will do their abilities automatically. It won't be the BEST but they do activate by itself. Which is honestly fine because when it's really needed perfectly is boss fights which you can just sit up and work your micro magic.Cons:   - Rocky start, it can be a bit confusing. The tutorial is mostly a must even if you're used to gaming like me. It's just a lot of information to learn but after the tutorial I swear you feel confident to go on your own. BUT there are some things still not truly explained when you're going on your adventures. It's not too bad but it's some trial and error (minor errors).   - I've played it 8 hours and only experienced one bug but it was small. Other than that it's been completely smooth. I had one of my crew members get stuck floating on a lift (elevator) and the rest of the crew went down to another room.  And the lift wouldn't budge after that saying somethings in the way, with no way to get the crew back up or no way to get the other guy down. Just had to port out but thankfully I had completely my quest already and I was just going around on the planet getting extra XP/items.  --------			"

												Current Patch:  1.0.0Experience: got a squad of 8 to lv 50+The Good:-Loot explosions are great. -Loot Donkies (like loot goblins from diablo.). -Pixel art is wonderful.-SFX and music hit the spot.-Tactical mode feels like I'm playing a management game. (Dwarf Fortress/Rim world. This is a plus for me but maybe not for others.)-Combat really shines on the big mobs/boss fights.-Damage meter. This is the first ARPG-ish game I've played with a damage meter. This is very helpful and I love it. The Bad:-Managing 8 players without group hot-kets blows. It would be nice to assign hotkeys for multiple units so I can manage my tanks a bit better or mose my healers away without stopping my damage from dpsing.-No auto attack. I know the devs made this intentional decision to have no auto attack but in all honesty it doesn't feel right. Clicking every single tiny mob is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ During boss fights or large mobs I always resort to tactial mode anyway. Having to click on every tiny mob cuts down on clear time though and it feels janky.-Loot quantity and quality.             This game has tons of loot which you would think is good, right? Yes and No. I have played countless hours of diablo, grim dawn and Path of Exile (outside of steam).  While grim dawn drops a good chunk of useless loot there's less loot in that game than Pixel Privateers but it's more meaningful. In Pixel Privateers they have item find % as one of the stats from gear to acquire even more loot to offset the lack of quality loot. Path of exile did the same thing but they also had Item Quality % even though I think these types of stats are not very interesting they did serve their purpose to off set the bad drop rates of good loot. Diablo 3 vanilla had this same issue where you would not see an upgrade for hours or even days after max level. Pixel Privateers lacks the interesting loot affixes that ARPGs are known for; procs/auras/skills.            In Grim Dawn I might get a helm that can send my character into a berserking rage at the cost of taking more damage or have an item that can sometimes charge up in power before exploding later on.  The usual affixes I see on some of the gear in this game tends to be a % chance to maybe drop a healing item or spawn a drone ect. Nothing that really stands out or maybe I wasn't lucky enough to find said gear. There is a lot of time spent in menus but I'm used to these kind of games. Others may not like the down time though.  Bugs:-F8 key will disable the UI and this happens to be a default keybind for selecting a unit. This could be unique to me though so I'm not so sure.-Selecting a healing ability can sometimes make the attack command disappear and leaves your guys unable to attack until a restart of the game happens. - 2560 x 1440 resolution makes the text so unbearably small that I need to whip out my old granny glasses to read it.   I love the game though. It has a strong theme.  If I had to sum it up this game is like Borderlands and a casual starcraft mod with a little diablo mixed in for good measure.			"

												What a gem!Absolutely loving this game, found a great little combo of explosive rifles and talents that spawn spiders on explosions. Spider army for the win!-- Pros --Gameplay: Quite good, offers a tactical mode where the game pauses when s**t hits the fan and things get quite hectic. Which happens quite often with a team of 8 privateers blasting through space punks.Visuals: Pixel art is great, love the style and there are quite a few beautiful landscapes to see as you slaughter a plethora of aliens collecting fuel and matter.Audio: Soundtrack is great, sitting on the ship listening to the band singing in the cantina. Nothing is more pleasurable that the popping of the gluttons.Story: Have only completed a small part of the main story line, but it has piqued my interest and kept me enthralled.Dev's/Team: What an amazing group of people! Active discord channels with Dev's and the community relation teams setting up Q&A sessions and very responsive with bug reports and follow up. This is the kind of relationship other games companies need to have with their community.If you have played one of QD's earlier titles ""Pixel Pirates"" you will love this and lose many an hour hunting down more loot and killing all the things.-- Cons --Only problems i have encountered were:Bad connection to some people while playing multiplayer (which more than likely is a problem on the hosting player end, and is currently being looked into by the dev's)Exploit with the replicator making collection of some items not needed (which is also being fixed as i type this)10/10 would explode all the things many many more times.

												Boring inventory management game. Spend more time equiping your dudes and naming them than actually doing anything else. Combat:- Highlight dudes (or press q)- Click on bad guy (just once)- Win- Move to next bad guy down the map- Click on bad guy (still once)- WinPacing of item drops seems bizarre. Got a legendary healer item from the first level and armor went from 6 armor rating to over 200 on the second planet I visited. Just started murdering everything no problem with my team of 5 dudes and I think 8 is the maximum so considering I didn't even have a full party the game is mindlessly easy.Couple small grievances like the descriptions of some menu items will pop up under the cursor rather than beside so the text is obscured.On the positive side the game is cute and makes harmless family-friendly jokes.However no child is going to play this game for more than an hour and not get horribly bored of a lack of action or challenge.Re-logic hit the mark with Terraria but at this rate their name is becoming synonomous with lacklustre micro-management games that can't quite find the right balance between menus and action, and that's sad.

												There simply isn't enough depth to motivate you into pouring hours and hours into this game. The late game (we're talking 20 hous) seems like it was rushed, tacked on to give the illusion of ""more"" to do. But when you stumble into steamrolling on the hardest difficulty available, with gear that either rarely ever improves or has stats like 100%+ damage reduction, the desire to keep playing evaporates.If this goes on sale for <$10, go for it. It's a neat little game. Maybe if I blindly trust Re-Logic's involvement to mean another 100h+ experience, I wouldn't feel so disappointed in burning through this over a long weekend.			"

												So yeah I got my moneys worth and it was entertaining but I dunno. I sorta excepted a bit more comedy from the game, maybe a little bit more story?I mean this was something that people compared it with borderlands. I expected I was going to be needing to be a lot stronger to beat bosses so I grinded a bit on planets only to 30.. Considering how fast leveling was I figured it wasn't much. I basically tore through all the bosses with ease even though the games party metric claimed I had low defense. I could afk tank bosses with my crew.. It was sorta sad. I know the devs are working to balance explosive builds but still.. There wasn't much actual content to this game. -Spoilers- ?""Learn the history of various factions and their place in the universe, and become part of the intrigue yourself. Where do your loyalties lie? What part will you play? See how the story unfolds! ""What history? You barely get two lines of dialog with most of these encounters. What place in the universe? Everything wants to fight you. What loyalties? There's no alliance with any faction. Seriously I tried to join the mutants but nope they just wana kill you. Robots? Yeah they wana kill you too? The President? Yup you guessed it, he wants to kill you. Story? What story? Some old dude wants you to get 5 gems and surprise! He's the final boss!♥♥♥♥♥♥cliches aren't bad but god damn I called that ending when I first met the guy.""Post Launch ContentWe plan to bring free content expansions to Pixel Privateers post-launch. Encompassing not only our ideas, but also suggestions from the Community, we are looking forward to actively supporting Privateers for a long while to come.""Yeah... but this game is so bare bones I say this should be in Beta still... Ship gear is rather pointless. Mobs don't instantly spawn throughout the ship. So it is pointless to even have miniguns or slow fields when you only fight one room at a time. Hell if they don't even have control of my ship.. Why don't we just suck the air out of the rooms they are in.. They can't even open doors... The hell.Honestly steam needs a better rating system. Just yes or no isn't enough.. If you just want a good 2d shoot em up game then yeah get PP but if you are expecting ""Huge Universe"" or ""Storyline and Factions"" then no. You're better off investing your time elsewhere.			"

 Review - Pixel Privateers Review brought you by Save Or Quit[www.saveorquit.com] Reviews, visit us!===> Essential purchase>> Recommended Purchase> Purchase if on sale> Purchase if heavily disocunted> Do not purchase=== Overview Pixel Privateers is, basically, a 2D side-scrolling dungeon crawling ARPG with exploration and management elements. In this game, you will be appointed as Captain of a mercenary ship contracted by The Company, a galaxy-scale corporation which always seeks profitable opportunities. When a mysterious wormhole appears in a region of space, your ship is sent there to investigate potential unknown technology or scientific data for The Company to acquire. But, as always, things don't go as planned: the mercenary ship gets sucked in a gravity well and teleported to the other side of the wormhole, with apparently no chance of going back. Stranded, with few resources and fuel, in a dangerous unknown galaxy, it will be up to you to fullfill the directives your employers left you and find a way to go back to the known universe. And, since you are there, make a good profit out of it!=== Gameplay Analysis The gameplay of Pixel Privateers is divided in two distinct sections.The first one is your ship: You will be in command of a space vessel and its crew, and so, have the power to equip every single member to defint his role in the team (different types of equipments will determine different classes, which in turn will have unique abilities), upgrade their statistics when they level up, resarch new technologies with the Science Lab, replicate any good items you found with the Replicator (tea, earl grey, hot), clone your own crew members to create the ultimate army via the Cloning Lab, and resarch alien artifacts with the Resarch Lab and in turn gain Resarch Points to spend in new technologies. All these things tho are not free and require Matter to be done. Matter is in fact the primary resource of the game, used in almost every single thing from teleporting crew members to replicating objects (or people). Matter can be gained as a reward for missions, bought, harvested or from converting old equipment.But it does not stop there, as in the ship there is even more: the Galaxy Map will allow you to see all the nearby planets and eventual space anomalies, and so drive the ship at the next destination, request new Missions from The Company or eventual new employers you may find in the Unknown Galaxy, and manage random encounters to decide what to do when they happen. Also, if docked at a shipyard, you will have the chance of building a variety of additional rooms in your ship (for a price of course), whihc will give different, often powerful, bonuses, like increased crew capacity or a remote link with the market when far from space stations, or also deploy additional on-board ship defenses to counter ship boarding parties, and finally of course buy a new ship if you need more space.When traveling through space, always keep an eye for Fuel, as if you run out of it, you will have to launch a Distress Signal in hope of some good soul to lend you some, but who knows who might answer it...The second major part of Pixel Privateers' gameplay is the Ground Sections:When approaching any planet, you will be able to descend on the surface, often in proximity of some hostile encampment, with the purpose of going there, blasting those aliens out of existence and get all their sweet loot. After all, survival has no compromises, the mission must be accomplished. Not that the aliens of the Unknown Galaxy are friendly, oh quite the opposite. Be it mutants, genetically enginnered abominations, cyborgs, rogue AIs or supernatural creatures, you will find youself facing a staggeringly wide variety of enemies, and such variety is also found in the loot you will find from then and missions, composed of a great variet of armors, weapons and utility items.The Combat in Pixel Privateers is Real Time Pausable, so you can decide tactically each move when it's needed, and have a quick real time experience when it is not. Each of the Classes (Engineer, Vanguard, Scout, Marine, Medic) have its own unique abilities which differentiate it majorly from the others. Each class has its own attributes to rely upon and aswell a bast-suited type of weapon for their role, but that does not mean you cannot give anyone any equip you want, you can certainly! By fighting, your crew will level up more and more unlocking abilities and bringing to the ship all the stuff, with which you will then equip them. If some of them happen to die, what happens depends on difficulty level: on Normal you can make a clone of the dead member and teleport it down again at the cost of Matter, while on Hardcore character death is permanent and if your whole gorund force dies, you will have to restart from the beginning of the adventure.When deploying to a planet, you will also be able to select a Difficulty Modifier, higher it is, better loot you will find and more XP you will get, but also you will face MUCH tougher enemies. Since enemies always scale with your level by default, the Difficulty Modifiers will always be a great challenge, and to be overcome will require a great deal of thinking and squad tactics.I have only a warning for you all, in the long run this might become all a bit repetitive. You have been warned.=== Technical Analysis Technically, Pixel Privateers is exactly what is to be expected by a modern 2D side scrolling game. Varied, high quality and well-made effects are common, the pixel art is very well done and polished, the art of landscapes and enemies on the various planets is really beautiful and immersive.Art direction, very well done.The sound effects are alright, exception to be made for the utterly annoying music put on the ship deck for some reason, which will mostly ruin many a dialogue with various NPCs. You will know what music i am talking about.Speaking of bugs, there are no major issues apart from one, as far as i know: there is a major bug with the Medic class which will break the UI and so the player will not be able to order his team to attack, leading to death and misery on the battlefield. To avoid it, remember to NEVER order the Medic to heal someone, let him do on its own.Speaking of Performance, any modern and even old PC is capable of running a title with this graphical style, so there should be no prolems.=== Conclusion and Rating Definitely, Pixel Privateers is the rightful heir to Pixel Piracy: bigger, better, more varied, no ship building block by block but everything else is there and delivers solidly. A game suggested to all those who love exploration, variety, action and a bit of management thrown in the mix. Hardcore gamers welcome with an Hardcore mode which really is a test for all who like Roguelike experiences. FINAL RATING: 78 / 100  "

												This game is so awesome.I'm not usually big on RPGs but this game got me hooked way too fast. It's world building is great. I am constantly looking forward to expanding my crew. Exploring new worlds. Building my ship (which has an AWESOME bar in it). It's a fun game that I just hope keeps going.My only complaint is that the exposition can get a bit much (especially in the beginning). Like, all the information is good but it can be a bit tiring to read. Some voice work would be nice in situations like that. But if you're patient enough, it'll all be worth it.			"

												This game is fun for about the first 10 hours but the lack of autoattack really hampers strategy in the late game which made me stop playing. Since it's in real time (you can pause but that quickly becomes a serious chore), you have to make sure you're attacking constantly so it just drives you to attacking one enemy at a time with everyone. The game seems to want that given that it works, but it makes the game boring and a grind. Also the loot management in the store isn't great. I didn't see a way to sell multiple items which makes raising money instead of matter a pain. All in all, it's not bad and fun for a bit, but there are better games to play.			"

												Played for 1.5 hours. The gameplay so far has consisted of: Go to new planet, right click on enemies until dead, sift through loot for slightly better loot to equip, rinse and repeat. I'm just staggeringly bored, and this is after deliberately upping the difficulty to try and make it more fun. No interesting story has presented itself, there's no interaction with the factions, nothing has happened. All you do is just grind samey quest after samey quest. Complete 3 quests, get some more quests. Complete those quests get more quests. If you like borderlands you'll probably like this, but I've been through one too many skinner boxes in my time			"

												Even if I didn't play much, I played with my friend  at his place (me with him) and it was fun ( for first hour). So I bought game and realised how boring it is. You can't help it. It's just boring. No amount of updates gonna fix it. I would recomend that you get cracked version online, play it for 1-2 hours and if you like it, buy it. However, playing with friends is more fun ( if you manage to get someone to buy this). All in all, not recomending.			"

												""So far, so good!""Pixel privateers is in it's core a diablo-esque roguelite (mockingly called ""2d borderlands"") and this is a great thing if done right, which so far seems the current course it's taking.There's a bunch of updates and content scheduled to release at a later date and i will update this review to match it once the game is more ""complete"" but as it is, it's thoroughly enjoyable. Good variation, solid gameplay, functional multiplayer and generally very well done in what it set out to do. Good times if you pick it up. Great times with friends :)			"

												really fun game, like Diablo meets Space meets FTL(without ship combat) with a bit of resource managment. I will say it can be repetitive but the stats and classes and combos and loot make each new planet/mission fun while still having a larger goal!  Bonus you can adjust harder or easier for better loot/challenge much similar to Diablo as well!			"

												It's a pretty solid game. TONS of loot, very polished gameplay with very few bugs if any, and unique gameplay. If you liked pixel pirates you'll like this, and even if you didn't like pirates, this feels like a completely different game (because it is) so I'd still give it a shot if it looks interesting to you.The only complaint I have is that it can get repetitive, but then you will fight bosses and other stuff along the way that spice it up so it isn't much of an issue.8/10- good choice not going for the early access approach as with pirates.

												I really want to like this game but as it currently is I cannot recommend it. Lets get the biggest Problems out of the way first. The text size is too small.Like WAAY to small. Having to read every item description three times until you guess the right words makes me want to quit the game immedietly.Multiplayer works well until you loose a few packages. Once that happens the level becomes completely unplayable. You are then basically watching the game at half speed with minutes of delay. One time I entered a game completely without GUI. Everyone say it too much loot but I dont think its that much of a problem.It seems that way because of the way the Inventory is handled.The inventory takes less than 1/10th of your screen and every Item you pick up ends up inside it. Then you have to start comparing going through all your characters one after the other and see if any of those Items you picked up are better than those you have equipped and then continue on with your next character. Oh those items are on different pages btw so have fun looking through all those pages too. The sorting options are there but always sort your whole inventory and you still basically have to sort by hand as you can only sort by one option like type of weapon. You will still have to sort for damage manually.Now combine this with the fact that it doesnt seem very clear which item is better than another. While you have arrows indicating whether or not this item is an improvement to what you have equipped these arrows are for some reason missing on the Main stat of every item???Balance is completely off between different missions. While I did 4 missions in the beginning increasing the difficulty 3 times so that an actual challenge appears. The 6th Mission was then for some reason completely impossible to achieve (I got completely destroyed ran away and barely got away with my last crew member ). So I had to turn down difficulty again. The actual fighting turns annoying very quickly. Why is there no autoattack? Sometimes you just hear shooting and assume you are shooting but its actually only the enemy shooting while you are just looking at them. Then theres no way to zoom in and some enemies are literally 3 pixels big even finding them is difficult. Using abilities is really difficult. You have to select a character to use their abilities meaning if you really quickly want to tell your tank to taunt the enemy you will be forced to pause the game and either find him and click with your mouse or use TAB to quickly switch through all of your eight characters and then use his ability. These abilities are also missing proper explanations for now my marine just has an ability that does damage one he has shot a few times. Once he has done that there appears a button above the enemy he is attacking. SO again pause the game click a button and then we can continue. Would love to try again in after a few patches. The latest patch at least allows you to turn off the weird 3D moving menu good job on that one :)			"

												I am choosing to refund this game because it does not have an auto-attack function.Moving a squad of characters around and manually clicking on EVERY enemy and manually triggering EVERY ability is extremely tedious, and completely unnecessary. Other contemporary titles of this type include auto-attacks for good reason.When and if the game is updated to include this, I will purchase it again.			"

												There really needs to be a ""not for me"" choice on here, the idea behind the game seems very good; loot, away missions, progression... what's not to like?

												It pains my heart to say this but, i do not recomend this game,I tried the coop with a friend and it was just too repetitive to be enjoyable,The game follows this pattern , get a mission(which 90% time is basically explore the whole map) , go from room to room killing all enemies and looting,.After your are done with a planet(usually around 15 min or so) you go back to the main ship and use the loot you acquired just like a normal rpg, but the thing is i never felt that changing the equipment was actually helping anything , the difficulty always stayed the same no matter if you are character had armor or not,So in the end , this game might be fun for people who like looting i guess, there are tons of diferent loot(think borderlands) , but the gameplay in itself for me was too repetitive and boring,There are some pros to the game, the music was excelent(it never felt repetitive) , didnt find a single bug during my playtrought.

												As much fun as the live feed on twitch was today, playing this title wasn't any fun for us. Simply increasing numbers, is not character growth in my opinion. Even multiplayer which seemed like it would be great, was not fun. Any differences in the classes of your crew become pointless once you understand how the leveling system works or doesn't work, since it basically just increasing numbers. We had no disconnects but we were all falling asleep between the soundtrack filled with elevator music and the lack of meaningful gameplay, I personally dozed off more than once. That Twitch feed was so different. The player was excited about everything. However, as a player, I found nothing exciting about any of it.It took about 45 minutes to understand where the gameplay actually was. The first 20 minutes into the game you are bombarded with an information overload of the many systems and subsystems in the game. However, soon after you realize that none of those systems actually matter. They don't effect gameplay except by allowing it to continue longer between being defeated.In the end, the entire game is repeating the same thing over and over while surrounded by differently colored pixels... No strategy, planning, or even thought required. I suppose it can be called a game, since all the pieces are there. However last time I checked, games required the interest of the players, which this title very much did not.Being overly similar to pixel piracy is not its charm. It is it's downfall. I requested A refund the moment I realized I had dozed off mid game for the 3rd time.			"

												Sorry, I just found it really boring and shallow. Needs a lot more work. The real time squad based combat of the game actually hurts it IMO. You have to constantly pay attention to your crew during combat, because when the enemy they were attacking dies, they just stand there like morons waiting for you to tell them who to attack next, and it's easy to lose them behind enemies. It just doesn't feel good to me gameplay wise. If it was true turn-based, it would be A LOT better IMO. Real time with pause is what this game uses, and with the side-scrolling camera angle, it just doesn't work well together.			"

												Don't buy this game right now.  There's a crippling bug where your party won't attack, and the only thing you can do is just get wiped and lose an enormous chunk of one of your most important resources in order to ressurrect everyone and restart the map.  I've run into it 3 times in around 4-5 hours and it is absolutely infuriating.A bug like this should've never made it to release, and I'm playing this 3 days after the listed release date.  The devs have said they're working on it for the next patch, and I'll update the review when it's fixed.			"

												Like others have said, wish there was something between thumbs up and thumbs down. It's not a bad game; it's polished; the graphics are nice. The problems, as I'm sure you're aware from other reviews is too much loot, making equipment management tedious, and no auto attack meaning having to right click on every enemy on a mission is tedious. To start with combat seemed very brain dead but I'm starting to see a few more interesting mechanics now. Just a question of whether I take that risk and go beyond two hours play time.			"

												This could be a good game. I wouldn't know. I've only played 22 minutes of it, and I can't bear to play any more because of one glaringly irritating issue: the main menu screen that you use for all of your inventory and squad management has this really irritating ""perspective"" thing where the entire thing appears slanted away from the viewer at about a 30 degree angle. There's a reason why most menu screens are flat-on to the viewer: it gives you more space to work with, and it's a lot less disorienting, and given how much time you spend on this screen, I can see this minor irritation turning into a big one after a couple of hours of play. I'm returning this game for a refund until I hear that this issue gets fixed, at which point I might re-review it.			"

												Nah, this one felt like a mobile game. I guess i was expecting at least something slightly more deep (terraria/starbound type of gameplay). The pixel art looked quite decent but i think the characters are too small which makes them lack personality, It's something i'd play on a mobile possibly, it just felt wrong to play on PC, too simplistic and gameplay was just too lacking.

I like the mechanic of using your abillities to survive but it's kind of a letdown for me that they are on autocast.* So far, the ship you have feels very empty.I could definetely see myself spending a lot of time on this game if it's as awesome as my first hour has pictured it to be.

												Pixel piracy in the space, start getting buggy after you increase the crew and the items like pixel piracy, the system requirements doesn't match like pixel piracy and yeah the game have pretty nice reviews in the start like pixel piracy but after a couple of months it will be abandoned like pixel piracy.Isn't too funny like Pixel Piracy btwFor an unfinished game, Pixel Privateers is promising. They take some weird shortcuts with sprite animation, the sprites themselves are a little ugly, combat and exploration is a little bland and monotonous right now, and hopefully they'll fix the buggy, clunky menus soon, but when they finish it, this'll be a great game!Wait, Pixel Privateers IS finished?Oof. Maybe you should skip this one, then.			"

												Good game here. Its right on the border of getting that perfect FTL challenge. Similar to FTL the fights can vary from trivial to puase based skill casting. They currently continue to work on the balance and should end up in a good place. So far this game has been a great casual experience. I would recommend to fans of FTL and... I don't know what else, this take on squad fighting is new to me. You tend to feel more like a single entity though, as the squad for the most part focus the same target. Wish I had friends to play with online, have no idea how cool/easy it is.			"

												This game follows the Borderlands gear mechanics, as such it’s a lot of fun for progression.Unfortunately it had less than 10% of the game length of any borderlands game without DLC and side quests being considered. That’s not to say it’s a liner game, you can farm random missions, there is just no point to wondering off to the side as the enemy levels with you.Still this game is fun and pulled through to about the 8 hour mark for me before starting to feel tedious and uneventful.

												Exceptional game that starts out a tad slow and a higher learning curve than expected. The game does a great job in getting the critical information to you, and after a couple of hours the game really starts to shine. The depth and mechanics are not easily discerned from the screenshots, so if strategy, loot, team building/squad tactics is your thing, you definitely want to get this game.It almost makes up for the disappointing game they released prior to this. I admire how the developers drew from the best parts of Pixel Piracy design, and made a very coherent, enjoyable, and superior game. 9 out of 10 - Bravo.As for the main reason that the game is getting some downvotes, note the time played on those reviews. They are almost always below 1.5 hours. You really need to start getting into the more difficult (read: pause and plan out your battles) content before you start seeing the deeper content available. It's no Factorio, but it really does open up as you continue to grow in power.Hint: Select highger difficulties on the mission screen for a much more enjoyable and challenging experience, as well as increased loot. This option is available from the start.			"

												This is a fun game overall, evokes the sense of a roguelike, but doesn't (at least on normal difficulty) have the depth or strategy of a roguelike. I would have enjoyed a more strategic combat system. There is strategy, there are character and class choices, but none of them really feel that weighty. You are inundated with items so there is almost never a sense of struggle or even a sense of ""man I really like this weapon."" because you'll probably replace it in a mission or two. I'm going to give the hardcore difficulty a shot to see how it effects the game.Reghardless of those things I like in games I play, it is fun, enjoyable, and if you're looking for a ghame to shut your brain off and just play (outside of menus and poor descriptions of items and figuring out how things work).It is an enjoyable experience.

												A definite step up from Pixel Piracy. The game has solid grinding mechanics, all stats are useful for all characters, the loot is interesting as once you get past the first 10 or so levels, the choices between them develop into more than choosing what has the higher stat block. Each class is useful and valuable. It does have its flaws. After having the game open for some time, there will be some weird audio bugs and some lag. A game restart easily fixes that. There is no auto attack while moving option, which is weird since there isn't a way to harm friendly targets. That would easily be my biggest gripe about the game. Lastly, there isn't an option to zoom out that I've found, which makes it a little difficult to see what is coming up at times. Overall, I'd happily recommend this game for most gamers who like to grind and enjoy quirky humor. Solid 8/10.			"

												TL;DR: Great frantic squad-based shoot-'em up with tons of customization options, random items galore, awesome sprite artwork, a slight learning curve for the controls, some bugs, a fantastic bar complete with great in-house band, randomness galore, invasions, and it's even better online coop with friends(except the random prisoner quests that lag like crazy).So.....What is ""A-move"" or ""attack move"" that everyone is complaining about?  It's a queue-style command in other Real-Time Strategy games like Starcraft where players push a keybind(usually A) that puts their selected characters in Attack mode, and when the next move command is given, those characters will attack anything while moving to the target location.  It becomes tedious and extremely spammy spam, and yet you are forced to do this (in Starcraft 2) if you want to get better.At first, I was like everyone else complaining: ""Where's my A-move!?""  ""Why are my units just standing there?""  And now after almost 20 hours of play, I'm actually glad there's no A-move or auto attack(aggressive mode)  It just makes it have a little bit of a learning curve, and I had to play around with the keybindings a few times until I felt comfortable controlling my squad.  Things get hectic quick, especially on Hardcore mode(perma death).  Also, there is a Tactical Mode(PAUSE - only in single player) for those that like to stop and issue commands.If A-Move and/or auto-attack are added, please make them options, maybe in a Casual difficulty setting.  I don't want to be forced into having to play that way now that I've actually learned how to much better micro my squad members.  If you want to get better at this game, make every effort to SWITCH through and individually control your squad.  With practice, you will realize that your don't WANT your high crit squad member taking 1 of its only 2 shots from its rocket launcher on that mob that would have otherwise died to a small pistol shot and now has to spend another 5 seconds reloading, etc etc.  And A-move or auto-attack would take a lot of fun out of the frantic battles, since it would become just another typical strategy game in which you can just select ALL squad members, and A-move to victory. So yeah, if you want a challenge, and don't mind putting in a little effort learning how to micro-manage better and more efficiently, this game will be extremely fun for you!  If you just want to Auto-Attack-Move or want your Squad to Automatically do everything for you, look elsewhere.  The artwork, animations, sounds, music, systems, ui, and design are top-notch.  Questing and story elements, meh, could be much better.  Although I do love some of the random characters I've stumpled upon.  RV BBQ on an alien planet anyone? "

												I have played this game singleplayer about 5 hours and multiplayer ~3 hours with 2 friends. I like that you have to spend as much time managing your crew and loot as killing enemies on planets. I love games where there are alot of loot, and with the modifiers it gets even better!Edit: The fact that there is no auto attack is not a problem for me as you only have to click once per enemy if there was auto attack it would not be any challenge at all. You would only have to manage your abilities which would be very boring. I have encountered some bugs here is a list: -On one mission when I beamed down to the planet I got the reward immediately after I spoke to a guy who wanted me to help his imprisoned friends (I guess the prison camps did not load in). -Another bug was when I played multiplayer with my friends. It started lagging like crazy, in other words the frames dropped alot.-I'm not sure if this is a bug or not but when I played multiplayer and everyone's crew was dead we could resurrect them even though none of us were alive, and we were still on the planet.Improvements to be made:Some abilities which are not only one click away like the engineers multibot or turretbot, which you have to manually place down. It is kind of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to be honest, because you clear a room pretty fast so it's really no use to put it down, only a waste of time. I think you should have auto deploy on some abilities which take longer time to use, otherwise no one will ever use them.The UI in the ship menu should have a toggle for the ""3d effect"" as it's annoying (I'm not talking about the fact that the UI moves a bit with your cursor, but a toggle for that could be implemented too).Every crewmember's ability should be accessible without the need of choosing the right character. Because when you click the character the other ones get deselected and you will find yourself only attacking the enemy with one crewmember.Overall a really fun game to play alone or with someone but it needs alot of polishing. If you like loot based 2d adventure games I will recommend it to you.			"

												Game gets challenging later on, You do have the ability to increase the difficulty per mission, its nice when your playing multiplayer and your breezing through the game. Alot of item drops like in ARPGs... So expect ARPG styled loot some really like this, some don't. In single player you have the ability to pause the game and give commands to your units, there is usually one auto cast ability and then the rest you have to manually do this. There is no auto attacking which can make the game a bit annoying to play when you have a larger squad. No pausing in multiplayer but if you play with 4 people you will each have 2 units to control which makes the game much easier to play. Some people complain about Item management but let me just say that all you have to do is not pick up commons and uncommons (exactly what you would do in ARPGS) and your fine.			"

												Fun and Addictive, in 2 play sessions im over 8 hours of play time...Cool pixel graphics, nice effects in both visual and sound.I find the game Fun and well worth the money, I recommend it.A lot of party comp customization.A decent amount of skill customization.A little ship customization.I have not tried multiplayer yet...Basic grind cycle of game,-Fly around in galaxy map select mission/loot run, by heading to a planet-Do a mission/loot run 5-15 minutes.-Sort through Loot 5-15 minutes.-Fly to next mission.Loot Mechanics-Similar to Diablo, dungeon defenders or boarderlands.-Does not need as much time to complete loot runs like other loot games.-You do get a TON of loot early on, probably too much...-You will spend a LOT of time outfiting your party after each run.-You will likely swap almost every peice of gear for each party member after each run.-Once you hit level 18 or so, it seems you finally start keeping items for longer than 1 or two missions.Story / Gameplay- With my 8 hours in, the story hasnt progressed too much...- It may just feel that way because its not very forceful, you are free to do whatever you want.- I did do my first boss fight for the first essense and It was much more of a challenge and fun than normal combat.Combat / Gameplay- You have multiple privateers in your party and you control them as a group.- Every privateer has 1 skill they will auto-use and a few others that need your manual usage.- Its not obvious at first how to use the manual skills of all 5 of the privateers but they will pop up on the screen (like over the enemy) and you can click it without actually controlling that privateer.- example, one skill needs 5 stacks of a debuff to hit on an enemy before you can activate the skill (kinda like a finisher)- example2, one skill you can place a turret, there is an icon under that privateer in the game world that you can click and then click on the game world to place the turret.

												This is a great game that is definately worth your time and money!! Just starting out it will ask you a couple questions on which perks you want to take that will affect your game. For example do you want a ship that's more of a tank with turrets? or do want a smaller ship that gives you an extra crew member. I love that because it makes your game more unique.  It is also more worth playing through the tutorial then just jumping in because it will give you extra research points that you spend on class abilities (But if you just jump in to the game then it assumes you know what you are doing and you will have to go out and get that to gain those points). The game play is really fun where you can request missions and fly around the planet while you risk jumping into random events like running into a pirate ship, another ship is stranded or taken over etc. You warp down to different planets and gain new weapons and materials to research to unlock and better understand. If this at all sounds like what you are looking for then this is a must have!			"

												One of the most plesant surprises of 2017! At first, I believed that this game would be a clone of Pixel Piracy when I saw the game being advertised on Facebook.  Being the developers of Terraria, I given them a few chances with the games they developed but Pixel Piracy did not fit my taste very well. Pixel Privateers adventures very familiar toward that game, however, it brings about elements that effectively seperates itself from its predecessor, such as a faster-pace action, solid enemies that are easier to identify and attack, and other elements that makes players want to continue.Pros:The game give enough time for the player to become versed with the terms of the world.  Initially starting out to be a very easy runthrough of the game, the Tutorial is a very basic but extremely necessary component of the game, explaining detail that often would have been too complex for the player to grasp on their own. Additionally from the get-go, the game gives you enough crewmates to manage battles and task that is easy to grasp and understand at the onset. The loot-based perspective adds a lot to the game, as find a weapon that is quite stronger then the other previous weapons found is always satisfying to say the least. Moreso, players can chooose to clone a weapon at a percentage-success rate that will allow more than one of the crewmates to have access to those weapons, which allows the player to progress through the game without being farming the same level over again, a thorn with many loot-based games.Secondly, the ability to change the difficulty at the whim of the players discression allows the player to decide how complex they want their battles to be; be warned, enemies found at the higher difficulties are enough to descimate the least-prepared players wandering at the difficulty level. I find that the amount of item drops are necessary for what the game is trying to achieve; as such, I have no complaints on that end.Cons:For the amount of time I spend with the playthough, gold seemed scarse until I was able to click on the the computer screen on the planets and ended up with $50,000 in my storage, with more comming as I continued to search. This amount seems to be a bit too much as I was able to buy as much as I please without limit, which it should not be THAT forgiving to acquire gold. Additionally, having my shield units sustain aggro with some of the monsters did not seems as effective as my units in the back were getting pelted by the monster that completely bypassed my shields.  As other players have suggested, the text is a bit too small, and sometimes certain explanation did not come accross clearly to me, which an explanation of how to access certain options or a help menu to go over some of the items covered in the tutorial would have been excellent.Lastly, I would recommend this game as it is worth the purchase.

												Great little game. Sort of reminds me of FTL in some ways, since you travel the map in your (somewhat) customizable ship with a crew you slowly level up. Normal mode has been pretty easy so far, though it's slowly getting tougher and I've had a few guys die on me. Overall I'd say it's a good buy for the current price; the maps are pretty quick so you can do a planet or two when you've got time, drop it, come back later and do more without a big time commitment.

												Pixel Privateers is a game, which much lives by the loot you recieve.The loots feels very satisfying and  has a proper amount of rarity types (common, uncommon, rare, epic, mystic,  legendary, artifact) which are nicely color coded. The drop rate from legendary and artifact feels low enough to be excited if they drop.The stats of the loot also seems to be well randomized and you can see the differences in the items you equip. The difficutly of each mission can be changed as well, to increase chance for good loot.However, escpecially late, the game feels a bit too easy even on highest difficulty the final boss was no real challenge. Some customization also comes with your ship, which can be equiped with different rooms and guns, and you can buy bigger ships as well. However, the ship defence missions I did not enjoy that much. After beating him, the game starts anew in NG+, which allows you to keep your characters.So looting is fun and you get used to the combat system, which doesn't allow auto attacks or attack moves.The randomization of the missions/plants is done well, too but might get old after some hours spend in the game. However, the game has some problems as well: In one boss fight later in the game I experienced some pretty low fps.One stair tile on one plante was bugged and diden't allow proceeding on that map. Right clicking to treval to a planet on the galaxy map didn't work for me.All in all the game is fun enough to overlook those flaws and I would recommend it to any fan of loot based games. There are enough enemy types, different classes to play and equip to keep you entertained for at least 10 h (imo) thus the asking price of about 13 euros seems to be fair.			"

												For those of you who cringe a little thinking this is going to be as bad as Pixel Piracy don't . This one is pretty good . You don't play this for it's story tho as there is no real story here . You play this for its simple combat and loot ♥♥♥♥♥ing .The game has a decent foundation to build on .The only Cons I see are#1 Game needs Larger ships and the actual ability to BUILD them .#2 It's a space game with 0 space combat , ships just a pillbox for crew .#3 We can clone people replicate weapons , but cant actually craft our own gear and weapons ? TFStill for what it is its pretty good overall and worth the little they are asking for . Or you can wait for a sale if you walk on your elbows looking for change on the ground LoL .			"

												Great fun and everything, but for the love of god, fix foreground terrain! My guys are dying left and right to enemies that can't be clicked on, and I keep getting pick-up-x-amount-of-this-item-missions where I can't pick up the last thing because there's a rock or a tree in the foreground preventing me from clicking on it. This is basic stuff, guys. Come on!Other than that, great game, 10/10 would recommend again!			"

												Overview: You control a privateer ship that does things in the galaxy, almost like XCOM. You can buy bigger ships, customize the rooms for different functions. Lay various traps and build defense points for when there are random invade events. There are five attributes that can affect character parameters (e.g. speed affects dodge and firerate) and these are fixed. Leveling up grants skill points to spend on these attributes. Classes arent fixed and can be switch anytime by equipping different ""utility pieces"". Given that you have matter, you can clone any character or equipment. The main flow of the game is regulated by missions, which you need to manually get from a menu, and navigate your ship in a galaxy mapped out in grids. Most of the game revolves around getting more loot and raising a more powerful squad so you can take on even stronger enemies.Conclusion:A good rpg that's set in a pixelated world. Get it if you have an appetite for some loot and farming. Bugs and annoyances are there, but given the cheap price and solid gameplay its easy to overlook them. However, if you are not a fan of farming/minmaxing, you will not enjoy this title and its better if you pass this one.PROS:1. Fairly big world - All the planets and missions left me in a state of exhaustion, and there's still a huge blacked out portion of the galaxy unexplored.2. Tons and Tons of equipment and guns - There's a million ways to kit out your team and multiple paths to take even with the same class. The same vanguard could dish out pain or soak up damage depending on how you build him.3. Quite aesthetically pleasing. The maps are pretty and looks detailed. I did find it becoming a tad repetitive as I come across the same tilesets though. Camera shake is conveniently an option that you can toggle on/off.4. Customizable difficulty to determine how ""tryhard"" you want to play this game.CONS:1. Clunky menus - A stark contrast to the clean and well designed game map is the projector menus on your ship. If you have one artifact grade weapon and can't use the SELL ALL button, you'd have to spend an eternity clicking SELL for each piece of junk you want to sell. To compare weapons you have to hover over each of the 50 guns that just dropped from the last mission and check if something could replace old equipment.2. Unergonomic squad controls - Each class had an active skill that you had to access through: Pausing the game, Look for him by scrolling through F1-F8, Look for skill in skillbar, Press correct button. Luckily you can minimize micro-management by putting passive abilities on all but a few of your squadmates. Do this to save your sanity.3. Autosave and no way to undo a stupid mistake - To fly your ship and do missions you need Material and Fuel. If ever you run out of those two things at the same time your whole squad is dead/ your ship is in the middle of nowhere, its GGWP and straight out GAME OVER.4. Music is a hit and miss. Most of the hours will be spent in listening to Bang Bang Bang Boom Boom Boom and watching explosions and bullets fly across the screen.5. A not so inspiring story coupled with lack of variation with mission types. Sure when the squad sets foot on a new planet a different title appears (e.g. release all prisoneers, locate nerve cords...etc.), but it always ends with killing everything. Could really use a break like a plot twist or puzzle.			"

Product received for free
												Overall-In the short time I've been playing i have absolutely feel in love with this game. Its simple and entertaining,  full of customization, weapons ( though generally speaking its the same but different looks and effects), outfits, can customize your ship.  Combat is simple. Depending on how you have your crew set up you can all be melee or all ranged, hell mix it up. Have a dud with a shot gun and turrets another with a great ax, one with a sniper rifle and another wield a SMG in each hand. There are tons of different choices. Story/quest- like most RPG's choices you make during conversation dictate what happens. Its all straight forward to so you can tell what will happen. As for the actual story I'm sorry to say i haven't really been playing it if there is one, a friend got the game and me and him just fly around to different planets killing stuff and collecting loot. (Still super fun)Combat- point and click and your crew attacks. Im still learning everything and idk if there is an auto attack or not. Combat overall is entertaining and challenging. Crew set up is really important as different members have different skills that will ultimately make or break you.Skills- character each get three-four(cant remember) skills. On top of that you have the ability to research things that are the equivalent to perks in a science research. Just tons of fun and anyone who is looking for something new and fun this game is it. Enjoy and let me know what you think of the review please.			"

												Really fun game, it sinks it's hook in you and you can't put it down. I've noticed there certainly needs to be some balancing changes, and there really is way too much loot to deal with after every mission... But even as I'm writing this the devs have released a patch changing some of these minor issues, they're listening to people. Give this game a month or twos worth of updates and it'l be a perfect little gem.			"

												This game is tons of fun in the short amount of time I have played. I've read a few of the other reviews left here and I have to say most of them agree.While the game is fun I only found a couple things that take away from the experience.1. The amount of cash you earn is by far more than needed early game.2. Stats aren't exactly clear in how they work/or what stats are better for what class.3. No true tutorial.4. There are a lot of menus, but it's just a matter of getting used to them.Aside from those things this game is honestly great.1. You get to shoot some mofos in the face2. Some humor mixed in with a decent story line.3. TONS of planets to visit4. Difficulty directly influences drops and exp earned. (chosen before landing on a planet)5. Tons of loot (I'm gonna go into this one a bit more here)   - A lot of people are saying there is too much loot. I beg to differ. Depending on how you're playing the game. Loot can be used for 3 things. 1) Upgrade character gear, 2) Sold for money, 3) Disintegrated for Matter    - Since matter is used for things like reviving characters and beaming down to planets it kind of balances itself. When converting gear into matter you get the weight of the gear back into matter. The heaviest items tend to be Heavy Armor (Weird huh?) So in order for me to revive 1 character (which costs around 50 matter atm) I sometimes need to disintegrate 30 items (Item weight can be anywhere from 0-30 from what I've seen so far) So yes. Tons of loot. Which I love.6. 5 Classes each with different abilities7. Skill trees for each class8. Menus that make sense although there are a lot9. Ships that can be customized (Not super in depth customization but I'm sure with enough feedback this could change)10. You aren't always overpowered.This list could go on but I'll leave it there. I'm currently at level 26. There were a couple times where  I felt I was overpowered even playing on harder difficulties but then a planet came along that royaly screwed me up. So yeah, I learned. LolIt's a really enjoyable game for its current price I don't think it's a bad investment. If you're hesitant, just wait for a better sale. But for me, worth the money.			"

												Fun and Addictive, in 2 play sessions im over 8 hours of play time...Cool pixel graphics, nice effects in both visual and sound.I find the game Fun and well worth the money, I recommend it.A lot of party comp customization.A decent amount of skill customization.A little ship customization.I have not tried multiplayer yet...Basic grind cycle of game,-Fly around in galaxy map select mission/loot run, by heading to a planet-Do a mission/loot run 5-15 minutes.-Sort through Loot 5-15 minutes.-Fly to next mission.Loot Mechanics-Similar to Diablo, dungeon defenders or boarderlands.-Does not need as much time to complete loot runs like other loot games.-You do get a TON of loot early on, probably too much...-You will spend a LOT of time outfiting your party after each run.-You will likely swap almost every peice of gear for each party member after each run.-Once you hit level 18 or so, it seems you finally start keeping items for longer than 1 or two missions.Story / Gameplay- With my 8 hours in, the story hasnt progressed too much...- It may just feel that way because its not very forceful, you are free to do whatever you want.- I did do my first boss fight for the first essense and It was much more of a challenge and fun than normal combat.Combat / Gameplay- You have multiple privateers in your party and you control them as a group.- Every privateer has 1 skill they will auto-use and a few others that need your manual usage.- Its not obvious at first how to use the manual skills of all 5 of the privateers but they will pop up on the screen (like over the enemy) and you can click it without actually controlling that privateer.- example, one skill needs 5 stacks of a debuff to hit on an enemy before you can activate the skill (kinda like a finisher)- example2, one skill you can place a turret, there is an icon under that privateer in the game world that you can click and then click on the game world to place the turret.

												A definite step up from Pixel Piracy. The game has solid grinding mechanics, all stats are useful for all characters, the loot is interesting as once you get past the first 10 or so levels, the choices between them develop into more than choosing what has the higher stat block. Each class is useful and valuable. It does have its flaws. After having the game open for some time, there will be some weird audio bugs and some lag. A game restart easily fixes that. There is no auto attack while moving option, which is weird since there isn't a way to harm friendly targets. That would easily be my biggest gripe about the game. Lastly, there isn't an option to zoom out that I've found, which makes it a little difficult to see what is coming up at times. Overall, I'd happily recommend this game for most gamers who like to grind and enjoy quirky humor. Solid 8/10.			"

												TL;DR: Great frantic squad-based shoot-'em up with tons of customization options, random items galore, awesome sprite artwork, a slight learning curve for the controls, some bugs, a fantastic bar complete with great in-house band, randomness galore, invasions, and it's even better online coop with friends(except the random prisoner quests that lag like crazy).So.....What is ""A-move"" or ""attack move"" that everyone is complaining about?  It's a queue-style command in other Real-Time Strategy games like Starcraft where players push a keybind(usually A) that puts their selected characters in Attack mode, and when the next move command is given, those characters will attack anything while moving to the target location.  It becomes tedious and extremely spammy spam, and yet you are forced to do this (in Starcraft 2) if you want to get better.At first, I was like everyone else complaining: ""Where's my A-move!?""  ""Why are my units just standing there?""  And now after almost 20 hours of play, I'm actually glad there's no A-move or auto attack(aggressive mode)  It just makes it have a little bit of a learning curve, and I had to play around with the keybindings a few times until I felt comfortable controlling my squad.  Things get hectic quick, especially on Hardcore mode(perma death).  Also, there is a Tactical Mode(PAUSE - only in single player) for those that like to stop and issue commands.If A-Move and/or auto-attack are added, please make them options, maybe in a Casual difficulty setting.  I don't want to be forced into having to play that way now that I've actually learned how to much better micro my squad members.  If you want to get better at this game, make every effort to SWITCH through and individually control your squad.  With practice, you will realize that your don't WANT your high crit squad member taking 1 of its only 2 shots from its rocket launcher on that mob that would have otherwise died to a small pistol shot and now has to spend another 5 seconds reloading, etc etc.  And A-move or auto-attack would take a lot of fun out of the frantic battles, since it would become just another typical strategy game in which you can just select ALL squad members, and A-move to victory. So yeah, if you want a challenge, and don't mind putting in a little effort learning how to micro-manage better and more efficiently, this game will be extremely fun for you!  If you just want to Auto-Attack-Move or want your Squad to Automatically do everything for you, look elsewhere.  The artwork, animations, sounds, music, systems, ui, and design are top-notch.  Questing and story elements, meh, could be much better.  Although I do love some of the random characters I've stumpled upon.  RV BBQ on an alien planet anyone? "
