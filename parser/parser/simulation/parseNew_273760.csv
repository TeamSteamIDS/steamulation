This 2015 version of Towtruck Simulator seems to only have marginal additions over Astragon's 2010 version of Tow Truck Simulator, but at the price of some things that made the older version fun. It makes you wonder why UIG even bothered.In the past you could drive like a maniac with your car hanging off the side, rushing around to get all the cars back to your lot, just left to your own devices to do as you please. This time you must do everything prim and proper until you're even allowed to drive the truck away. I never got that as far as to drive away with the car on the back as I couldn't figure out how to get the truck moving again and in that time the car I had put on the truck had somehow slid it's way off. They focused so much on the physics of the hydraulic stabilizers it seems they didn't have time for much else.There is no tutorial to guide you through each bit, you're merely given a control screen (controls cannot be customized) and you just have to figure out what to do from there. It doesn't explain things such as what you have to do for the game to trigger to allow you to do the next bit. It's a pretty big thing to overlook really considering the linearity of the game. You're wrapped up in cotton wool to avoid you being silly but doesn't really tell you how to be a great tow truck guy either.This game is graphics glitches galore. As you view cars in the distance it looks like a scene out of Tokyo Drift as they seem to be sliding down the road at an angle until they come into your draw distance and dissolve away revealing the car that's meant to be there. Everyone on the roads drives at 2mph, yet the sounds in the game would make you believe you were in the middle of Manhattan. It's not uncommon to see the same car several times in one scene, in fact you can even see that in the screenshots! The only thing that differs between them is some cars have shadows and some do not. Spooky!This game has a star style wanted level system taken straight from GTA. I don't know why it's there or what it does though. It just made a police siren sound and that was it. Not a cop in sight. I can't tell you if it has replay value or what the rest of the game is like as I couldn't figure out how to get that far. It feels rushed and hastily put together. If you want a tow truck simulator game just find the older version made by Astragon in your local charity shop or on ebay.			"

												I thought I would try this out for a bit of a laugh, not really my cup of tea, but boy was I disappointment way more than what I expected. I will probably NEVER play this game because of the poor quality. It is a shame, but they have reasonable graphics, but a lot of the time you find you have the car on the truck, but the game refuses to accept it and you just waste your time trying to resolve the issue. Some of the physics in the game are so bad also, for no reason the truck will just flip upside down. The driving control is bad and there is absolutely no way to remap the keys in the game at all. Just going into the options shows the sheer lack of settings. There is no tutorial in the game, so you spend about an hour trying to work out how the bloody thing is supposed to work before you get a grip of the controls and then find out it ignores the fact when you do things right also. There doesn't seem to be anyway of knowing your progression also, just says pick up cars marked with RED dot, then half of them are too heavy and no way to know how to earn a larger truck.Very POOR game in my opinion and certainly one for the masses to AVOID. When you think ONE GUY created Banished, what was the organisation thinking of to launch such a game in todays market place?It is a shame that Steam does not offer a ""Game Guarantee"" for satisfaction of a game for valued customers like myself to obtain a refund. If a member of staff reads this review, then please consider it, or at the very least remove this game from sale and save other customers the traumer!			"

												This game is buggy, flawed and seems unfinished. The crane is too slow, it is unrealistic and needs a lot of work to get it right. It should be called Towtruck Simulator 2005. It is that out of date.			"

												I spent 20 minutes trying to pick up an SUV. I got the crane and everything lined up perfectly but it just wasn't picking the damn SUV up.Everything in this game is just horrible, the crane controls are slow as hell, the driving is horrible, NPC vehicles are horrible, the map/word is horrible and theres only like 3 trucks in the whole game.I got this game because it was included in a bundle, and I paid about 3,50€ for the bundle (it included like 10 games or so).For everybody who is thinking about buying this game, DON'T. This is a big waste of money.			"

												I love simulator games, but Towtruck Simulator 2015 gave me a head ache, both  as a simulation game and literally; I had to lay down and close my eyes for  half an hour  after playing this game.  The first thing that struck me was the un-responsivness of the controls.  It feels like you are travelling through treacle all the time.  Even though the speedo shows that you are doing   60kph,  you feel like you are crawling, with no variation in  the speed of the vehicle apart from when you first accelerate from  stationary, and even that was unrealistic.  All other vehicles on the road apart from looking remarkably similar (there was very little variation in color and only several different models of car, with no other HGV or  articulated vehicles  appaent in game),   travel at the same slow speed;  and,  if you happen to crash into  any car, despite driving  a  5 or 6 ton vehicle at speed,  the   car appears to be glued to the road as it doesn't budge an inch when you crash into it .  Cars   appearing in the distance seemed  to slide and even jump about , and movement when turning corners was erratic and unrealistic. Other vehicle simulators like Euro Truck Simulator 1 & 2  at least have  some modicum of realism (apart from actual crash damage) when you crash into other vehicles.  The map showing you the  placement of  cars that needed towing isn't very clear and  so far I've not found a key binding  that will allow me to  zoom in on the map, and  on top of all these issues  the whole environment looks drab and reminds me of what in game environments looked like  10 years ago, not  next year (as in the games title Tow Truck Simulator 2015).  Finally, try actually picking up  a vehicle once you've found one, it's not impossible, but  I tried and failed several times. There's a basic plan of the controls via the F1 key *see the last image link posted below), but  there's no actual  tutorial, so trying to actually pick up  a vehicle for the first time is pretty hard to figure out unless you have a PhD in mechanical engineering.  After playing the game for a couple of hours I  had to gave up. (I did  returned briefly  to  check on some points while writng this  review) .  In my opinion  Tow Truck Simulator 2015  was a  throughly unpleasant game to play.Thankfully I got this game (twice) via  both Bundle Star  sim bundles, so can't really complain about how much I  wasted as there were some decent sims  games included  with each of the bundles I purchased. You can see some images (taken by me) and a You Tube video posted by WhyBeHere below:

You can check this out yourself by comparing  game play from each game via You Tube videos.   In essence  I'd much rather be playing the  2010 version than the  2015 version.  e.g. Other vehicles look  like they travel faster, the cars  can be knocked off the road if you crash into them which means if you get stuck in traffic   you can at least plow a path through  cars being driven along the roads if needed, wheras in the 2015 version, you easily get trapped between  oncoming   vehicles and vehicles behind you because of the   cars   being stuck to the road (see the third image above, I was completely stuck at this point after trying to extricate myself from  the vehicle  pile up ;......well, not really a pile up). The only way to get out of the game was to  restart;  game saves seem to be disables as I wasn't able to save my progress.    Also the collision mesh  leaves a lot to be desired, with my truck being able to partly  drive through  various  inanimate objects like tree trunks.I doubt I'll ever  play this game again  because I've got much better   and more realistic simulation games to  enjoy.  Even GTA V (X-Box version) has a usable tow truck that operates much better and that's only one very tiny aspect of that particular game.			"

												I bought it out of shear curiosity, wondering how terrible the game really was because let's be honest here, no game has terrible reviews without positive ones. I soon found out that my tow truck has an extra chromosome and cannot lift its own arm. The vehicle physics are something you would find in a driving simulator from 2002. You have more fun downloading the game and laughing at how horrid it really is than actually playing it. Honestly, only buy it when its 90% off because its only worth 99 cents of laughs. Absolutely trash game, will never play it again in my lifetime.			"

												The tow truck shown on the ""cover"" or ""box"" of this game, isn't the same type of tow truck in the game.  The game tow truck is a lift - maybe Euro style?  The cover shows a ramp n chain style tow truck.....was hoping for multiple trucks, but only thing they give you is lift.  :(  Would have liked to see Hook n Chain, boom style for Semis, ramp n chain, etc.  Not worth the buy at this time.  Seems like a Beta.....			"

												Tow Truck Simulator.Sounds like an idea from the garbage can, and yes - it could have been a decent sim game (of which we recently had so many).To say you the truth, it isn't a decent simulation - some of the controls are really messed up, like the crane. Even if you manage to load your truck, you don't get too far with it. Yes, the control is awkward, slow, and not very precise. It is ruining even the meager rest of fun you might get from trying to load one car on your truck. The graphics are mediocre, and some of the higher settings use up a lot of processor power even on high end machines.I can give only recomendation to people who really like that kind of ""sims"", it is not a game that will be a good sim collection start. And it surely is not a game for people with a low frustration threshold. It can drive you outright nuts, especially the control of the crane (the worst thing I experienced was when I tried to put the car onto the truck, and the game didn't let me because the tolerance of the programing was really, really bad). Also there is some other issue, on my notebook the game crashes. There seems to be an issue with some graphic systems, mine was an older notebook nVidia onboard solution. On my normal PC though, there is not such an issue.So buy this game only if you are a hardcore sim fan, who likes to simulate everything imaginable (I am still waiting for a ""Stick in the mud""-Sim...) All others, get out of the line, it might not be worth your time.			"

												First of all, let me start by saying that I would NEVER purchase this game by choice, the only reason I own it is because of a Simulator Bundle I purchased a while ago, and I figured that since I now own Towtruck Simulator 2015, I might as well give it a play to see what it's like. After less than 20 minutes of playing this game, I have concluded that it is nothing short of a joke. Right off the bat it takes a huge nose-dive. There are no introductions, no tutorials on how to use the controls or hotkeys and the game is bugged horrendously, even the menus and dialogs are really bad. This is a very clearly unfinished game and the fact that it was released in it's current state is an utter disgrace. I honestly think that a group of 10 year old kids could come up with a more polished game than this in a shorter amount of time. This is the perfect example of ""Shovelware"", the game is an unoptimised mess, the controls are clunky to say the least and very clear issues have been completely overlooked. It seems as though this game was never even tested before it's release, but that wouldn't surprise me. United Independent Entertainment have become famous for their unplayable games. I didn't expect much from this game from the beginning, Towtruck Simulator doesn't necessarily sound like something I would enjoy, nor does it sound like a game with much promise, but this is just ridiculous and the fact that they are asking for £10.99 for it on the Steam page is even more ridiculous. Do NOT buy this game, not even during the Steam Sales. The only reason any of you should ever own this game is from a Bundle Package like how I acquired it.			"

												Being a second generation former tow truck driver i can honestly say that nothing in this game depicts the realism of the tow truck life, My dad was a tow truck driver in The Bronx (NYC) and used flatbeds for long distances and special tows like a car that would be considered totaled.This game only uses a flatbed tow truck and uses a arm that i can only imagine in a scrap yard. Real  tow trucks are pick up trucks with a custom hydrolic lift or a actual tow truck that already has hydrolics built in. Options menu doesnt have any kind of customizations in regards to graphical tuning and some of the audio was down to 0 which made me think the games audio was broken until i figured out what happen, But the graphics suck, Crashing into cars doesnt cause any kind of damage to your truck or the car, The cars physics in the game are very wonky and realistic. No different camera views which is a real shame.I was hoping this game would play like Euro truck sim 2 but with tow trucks and with a deep customization learning curve,Maybe even get to experience the ""Chase"" life, but all i got was a game that feels very unfinished. And with controller and wheel support.  "

												This game is so bad, if you'd call it garbage, it would be a praise, I think.It performs terrible, it starts in a 1680x1009 window on my dual-monitor desktop and the UI remains scaled for that resolution (i.e. things are off screen if you change it to 1280x1204), the options menu does barely deserve being called that, the gameplay is a joke, and the look&feel is immediately repelling, it performs poorly for what it renders, and it supports no input devices but the keyboard, and the mouse to rotate the camera.My conclusion is, the quality of the game is not worth a single penny in this day and age.This game is adding to the long list of crap from UIG/PlayWay.

												TL;DR: It's crap. And the reason: The simulator is flawed and doesn't work. Furthermore there is no form of tutorial or a readme file showing you the controls to the game. Nor can you reconfigure the controls in the game. Don't buy unless you like crap.			"

												WARNING:  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!Don’t let my play time fool you folks, I’ve actually never played this game.  I just sat at my computer clicking the “play” button until I had 5 minutes worth of time.  Why?  Because like so many others I have not been able to start the game.  Don't believe me?  Go look at the forums...  I'll wait for you to return.So now that you believe me, let's get a little more detailed here.  My computer far exceeds the system requirements for this game.  I have over 80 other games in my collection that run just fine.  I have all the required addon software (Directx & PhysX) for this game, and even tested different versions.  My drivers are always fully updated.  The game just won’t start.  I’ve even tried using different compatibility (and administrator) modes!  It... won’t... start.That said, there are some people out there who have been “fortunate” to get it to run.  What do they report?  Graphics are horrible, collision detection is bad, controls are stupid, and the game lags terribly for no reason.  To sum it up, this game is absolute garbage!  Don’t waste your money on this folks.  Even if you think it might be interesting.  If you have the money to waste you would be better off going to the bank, withdrawing that $15, and using it as toilet paper.  At least the money would have had a purpose.  Do NOT buy this game!			"

												I'll go down the list of featues here...Huge city with dozens of parking slots, streets and parks -Okay, I'll give them this. The map is decently sized, although if the vehicles moved more quickly it would feel much smallerHard city traffic with traffic lights and hundreds of cars-The roads are mostly emptyVarious Tow Trucks with crane and ramp -Two crane trucks (small and large) and one ramp truck...Simulation of all hydraulic functions -At slower than real speed!3 game modes-Finally, something true Realistic sound effects and atmospheric music-Okay, the first time I launched the game I had no sound whatsoever. It turns out sound is muted by default. If you have sound on at all you get what sounds like someone sitting at the side of the road with a mic, just cars driving by, no matter where you are. The vehicles make no sounds whatsoever. The horn is a different pitch every time you hit it, as is the handbrake sound (spacebar) even though the handbrake does nothing. The music is terrible, too.High score list for all game modes-Sure, whateverThe game is actually decent, but wanting money for it is insulting. It feels like a beta version at best. Your truck and all the hyrdaulic systems are stupidly slow to the point that you get bored and just give up. I'm glad I'm not the one that paid for this.			"

												The VerdictTowtruck Simulator 2015 is a great overall package that has a ton of content to enjoy. The multiplayer modes are largely based on what was established by Modern Warfare, but the twists that Treyarch throws in work well. My biggest issue with the multiplayer is that the new Wager Matches, while fun in their own right, don't compare favorably to the high-quality and addictive leveling system and game modes from Towtruck Simulator 2015 1 and 2. Single-player is as exhaustingly fast-paced as ever with large set pieces that try to take the attention off of the lackluster AI of both friends and enemies. That withstanding, the story is the best I've ever seen from a Towtruck Simulator. Couple both of those substantial offerings with more Zombie content than some full-fledged zombie games and Towtruck is certainly worth your time, even if you aren't already a fan of the series.10/10 - IGN			"

Honestly - why all the negative reviews?Good: Its a tow truck simulator!Bad: List too long, cant be bothered writingHowever - C'mon, did people really expect this to be good?I had fun regardless - took about 30 minutes to attempt picking up the first car, then gave upspent 30 minutes on another vehicle, picked it up, placed on truck, couldnt let go of car and therefore couldnt drive away... flipped the car upside down somehow and managed to tip my truck onto its side with a white vauxhall astra bouncing in and out of the floor with its wheels becoming one with the roof. was a beautiful site10/10 Needs more glitches and some WD40 on the crane arm (which unpacks very quickly may i add)			"

												5/10 - Another okay-ish game but playable simulatorOne major issue: game says it saved even though it didn't.Gameplay is simplified but not bad. It's just way too slow, the crane arm must move at like 1 meter a decade which makes moving a car a stupidly long task.Still the same PhysX-based engine with really poor performance and funky collisions.Overall not a bad simulator but it's too slow to be really fun. It just ends up boring, and I am a guy that enjoyed Mining & Tunneling Simulator. Don't get it for €15 though, wait for a possible bundle (BundleStars may have it in the future).			"

												JESUS CHRIST THIS GAME IS BAD!!!! WTF did the ""developers"" think???? Is this a school-assignment for high school done in a week? What is up with the sloooooooooooooooooooooooow movement of the crane and other moveable parts? I actually fell asleep trying to get the second car. When I woke up, it said ""game over"". Hot damn this game is so ugly it should have been made in 1993. So glad I got this in a bundle, and actually never wanted it in the first place. Paid about 1 € this so-called-simulator, and it was at least 20€ too much!!! But it does simulate one thing. Developers trying to make a game. FAIL! I really hope Steam take this game out to the trash for good.Btw: Where is the ""Hard city traffic with traffic lights and hundreds of cars""? I only heard a billion cars honking and driving by.			"

												Quite possibly the biggest fail-of-a-game I have ever played.  Horrible graphics and lack of customizable controls and only enjoyable by I honestly can't think of anyone that would enjoy this game.The first time I played I couldn't get the crane to work.The second time I played I found that F1 revealed how to play.  I managed to load a car and while driving back to the yard...the car flew off to the side while I was driving in a straight line and the truck locked it's brakes and that was it.The third (and final) time I played, I picked a car, drove it back to the yard, unloaded it, and the passenger side stabilizer stuck to the pavement...and flipped my truck when I tried to raise it.  I quit.This was part of a twelve game ""bundle"" from some ""stars"" site for $3.99 so not a total loss.  This game should be removed from the Steam catalog.			"

												The controls in this take a bit of getting used to.  The ""F1"" for help wasn't really that helpful either.  I ended up half guessing what the instructions were trying to state.  I both love and hate that all cars that need to be towed are marked on the map, even if your truck cannot tow the darn thing.			"

												The driving is ok and the crane is workable although not without great difficulty. But what breaks the game are the cameras' behaviour. They keep running away from the job (getting further & further) until you can't find the truck or see what you're doing. Save your money; the only reason i got this game is because it came in a bundle.And oh, you can forget about the music, it's definitely not a selling point.Score: 2/10			"

												This game is a joke.. Had to delete and reinstall it 3 times before it would load right. the only controls I can get to work is the drving controls. Did everything it says to to work the crane. Sadly just another poorly made simulation game in a market that is lacking for games like this. The only reason I have it is because it came in a bundle pack I purchased. If I could I would get my money back for this but I am stuck with it so to the black out list it goes to be forgotten about. If I had read the reviews I wouldn't even have wasted my time on this poorly made game. Really wish Valve would start inforcing rules on these things that they have to continue updates fixing bugs or they won't support any more of their products.			"
