												A remake of the classic C64 game Vermeer. So not a board game and should not be confused for one....By building plantations with different crops you're trying to create enough wealth to get the best art collection. To make things intresting there's stock trading, an auction where you try to buy the paintings and scripted events from the historic timeline(early 19th century) that affect markets. For the paintings you also have the option of studying art directions so you can spot fakes. Or to raise price for your competitors who might not even realise what you're doing... Good fun.			"

												What an interesting little gem of a game this is. I had my eyes on Patrician III, as it was well reviewed was on sale for less then a dollar. Then I see it comes in a bundle with two other games. This one, The Great Art Race, perked my interest a bit. Only in a bundle? Not for sale on it's own? It can't be that good then.My mistake completely.What we have here is an extremely solid resource management/board game. Essentially you play as one of five nephews/nieces to a rich uncle, who is terminally ill and wishes one of you to inherit his fortune. The condition? Become insanely wealth and then use said wealth to attend art auctions in hopes of finding and retrieving his stolen artwork. And how does someone become insanely wealthy? By travelling to smaller cities like Bombay, Guatemala, Mexico City and Saint Louis, among others, and buying up land for plantations and hiring workers.There's a pattern to the game. You visit your plantations and pay your workers, ship the goods to London or New York for sale, go to one of those cities to sell them at the market value or sign future dated contracts to sell them at a higher price, and then when all that is done you can find an auction to attend. No auctions? Maybe you can attend an activity for the exclusive social club you're all members of. Horse racing to bet on? Maybe take an expensive expedition in a foreign land in hopes of finding something valuable? Maybe visit your uncle and get drunk with him, or help him re-arrange his salon? This all raises your reputation which can result in you getting a bonus paining at the end of the year.Maybe you can attend an art class to determine if a painting is real or fake (basically allowing you to make sense of the included decoder file)There are two game modes. The main one tasks you with locating the most paintings, with bonuses for all paintings of a series and for the aforementioned bonus paintings. The other tasks you with just having the most assets, with paintings adding to your overall value. Each one can be played against any combination of computer players or human players via hotseat. You can also set the difficulty, and set the length of the game to 2, 5, or 7 years. There's a fair bit of depth here. It's quite fun all in all, even on your own. The music for the cities is catchy, and the colorful graphics and sound effects make it a pleasant audio and visual experience. Having not played either Darkstar One or Patrician III (the other games in the bundle) yet I cannot comment on them but The Great Art Race is so enjoyable it alone is worth the cost of the bundle.

 CompatibilityFirst of all, I ran this remake on a Win10 PC with a NVIDIA GTX 745, and neither did I have problems starting the game nor did it crash once during my 2 hours (short) playthrough.Remake nostalgiaI enjoyed it very much. During the late 80s, I played the original Vermeer on my Schneider CPC6128. I was pleasantly surprised  about this rejuvenated version, its neat graphics, the nicely executed intro and the stylish background music (one for each city you can travel to). Everyone who shares my aforementioned experience with the original should have a fresh look. Gamers who do not have this predisposition for nostalgia might find the game a little simplistic, but it feels quite relaxing nevertheless.GameplayThe goal is to collect famous paintings to please your wealthy uncle, competing with some of your relatives (AI or hotseat multiplayer) for his inheritance. Most of those pieces of art are bought in auction houses all over Europe and the USA, and in order to do that, you need to earn money as a planter in Asia, Africa and the Americas, grow five different crops (tea, coffee, cacao, tobacco as well as silk) and sell them on commodity markets in London and New York. Forward contracts with higher profits, stock exchange, special events and expeditions to exotic places spice up this routine between simple economic simulation and educational collect quest. During the short game, it did not become boring. I am not sure how it would feel to play the long version in one session though. I did not encounter any bugs. It seemed a little confusing at first when the amount of my available funds was automatically increased or decreased (when I ran into debt, the game decided for me that I needed to take a higher bank loan), and the rules what you can and cannot buy when your cash runs out are a little arbitrary (crop transfer yes, plantation upgrades no, worker wages yes, expeditions no...) - coming from the original game where you could not even buy a train ticket without a positive cash balance, I understand that the developers of the remake wanted to avoid the (formerly common) situation that the player got stuck in the middle of nowhere, waiting for a random money gift from your uncle for travel expenses.I cannot write this review without mentioning the beautiful replicas of the paintings and their informative descriptions you can read by inspecting them. I love it when a game has some real-life educational value in addition to the good entertainment.VerdictThe original classic has been modernized and presented in a very appealing way. The game is stable, and it is not expensive. I give it a 7.5/10 and recommend it to Vermeer veterans, friends of the simulation genre who want to try something not too complicated, and to culture vultures who appreciate the art theme.			"

												The Great Art Race is a light, simple, short, and casual strategy game. Once you develop a system for creating cash and being punctual to the auctions, it will be an almost effortless win even on the more advanced difficulty setting. There are some randomized events, but they will not effect the outcome very much. The graphics and presentation are not impressive at all, to say the least. There is very little animation, and minimal sound. It is fun for about two hours or so, keeping in mind there won't be very much of a replay value. Once you're done (and you'll be done quickly), there's not much to go back to. It somehow reminds me of a less fun Jones in the Fast Lane from the early 90s. I played for about 2 hours, and I plan on keeping it installed for the time being, just in case I feel like playing a quick ""coffee break"" game.The Great Art Race is okay.			"

												This is a resource management game where you have to meet certain goals by deadlines whilst carefully watching your and your opponents' money and assets. If you enjoy gameplay similar to East India Company (minus the warfare aspect), then you will probably enjoy this game. Personally, not for me, but don't let my opinion spoil it for you. **			"

												The Great Art Race is an old game that is only available in a package. While flawed in some aspects, it is well worth grabbing if you are into management games. Specifically for this one, time management.The players are the family of the wealthy art collector, explorer, and general high society member Uncle Walter. There are two problems, however. Firstly, your uncle is old. He is nearing the end of his life and is looking for an heir to his fortune. Secondly, his prized art collection has been stolen. All the paintings have gone missing, and are popping up at auctions.He thusly decided that the one to bring back the most of his precious collection would be his heir.This means it is up to you, and up to 4 other family members to get back those paintings. In order to get them you will need to start plantations, get yourself a fortune by producing up to five different crops and selling them in either London or New York. Prices fluctuate, and there are orders placed in advance you can fill for more profit. You can buy shares in the companies who transport these goods, and you can pay your opponent's workers to strike and stop working.Aside from the economic things going on, you have a reputation to uphold. Explore the jungles, adventure in Asia, and bring back fancy figurines and other such interesting things. Bet on horse races, and of course spend time with your uncle before the end.And all of this while still making your way to auctions and having the money needed to buy the paintings.Paintings that could be forgeries. You can luckily take art classes to identify these(A PDF is included with the game, you will need it to check what is real and what is not), at which point you can bid up the price of a forgery if your opponents don't know it is one to make them lose out on money, or you can just let them outbid eachother for millions of dollars on what you know is a fake.The gameplay is mainly about time management, rather than managing your business. Travel across the world is faster than in the age of sail, but it still takes several days to travel anywhere. And that adds up. You can only personally tell your warehouse to ship goods, so you need to be in India to send goods from there to London. And you can only personally pay your workers, but if you don't pay, they stop working. It is all about managing your time, and making sure you are in the right place at the right time while still having enough money to do what you need to do.The greatest of flaws, aside from its age locking it at a smaller resolution than most screens and potentially making it difficult to get it working on some computers, is the multiplayer.By which I mean, the AI are not too great at the game, and the only multiplayer is local multiplayer.It would be a much more enjoyable game if it were one that could be played with friends over the internet.As it is, The Great Art Race is an interesting, somewhat hidden game that is quick to play and finish (About an hour per ingame year), satisfying to get through, and yet leaves you wanting more of it. Assuming of course you can look past the small flaws and slight inconsistencies out there.			"

												This is a resource management game in which you try to inherit your rich Uncle's fortune by retrieving his stolen art collection. Along the way you'll build up a global plantation empire, invest in stocks and hotels, participate in art auctions, and (of course!) sabotage your rivals. For a game that was released in 2009 the graphics are very underwhelming. But graphics aren't everything, and I'll play anything as long as it has an interesting premise. This game's premise of being one of the wealthy elite during the Roaring Twenties appealed to me so I gave it a try.Unfortunately there are some flaws that cause this game to fail. Firstly, there is no in-game tutorial so I had to go hunting for the manual which I eventually found hidden in one of my steam directories. You really need to read the manual before starting the game, otherwise you won't have a clue how to get started.Secondly and most importantly, there are game-stopping bugs. I was running Windows 7 64 bit and had random crashes. I once made it two years into the game but then I got a crash that I couldn't avoid even using the auto-save, so that was it for me.It's a shame, there's 95% of a game here, if they could have just done some more polish it could have been a decent resource management game. But since it came out in 2009 it's doubtful these bugs will be fixed, so I have to give it a thumbs down until further notice.			"

												It is a good game, a great combination of goals and activities, but it needs some serious modification.  It's a great idea.  It completely lacks any sort of tutorial or guide, or pop-up hints, and some of the b.s. you have to deal with is just lamely frustrating, but that doesn't make the game bad.  It's fun to try, I'd like to try the multi-player.  If you're looking for a game to rip-off or plagerixe, this game would be a great starting point.

												I don't know how this got into my library, but it's not what I call a ""welcome suprise"".Edit: It was in some three game ""Patricians and Merchants"" bundle I bought a while back, for just 89p (85% off - it should have been £5.99)..... so ok, this ""TGAT"" cost me just 30p then, but it's still not worth even that! Normal price is £3.99! You do the maths!This is a business strategy game, set in 1918 into the 1920's, where you are in competition with your cousins / siblings to win your dying uncle's entire estates in his will. You do this by racing each other  back and forth across the globe to reclaim as much of his missing art collections as possible. The lucky nephew or niece who gets your unc the most of his paintings back, by the time the old coot finally croaks (which takes from 2 - 7 years) will win Uncle Fkr's entire fortune!Your unc will give you $150k to start with which you will have to use to set up planations in tropical locations, send their produce to either New York or London, and then go there to actually sell the stuff. You then have to go attend auctions across the world when your unc's stolen paintings come up..... and hope you don't buy forgeries. This is all the game has. Other than ""horse racing meets"" that you will lose $10k on every time guaranteed, meaningless ""historical events"" and ""random personal events"" that will do nothing but utterly shag you off! One event in March '18 was ""14,000 bombs dropped on Paris in German airraid"" - even if you are in Paris when this happens, well, NOTHING happens to you, or Paris, no damage is seen - nothing at all..... and 14000 sounds a bit exaggerated for even the biggest WWI zepplin raid!99.9% of the time you spend watching the map screen, and the dates tick by, along with an awful ""snoring"" sound effect, while you endlessly roam the earth and/or wait for your planations to grow ♥♥♥♥. Then it's just endlessly ferrying to and fro your planations, sending stock to NY or London, and then going to NY or London to sell. You often find you have to ""wait"" for several in-game weeks, and you just have to sit there watching the game's map screen..... you can't ""skip it"".Some people seem to claim that setting up ""forward contracts"" automates this plantation produce -> warehouse storage -> sold in NY or London rigmarole. I never tried it. You still have to constantly visit every planation in order to pay it's workers anyway!In short, this game is complete waste of space.Worrying also is every positive review this game has are given FULL-ON 100% posreps and that there are 42 positive reviews vs 21 negative (2 : 1 ratio exactly)..... organised fanboism and ""developer meddling"" if I've ever seen it.

												I expected this game to be about art. Instead, it turned out to be a resource management game. In this game, you compete against your counsins to be the top buyer of legitimate paintings. You start off in 1918 and set off to invest the cash you've been given in stocks and plantations around the world.The many things you do:- Sign forward contracts to sell goods from your plantations- Educate yourself in the arts- Bet on horses (sadly limited to just $10,000 per race)- Bid on art auctions (beware of fakes)Timing is key in this game. Unfortunately, the in-game data management is a bit lacking. I found myself jotting down in a notepad where my plantations were, what was being grown there, required amounts to fulfill open forward contracts, and calculating what I can do between dates.Other notes:Graphics are fine (it's an old game that doesn't need intensive graphics for what you do). The music is pretty fantastic. Very catchy tunes for each city you visit. A few seem out of place for the location. I'm not so certain about the era (not a music expert).Concluding note: this is the kind of game that's entertaining until you figure it out and get the hang of maxing out your cash and meeting deadlines. I'll definitely come back to it some time in the future.			"

Bet on horse races. Sip sherry with your uncle. Mind you, while you are doing all this, WWI in raging across Europe, and French and German towns are aflame. A simple, educational game that just wants to teach your about the various painting styles of the early 20th Century? Or a damning indictment of how only the poor suffer through the horrors of war?

												I had absolutly no knowledge and very low expectations about this game when started this game. Originally I got this game as a part of the Patriciants and Merchant bundle (The Great Art Race  + Darkstar One + Parician III).When I got into the game it suprised me positively. It's nothing world-changing, but it's a fun little game. An interesting blend of tabletop looks and strategy computer games. And has it's own depths too (to buy paintings you need money, witch comes from the plantations, wich need to be looked after, or else it stops producing for this or that reason, than to actually got the paint you have to travel to the auction and outbid the other players, etc...), though you has to get used to some of the game rules.But it's still a pleasent option to kill some time with it, especially if you got only 5-10 minutes or half-an hour to do so. And maybe this is the game's only true problem. It's meant to be played in short bursts, otherwise it easily gets repetitive and tedious.Still, to those, who seek a game that is quick to pick up, easity to return to, with just the right amount of strategizing, very basic economy simulation and the simplistic, stylzied look of a tabletop game, this is the right call for them.

												In this game you have to buy your uncle's paintings from auctions by making money from building plantations in other parts of the world and then shipping and selling your goods in New York and London.It is a new and clever idea for a game in my opinion. I enjoyed playing it but I think there should be more variety. There are only 5 goods that you can produce.Games do not last that long. You can finish a game in about 2 hours on the shortest game type. It is somewhat replayable but I can see this one getting old very quickly because of the lack of variety.I had problems with the game crashing and restarting my PC quite a few times and the videos played in a small box in the corner of the screen or sometimes not at all.It is hard to get into the game at first because there is no tutorial but it is worth struggling in the beginning because the game is a lot of fun when you figure it out.Overall I enjoyed the game a lot despite it's problems.

My only criticism is that it could have been more developed in terms of things like building up plantation towns, share fluctuations and opening up new areas.  The main focus of the game is making enough money to buy paintings to inherit your uncle's (meagre) fortune.  Tried playing it turn based with a guest and it worked very well for entertainment.

If only I had more friends who would get into it, I'd play this game on weekend board games nights instead if choice were prestented.

It is however strictly for the gamer who enjoys buy and sell/management games.It isn't an everyday play game, but it is an enjoyabe, about once a month maybe twice, just to play through and try a different strategys.

												   Effectively ""Colonial Exploitation"" the PC Boardgame    Gameplay is fairly straight forward.  Travel to a location where you can grown crops.  Purchase a plantation or two to grow crops, wait a week (only time this is needed re crops), ship the crops to New York or London for best prices, travel there, sell crops, rollover money into new plantations or upgrading existing ones, carry on expanding.   The money is then used to finance the repurchase of your uncle's art collection at auctions, fund expeditions to find more art, pay for training to spot forgeries - a key part of the game.  You can also drop in on your uncle to boost your status with the aim of being the most popular niece or nephew when he dies and inheriting the lot.   It's effectively a time and asset management game.  Your plantation workers only get paid when you visit.  Stay away too long and they go on strike.  The game also permits skulduggery like paying money to incite strikes at opponents' plantations.  However production costs are so low (thus ""Colonial Exploitation"" the PC game) compared to shipping and storage costs that it makes sense to boost your workers' pay to make strikes less likely and more expensive for your opponents.  I found the best strategy was to occupy as much land as I could on the Atlantic rim so I could spend time on art courses, visiting my uncle, and attending auctions (usually one per circuit) and still get back before I lost my workers.   BEWARE ! You need to print out the decoder table from the documentation folder.  If you have been on an art course you can tell whether a painting is a fake, an original, or a Vermeer - a high quality fake that will be accepted unless and until the original turns up.  If you have been on the art course you get a code which you need to check against the decoder table to indicate fake, authentic, Vermeer.   Like a number of purchasers I picked this up in a sale as part of the Patricians and Merchants pack.  At the full price of £3.99 it's overpriced in my view but heavily discounted it's casual fun for a while.  Long term playability may increase if you have humans to play against - the game is episodic enough to be workable hot seating and auctions have a different bid key for each player.   The game starts in 1917 so you get to swank around going to art galleries and bar hopping with your uncle whilst your plantation workers slave away for a $1,00 a day, and the rest of world are still fighting World War 1.  GTA V looks moral in comparison.S.x.			"

												You travel among the world to buy and manage small operations, it's more of like a simulation game broken up to a small, very small, casual arcade game for simulation? It's really weird and hard to explain.			"

												I don't know what I was thinking when I bought this game. The objective is stupid and the controls confusing. Don't make my mistake.			"

												Da ich das Spiel nicht mal starten kann ist es absolut nutzlos.Ich habe es auf eine Fat32 formatierte Partition installiert, ohne Erfolg.Ich habe jeden erdenklichenKompatibilitätsmodus ausprobiert, ohne Erfolg.Mein Betriebssystem ins Win8.1 64b, ich empfehle keinem mit gleichen Vorraussetzungen das Spiel zu kaufen. Meine Vermutung ist das es einfach nicht unter 64b läuft, es war auch niemals dafür gedacht. (Als das Spiel Programmiert wurde gabs einfach noch kein 64b....)			"

												This game changed my life. The developers really went all out. I can only describe the quality of this game as organic. I really connected with the art work. The uncle character's personality is sublime. ************/10 The best game evar. THUG FO LIFE!			"

												A surprisingly addictive little game that has an old school (386 era gaming) feel with a respectable delivery. The game plays out similar to monopoly meets Where in the World is Carmen San Diego, as you establish plantations around the world, sell your  yields in either the American or London markets while trying to put together your Uncle's lost Art Collection in an attempt to earn his favour and heathy a inheritance as a result.It has a Spy vs Spy quality in that you sabotage your sibling rivals while they sabotage you. It has various locations and crops to choose from, giving it a Monopoly-esque feel as different playing style suit different locations. Finally, it has the constant state of motion and ""one more turn"" feel that makes it a lot more interesting and engrossing than it may seem when described in words.A Gaming Gem, and a real bargain at $5 or less!

												I recommend this game. It is an interesting take on high level management in a high profit industry.You travel the globe exploiting the locals for high profits. It is not a very in-depth simulation and would be very easy to play again with even better results.I class it similar to other buy/sell games a la drug wars, etc. It seems not very random which makes it easy to understand what you need to concentrate on to make a profit.Again, recommended.

												Its very entertaining traveling around the world making money by setting up plantations and using the money you get to invest in shares and more importantly buying back the paintings you should have inherited. Also great feature in game is that you can play multiplayer in hotseat.			"
