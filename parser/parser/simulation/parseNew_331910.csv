												While I was here I thought I would write a reveiw for this game which is something I rarely do. This game is fantastic in so many ways. It is relatively easy but still poses a challenge, it has beautiful graphics (not necessarily realistic but none the less beautiful) and it is entertaining. There are things that could be inproved and full price is a bit steep for what you get but if this game is in the sale then TAKE IT because you will not be dissapointed! Thumbs Up!			"

												+Easy to jump into+Decent graphics+Employee and price management on individual buildings+Beach is divided into parts, allowing you to set individual prices for each one+Skill points which can be spent to improve various aspects of your business+The sandbox map is pretty large-No scenarios, just the sandbox map-Some mechanics (like what the circles mean around the buildings) aren't explained well-Some advisor messages could be a bit more helpful/detailed

												Ok Changing my review a little, Tip one if you buy this, Start a game and build all the small junk till your broke then click the speed arrow 3 times for fastest speed, Take a bath. When you come back you ahould have unlocked lvl 2, Restart the game with new money, All your unlocks save. Wierd game really, 4/10 so far			"
