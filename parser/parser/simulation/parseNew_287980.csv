												People are calling this game 'Calming,' or 'Zen.' Is it, really? The design is minimalist, and the audio is subdued, and you can pause whenever you want - but all that just disguises what is actually one of the most deviously clever and difficult puzzle games I've ever seen.So: Stations are little shapes on the map. People show up at each little shape, wanting to go to some other shape. You connect the shapes with metro lines, and a little train will show up to ferry people along the lines you drew to get everyone where they want to go. There's a few more mechanics, but that's 90% of it.There are only so many metro configurations you can have for any given map, but with every station that pops up, the possibilities increase in number exponentially. There's never quite enough lines or enough carriages or enough tunnels to keep all of your passengers totally satisfied. In essence, playing this game is endlessly performing triage on an ever-growing network that's a few bad decisions away from becoming an unsustainable mess and collapsing under its own weight. It's mind-warping how fast things can get out of hand if you're careless.Forget Telltale; here, every choice you make feels genuinely heavy and difficult, because they actually are heavy, difficult choices. Crucially, though, there's always a right choice that will keep you alive for at least another week. Every game ends in you frantically trying to fix a bottleneck in your network, or deperately rerouting half your lines to ease up the congestion in one distant corner of your map - and failing. But there's always something you could have done, out of the umptillion different decisions the game threw at you.This game is terrifying. I've been pulling my hair out. The quiet bleeps and bloops of the passengers arriving and leaving no longer register as something Calming or Zen but as something far more sinister. Needless to say, I absolutely love it.			"

												<Review Update> I originally reviewed this game in 2014.  Since then the game has added a number of features.  First, the game has sound and music now (they are sort of one and the same.  All sounds are music notes, and all the notes make the music.), which I think is quite good.  You get an audio cue now when things start to become frantic, as the music tempo begins to pick up.  Secondly, there are now more modes and objectives, which gives even returning players something new to accomplish.  Third, the game now has much better options, including color blind modes and automatic gif recording of your metro system.  Fourth, I can now confirm that the game works great with touchscreen systems like the Microsoft Surface.  Past these items, the core gameplay stays the same (just smoother) against my alpha review from two years ago.  I continue to recommend the game with two big thumbs up.<End Update>Mini Metro belongs to the category I call ""Optimization Games.""  These are games like Banished, Prison Architect or Sim City.  These sort of games are more about building the best thing you can with your resources available, and less about reaching a ""win"" state.Mini Metro is a extremely minimalist version of these sorts of games.  Whereas in a game like Banished you'll be trying to balance population growth, food supplies, trading resources, lumber, etc, Mini Metro just asks you to get your passengers from station A to station B.Mini Metro doesn't have saves or anything, and you can expect a single round of the game to last about 15-20 minutes.  During this time, stations of various shapes will pop up, and they'll begin to have passengers show up.  Your goal is to build your rail lines in a way that gets the people to their intended station.  Have too many passengers waiting too long to get somewhere and you lose.Where Mini Metro really succeeds is that it builds a lot of tension easily thanks to the constant need to incorporate new locations, while only giving you minimal additional resources.  Can your Red Train Line handle an extra circle station?  Maybe you can rearrange the stations a bit to fit that new station onto your Yellow Train Line instead?  You'll be juggling these decisions constantly.Overall, I highly recommend Mini Metro.  It's kept me occupied for longer than many other optimization games have.  Despite it's simplicity, there's a lot of room to improve your skills in the game, and I tend to find myself thinking of new station arrangements when I'm not playing.  That's the sign of a good game, and it's the same feeling games like XCom or Banished gave me.  If you enjoy these sorts of games, I would very much say it's worth your money, even in it's current Alpha state.			"

Early Access Review
Mini Metro is a zen-like strategy experience with pleasing minimal visuals that utilizes the real-world simulation of public transit and the growing system of subways that various corners of the world have come to know. The simple metro-line style of the game is not only a minimal aesthetic, but a symbol of civilization that is powerful to those who have relied on it for a better portion of our lives.Although simple in appearance Mini Metro is nothing short of a complex affair with lots of little mechanics to learn as you delve deeper. The game is easy enough for players of any level to hop into but offers layers upon layers of choice and consequence that you will need to learn and master through hours of your own planning of expansive transit systems. You begin by connecting differently shaped metro stations to other stations with similarly shaped passengers, which gets complicated as you notice your limit on Metro lines you're able to make and the amount of trains you're able to have carrying passengers. Without an even balance between how much load each of your lines have you'll quickly have a station overcrowd leading to a Game Over.Overcrowding can be avoided through careful planning as well as the help of upgrades you get to choose between at the end of each week. These can be very hard decisions as you'll be deciding between the ability to build another carriage to hold more of your overflowing passengers, extra bridges to allow you more tactical planning under rivers and other tracks, or a new line giving you a new color-coordinated track to work with on the constantly expanding map. Only one of these upgrades can be chosen and not using the chance efficiently will end your reign as a metro tycoon much quicker.The game is currently undergoing some extremely ambitious and promising sound work, including a soundtrack being composed by the legendary Disasterpeace. Sound is a feature I am greatly anticipating, because while the silence serves the minimalistic approach to the aesthetics of the game it could really use a bit of atmosphere. Until then I can easily throw on any appropriate Brian Eno record and bliss-out to the creation of my own Metro system, And as Eno himself wrote, ""I lose control and at last I am part of the machinery."" Mini Metro does its part well in capturing the machine driven lifestyles of the modern world and infusing it with a tactical and addictive interactive twist that anyone from casual strategy fans to serious transit geeks can get excited about.There's already a good selection of real-world maps allowing you to construct and plan anywhere from London to Hong Kong, as well as more than enough features like Leaderboards and alternative Nightmodes to play around with. Its state in Early Access is merely a sign of great things to come for an already blissful strategy game. I'm extremely excited for what's in store and can't wait for the upcoming procedural soundtrack, additional features, and very hopefully some new maps. Two cities I'd personally love to see are Tokyo and Prague (Hi Timmy!) and with enough support Mini Metro is sure to deliver on fresh content.			"

								Mini Metro is a game that allows the player to teach all those transportation moguls how to properly setup a metro grid, or how to properly fail at doing so. Odds are it will be the latter.It's an incredibly fun and challenging game, that will leave the player looking for the best possible routes.Transportation is the center of the world! It is the glue of our daily lives. When it goes well, we don't see it. When it goes wrong, it negatively colors our day, makes us feel angry and impotent, curtails our possibilities.Robin ChaseWithout any further delay, I present to you my review of Mini Metro.GameplayIf riding a metro is part of your daily routine, you'll either be extremely interested in trying Mini Metro out, or completely uninterested.The goal is to ""survive"" as many days as possible by having customers happy, which means providing them transportation without having to spend much time waiting for it. As you can easily imagine, that's pretty simple to do, but as the game goes on, not only will the map increase, more stations will also start appearing, which can, sometimes, force the player to redo all the lines.At the end of each week there will be a couple rewards, from more locomotives, to carriages, tunnels and extra lines, all of which can be used to make life easier. But choose wisely, as you may find yourself in need of either reward sooner than you think.It's up to the player to make sure they don't end up like all the metro companies in the world, full of angry customers.Pros Really good concept; Has a feel of progression looking at the map grow as the game goes on; Minimalist UI, containing everything that's needed and nothing more; Beautiful design; If you ever get eye sore from all the white background, you can also change to night mode, and vice versa; Doesn't get too repetitive, as the starting stations are randomized; Various city maps; Active development team; Price.Considering it's an Early Access (EA) game, I've decided to add a ""Neutral"" category, for details I consider important, but not gamebreakers, and could easily improve the gameplay if attended.Neutral Lack of a soundtrack/sound effects (which is already part of the developers' plan); Would be nice to see different vehicle models, even if only for each country/city.Not much to point out ""Cons"" wise, as the game is pretty solid.Cons Once you get the hang of it, it sort of becomes trivial.VerdictI'd give it a 9/10, as it offers the player a nice and relaxing experience, as well as a nice change from the current gaming trend.

												It's really easy to make a game overly complicated, so it becomes all the more delightful when you come across a simple game with a lot of depth. Every part of Mini Metro is simple and clean, from the concept to the presentation to the mechanics, but the simplicity gives way to moments of intense strategizing.Each game starts with just three stations, represented as a circle, triangle, and square. You click and drag between them to draw your subway lines, and then watch your little train zip along and pick up passengers of all shapes. Each station generates passengers for the other station shapes, so ideally you want at least one circle, triangle, and square on each line. New stations pop up as time passes, and you have to extend your lines or lay new ones to service them. Your resources are limited, however, generally only starting with three lines and three trains. At the end of every week, you get another train and a choice between two additional resources. These can be more lines, more trains, additional carriages to add to existing trains, more tunnels or bridges for crossing the map obstacles, or upgraded stations for holding more impatient passengers. The game ends if one of your stations hits capacity for too long, which can lead to some panicked re-drawing of lines and dropping of trains.Actually, it will ALWAYS lead to panic because Mini Metro is insidious in how the scenarios ramp up. Stations pop up in unequal groupings, and unique stations like stars and pentagons can appear in the most awkward places. From your three starting stations the map will explode into a nightmare network of wrong stations in just the wrong spots, forcing re-draws and overhauls of your entire service just to reach that one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ station that opened up across the river in the southwest corner. But this explosion will happen so gradually, and accompanied by soothing ambient music and pleasant jingles of services running smoothly, that you almost won't notice until its too late. Like with any good puzzle game there's pressure to perform here, but it's presented in such a way that it causes none of that uncomfortable anxiety that trying to form a clutch tetris or landing that last bubble in Puzzle Bobble does. It's a fun challenge through and through, one that never gets old or tiring.There are eleven different maps to play on right now, with each having a different layout of obstacles, different layouts of stations, and different capacities for stations. Paris and New York play very differently, for example, with Paris having a lot of tightly-clustered stations with low capacities, while New York has them spread far and wide across the boroughs. The game also has daily challenges to compete in, with everyone taking a shot at the same map and station growth patterns. There are two additional difficulties as well if you get tired of the normal game; there's a sandbox mode if you just want to draw pretty lines and work on efficiency, and an extreme mode where you cannot redraw existing lines, which makes me sweat just thinking about. If you're into achievements, they've got some good ones to keep you playing. Each city has a basic competency achievement, and then one that requires a specific challenge condition, like moving 1200 people around London using only one tunnel. If you enjoy the basic puzzling offered here, there's dozens of hours of it to be had.I like puzzle games well enough, but few have sucked me in like Mini Metro. The genius presentation using the clean subway map style makes it easy and inviting to work with. And while it certainly doesn't have the complexity of something like Transport Tycoon or Cities in Motion, I find it scratching the same itch in how well it abstracts the subway systems for each city. For fans of puzzle games this one is a no-brainer, and even if you're looking for something more on the management side, there's something to be said for Mini Metro.			"

												Mini Metro is a simplistic strategy game where you must design train lines connecting different parts of one of many major cities. You begin with three lines, three trains and some tunnels (number of tunnels depends on the city) and each week you unlock a new train to use as well as one of two other things such as a new line, more tunnels and carriages to attach to your existing trains. As time goes by new stations will open and you'll need to connect them to existing lines or create entirely new lines, managing your lines effectively is key as the game ends when a station is overcrowded for too long.+Simple but fitting art style, it looks just like London Underground maps and I can't think of anything that would suit this game better+The controls are nice and simple, all you have to do is drag your mouse from one station to the next in order to connect them+Already quite a few different cities to try out+It's incredibly relaxing to play+If the default game is too bright for you (if you have sensitive eyes like myself you may find this) then you can turn on Night Time mode which makes everything considerably darker +The UI is very basic and stays out of your way most of the time which really adds to the feeling that you're looking at a real map+There's a number of different types/shapes of stations, having to connect one of each type to each line to move passengers effectively adds a nice level of challenge to the game+As well as the normal gamemode which I briefly explained earlier there is also an endless mode where station overcrowding does not end the game and your only goal is to make your city as effecient as possible+Station positions are different every time you play+As is expected of such a game you can fast forward time as well as pause (pausing is very handy if you want to completely redesign all of your lines)+/-Sound has now been added to the game but personally I think it's a little too basic, there aren't any sound effects for the trains themselves, just your actions, e.g. connecting up two stations.Verdict:Essential PurchaseA simplistic strategy game that has a great concept, a fitting art style, simple controls, simple gameplay and is ever so relaxing to play. If you're looking for a simple strategy game to play or you're a regular user of the trains in one of the playable cities then you really need this game.No drama, Just Reviews?El K.			"

												The premise of this game had me intrigued as I am curious about how metro systems around the world are designed. I though that I was getting a sim-style game that would let me lay out a metro system in meticulous detail, but this isn't the game that I was looking for. I do enjoy the game, but it is a real-time puzzle game, and not a sim.There are many cities that you can play in, and each starts with three stations of different shapes - a Circle, Square, and Triangle. A station's shape determines the destination of/number of passengers that will spawn there. For example, Circles will spawn the most riders, but few passengers from other stations will want to go there. A station spawns riders in the shape of the station that they wish to go to, and each passenger boards trains that can take them to one of their destination type, and not a specific station. Your score is the number of total passengers delivered to their destination.Stations spawn periodically and connecting lines to them so that passengers will get picked up in a timely manner before the stations get overcrowded is the goal of the game. In addition to the three main shapes, several unique shapes can spawn as well, which ups the difficulty quite a bit. Passengers choose trains intelligently, so not always by the shortest route, but the one that will likely take the least amount of time.Each ""week"" you get a new train and another random reward that could be a carriage (more passengers for a train), tunnels (the number varies), a new line (there is a maximum number of lines on each map, and you always start with three), or an interchange (increases the number of passengers a stop can handle before overcrowding).You get visual and audible warnings when a station start to get overcrowded, and if the problem isn't resolved in about 45 seconds, the game ends. So planning ahead is vital, but you can't always do that due to the random nature of the station spawns. Sometimes you'll have a nice mix of stations along each line, and can get quite an impressive score. Other times you'll have eight Circle stations isolated from everything else and only one or two lines to service them, which is usually not enough.Games last anywhere from a few minutes to 30, and scores range from 200 to 2000+, depending on the map and the luck of the spawns. I recommend the game, but it can be frustrating when you have a good game going and three or four Circle stations spawn in inconvenient spots and ruin it. Still, it's great for when you have 10-20 minutes and not too taxing on the brain.			"

								When you take a first look at Mini Metro it all looks incredibly easy and simple. But underneath this deceivingly simple exterior lies a deep and complex, although minimalist, puzzle/simulation game where you’re given the task of moving as many people as you can between huge amounts of subway stations.You start off by connecting a couple of shapes together and each separate line you create next will have a different color. There are 3 colors when you begin; blue, red and yellow. So it’s not unlimited, you only have limited resources. More colors can be unlocked weekly at random.The more you play the more stations will eventually randomly pop up. At the beginning you can manage things relatively easily, but when you’re trying to connect your tenth station or so, things can become (more) hectic. It’s your job to create and manage the lines as efficient as possible; if too many people are waiting for a train a circle will start to fill up and once it’s filled up it is game over. Should you get there in time and at the same time take a couple of passengers with you then this meter will decrease again.Thankfully, at the end of the week you’ll earn a random award. This can be a tunnel (for crossing water) or an extra train, carriage or rails (i.e. extra color) and you can remove some of the current workload by using these items strategically.And despite all these hectic situations Mini Metro can still feel sort of relaxing. The reason for that is probably because it looks so simple and is intuitive to control. You just grab a line and drag it to the station and if there are no conflicts (like missing bridges or weird (intersecting) lines) the game will automatically readjust the rails for you. Easy as pie !This Early Access edition is missing a couple of things that will be available in the final version of the game. The music is the most important thing that’s missing and it’s something that I sorely missed. It feels weird having no sounds at all while playing. Still, you can always play your own music on the background. And it’s really not that big of a deal anyway; I’m sure once the music is fully integrated it will be just lovely and make the game that much better. It’s just a matter of time. And just check out the trailer, it gives a taste of what’s to come. Exciting stuff !Some extra modes still have to be added as well. But the default mode is there (and still being worked on) for those that want to set a high score.I don’t think the game really needs a tutorial but a simple explanation would be appreciated and I think it’s a smart idea to add it anyway. You’ll get the hang of the game soon enough, but it might seem daunting at first. It requires a bit of trial and error but it’s certainly more satisfying if you set a good score later on, knowing that you did it all by yourself.And it would be nice to see a better alert if a station gets added. Later in the game when things are too hectic and you’re too focused you won’t always notice that one or more stations are still unconnected. It’s just a minor flaw/complaint and I hope there’s a way to improve this, if only for a tiny bit because the alert is definitely noticeable as long as you pay enough attention to your surroundings.Mini Metro is an excellent game and a mighty fun one. If you like simulation (not just the ones that are too realistic) and puzzle games then you practically can’t go wrong with this game. And for this price it’s an absolute steal. Highly recommended ! [Rating: 82/100]			"

								So I discovered Mini-Metro about a few months ago, and was following its progress since. I finally got around to purchasing it for myself, and in short, I haven't stopped playing! I never knew a game in such early stages and unfinished could provide sooo much fun and amusement.Now on to a proper review: Pro's: > Simplistic, didn't have to overdo the features to get enjoyment> Smooth Look: Not made poorly, very good aesthetics> Non-Repeatitive: Always a different layout on every restart of a map> Consistant New Features: The devs are actively adding / fixing stuff all the time> Has a Night Mode, changes White to Black, much easier on the eyes! Con's: > No Sound: Atleast, not yet, I know its being worked on as the next feature> Waiting Passengers sometimes are confusing as to where they want to go> Trains sometimes skip stationsWell thats all I can think of for now. I am still enjoying the life out of Mini-Metro and am eagerly awaiting what the devs come up with next!(wink wink nudge nudge: maybe some more maps to play on @devs? eh? hehe)My overall rating: 9/10. Highly recommend the game, has a few minor issues, but thats expected in a Beta game. But hey, go grab a copy and play, you won't regret it!			"

Mini Metro is a small strategy game about making a subway map for growing city.Normal mode: You start with 3 lines and 3 trains (Blue, Red and Yellow) you must connect at least 1 line with all 3   figures (Not counting rare ones) Every week you can choose what you want to have (Train,line,tunnels etc) so it will help you later. The aim is to don't let a lot people wait near the figures, if there will be too many ""people"" you lose the game and you can continue in Endless mode.Endless mode: Is almost the same, but you decide when you lose (By quiting the game) because is Endless!PROS+ RelaxingAfter hard work when you are finally at home, you can relax with Mini Metro, game is going slowly and is always fun+ RandomMaps are the same but figures spawn randomly+ GraphicsColours are amazing!

												Mini Metro is an extremely polished, well made game by Dinosaur Polo Club (which is an amazing name, btw).The premise is that you are designing the layout of a subway/train system to get people where they want.  Instead of cluttering the gameplay with stats and names, everything is abstracted and simplified for a very smooth experience.I have 87 hours on record on steam, and many more on their alpha version they had on their website previously.You start on a map with 3 stations: A Square, a Triangle, and a Circle.  At each station, passengers will appear and your job is to connect these stations so they can get to where they want.  When a passenger appears, he will appear as a symbol, for example, a square.  And the goal is to bring them to a station that matches their own symbols.The trains themselves are smart, and will only pick up passengers that can be dropped off down the line OR allow them to switch lines at an interchange to get where they want.As the game progresses, the map zooms out so and new stations are added.  You will face increasing difficulty in the presence of unique symbols (which reinforces the need for efficient interchanges), as well as GLUT OF CIRCLES that is the doom of all system designers (once you play it, you will see what I mean).Different game modes exist depending on your tastes: Normal - The standard game where you can adjust/move your tracks at willEndless - Relaxed gamemode where you can play as long as you want with no loss conditionExtreme - Tracks are permanent, so future planning is important!They also have a Daily Challenge mode where you get to play the exact same layout as everyone else, so you can measure exactly how you stack up to other people.Everything has Leaderboards, of course, so you can marvel at how some people can achieve the results they managed.Non-Gameplay elements are also polished, pleasant music, smooth/clean UI, are all very appreciated.

												Every so often you'll come across a game that simply clicks. There might be nothing mind-blowing about it, but it will be simple, clean, and, most of all, entertaining. Mini Metro is one such game to me. It bills itself as a ""simulation"" game, setting you the task of building up and managing a train network, but it's not really. Mini Metro is more similar to a casual time management experience, where you have to use limited resources (in terms of train lines and carriages) to juggle the rapidly expanding network, and the increased number of passengers that the network brings. Leave too many passengers waiting on one platform too long and it's game over.Style isn’t something you would typically associate with a train simulation game, but that’s more of less what we have with Mini Metro. It’s easily the sleekest and most visually pleasing rail-themed game I’ve ever played. Modelling itself on classic underground rail systems from around the world (with maps to match) you connect shapes to ensure passengers reach their destinations. It’s a simple premise elevated by perfect execution.Stations are symbolised on the map as ""shapes"" (star, triangle, circle, square, etc), and each passenger has a desire to get to a specific station in order to complete their trip. If they're on a station with a line that takes them directly to their desired station, then it's all good. However, if they're on a station that doesn't take them directly to their goal, they'll travel to a connection station so they can swap lines and get to where they want to go. It's a good idea to try and get as many lines to go to as many different stations as possible, otherwise your network fills with passengers changing trains and not getting to where they need to efficiently. But on the other hand, if a single train line is too long, then trains take too long to travel it, and that in turn means that people build up on the platforms.So the goal is to balance these conflicting challenges in such a way that the train network covers as much as possible as efficiently as possible. It's not as easy as it sounds. Train tracks can't cross, meaning you need to make good use of the train stations to divert track lines. There's also a very limited number of tunnels or bridges, meaning that only a couple of track lines can pass any river or body of water. And you're limited in how many carriages you can have on the tracks, meaning you need to carefully plan for where the heaviest congestion will be.Impressively, there are a wide number of cities to play on, and each one has a very different feel to it. Japan's Osaka, for example, gives you access to a limited few shinkansen ""bullet trains"" which need to be carefully placed to account for the longer distance that it takes to get to some stations. Australia's Melbourne, meanwhile, has you building a tram network, which means trains move more slowly, and you'll need to account for that. China's Hong Kong builds up incredibly quickly, meaning you'll need to think much more quickly on your feet. In addition to the very different mechanics and environment that mark each city, there's also online leaderboards, daily challenges, and an extreme difficulty mode for extra replay value. There's even the ability to export your efforts to a .gif image format, which allows you to share your efforts online, and show friends how you were able to build up your network.As abstract as this all is - meaning you don't need to manage finances, positioning of stations, and so on - the end result is that you end up with a train network that does indeed look like real-world train networks. This is reinforced by the aesthetics, which are truly gorgeous in their minimalism. I love the look of train network maps - I actually have a framed map of Tokyo's network hanging on a wall. As such, I love the look of Mini Metro, and how quickly the network of tracks builds up.Mini Metro is a fine puzzle strategy game that has just the right balance of a quick turnaround of gameplay to maintain attention and enough depth of gameplay, gradually scaling as you play, to keep things interesting. The demands of your various stations are modest and managing the flow of traffic is basic enough. But then, as midnight on Sunday rolls around, you have to choose your tools for expanding and responding to new challenges in the coming week.There's actually not that much more to the game; as I mentioned, it's really quite simple in execution. But it is tightly balanced, elegant, and nearly perfect in execution. I think this game should be on iPad, 3DS or Vita, as I do believe it's the perfect way to get through a real train trip, but regardless, it is a brilliant example of minimalist design.			"

								Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!“Mini Metro” (not to be confused with the popular “Metro” series mod that turns protagonist Artyom into Tyrion Lannister) is the latest in a long line of ingenious, unique puzzlers to come out in 2014. Why then, you might ask, would “Mini Metro” be worth your time and money? How, you might muse, does “Mini Metro” stand out from the rest of the pack? Well I'll tell you why and how if you would just stop posing these hypothetical questions.“Mini Metro” is a metro designing simulator, putting you in the shoes of the world's most unfortunate subway planner. You're just sitting in your cramped office when word comes down from the top that you have to connect stations, plan lines, tunnels, and bridges, and deal with overcrowding. On the fly. By the seat of your pants. OH, and like all things in life, it is a pointless struggle. Eventually the city will be overwhelmed, the denizens of the metro spilling out into the street when the system can no longer handle it, consuming the weak, tired, and old, and converting the strong into public transit enthusiasts. At least that's what I tell myself the fail state is.But you will fail, eventually. The key is to juggle your increasing geometric crowds, linking corresponding triangles and circles to their stations, cutting corners and making gaps to accommodate the load. And when you're finally defeated you'll get a final score denoting the days you lasted and your busiest numbers. It's very rewarding and, at least  initially, somewhat relaxing.Right now there are a number of cities to choose from and one mode, classic, to test your skills. As this is EARLY ACCESS there are some features missing, namely two upcoming modes, zen and EXTREME, and a soundtrack. I recommend putting this in window mode and blasting your favorite music for the time being.This is a fun, chill puzzler. No bells and whistles, no gimmick. Just a sleek, minimalistic take on being a municipal planner who's getting too old for this♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

								EDIT: Since I wrote this review, Mini Metro added a lot of settings (including audio!!!), a ""Daily Challenge Mode"", and a lot of other neat things! My recommendation still stands, just beware that some of the information is a bit dated.When I first got Mini Metro, I assumed it'd be similar to games like Train Simulator, or SimCity. And it is, to a certain extent. But it also isn't. Mini Metro is packed with a very minimal design, a beautiful colour scheme, and a very intuitive interface. It just looks... smooth. It opts for a very clean, non-distractive interface, which is welcoming for a casual game to play.The gameplay is stellar. While it doesn't reach levels of complexity that Train Simulator will have, it emulates a very tough, decision making game, while still keeping its casual feel. You plan out the metro system for a variety of cities, with each city having its own characteristics (for example, Osaka features the Shinkansen, or the Bullet Train). You struggle to make sure none of your stations overflow, and at the same time make sure that everybody gets where they want to. You are restricted in the amount of trains, lines, and tunnels you have, creating a level of depth most casual games don't hold.My only critique of the game is the lack of information and music/audio, but it's Early Access! For what it is, especially its price, Mini Metro is one of the best Early Access games I've come across. I've bought the game to support the developer, and watch the game evolve, and boy, sure it has. Updates are pushed regularily, and bugs are fixed.Mini Metro is one of those games that looks simple on the surface, but has layers of complexity, while keeping its casual style. I would recommend it to anybody who wants a game to sink 20 minutes in, and have fun while using their brain!			"

												Have you ever played a game and thought,""gee, why didn't I think of that?"" well Mini Metro is that game for me. It's so simple and elegant in it's design yet at the same time incredibly complex in it's strategy. The general gist is to get passengers from point A to B in the most efficient way possible using the resources available to you of course.To add an extra level of depth we're given real world locations as stages. If you ever felt like the guys who made NYC's MTA were stupid here's your chance to do better. At first you might think it's easy enough. Go to where you're needed most. But as your city's population grows so does the need for more trains and more stops. And locations can grow quite quickly.Mini Metro has two modes for your transpo sim pleasure. The first is normal where you are free to move and adjust lines at your convenience, already quite challenging. The second is extreme, which gives you the real world constraint of lines being permanent. Every time you reach a milestone you're rewarded with 2 tools to aid your construction. Eventually you'll reach overcrowding  at a station and that's pretty much game over but then a lovely option presents itself. You can now continue building your subway system for efficiency and play till your heart's content. The graphics are very simple. Basically shapes and lines. Usually there's also a river or two, designed after whichever city you're playing in. There's a bit of a learning curve later in the game where you're introduced to a few new elements. There are also options for colorblindness and a dark mode if you're like me and rather not be starting at a blinding white screen the entire time. There's also daily challenges and leaderboards if you like comparing your work with other's.My only gripe is with the music. I love me some Diasasterpeace  as  much as the next person but the tempo increases as your subway system grows. Which means the music can get as chaotic as your level and that leads to a bit of an annoyance sound wise. I wish there was an option for keeping the mellow beginner music throughout your game. It gets harder to focus with the hectic sounds or maybe that's the point. Mute is always an option. Despite that one gripe  this is one of the best if not the best train simulation puzzle game I've played this year. Nay, I'd say this might be the best train sim game ever.			"

								I remember discovering, and enjoying, this game back when it was a free alpha release. Now it is in a (more stable) beta form, even at this stage, I still consider DPC's efforts to be more than exceptional thus far. The gameplay is simplistic and easy to pick up, but difficult to master - and that is by virtue. I think this game has the most perfect difficulty curve of anything I have played - the start is pretty simple, however, over time, the game becomes a race between land-usage (represented by the different station icons) and line-deployment.I will give this game a pass on a few things because of its beta state, so here are the pros and cons:GOOD:+ Great, simple graphics (will run on anything that can display a screen. And yes, 4K 60 FPS, okay guys?).+ Easy-to-understand gameplay.+ Addictive gameplay+ Gentle difficulty curve+ Fun-strating (FUN + FRUSTRATING! Or fun + menstrating, take your pick)+ Great location design+ Touchscreen support (it works better with a touchscreen than a mouse!)BAD:- Efficiency stage (items given per # of passengers as opposed to weekly) can get boring once you reach ""peak"" performance- Menus do not use keyboard keys except EnterOverlooking because beta;? No sound (will be introduced later, but can be plus if you like the quiet environment while playing this game)? Menus a bit glitchyOverall: 9/10, waiting eagerly to see finished product.			"

												Visiting family over Christmas, and I wanted to play a game. It had to be cheap, since I was buying through someone elses account, and it had to be something you could pick up and play for a bit and not be concerned with leaving behind any unfinished saves or whatever. My family enjoy puzzle games too, so it was the first thing to look for.I stumbled across this and it seemed to tick all of the above boxes; so with low expectations due to the price, I gave it a download.What I've found is a brilliantly simple tower defence type puzzler which upon loading offes you a plain white screen with three different shapes on it. These are in fact underground stations that will accept that 'shape' of passenger. A graphical tutorial shows you that you have to draw a (railway) line between the shapes, and once done, a small train begins ferrying the shapes from their point of origin to the nearest station of the correct shape; changing lines where they cross in a station if needs be.As time ticks by, more stations appear along with more passengers; your task is to keep the system running without any single station becoming overwhelmed - and each game week you can choose an upgrade; an extra carriage for a train, the ability to draw a whole new line, the ability to tunnel under water, and sometimes an interchange (a higher capacity station).Brilliantly simple in execution and with a calming appearance and soundtrack, this is one of those 'one more go' type games which is easy to play but incredibly difficult to master.Highly recommended for a 'pick up and play' game when you have a few spare minutes; this would be an ideal tablet game but until then - it works with a big screen and mouse just as well.

								Positives:Though still in need of some refinement and balancing—and possibly some additional features—the core gameplay of Mini Metro scratches that city-building itch without requiring a major investment of time. You can play this on a break without worrying you'll be sucked in for hours (though you won't get bored if you did waste a day on it).The interface is a case study in complex, context-sensitive functionality from simple interactions. Click, hover, drag and drag paths all combine to do just what you want without requiring a tutorial. Though you might spend your first game puzzling it out, it all just works how you'd expect on the first or second try. Pure, blissful affordance. If only more games thought out their interface so elegantly.Negatives:There is a well-known ""cheat"" that isn't really a cheat (it's inherent in the game rules) but that renders the leaderboards meaningless. The devs are still struggling with this issue, and I think it's resolution must lie in clarifying the game's biggest ambiguity: am I running a simulation of a real subway network (in which case, shouldn't it cost me something to re-route lines) or am I stress-testing a subway plan by iterative design under increasing load (in which case, shouldn't I have some prior information about where additional stations will appear). This ambiguity is at the heart of the game's ultimate success or failure, and the devs need to do more than apply band-aid solutions and ad hoc rule tweaks. I feel like the solution is to split the game into entirely different game modes which rest on different existential assumptions about what the game really is.A little more information and clarity, compactly presented, would reduce some of the minor frustrations and provide greater insight into the network you've built. How many trains do I have on a given subway line? Can I see some meaningful data on throughput or efficiency? I have trouble believing the devs haven't read any of Edward Tufte's masterful works on data presentation. They'd do well to revisit his books for ideas.[REVISED] The passenger AI is improving. Rather than being deterministically stubborn, passengers have acquired a variability that sometimes even includes whimsical train hopping in the wrong direction and then back again. This is an improvement. There's often more than one way from A to B, not to mention that sometimes B2 or B3 offer variety. It's slightly mad, but it's better than robots.Some other minor complaints:- why am I limited to 4 trains per line? Couldn't that limit be a function of the line's length and/or the number of stations?- why can't a line go around a river bend rather than cutting the corner and requiring a tunnel?- why no save feature? sometimes I'm having a very successful game, but I have to get back to work, or join friends in another gameTL;DR:Enjoyable game. Can be played casually or obsessively. Brilliant with the potential to be an all-time classic. Well worth full price. It would be criminal to wait for a sale price.			"

								Mini Metro is an elegant subway management game from developer Dinosaur Polo Club. Game play, a matter of laying out subway routes in a growing metropolis, takes only minutes to grasp. Yet the emergent complexity of your task leads to hours of enjoyable and quite challenging play. The genre of Mini Metro is hard to say. I’ve heard it called both a sim and a puzzle game. The truth is it has elements of both (as well as a feature or two I associate with arcade games): you are given a map of an urban area composed of stops your train lines must connect. Your job is to choose the routes for the lines as well as which lines to upgrade with extra train cars and which stops to build interchanges at. As you play more stops are added, putting a greater strain on your system. The game ends when one of your stations remains over-crowded for too long, crashing your system. For every week you successfully keep the transit grid running smoothly you’re rewarded with a few more resources: some extra tunnels, a new subway line, etc.. (Worth noting is that passengers are simulated individually. They are represented as shapes corresponding with the stations they want to arrive at. Thus it is easy to tell at a glance where things are going wrong. Unlike, say, Sim City, where an esoteric formula determines where businesses will flourish, the mechanics of MiniMetro’s simulation are overtly visible. I find this pleasing.)All this sounds typical of a sim. But while Mini Metro definitely is about simulating the movements of passengers on a subway system, it stylized so as to focus solely on a design puzzle not on a recreation of reality in all its minutia. Money, scheduling, and staff are not part of the game at all. Construction is instantaneous. And if you choose to tear out a line and completely reroute it this can be done at any time at no penalty. Your task is simply to figure out how to lay out the pieces you’ve been given to deal with the ever increasing load.This stylization shines in one of Mini Metro’s best features—its minimalist graphics. The entire game looks like one of those iconic London tube maps (originally designed by electrical draughtsman Harry Beck—hence the circuit-like abstracted clarity). Your “city” is composed of a general layout of bodies of water and brightly colored tube lines connecting geometric nodes. So confident are the creators of the resulting visual charm that screen capture is built into the game. The confidence is warranted.Still in Beta at the moment, Mini Metro does have some rough edges. The most prominent is the complete absence of sound. (The developers assure that audio will be implemented any day.) More irksome is clumsiness in the interface. Rerouting lines where you’d like them is sometimes rather more difficult than the click and drag interface seems to warrant. Also, lines occasionally fail to properly bend to avoid water when it seems they should.  But none of this was a significant obstacle to my enjoyment—especially as a pause button at least allowed me the time to do the needed fiddling. I still hope these wrinkles get ironed out, though.Gameplay is fundamentally open ended. There is no point at which you’ve “solved” a city, rather you simply keep building until your system collapses. Nor is there any question of memorizing a working strategy for a given city: the stops one begins with, and the order in which they are subsequently added is randomized so that no two playthroughs are the same. This is where play felt arcade-like: even though your task is more typical of a sim or puzzler, your ultimate aim ends up being to beat your previous score, that is, to transport more Londoners (or Tokyoans, New Yorkers, etc.)  than you managed to last time. It’s addicting. It’s difficult not to respond to a loss with the though “I can do better” and begin again.To sum up, Mini Metro isn’t quite finished, but it’s already a really solid choice for people who want to grapple with a difficult design problem in a very attractive package. [Disclosure: I received a review copy of MM from the developer.]			"

												When I first encountered Mini Metro it was via watching someone else play it. My first thoughts were “That looks really boring. Why so many lines? I don’t even like trains!” And that was that. Fast forward to present day, I was asked to review this title and at first was worried. What could I possible get out of such a simplistic game? What I got was a fun and challenging experience that reminded me to not judge a book by its cover. What this title lacks in flash and flair it makes up for with a solid and enjoyable gaming experience. While this might not be everyone’s cup of tea, if you enjoy a casual time with some challenge then definitely consider this game.When you start things up you’re dumped right into the action. I’m not sure if there is a tutorial, I don’t think so, I had to learn via trial and error. While it was easy to pick up I would have liked there to be a tutorial or some sort of help feature just in case it’s needed. The game has no story, your goal is to create a functioning train system in the city of your choosing, there are eleven real world cities maps to play on. Each station is represented by a shape on the map, it can be a square, circle, diamond among other shapes. Passengers pop up at the stations wanting to get to another station and you have to connect the shapes with lines. Your train line can be short or long, straight but usually twisting. Each level you start with a limited amount of resources, usually always three lines; the amount of bridges and/or tunnels varies. As you connect more stations to each other you can make more passengers happy and hit milestones where you get more resources like extra lines, carriages to attach to a train to hold more people and other goodies. The challenge is that these are limited and the levels get more difficult and harder to manage the longer you play.It’s the aforementioned rise in difficulty which makes this game fun. What starts off as simple and relaxing can turn into a disaster if you haven’t laid your tracks correctly leaving you in a panic to try and fix your lines to handle the influx of passengers. The way the cities grow is random so each time you play things will be different and you have to adjust accordingly. However, for the most part things started collapsing around 1000 passengers because of limited resources. There is also little variety in what resources are available and even with random city growth most levels tend to be a lot of the same thing since the basic strategy to the game is the same. The game does have three modes; normal, endless and extreme, which I don’t dare try. There are also daily challenges to participate in but for the most part you keep playing to try and beat your own score and try new layouts for your lines.The graphics are very simple, however they are clean and easy to look at. There is nothing fancy going on here, the maps are based off of real world cities but even then they are still only bare bones in appearance. The stations are simple shapes and the different lines come in a variety of colors, each city has their own palette that mimics real world train line colors. The game offers a colorblind mode and a night mode, while I haven’t used these I am impressed that the developers added these features. The music in the game isn’t outstanding, but is soothing and fits well with the pacing of the game, there are also sound effects. The beeps of crowded train stations can be very useful if you become distracted elsewhere on the map.Mini Metro is a great title to play casually for short bursts at a time, or even relax with endless mode. The game has Steam trading cards as well as achievements that offer a bit of challenge, some are easy to obtain while others require certain criteria be met that a player wouldn’t normally do in a level. The game can become very repetitive, however, and I personally wouldn’t mind more content or complexity. The price is decent but again, could offer more for the ten dollar price tag. Overall I recommend this title, it’s simple and fun and sometimes that’s all a game needs to be.My RatingMust buy.A good game to buy.Only buy if on sale.Mediocre.Avoid at all costs.This review was submitted for Review Experts, check us out for more reviews.

Early Access Review
								Mini Metro, currently available in Early Access (the game can be purchased but is still in development so some elements, such as sound in this case, are missing or unfinished), is a game about moving people. Where this may seem like an oversimplification, it is not, and the game is all the better for it.   Other games of this sort focus on such elements as budget and specific regions, population density and specific destinations of interest to that population; but Mini Metro instead focuses on the general and the deliberately vague; and this works fantastically given the style of the game. There is no budget with which to be concerned, there are no apparent city divisions or districts. The placement of stations is random, and also out of the control of the player. In many ways, this almost makes the goal more true to life of a real world occupation, albeit without feeling like work: somebody is presenting the player with a scenario, and the goal is to make it work by connecting the stations, and keeping people moving.The player begins the game by selecting one of three game types, and then the city that the player would like to play. These cities are mostly without features, save for waterways. The player looks upon either an off white void or sort-of-charcoal, if night-mode is turned on, with three subway stations to connect. Speaking primarily of the Commuter game mode (the one most likely to be played) the goal is to connect these stations in as efficient a manner as possible by drawing lines to connect them using the limited number of lines, cars and carriages that have been provided. With the initial three stations this is a simple task. More stations are added as the game progresses, which serves to complicate matters. Where the player may have easily begun using only a single line to connect all of the stations, this method will lead to disaster if it is maintained. The player will have to add new lines, new cars, add on carriages to those cars to ensure that no station overfills; and all of these are in limited supply. At the end of each week the player is granted an additional car, and then the choice between one other addition: tunnels, which are required to traverse through waterways, carriages, which extend the length of a train, lines, which adds a coloured line with which to connect stations, and interchanges, which increase capacity and speedily load and unload passengers.  Only two of these additions are presented as options. The stations are randomly placed with each play through, as are the choices of additions, so memorization will not help the player. A set of options are presented, and the player has to make that work. The stations themselves are without names, and are instead represented by shapes. Most commonly, these shapes are squares, triangles and circles, and occasionally 'other' shapes will appear that one could regard as special stations. The idea is that a ""person"" who boards at a circle station will never wish to travel to another circle shaped station. These individuals are also represented by shapes: a circle shaped passenger wishes to travel to a circle shaped station, a triangle passenger wishes to travel to a triangle station, and so forth. Therein lies the strategy: a line consisting of nothing but circle stations will lead to disaster as no passenger will wish to travel from one station to another. The player must try to connect as many differently shaped stations as possible. There WILL be some overlap and stations of the same shape connecting to one another; but the goal is to minimize those occurrences to maintain efficient routes and prevent overflow.The game begins in a very calm fashion. Simply draw lines, add lines, extend lines, watch the trains pick up and deliver their passengers. It is that way for a while: calm. It does not take particularly long for that to change. All players will reach a point where chaos starts to creep in. Maybe entire lines, previously perfectly placed, are no longer efficient and have to be removed and rebuilt.  As the player cannot control where new stations are placed, and what form those stations will be, new stations may spawn close to lines that already have a pair of stations that are the same shape on either side of the new addition; and that reduces the efficiency of the line.  The alternative is to extend one of the other lines out to this new addition; but the player cannot cross the lines except by meeting them up at existing stations, which will make that extension even longer in the event that it does need to cross a line to access the new station.  While such choices represent a challenge, that challenge never feels to me to be particularly stressful.  The presentation of the game simply does not allow it.  The end result could be orderly, almost a work of art where transit maps are concerned; or it could look like a scattered mess of random connections; but so long as the stations never reach capacity then presentation hardly matters to the game. It may matter to the player, mind you. During one play through I had a well functioning three-lined transit system that crossed at odd intervals and zigzagged to and fro. It worked, and I hated it. It just didn't look proper. I had nobody to blame but myself: I COULD find another way for the system to work, but I had not looked for one.The visual presentation is minimalistic. This is a good thing. Its appearance is that of a subway/metro map. The blank background populated only by single, thick lines that represent the metro rails that the player is placing and moving about serve well to illustrate the real transit maps that are out there in the world. The player is, in essence, painting the metro maps that one would see at subway stations. It is perfect, and immediately familiar to anybody who has found themselves staring at a map, plotting their subway route and transfers to progress from point A to point B. That said, those who have never ridden a subway, or are simply unfamiliar with subway/metro transit maps may be at a loss as to why this game's visuals are as they are, and it may look to such individuals as little more than lines on an empty space without knowing or appreciating the context as to why that look may be fitting. This is a fault of nobody, only the result of individual experiences.Audio. There is none. There WILL be some; but at this stage of development it has not yet been implemented. If that's a turn off for you, then back away. Otherwise just fire up some music or background noise that you feel is appropriate, and enjoy the completed music and sound effects once they are added in.Lack of audio aside, everything, for me, just felt right. The challenge is perfect, the visual style is appealing and fitting to the context of the gameplay, and the package as a whole has a polish to it, both because of and in spite of its minimalism. It is a game as casual as the player wants it to be with its difficulty settings, and as challenging as they can handle until the end finally comes as one station finally reaches over-capacity. I recommend it to anybody who is looking for something with few rules to remember, that is satisfying, and well put together.			"

Early Access Review
								Please mind the gap. Between the train and the platform. Mind the gap, please.This is an awesome game - awesome idea and awesome execution. It may be listed as early access but is absolutely worth the asking price. Each game starts you off with three stations: A square (train station), a triangle (commercial) and a circle (residential). Each station spawns passengers which want to go to one of the three station types. As the city expands, new stations open up, mostly of triangle and circle types, but as hospitals, tourist attractions, airports and banks open around the city, unique stations open along with these attractions. This makes it more difficult to keep the metro working, but in a very nice difficulty curve. Each in-game week you keep the Metro running, you receive a locomotive and can spend your weekly budget on something new: A new line, a carriage, rezoning, a larger station, etc. These upgrades are meant to help you survive the next week. Well - eventually a station will overcrowd and you will not be able to  clear it. Your score is the number of passengers you delivered to their destination. If you however prefer to play this as a send box, there is a mode for you too. In this game mode, stations don't overcrowd and there is no lose condition. You simply play to have fun and be as efficient as possible. Overall a very good and very fun game. It is well polished and well paced and balanced. Please mind the gap. Between the train and the platform. Mind the gap, please.			"

												Mini Metro is a little game with minimal art where you create your own metro maps according to the needs of your city and people.Each station is represented by a geometrical symbol (you start with a cube, circle, and triangle at three random spots, relatively close to each other), and at the stations people will appear as smaller copies of those geometrical symbols, which indicates to which kind of station they want to travel. By connecting the stations with your rails, you create ways for your people to travel to their wanted stations. As time goes by, more stations will appear, usually more cubes, circles, and triangles, and it doesn't matter to which station your people travel as long as it is the right shape.You have a limited amount of train lines, bridges/tunnels, and trains/wagons. Each end of the week, you will get a choice between two additional supplies, to help you out. Choose wisely as it can make a difference between surviving the game or ending early. Luckily you can constantly change how you arrange your supplies.Later on more and more unique stations will appear in shapes of stars, ovals, crosses, etc... and you will only ever get one of each. This is where it gets tough, as travellers to those stations can crowd your trains fast. They will also start appearing more and more in harder to reach places (across water, etc...), and the stations will get people wanting to travel faster as well. The game ends when a station has too many people waiting to get on trains.The gameplay is pretty solid, the music is very relaxing, and on endless mode the game can be just what you need to have a quiet time. Each city has its own unique achievement that makes the gameplay a little different for each map, which otherwise would make each city just too similar. It makes replaying the game not a chore.			"

ESPRESSO SHOT REVIEWMini Metro is a wonderfully addictive game that involves strategy and quick planning to run a metro transit service on the fly.  Deal with making tunnels, crowded connections, weird layouts, and of course keeping all the people going from one place to the next.  In a seemingly endless combination of options, your goal is to move as many people as possible before your mass transit system overcrowds.  Even for those who don’t like management games, this is a gem of game to play through.PROS-	well thought mechanisms to create your metro-	re-playability with high scores -	a real metro look to the maps and layout, beautifully simple and modernCONS-	slightly repetitive-	can be a game you enjoy, but end up leaving after awhileFRENCH PRESSED FULL CUP REVIEWI look down and all I see are triangles, circles, squares, and lines.  Yep, just triangles, circles, squares, and lines. I’m looking at my breakfast. It looks like my Mini Metro transit map of Melbourne. Not that Mini Metro has gotten to me, naaaah.  But look, the toast triangles are so far across my plate that if someone wanted to get to the orange juice glass, they’d have to go right through the eggs.  That’s not going to work.  Especially with my eggs making a river of yolk.   And then, how is my coffee going to get around the bacon?  I’d have to go across the butter dish with a …butter knife bridge, of course.  Wait up, what if I just re-arrange my orange juice with some straws so that it goes through the eggs without messing them up?  Boy, next time I’m just having a breakfast burrito.Welcome to Mini Metro, the seriously competent micro-management strategy transit simulation.  You start with three basic stops in a variety of geographic situations, including several international cities to unlock.  London is one of the first maps and that is where I started.  Your first three stops - circle, square, and triangle - are unfortunately expanding to locales on both sides of a river.  Well, hurry to it, there are passengers waiting already.  Connect the transit lines as efficiently as you can to keep the stations from overcrowding.  People will line up, and they are represented by the shape of the station they are headed to. Easy enough, right?  Except more connections keep popping up and you have to connect them as soon as possible or it will overcrowd on you.  Then, trouble begins.  Lots of people want to connect to the square location, but all the stations on that line are triangles or circles for several stops. Pretty soon it snowballs into a screen teaming with passengers wanting to go to a station is that is nowhere near the next several stops.  So, then comes the strategy bit.  How do you maintain these metro lines?You have the following to work with: metro lines, tunnels, carriages, stations, and later some specialty trains like bullet trains for Osaka and trams for Melbourne.  Unfortunately, you don’t get all of those at once and even what you have is a finite amount.  It comes down to managing resources while you wait for the clock to pass in the hopes of another train to add to the map and relieve some overcrowding.  Connect too many stations and you may make the metro line unnecessarily long, or don’t have enough connections on the wrong side of the map and you’ll be overcrowding quickly with no relief in sight.The rivers can also be tricky.  You get across one, only to run out of tunnels. Multiple tunnels can relieve a lot of stress on the lines, but at the expense of spreading your resources very thin.  I’d find myself with a few lines across the river, only to have a station point pop on the wrong side of the river where I don’t have a good layout of my lines.  Sometimes, you have extra metro lines to take care of those stations on the opposite side of the river, but only if you didn’t opt for more transit cars. You can stop and redo the entire map, though.  That’s the beauty of it.  There are endless amounts of ways to correct the map midway.  Just pause, and retract all the lines.  You can then stop and stare at the screen a bit to see the best way to change it up.  Next, put it all back together and see if it’s better off than before.  I love this part. I’ve got total control to rethink my strategy.  FINAL THOUGHTSI sit back and enjoy the screen once I have a good map in motion –  it’s a bit like looking at a fish tank.  The map is alive, moving to and fro in it’s busy, independent life of it’s own.  And yet it’s got to be maintained, just like an encased ecosystem.  My mini metro fish tank.  The slightest stress on it, and you have a tank of overcrowded fish dying on you.  It’s this quality that makes the game rather relaxing, despite the endless hordes of passengers.I enjoyed the Osaka station the most, with the bullet trains involved.   Hong Kong was also quite frantic as it tended to overcrowd very quickly.  You may find one particular city appeals to you more than others.  It’s an aesthetically pleasing, calming strategic game.  I honestly, never play these type of games but I can see this being something I leave on my PC to calm my nerves after a frantic shooter game.  Perhaps it will come out on a phone app so I can play this on my phone too.  Wonderful game if you like high score games with an intelligent strategy design, feel no hesitation is grabbing it when you can.  Rate 8.5/10.Disclaimer: I was provided a review key from the developer.			"

												People say this game is relaxing when its not relaxing in the slightest.  It is interesting, and it's fun for a while... but its infuriating.... and in my opinion, the difficulty curve is too steep.  The game does not give you enough resources to do much better than 1000 passengers per map, and there's a lot of luck involved.  I could just not be that great at it yet, but with 7 hours invested in to it, I don't feel like I'm getting much better and it's not fun enough for me to want to become better.  I got 7 hours of gameplay out of it for 6$ and I will probably return to it from time to time, so it wasn't a waste of my money, but I expected more from it.  Buy it if its on sale.EDIT OF REVIEW:  I love this game.  I was just... I was wrong, earlier, about this game.  This game is so much ♥♥♥♥ing fun it's ridiculous.  Once you get the hang of it, it gets a lot more fun, because the game allows me to multi-task with the game in windowed mode.  I can watch Netflix, draw sketches, do homework... Really relaxing.  So, yeah.			"

Early Access Review
								An interesting wee sim which looks simple but once things get going it gets hard; fast! Trying to get an ever increasing and swarming maze of stations work in harmony is both fun and infuriating at the same time. I've kept coming back with new ideas on how to make my next play work.What I liked most was how I had to constantly think on my feet as to how to connect this new station in to my network but also how I could use it to ease pressure on other lines. Placing new trains required thought and adding carriages not just a straight forward decision. As the game develops I'm interested to see where this goes and what other real world locations will be included.The game at this stage isn't without its faults. I've found it difficult at times to re-draw lines or disconnect them from stations but this is just nit-picking. Overall Mini Metro is a great game and a fantastic way to kill time, thoroughly recommended.			"

								This game is a very fun graph load-balancing optimisation problem :-)  You have to ensure passangers get to their destination; the tiny shapes indicated at each station/on the subway indicate where they want to go. The trick is that you have a limited number of bridges across water and you can't intersect lines, although you can run them in parallel. The other problem is that it is game over if a station fills up with angry passengers who are waiting for a connecting subway! "

												It's exactly what it looks like: A minimalist puzzle game with a creative concept.That's what you think it is, and you're very correct. The visuals say it all, and convey it all, in a manner that is easy to comprehend instinctively before you purchase. But let me expand on that.The design also conveys information INSIDE the game, not just the trailer. That's important. This type of minimalistic puzzler shouldn't sell you on simplicity and then be hard to understand. Mini Metro does what it promises so clean and so clear that you'll be surprised. It's graceful.In essence, you are free to draw a selection of colored lines between designate points (stations) along a map. When lines are connected, they allow a train car to move automatically from station to station. At each station are a number of small shapes building in a queue. When the train stops at a station, it unloads any shapes (passengers) it is currently carrying provided they match the shape of the station, then grabs the passengers at the station and carries them along its line.This plays automatically for a few turns until new stations appear. Then you need more lines.Soon you have too little carrying capacity and need more trains.As you carry more and more people to their destination, you unlock upgrades that complicate the problem at hand without attaching complications to the mechanics. The additions are fluid. It keeps the experience tight and meditative, albeit a bit stressful because it's (mostly) in real time.As you unlock new cities, the geography and use of tunnels/bridges come into play. Some levels have a faster train car, or a crazier population growth. Keep at it and you'll find yourself organically creating your own tricks: breaking down lines and moving them back and forth between overflowing stations over and over to create shorter paths for your trains, or pausing just so you can flip a train in the opposite rotation for one cycle. Every little decision can change your success.This game works. It is fun.If you've watched the trailer and read even a brief description you'll already know whether or not you like this type of experience. If you DO like it, then this will NOT disappoint you.

Mini Metro Review 
A Video of Mini Metro
By: AidanDVG

			Hello everyone! Welcome to my very first review. Today I look at the Early-Access indie simulation game, Mini Metro. Enjoy! Follow me on twitch for when I go live - twitch.tv/duvangrgataonea Friend me on Steam if you...		


          Our object of interest is Mini Metro, a charming Simulation game in which you take control of a metro and oversee how the lines connect, making tracks with the click and drag of a cursor. The game starts you off in London, a simple town with one obstacle in the middle. If everything goes smoothly, by the end of the week, you gain access to more supplies in the forms of a new locomotive and the choice between another line besides your existing yellow, red and blue ones, or a carriage to add on to an existing locomotive. It’s simple, but charming.          The gameplay is enamorating and captivating, albeit simple. People (I assume they’re people) arrive at one station, and their shape determines where they go. If a triangle person arrives at a circle station, the train picks it up and brings it to a triangle station. The fact that is uses shape-people instead of real people is a good choice. The game never tells you where the people need to go, but you can figure it out on your own. The only thing it tells you is that you click and drag to create a line from station to station. I’m drawn to the minimalist graphics and the fluid look, but what takes the cake is how the game balances your situation. There is never a moment you feel that this is too easy, nor do you feel pressured that your metro will shut down. Oh yeah, if you leave too many people at a station, your metro gets shut down. That’s how you lose.           When the game starts, you are given three separate lines and three stations you need to connect. You might feel drawn to use all three lines, but wait it out and just use one at the beginning. The things you need to worry about most are that you have to have every station covered well, and you have to be efficient. That’s why it is a good idea to never have too sharp of a turn in your line, it slows the locomotives down. I like to have fluid lines that never make a rapid stop. If a new station appears, either use another line that you have been saving, or completely redesign your track as you can delete all of it at once, or take tracks off the edges of a line. That’s the only thing that has annoyed me about this game so far- you can’t take away a track in the middle. If you don’t want your line to stop at that track, but it isn’t on the edge, you have to delete the whole thing.           Overall, I really enjoy Mini Metro. A charming, bright, minimal indie game with just enough challenge to keep me coming back, and just enough variety to keep me playing. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a game that can relax you, but also offers a challenge. If I were to give it a score, I’d say an 8.5/10. I would like more features implemented as the game improves throughout early-access. It’s a great game for a good price, but I wish there was a little more to do. The only gameplay drawback is it is a little awkward to re-route or get rid of metro railways without deleting your entire rail. So all in all, it's a great game for a great price. I implore you to pick it up and I can't wait to see new content added.			"

												Sid Meier says a game is a series of interesting choices. Mini Metro pares right down to the essentials: every single action you take is an interesting choice. You will never quite have all the resources you need to make the system fully efficient, so how will you allocate what you have? Time becomes a resource -- can you afford to spend time to contemplate a better arrangement?Playing in normal mode, each game lasts about 15-20 minutes, so it's nice for when you have a smaller block of time. The interface is more sophisticated than the minimalist-looking screenshots might lead you to believe. The sounds and music are subdued and soothing.			"

								A lovely game that is easy to understand and got three different difficulties, from the more stressful mode to the zen mode.  You connect ""dots"" to let people flow from station to station, and if a station gets too flooded with people game is over.I find the game compelling.Even as it is a bit tricky to come up with the best routes, even the stressful parts of this game feels relaxing.It is good to play for a little while, all from five minutes to a couple of hours. A game I will cherish and return for 10-30mins gameplay on and off for a long time to come I imagine. A refreshing game idea executed in a style I have never seen before.It does feel like it would be a touchscreen/ipad kind of game though (in the most positive manner).In short; a puzzle/brainteaser game with a simple but very nice layout.

												Having played this game since early access I must say that this game has improved immensly. With the addition of sounds and the daily challenge, this game is well worth the price and I would reccomend this game to all who might be interested.ORIGINAL EARLY ACCESS REVIEW:NON-SERIOUS REVIEW:The goal of this game is to build a subway, and then be more sucessful than Rob Ford. Watch your station platforms though, if any of them start to look like Bloor-Yonge Station its game-over and you will have to start over again.SERIOUS REVIEW:Mini Metro is a minimalist game where you build subway stations in an attempt to maintain passenger efficiency. It gets harder as stations randomly appear as the days pass and more people are in need of transit. Like all great puzzle games this one has both a CLASSIC (Commuter) mode and a ZEN (Senic) mode. "

								This is one of the greatest games to play when I'm not in the mood for blowing up stuff. This game is a masterpiece in with evoking a seriously zenergetic feeling (yes I know I just used a made up word that combines zen and energetic into one, but you know what I think? I don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥) The game doesn't require anything to play, purely an open mind that can be plunged into pressure at any moment. Tension and tranquility are two of the most important factors in video gaming for me, and this Mini Metro nails both. I plan on buying whatever games DPC puts out, as their first has been purely spot-on.Some minor issues that you may take problem with before purchasing (I didn't, but some people may):No music or sound. I know this is a major setback for some, but I honestly thought my music library suffices. DPC has stated that there will be audio in the final game (which should be expected of any game anyway), but I don't think it's too big a lack at the moment.A fairly limited levelset. There are currently eight levels, some of which have no major differences. Here's what the devs had to say: Originally posted by peter:We're aiming to release Mini Metro with 5 - 10 playable cities, with more added post-launch.Hopefully we'll get some variation/new obstacles.Lacks content for the price. But it's still fun.Finally, here's my summary/tl;dr/whatever:An amazing game that you should most certainly give money to, minor problems (including lack of music) will be fixed before/by launch. And it's seven f**king dollars. Who can't afford a seven dollar game? And if you for some reason don't want to pay seven dollars for this beautiful creation, then you can wait for the mobile one to be released! I see no reason why anyone should have an excuse not to buy this game.			"

What I liked:  Casual management game that is simply to learn What You Need to Know:  This is not a puzzle game in what most people think, there is no “real” goal. It’s about seeing how far you can go before a station gets overcrowded (always happens around 1,000 people delivered) This is more of an efficiency puzzle game, where you need to optimize and change trains, line and pause the game when you get late game (turns less casual and relaxing if you were looking for that) The game is very simple and it makes it easy to learn, but every level is mostly the same, with the only difference is the amount of rivers that will require tunnels and only 2 different trains, one fast and one smaller that are only available in one level each.(Why not give us a choice of which train each level, would add more depth) Speaking of choices, you get after a week in game, always the only train the game has, and one selection of a new lane, tunnel, or carriage, which the selection is given to you at random. So it might not give you what you need, requires you to think ahead and decide what is need more atm. If you love to optimize stuff in your game, and have yet to play the games below I still don’t recommend this game. I found this forum thread to give you better games that might be more what your looking for https://steamcommunity.com/app/375820/discussions/0/481115363863361128/ My Score: CPaid: Included in $6 Humble Bundle Main reason for dislike: Has so little gameplay depth and content Games similar I recommend that are better:   Factorio = for optimization and designing gameplay, not a puzzle game  Infinifactory and another other Zachtronics games( they make the best puzzles games in this genre)  LYNE =  casual line connecting puzzle game, actual casual game, no optimization  factoryidle = an idle game where you design your factory, has optimation, it’s quite fun  "

												Mini Metro is described as a puzzle game, but to me it is not. A puzzle game, to me, should pose the player with a challenge to which there might be multiple solutions, but the solutions are at least static -- a solution that gives you X points now, gives you X points tomorrow. Mini Metro does not have that, as each challenge consists of the random appearance of random city types, between which you have to draw metro lines, with random upgrades appearing ever so often. Your score depends for a large part on how the random elements appear. The normal game allows you to remove metro lines at a whim, and most players quickly discover a cheesy tactic in this respect which can increase your score considerably. Unfortunately, this cheesy tactic is a chore to pull off, so once you have discovered it, the normal game is no fun anymore. There is still the extreme challenge for each map, which means that each line that you add is there to stay. This makes the game a lot more fun, but unfortunately in the extreme challenge the influence of the randomness on the final result is much bigger than in the normal game, as you cannot make small corrections to deal with the appearance of particularly unlucky cities (which happens quite a lot). Finally, this game suffers from the fact that there is no ""goal"". There are no ""solutions"". You cannot say ""I have solved this map"". You can only say ""I have been able to score 20,000 points on this map"". The next time you play that map, you can try to beat your own score, but why would you? You probably were particularly lucky when you got your high score, and thus you are just replaying to see if you can get lucky again.Despite those negative comments, I still recommend the game. It provides you with several dozens of fun hours, until you have nothing more to discover about the game. Most maps have something unique which sets them apart from the other maps. But once you have discovered each map and found a way to get a score that puts you in something like the top 10% of the players (which generally won't take long), you are done with it. Don't expect this game to have lasting appeal. But the price is right for the amount of fun that it brings.			"

								Obviously — in its beta stages — Mini Metro is a work in progress by a hardworking, dedicated young company genuinely listening to the consumer. But I'm pleased beyond recognition to be part of its maturation. The concept is simple: Keep on top of a rapidly expanding metro system in a wide variety of maps (with more maps on the way) by drawing your own ""map"". As new stations pop up, extend lines, reroute lines, add trains and carriages to existing lines, or pause the simulation, delete the whole thing and start fresh. Each game is different, and each time you learn a little more to add to your burgeoning strategies.My only fault is that the better you get and the longer the game goes, the tedium seeps in. But that's certainly no reason to choose a different map and see what new adventures await on that ever-so-tantalizing blank map.			"

												This is a slightly disappointing game. It revels in its obscurity, expecting you to understand its mechanics as it slowly introduces them. But it doesn't even tell you the *purpose* of the game. There are also some weird bugs, like when you're trying to move a wagon between different lines -- difficult to describe so I'll just say it's glitchy.I also find the game to be too difficult for its own sake. It's more akin to a simulation game than a board game, yet it refuses to give information about stations (such as expected attendance?), and makes it hard to plan your lines ahead.Overall though, there's a deep feeling of satisfaction when playing in endless mode after losing a game, and seeing the trains live their life. I don't know. I'm unlikely to finish the game, and I wouldn't recommend it unless it's heavily on sale, but I can't not recommend it either. So there you go, the thumb up is there for you, you sneaky b*stards.			"

								At first glance, this game may seem simplistic and easy. It really is ""simple"" in what you do, but in design, it's very complex. Start off with a few stations and link them with a subway line. As the game goes on, you get more stations and more congestion. Suddenly you're scrambing to work out where to place new trains, subway cars and lines before your system crashes. Very addictive and very fun!			"

												The game is too committed to minimalism. While that commitment certainly makes the game look pretty, it also leaves the mechanics obscure. I suspect there are some deeper strategic considerations that come into play when deciding which stations to connect with which lines, but the game never explains them at all. Random placement of stations on the maps also makes the various levels all feel pretty much the same. Sure, the rivers are in different places. But that's about it. Regardless of which level you pick, you're randomly connecting randomly placed stations hoping that the randomly spawning passengers don't randomly overwhelm any one station. The game needs a better tutorial or better disclosure of the underlying mechanics. As it stands, it is too opaque to enjoy.			"

												Mini Metro is a devilishly clever game that uses straightforward and simple mechanics to immerse you in 5 to 15 minutes of increasingly hectic gameplay. Each round starts with lulling, zen-like ease and and music to match. As the game progresses and your transit systems becomes more and more complex the atmosphere slowly and imperceptibly shifts until you find yourself racing to pick-up passengers from an over-crowded station with the pace of the music matching your ever increasing heartbeat.Pros:- Easy to learn mechanics.- Enough different mechanics to offer variations in strategies approaches but not too many to over-burden the player with choice.- Great soundtrack and minimalist design.- Great for solo (trying to best your previous scores) or competitive (trying to top the leaderboards) play.- 5-15 minutes of play per round is great for a more casual gaming experience.Cons:- There can be minor bugs from time to time which may take a bit to get fixed but I've never experienced anything game-breaking and the devs are really involved in the community.

								Just to note: I'm reviewing the Early Access version...Oh dear God!  I haven't been able to let this one go.  Okay, so right now there is no sound, no music and only two of the three game modes are complete, but I don't really care!  You see: the gameplay is right there already.  It couldn't be simpler.  Join the map's stations as they appear at random on the map with your available lines (you start with 3) - simple.  That's it.   Ha ha ha ha ha.........  Yeah, right!This game is maddeningly addictive, be warned!  I can't put my finger on why, but I can't leave the game alone.  When you are rewarded, should you take a new line colour, a tunnel or a carriage (yes, just ONE carriage so you'd best add it to whichever train needs it most - correct answer is ALL of them!  Too bad).  To make things more complex, there are rivers and your lines can only span rivers if you have enough tunnel points (you soon won't)!  And just as you sit back to admire your beautiful network of circular, triangular and square stations all running a seamless service - up pops a hexagonal, slice, star or cross-shaped station!  These specials only pop up once, and it really matters where you add these (because you'll soon have a lot of shapes crawling around your network trying to reach them).  At the end of each game week, you are rewarded with an extra locomotive, and a random choice between an additional line colour, a tunnel point or an extra carriage.  You'll actually need them all.  Again, too bad, so sad...The simplicity of the GUI is wonderful.  You can drag lines around, stretching them any which way in zen-like fashion to join up stations as they inconveniently appear on your map.  You can erase lines and rebuild (you'll do that a lot)  Your only goal is not to let any station become too busy - dead simple - except it  isn't!  Already there are tactics evolving in the forum for making temporary lines to shift the load, but that's rather like rearranging deck-chairs on the Titanic.  Your game WILL go down in a Game Over screen.  Get used to it - you'll see it a lot!  Despite this game not being finished, it is already excellent and worth that weeny £4.99.  I'm told that buying direct through Humble will also net you the upcoming Android version (I missed that one).  This is one of those rare gems that is hugely addictive, simple yet clever.  Can't recommend this one enough!			"

								I have a fairly low-spec laptop, and so when a friend recommended this to me, I was terrified it wouldn't run. Even with my crappy processor and such, Mini Metro is an absolute delight to play. It is very simple, yet beautifully complex, and as such I have really fallen for this little gem of a game. You start out with three stations, connect them up, and all of a sudden as soon as new stations come along the game begins to flower as its 'simple yet complex' gameplay unravels. Circle stations are all the more frequent as you progress on your map, and finding ways of connecting these to your busy metro without having two consecutive circle stations on one line quickly becomes a challenging task. (The words 'bloody circle stations' are frequently heard from my room)As each 'week' passes, you gain a new locomotive and can then choose between a new line, tunnels or a carriage, with only a choice between two of the three each 'week'. This element of the game does rather force you to have a strategic approach to your map, and if you do not make a wise choice, you may soon find stations are becoming overcrowded with nothing you can do about it! I love that the way you route lines is not finite and you can rejig lines however you may like if things begin to get complicated. In an odd way, this game has rather given me a new respect for the rail network in real life and how difficult they must be to manage in terms of overcrowding. A very smooth running, pretty game with all the (similar) technicality and strategy of managing a real Underground's overcrowding issues. My highest praise goes to the developers. :)			"

												Solid strategy title, and a shorter/pick up and play one at that to bridge the gap between larger titles. While it's very minimalistic, and the fx/music is pleasant, it stressed me out. Every time a station was about to overcrowd, or I ran out of tunnels to bridge to a new station, or I immediately needed new trains/carriages/lines to alleviate a line, and I was several days away from the Sunday in game time, I wanted to pull my hair out. It's the best 6 hours I've wasted in recency. They pay mind to the small details, such as the train sizes, or train types. Osaka having the bullet train, Cairo having smaller trains for only 4 people. Each city has it's own geography. It definitely has some replay value, if only by your own stubbornness since it gets more and more difficult with the more passengers you have. I doubt I'll ever manage those achievements, but would play again.Every time I complain about transit in my city I remember this game, and I immediately silence myself.			"

								Mini Metro is a fantastic puzzle game with a unique art style and some really challenging mechanics.  I've been following the game since it went into Alpha and it has changed significantly with each update, adding new features constantly.  The beta release added some gorgeous UI tweaks that truly make the game feel like a proper game.  Everything from the typography, to the minimalistic graphic style is absolutely gorgeous to look at.  I can't wait to hear the music, and sound effects when they eventually get added.  The gameplay consists of a mix of puzzle and transport sim, connecting various stations (each a different geometric shape) to one another.  Each station spawns various passengers, which need to go to their corresponding station (Square passenger goes to square station, etc.).  There are so many approaches that you can take to each level that it feels like an open world puzzle game, something i've never quite experienced before.  As the level progresses and the map expands more stations pop up, forcing you to constantly redraw your routes to add the new stations and passengers.  If that station becomes too overcrowded it gives you about a minute before a game over screen.Mini Metro is a refreshing departure from the typical puzzle game, one that can be relaxing, challenging and rewarding all at the same time, all while looking absolutely stunning.  What a fantastic game, can't wait to see what the developer adds to make it better.			"

												I fell in love with Mini Metro from the first time I saw it, when it was the result of the Ludum Dare compo. It had a brilliant strategy of releasing a web-playable demo (RIP Unity Web Player), a demo so good that you could simply play it there and not buy the game.But the guys at Dino Polo Club announced the Early Access, which I propmptly bought, as the potential with this game was really visible. And it did not disappoint. I am someone that is not much into narratives, but rich gameplay, and this is what this game offers: rich, profound gameplay.In Mini Metro, you are the planner of the transportation system of a very abstract city. Stations with specific shapes will pop up all around the city, and characters will pop up in those stations. These characters will wait in the station for a train to pick up them, and the characters's destination matches their own shape. You will be able to lay down the train tracks and, depending on the mode you're playing, you will be able to change them to accomodate a bigger volume of people. If too many people remain in the station, however, the station will overcrowd and a timer will start. If the timer completes, you lose.The best part of this game, though, is the soundtrack. You will not find it anywhere, except on Gameplay videos, as it is generated for all the action that is happening in the level: when characters pop up, when you change the lines layout, etc. The music is composed by the great Disasterpeace, so if you like his music, you'll love Mini Metro's music for sure.

												I have to write a review, since the game finally received an audio update and I couldn't have wished for anything better. It makes the immersion just that much better and completely eliminates any need to put your own background music on. The game is an overall total eye-candy. From the menus, transitions, to the actual game, it's so simple and colourful. Optional features include Night- and Colourblind modes, which are a great addition. There are also fast-forward and pause buttons, so you can get through the early slow start of the game quicker, and pause if you just want to relax or chat with friends, while having the game in the background. The only problem is that it's so addictively fun that you could find yourself neglecting your chat window more often, than the game itself. Developers are also offering a demo version of the first map on their website.Try it out for yourself, it's wonderful!			"

												A fun little game, very challenging and beautiful. I got hooked on it for a couple of weeks, and is definitely worth the money especially since it has been bundled several times.It has a lot of hard achievements. The only problem is that there are still some weird bugs that can crop up that will work against completing them. For instance, I was working on a NYC challenge where I had one line doing a large loop covering the edges of Manhattan, and a smaller loop hitting about six stations  on south Manhattan. As one station started crowding up with passengers who only needed to travel to the next station on the line, I dropped an extra train on the track so that it would quickly pick them up. Instead I watched the empty train blow through the station without stopping. While this may be reminiscent of how some subways operate in real life, it is not how the game is supposed to work. (For the record I only had two other trains on the same loop, and the maximum is four on a single line.) Adding insult to injury, the next train which DID stop only picked up a few passengers and rumbled on about a half-empty. After that it was too late to save the game (over when a station crowds for too long). It ended a mere 200 passengers short of the achievement with no other problem points on a nearly full map. Aargh!!Rating: 8.5/10Excellent gameplay. Needs more bugfixes. "

												Mini Metro is a subway themed puzzle game. Not a true simulator, although it does have elements of simulation in it.A very simple game that lets you focus entirely on the puzzle without anything you don't need to pay attention to, the goal is to connect the stations and get the people to go to a station that matches their shape in an ever expanding city which just keeps getting bigger and bigger until you can no longer handle the influx of people.There are three basic shapes- The square, triangle and circle, and you begin your game having to ferry passengers who each are one of these three basic shapes to a station with the same shape. Square passengers to square stations, triangles to triangle stations, and circles to circle stations. You then get more stations to connect, you have water you need to tunnel under with limited bridges, and eventually you will get unique station shapes to connect up to your lines.While any triangle station is good enough for a triangle passenger, a plus sign passenger will only go to the plus sign station. This means that you will need to keep your lines connected to each other as well as to the three basic stations, and that you will need to figure out where and when to transfer passengers. Losing a game happens when the waiting line at a station is too long, which will slowly fill in a circle around it to show you how close it is to being a game over.Passenger AI is rather simple, but it doesn't need to be complex either. They go to their nearest matching station, using as few lines as possible. An trains pick up passengers as long as they get them any closer at all, even just a single station.Of note is that when a train goes both ways, passengers will not get in on the one that heads away from their destination, instead waiting for a train that heads the right direction.And once you're done with most of this, there is extreme and endless mode. Endless mode is a game without losing, so you can relax and build your subway system without worrying about losing. Extreme mode is similar to the original game, but where you can move and remove tracks and trains at will normally, they are locked into place in extreme mode.On losing a game you can continue playing in endless mode.In the end, it is a simple but worthwhile game to play. It doesn't have a lot of special mechanics, flashy explosions or incredibly detailed environments, but all it does have works towards the same goal - An enjoyable puzzle game you're sure to get plenty of hours out of.

								""Mini Metro"" is like a cross between ""Eufloria"" and ""Cities in Motion"" (if you can wrap your head around that).  It shares ""Eufloria's"" zen-like ambiance, but primarily tasks you with creating subway lines from one location to another.  The map starts you off small with only a few locations (which also consist of varying shapes), but as time goes by, you'll be bombarded with new locations that you'll need to connect to your existing lines.  Passengers have a specific ""shape"" they'd prefer to travel to, so you'll need to make sure that your lines are running quickly and efficiently.  I highly recommend checking this little gem out, it has a lot of potential!

												I love this game so much I've purchased it on Steam for myself, on Humble for a couple of friends, on Android for my Lenovo Book, and on the Apple Store for my iPad. Oh, I ALSO bought it on GOG (because wallpapers).Simple, bold art style; calming music that's not repetitive or in your face; and gameplay that's easy to learn, difficult to master. Leaderboards for challenges, too.If you love puzzle games... and loving metro/subway art is a plus... this is an easy purchase to make.			"

												Mini Metro is a game that hides well its potential. Behind the extreme minimalism, the simple rules and the apparent laid back first minutes of gameplay, are hidden complex strategies, situations messing up with your brain, maps with characteristics constantly changing your gameplay; all in all, an incredibly addicting experience. Despite some frustration I had by the sheer luck you need sometimes, the minor glitches or the small design flaws that appear from time to time, Mini Metro has been a great game for me these past weeks, whether I want to play it cool or to stress out hectically while aiming for the high scores or the tough achievements. It's not a game for everyone, but don't sell the bear's fur before having killed it. Maybe it's the fact that I loved drawing on pieces of paper possible extensions to the existing Paris Métro when I was young that made me love this game so much? Everything can happen...			"

								Saw this while looking through the sale. It wasn't on sale but it looked like exactly the kind of game I was after.Relatively simple to get to grips with, and pretty fun for such a simple idea. Can get very frustrating when one of your stations is full and there's not a lot you can do.I think a few ideas would be to put the colour of the station they want to go to.. could get confusing I suppose but there could be a way to do it. Because the stations are coded by shape, and some are the same, you never really know where they want to go when it gets busy.I don't notice the lack of sound as I listen to music while I play anyway. Overall a very addictive game, and well worth the £5 I paid, and I'll have fun trying out the other levels.			"

								Tl;dr: 10/10, highly addicting, buy it (Also, I now have an irrational hate of simple geometric shapes).Bought this game thinking that it would be a really simple, relaxing, time-killing game; and at first it was. Then, after losing a couple times I got into this ""ok, wait, one more time, I can beat my previous score. Then I found myself looking up actual subway/metro line maps for some ideas; and the better I got, the more I wanted to beat my previous high-score.The only thing that would make this game better (in my opinon) would be music/sound-effects (already being worked on) and some kind of steam achievements.

								Review made 27/10/2014 - Beta 8 VersionMiniMetro is the kind of Early Access game that needs to be placed in the spotlight, leaving the rough, jagged and unfinished games behind. With many early access games I can play it for hours and begin finding errors, or getting ideas of how the game could be made better. And why not? It's Early Access! That's the name of the game, right?Then I played MiniMetro, and I expected bugs, crashes and a dire need for polishing. And, aside from the lack of audio, I found... Well, a brilliant game. There's already plenty of maps, with more to come, and the simplistic nature of the game itself is polished to perfection.This game places you in control of an entire cities' Metro network, ferrying civilians from Stop A to Stop B, as indicated by various shapes. So, for example, there could be multiple people at a stop wanting to get to a Square stop. They will get on the line that has that stop available. As time progresses more stops appear randomly around the map, each with different shapes. As stations demand more stops, you'll quickly ecounter the enemy of the game: over-crowding, which you'll quickly learn is as big and scary a final boss as any other game you'll come across. All you have to do is 'survive' the week to unlock more trains, bridges or routes to be able to satisfy the need of every customer. Once you lose, and you will, your high-score is how many passengers you managed to take from A to B, and the days your service was up and running. It's a very simple and fitting scoring system that leaves you with a burning desire to play again just to beat those numbers.As time goes by you will learn to love or hate certain shapes, with particularly rare shapes getting high demand, but being in a particularly hard to reach location. I have come out of many playthroughs wishing circles were never invented, and that Triangles are satan-spawn.The pacing is fast and challenging, the only reprieve you can find being in the Pause button. The art style is minimalist and simplistic, obviously reminiscent of an Underground map. The replayability is seemingly endless, with stations appearing at random locations each time, alongside various different maps each with their own individual high-scores.I love this game, it's worth every penny, and it should be considered a complete game with incoming updates as far as I'm concerned. While it's still in Early Access though, I will suggest one thing that would be nice but is not entirely necessary: Stats for each station/line to see how many passengers are travelling on each, allowing you to micro-manage everything much more meticulously.10/10			"

												Duration - 4 hoursUnlocked and played all cities. Obtained all ""basic"" achievements. 16/32 Mini Metro is a fine little game where you place tracks and eventually get overrun by commuters.  The game uses a score system, so there is no ""solution"" which is why I avoid calling it a puzzle game.  Also, the set-up and progression is different so there is no ""optimal"" solution to work toward like in SpaceChem.  Overall, it was a fine expenditure of relaxed time, with most cities taking 5-6 minutes to play.			"

								A decievingly simple puzzle game. This game puts you in charge of connecting railway lines to circles, triangles, squares etc and your job is to make sure none of those stations get over crowded which seems simple enough and after the first 5 or so minutes of play you will believe that this game is easy but soon you will realise that it is not all that easy as more stations are made and passengers are made faster making you think constantly of a better way of handling the situation at hand. Will you make annother line to take the load of annother? Will you add more trains to make one line more effective? Will you add more carriages to your trains so they can carry more? Will you add more tunnels so you can get to those areas on the otherside of the lakes? You will have to make all these decisions in this game.-Gameplay-The gameplay is very simple, you draw lines to shapes and deliver shapes to other shapes. You have to make sure no stations become over crowded or you lose the game. The score is determined by how many 'peeps' you have delivered. You will get a train and a choice between 2 upgrades at the end of the week, currently there are (2 Tunnels, a carriage or a new line) these get randomised each week and you have the choice between 2.-Conclusion-Overall the game has a great concept and is executed very well with only a few missing features. Music is a main thing currently not in at the time of this review but of course this will be implemented in the future. I give this game a 9/10 for being unique, fun, exciting and overall intense as you make those quick second decisions. I can see this game going a long way with the 'Wishfull' features that may be implemented such as 'Multiplayer' 'Scenerario Editor' and more. If you are looking for a game you can sit down and play for 20 minutes then this is definately it. I Highly recommend checking this game out especially for the low price it is at. Video:

												It is the end of the school year and, as a school teacher, I ampretty much left with nothing to do while waiting for summer break. So, there is this day when I am done with clearing my seat (we were renovating our office) and was sitting with my Macbook Air (MBA in short) looking for something to play. My steam would not download any games in school as the school has blocked all gaming sites (IP I presume), even for staff, and I am too lazy to set up a VPN. My MBA could not handle anything that is too graphical (if you know what I mean), so I went and start Mini Metro. The game is minimalistic, easy to understand, and fun. It is simply connection lines, shapes and moving rectangles that are presumably train carts. There is nothing intriguing about it, yet it is simplistically attractive, bite size (a game last around 3 to 5 minutes) and an extremely effective remedy for symptoms arised from office boredom, such as yawning and drowsiness. After a couple of rounds, my boss, the department head, walked pass. She looked at my monitor, and asked, ""are you playing a game?""It took me around two seconds to give her an appropriate. ""Nope. I'm working on a set of powerpoint slides for my class."" ""Oh, okay."" She walked away after that.Well, that worked well, except that I no longer have any classes after that. Still, great game for these kind of situations. "

												Mini Metro is a cool little indie simulation/management game with minimalistic art. You construct a metro (or tram) network on abstract maps based on real world cities. The goal is to transport as many passangers to their destinations as you can without letting any single station overcrowd.The core concept is great and the abstract artwork is a perfect fit for the game. Connecting the stations is fun and later on things get quite hectic as new stations keep popping up and you need to readjust your metro lines and reposition trains to avoid overcrowding.Unfortunately the game suffers from lack of depth. The core gameplay is rather simple and the different cities feel fairly similar despite the few unique gameplay elements. There are leaderboards and a few different gameplay modes, but I still felt that the game could have used some more content and variety.Mini Metro is still a fun experience and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes abstract management or simulation games.The good:- Great concept- Fun gameplay- Art style fits the game wellThe bad:- Poor tutorial- Could have used more variety with the cities- Moving trains around feels bit too powerful at times			"

								As of Beta 2:Pretty good puzzle game. Very minimalistic, very slick and very challenging. Only one mechanic, but a really polished one.Just connect the stations in an optimal way to deliver the passengers all over the city. But don't think that it's gonna end there - stations tend to change quite frequently, so you'll have to adapt to those changes.Still, game needs some love on some (pretty minor) UI parts. Additional game modes wouldn't hurt. Plus, more ways to vary gameplay would be good as well.More details in the video:

 Mini Metro	 is minimalist puzzle game themed around mass transportation. The goal is to pick up and deliver passengers by connecting stations to your system with a limited number of resources based on trains and lines. With a design that is both sleek and intuitive, the game requires little in terms of explanation for a new player. It's so easy to pick up that it comes as a shock when the game suddenly crushes your pathetic metro system under the weight of cruel reality. Pros	 Clean, minimalist design that ties into the transportation theme Puzzles are easy to understand but ramp up in difficulty Randomized station generation offers replayability Advanced strategies are not instantly apparent and require some experimentation for those looking for a challenge Mellow ambient music lowers your rage as passengers overload your metro system Cons	 Crushes your dreams of being a transportation engineer Randomized station generation means some thematic elements are lost; ie. you won't be building the exact replica of the London Tube Maps are devoid of placenames to connect you to the actual cities featured in the game The game always ends with you losing; only solace is how far up the leaderboard you can goThe negative points about randomized station generation and lack of thematic depth should be taken with the caveat that these were obviously purposeful choices, made to elevate the minimalist design. I personally found the game very enjoyable and would recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting take on transportation games.			"

								This game is great for how simple the concept is. When I first saw this game I though that just drawing lines would not be fun at all. Now, I Mini Metro is one of the cheapest, yet best games I have bought on steam. For just $6 this game is  really well made. I think for the basic concept of making a underground system this game can bring you hours of playing. Time will fly when you play this game. It is also very simple to learn. You literally just move your mouse and draw lines and sit and relax. In Mini Metro you have a limited amount of lines, trains, and underwater tunnels. You can play for a minute or for two hours. If you have been to any city or place this game features you may have some familliarity to the map. I think it is a great value for such a cheap game.

												A strategy game where you have to build a city metro and make sure it doesn't get overcrowded. Very minimalistic and beautiful design with music that perfectly suits it. It’s not a huge game where you’ll spend hundreds of hours but a nice little game that you play when you have free half an hour and just want to spend it relaxed playing a simple game. Controls are easy to understand (you only need to point and click with a mouse).10€ might be a little too much but if it is on sale and you want it – just buy it! "

												Mini Metro is a great game that has given me hours of fun. I bought it in a recent Humble Bundle for it specifically and after a few hours I'm comfortable giving it a thumbs up, despite the criticisms that I am now about to lay out.My first caution is that, while the game is well designed and enjoyable, its content is a little thin for the sticker price of $10. There are 12 cities, and while there are some unique quirks between them, the only other practical difference is where the rivers are located. Most end up playing pretty close to the same way. It will still take you a while to invent and explore all the possible strategies for building your metro, but after about 10 hours I found my interest waning as there wasn't much else to spice things up. The three game modes help in this regard.That said, what content is there makes for quite a challenge. It's a perfect example of a game that gives you a small set of tools that can be combined to make incredibly complex systems.I also see some room for improvement with the UI. I like the game's minimalist graphics, but the interface takes this a shade too far. There were a few things that bothered me:1. Trains/carriages are a bit hard to see, being the same color and only slightly larger than the tracks, and often obscured by other objects. It's very difficult to see where everything is at a glance. Something to help them stand out, like a black outline, would be a big help.2. The stations have the opposite problem. They stand out well, but they're all the same color, differentiated only by shape. It's easy to lose track of where specific stations are since many look alike.3. Some more feedback in the UI would be nice (at least in sandbox mode, if it would make things too easy on normal/expert). Perhaps some summarized info about each line, like number of passengers waiting, number of trains/carriages active, average wait time. There's a stats page that has some of this info, but it's on a separate screen several clicks away.4. Speaking of the stats page, the minimalist design doesn't work so well there. Having to mouse over each data point to see numbers does not for easy reading make.In conclusion, Mini Metro is a simple but deep game that plays pretty much as advertised. Perhaps a bit lacking in content for full price, but still a solid pick for anyone who likes puzzle/strategy type sims.Edit: The more I play this game, the more I crave more features. I love the challenge but it's actually kind of frustrating how many times I think ""gosh it would be nice if I could do X to make my metro more efficient"", but alas, X is beyond the scope of gameplay. This really is perfect as a casual, pick-up-and-play mobile game, but if you're used to more in-depth sim type games, proceed with caution.			"

												I've been playing this off and on since the first free online version. It's so simple to learn and impossible to master. At a certain point it become a beautiful musical zen toy. The Daily Challenge and Extreme Mode unlocks are a nice touch to keep me coming back.It seems like the different cities tweak numbers under the hood, but they don't feel that different to me. My only real complaint is that I wish there was a speed option to go even faster than fast. If you're on the fence, go play the free version and if you like that you'll love this.			"

												Greetings fellow gamers! This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of an intriguing little puzzler, Mini Metro.

The ""Too Long, Didn't Watch"" Review:Fantastic little puzzler. The art-style and music are enchanting. Easy to play, hard to master. Addicting 4/5The ""Meat & Potatoes"" Review:I wasn't quite sure what to expect with this little thing. A transportation puzzler. Open and run lines to maximize efficiency. Seems simple enough, right? Especially since this isn't crazy detail, it's just lines and shapes. You get rolling, and there's this catchy, soothing music that gets going along with your lines and station placement....next thing you know, you just can't stop! You've got lines going everywhere, you're hoping to level up then dreading the decision of which perk you want (More Tunnels or a Carriage? Another Line or an extra Locomotive?). It can get rather intense on you pretty quickly. There are different levels of difficulty, daily challenges, high scores, scenario unlocks, etc. There is a ton of replayability. The visuals and the music are pleasant, enchanting and beautiful. Very nice touch for a little puzzler, really. I also genuinely thought I would take issue with the $10 price point, but cannot see a problem with that. now It is worth $10. I keep going back. It is nearly impossible to play just one attempt. 4/5 stars for this one, gamers. It's so much fun, once you try it you will get hooked!  Happy Gaming!!!			"

			Mini Metro Is a Subway Simulation Time Management Strategy Game. Available Here: Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/287980/ HomePage: http://dinopoloclub.com/minimetro/ Join us at Twitter or...		

     Mini Metro is a line based simulation strategy/ time based subway system. The art style is simplistic, and the gameplay is basic. You are in charge of a city subway system, and are responsible for transporting people from one station to another. You lose the game if you let the stations get overcrowded. The game is time management based, with new upgrades available every week when you successfully complete a week as a reward. There are a multitude of different levels and content, and each map of mission has its own leader-board, which can add to the competitive feeling as you play.      There are daily challenges, which is appreciated, but there is no expected level of completion, such as 500 people transported. This I feel takes away from any incentive a player might have towards these goals. The leader-boards for these challenges show the top 10 people, but don't give motivation or incentive for what you have accomplished on a personal level as games are meant to be personal.     Another aspect that may only appeal to certain players is that the game states directly that you cannot win. There is no end game. The game keeps growing, with new stations, complications, and population, to the point that you will not be able to keep up. You will not be able to grow your subway empire, simply manage the time you have to the best of your capability. If you enjoy time management games, this might be for you; the game is very basic- a simplistic casual game for those who find casual games too demanding.     The game mechanically give you exactly what it promises. For the current asking price of $10 dollars, I cannot recommend it, but if it were on sale, and this type of game appeals to you, then go for it. This is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to watchif you are looking for a more in-depth review.Thanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here. http://www.youtube.com/c/SocioPsycho "

												I have less than two hours of gameplay in this and I've already seen everything there is to do.  I wasn't expecting too much, but was still disappointed by the lack of gameplay ;  you will be spending much more time looking at the game than interacting with it.  At a certain point it turns very suddenly from a laid back and easy game to an overwhelming and impossible race against the passengers, which may have been an intentional mechanic by the developer to end the game before the player notices that there's nothing more to do.  Unfortunately the endless play mode ruins this concept and makes it very obvious that there isn't much left to see. This game is very beautifully designed and has a relaxing soundtrack so it would have been a good purchase at a fraction of its price, but for $10 I was really expecting much more than I got.While this game looks appealing, don't buy it if you're expecting any more than an hour of entertainment.  If you're going to get it, wait for a sale and you'll get a better deal.			"

								This game is AMAZING! The graphics look excellent, it is challenging, fun, addictive and more. You get a map of a city with a few stations you work out where you want the lines to go, you get three lines to begin with and three locomotives. If you make it through to the next week (Sunday) you get to choose if you want to get a new line, tunnel or carriage as well as a locomotive which can be used on any current line or saved for a new line that you choose to build.This game is very impressive and it is still being developed, I am excited to see what the final result is as I already think this game fully deserves a 10/10 rating. It is well worth the £4.99 I spent on the game.			"

												Mini Metro is one of those hidden gems that was destined to be hidden.The graphics are clear, crisp. The colours are used precisely and in a thought out manner. It's well animated too. The fluididty is perfect for this type of game.As for the gameplay: The premise is simple. You have shapes dotted around the map. Those are stations. Each station will have passengers pop up, all wanting to go to a different shape station. The goal is to get them there quickly and efficently without the stations filling up.Difficulty's added by the limited amount of trains and lines, adding new shapes and stations and also having to sometimes go through water with a limited amount of tunnels.It's difficult, I'll say that much. I completed ""Deliver xxx amount of passengers"" achievements, but I never managed to complete the more difficult achievements. So, if you like becoming efficent in a single game, then this is perfect for you.One gripe though: Everything's slightly randomized. Because of that, some runs are doomed from the start. Like for example I had to instantly spend a tunnel because the station was slightly touching the water. You can't really move the tracks, so that couldn't be done either. Overall:7/10(All games start at a neutral 5/10 and move up and down based on their pros and cons)			"

								In Mini Metro your goal is to keep small towns or districs from becoming too crowded in a major city. Seems simple and easy, right? Well it is surprisingly difficult. You envelope quite a bit of time into each playthrough to devolpe a efficient transportation system. Whenever you achieve a smooth system, you get a great feeling of satisfaction. I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategic games or is just looking for a game to kill a few hours. 12/10  Superb.			"

												A truly wonderful game. Can be enjoyed casually (just link up your network at random) but there really are more effective strategies. Each city has a unique feel because the random features (station positions and type) may be tweaked to give different proportions of station types and proportions of stations of different types on different land masses. Also, some cities have unique features like the Osaka shinkansen (fast trains) or slightly different weekly choices.There are basic achievements for each city, which lets you work out the basic mechanics of the game. Then there are more demanding achievements, with extra restrictions like only having tunnels on one line, and a much more demanding passenger target. These require a more efficient network since your network will start to crack under the strain well before you reach the passenger target. If the earlier incarnations of your network (when you have most opportunity for radical changes since there are not so many passengers) weren't efficient enough, then you likely won't make it (although you might if you're very lucky!).

								Metro leaves you in control of stations in the area you have chosen, passengers will arrive at a station and show a little icon as to where they would like to go, your job is to create train runs to different stations, trying to connect as many passengers to the stations they would like to go to, but also as quickly as possible.   Each week you are given an option of an upgrade, for example you could choose an extra line, or an extra carriage.  If passengers are left too long without being picked up by a train, the game ends. I have played this a couple of times and I really like it.  I look forward to music being added, but i'm not too fussed right now as I know its early access and will be added later on.  This is a fun little game and I can probably see this being released on tablets in the near future (maybe).30/03/2015 -  I've continued to play this game, dipping in and out every now and then.  The updates have continued to improve the game and I still enjoy it now as much as I originally did.  Keep up the great work.  I can see this working well on tablets too. (Unless it already is and i've missed that).			"

								This game is qutie a lot of fun, and it's different game modes make it even more versatile. It's new and is being updated with new features, but the updates are coming with surprising frequency and there are still many planned features that they are currently working on. I bought it not on sale and I dod not regret it.Regular mode is fun and frantic and is even more fun with a friend watching and giving recommendations (being that friend is also fun). The most part is when you realize how out of hand everything is and make emergency modifications so you can stay in for just a bit longer.Zen mode is great if you're burned out from a day of work and just need to sit back and do something simple. It still requires some thought but lacks the franticness of normal mode.This is a good game to play at almost any time you feel like playing a game, and it's my fallback for when I don't feel like playing anything. Highly recommended.			"

								*EARLY ACCESS REVIEW*This is a really fun game.  If you enjoy looking at subway maps and playing an engaging puzzle game - then this game could be for you.  The gameplay is simplistic yet challenging.  As time progresses, subway stations appear ""randomly"" and you are tasked with connecting the stations to one another by drawing subway lines in any way you see fit.  Different stations consist of different shapes you'd typically see on a subway map (i.e. dots, squares, stars, etc.).  there are a limited number of trains, carriages, and tunnels at your disposal and every game turn (one week) you get to choose what you would like to buy.  Sometimes, it pays to buy an additional subway line to start a new line with or sometimes it pays to buy an extra carriage if there are a lot of passengers at your existing lines.  And always keep track of those river crossings with tunnels - make them count as you can only do so many of them each game (unless of course you buy more each game turn).  What keeps the game fun, fresh, and engaging for me is the ability to change subway lines as additional stations randomly appear - you are not stuck with what you originally drew.  You have the flexibility to continue to change and evolve your strategy and layout of your subway grid as time goes on and passengers appear in greater numbers.  This mechanic is what keeps the puzzle game aspect engaging - rather than just an exercise of draw some subway lines and sit back and watch the map come to life (which can be fun too!) Since the game is early access, they currently have London, Paris, and New York City to start with but there are additional cities (such as Sao Paulo and St Petersburg) that are greyed out but should be playable soon.  Also, sound is currently disabled and there are other game modes not enabled but this is something to look forward to has development continues.			"

Early Access Review
								(TL;DR @ bottom)I've been playing the alpha versions of this program for a few months now. It's a very relaxed puzzle game, in which you link lines from different types of stations in order to allow passengers to reach their desired type of destination. As the game goes on the map slowly expands and adds/changes stations to force you to keep expanding/upgrading. I recommend just ignoring the score and let yourself just focus on trying to find the best way to flow the traffic for as long as possible. Mini Metro is great for when you just want to relax; personally it’s good for recovering from rage-inducing moments other games cause.Pros: -Simple, Zen-like game-Minimalist graphics that are spot on for the theme.-Easy to learn, plenty of ways to try and experiment with the growing map to keep going.Cons:  (Since the game is beta, these will likely change in time)-No tutorial yet, so most the ways you can interact with the board have to be figured out on your own.  -No sound effects/music. The music is simple to solve, but other audio effects would be nice.-If you’re still reading, 15 points to Gryffindor. (Bloody gits)My tip for figuring out the controls: Experiment of course. You can click-drag about anything (stations, ends of lines, mid-lines) you don't like, It'll Highlight/grey out if you can/cannot do something respectively. Currently, the lack of audio is a downer, but the minimalist art style (and Zen theme) go well with a bit of Jazz. Just start GrooveShark.com (or Pandora, etc.), theme search for jazz and hit play; I'm good for an hour.TL;DR = Very relaxing puzzle game. Art-style can draw you in. Simple to play, enough challenge to keep it interesting with little stress. You’ll have to provide your own music (I recommend Jazz).			"

												This game could use a bit more explanation in the tutorial -- once I had finished it, I still had no idea how to move train tracks without deleting the entire line, and several other features also went unexplained. (Did you know that you can press the space bar to pause the game and still move lines around? Speaking of a game changer!) Fortunately the Steam community has created some great guides that provided me with all the information that I was missing. Once I understood the game, it proved to be a lovely minimalistic puzzler that has you trying different things to find the most optimal routes and keep the game running. It is quite challenging, but without getting too frustrating. If a run isn't working out so well for you, well, there's always the next one!Very cool game idea that was well executed.			"

								Mini Metro. Simplicity at its finest.The idea is simple: get passengers from station to station by building railways.The UI is simple: Click and drag to draw railways through stations.The rules are simple: No more than four trains on one track, and if any station gets overcrowded you lose.From these simple principles emerges chaos. Sheer, utter, beautiful chaos - fueled by the ever increasing number of stations you have to cater for, and driven by hasty changes to your Metro to try and provide routes for passengers to take in order to get to their destination ASAP.And yet, despite how chaotic things get, you can still employ strategy and make reasoned decisions at every turn. At the start of a new game you might choose to stick to one design philosophy or another, leading to experimentation to see which is the most effective.This, coupled with the randomly generated stations, makes the game very replayable and, if you appreciate the slow pacing, very fun.Despite this, that's all there is to it, really. After 2 or 3 hours of play you've pretty much seen it all. I imagine, after a few more hours of play, I'll probably get a little bored. In my mind, it's something I'd return to whilst waiting to do something else - in a role similar to Super Hexagon.Highly recommended if you're looking for a fun little game to play whilst rendering a video or waiting to do something else.

												Worths it at > -50% or get it from bundles. It is good but the fun exhausts fast.Pros- Elegant design- Language options and translations are good. Appreciated that there is Chinese (Hong Kong) for selection. They do realise all those who live with metro in their cities will play this game!- I can't even notice the map is zooming out! This is some kind of magic I appreciate.- Attention to real life details. Being a Hong-Konger, this game surprised me with all the colors of lines taken from real life railways we have here, they even put the colors of the major lines first.Cons- Lack of instructions and descriptions for some choices- Stations randomly pops up at locations unreachable e.g. requires bridge, highly relys on luck esp. in early games- Kind of frustrating when you fail: there is almost nothing you can do to save a station from overcrowd- Reconstructing lines could make you fail almost immediately if you don't have spare cars to handle the rush of passengers right after re-drawing the lines- not much difference in strategy for different maps- music is annoying in late games			"

												Great little game. Very simple concept, but with the little variations and the random placement of stations every game feels slightly different.But the randomness also means that some games are easier than others. Another criticism is that the game isn't bug-free and seems unfinished. E.g. there are some achievements for maps that are not in the game. What's worse is that the tunnel counter is buggy and I have seen trains drop cargo in weird places, although this is very rare.If you like optimization, this is a good game to get.			"

								Mini Metro is very minimalistic in design and the mechanics can be easily grasped after a few plays. I like the colour scheme and the simple shapes. Pity there isn't any relaxing music and sound effects so far, it'll definitely make the game experience a lot more engaging, like, say, a beeping sound when a station gets too crowded. The game can be quite repetitive, but as someone who likes playing task-oriented games, it's perfect for me. I think introducing trophies would be a good idea to create a sense of achievement, and also introduces a challenge for players.			"

												Mini Metro is a realy simple but fun game to play. In the game you have certain 'points' on the map, that can look like a circle, square, triangle etc. Those 'points' represent metro stations. From time to time smaller icons like a circle, square, triangle etc. appear next to these metro stations. Those smaller icons respresent a traveler who would like to go to another metro station. For example, a smaller triangle on a circle metro station, would like to take the metro to a traingle metro station. If the traveler steps in, it will not go out until it reaches a triangle station. But it will step over on a different line if it can reach such a station faster. When you start you will just have a few metro stations, and a few lines. Every week you get more lines / locomotives / carrages or tunnels. Somethimes you will get a choice if you want for example a new line, or a new locomotive. You also have different maps to play, that are named like cities, like London, Paris, Hong Kong. Also in the game you only use the left mouse buttons, that is everything. I would say a great game if you would like a simple strategy game, but you also start a new map very soon. Becasue you get 'game over' eventualy.			"

								I didn't know it was possible for a game to be relaxing and stressful at the same time, but this game seems to accomplish that (although you can easily take out the stress element by playing on endless mode, if that's your thing). Thanks to this, I now understand why subway maps are so convoluted.In short, this game is a combination of some of the best core elements in all train-management-style games in a beautiful, minimalistic style. Seriously, the animations and visual design of this are just AMAZING. Well done. Although I'm hoping audio gets added soon, because the sounds in the trailer made the game seem even better.Highly reccommended to anyone who likes any sort of strategy or planning game, or just needs some way to relax.

												Mini Metro is very fun addictive little game that focuses purely on designing efficient routes to bring passengers that come as shapes to different stations. The visuals, audio and game play is very minimalist but definitely in a positive way. Various challenges (the achievements) keep you motivated to play the game for about 10 hours top I would say. Unfortunately the game lacks any kind of depth that could have been easily added (E.G by adding weird bonus maps with lots of water, or a mode where certain shapes could only take certain trains). With that in mind, I DON'T think the game is worth the €10,00 that it's currently sold for due it's lack of variety in game play. Worth picking up when < 5€			"

								This game is absolutely fantastic. Its minimalism is a testament to how far a game can go with just a few very nuanced mechanics. This elegance is carried through into the visual design, everything is so crisp and bright. With just a few deep mechanics and such great ux/ui design Mini Metro is the very epitome of ""easy to learn, hard to master."" I recommend this to anyone, for the price. Even if you don't get hooked completely, you'll still get several hours of enjoyment out of even just the first map. Oh did I mention it has leaderboards? Find out which one of your friends is the undisputed Marquis of Metro!			"

								Very good game for guys who just want to relax. Simple & fun! Easy to play and feel the happiness.There are a small problem to start the game....it always goes to the left one instead of begining on this map.(You can press enter instead.) I hope this game will be available someday in Appstore or Google play for smart phones. (This game is more suitble for killing your short free time on the road, in the toliet or just waiting for someone instead of sitting in front of your PC.)Overall, a very good game with novel ideas! 7/10			"

The gameplay is quite simplistic however the strategy for the game is a constant learning experience, and before you know it, hours will have passed by without you realizing.  I look forward to see what additions they will make to the game in the future.EDIT:  The game is no longer in Beta and I like the improvements that they have made.

												Mini Metro is a very simple game, but that is one of its strengths, but for gameplay and as a stylistic choice. Anyone who's ever been fascinated by maps, and specifically transit systems, will love this game. It may seem like a niche interest but working towards making an efficient metro system can actually be highly addictive. The game is easy to start playing but hard to master, which is perfect when the ultimate goal is the just the tried and true persuit of a high score.Mini Metro offers a wide range of cities, some of which must be unlocked by scoring at a certain level on previous cities. Despite aiming for simplicty, there are a number of creative ways cities are differentiated, such as station type spawn patterns and different asset constraints.If the game were just this it would probably have limited longevity, but where it really shines for some is in the daily challenge. Once per day there's a random seed generated on a given map that everyone gets *one* shot at, and then placed on a leaderboard. This is great for those who are competitive but also don't want the hassel of setting up something more complicated or can't invest much time most days. Also great for just casual challenges in a circle of friends.Overall Mini Metro is a simple game with a set purpose, but nails that purpose right on the nose. If this game seems like your thing I'd recomend checking it out. If you're on the fence it still might be worth checking out when it goes on sale.			"

UI The UI is brilliant, an easy simple great looking interface. Love the graphics of the subway trains running in the background. Graphics Brilliant game play for a small game. There are many maps to choose from in which you will have to score a certain amount of points to unlock the next map (level). They become harder and harder to build your rail the longer you last. There are many different game play modes which makes the game a easy chilling or a hard thinking strategy game. I would recommend this game  "

												Mini Metro is a simple little and mildly addictive puzzle game. You can play it quickly - 20 - 30 minutes will usually be enough to play.  It is a game where you have to link different cargo supplying spots and manage the trains linking them.  You are building an Underground network trying to survive the hectics of a modern metropolis. All games you start end the same: after an increasing amount of cargo you cannot move on time, one of your stations will be overfull and the game ends.The maps are simple and reflect the colours of tube maps of the different cities you can play. I like the layout of the maps. The sounds are suttle and pleasing. Different deliveries make different little sounds, and is relaxing.If you are looking for a train simulation game, this is not it.If you are looking for a simple game where you have to create and recreate a system to optimally move different forms around (stars, blocks, rounds etc) - and look for optimal efficiency with the knowlegde that in the end you will never reach a status quo - it is nice enough.

There is a ton of content here, and plenty to keep you busy for quite a long time. There is no set path to passing a level, and the levels themselves unfold differently every time that you play them. It truly is a polished gem that more than delivers considering it's price. This is a challenging yet soothing game that you can lose yourself in for a few hours at a time. Highly recommended.			"

												This is an elegant puzzler that has you constructing stylized light rail lines in big cities and avoiding overcrowding at your stations for as long as possible. There's not much else to it other than daily challenges with leaderboards, a mode that makes all your tracks permanent and a mode that disables terminal overcrowding. It's kind of like if Train Valley was a survival game.The two main problems are that the music (which is automatically generated from train movement and passenger sounds) might get grating after a while, and that stations pop up seemingly randomly enough that games are as much up to chance as they are up to your on-the-spot problem solving ability. That last one's not so much of a problem if you can handle stress and are good at performing triage, but Cities in Motion this ain't. I do recommend this - I can see it being something you play while you're commuting yourself. Bonus points for having a night mode, at any rate.			"

								I ran into this at PAX and was smitten immediately. It is so hectic and yet Zen and peaceful. Like many of my favorite games, it's more about what's happening in your head than what's on the screen.This is a traffic routing game where you draw subway lines to take little shape people to the matching station shape. People appear in real time, but you can pause and redraw your map at any time. You use little rectangular trains, a few colors, a few bridges to cross rivers.The art is straight out of the classic London Underground map. But you get to make the map, in a stylized but real world city with its geography (eg London, Paris, Berlin, New York).As you deliver more passengers, you meet the challenges of growth. New stations crop up in outlying areas, forcing you to take apart the ingenious system that worked so well before and think again. New shapes of passenger and station appear, making it impossible to service all shapes with any one line. But they will transfer along the shortest route, which means you want your trains to meet at some stations. Mix in a long haul train line? Maybe you want to add a passenger car to accommodate all the people that build up as it makes its slow way.The stations and demand are randomly placed every time. The gameplay is the same every time, but the random map constantly challenges your understanding of these systems.I'm having a great time with it.			"

												I saw this game on the summer flash sale, and it looked interesting, so I scooped it up. Boy am I glad I did! This is a fantasic, little, indie, strategy game where you are managing a subway station. Your job is to lay down subway lines to connect the different stations and get the different shapes (people) to their desired destinations. It starts off slow and progressivley keeps adding more and more, so you really have to think about where to place the lanes to be the most efficient. It's super easy to learn, but will take some time to master, and it's absurdly addicting. This is an early access game but complely 100% playable. There is no music/audio yet, but that will come out soon. They use a very minimalistic art syle, which adds to it's clean look and makes it easy to understand, however, a few things might need to be clarified. Hopefully they will add a small description for the different items you have to choose from between weeks. There are a few I'm not completly understanding what they do or how they work. The beginning tutorial is very simple, although they do not show you how to move tracks or divert them. I kinda found that out by accident, so hopefully they will expand on a few of these things.I also hope they make it possible to save some of your games/city tracks you have made in a future update.Overall this is an awesome little game, that is well executed, and 100% worth the full asking price. 10/10			"

Out of nowhere comes a diamond station and everybody wants to go there. So you throw down another line all smug-like and watch the numbers building.EZPZ!! 200, 300, 400, 500... Oh. What? I have no bridges? I''ll go around. 550... Wait. What? Why is that station overcrowding? Aha.. I'll just add a carriage. No?? A train then? Errr. Nope. Reroute, reorganise... Ahh that's better.... AHA, a new station. I'll just link that with the blue line. Oh oh. Can't cross... Oh. What do I do?? Aggghh!! Game over. You managed to shift 578 people in 48 days. Dammit.

												There is a hell and it is circular. ---You will enjoy this game. I enjoyed this game. It is deceptively simple and allows you to cultivate your own preferred playstyle in the absence of any substantive tutorial and with an overly compliant difficulty curve geared towards early success. As someone looking to recline and take in some enjoyment, Mini Metro is sleek and superb - accept the invite and try it, and there's a number of solid hours of glee as individual levels are 'beaten:' with the player ultimately losing, or retiring, with enough points cached to earn an achievement. Mini Metro then politely deadlocks the door and insists that if you want to reach the high scores, to obtain the achievements which are (in this context) the only real signifiers of completion, you'll have to put up with obnoxious RNG and unfavourable spawns. You will  require  some kind of bizarre foresight to overcome the random placement of the map's stations: four of one kind a row, with the game neglecting to provide you in the weekly update (in-game-time) with the upgrade you require (a tunnel, line, carriage, or whatever it may be given the precise circumstance), and Mini Metro quickly becomes an unpolished turd. The fact that the most exclusive achievements are possessed by a fraction of a percent of the playerbase in the port of a phone game should be evidence enough. Mini Metro is fun, but more of a joyous minimalist idea than a polished, concise video game experience:  there is no win state except that which is self-imposed, and if your self-imposition relies even remotely on Steam achievements, then your win state is a monumentous gamble away. I'd have recommended this game for the first 6-8 hours I played it. Now I'm triggered, several attempts at one of the level's achievements later, and I no longer think it is worth the time: other reviewers have praised this game's reward structure, but I think it undeserving. ~			"

												Good. Insanely good. Not since RCT II have I found as an addictive and mezmorizing game as Mini Metro.At first, you think ""It's a puzzle game!""  No.And then you think ""It's a sim game!"" No.And then you think ""It's a strategy game!"" No. It's all three. And a logistics game too.  The beauty of the game lies in its simplicity and its elegance. No fancy graphics to chew up your computer speed. No messy noises to ruin your hearing. No time consuming constructions to build.  It basically takes you back to when strategy/sim games were simple, eloquent & easy to learn how to play... and nearly impossible to master. Taking a few queues from SimCity, Locomotion, Railroad Tycoon & RollerCoaster Tycoon II, Mini Metro is incredibly easy to learn. A few quick rounds in London to get started, and you're off. Each level varies in complexity, challenging issues & equipment. Melbourne for example features same-speed trams that cross your map slowly. Whereas Osaka has high-speed rail links to work with. And Cairo's short car subways fill up quickly. Part of what makes this game so great is the straightforward graphics. No frills. No gimmicks. No flashy BS to showcase a programmer's tiny little....ego. It's brilliant as it has less - and it works by being so much more. Highly addictive. Highly recommended. And possibly in my top 5 games played of all time. (And I go back to the 1980s, kids...)			"

												A fun if somewhat frustrating game, I've done a couple of the maps so far and look forward to checking out the others and progressing in my ability to play the game as I go on.It appears to be quite simple but actually gets quite difficult as you constantly redraw routes and balance your trains and cabs available on each line to prevent a big queue at the stations.

								This game is ridiculously addictive.  It's a pretty simple concept.  You're creating a subway to get passangers of various shapes to their correspondingly shaped stops.  You have various train lines and a certain number of tunnels you can construct.  At the end of each week you get an additional train and one of a few options (extra carriage, extra line, extra tunnels). The actual gameplay is hypnotic.  As you work to make your lines work as efficiently as possible, more stops pop up. Your trains go back and forth or around in a circle on your track and it's simultaneously engaging and rather cathartic to see all the little passangers getting where they're going.  I can't wait to see what comes up in future updates.			"

												I absolutely love Mini Metro! I've played it since before it was even on Steam. Anyways, the one thing I have always been wishing to see in every update was a Los Angeles map. LA has an every expanding system, with more than 100 miles of Light Rail and Heavy Rail transit. I can also confidently say that if Los Angeles were added to the game, a lot of people I personally know, as well as so many more people would become interested in buying Mini Metro for that reason. I mean, have you seen all the fictional Los Angeles transportation maps countless people have made over the decades? Well, if you haven't, believe me when I say that the ones on Google Images are only the tip of the iceburg. I really do feel Los Angeles is worthy of a spot in Mini Metro for these reasons, and I really do hope adding the city is seriously considered, because countless people would seriously love to see that happen. Thank you for your consideration!			"

												Mini Metro is a really fun casual game that is addictive and actually quite challenging. It's also fun to see the silhouettes of various cities and to try to build you own ""metro"" in those cities.			"

Early Access Review
								Mini Metro is that game that I've wanted to play since gradeschool when I doodled city maps and mass transit systems in my notebook margins.  I am utterly hooked on the early access release, and I'm very excited by the prospect of more maps and game modes.  Maxis regrettably stripped trains and subways (a.k.a. the fun parts) out of the Sim City franchise, and Dinosaur Polo Club has concentrated them in this addictive and stylish game.  I highly recommend this to everyone.			"

												This game is pretty much everything I hoped it would be, from the screenshots. Its beautiful in its simplicity, yet challenging enough to be interestingI really wish it presented you with your best personal scores when you end a level and also notified you when you beat your previous high score. Right now you are left to figure it all out manually, with no notification			"

												This is probably my favorite game of 2015. It's minimalist but deep, with plenty of room for you as a player to explore a zillion different play styles. It's chill, with an amazing adaptive soundtrack where everything that happens IS THE MUSIC (thank you Disasterpeace), but that doesn't stop it from building up some serious pressure after a while.The game's biggest flaw is that it's not on my iPad. The developers are working on fixing that problem, though, and in the meantime I'm not sorry that this means I'll be buying the game a second time.If you like management or sim games at all, grab it. Or wait for the tablet version, but then grab that one.

			While I wouldn't say that Mini Metro is objectively the best game of 2015, it is my personal favorite. Let's talk about what makes this train system management sim excellent.		

Below is my original early access review.---This game is already a fairly solid simulation game with fun core gameplay. I can't wait to see how much it improves before the full release.			"

												I got this game through my brother telling me about it while it was still in early access, like, REALLY early access, like, so early there wasnt even any music early. And I gotta say, it's only improved scince then, the simplistic graphics make it easy to focus on everything. I highly recommend this game,  and as of this review, a mobile adaptation has recently been released. so you can play on the go! Overall, the game is fun and worth your money.			"

												It's a thematic puzzle game with minimalist visuals and simple mechanics!The theme? Misery.You see, if you play Mini Metro only aiming to reach the minimum goal for each city then it's okay enough. Fairly short but the challenge is reasonable. Overall, it's passable.The problem lies in trying to push the game any further.Mini Metro relies mainly on RNG to keep itself fresh. Map layout for each city is always the same but starting points, station placement and resource availability are randomised. Being a puzzle game, that would require very careful balance so the player has sufficient tools to keep stations from overcrowding (the game's fail state) at least most of the time.Unfortunately, that's not the case here. Games start fairly slow with a steady increase in activity for a short while, before cranking the difficulty up to eleven absurdly fast with stations popping up far away on the edges of the map, population increasing like nasty cancerous cells and don't even get me started on those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ same-type station clusters always forming WITHOUT FAIL.Resources to deal with all the junk being thrown at once? You only get to pick one at the end of each week and the selection is limited and also randomised, which is clearly one of the biggest flaws here, since there's no reason to lock the player out of vital options in a puzzle game, especially when urgency becomes a constant after just a few minutes and they might desperately need those bridges to save an urban planning career from an early catastrophe but WHO CARES IT'S JUST WATER HERE HAVE ANOTHER LINE.For three weeks straight.You could try exploiting the fact that you can change the routes and replace the trains as much as you want (it's not a simulator in the slightest, after all) but, really, having to do that every 3 seconds to prolong the inevitable for maybe another week at best just makes the whole thing a chore to play and you'll end up looking even more pathetically desperate.Unless this game gets some much-needed rebalancing, it's not really worth it. Until then, for anyone looking for a challenging and fair puzzle game, Mini Metro is most definitely going to look like one big RNG train wreck.Yes. I'm so clever.			"

												Such a simple concept, and yet so much fun!  The graphics are absolute basic, almost comical, but that does not take away from the gameplay.  The interface is very intuitive, and I found myself playing immediately without even bothering to look up anything about how to play.  This game is relaxing, yet challenging.  You'll soon be trapped by the ""next time I'll do it so much better"" feeling, and before you know it you've been playing for an hour...Your goal is to connect the metro stations together.  New stations pop up at random on the map, and you decide whether to extend an existing train line to service that new station or to create a new line.  You can add extra trains, extra cars, and even extra-fast trains to your lines as the game progresses.  Use your tunnels and bridges sparingly, because you only have so many to work with.  Also, the total number of train lines, engines, and carriage cars are also limited, but you can choose which items you want more of at the end of each simulated week in the game.  When people have to wait too long at a station to catch a train, the game is over.  Simple, right?  Ha!  If only...After you've played a few rounds you begin to think like a traffic engineer.  How can I best eliminate this bottle-neck?  Should I add another line to short-cut between these two large hubs?  Or maybe just add another train to the line?  What about making a loop?  You find yourself trying all sorts of different ideas, and cursing yourself when a new station pops up across the river and you don't have any bridges or tunnels left because you foolishly squandered them early on to make an inner-city loop!Mini Metro has a calm, relaxed atmosphere, and it reminds me a bit of the original Railroad Tycoon, but in this game there is no real economy.  There's nothing to buy, and the supply of track is unlimited.  Your only real adversary is time.  You need to keep the people moving, and the trains only go so fast...  An average game lasts about 10 minutes.Tons of fun, especialy for such a simple concept.  If you liked Sim City or Railroad Tycoon, chances are good that you'll love this game.  And at only 10 bucks, it's pretty cheap too.			"

												This game is so stunningly simple and yet so complex with just the right amount of difficulty. So glad I took a chance on this game. Feeling like you're redesigning the major metros/subway systems of the world was cool, relatable, and satisfying. I hope more cities are added in the future.. Especially Chicago and Toronto- I thought the EL would've been a no-brainer. That being said, this game has high replayability. You always want to top your best score and that's difficult for a game to accomplish. Solid 8.5/10 from me. This was an absolute STEAL on the steam sale- it almost feels criminal. ALMOST.			"

												The most minimalistic strategy game I've ever played. But quite interesting and addictive.Connecting stations using metro lines might seem an easy challenge but the mechanics and restrictions of this game make it quite challenging and will keep you entertained for hours.The only downside is that the minimalistic design neglects to teach you the game or the interface, so check YouTube or Steam guides for hints.

												I never write reviews, so that should be some indication of how much I enjoy and respect this game and it's dev.  It's an addictive real-time simulation of the Travelling Salesman problem, combined with a bunch of probability statistics, and with a graphical interface that is a work of simplistic beauty.  Oh, and did I mention the music/sounds?  They're pretty much one and the same, and I honestly think one of the more under-rated parts of this game.  It's literally as if the trains were generating the music.I've only had this game a few weeks, but have already racked up dozens of hours of play.  And I'd also like to say that from what I can tell, the dev is an upstanding, modest person who takes pride in making a good product at a fair price, listens attentively to users, and even appears to offer excellent customer support (he mentioned that the new build of the game won't run on an older Mac OS version, and offered refunds to anyone who wanted one if they were affected.  Whoever you are, you're a class act, mate.Oh, and as a Cities Skylines fan, I can say that Mini Metro has made me a LOT better at designing roads, bus routes, and railways.  So if you want to improve your C:S skills, this game is totally worth it just for that reason.			"

												I ask myself, Why didn't I make this game?As simple as it may seem. YOUR WRONG. It is not simple at all and it really puts a different view in my mind about the people who made our train systems. The people who have to deal with us by working at that train stations, out in view and behind the sence. You have to think is it better to have one main place for everyone to be transfering like Penn Station on the north east side of the USA. Should it flow different like the BART system on the west coast of the USA. Sadly, it is not one or the other. Some place make changes all the time to better time and get more people around where they need to be.You could start off simple with one line or just keep it three lines but you may find yourself finding the people getting upset and the game ends quickly. A lot of pressure or maybe it is no pressure at all if you like puzzles and strategy. With this game you will have to keep changing your strategies through the game or maybe just in the beginning depending on how you read the game. Even how your draw the line between spots has strategy all on its own.I do enjoy this game. It is very relaxing to my engineer mindset which doesn't seem to turn off, this game makes it slow down. The music is calming as well. Personally, I am not sure if they change the music through out each different stations, but never the less, it does keep me calm. Plus it is so simple to learn how to draw between stations, my mother who hasn't toucch a computer since they did punch cards for programming, can understand it and enjoy it as well or help me play along.

												Mini MetroFirst of all I have to admit that I think this game is presented in a very appealing style. As an architect it is my day to day job to think about graphical appearances of drawings and diagrams so I see myself capable to state that the art and graphic style of the game is phenomenal. The greatness of the presenation starts with the use of pictogram's and symbols, includes great color management and concludes in a nearly flawless minimal design game.The game is a great ""time killer"" for optimizing fanatics because fully understanding the game takes quiet a while in my opinion as it is not a as straight forward game as it looks like in the beginning. Its not mastered by thinking ""I am going to connect these stations and lets see what happens!"". A situation which shows that there is more effort put into the design of the game than in a strait forward browser games. The game also has great balancing as each factor is important but no game factor has a ridiculous overwhelmingly impact. For example the drawing style of each player is different and the game sometimes draws the metro lines so that he trains actually lose some time on each station. If the player redraws and tries to put the lines in the right angel he achieves a optimization of some milli second. A factor that helps the player to make a better score but it is also possible to make good scores by concentrating on other ""small factors"" like the one just explained.Finally I have to also state that the game has an factor of addiction as the player always things ""one more time, this time I'm going to make a score over 2.000"". A situation (which again) shows very good inventing, designing and balancing potential by the developers of the game. So putting all together this game is totally worth its money as the player will play for a throughout great design and thought through little puzzle game.http://architectonreview.blogspot.com.tr/ "

												A very addicting game. The game is balanced on Chance.The station that spawn are at random location and at random shapes, you can't create a perfect line to accomodate the ever growing stations. Some say it is part of the challenge, I say it limits the fun factor a bit.You also have limited control on your weekly upgrades, you only have two choices from four, the game is not smart enough to give you a choice that matters because it is also random. I don't understand why the player can't choose from the four upgrades since it is a vital part of the game. Often times you are at the mercy of the game to give you the upgrades you really need.This game is also rage inducing.I will recommend this game though, even if its random half of the time it is still fun to play.Which reminds me, I mostly said bad things about the game.

												Very nice little optimization puzzle game. The screenshots alone don't really do it justice. Each level starts off easy but then gets gradually harder when more and more stations pop up and passengers start to appear in a quicker pace. After each in-game week you get to pick one of two perks, such as tunnels or a new locomotive. These choices are interesting, there's no right answer that works all the time. The game also forces you to make interesting choices all the time in the name of optimization. Shorten that crowded line, but make another one longer? Add a carriage here or a locomotive there? Recommended, especially right now when you can get it in the Humble Eye Candy Bundle along with some other nice games. :)			"

Early Access Review
								Mini Metro, a strategy game by Dinosaur Polo Club that is so simple yet so fun, you’d think that they actually made a game equivalent to Sudoku.The game revolves around you, a bunch of shapes that resemble stations, train lines and customers that look like shapes. You have to connect all the stations together and get all the passengers to where they want to be without the stations getting crowded. The maps slowly expand revealing more play area to which more stations open up for you to connect to. You can make numerous train lines or add more trains and carriages to existing lines to help transporting passengers.There are numerous levels to play on, each with rivers where you have to make tunnels through, despite the limited supply. You get a train given to you every week and a choice of an extra tunnel, carriage or train line to get to help you win. Even though it looks easy, it isn’t really. They added an extra mode which is the equivalent of a sandbox mode, where the stations can get full of passengers but the game doesn’t end, this allows you to just build and deliver passengers as you please, while still working with the limited supplies. They plan on making another mode which will be hard-core, only for experienced players, more cities, customers but maybe less or normal amount of assets.Mini Metro is In Early Access currently (time of review posting) and therefore isn’t finished, a simple game with lots to do. Despite the lack of music, there are big plans for the future and it’s exciting to imagine what comes next. The game comes with the ability to change between colour-blind mode and not colour-blind mode, meaning that players who have trouble with colours can still play the game. There is even a Day and Night mode that changes the colour of the game, white for day and black for night so it doesn’t hurt your eyes. These two features aren’t given often in games but should be added for those who need these options.This game, despite its easy looks it is quite hard, and that’s something you don’t see much anymore, hard games that look easy. Dinosaur Polo Club have developed a game that is really fun and challenging, something that strategy game lovers need in their steam library.I rate this game a 9/10. Not a 10 because of the lack of features, but since it’s an Early Access game, a couple more updates and it’ll be a 10/10.			"

								Don´t expect this game to be about finances as I did but read the description to the end. But if you like to play games which are designed to have you failing, where you have to look for better and better tactics, then you´ll have your great fun with it. Ultra-intuitive, not even a tutorial is needed. Smooth performance (if this is even worth mentioning for this kind of game) and well-looking surface. A bit expensive in my opinion but a good game nevertheless.			"

								It's very easy to say that Mini Metro is my newest addiction. After traveling to various cities and experiencing multiple transit lines, it's fun to be in the commanding seat to map out where everything goes. Having familarity with the cities is a huge plus when playing the game, and adds an extra level of amusement. The design of the game is so simple, pretty and just amazing to stare at. My favorite part has to be when you get a huge city going with dozens of stops, multiple color lines, and trains, it's just great to see all the colors moving around. The city never stops moving.

												The first thing you notice in Mini Metro is the clean aesthetic. The minimalist graphics are both pleasing to the eyes and reminiscing of the many subway maps we have around the world. That graphical happiness is soon followed by the pleasure of drawing the metro lines, in a very intuitive way. But then come the passengers...after a few minutes things start to become hectic and you're scrambling around trying to fix your network that is inevitably doomed. And then, you want to try it again to do better.But after theses first few games, you will begin to notice a pattern...the first few minutes of the game are boring. Setting up a basic network is easy for anyone with a few games under their belt. Even on fast forward, it still feels too slow...until it doesn't, and suddenly you notice your network has congestion all over the place. You fix things here and there, but usually once congestion start to set in, it will just go downhill. And now you notice the main problem of the game: pacing.Pacing in Mini Metro is weird. Things are usually either too slow, or too fast. The sweet spot, where you have to fix stuff but you still have time to think and do things coherently, is such a small part of each game. The endless mode offers some of the pleasure of doing things at your own pace, but it encourages a playstyle that is dumb (serving the minimum numbers of station, leaving 2/3 of the map unconnected).Another big drawback of the game is the randomness. Stations spawn completely randomly, and an important station spawning at the wrong time or the wrong place can utterly destroy a game that was going well. On the other hand, you can sometime be saved by stations popping up exactly where you need them. This randomness is both frustrating, and greatly limit the strategic aspect of the game. It's hard to know how well or how bad you're doing when things vary so much from game to game. Therefore, it's even harder to learn to play the game properly. Expert modes, challenges, or simply highscore chases can become very frustrating when you get bad stations spawns.All of that makes Mini Metro a tough game to evaluate. It's original, it had a good idea and great visual, but the minute-to-minute gameplay isn't quite there. I wish Steam would let me gives a ""neutral thumb"", but since i have to choose between a ""up thumb"" or a ""down thumb"", I'm gonna go with a ""play the free flash prototype for a few minutes, but skip this full game version"".PS: if you do play the full game, I recommend you cut all sounds (there is no option to cut only certain sounds), because the awful music they've added doesn't improve the game, and actually gave me headaches. I recommend playing with your own music as a background, even if that mean you don't get the important ""overcrowding station warnings"".			"

												It's fun, it's relaxing... and it's not worth the asking price.My biggest gripes with the game is that as a strategy-puzzle game, I don't feel like I got better at the game when playing it. I don't feel like I discovered a more efficient strategy or anything. Like, is a looping rail way better than a non looping one? Is a station with many lines connecting to it a good thing or not? Is having passengers transfer via many station a good or a bad thing? The game just doesn't offer any feedback to my strategy.And God, I hate the random system so much. On one playthrough I didn't get any additional bridge at all, so I have to minimize the amount of bridge needed. On the next playthrough I got so many bridges, making everything I learn before useless =/			"

								Mini Metro is a puzzle game about stringing up as many different shaped stations in a line as possible. The challenge comes from the imbalance and numerousness of the spawned shapes, and your task is to figure out the logistics of shipping any cargo to its desired type of destination as efficiently as possible, without overflowing its spawn station, or any interchange stations on the way. The art style will be familiar to anyone who uses their local metro system, however unfortunately this game is not a simulator by any means. If you want to build any metro line in a way that vaguely resembles reality, you will lose and you will lose hard. The screenshots you see are only representative of the first 5 minutes of the game, they are not representative of anything you might end up with - There will never be enough lines or trains supplied to allow you to create anything orderly - your trains will weave around the map, twisting and turning to gobble up all un-connected stations like a nokia snake. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants an interesting puzzle in a metro theme. However I have to downvote it because the description is misleading - If you're looking for a subway management simulator, look elsewhere.			"

								Clever little addictive strategy game that is deceptively simple and visually appealing. Using global metro/underground/railway maps as the motif, you'll try repeatedly to shuffle passengers around to their correct stops (based on shapes) as you juggle line layout, variety of shapes, and number of locomotive and engine cars to move them. At the moment, there is only one game mode, limited tutorial, and no sound, but if you like strategy games -- even fairly casual ones -- there is enough to keep you busy for quite awhile already at this Early Access state.

Mini Metro is a game of make-believe mass transit.Hear me out.Mini Metro allows you to build a subway system in imitation of the systems of major world cities.  The stations you must link up appear randomly within an area, and each station has a different shape.  ""Passengers"" are represented by smaller shapes.  Triangles need to go to triangle stations, and so forth.  You start with a few lines and you can connect your stations -your passengers can make transfers- and work around the waterways of the city.  You have trains (needed to make your lines work), carriages (boosting the capacity of packed trains) and tunnels/bridges (to work around the water).Mini Metro starts with London and Paris, and the other cities unlock, one by one, by transporting enough passengers on the city before it.  New cities bring new challenges and new resources. Mini Metro allows for brief play sessions.  I'm not particularly good at this game, so it's usually Game Over after about 20 minutes of play, which allows me to get up and do other things, rather than getting sucked in.  I'm getting better, I swear!If you played SimCity and want a briefer experience, or played Roller Coaster Tycoon and wanted something more... grounded... you should play Mini Metro.  I strongly recommend it, even at full price.  It's fun, and pleasing, but it is not exciting.  City planning rarely is.I bought this game for full price, I became interested in it after seeing it mentioned in one of the ""Games You May Not Have Tried"" episodes of Extra Credits.			"

												Don't get caught offguard by the graphics. Despite looking fairly simplistic, there's quite some depth to the game and the different maps. You constantly have to make strategic decisions based on the amount of bridges, lines and wagons you own to keep the stations from overflowing. On top of that, changes in acceleration and speed between the various trains and metro's make each map feel distinct.Eventhough you will eventually get overwhelmed, the pace and simplistic graphics of Mini Metro make it a perfect last game before bedtime. It's very satisfying to see your network expand while the numbers get higher.			"

												If you like the adrenaline rushes that accompany micromanagement, this game is for you. As the one overseeing the construction of your metro, you are expected to strategize and be able to adapt to sudden and often unwanted changes in an attempt to move passengers from point A to point B.Picture this: you have a beautiful, stable system with no overflowing stations. You sit back, sporting a grin of pride on your face, until suddenly, one of your stations has changed and a new station has appeared on one of your tracks to ruin your delivery efficiency. As you scramble to tweak your lines, an army of circle stations all appear on one side of the map. And even with an entire line now devoted to these stations, you begin to experience multiple overflows. This unavoidable stress and the knowledge you gain from learning how to better construct your railways are the alluring charms that make this game so replayable.However, don't be discouraged by the inevitable-  the moment when a handful of people at an overflowing train station all collectively write enough bad Yelp reviews to put you out of business.

 Game is still in Development.  But you can see where its going. The Game is solid, if you like games like Civ, Anno and other construction / management games you should take a look. But don't get me wrong. This game is only about building a Subway System on a map, not about ruling and expanding your Empire. The stations will spawn randomly and you have to manage your resources (trains, tunnels, wagons) carefully. There is / isn't much time to improve your Metro sytem. Easy to learn hard to master :) A little bit of luck is needed to fight for the highscore.			"

								Clever little addictive strategy game that is deceptively simple and visually appealing. Using global metro/underground/railway maps as the motif, you'll try repeatedly to shuffle passengers around to their correct stops (based on shapes) as you juggle line layout, variety of shapes, and number of locomotive and engine cars to move them. At the moment, there is only one game mode, limited tutorial, and no sound, but if you like strategy games -- even fairly casual ones -- there is enough to keep you busy for quite awhile already at this Early Access state.

								Mini Metro distills logic and joy of multi-day train-route management games into a free-form art that can be enjoyed in 30 minutes.  Rather than work through tables of numbers or try to optimize the profitability of lines like a traditional train game, Mini Metro offers a lighter fair that encompasses the same core aesthetic without the complexity.  Suprising depth for a simple interface.I normally hold Early Access Games in contempt, as they are making a promise about a future game that they rarely deliver on.  Mini Metro's gameplay is functionally complete (aside from a sound to accompany the visual warning that a station is backing up).  I wouldn't care less if they didn't update another thing.			"

												I bought Mini Metro when it was in Early Access for the first two or three months. I loved it, but there was a lot missing, which was expected for such an early version of the game. I forgot about for a long time, and when I remembered how the game was fun, I decided to check it out, since it was officially released. The game is great! It's pretty casual, the sounds are great (and I personally love how each new line has it's own sounds), and there are almost no problems, the only one I've encountered in 3.8 hours of game was that the sound glitched and turned into a one-tone buzz that was only fixed by restarting the game. I definitely recommend this if you appreciate casual strategy games.			"

												This is a nice and simple puzzle game that makes you connect 'stations' of various shapes with other 'stations' in order to use 'trams' to transport shapes to their corresponding station. The reason I put stations and trams in citation marks is because I think the theme of the game could easily be something else entirely. However does it matter that the theme is not the strongest? Not at all. Mini Metro is not a game that requires a lot of theme. It is a fun little puzzle game that gets harder as you progress and as you create more and more elaborate lines. I really enjoy how easy the game is to understand without the need of a text heavy tutorial. I like that the game maintains simplicity in design while adding complexity in the options the player will have to solve each puzzle. You can arrange and rearrange your lines as much as you like and you can deploy and redeploy trams and carriages at your convenience. So wherein lies the challenge? Well, to me, the challenge comes from a limited set of lines and trams available combined with a growing number of stations and passengers. A line that I might have had no problems with before, suddenly becomes overcrowded and I have to rearrange my lines or trams in order to deal with the situation before it is too late.Obviously, as the game is so simple and minimalistic, it is not something that I have played, or even see myself playing for hours on end. But I rather enjoy bringing it out when I have to kill a quarter of an hour or something along those lines. The puzzles change every time so I don’t feel like I’ve exhausted any of the cities in the game yet and in fact, some of the cities have now become a race against my own previous achievements. The game also has a nice tranquil feeling to the design to the point where it can feel both stressful to decide where to place the next line or which tram to give an extra carriage, as well as calming to watch the gentle movement on the pure white background.All in all, a good game worth a look if you’re into puzzle games.

												Mini Metro is by far one of my favourite games. You're given the challenge of building a metro system that successfully links people to the destinations of their choices without overwhelming the network or resulting in waiting too long at any one station. It's remarkably zen but also remarkably challenging... and I can't help but love to play this game! I particularly love the daily challenges which provide their own constraints but which can only be attempted once.			"

								For me this game is totally awesome! Why?Because in this game, you can explore the idea of creating subway lines, focus on the networks between each location. The challenge is, every few minutes, new location comes and ask for you to build the lane to that location. And every few minutes, you also get a new train (which you can use in your current subway lines or use it later if you got a new line), option between new line, new carriage (so your train will be able to load more people), new tunnel (because at some points in the map, you need tunnel to draw the line if there is a river on the top of it), and also intersection to make a location can be reach by more line (usually a place limit is 2 line in one location).You can edit your current line anytime, and to make you more focus, you can even pause the game, draw it, then continue the game.If you are people who are happy to be challenged, you will like this game!And also, the size of the game is friendly for people with low internet quota heheThank you and let's play!

								This is a game that makes you happy to quit in furstration. While early access the game is very playable as it currently stands. You build a subway and if you make it through a week without overcrowding any station you get another locomotive and a choice of upgrade from between two items. You usually really need both and it makes it hard to pick.Somewhere in week five you have a jump in diffcultly where you have to scramble to keep everything going. I save a carriage and a locomotive just for that hump. You keep growing and growing until you have a station overcrowd and you fail. I can usually go four or five games before I get furstrated with failing. I've played hours on the beta version before they came to early access. I was happy to play until I quit in furstration and come back to try again later.There is supposed to be a zen mode coming. When that hits I'll be playing lots more.The delevopers are very good about feedback. I mentioned my family needed a colorblind mode and they were very good about asking what would make it easier for us. I've seen where things I've suggested (that I'm sure others suggested too) have been implemented already. This is early access done right. When it gets closer to finished I'll be buying this for a friend if they haven't given in and gotten it by then. And that's the best recommandation I can give a game.			"

But I rather enjoy bringing it out when I have to kill a quarter of an hour or something along those lines. The puzzles change every time so I don’t feel like I’ve exhausted any of the cities in the game yet and in fact, some of the cities have now become a race against my own previous achievements. The game also has a nice tranquil feeling to the design to the point where it can feel both stressful to decide where to place the next line or which tram to give an extra carriage, as well as calming to watch the gentle movement on the pure white background.All in all, a good game worth a look if you’re into puzzle games.

												A very enjoyable, minimlist, puzzle game with a great aesthetic. The game offers a very fair gradient for gradually increasing the challenge while offering its players plenty of variety. With daily challenges, a nice selection of maps, and some very challenging achievements, this game provides lots of entertainment for the cost. "

												This is a puzzle game I sincerely enjoyed. The mechanics of the game offer a depth which takes a long time to master, but is really easy to get into. The game uses minimalistic aesthetics which work really well, it doesn't overwhelm you with information but it still gives you everything you need to know to have an enjoyable experience.			"

It also can happen that you play this game a few hours in a row. Their is no soundtrack or soundeffects yet, but this lack of sound can be compensated by playing your own music in the background.So everyone who likes to play a strategic game, that's relaxing and fun, Mini Metro is your game.

								Mini Metro is a zen puzzle game with simple yet addictive gameplay that keeps players interested for hours. I had the good fortune of stumbling over Mini Metro whilst reading about one of the Ludum Dare competitions (26 I believe); the game is a successor to 'Mind the Gap' a game of a similar premise.The simple design and user interface will no doubt sit well with players, although I do wonder why there was a shift from the old in game menu which in many ways--was simpler--a simple flick to the left of the screen would bring it up. The actual gameplay is very good. Your objective is to maintain your underground system for as long as possible without too much overcrowding. If a station incurs too much congestion for more than thirty seconds, game over.I cannot be certain as the game is still in pre-release, but there seems to have been some nerfing of gameplay in the form of bonuses you acquire at the end of the week. You now gain a new train every Sunday but there seems to be a lack of station upgrades. One of the things I was expecting was more choice, rather than less.Some features are currently unavailable but in the works; maps and music come to mind. I'm looking forward to seeing those implemented over time. I caution Dinosaur Polo Club about adding new maps as DLC though (I still see a fairly lackluster amount of additional maps to be unlocked as the game is updated), and I hope we as players are buying the full game, rather than half of it!One last point of contention is the game's varied art style. Some maps are very minimalist such as London and Paris, with a plain white background. Others, such as Cairo and New York are yellower and although this is a very very small point, I can't tell if this inconsistency is good or bad yet.Over all Mini Metro is a solid game, especially for the price, well worth picking up!8.5/10			"

								Mini Metro is a minimalistic optimization game where you are presented with various symbols representing metro stations with commuters represented by smaller symbols. Your job? Connect the station with coloured lines representing metro lines,  allowing metro trains represented by rectangles to transport the commuters to their desired destination. You lose when too many passengers are waiting on a station. And that's it!The art style and the soundtrack are minimalistic and very clear: the game uses bright colours and clear shapes so you can clearly see the current situation. Meanwhile, each event produces a sound: communers appearing make a *plop* sound, each train plays a section of a sound file when travelling, and a ticking noise is heard when too many passengers are waiting. I was pleasantly surprised that this didn't make a cacophony, but a pleasant almost melodious arrangement of seemingly random sounds. It is very relaxing, and now you don't only see that you made a good working metro network, but you can hear it too!The difficulty lies of course not in solving the puzzle, but in optimizing it. Everyone can make a good functioning metro system, but creating a well optimized network requires clever thinking combined with trial and error. You can compare your scores to that of the world and friends, giving you the motivation to perform better. This game is easy to learn, but hard to master.Tl;dr: Optimize a metro system, represented by minimalistic vectors and melodious sound effects. Buy it now, because a price increase is coming soon!

								As of today, sept. 4th, 2015, Mini Metro is still in development. But it's already a fully playable (and enjoyable) game.Mini Metro is a minimalist game, in the sense that:- the goal is simple (keep your metro network working as fluidly as possible)- the gameplay elements are simple (as time goes on, you gain more lines, train, tunnel...)- the ergonomics are simple (draw a line between two stations and you've built a new metro line ; click and drop a train on a line and it'll immediately work on its own schedule)- the look is simple (as you can see, the visuals are inspired by subway maps you can find all around the world)But a minimalist game isn't a simple game. Each station has a specific shape. Imagine that a circle represents a residential district and that a triangle represents a business area. Passengers will then tend to go from a circle to triangle. And back. But as time goes, new shapes appear. And it really feels like if a city was blooming before your eyes. Again, imagine that a square is a commercial district, a star is a tourist area,  a diamond is an airport... Some of the shapes will appear in large numbers and close together. Others will be scarce but will be a favorite destination from all around the map. Again, just like in a real blooming city.Add to that the fact that a dozen of real life cites are present in the game, each with a different feel, different tools, different obstacles.To put it simply, the game is already perfect as it is. But it's still quite hard to explain and you really have to experience how it works, for it's both a very stressing and demanding game and a most contemplative and artistic pice of work.			"

												Mini Metro is a casual strategy game with a minimalist aesthetic. You play as a train system designer connecting stations together in the most efficient way possible, but new stations and more passangers use your system over time. The difficulty of this game ramps up so nicely, starting as a slow, casual connect-the-dot style game with relaxing music to a fast-paced strategy game where you'll be thinking about how to restructure a metro system without interrupting the current flow to minimize use of distance, interchanges, and bridges. All in the span of about 20 to 30 minutes.			"

												Bought this game because I loved its design and simplicity, and it turned out to be a lot more addicting that I expected. It's a game all about optimization. If you're looking for a light puzzle game you can relax to after a long day, this is perfect for you. I love how short and sweet each game is - typically around 15 minutes or so. However, if you are looking for something that will really challenge your thinking abilities until your brain hurts, this is probably not the game for you. In Mini Metro, you won't ever really have an ""Aha!"" moment that a lot of puzzle game provides because there is no definite end goal or solution. You just keep on optimizing until the city's population overwhelms your metro system.			"

Early Access Review
								As of today, sept. 4th, 2015, Mini Metro is still in development. But it's already a fully playable (and enjoyable) game.Mini Metro is a minimalist game, in the sense that:- the goal is simple (keep your metro network working as fluidly as possible)- the gameplay elements are simple (as time goes on, you gain more lines, train, tunnel...)- the ergonomics are simple (draw a line between two stations and you've built a new metro line ; click and drop a train on a line and it'll immediately work on its own schedule)- the look is simple (as you can see, the visuals are inspired by subway maps you can find all around the world)But a minimalist game isn't a simple game. Each station has a specific shape. Imagine that a circle represents a residential district and that a triangle represents a business area. Passengers will then tend to go from a circle to triangle. And back. But as time goes, new shapes appear. And it really feels like if a city was blooming before your eyes. Again, imagine that a square is a commercial district, a star is a tourist area,  a diamond is an airport... Some of the shapes will appear in large numbers and close together. Others will be scarce but will be a favorite destination from all around the map. Again, just like in a real blooming city.Add to that the fact that a dozen of real life cites are present in the game, each with a different feel, different tools, different obstacles.To put it simply, the game is already perfect as it is. But it's still quite hard to explain and you really have to experience how it works, for it's both a very stressing and demanding game and a most contemplative and artistic pice of work.			"

Sure it may only be 30-ish MB, but it is one of those games that does more with less. Mini Metro is fantastic!			"

												A puzzle game where you have to keep passengers moving on a series of subway lines. It is simple to learn, with a minimalist design, but the levels get hectic rather fast. There is also a rather nasty random element to the game. You can get a cluster of the same type of stations and that will make it really hard to do well. That’s a pain, but overall the game is still worth buying.			"

Very easy to pick up and put down, and it is very fun. Love the endless mode you can get when you lose.

												I have always been fascinated with simulations of real life things. As a kid, I dug SimTower trying to build the greatest skyscraper everrrrr (unfortunately, it took a lot of micromanaging so I got bored after I hit 4 stars). With Mini Metro, I lay my hands on a very simplistic type of simulation: You have to connect different spots on the map (which is based on real life cities) in order to build a functioning public transportation system. Starting out slowly, you soon hit the point where your passengers get annoyed and complain because they have to wait too long (it's not like nobody has ever been in that state of mind). It takes careful planning and managing your lines to be successful until the inevitable overcrowded station. Different cities also have different assets to their system such as high-speed trains or interchanges that don't overcrowd as fast. It is a lot of fun on the way there and adds some variation by the Daily Challenge as well as a sandbox-like endless mode. I enjoy playing it whenever I am sick of the fast-paced multiplayer games I usually play.			"

								If you like the bold lines and abstract shapes of the Harry Beck-style transit map, then this is your chance to dive into one up to your armpits. It is simple to get to grips with but incredibly complex to learn, because you're dealing with an NP complete problem that keeps evolving as you play. It's laid back and relaxed but frenetic at the same time, because who knows when you'll have to redraw your entire network all of a sudden and it will test you to the limit. This game is already one of my top five all-time favourites, because until I played it I had no idea just how long I'd been waiting for it.At it's core Mini Metro is a strategy game, but not in the sense of combat, but in one of motion, logistics. Balancing the economics of time, distance and people in simple lines and abstract geometric shapes. It's easy to get into but so difficult to master, combined with the random nature of the gameplay, that gives it an incredible amount of longevity.Buy it. Buy it for a friend. Buy it for a family member. Buy it for a co-worker. Play it. Enjoy it. Love it. It's well worth the asking price.			"

												I'll thumbs this one up for being both original and simple. This game is a schoolbook example of elegance in abstract design: here's a map, shaped points (stations) are going to crop up and will slowly get filled up by small shapes (passengers) that need to get to one of the other shapes, and here are a couple routes you can draw as you want. Keep the stations from becoming overcrowded as long as possible.As you can guess, going about this is growing slowly more complex with every added station. To which route will you add this? Will you make a detour or redesign things? How will the extra travel time affect the waiting times? And will the resulting choice make sure that the route passes through enough different shapes to make sure everyone actually gets on the train?Sorry...I'm getting off-topic, but for good reason: the graphics are as simple as can be, the music is relaxing but has or needs (pretty much?) no sounds and controls are just left-mouse buttons. What's there to talk about? (okay, the controls sometimes need some getting used to, but still...). Perhaps that I sort of expected this to be a (very good quality) mobile game as well, but mobile users won't be able (yet) to play this game about building a commute system. :PAt this point, I feel like I've both gotten a good idea what the game is about and not having an idea how to PROPERLY play the game at all.

												TL;DR 10/10 addictive and very challengingThis game is absolutely amazing. At first it looked like a very easy game with extremely easy control, but soon it turns into some extreme mind-boggling puzzle requiring real time strategy.- GameplayAs time goes on, new stops are built and you need to connect them in such a way that passengers can move conveniently without overcrowding on the stops. Per week you get new resources, such as the ability to construct a new line, getting additional locomotives or wagons, tunnels, bridges etc., being a finite resource. The only infinit thing is the way and length of the tracks. The amount of passengers increases and stops keep appearing at random locations and you need to find the most efficient way to get them from A to B. The passengers and stops are somewhat marked to where they desire to go and what the stops look like, but it's very abstract and it's there to give you just a basic idea.- The game itselfThe game is designed according to a very abstract concept. It looks as clean as it could be and is really all you need. The sounds are also somewhat pleasing, you can turn it off if you wish though.- ConclusionIt's a fun and challenging game to play after a hard day of work and what seems like a relaxing game, turns into a very complex puzzle and requires you to pay attention all the time and sometimes even to pauze and fundamentally redesign your network. Yet, it stays fun and you are free to do what you want.			"

												Mini Metro is a pleasant ambient experience of spinning plates. Plates that are trains, and the poles are also trains. So are your hands, they're also trains.Pleasant plinks and plonks are what transpire as you connect sporadically spawning train stations to your colourful lines and it's all very calming. It's a simple affair of sending triangles to their triangular getaways and the squares to their loser square stations and you can just begin to feel your heartrate slow and your muscles relax and you've finally found a way to calm down after a long day's of work that doesn't invovle rampant alcoholism.Suddenly stations keep spawning. Your stations keep getting busier. You're plagued by circular stations, filling your trains with♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥wanting to go anywhere BUT the 5 circular stations that await them along the next stretch of your blue line. Stations are filling rapidly. Your trains can't cope! Panic sets in! Maybe if you move a carriage to a train on a different line?OH NO! It was too late, the full train has already passed the rapidly over crowding station, making this extra carriage nothing more than a large metallic bauble. Your perfect distribution of stations along your other lines is suddenly thrown into chaos as one of them transforms from a lynchpin of a triangle into a nightmare of a leaf shape! LEAVES ARE LITERALLY ON THE TRACK AND CAUSING ISSUES!You're promptly sacked from your job as a metro manager.It's a great game.Lots of locations that all had their own unique quirks and tube map layouts. Short fun games that'll help you unwind and lose yourself to the madness of rail layouts.(More HERE[mozillogames.tumblr.com])			"

								Really simple game but that doesn't mean it's no fun. It's far from being boring. In the game you only have to bring passengers from one sybmol (Station) to another. For delivering them you get points... That's all. Well that's why you get hooked on Mini Metro 'cause you want to beat ""the""/your highstocre. When one station is overfloated by passengers you will loose. The result then looks like a real metro plan.Also  it's pretty unseful that you can decide if you want to play in day or night mode. This feature changes the color of the game from bright to dark. So your monitor won't dazzle you at night ;D ...I hope the audio comes soon and will be as great as the rest of the game.Like it or not, but this game is awsome!			"

								The simplicity of the design is fantastic.  The visuals perfectly match those seen on metro maps around the globe.  The gameplay is clear to the player from the outset: help passengers get from get where they are to where they want to go - and do it in a way that scales.  It gracefully strips away the unneeded bits of land use you see in Sim City and presents a city as stations, minimalist topography, and people classified according to their intended type of destination.I cannot wait to see the finished product with audio to match.  This team is doing an awesome job.			"

								A fast pased game in which you hae to connect the ever growing amount of subway stations without letting ques get too big. This is a very enjoyable game, however there is no save option so you have to keep the window open.			"

								Only in early access, this simple yet delightful puzzler is sure to kill some serious time. At first glance, mini-metro seems extremely simple and relatively easy, however dig a little deeper and this game will bend you over the proverbial table. The minimalist design is refreshing and suits the game perfectly. I thoroughly recommend this game.			"

								This is a very addictive, simple, beautiful and elegant game. You have to create and manage underground lines and trains to get passengers between stations, and it's quite a rewarding experience to see your creation when you've lots of stations on screen, all connected up and delivering efficiently!

												I have not a single bad thing to say about this game. I bought this game around April this year when it was early access after I saw a youtuber play it just out of the blue. As I was watching the video I thought that this could be a game that I would enjoy. After purchasing it I played it for a little while and could see myself getting addicted to it. The concept of the game is simple; run a subway/metro at one of the many locations from around the world that the developers have offered. To do this it is as simple as clicking and dragging the lines to the new stations that continue to appear as your progress through the weeks. At the end of the week you receive a new locomotive and you also then get the choice between two options that are given to you. They could be a new line, a new carriage, tunnels (which come in handy on the maps that have bodies of water that must be traversed) or even an interchange (these come in handy when you have one particular stop with many lines running through it.)The actual design of the game is simplistic and minimalistic in nature. Since April the design of the interface itself has changed and developed into one of the nicest looking interfaces I have seen. It is easy on the eyes and is easy to navigate so any new comers could easily immerse themselves in the game.The developers themselves have been continually updating this game for the players, adding new challenges and content to keep it interesting. Never fear however, even if these challenges were not available you would still find yourself lost in the game. Each play through on any map is extremely different to any previous play throughs due to the fact that each station that spawns in is random. Thus this keeps the game from becoming stale and keeps it rather interesting as you can never guess where and what kind of station will show up next.Keeping up with everything can be a real challenge at times, especially as more and more stops appear on the map and more and more passengers wait at these stops. Even so that does not make the game at all stressful and is actually oddly peaceful and satisfying to play.Every time I play I find myself saying, ""Just one more week (in game) and I'll stop"" but that one more week turns into two more weeks which turns into three more weeks and before I know it I have spent 3 hours in the game. The simple drive to keep the lines running as smoothly as possible and to get as many passengers to their destination as possible is the thing that becomes rather addictive.  Overall it is fantastic. The design is utterly perfect for this kind of game (it looks just like a metro map would), the controls are extremely easy, there are plenty of cities to play, the interface is minimalistic and overall the dev team have done a wonderful job. I would suggest anyone buy it really. Even if you only play it on the off occasion for an hour or two it is totally worth it!			"

												Mini Metro is a calming, charming minimalist puzzle game - lots of buzzwords there I know, but it's very pleasant in its simplicity. You draw lines between stations, which are denoted with shapes (triangles, squares, etc) and passengers want to go to specifically shaped stations. Gameplay therefore is optimizing your lines so square passengers aren't waiting forever to get to the square station, and so on.Complexity is added with special stations, an increasing spawn rate of passengers and new stations (thus increasing the pressure on you) and upgrades that you get every week, from new lines, new carriages, to other, special things. There's a good variety in maps, too - not only do they have new layouts for the stations, they throw in rivers and lakes that you need to navigate around or over with your limited stock of tunnels and bridges.It hits that sweet spot between simplicity and complexity, basically. So - extras. There's the main mode, there's an endless mode, there's Extreme mode where you can't redraw any of your lines (yikes!) and there are the daily challenges, which hand you a random map and mode and compare your score with the internet's. There's a speed setting, so you can pause the game or speed it up as needed, although it doesn't go as fast as I'd like in some of the slower levels...but then you hit places like Auckland and you play that map at the main speed because going slightly faster will drown you!Now: Most of Mini Metro is chill, as you sort out your trains and enjoy the maps. It's a game you can meditate to as you finish levels and collect achievements.Then you hit the second half of the achievements, where they give you crazy challenges like ""you can only use two tunnels"" or ""every line must connect to one station"". These are hard, and require total mastery of the game's mechanics as well as a little luck - but they're also a good learning curve! You realize you have to play more carefully with the first one, then slowly ramp up until you're ready to face San Francisco and Auckland. The game goes from being chill to this crazy rush where your lines must be optimized perfectly as you rush around triaging passagers with your extra lines and hoping it's enough to last until you have a high enough score.In short: Mini Metro is a lot of fun, and the challenge is nicely optional. Check it out!			"

								This game is pretty-much exactly what it seems to be - you draw the map, make sure the passengers can get where they're going.It's super-charming and great to play.If I have a complaint, it goes slow, slow, slow, slow, faster, FAST, you're dead - I think a bit of tuning to that would be nice (I spend 7% of every game waiting for things to happen and 25% desperately trying to STOP then happening!)Fantastic idea - really well executed - just needs a few tweaks in the difficulty curve perhaps?

								Mini Metro is a mini strategy puzzle game. The idea is to link up stations so commuters can get to there destination. The longer you are in the game the more demanding the commuters become and this is where you need to place you railway lines strategically.The games concept is simple but can get difficult quickly. This makes each game you play short and sweet. It is fun and can be addictive, trying to better your high score each time.The graphics are simple but effective for a game like this.There is currently no sound however I believe that this is one of the things they are currently working on.This game is no way complete and there are many things they need to add. However there is plenty to do for the price you play.Highly recommend this game. The games are short depending on how good you get. Also the idea is simple, fun  and addictive.			"

												I respect the hard work from the developers and appreciate the frequent updates, however some of the major design flaws make the gameplay more of a frustration than a mental challenge.A few glaring flaws:1. RNG decides how well you do. There are situations where it's absolutely impossible for you to get the city specific achievements. You can be using exactly the same strategy, and do exceptionally well/poor in different ocassions. That's unacceptable for a game that's essentially a time waster (even at maxmum speed, each game can take a long time to complete, with the first 10 mins completely boring and unnecessary).2. The game challenges you by making the same stations appearing in close proximity - many times had  I had over 6 circles (and zero of any other kind) on the same island. At this point, it becomes a chore to manage the situation, and you wonder why the developers didn't try something more refreshing to make the game challenging.3. The train loading optimization is poor - the simple rules the developer put together simply aren't enough. Here is an important one: a train should drop off passengers to pick up high priority passengers (those who are going to unique stations and the only way for them to arrive is through taking this one line).  4. The maxim speed in the game is way too slow, there should be way more then 2 levels of speed, I personally think the highest speed should be at least 3 to 4 times faster than the current maximum speed. This is very simple to implement, and making the game much less of a time waster. (At least giving the player control of how they would like to play the game.)If the developers are able to make changes to address the design flaws, I would gladly change my reccomendation to positive. After all the execution of the game is quite well and the idea has a lot of potential to be a truly fun strategy/puzzle game.			"

												Quite ok but not perfect.A small strategy game, starting with a blank map, where different kinds of upcoming stations (that produce waiting passengers) must be connected via lines. Trains added to lines have to transport the passengers before the waiting time gets too high. Unfortunately passengers do act less logically sometimes. When a train enters a station that connects the current station to one the passengers want to go to, they still do not enter, if in the other direction the same kind of station does exist more closely as well. In reality this would make perfect sense, in Mini Metro however not really, for the passengers just should want to find any way to such a station. In my case this meant game over just before finishing the city's goal because noone entered the train. A Pain in the♥♥♥♥♥for sure. Another thing is that in San Fran from one second to another the numbers of passengers in all stations really explode so that the game is lost currently. Some updates are yet to be made to fix such issues. For some entertainment meantimes and 10€ it's a quite and nice idea however and kind of fun.			"

												Disappointing this could have been an awsome game. At first, I was totally swallowed up by this game but there is a problem. There is a low ceiling to this game. Just as it gets interesting the stations overload that ends the game. And at first, you think it is because of your strategy. But that isn't the case the problem is their algorithm. Each type of station has a shape and that shape generates all but its own shape. That's not the problem. The problem is that some games only have one square station. I played Osaka this has one square there are twenty-five circles and eleven triangles they are all producing squares at the same rate as triangles and circles. At about 2500 point you will fail you can't get the square passengers all to the one square without overloading a station. And if you overload a station you loose. Now you might get a little higher in a different scenario but that's only because you have more squares.			"

												I would recommend the game only with strong reservations. It isn't really as much a game of skill as I hoped after trying it the first time. After playing somewhat longer, it proves that the way the game progresses, it is practically impossible to really as much solve a routing problem than hope to get lucky with how the different stations appear. Design- and looks-wise, the minimalism and Tube-map style of the graphics is appealing, but unfortunately the game depends on other factors than player skill after a certain point in the normal mode.

												Not worth the cost.This game has quite a bit going for it with a very minimalist UI, but its minimalist style is also a drawback as quite often, you lose due to trains heaping up, or because it's a pain in the bottocks to re-arrange the lines. As it stands, I would say it's a good game if it'd cost about $3 or 4,  but it's not worth the current price.			"

												This is a wonderful, relaxing little puzzle game with an attractive, minimalist style to both its audio and visuals, and mechanics straightforward enough that the game never needs to explicitly spell them out for you. Despite the simplicity of the mechanics, though, this is a brainbender extraordinaire; those of you who enjoy setting up systems to work in the most efficient manner possible will have an absolute blast here.The concept is simple: you're in control of the subway system. Stations open across the map gradually, and you need to connect them with different coloured lines. Stations have different shapes, and the shapes of the ""commuters"" that appear at each station represent where they want to go. You will, then, need to plan out your routes so that there's minimal inefficiency; ""circle"" commuters will only ever want to go to ""square"" or ""triangle"" initially, for example, so there's little sense in making a line entirely out of circle stations.As the game progresses, the map expands and the number of possible shapes for the stations increases, too, until eventually you're having to consider things like interchanges extremely carefully as well as just the routes for your lines, particularly if you're playing on the ""Extreme"" mode, where once you've laid a line down, you can't change it!This is a highly enjoyable, inventive puzzle game, then, and particularly recommended to those who want something a little ""gentler"" than the big-budget fare of today!

								I have been having a good time with this game, it is currently early in development and does not have any music yet. Great to play while listening to something. Each time you play you will get better at designing sound efficient systems. The leaderboards give incentive to improve yourself. I have only played this game as of this review for 5 hours and i can see myself playing it for a lot more.It is very calm, and includes a night mode if you are not a fan of looking at a white screen the whole time. I can proudly say that for a few of the maps I am in the top 1000 best players, and I plan to do even better. Small decisions such as a new tunnel or line while small at firsst can mean a big difference. I saw this game after watching a youtube video of it by the youtuber Sips and decided to jump on it due to its simple puzzle and strategy elements. You are able to pause it at any moment to restructure your stations and routes. I give this game a solid pat on the back so to speak. I am looking forward to the new maps.			"

												A masterpiece of design. Clean, simple, elegant, easy to learn, and yet hard to master (try getting into the top 10% on every level). Not more than it has to be nor less, it is as close to perfect in the execution of this design concept as can probably be achieved. The only criticism I can level against the game is the randomness of the choices between days. Sometimes you just don't get any 'tunnel luck.' Also, the music and sound are pleasant at first, but as the game runs long it can layer into an annoying dishormony of sounds. Overall I highly recommend it.			"

												This game is as casual as it gets.Mini Metro is a strategy-puzzle game where you must connect stations, which pop in at random intervals and are of a certain shape (circle, square, star etc), with lines and move commuters to their destinations. The commuters also possess shapes corresponding to the shape of the station they want to get to. There can be multiple stations of a certain shape (2 squares or 5 triangles and so on) so a triangle commuter may get down at any triangle station but as more and more stations pop in and your network grows and the number of commuters increase, it becomes a frantic game of figuring out which lines to connect to the new stations and where to provide new cars and trains which is where the strategy kicks in because almost everything is limited. This includes the number of lines you can place, the number of bridges (It must also be mentioned that all maps have rivers which can only be crossed by using bridges), the number of trains you are provided and the number of carriages you are given which can be used to increase a train's capacity. You are also limited by the fact that 2 lines cannot cross each other except if they meet at a station. The one respite you get is that lines can be infinitely long but even then you must be careful because a train cannot change directions midway and must move the entire length of a line before it turns back making overly long lines almost completely useless.If all this sounds frantic, it's because it is. But the beauty of this game lies in the fact that you can control the pacing of the game. Want a zen, calming experience of simply drawing lines between stations and watch commuters move almost akin to a screensaver? Or do you want to be challenged and find your way to the top of the billboards and high scores and make your mark? ell, they have that covered too. But the surprising amount of strategy required to play this game ensures that it really never gets dull even after many hours of play, partly due to the random nature of the placement of the stations hat pop up over time. There is no optimal line placement and train assignment because every play is unique. Despite being random though, the game never becomes unfair or too punishing. This might either be due to the very nature of the game and how it deals with the randomness but I never once found myself feeling that a station was unfairly placed where it was impossible to reach or unserviceable. All the various systems come together very cohesively to make for a light, casual experience or a fast-paced and urgent, but never unfair, game.The graphics are exceedingly simple, borrowing heavily from the route maps one sees on real life metros. The art style lends itself incredibly well to the gameplay, making it very easy to understand the flow of commuters at a glance simply by following the colors of the lines you placed.The audio is equally minimalistic with small sounds to indicate the flow of commuters and trains but it never crosses the line into being realistic and loud. It is simply indicative of activity and adds a lot to the already Zen nature of the game. I literally dozed off for a minute or so once playing this game and that is absolutely not a bad thing, especially after a long and tiring day of work.If you want nothing more than to sit back, relax and enjoy some calming gameplay, or if you want something with strategy and quick-thinking involved, then Mini Metro has you covered on both fronts. I highly recommend you pick this game up.			"

												Minimalism: It is a minimalist game, above all it is minimalist by design. You can read this post[devlog.dinopoloclub.com] by the developers of this game blog.The game is really, really minimalistic, do not misunderstand me, I like also minimalistic games, but the first Steam tag is ""Strategy"", then ""Simulation"" tag. Here you will find no strategy and no simulation, just minimalism.About the gameplay, you have very few things to control, stations pop out in the game randomly, and above all even if disconnected from trails the people start to wait and going upset if they are unable to reach their kind of destination. You have no money budget to spend in something you think you need when you need it, there is no construction costs, but instead, every week you could get a new train or a new trail or a new vagon or an interchange improvement for a station, or finally a new tunnel/bridge. Naturally you can only get your week things budget if and only if your week score is high enough...There is no construction or demolition time. Stations have no range, just people that need to reach their kind of destination. If you change stations with nodes and people with weight you could play with a subset of the math graph theory...LOL...At the moment there is no editor.So, finally if and only if, you are looking for a really minimalistic game, you could be satisfied, apart the price that is not such a minimalistic price, maybe best to wait for sales, otherwise this game is really too much minimalistic...Sorry but, I have to not suggest this game to the public.

												The minimalist design is beautiful, and it's a pleasant casual game. I'm not recommending it because there's just not a whole lot to sink your teeth into strategy wise. Unlocking the maps was trivial with just my very basic, unchanging strategy - and trying to top my own high scores just wasn't enough to keep me hooked for long.			"

												EH.I played it a bit, and I can definitely see the appeal, but this game isn't for me.  Each level starts off easy, but quickly spirals out of control. The game tosses in new points and people for your network to accomodate, and though the growth rate of the network accelerates, your rate of aquiring assets does not. What's worse, is that I kept feeling like I just wanted it to pause for a minute so I could figure out if I was doing things right, but it grinds reletlessley forward withough giving you time to think.  I guess what I miss the most is a chance to learn and improve, but each round gets so out of hand that I don't have time to learn what I'm doing wrong. I suppose enough trial and error would get me there, but I like a game that gives me a ramp to climb instead of expecting me to fail my way through.If you dig quick games, and you enjoy hectic game play, then this may be the game for you. It's easy to learn and hard to master, and the interface is nice on the eyes. The audio ties into the actions occuring on screen, which got old quick for me, but others seem to really dig it. There's multiple game modes, and many levels.All in all, I suspect that this is a great game that I happen to have no taste for. Though others seem to love it, I don't think I'll be reccomending it to any of my friends.			"

												A puzzle game about building a highly abstracted mass transit system - there is no “solution” to the puzzles, just the question of how long you can keep meeting an ever rising demand.I admire both the aesthetic and pacing of this game.The interface is beautifully minimal, both providing everything you need to understand and play the game while evoking the classic topological underground map.The pacing is well executed with periods of calm where you feel in control, followed by periods of frantic activity as new stations and special stations force rapid change across your network.So why haven’t I played it more?Access to the depth - I don’t think the game lacks meaningful choices; when I look at the scores people have achieved (more than doubling my best on my most played cities) there are clearly things I can do to improve.

								A strangely compelling puzzle game. The mechanics are simple and intuitive (they could use a more in depth tutorial for track editing, loops, and so forth, however), and it's one of the few puzzle games that felt like creative thinking was necessary. Even at Early access, it's a well made game. The solid aesthetic is refreshing, I only ran into a bug once, and it feels polished. Not finished, mind. There's still a few levels and modes missing, as well as sound (hopefully that will change for the better)			"

								The game is basically about moving passengers from one station to the next, by using public transportation. You decide where these lines go, how they are connected and how many vehicles and carriages there are on each line. Every game starts you off softly, and get increasingly difficult as time passes. At the end of each week in the game, you recieve bonuses. Pick wisely ;)I bought this at a sale and have never regretted it. Knowing what i know now, i wouldn't mind paying full price for it either. It's a gem of a small time waster. One which i wholeheartedly reccomend to everyone who think they might be interested in this game.10/10 Excellent game for what it tries to be.			"

It's hard to get a feel for what's working and what is not. It's very interesting through, I think I just need a little more advice and information. For instance, what are the advantagtes and disadvatages of a circular line? How many people leave and visit each station? How about some interesting stats about the various metros around the world. All in all, I like the game a lot, hence why I just want a little more.......			"

								This is an interesting little game which is still in development at time of writing but is definitely worth a play!  The aim of the game is to create an efficient network of subway stations, so as not to allow a build up of waiting passengers at any one place.  The difficulty of the game increases the longer that it is played, allowing it to maintain a level of difficulty even when you think that you have figured out the best way to plan your network, this keeps the game playable for longer. Each time you start a game the initial nodes are randomised so no two games are identical.  There are three different modes to play the game in thus far:Normal - Don't let the stations overcrowdEndless - Aim for the most efficient networkExtreme - Lines cannot be changed once placedIf you want a game to fill a fifteen minute gap this could be for you.If you want a stratagy game which will keep you playing for a little longer, this could also be for you.

								Yeah this is a pretty solid puzzler that is in Early Access. Even though there is no music, and limited features, I certainly will get my money's worth here (6.99$). Really solid gameplay mechanic that is easy to learn and probably near-impossible to master. Great minimalistic design aesthetic with addicting gameplay. The developer's also seem in-tune with the community, and really, what they claim they will add does not seem that far from what they already have in place. If there was a transport sim rogue-like, this may be it. It has:-Random depot spawns-I believe (Random) spot along the river where the focus starts-RPG-like leveling up via weekly upgrade choices and resource management-Permadeath-The ability to pauses and make decisions is not *quite* turn-based, but damned close-Ability to solve goals using different strategies (high complexity)-Player vs. worldThere is not:-Fantasy elements-Grid-based			"

The difficulty of the game increases the longer that it is played, allowing it to maintain a level of difficulty even when you think that you have figured out the best way to plan your network, this keeps the game playable for longer. Each time you start a game the initial nodes are randomised so no two games are identical.  There are three different modes to play the game in thus far:Normal - Don't let the stations overcrowdEndless - Aim for the most efficient networkExtreme - Lines cannot be changed once placedIf you want a game to fill a fifteen minute gap this could be for you.If you want a stratagy game which will keep you playing for a little longer, this could also be for you.

												An amazing time killer puzzle-like game!You have to connect stations using coloured lines and bridges.But the hard bit, making the metro network to be efficent, and atthe same time fast. Overcrouding will shutdown your metro!Another cool feature is the locations. Locations like Melbourne have bridges and trams,where places like London and Paris have tunnels and locomotives.Theres good achievments too. And the community provides sone neat helpful guides, thoughyou don't have to read a guide to learn how to play!All in all, this game is really addictive, and unlike some games, it doesn't really have an end-game.It's also priced good, at US$9.99, it's full of content. I really recommend this game! "

												One of those games you can just zone out to, while still being challenging if you want to build a perfect system. It's easy to unlock all cities, but to master the game is hard. A new station will always pop up in a location that'll mess up your entire perfect looking metro loop. Play it on endless to just zone out, or try and get a high score if that's more your thing.All in all, it's a very hypnotic experience, with the subtle little bloops mixing well with the ambient background music. Quite good for a minimalist experience.			"

												Minimalist graphics.Train logistics.Slow building where each scenario starts with 3 stations, then adds new stations and passengers over time.By far, what I find most satisfying about this game, is watching the train simulation, watching passengers get on and off trains.  The mechanism is the same as other train simulators and the lightweight graphics don't detract from the experience and immersion.The logistics consist of creating paths so common passenger destinations are accessible in minimal stops, while rare destinations are still handled in a timely fashion.  Also, just because a station is full and a train arrives, doesn't mean anybody will get on board, since the passengers seem to choose a train going to the nearest destination, not the earliest destination... (i.e. they'll wait a week to get on the train which has their stop next, rather than getting on this train that has their stop 2 stops down in the other direction) - at least it looked like that's what they are doing.Choose between new engine types, new routes, bridges, or carriages.  As stations become overcrowded with unserviced passengers, eventually the scenario will end, with an option to continue in endless mode.  Endless mode is fun as the game turns into mostly a free-form sandbox train station simulator.  Setting up one train to have a long chain of cars is pretty nice.I loved Sid Meier's Railroad and Mini Metro provides a lot of the same enjoyment.  Gameplay starts a little too slow, and after about 2 minutes picks up enough to become interesting.  Good tension.  Each map seems to generate stops randomly, so the same map played twice can be very different.  It would be nice to have an RNG seed interface to play the same map and station order repeatedly, but the game is still enjoyable as it is.  $10 - fair price.			"

Brilliantly combines transportation management with challenging strategy, engrossing patterns and minimalist game design.Playing on ""Night Mode"" in a dim room is a fabulously relaxing, sometimes meditative experience, especially now that such lovely audio is now built into the game.  If you have a soft spot for logistical management, interesting game design and absorbing, procedurally generated music, Mini Metro is for you!			"

												A more fair pricing would be $5, like in iOS. :)[Edit 10/27]The game is skewed against you.While playing the game, most will reach a threshold impossible to maneuver out of, especially because of the seemingly random nature of the game. This is so because the weekly completion reward of one train does not increase exponentially with the increased amount of stations/passengers, especially increase in 'varied' stations. Then as one reaches around ~2000 passengers, the congestion becomes impossible to maneuver out of, not matter how good you play. Of course, there are some that can reach 3000 or even 4000, but this is simply due to the luck of the straw, or luck of what stations spawn where.This is a major oversight by the developers, one which shouldn't have existed to begin with. What is the point of playing something in which you know full well you will reach a certain threshold from the very beginning? Why is the weekly reward of one train when having 10 stations the same as having 30, 40 or more varied stations? Doesn't make sense.Possible fix? Increase the amount of weekly trains rewarded exponentially after a couple of weeks of play.I have asked for a refund after playing three games because there is no getting better and one can only count on better luck, not to mention it gets very repetitive. Replay value is also severely diminished knowing your imminent fate at a certain point in the game is certain.			"

												I wish I liked this more than I do. I sort of get the basics but I feel like the RNG is too random to the point of just creating unfair situations you simply don't have the resources to deal with. There's an endless sense of hopelessness underlying this game and it just ends up really frustrating and unfun to play. No mater what you do you're going to fail eventually, and sometimes it'll be your fault, but most other times it'll be the game refusing to give you bridges or spawning 6 circles in the same corner of the map.

												It's kinda boring... what essentially happens is that you build metro lines, wait, do the next thing that is obivously the right thing to do, keep waiting, repeat until you accidentaly do something wrong or you realise your strategy doesn't work anymore. If the former, you get incredibly frustrated. If the latter, you get incredibly frustrated.			"

								I only really recommend this game to buy when it's on sale; I think it's a little too much for not a vast amount of gameplay.It's a nice game for casual players because most of the time it is just connecting shapes.... then accidently deleting/messing up everything.Fun to play on different cities and see how long you can last for.

												A minimalist game where you start off with a map with three stations: one circle, one square and one triangle. At each station you have people wanting to go to one of the other stations: some wanting to go to the circle, some to the square, and some to the triangle. You connect the stations by drawing a line between them and a train starts running back and forth along it. Problem solved... until another station randomly pops up on the map and you have to connect that as well.As the game goes along more stations pop up and the number of different shapes of stations increase. To combat this you are given more train lines; more trains; more carriages and so on. You have to decide how best to connect all the randomly placed stations with the resources you are given, but eventually you'll get overwhelmed trying to get the right passengers to the right type of station and one of the stations gets too many passengers waiting at it and it's game over. It's all a question of how long you can last and how many passengers you can deliver.It might be a nice little time waster for some people, but I think that the random placement of stations pretty much cancels out most differences between the different maps you're given to play on, and I don't see much fun in trying to connect a bunch of circle stations, that have all randomly appeared adjacent to each other, to the network when nobody at a circle station wants to go to another circle station.

												UhNot too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes insteadIngredients:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour3 tablespoons sugar1 tablespoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg2 large eggs, at room temperature1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as neededNow to make it1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

												Imagine buying diablo and there are only 5 levels of dungeon - As others have said, this game does have a good enjoyable core - but once you break free of that, which is not hard, it gets pretty dull. After 100 or so passengers a day in endless, you stop gaining things. It just keeps going, but you can't aquire any more cars or tracks. And while the design looks clean and simple; there are some very frustrating interactions. want to lay down the red track? first, select the red track then click on a station - oh wait, its laying down a blue track. There are a lot of good things done well in this game - things I really think are worth celebrating - Attentions to details that I find really exciting, and a core concept that is beautiful and elegant. I guess if anything, I would describe this game as such: a finished unfinished game with no updates in months. It's only fault is that there is not enough of it.  "

Each week you are given a choice of upgrades to choose from, and the upgrade you choose can make or break your tube system.

								I really like the concept but unfortunately that’s all it feels like right now: a concept – not even a working beta. I can’t recommend this because it really feels like nothing more than a web-browser game. It is still open beta and it is only like $6 but still I wouldn’t pay $6 for a flash game.Aside from things clearly still in development like sound, more levels, a bunch of options and stuff like that, there’s just no meat to the game. Essentially all you’re doing is dragging lines between dots on the screen not unlike the zillion air traffic controller clones for mobiles. While I’m looking for casual as opposed to a transport simulator, it still needs more to feel like a game. How about currency, pricing, upgradables, a map that zooms out and enlarges as the game progresses, etc.?Don’t get me wrong, the game is fun and super addicting for like 5 or less hours. After that however, there’s just nothing else to do. If you can accept this and have a couple of dollars to burn, go for it. If you are neurotic and have to do simple repetitive tasks to maximize efficiency, play away. If you are looking some actual content or something more than your average free mobile game, I wouldn’t bother. "

								I came across this game through a Let's Play on YouTube and immediately bought it for myself. I really, really wanted to like it. Something like this is right up my alley! Disappointingly, though, I couldn't keep lying to myself and just no longer enjoyed it. In ""Normal"" mode, once you hit 1,000 passengers (even lower on some stages), the difficulty just seems to spike and all of a sudden, multiple (not just one or a few, but like 8) stops suddenly start overflowing, even when my system worked pretty well beforehand, and all of a sudden, my good game comes to a stop. The consistency of this happening caused me to stop playing, sadly. May revisit in the future though.			"

								What is supposed to be fun about this game?  It starts off just telling you to click one place and another to draw a line, but I have no idea what the rules are.  I know the general purpose, you have to connect stations that have a shape and passengers waiting with other shapes to stations that are those shapes, but I don't know why I can't draw a line between certain stations.  Mildly entertaining for about 2 minutes, but if this is supposed to be a puzzle game, I can't figure out how it's meant to be.			"

I know I haven't put much time in it, but that is because I got bored really quickly.This game feels like a more boring version of ""Pipe Dreams"", which for the younger crowd is a game where you have to build a piping system before liquid would flow and points were rewarded for the length of pipe the water traveled through before flooding out of the pipes.I digress. This game is about setting up a ""metro"" system to pick up shapes and deliver them to a station of the same shape. While you are setting up your ""tracks"" new shapes randomly appear as well as patrons. Those shapes have to be integrated into your system before the patrons get frustrated and leave at which point you lose.The bigger problem I have with this game is that there is no way of planning your system as the shape locations appear at random. There is a way to restructure your system but the interface feels unintuitive and I'm never sure if when I remove tracks/trams that they return to my inventory. From what I can tell - trams do not - and therefore you are punished for a restructure that you couldn't have planned before.This game feels like a mobile game, best experienced on the crapper.I hesitate to say this game is horrible as it has many great reviews, but as a fan of casual games - you can skip this one. Sorry devs.I will give this game more time and if my opinion changes I will update this review.			"

								This game is Better suited for Mobile. It's terribly simple in it's current state. It has some fun replayability to it. It just feels so light on content.  If this was a mobile game i wouldn't hesitate to recomend it for around $5-8. I thought the game would be more about financially managing a subway system and managing passenger loads. It's more of a game that you just manage dots floating around the screen. "

								Minimalist, conceptually fun transport strategy game, but very buggy and badly designed. Can't accomplish anything with strategy when you spend literally all your time fighting the horrible route interface and the arbitrary, random, nonsensical design decisions that make the game more of a time waster where success is based as much on luck as on skill. I read several strategy guides and managed to make headway in the game, eventually beating all the basic level goals, but it was never enjoyable in any way because the game is so fundamentally broken and badly designed. I prefer strategy games, not luck based time wasters. The game has no sound and I literally had more fun listening to my Solar Fields ambient trance albums in the background than I did playing the game.Some examples:Metro lines frequently refuse all attempts to revise their route for absolutely no reason unless you chop out the ENTIRE line and remake it. This is a huge headache and by itself makes the game unplayable when the randomness requires adaptation. I know you can click the route near a station and then drag over the station to remove that section of the route -- I'm saying that sometimes it simply doesn't work, and for no reason that I can discern. EDIT 6/19/2015 - This was fixed in the last patchNew stations spawn randomly (you cannot build stations) and often in places that make level goals inaccessible (e.g. ""Carry 1000 passengers using only 1 tunnel"" but then new stations keep spawning between 2 rivers and long before the map opens up to give you more route options). Or how about the Hong Kong level goal: Move 1100 passengers with only 8 stations per line. Sounds reasonable, until you recognize that stations often spawn INTO your routes and instantly ruin your entire game on the spot. Or Berlin where you must carry the same huge number of passengers using only 1 locomotive per line. What's that? You say the end of week choices didn't offer you another line to run your end of week locomotive on? Too bad. Hit restart, try again, maybe next time you'll get luckier.Passengers often accumulate at a station with multiple empty trains passing by regularly without picking them up for absolutely no reason (connecting lines properly placed to destination, sometimes destination was even on the same line!) and this is yet more hair pulling insanity because within 30 seconds or so of passengers not being picked up at a station it's BLAM GAME OVER because the game ends the instant people have to wait too long for a train pickup. Why? I have no idea. That's just what the developer chose. Several times I got Game Over despite clearing the passengers out of the station just before the timer ran out. I don't know why. There seems to be no fundamental locational supply and demand for stations (it's all random) and only a tenuous connection between time of day and passenger movements, if there IS any connection. I get that the different geometry icons and the way they evolve independent of the player is designed to simulate a city economy moving and the metro having to adapt to changing demand but in practise the implementation is so scattered, crazy, and random that it makes no sense and is the antithesis of fun to have to deal with. Real world metrorail transport doesn't work this way. Combine this with all the other interface headaches and you'll likely be passionately hating the game before you get too far.These fundamental problems make the game generally unplayable, unenjoyable, and outright annoying, and I could not possibly recommend this pile of disasterous development and unsound design. The fact that the game has no sound has no bearing on the final verdict. It's just bad.---------------UPDATE 6/19/2015I've played this game several more hours and beat all the maps since I wrote this review and I still feel essentially the same. A patch removed the problem with track route not changing but the more I play the more I realize that the main game mode (not endless or extreme) is based almost entirely on luck of the draw with you predestined to fail sooner or later. To get the goals and unlock the extreme modes you have to have some combination of lucky starting position, lucky station spawns, and lucky end week choices. Sure, you need good planning and careful manipulation of the routes on top of that as well, but do you really want to play a game that force fails you based on luck no matter how skilled you are? I don't. I still don't recommend this game unless you like wasting time. It's a decent time waster, but a bad strategy game.			"

WARNING: THIS IS A VERY VERY OLD REVIEW AND IS NO LONGER RELEVANT!I HAVE NOT HAD THE TIME TO PLAY AND REVIEW THIS GAME SINCE THE UPDATE THAT ADDED SOUND!TL;DR: There is NOT ONE SINGLE SOUND in the entire game, which makes it suck.If you are thinking about buying this game then do one thing for me before you do:1) Go up to the video trailer and watch it with the audio muted.Do you like the game without sound?  Well that's what it will probably be like forever!  This game was released nearly two years ago and doesn't even HAVE A TIMELINE for when audio will be added.  This game went from ""fun"" to ""boring"" in about one hour and the primary culprit was the complete lack of audio.Update:The developer responded to me (in detail) about the complications surrounding audio support and gave a projection as to when it should be finished.  I am interested in seeing the result, but time will tell if I change my mind and start recommending it.			"

								I was kind of amazed to find out that there is absolutely no sound whatsoever in this game. Judging by the developer's comments on the forum it looks like there's some holdup with the procedural audio generation which is totally reasonable considering this is Early Access... but not even a single placeholder effect? Really?To add to the confusion, turning the sound on and off is an option in the Main Menu... but it does nothing because there is no sound to turn on or off.Seems like it might be a fun game once it's done, but beware of the developer's estimation that it will be released in ""mid 2015"".

								Feeling more negative than positive at the moment. May change my mind later once it's released proper andsome more changes via updates arrive.Idea is good but can't give it the thumbs up yet.Too many circles keep popping up next to each other [not random at all!].....they make up nearly half the shapes. The loops loop the wrong way on some shapes which then make it impossible to lay other routes over them! Then you get stations popping up on existing routes which are then 'throughplatforms' so trains don't stop there!Would be nice to have levels/goals for each city and to earn the tunnels/bridges/carriage/line quicker than at present.Sound is coming later...so a bit boring without it at the moment.

								This is the worst game I have ever played.  It opens up in the middle of a ""game"" which turns out to be completely abstract -- the transportation of shapes to other shapes.  One can infer that these shapes are people who desire to go to a city of the corresponding shape; however, there are no tutorials, tooltips, passenger desires, etc.  I have NO idea how this game achieved such high reviews, but I suspect foul play.

								Its a pity that this game fails where it could take an interesting concept and make it a great game.There is no ""levels"" so you basically play on the same terrain until you are overwhelmed - I've played to easily over 40+ stations which is *really* crowded on a screen you can't scroll - this game always leaves you with he fealing that you have failed with no chance of an achievement like finally completed London at level one for example.The only real obstacle is a river for which you have a limited number of tunnles - randomly you sometimes can cross one line with another, but this is never explained in any kind of tutorial so who knows what the rules are....!Maybe one day it will have a proper tutorial and some kind of progression, without any sense of progression the game is rather bland and not terribly interesting - a real shame...

								This is a simple game about building train lines.You connect stations with trainlines; that's the whole game.A big feature and one of the main elements of the game is re-routing trainlines; adding stations, deleting stations or removing trainlines altogether.Want to continue the trianline? There's no clear function to do that.Want to remove a station from a trainline? There's no clear function to do that.Want to remove a trainline? There's no clear function to do that.""Hey, why don't you just look up what the commands are."" You might say, thinking yourself both sage & wise.Guess what? The game has no control layout section. Want to find out what the controls are? Can't.Want to Rebind keys? Can't.Why don't you just go to their website and look up the controls there?"" Guess what? They don't have them listed.Bonus Bu11sh!t: Like the game you're playing and want to save, so you can play later? You know; one of the most basic game functions coming standard on all games since 1985? Can'tIn Conclusion: Fu<k this game and this is truly the LAST time I buy Early Access ANYTHING, I don't care how good it looks on youtube.Don't Buy this half-Fished uncooked-pizza-dough of a product.

								I bought this game thinking it would be a nice way to spend my Sunday afternoon/evening with a bit of a brain puzzle, based on all of the good reviews here.The game only kept me entertained for 29 minutes.  I know the game is supposed to mimic the look of a transit map, but the plain, flat, minimalistic shapes were really boring to look at.  Did not at all put me in mind of moving people from place to place.  These type of visuals might work much better on a mobile device than on a full PC display.I was frustrated that I could not choose the type of upgrade I needed at some points.  When I needed tunnels, it only offered me lines and locomotives.  When I needed lines, it only offered my tunnels and carriages.Trains seemed to drive by passengers for no good reason - train was not full, and destination stop was only one or two stations down the track.  This really affected playability negatively at higher levels.Maybe in a few more iterations this might be fun, but not yet...			"

												For such a simple game, there is a lot of strategy packed into it. Minimalistic graphics prevent distractions from the real purpose of the game: create a subway layout that is efficient. Using only the three starting lines, you must adapt and quickly change based on where new stops open up. Easy to play, difficult to master. I like becauseupon opening the game for the first time, it puts you in control immediately. You must learn on the go. If you want easy to win, this isn't for you. While challenging, it is simple enough that anyone can pick it up in the matter of a few minutes.			"

								Mini Metro is one of those games that you think will be easy to play and your line will thrive. Although it soon becomes apparent that the task is huge. Each new station that appears, is another problem you have to deal with. You have to manage your resources well to keep your line open. At the end of each round you recieve bonuses like a new train, an additional line or carriage. You decide which, choose wisely or you may just be making your own downfall.You don't need to be a seasoned gamer to get to grasps with this amazing game. Although it's in Early Access, you can see how the game will shape and find new ways to captivate you. The recent addition of Zen Mode keeps you expanding your line for the ultimate Metro.What I love most about this game is that you can not win, only survive the hustle and bustle of the stations for as long as your, hopefully, well planned lines will allow it. The game is aesthetically pleasing - They use the classic coloured lines; like you would see on a metro map. You watch your map expand in realtime as you add more to it. How long can you survive?

								If you are looking for a deep management game, this is not it.If you are looking for an intricate transport tycoon follow up game, this is not it.If you are looking for fancy graphics, this is not it.However, if you are looking for a fun puzzler that'll keep you on your toes with reasonable pressure, simple and clean presentation, easy to grasp concept and lots of replayability, this is one of the best games you can get. And if you don't want to be pressurized by the game, you can play the Zen mode, which is a great relaxing timewaster. Simple, clean, intuitive, it's a great way to waste a few hours without even realizing said hours are gone. Bonus points if you are a fan of metro systems, but that isn't required to enjoy this game.Special props to the devs, who are on top of the community and communicate with their customers a lot during the current stage of the game.

								Very simple and addicting game, looking forward to future updates. The only thing I would like to see change in future updates would be a redistribution of the rates at which the various shapes spawn. Circles spawn so much that it makes it impossible to distribute the shapes across your lines, leading to long stretches of circles that no passengers get off at. rebalancing them with triangles/squares and increasing them turning in to stars and pentagon shapes would make the game less frustrating while not making it easier.Overall very creative and recommended!

								MiniMetro is an absolutely horrible game… every time I fail I think to myself… I'll get it right next time! I know what I did wrong! Nope! This game ate all my time and kept me up well past dawn trying who knows how many permutations of simple graphic subway maps.Anyway, I've spent too much time writing this review. Time to get back to MiniMetro.			"

												For a fairly bare-bones transport sim (you're only delivering passengers, although there is some managing of which station people want to get to, and good luck if you're playing Osaka and you run out of tunnels), it's surprisingly complex, and very addictive. Definitely worth the asking price, would not refund.From playing about 90 minutes, I think the best strategy is to make circle lines and connect them with main lines. But this tends to fall apart when the loops get too big to deal with the passengers, and you run out of lines, and oh God I think they're rioting.			"

								Here is proof you don't need Unity5 to make a GREAT game.It looks a little like the 1970's Atari tennis - but with colour and  A LOT more little blocks moving around. It is essentially a join the dots resource management game - which sounds demeaning but it is not, this is a challenging, fun and addictive game. As the player you get a number of locomotives, carriages, lines and few other goodies with which to build an efficient underground/subway/U-Bahn in a variety of large ciities across Europe, Asia, America and Africa.Passengers mass at stations. They want to go to other stations that match their shape (triangulasr passengers want to go to traingular stations), easy enough but there are quite a few shapes. If to many passengers crowd a station the whole transport system collapses - game over. To move these people you put locomotives on the line, busy lines may mean you have to place extra locos (up tp 4 per line) going in both directions. You only have a limited number of lines and locos which have limited space so.....well you know how these things work. Intersecting train lines, tunnels under rivers and the appearance of specialised stations (hospitals for example) add to the challenge. It's all about getting people out of the system quickly so you can load the next one onto a train and get rid of him to. The problem is the more efficient your train system, the more peole want to use it, so.....well you know how these things work.More stations appear on the map over time, meaning at times a total redesign of track routes etc may be needed.The game is not finished (for example as of writing this, audio is not quite ready), but it is stable and VERY playable - but as I said one of those addicitive 'I'll play just a bit longer"" games that ends up filling your evening.

								If you are looking for a deep management game, this is not it.If you are looking for an intricate transport tycoon follow up game, this is not it.If you are looking for fancy graphics, this is not it.However, if you are looking for a fun puzzler that'll keep you on your toes with reasonable pressure, simple and clean presentation, easy to grasp concept and lots of replayability, this is one of the best games you can get. And if you don't want to be pressurized by the game, you can play the Zen mode, which is a great relaxing timewaster. Simple, clean, intuitive, it's a great way to waste a few hours without even realizing said hours are gone. Bonus points if you are a fan of metro systems, but that isn't required to enjoy this game.Special props to the devs, who are on top of the community and communicate with their customers a lot during the current stage of the game.

								I think this game is not completely same to real world. For example, there are only 7 lines can be used, and lines can't cross without pass station. As we all know, in the real world, for example Shanghai, are 14 metro lines now, and lines cross without pass station is exist too. So I hope developers could make this game more real. But I also recommand this game, because it's very interesting and in progress.			"

												Not an Native English speaker but want to introduce this game to more people who don't know about Chinese. So maybe some strange Chinglish sry.Not everyone would like this game but it is a good game for me. Played 6 hours until I bought this game for a half day.Easy to get how to play this. Just drag your mouse to link stations with line and watch the metro automaticlly working. A person marked by circle want to go to any circle station, so as other shapes. It's addictive but will not spend so much time for a round (such as Sid Meier's Next Turn Civ V) so you can easily stop if you are not trying to get the achivement such as ""Ten weeks in Osaka"" or what what what in HongkongAnd there're something I must notice to everyone new here. Different maps have different limits, such as London can only put 3 locomotive per line but Osaka can put 4. Without this, there're some special in some maps, such as Osaka have Shinkansen which is a faster locomotive but can only get 1 if you don't choose 2 normal locomotive in a new week, or in Cairo, a locomotive can only take 4 people instead of normally 6.Such a easy-understand game I want to introduce to my parents and I think my dad and mom will also like this game....Eventhought they don't know how to play Minesweeper.9/10, not full mark because I think there can be more maps with much fun and I'm waiting for it  (oh plz don't ask the author to do what you cannot do)  ok ok if I have to give a point without what new things the game should add (in my opinion), then 10/10New: Just read some what Chinese guys wrote, most of them was hoping for Beijing  but I have to say oh not terrible enough Beijing Metro is  "

								If you like a game that you can just jump in and out of, then Mini Metro is certainly a good place to start. When you add the fact that there are many different challenging aspects to the game, it becomes more than just a time-killing game and enters the catagory of pure strategy, And if that isn't enough there's an incredibly statistical post-game analysis focus too, for those that feel the need to find out how to improve on what they've already done. If you also like a game to feel crisp and well made, then this has that feeling in abundance. Even the simplicity of cascading through the menus has a very polished feel.You really can't go wrong with this game, especially for the price. You will not feel cheated at all. In fact, what ever level of gamer you are, you'll feel challenged at some point, guaranteed!			"

								This game is extremely addictive! Just when you think you've got the perfect metro network at your hands, one or more stations changes it's type, requiring you to review your lines and train assignments. The only easy moments is right after the game starts with 3 lines and 3 trains, as the weeks progress more types of stations will appear, you will make choices that have direct impact on the next week, but the game will never get easier. Passengers and stations appear faster, and while you try your hardest to keep your main hubs from overcrowding... BAM!! a station on the edge of town escaped your attention, it overcrowds  and it's game over. You wonder how it could have happened but you start the game again, and again. It's fun, I totally recommend this game, it'll give you many hours of strategic planning, a bit of frustration but also fulfilment at completing the Steam Achievements... Good luck!!			"

								Very nice game, demonstrating that simple concepts can make very addictive complex challenges. Graphics are clean and nice; I guess sounds will also be when it will be available. This game is a casual one in the very good sense of the term: when I haven't a lot of time available, I'm playing it, have fun, an filled my free time with a good moment. Despite the limited number of maps, trying to improve our best score ensure replayability.			"

								This might be the most satisfying puzzle game you'll ever play. Particularly if you've ever lived in a place where being able to navigate a complex subway or rail system was an important part of your life, you own it to yourself to pick this up and spend some time with it. The rules are simple, intuitive. You can learn to play in 5 minutes. The resulting strategy is complex and rewarding. It's a game that feels both abstract and practical. This sat in my wishlist for months because of it's early access status. Having bought and played it, I can say it's extremely playable in it's current state. If it wasn't missing the audio you'd never guess it wasn't completely finished.			"

								You'll know exactly what I mean when I say that sometimes, you just want a fun, simple game that you can sit down and play for half an hour before daily life resumes. This game fills that role perfectly, artistically, and like it was designed for that express purpose. I find I can't really get invested in this game. I can play for a half-hour before I get bored, but that's fine, because that's really all I NEED to play. I can sit down, beat one of the cities, and resume my daily life.The game has you designing underground metro train systems for major cities, the likes of which include Hong Kong, New York, and Sao Paulo. The colorful little graphics are incredibly soothing, coupled with the calm background music. The game definitely does get frustrating at times, especially when you run out of bridges or your line doesn't work correctly. However, it teaches you to find a way to move past that. It's almost a puzzle game, but not really. If I had to classify it, I'd put it in the casual strategy category.I actually cannot think of any cons that this game has. It is early access, and man, for an early access game, it's amazing. I tend to associate 'early access' with 'broken, unfinished and poorly-optimized', but this goes against all of those stereotypes. I have found exactly zero glitches, and the game doesn't feel unfinished, - perhaps constantly-growing is the right word. I'd love to see more cities, maybe a bus element, I'm not sure. I'll leave that part up to the developers.]Overall, yes, I do recommend this game. And for the modest price of $7.79, why not?			"

												I was hesitating to buy this game and kept it on the wishlist for a longer while, as it seemed expensive. When the Summer Sale came, I decided to buy something I really wanted to play. I felt like a transport sim, but Cities in Motiton didn't get good reviews, while Cities:Skylines were not cheap enough for me. Therefore I had only one choice within my budget and - to my surprise - It seems to be one of the best games for me in my collection!First off, one of my favourite games of all time are: - FTL - a more or less typical rougelike with significant strategy portion - Transport Tycoon / Locomotion series - where one of the main tasks is to build efficient networksCombine the two above and you get MiniMetro :).I'm a busy guy, and I don't have more than a couple of hours every day to play games. Therefore I turn more and more frequently to short games, that I can finish in a day or two, with high replay value. Mini Metro fits this description perfectly. Randomly generated stations are always a challenge (fourth circle or triange station in a condensed area drive me nuts!), while variety of cities encourage to try different strategies. I hope the descriptions will be added soon, although discovering the differences is also a kind of fun.One can look at the game as 100 years of a city growth condensed to 15-30 minutes. There are no resources - every ""week"" you get something to expand your network. It might seem strange, that you can re-rout your trains in any possible way. That way the creators avoided making the game extremely difficult - fortunately the ""extreme"" mode exist, adding that piece of realism for hardcore city transport organizers.With such minimalistic design, there is a lot of room for immersion. It's very easy to imagine that triangle and circle station represent every day destinations, like work/home/market. Square is probably a railway station or airport - unique but important. Then there is a bunch of unique ones, that can easily translate to a football stadium, hospital, or other touristic attactions. Even with no sound, you can hear all those crowds, looking at the train with six symbols - each representing a traveller and his destination.One of the best things about this game is the fact, that you are 100% focused on the core - designing the network as efficiently as possible. You don't have to waste more than a few seconds to build the route or add/move trains. If Transport Tycoon was simplified to a white board and lines with rectangles instead of detailed tracks and trains, you could finish the game in a fraction of usual time.Overall - GREAT game! I was not expecting that much from such small game.It's still early access and the devs are working hard to finish it - updates/hotfixes are frequent.FULL VERSION UPDATE: EVEN MORE AWESOME!!!			"

Mini Metro is packed with a very minimal design, a beautiful colour scheme, and a very intuitive interface. It just looks... smooth.

								TL;DR: Simple, beautiful, minimal, engrossing, inspiring.Mini Metro is a minimal, surprisingly relaxing, puzzle game. You create tracks between various different types of station in a bid to keep your city rolling smooth and efficient. Your resources are finite, and as your city expands you need to be strategic about how many tunnels you use, where you place junctions, which lines you put your trains on, how many carriages they have and the order in which your lines intersect different station types.Endless mode provides the most zen experience, with no overcrowding on stations, you can just watch your metro grow stress free. A beautifully minimal sound track sets the mood- again, zen. I have no experience playing this before the sound update so can't comment on what it was like before.			"

								It's a very simple game, I'll give it that. This game mostly catered to me because I'd always been fascinated with subway maps. The order yet complexity of them, especially in larger cities, was something I could easily get lost in.Mini Metro, although still in development, shows excellent AI with the subways. I assumed it was difficult to program in all of the different rails at all of the different connecting stations, let alone the interchanges.My only problem with it was that the lines didn't look as clean as I'd hoped, especially since this game relies fairly heavily on maintaining a ""Realistic subway map"" design. Other than that, this game is very well made, and I would easily recommend it.			"

								Awesome game.  Mini Metro is a really fun minimalistic game.  The drag and drop controls are intuitive and the menus are extremely easy to navigate.  The only downside to this game is the lack of music, however you can easily fix this by playing a relaxed music playlist in the background.  Great game and I can't wait for music to be in game.			"

												A very refreshing and crisp experience. Arguably the best puzzle game I have EVER played in my life. The design is superb and the gameplay is incredible. It has very simple rules and it's easy to pick them up. However as time goes on the matches become more and more challenging. The thing I liked the most about this game is that in a certain way it feels like a tycoon sim, you don't have money per se but every week you survive in the game grants you new resources for you to allocate as you wish. Overall a very good game, definitely recommend it.			"

So now I get to make my own lines and help folks on their way to work, museums, or a restaurant. It feels very therapeutic coming up with a better strategy for every playthough; such as re-routing and upgrading the lines.Pick this up if you want a challenging but relaxing casual game to mess around in.You won't be disappointed.

I believe the £6.25 (It was on a 10% sale) price tag is more than reasonable for this game due to its numerous game-modes and very nice and clean art scheme. I feel this is a game has the beauty of anyone being able to pick it up and I think that if you are looking for a simple strategy game or a cheap game to pass the time, I would highly recommend it! :D			"

								What a nice, minimalistic, and addictive casual game!This game is all about building a metro railway system and keeping it working without any station becoming overcrowded. As more stations appear on the map, it's your job to connect them with lines, add more carriages, locomotives and tuinnels as needed. All the time, you'll be short of resources - so it's about allocations the resources wisely and keeping your system working as long a possible. In the first few minutes, this is quite easy, but will get quite hard very soon.Thus game is almost perfect in its minimalistic gameplay and graphics. A good game for a short break from work or for tinkering late at night (using the eye-friendly night color scheme).			"

								I don't know why, but I just love games about making dots move on lines. I own many such games and Mini Metro is the one best right now. The dots on these lines come in different shapes, which is exciting, and the lines can be controlled entirely by the player, with some restrictions. Seeing your dots move efficiently rather than piling up is very gratifying.What makes this game particularly clever, in the dots-on-lines genre, is that the dots represent passengers and the lines connect between stations on real world city geographies. The game can be very challenging, but in a very fun sort of way. There are decisions to make along the way and I feel like these are very important decisions. Don't forget you can always remove and rebuild lines when you find yourself struggling. What was most efficient at the start of the game may not be the most efficient halfway through.I would recommend this game. There are bugs, and it's Early Access, but it's fun.			"

								Awesome game.  Mini Metro is a really fun minimalistic game.  The drag and drop controls are intuitive and the menus are extremely easy to navigate.  The only downside to this game is the lack of music, however you can easily fix this by playing a relaxed music playlist in the background.  Great game and I can't wait for music to be in game.			"

								When I first got Mini Metro it was in very early stages of the game and ever since then it has kept on improving. It used to be just trains, lines and tunnels but now you can use faster trains and the new interchanges. Overall, it can get quite boring playing it over and over again but it is a unique and challenging indie that is well worth buying.			"

								This is a game that I will play for the rest of my life. I really love the originality and simplicity of the concept. The user interface is nice. If I were to mention any complaint it would only be that a few of the updates seem to be a step in the wrong direction, although they don't ruin the playability of the game. It's not critical, but I would like to see some sort of multi-player in the future and am expecting the achievements to develop as the game moves along. Thank you, makers of this wonderful subway management game.			"

								This game isn't so much a transportation network simulation as it is a subtle puzzle game. The key to sucess is to not overload your lines with the same symbols next to each other because that will cause stations to be backed up. Make sure to stagger the symbols! (triangle-circle-triangle is good, triangle-triangle-circle is bad.) This is easier said than done because many times you will have no choice but to have four circles in a row on one line.The second secret is always retool your lines as you play the level. More stations are added as the game plays out, and you will find what worked for the first 300 passengers all of a sudden isn't as efficient and you have to clear the lines and re-lay them out for the next 300.There's a lot of strategy in this game, from how you lay out the map to what bonuses you get every level. I've just sat here and played through all levels for the past five hours and even went back and replayed a couple of early levels that I didn't do so well because I hadn't figured out the system yet. This is a fun game!This game is low on flash and high on substance, it's a must have for anyone who loves puzzle strategy games!			"

								I don't know why, but I just love games about making dots move on lines. I own many such games and Mini Metro is the one best right now. The dots on these lines come in different shapes, which is exciting, and the lines can be controlled entirely by the player, with some restrictions. Seeing your dots move efficiently rather than piling up is very gratifying.What makes this game particularly clever, in the dots-on-lines genre, is that the dots represent passengers and the lines connect between stations on real world city geographies. The game can be very challenging, but in a very fun sort of way. There are decisions to make along the way and I feel like these are very important decisions. Don't forget you can always remove and rebuild lines when you find yourself struggling. What was most efficient at the start of the game may not be the most efficient halfway through.I would recommend this game. There are bugs, and it's Early Access, but it's fun.			"

								This game is one of my favorite casual games, even if it's only in beta. The updates to the beta have been fantastic and regular, and every time I turn around they're adding something that makes this game worth coming back to. If you like casual puzzle games and/or sims (depending on how you look at it) this game is totally worth it. I've played through evey city at least once on every mode, and I've come back multiple times to replay when the layout has been redesigned or they've added new features and such -- and it just keeps getting better and better, without getting (noticeably) more complex to play.

												Bought this game in early access and since then it's gone from strength to strength. It's so beautifully minimalistic but with a lot of depth to it. It's possibly one of the best puzzle games I have ever played and continue to enjoy. With leaderboards, daily maps that you can only play once (making them frustratingly difficult), and steam achievements, the amount of gameplay you get for your money is astounding. Every choice that you make in this game seems to be huge; One wrong decision can render your game over. This makes the game frustrating but hugely addictive. Would definately recommend to anyone.

												The minimalist design is really beautiful, and the simple gameplay lends itself to trying a lot of strategies. Stations are represented as one of a number of shapes with passengers looking to be routed to a different shape, so lines need to be designed to effectively carry people around the network. This abstraction nicely mirrors the real world, with circles equivalent to commuter stops, squares as central hubs, and unique shapes representing individual points of interest. Somehow this game succeeds at being simultaneously relaxing and stressful as hell.			"

It is similar to those air-traffic control games, and if you like those you'll like this, but it's definitely different enough to be its own thing. It's still in progress (there's no sound yet, for instance) but even as it is it has a level of polish that some fully released games don't have.			"

								A really fun game you would expect on mobile devices but actually runs on windows/mac computers.It is so simple to understand what to do, yet to get a good score you need to manage all your resources and build your map style metro systems in just the right way to keep the city moving. If you let a station overcrowd though, it is game over.If you want lots of content for your money, I wouldn't buy this game as it doesn't have too much content yet, but what do you expect from an early access game. And still, it is only € 6,99 (do your conversion to $ or £ yourself).I'd recommend this game if you want to play a game when you are bored, at work or at school, or just at home.Quick note for the devs: It might just be the crappy mac I am on, but the game seems to lag a bit on highest speed in the end game on the efficiency gamemode (infinite time)			"

								Mini Metro is a strategy game with a very minimalistic interface and set of rules.You're a designer of a city's subway lines, and you have to keep passengers flowing through stations as they continue to pop up all over a city. Every week, you earn an additional train engine and one of two items, that could be an additional car (holds more passengers), a tunnel to navigate through waterways, a new line (with a maximum number allowed per city).The object is to move as many passengers as possible, without letting any passenger wait at a station for too long.Though still not ready for prime time, what is in the game is well-built and very challenging. The best laid plans constantly need to be changed to fit around passenger needs. You can't rest while the city grows around you.If you're a fan of train, simulation or strategy games, I highly recommend this title. If you just want a casual challenge and like minimalism, I would also recommend this game. Try it out.			"

								Brilliant puzzle game - great fun. Very well made, in terms of functionality, and it's incredibly simple to get going from the off; no instructions necessary, and you'll quickly begin joining the dots (almost literally). The UI is basic, clean and pleasant, which helps to keep the game simple. Definitely worth the £4.99 price tag.Only gripes are that there is no audio (yet), however this is being worked on, and also it would be nice to be able to zoom in and out of maps.			"

												You know, it's a  game with a simple premisse... Yes, but it`s fun, really enjoyable, and kind of hard to be honest. I mean, I never fully got the right way to construct my lines, and after 4 or 5 lines it gets really hard to not lose it.But I love how they made a puzzle game with a premisse of ~metro system constructed~ and the possibility of saving gifs of how you built the lines it`s really cool.I would say 10/10 and for this price it`s almost the best you could get.

												Mini Metro likely gets missed by people who think it's not quite a transport management game, and not quite a puzzle game. When it's actually a sweet spot right in the middle. I quite enjoy playing the daily challenge with a cup of tea. For me, this fits nicely into that, ""I have 20 minutes and just want to relax and play a bit of something good..."" niche.			"

								This might be the most satisfying puzzle game you'll ever play. Particularly if you've ever lived in a place where being able to navigate a complex subway or rail system was an important part of your life, you own it to yourself to pick this up and spend some time with it. The rules are simple, intuitive. You can learn to play in 5 minutes. The resulting strategy is complex and rewarding. It's a game that feels both abstract and practical. This sat in my wishlist for months because of it's early access status. Having bought and played it, I can say it's extremely playable in it's current state. If it wasn't missing the audio you'd never guess it wasn't completely finished.			"

								What a nice, minimalistic, and addictive casual game!This game is all about building a metro railway system and keeping it working without any station becoming overcrowded. As more stations appear on the map, it's your job to connect them with lines, add more carriages, locomotives and tuinnels as needed. All the time, you'll be short of resources - so it's about allocations the resources wisely and keeping your system working as long a possible. In the first few minutes, this is quite easy, but will get quite hard very soon.Thus game is almost perfect in its minimalistic gameplay and graphics. A good game for a short break from work or for tinkering late at night (using the eye-friendly night color scheme).			"

								A relaxed but hectic game is a good description. It's relaxing to play the game, true, with its now-existant soundscaping that really is quite lovely and relaxing, its pretty, smooth lines, and the constant motion of the subway cars. The whole setup is calm and relaxing.However, the game's pace quickly becomes frantic, a race against the clock. You WILL lose. The only question is of how quickly you will do so. It's a nice game to play in short periods of time between doing work things, or when you simply need to wind down, but it is genuinely challenging when it wants to be. I like that.			"

								It's amazing how absorbing drawling lines on a screen can be. I was uncertain on whether to buy this game or not, but I'm glad I did. As someone who always looks for different and easier routes to football matches in the UK, I've become a bit of a geek for stuff like this. Mini Metro is a really simple but also challenging strategy game. One of those that's easy to play but hard to master.For those people like me who're always complaining about where real-life trainlines start and end, it's an opportunity to do it all your way.I'd personally love to see a second release making use of DLCs to include countries, possibly even regions of certain countries. Heaven knows Lincolnshire's trainlines need sorting!			"

								I was confused when I first opened the game, there's no initial tutorial but it's fairly intuitive. I saw this critique before and I think it bears repeating, sometimes the same generation creates the same shape in a cluster which creates more back up than beneficial to the game. There's a high number of circle locations that appear and few squares that are generated which makes it incredibly difficult to make an effective line if i'm connecting a string of circle stations together. I'd like to see the station generation balanced a bit differently from where it currently is. I've enjoyed the game as a calming puzzle, it's relaxing with the limited color pallet and the clean design. I've already recommended it to people.I look forward to seeing this game completed and how things might be tweaked from early access to full release.			"

												I have played very little of this game (to date), but it has been sat on my Wishlist for 2 years, and I have known about it since just after the idea for Mini Metro was conceived.First of all, go buy this game.It is incredibly cheap for infinite amount of fun. It's like the PC equivalent of a good mobile game. No wait-timers. No microtransactions. Nothing fiddly. Just a simple concept, that is executed to perfection.I would however, recommend having something else to do whilst you play. Maybe watch Netflix. Maybe have Sky Go on in the background. Maybe listen to a podcast. Maybe watch some YouTube! Maybe buy all your friends copies of this fantastic little game.The reason I say it's fantastic and that everyone should buy it, is because I believe everyone could get something out of this. Whether it be a way to relax, a fun puzzle game, an intense management game, or a way to kill time, I think anyone and everyone can, and should, get some enjoyment from this wonderful little ball of trains.

												Simple: Draw metro tracks and choose how many trains go to each. No budgets, no construction time, etc.Calming: In normal mode, you lose once the metro stations start getting backed up. This prevents the game from getting hectic which makes it a nice game for destressing. It also has a minimalist interface with a calm sound scheme.Complex: While you could play it as a casual game, it's not merely a ""casual"" game. When I first started, I played it like a casual game. ""New station pops up? I'll connect the nearest metro line to it. It'd look a lot prettier if the line was more symmetrical."" You can do that, but you score in the bottom 25%. Then I realized, there is actually a ton of strategic depth to this game despite its casual appearance. Each time I play I realize new strategic factors in things that seemed like they didn't matter before. Now I'm in the top 10%. So, I think it's fair to saying it's more than a casual game. You can play it ""casually"" but you can also play it ""seriously"", analyzing every tiny detail.			"

												Quite possible one of the best small strategy games I've ever played, this beautiful and almost calming game seems to never get boring. With its modern, simplistic gameplay, you create subway lines in different cities around the world, and while doing that, also create music with the tracks, trains, and passengers on your metro lines. This game achieves what so many other, minimalistic games fail at: Staying fun and engaging while at the same time keeping true to the core idea of the game. This game is simple to learn, yet challenging enough to keep me coming back for more. I love it!			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this on a whim during the Steam summer sale because I was intrigued. The simplistic gameplay couldn't possibly appeal to someone who is so easily taken in by massive, engaging worlds in RPG games, right? Wrong. I need to do my homework for grad school, but the random little shapes of Paris obviously need me to provide their transportation to a matching shape!Sarcasm aside, I actually am greatly enjoying this game. I know it's in Beta, and accepted that when I made the decision to purchase, so I understand glitches and bumpiness and all that. I do think it would be nice to have a full system remap available, *including* interchanges. I can delete all the lines and recall all the bridges and tunnels, carriages, and locomotices, so even just including interchanges in that would work for me.The game lags a lot when I get far enough in, but this is also understandable because it's in Beta AND I'm running it on a low-spec machine. I'm surprised this thing can run games at all, actually.Looking forward to getting audio in it!			"

								That feeling during Tetris when the bricks are stacked too high and you're scrambling to reduce the pack before it reaches the ceiling and becomes GAME OVER.That feeling is what makes Mini Metro a great game.Every game starts out incredibly simple, but very quickly begins to spiral out of control.Amazing puzzle game with no tangible solution or result.Just a struggle against the pressure of more passengers and more stations, with not enough trains, capacity or train lines.Eventually, you fail. A station somewhere explodes from overcapacity.Restart/Continue/Quit appear on screen.You press continue...And the game keeps going. With the same map.Exactly where you failed.Except now, you can focus on improving efficiency, with no fear of failure.Different locations provide varying parameters for the game experience. Hong Kong has interchanges, Paris generates more bridges, Osoka has bullet trains.Endless mode lets you jump straight into the efficiency drive, just connecting stations between lines with not much pressure.Extreme mode challenges the player with one slight, realisitic modification. Every track is permanent. Pressure overload.Very easy game to jump in to and enjoy. Difficult game to master.One of my top 10 games of 2015 so far.PROS:Simple game mechanicsWonderful display and designTension, oh boy, that tensionVariety of modes/locationsCONS:No audio (yet)Can complete all the areas and modes in a few hours8/10			"

												Architects don't think this is realistic (at least the ones I asked).Graph theoreticians don't appreciate the UI (at least the ones I know).Puzzlers range (at least the ones I watched) about some minor AI flaws (no one would notice in endless mode).So this doesn't suit as planing tool, it's not built to teach graph theory and the first idea in development was certainly not to have a competitive high-score.Why the recommendation? Because as a game it's awesome! The GUI is incredibly simple and intuitive. I tested it on people who aren't familiar with computers and they mastered the interface within a couple of minutes without help. I tried this game on people who like casual games, and they became addicted.This game shows how much potential a few abstract symbols can have. It doesn't have much features, but the they are well used. I rarely try puzzles more than three times in a row, though here I don't seem to mind it at all - each time really feels different.			"

												For such a simple game, there is a lot of strategy packed into it. Minimalistic graphics prevent distractions from the real purpose of the game: create a subway layout that is efficient. Using only the three starting lines, you must adapt and quickly change based on where new stops open up. Easy to play, difficult to master. I like becauseupon opening the game for the first time, it puts you in control immediately. You must learn on the go. If you want easy to win, this isn't for you. While challenging, it is simple enough that anyone can pick it up in the matter of a few minutes.			"

This makes it awkward as if you need to change something in the settings you have to quit and you lose your progress, so maybe progress should be able to be saved or have options accessible in game. Overall, however, the game runs brilliantly, so overall i would rate it 9/10.			"

The game is simple, intuitive, and excellent value.

								Mini metro is a simple yet challenging puzzle game that's best played in short, half hour bursts. It's good value for money if you enjoy exploring the different ways you can try to play the game and make your own strategy... It can be addicting at times! The only fault I can find is that it may be too simple for a few people, but that's about it.What I best like about the game: How the simplicity of the game means anyone can make their own strategy and experement. The UI is easy to navigate, and I like how the game was designed to resemble an actual tube map - the simple colors with the shapes and white background make it look clean and bold.What would make this game better: More game modes would be a nice thing to add. Maybe a few new upgrades (though its true this may fall in the danger of making the game too complex). Making each map more unique (for example changing the design of a locomotive for each map)Overall: 9/10. Simple, fun and addicting.			"

								It's a pure strategy title and by fully embracing their limits it does everything right. The goal is simple, transporting little passenger blocks to their desired stations. The UI is simple, dragging subway paths along the stops and adding carts on existing lines. At the start of every week you can choose between one of two upgrades. That's basically it. The depth? Surprisingly complex. With the ever increasing number of stations that you have to connect to your network and the ability to add new lines, the game gets ever more challenging. To solve this you can choose many different strategies, and even derive from real world subways. Star shaped, circle, checkerboard? Everything is possible (though not always efficient).The game is still in development and lacks certain important features, such as sound. If you don't mind you should buy it right now! Otherwise it is planned to be released in November 2014.			"

												In short, probably the best game you will ever play about drawing lines to get that circle to the square.Mini Metro is an action puzzle game. Probably the closest comparison to it is the amazing Trauma Centre.I have been playing this game since the late stages of its early access. Unlike most early access games, it was playable and fun from an early stage. It didn't have music for the longest time, and honestly, probably still doesn't need it, although it does add to the experience.Oh, and in case you care, it does the daily challenge thing every indie game does now.

								This is a very fun little RTS/puzzle/sim/whatever game.  It's very simple and great if you just need to kill a few minutes, but it also feels surprisingly deep.  I've done very well on most of the leaderboards, but I still feel like I'm only just starting to grasp the strategy of it.  It's well worth the 7 bucks if you like games like this.  (Although, I honestly can't think of very many games quite like this.)  Just make sure to bring your own music, because as of writing this, there is still none in the game.			"

								I started playing this game back when the beta number was in the single digits, and I have been very happy with how the development has progressed. The more recent changes (individualized cities being a huge change for the better) have been great without changing the game from its core.You lead the development of a single city's subway infrastructure to transport its citizens (circles, squares, triangles, and the like) to their desired station. Play starts off slowly, with passengers spawning quite slowly and you having a ton of resources at your disposal. Play difficulty (on the standard settings) quickly ramps up through the weeks to the point where you are just hanging on to your non-crowded stations...or you just lose because four stations go over the edge.You can also take the relaxing, almost theraputic route where you go for system efficiency. In this case, your upgrades come after reaching efficiency milestones instead of each week, but the goal is more relaxing to obtain.I'm looking forard to the soon-to-be-included soundtrack, which will finally make this a complete game (as much as I did like listening to movie soundtracks while playing).

Early Access Review
								Mini Metro is amazing value for money, for me at least. I have played 15+ hours so far and this game does something that not many other early access games do for me, it keeps bringing me back to see what’s new every month. It’s great for podcasts or just being in the background while you do something else in endless mode and also great if you want to really knuckle down and strategize. The art style is ok, nothing unique for a minimalistic game, but definitely not dull. The is no music and it has been promised since the game came out. To be honest, my play time will probably double with an amazing soundtrack. The leaderboard aspect of the game is great, should be a standard in most games in my opinion. The unlock system is actually pretty cool, they use the same formula for each tier of unlock, but the fact the dev realises the difficulty level of each map by the amount of things you have to accomplish really shows how much testing has happened behind the scenes and how much they pay attention to the data and the community which is refreshing to say the least nowadays. So I’m going to give this game a 7/10 purely because lack of music, otherwise a solid 9/10.			"

For example, what is an Interchange do exactly?- Seems to be a bit imbalanced in generation of riders, piling onto one stop while leaving others vacant withoutrhyme or reason.- Ridership ramps up a bit suddenly around week 9, not clear why- Not clear what the efficiency mode/score is.- Needs a quicker way to exit from the game.

								Each playthrough starts out perfectly innocently.  It's reassuring.  Almost boring.  A little voice in the back of my head tells me that I'm laying foundations for what will come next, and that it's important to get this right, but the ease of redesigning my entire system at this point in the game tells me that the voice is lying.  The week ends, I get a new locomotive, and choose one of options to go with it.Somehow, by week five, my nice, neat train system has started to turn into a spider's-web of cross-connections and long loops.  I need to add a new station to the main loop, which means disconnecting three stations, then reconnecting them in a different sequence.  Of course, now that I've done that, it should reduce the pressure on that line and mean that I'm dropping passengers off more often, which should improve the overall capacity.  Unfortunately, I didn't notice a new station opening up on the other side of the map, and it's critically overcrowded.  Game over.Mini Metro is a roguelike action-puzzle game where the central mechanic is designing a train network.  It's trickier than it looks, and if it gets its strangely compelling hooks into you, it may drive you insane.  Enough time wasted - I need to fire it back up and see if I can work out a better way of dealing with those annoying suburban regions where nobody wants to get off, and everybody wants to get on....

								Mini Metro is something special. It's ostentatiously a minimalist route optimisation game, but it's much more sinister.Set in what can only be a post scarcity technological singularity, stations are created in days without prior permission, and with arbitrary locations, and you must optimise train routes to shuttle the lumbering masses of humanity towards their destination no matter what, lest your train station spontaneously combust from the irate hordes. Yet these routes don't take years to construct, mere hours in fact. Tonnes and tonnes of rail and infrastructure put into place with scant regard for whoever lives in its way. Yet your advancement depends on either your efficiency or number of passengers delivered - a brutal commentary on the dog eat dog world we live in today.Truly, Mini Metro can be descrived as a deconstructive commentary of our modern living.

								You like puzzle games, subway systems, somewhat calming games or a combination of the three?

I'd say it's even worth getting now, even in its Early Access state (a good chunk of content and music is not there yet), especially considering how cheap it is.			"

												Easily one of my favourite puzzle games.  The game's focus on efficiency goes beyond the gameplay itself with a minimalist, unobtrusive UI that provides a maximum of information and means of control with a minimum of clutter. The ""Classic Underground Map"" aesthetic is carried off perfectly by the developers, with plenty of thought evidently going into even seemingly minor points such as the colour palette used for different subway lines. With new maps and new challenges facing players after each patch, the game has excellent replay value.Continuing on the theme of efficiency, the game is also a compact one, weighing in at 200MB of disk space. It is also well-optimised, allowing even weaker, older systems to run the game with acceptable framerates and without any serious reliability issues. Multiple-OS compatibility is also a pleasant plus.Recommended even at its standard price, this game offers excellent value for money when it is on sale.			"

												I wish ratings were more of a yes/no but I just can't recommend this game if you are looking for a transport simThat being said, Mini Metro is beautiful, simple graphics resemble infographics... generated music depending on what is happening in the game leads to a very pleasant initial experience...but once you start playing the game you start realizing where Mini Metro doesn't quite make it...things like dots just want to go to the nearest station with the appropriate shape which doesn't really make any sense in a simulation... dots will never go ""cross town""... if it weren't for ""special"" stations I don't think you would even have to connect your lines together if laid out properlythe stations seem to appear completely randomly, sometimes making efficient motion easy, sometimes making it virtually impossible...populations will sometimes rise steadily, or sometimes simply explode leading to a quick, unavoidable failure...reinforcements are just based on time (one in game week) and are too few and far between... the efficiency mode is much nicer but that will eventually max out and then you have essentially just run out of game...I hope the developer continues to work on this game since I really do love what they have so far, it just needs some tweaking			"

								There's something inherently calming about joining the dots and creating order - and Mini Metro capitalises on this beautifully. Gorgeous, minimal and uncluttered design, lovely bright colours and simple shapes are the order of the day. Shaped stations pop up on the white landscape, requiring you to join them together with lines. As you do, passengers appear at them, demanding to get to other stations.The system that deals with moving passengers about, especially when to and when not to pick them up and which interchanges to drop them at seems, even in this 'early access' build, to be flawless. Short of the missing sound and music (which I can't wait for) and the so-called Scenic and Rush Hour modes (which seem to be Zen and Extreme in the version I have here) this is already a fantastic little game. Bonus points for having a night mode as well.For fear of cluttering up the minimalism I'd like to be able to name stops  for my own reference or just for fun, but otherwise, I can't wait for the last finishing touches.

								I can't wait for Scenic mode! So much fun, and so terrifying watching the station fill up. Panic begins to set in as the clock ticks upwards towards failure, and suddenly the week ends and you decide to add as many locomotives and carriages as possible to that one station without realizing seven other stations are suffering a similar fate. You fail, yet again.			"

Early Access Review
								$7 might seem like much for what is practically a iOS game, but the dedication and constant updates from the developer really make this a game to try out. Even The Walking Dead was ported to mobile, so it's not like this game doesn't have a place here. Mini Metro allows you to run your own metro system on minimalistic maps based on real cities such as London, Paris, and New York City. It's really just a drag-and-drop formula, but the more you play the more challenging it gets. The game doesn't end until your metro gets overcrowded and shut down, but this can even take a while for the simpliest of simpletons. Not even an hour in and I could feel the potential this game has. Pros (because a lot of people enjoy that):-The most casual, yet fun gameplay-Variety of cities and maps to play on-Leaderboards to make you feel bad as a beginner-Both Night mode and Colorblind mode for visually impaired people sneaking on their PCs at midnight-Fairly open settings (Graphics, resolution, etc.)-Cities in Motion 2 for people like me who can't run Cities in Motion 2Cons:-The most casual, yet simple gameplay-No music (as of August 21, 2014 [8/21/14])-No train bombing scenarios-No inspirational get-man-out-of-train-tracks scenarios-No scenarios "

								A game with great potential.Well I would say that, presently speaking, this game is kinda boring actually. Controls are simple, just use your mouse to draw line between dots (representing stations). If any station gets overcrowded you lose the game. It's really about planning lines ONLY, unlike other sim games like SimCity of Cities in Motion where you can choose to place your own stations within the city. (In this game there is no image of the city AT ALL.) Here you dont get to choose where you build your stations. They pop-up randomly.  DO NOT buy this game and think that you're playing SimCity.  If the developer manages to add-in some other modes (like sandbox, where there is no ending with overcrowding), the game can be a great time-killer.It's a 2-D game so great for low-end PCs.I would give it thumbs up just for the possibility of future development.

								Very fun puzzle game that represents a masterpiece of simplicity.It provides a very cerebral challange because there are so many possibilities and strategies, and all of them have advantages and disadvantages. You find yourself constantly trying to figure out the best way of planning. There is a great deal of strategy for such a simple concept.Not yet fully developed, but even in its current state it's fantastic. At present, there is no music and are no win conditions, but if you put on your own music it can be such a cozy atmosphere, and the lack of win condition, similar to tetris (it just gets harder and harder until you lose), provides a really addictive need to create an even better system. Simple to play, difficult to master, impossible to put down. Can't wait to see the final product.			"

								A classic game in the making. Having played only an hour and a half at the moment I can see myself loosing much more time to this game. While the lack of music is sad, being Early Access, I can't wait for the soundtrack to be added on. All in all, this is no train sim, it is a frustratingly fun strategists dream which challenges your abilities each time you play through and there is no forgiveness for even the slightest oversight. That being said, I would have liked a little tutorial that would have explained that when a new station appears on an existing line it becomes a place where trains blissfully roll by. Therefore, you must either redraw the entire line to include the new station or add it to another line. Graphically, the simplistic design is really quite beautiful and as time goes on you start to admire the mess of lines that begin to splay out as you try to balance length of lines and coverage. All in all, a great game and I highly recommend picking this game up while it is at a very reasonable price. On a lighter note, I now take my hat off to every Transport Minister past and present.

												This  game has that simplicity and addictive ""I'll play just one more"" nature to it that all the classics (Tetris, Angry Birds, etc.). When you first run the game, you think it is doing a tutorial, and you are right, but then you realize you have also actually started your first real game. The learning curve is gradual and fun as the first game you play teaches you how to play. I have only played the London map so far, and I feel like I could play it over and over and try different techniques to figure out the best strategies--I cannot imagine how much more fun this will be when I try the other maps like Paris and Berlin.The user interface is clean and fun to look at--it uses the actual metro symbology of simple lines and colors and connectors to actually provide the graphics for the game and interface, all in one. Genius decision. As an added perk, you can save your games after you finish as screenshots and animated GIFs! Such a fun game!Some might critidize the lack of multiplayer, but as quick as the games are, you could make it multi by challenging a friend to the same map and watching them play. Even watching a game is mesmerizing!UPDATE AFTER 9 HOURS OF PLAYThis game is so awesome. I come back to it almost every day and play a round or two. I am trying not to go on to the next map until I have done 1,000 passengers...but this broke down when I hit Hong Kong, where I cannot get more than 500 or so. So hard! I went ahead and went on and lowered my standard to 500+ passengers per map before I go on, and so far I can hit 1,000 passengers on all of them up to Osaka, which I just played today--Osaka, which has a really fast train engine on it! I did not know this game had different engines later in the maps! This made an already addictive, fun, challenging, innovative, elegant game that much better! So good. When this comes out on Android, I will buy it again so I can play on my phone and tablet!			"

												[EDITED]Good puzzle game in which each level progessively gets harder. Like 'old school' games where you don't beat the level, rather you keep on playing to get as high a score as possible. It would be easy to think that the levels are 'samey' but I feel they're different enough for each level to have it's own challenge, have their own aesthetic and even come to have a favourite level.I would say that, personally, the background audio needs some working on as after you've lost a level it can loop on an uncomfortable pitch and won't change once you've started a new level.

								Mini Metro takes a basic premise of connecting the dots to create a unique and challenging game. Simple concepts quickly become chaotic as the player rushes to create an efficient train route yet still encompass a large number of stops. The simple graphics are easy to follow as the game becomes more and more hectic yet still provide a wide number of information to the player. While unfinished, this game has found a great start and a permanent place in my games library. Hopefully, some audio will be added; for such a game, I believe a simple audio track much alike white noise would be perfect in creating a calming atmosphere. Definitely consider this game, it is truly a work of art and I have very high hopes for future releases.			"

It's one of those rare ones that can be picked up whenever you just have a little time and quickly played as well as when you have lots of time to beat a high score ;). The game is simple to comprehend but has extreme depth and requires a lot of foresight when planning routes (or the will to reorganize your whole network if things start to get ugly later).The moment I saw the first screenshots of this game I knew I needed to have it - lucky for us all it turned out that the creators knew how to deliver a great implementation, too!

A simple concept executed well...'Take passengers from one station to another before stations overcrowd and shut down' sounds so simple.  Add in the different shapes (types of passenger) and per-city limitations on the number of lines, trains, carriages and tunnels - and suddenly a simple concept becomes a very tactical strategy puzzle.The Steam Achievements have been well thought out - the first tier are pretty easy (Deliver X passengers in Y), the second tier vary from moderate to fiendish (for example, ""Deliver 1500 passengers in Auckland using no more than two tunnels"" has a 0.3% success rate so far) and will certainly result in some frustration... before you start another game anyway!It's a game that can be played for 15 minutes, or for a few hours at a time.  As well as the normal game mode, the endless mode allows you to focus on optimal configurations (as stations cannot overcrowd) and the extreme mode forces you to think even further ahead as you cannot revert changes!The random nature of each game is a mixed blessing - it provides replay value but occasionally will give you games that are frustratingly difficult (such as large clusters of circle stations together).  Thankfully those levels can be predicted early on so you can abandon them and start again if you wish.£6.99 / €9.99 / $9.99 might be towards the top end of pricing for a game such as this, but it offers considerable replay value.  Additionally, the developer provides a link to his Trello board in the news updates, which provides insight into what new features may be coming in the future.			"

												This game is pretty fun, If you really like subways or HRT maps you will probably enjoy this. It is important to note that this game is not like a tycoon where you upgrade and build things where you want. Instead you are forced to make the most strategic routes for your shapes. Also Game durations are short (5-15mins). However, there is a god like mode where there is no time limit. Because the game is so short, there is an emphasis on your score which you can compare to others and friends. The problem with this game is it can be repetitive after a while. It's worth 5$ - 10$ USD in my opinion.			"

												Graphics: Mini Metro is a very minimalistic game, and the visuals are pleasing to look at. The game is not taxing at all, as a result of the simple appearance.

Unfortunately, the music can get very repetitive, but the sound effects are great.Gameplay: The gameplay is quite simple, but enjoyable nonetheless. The different levels don't add a huge amount of variation to the gameplay, but there are some different details to spice things up. This is a puzzle game at heart, but it can be played very casually, and it's nice just to have something simple to click on to pass some time.TL;DR: This is a great and simple little game that's excellent for playing casually, especially if it can be found at a low price.

I was immediately sucked in and spent a few hours playing between the different cities; but you can also just bring up a quick round during a break (and if your break isn't long enough, there IS a pause button!).

								Was suggested this game by a friend, read the reviews and thought wow only 2 bad reviews...I'll check it out!Mini Metro is a game that completely changes after the first 10 minutes of playing through.  At first I thought  yeah this is easy, but as the level of difficulty increases you find yourself racking your brain hoping for the next upgrade the come round.  Graphics are simple and pleasing to watch, Its nice not to have a overly cluttered UI.Cant wait for more maps!!			"

								If you're looking for a difficult-to-master strategy game, this is pretty solid. If, however, you're looking for a mass transit sim ... this is not it. Once you figure out key elements of maximizing efficiency, you begin to realize that the real-world logic behind the layout of the world's metros need not apply. Thinking of a radial design enclosed by a circle line? It'll only last if the sequence of shapes makes sense. Ultimately that's where the game lost its 'sim' appeal for me. Nevertheless it's a satisfying puzzler that can embrace many different tactical approaches.			"

								Mini Metro is one of those games that you think will be easy to play and your line will thrive. Although it soon becomes apparent that the task is huge. Each new station that appears, is another problem you have to deal with. You have to manage your resources well to keep your line open. At the end of each round you recieve bonuses like a new train, an additional line or carriage. You decide which, choose wisely or you may just be making your own downfall.You don't need to be a seasoned gamer to get to grasps with this amazing game. Although it's in Early Access, you can see how the game will shape and find new ways to captivate you. The recent addition of Zen Mode keeps you expanding your line for the ultimate Metro.What I love most about this game is that you can not win, only survive the hustle and bustle of the stations for as long as your, hopefully, well planned lines will allow it. The game is aesthetically pleasing - They use the classic coloured lines; like you would see on a metro map. You watch your map expand in realtime as you add more to it. How long can you survive?

								I love this game, the minimalist style is beautiful. It is well designed and unique, in my experience. However, I have a few criticisms, that i think could help improve the depth and breadth of gameplay greatly. 1. Customers using the transport system should be able to pay for its , for a price set by the player.This could generate income, too buy upgrades for the system. 2. Statistics on how each line is performing, too anticipate traffic, capacity and demand.3. Allowing for the building of more than seven lines at a time, this is an arbitrary limit with little practical use in the game.4. Enabling lines to have multiple branches that diverge and converge with eachother.5.  What about multiplayer?			"

								A surprisingly fun little time waster. Controls are easy although it took a while before I figured out how to unbind a station. Starts of with a handful of stations and grows until you have a massive mess of train lines that you are constantly looking to improve on and connect so that people are able to get from their circle station to the + sign in the far corner.I also can't help but think that this would also be a brilliant game for a tablet.

Based on the trailer, the audio seems to sound pleasant and relaxing. Hopefully the devs can keep this title on track!(soooooo sorry for ba--REALLY AWESOME pun)			"

								Very simple and addicting game, looking forward to future updates. The only thing I would like to see change in future updates would be a redistribution of the rates at which the various shapes spawn. Circles spawn so much that it makes it impossible to distribute the shapes across your lines, leading to long stretches of circles that no passengers get off at. rebalancing them with triangles/squares and increasing them turning in to stars and pentagon shapes would make the game less frustrating while not making it easier.Overall very creative and recommended!

												I don't have many hours in this game on Steam, mostly because I have it on mobile and I often play it when I'm waiting for appointments and sitting in traffic. I have, however, still played enough on Steam to know that there's no true difference between the two versions.This game is an example of a casual game done right. It's a game you can just pick up and play. You don't learn through lengthy text tutorials, but rather through visual cues and your own personal experimentation. It's fun and relaxing, but also presents a challenge. Its difficulty scales over time, and eventually, you will lose.This game is a must for any casual gamer, but I recommend it to gamers of any description. Everyone needs to relax sometimes - even the most hardcore gamer. It's like having a little sand garden on your desk, but with a really chill soundtrack accompanying it.			"

												Great game, I can sum it up in two words if you don't want to read the entire review, relaxing funBut here's the long version of it, this game already is fine just from the relaxing music in the backround, it gives you a calm enviorment to take your mind off of any other games that are competative or otherwise multiplayer. This game is just you, and a fun puzzle stratagy game. If you are that competative you can compare scores but its very calm and doesn't have any stress. This game has lots of maps and modes and is a real challenge to play. If you don't want to deal with losing by a station being full you can go into endless mode where you can't lose. Or if you want a challenge you can do expert mode where you can't replace track once you place it. Or you can just do classic normal mode. Either way you play it is a fun game and is great. I know I will play this game for a long time			"

								Pros: Simply addicitve and stright forward fun. I.E. Rubix cube, Tetris, Sokoban and MIni Metro. I'm always working toward beating my own scores. Even got friends interested in it. Cons: I have latency or memory leak in the scenic mode when I get to about 60 passengers. Odd this doesn't occur even on commuter mode with 900 passengers. Hopefully there is a fix in place for this one day.Sidebar: Maybe we can have an emergency bus route we can use once a day for ""emergency"" situations?

								This is, hands-down, the finest first-play experience I have ever had from a casual game.  Mini Metro is an outstanding example of perfection in minimalism, and a resounding lesson that gameplay trumps all.  As of this date, there is no music, and the graphics are simple transit system line art.  In short, you could have knocked this out on a VIC-20 in your basement-- if you'd been this much of a genius.The concept is brilliant, and the execution is perfect-- but this is still early access at this point, so there's a bit of a level shortage.  That's alleviated somewhat by the several subtly-- but importantly-- different play modes.Also, there are not a lot of upgrades at this point.  There are only three or four limited, important resources, and they're all really major.  A handful of more subtle, minor-tweak upgrades would make things a bit more visually interesting, as well as giving you a few things to tinker with when you're waiting to see how well a major change plays out.Nonetheless, this is absolutely the best casual game I've played in years.  Highly recommended, and definitely worth the money.  The only real question is whether you will also want it on your phone or tablet, where I expect touch-and-drag would only add to the fun.			"

								A really fun game you would expect on mobile devices but actually runs on windows/mac computers.It is so simple to understand what to do, yet to get a good score you need to manage all your resources and build your map style metro systems in just the right way to keep the city moving. If you let a station overcrowd though, it is game over.If you want lots of content for your money, I wouldn't buy this game as it doesn't have too much content yet, but what do you expect from an early access game. And still, it is only € 6,99 (do your conversion to $ or £ yourself).I'd recommend this game if you want to play a game when you are bored, at work or at school, or just at home.Quick note for the devs: It might just be the crappy mac I am on, but the game seems to lag a bit on highest speed in the end game on the efficiency gamemode (infinite time)			"

								$7 might seem like much for what is practically a iOS game, but the dedication and constant updates from the developer really make this a game to try out. Even The Walking Dead was ported to mobile, so it's not like this game doesn't have a place here. Mini Metro allows you to run your own metro system on minimalistic maps based on real cities such as London, Paris, and New York City. It's really just a drag-and-drop formula, but the more you play the more challenging it gets. The game doesn't end until your metro gets overcrowded and shut down, but this can even take a while for the simpliest of simpletons. Not even an hour in and I could feel the potential this game has. Pros (because a lot of people enjoy that):-The most casual, yet fun gameplay-Variety of cities and maps to play on-Leaderboards to make you feel bad as a beginner-Both Night mode and Colorblind mode for visually impaired people sneaking on their PCs at midnight-Fairly open settings (Graphics, resolution, etc.)-Cities in Motion 2 for people like me who can't run Cities in Motion 2Cons:-The most casual, yet simple gameplay-No music (as of August 21, 2014 [8/21/14])-No train bombing scenarios-No inspirational get-man-out-of-train-tracks scenarios-No scenarios "

								A game with great potential.Well I would say that, presently speaking, this game is kinda boring actually. Controls are simple, just use your mouse to draw line between dots (representing stations). If any station gets overcrowded you lose the game. It's really about planning lines ONLY, unlike other sim games like SimCity of Cities in Motion where you can choose to place your own stations within the city. (In this game there is no image of the city AT ALL.) Here you dont get to choose where you build your stations. They pop-up randomly.  DO NOT buy this game and think that you're playing SimCity.  If the developer manages to add-in some other modes (like sandbox, where there is no ending with overcrowding), the game can be a great time-killer.It's a 2-D game so great for low-end PCs.I would give it thumbs up just for the possibility of future development.

								This is a great game. The one thing I would change is that each piece transported should pay a fare, then at the end of the week, the player should have the option to use the fare to buy a new line, a new carriage, or build a tunnel/bridge. The way it is now, it is completely random, and nothing is more frustrating than having a beautiful, efficient map, then having a station show up on an island when you don't have a tunnel, then not having a choice to build a new tunnel at the end of the week. Maybe this is the effect that the developers are going for since this is a puzzle game, but it can be pretty annoying.Also, why is Hong Kong so ♥♥♥♥ing hard????			"

Early Access Review
								Just a crazy simple, beautiful, extremely polished strategy game.Place metro lines to connect stations that randomly appear as you play.  That's basically it.  You have a limited number of lines, a limited number trains and cars to place on your lines, and a limited number of tunnels to cross water, each of which you recieve more of as you play.  You can place and delete and rearrange your lines and trains as much as you want for no cost (and there is a tactical pause).  All you have to do is keep getting polygonal people to their polygonal destinations smoothly as long as you can, while the number of stations and passengers keeps increasing.Although the game is still in early access, this is really an incredibly polished game (the only thing missing is sound, which I don't mind).  It looks clean an modern and beautiful, it has a lovely UI and menu system... it's extremely clear and easy to use.  I've spent several hours playing it so far, and I definitely intend to play more... it is a great casual game - easy to pick up, with short self-contained sessions - but it also has some real depth.  You can put a lot of thought into your metro designs, or you can just throw something down and watch what happens.  It's quite flexible in terms of ways to play.  Each map/level/city also offers unique constraints and layouts (semi randomized each time of course), and the difficulty of the levels ranges from hold-my-hand to crushingly difficult, giving you access to all of them immediately, so you can explore your ability and comfort level from the beginning, and aspire to those harder cities.The only negative thing I can think of to say about the game is that I wouldn't want to sit and play it for hours straight.  It's more of a pick-up put-down game.  Also, there is no tutorial, and while the UI is relatively straight forward, understanging the princples of the game might take you a couple minutes and/or google searches.  Hopefully a tutorial will be added soon :)Highly recommended!  I think this has a lot of appeal for a lot of different types of people.			"

								Very fun puzzle game that represents a masterpiece of simplicity.It provides a very cerebral challange because there are so many possibilities and strategies, and all of them have advantages and disadvantages. You find yourself constantly trying to figure out the best way of planning. There is a great deal of strategy for such a simple concept.Not yet fully developed, but even in its current state it's fantastic. At present, there is no music and are no win conditions, but if you put on your own music it can be such a cozy atmosphere, and the lack of win condition, similar to tetris (it just gets harder and harder until you lose), provides a really addictive need to create an even better system. Simple to play, difficult to master, impossible to put down. Can't wait to see the final product.			"

								This game is one of my favorite casual games, even if it's only in beta. The updates to the beta have been fantastic and regular, and every time I turn around they're adding something that makes this game worth coming back to. If you like casual puzzle games and/or sims (depending on how you look at it) this game is totally worth it. I've played through evey city at least once on every mode, and I've come back multiple times to replay when the layout has been redesigned or they've added new features and such -- and it just keeps getting better and better, without getting (noticeably) more complex to play.

								This game isn't so much a transportation network simulation as it is a subtle puzzle game. The key to sucess is to not overload your lines with the same symbols next to each other because that will cause stations to be backed up. Make sure to stagger the symbols! (triangle-circle-triangle is good, triangle-triangle-circle is bad.) This is easier said than done because many times you will have no choice but to have four circles in a row on one line.The second secret is always retool your lines as you play the level. More stations are added as the game plays out, and you will find what worked for the first 300 passengers all of a sudden isn't as efficient and you have to clear the lines and re-lay them out for the next 300.There's a lot of strategy in this game, from how you lay out the map to what bonuses you get every level. I've just sat here and played through all levels for the past five hours and even went back and replayed a couple of early levels that I didn't do so well because I hadn't figured out the system yet. This is a fun game!This game is low on flash and high on substance, it's a must have for anyone who loves puzzle strategy games!			"

								I haven't played Mini Metro for months. Not because I thought it was ...meh... but more because I overplayed it when I picked it up the moment it was available on Steam.Today I've played it again and I like the changes/additions to the game. One of the best additions are the (big) interexchange hubs added to the game. This way the stations 'survive' longer with the large numbers of passengers. Also the addition of achievements was very surprising.Sadly still no sound though for the game. I surely hope that'll come SOON™...			"

								This is a game that I will play for the rest of my life. I really love the originality and simplicity of the concept. The user interface is nice. If I were to mention any complaint it would only be that a few of the updates seem to be a step in the wrong direction, although they don't ruin the playability of the game. It's not critical, but I would like to see some sort of multi-player in the future and am expecting the achievements to develop as the game moves along. Thank you, makers of this wonderful subway management game.			"

								This is a great little game, a simple to learn strategy/puzzle game that has that whole ""one more go"" aspect.All you need to do is link your different stations together and make sure the stations don't get too busy.  Yes you'll earn extra trains, extra carriages and extra lines.  But the whole game still comes down to the simple goal of linking your stations together.   You start with three stations and it seems an overly easy task but as the station start to increase so too does the difficulty and you find your metro system falling apart as you try to figure out the best way to connect them all.Thankfully there's the option to hit Pause, then delete all your lines and have a wee think about a new tactic, before finding that it works even worse than your previous layout.  Lots of different maps to play on too to give a bit of variety.As it's Early Access there are some things missing, no sound for example.  But the game idea is there and works perfectly and it can already keep you coming back over and over in it's current state.  It's well worth buying, especially considering how cheap it is.			"

								The epitome of simple to learn, hard to master.  I'm usually no fan of casual games but this one has hooked me dearly. There's alot of pretty sexy, smooth details running flawlessly behind the simple facade.  Just about the only part of the game that is still at all ""early access"" is a lack of music, and I'm not sure if the game will ever get music.  If that's true, screw ""Disasterpiece."" He's had months and months to develop.  Other than music, The only weirdness is the rare odd line disconnect where it branches in a different direction at a station.Puzzle game fans and transit geeks, this game has the goods!			"

								I don't know why, but I just love games about making dots move on lines. I own many such games and Mini Metro is the one best right now. The dots on these lines come in different shapes, which is exciting, and the lines can be controlled entirely by the player, with some restrictions. Seeing your dots move efficiently rather than piling up is very gratifying.What makes this game particularly clever, in the dots-on-lines genre, is that the dots represent passengers and the lines connect between stations on real world city geographies. The game can be very challenging, but in a very fun sort of way. There are decisions to make along the way and I feel like these are very important decisions. Don't forget you can always remove and rebuild lines when you find yourself struggling. What was most efficient at the start of the game may not be the most efficient halfway through.I would recommend this game. There are bugs, and it's Early Access, but it's fun.			"

								liked it for the first 20 minutes when you're trying to decipher the game and learn it's logic...until you beat the game (which is not difficult to do), in which case your metro system will run perpetually and you're stuck watching your trains picking up passengers and dropping them off because a) you can only build 7 lines and there are no more assets available beyond the city's saturation point and b) you just don't want to close the damn thing as it's just so satisfying looking at how everything runs so smoothly in equilibriumsome possible modifications - do away with city limits and make infinite expansion possible, more bonuses beyond saturation point, variety in types and behaviours of passengers etc.looking forward to the official game			"

								I'm not usually a fan of early access games, but the minimalism present in this game really appealed to me. When I first played a couple of months ago, I was a bit disappointed with the lack of variety. There were only a couple of maps, which all played very similarly, and Rush Hour mode was not yet finished. When I started playing again recently, I was pleased with what the developers had done. More than double the maps were added, all which now play quite differently from each other, and Rush Hour mode was complete. At this point, it would seem the game is complete (minus the lack of audio), but it seems the developers still have a few things in mind.Overall the game is very easy to pick up an play. It's simple, relaxing and, despite being somewhat slow-paced, very challenging. I'm still not certain if you can actually ""win"" a game, but that doesn't keep me from trying. Highly recommended.

It's loads of fun, has tons of replay value, and quite a few different maps.			"

								Public Transport can be horrible. Especially trains. Most people say: ""I can do a much better job at that!"" Well, lets see if you canThis is a game where you control the London underground, exept it's not always in London. It could be Auckland, New York or even Paris! The developers - Dinosaur Polo - are always open for ideas, so if you don't like something (how?) it would be fixed.The controls can be a bit dodgy, removing a station for example isn't as easy as it sounds. You get upgrades every Sunday which allow you to:Add a carriage (max 3)Add a train ( max 3 I believe)Increase the amount of tunnels/bridgesAdd a line ( max 7, start with 3)and more!The game comes with 2 modes, with one coming soon:CommuterScenicRush hour (to be added)Commuter is the normal, standard, frustrating gameScenic, you can't lose. You get points by how many passengers use your metro per weekRush hour will probably be a ery intense commuter modeIn the game we have four types of stations:Circle (common)Triangle (uncommon)Square (rare)Special (very rare)Even though some are rarer then others, you will get at least one of these each game. The map is randomly generated however, so you never know where they will spawn.That should finish my review. I do reccomend this game and rating out of 100 would be:                                                                   97.5/100 "

								First and foremost, Mini Metro is one of the most minimalistic games I have ever played. Everything from the design of the menus to the actual gameplay itself is super minimalistic, which makes the game easy on the eyes and overall a relaxing experience. The game comes with 3 modes, Communter, Scenic, and Rush Hour, each with their own spin on the theme of delivering ""passengers"" to the station they would like to go to. But here is the catch, these ""passengers"" have a destination designated by a shape. That means if you have a circle passenger, and there are 3 circle stations on the map, then that passenger has 3 possible destinations. The system will obviously take the passenger on the route that is fastest to a circle station, but that makes the game not a ""one passenger-one destination"" sim, but rather a route building puzzle game.I highly recommend this for its relaxing gameplay, and would definitely recommend the game to my friends looking for a fun little casual game to burn some time on. However, if you are looking for a more hardcore simulation style transportation style game, this might not fit your expectations, but you will definitely still have fun!Good luck and game on!			"

Disclaimer: This review is for the Early Access version as of February 15, 2015. This review may be edited or deleted as Early Access progresses or when the game releases.Review: As a really young kid, I loved the New York City subway because we rode it every day, and I loved looking at the maps. Sometimes I would even draw out my own station maps for the hell of it. Mini Metro takes what I did as a kid and makes a really enthralling yet really difficult puzzle game out of it.Mini Metro starts off with giving you three stations. You have to connect subway lines between these stations to transport passengers. That's it, though. You click and drag and boom, line complete and subway moving. Soon enough, as the city grows, more and more cities will require subway service and you'll have to manage your limited number of lines as efficiently as possible. Don't forget that you're limited on the number of tunnels/bridges you can make over waterways! The puzzle gameplay is really solid - I can't say if it's unique, but it's definitely sticking out as a favorite of mine.The best part of Mini Metro is the visuals. The game almost looks exactly like the modern subway maps you see in New York City, London, etc. and the vibrant, unique colors make it easy to distinguish between lines. There's even a night mode, for anyone who would get blinded by the white backdrop.There's no audio at all, which allows you to use your favorite media player in conjunction with the game. However, procedural audio is a planned feature, so we'll see what comes of it!Honestly, this is a puzzle game that I would recommend to anyone. It's fun, it's challenging, and it's vibrant.			"

A great 15 minute or 3 hour diversion. And it looks and plays cleaner than you have ever been. Metro succesfully blends strategy and resource management into a fluid, growing, growling thing.

								Simple game with lot of fun. At some point of time you will always loose. The challenge is about transport more passengers then ever and survive as long as you can. You can already play, but as you can see by my list of (-) there is still a lot to add and do before it is a complete game.+ easy to understand+ no harm, just clever game for all ages (family)+ as the city grows, it gets complex and challenging+ simple interface- sometimes it feels like the trains (or passengers) do silly things which gets one in trouble- when re-arranging tracks and or re-arranging is done, trains just wait for some time (and looks like calculating) instead of moving on- re-arranging tracks is hard, sometimes you need to remove the whole track and re-do it from scratch- max 4 trains for one road (why to limit?)- re-arranging a railroad from a currently visited to make it unvisited by drag and drop to nowhere not possible- no long trains possible (just too little bonus of passenger train)- no big/huge railroad system possible yet- at some point it just spawns circles to end the game instead of growing balanced- no options to set up rules for own map- no sound yet			"

												This is a great game to play to relax to. The music is atmospheric and soothing. The gameplay mostly lets you watch your creation at work. The graphics are simple yet easy on the eyes.If I were to have a problem with it, it would be the fact that new stations and problem stations aren't easier to notice. The gong of a new station appearing is often lost in the hustle and bustle, and the chirp of a station being overcrowded doesn't exactly tell you where, if there are several one might get lost in the shuffle.I don't normally strive for achievements, but the ones in this game are worthy challenges if you are up to it. Many people complain about the spawns, but unless you play with the permanent tunnels option, there's nothing stopping you from redesigning and moving your trains around whenever you feel a redesign is in order. I often have several trains crisscrossing between stations to keep the variety of stations favorable.Islands though can be a pain. Tunnels and bridges are given sparingly, and often at a cost of a new line, or train car which would increase your capacity. I often find it better to have longer cars move people around on an island of just circles, with a short rail with two long cars taking all the squares and triangles to the nearest one on the other shore. Islands with multiple rare symbols are often best split up if you can manage it as well.In short, it's a game that can keep your mind active while you wind down for the evening. The graphics and music are minimal, but entrancing, and the challenges are well chosen. I hope they add more content at some point.I also bought this for my Android for $4.99 I liked it so much so I can play it on the go. Touch controls are a bit touchy, but that's for another review.

												tldr: Wonderful puzzler. Nothing ""Mini"" about the replayability, in case that word has put you off. :)As with so many great puzzlers, this game is simple to play but with a lot of depth. A few tools are given to you at the start of a map (tracks, trains, tunnels), a few more that are offered as choices as time passes. And as time passes, you get more passengers to ferry around, and more stations you need to connect to the network.With your basic building blocks you need to keep passengers moving from station to station. Some of these are unique stations that appear only once on the map, and some are repeated. Handily enough, passengers are happy to go to any one of the stations of the same shape - if only everyone using an city underground was as care-free with their destination!Anyway, the thing I recommend most of all is that you stop reading reviews, go to the publishers' website and try it out online. Then come back here and buy it.At the time of writing this game is in alpha, but it's very polished, and and bugs are fixed very quickly indeed. I _am_ hoping they'll get the audio in before the heat-death of the universe, as the video released showing a sneak peak of that looked good, too!Enjoy!UPDATE: It's been out of Alpha for a long time, and is still a great game (better, even, with a great soundtrack / sfx, and all sort of quality-of-life fixes)!

								This is a great game. The one thing I would change is that each piece transported should pay a fare, then at the end of the week, the player should have the option to use the fare to buy a new line, a new carriage, or build a tunnel/bridge. The way it is now, it is completely random, and nothing is more frustrating than having a beautiful, efficient map, then having a station show up on an island when you don't have a tunnel, then not having a choice to build a new tunnel at the end of the week. Maybe this is the effect that the developers are going for since this is a puzzle game, but it can be pretty annoying.Also, why is Hong Kong so ♥♥♥♥ing hard????			"

								Whether or not you're a strategist or a master micro-manager, or just want to try this game in general, this is a really good game, I've had some fun with this game. Commuter is for people who like a good challenge, and Scenic is just for people who wants to experiment and or just play without worrying about too many passengers on platforms.So far I have been able to give a single train 8 coaches, 9 if you include the loco itself. Each coach and locomotive holds 6 passengers. The stations are commonly Circle, Triangle and Square. The uniques being Gem, Diamond, Plus, Pizza shaped thing, star and a few more.This game is a must for anyone who wants a cheap game that's fun, easy to play and has an easy User Interface.9/10 (the other 1 was deducted due to not many choices of cities, hopefully this will change as they update it.)

								The simplicity of this game reminds me of go. The concepts are simple and easy to grasp but the game quickly becomes increasing difficult, challenging the player to plan ahead or get crushed by the number of people trying to use the station. Just bought it and couldn't put it down for 4 hours. While this is in beta, it is perhaps one of the most complete and fun betas I've playing in a long time, and is really only missing audio (which is coming soon).  Can't say enough about the UI as well. Clean and crisp and easy to navigate. Definitely looks like a london underground system map. At present build (beta 15) this game is an 8/10. Once complete I can't image it being anything less than a 10/10. Buy it! Really inexpensive for the fun. (P.S. to the dev's, this game would be awesome on an Ipad.) "

								Mini metro is a fun casual strategy game about, you guessed it, metro lines. It´s a simple and entertaining game that you can just hop in and out of, but it can also get quite hectic in the endgame. The pricepoint isn´t too high and the levels are varied enough. And the game is in early access, so more is to come, i assume. (Helsinki metro would be awesome :P) If you like casual strategy or subway planning, this is a definite pick.			"

								It is like they read my mind when they wrote this game.  Do you also love trains?  And real-time strategy?  And modern design and feel?  Well, then this may be your perfect game too.  You get to play the chief of your metro system.  Draw the lines where you want and build the perfect system to shuttle passenger shapes hither and yon.  This has been exquisitely executed to resemble a classic urban metro map.  Hours of fun and many pleasurable challenges.			"

												Mini Metro is a revelation; it's been a very long time since I last played a game so original and addictive. Picking up the basics of the game takes moments, but the more you play it, the more you see the inherent depth in the game. The various playable cities at first seem very similar, but after a while you realise that each requires very different strategies. The minimalist art design is excellent. The use of smooth crisp, sharply coloured diagrams really makes you feel like you are creating a tube map. It's amazing how immersive such a graphically simple game can be.I have a few minor gripes; occasionally trains get stuck in the stations for no apparent reason. The random spawning of stations, whilst giving great replayability, can also sometimes make games unplayable. But these are minor issues and I hope they will be fixed soon,The game is a natural fit for tablets and I'll be interested to see a release there, and hoping this will see it get more attention. In my view a real classic.			"

												This puzzle game is surprisingly very soothing.  The music is procedurally generated and is mostly made up of subway beeps and tweeting birds.  When you hit the Game Over screen, the music just fades away as the sound of waves plays over the effect.  Aesthetically, it’s also very soothing, even though Colorblind Mode tends to put the most obnoxious yellow against a white background that makes it barely visible.  Gameplay is very simple and kind of therapeutic.  This is one of the few puzzle games where I didn’t find myself swearing at the game when they would change something up to make it more challenging.I definately recommend this game, especially if you want to play a low-stress time-killer puzzle game.

Early Access Review
								The game took forever to get sound effects (like over a year) but it now has sound effects, which make the game playable. I'd say that the game is now at a level where I can recommend it, if you like this sort of game. I'm still very wary of this developer, and won't be supporting any future early access games they release since they're extremely slow, but this particular game is now at a level where it is playable, so whilst I don't endore the developer, I do think this game is worth it.Its very ""pick up and play"", whilst also being enjoyable for longer periods. Lots of clicking, so if you struggle with carpal tunnel syndrome, this may not be the game for you. It also uses colours for distinguishing gameplay elements, which may be difficult for some colour blind players, but the main colours do seem to have been chosen well; red, blue, green, pink, orange etc, so many colour blind players should still be okay with this game; get someone to check first to see if it is okay for you.I would suggest having some kind of podcast playing so that you can zone out if you're going to play for a couple of hours.*This review was edited after sound effects were added. It used to not recommend the game due to the lack of sound and the length of time that it was taking for an early access game. Whilst I still have major negative feelings towards the developer, this product is at a level where I can give a fair review.			"

												Probably the best casual puzzler I have ever touched.Beautiful in it's gameplay and design. Each level you try to keep your system running in is a work of art in itself.If you have any interest in puzzles, subways / trains, casual gaming, art, or wasting endless hours in bliss, get this now.*** UPDATE ***After playing this for several hours now, I do see that it has some balance and gameplay mechanic issues that hurt it's replayability long term.I feel like this game could have a lot more depth than it does with a few simple changes.Currently the game relys heavily on random scaled spawning to increase difficulty. However because of this, it makes it almost impossible to reach a higher level once you hit the apex on the particular map you are playing.This ensures a short game, but to be honest, hurts the fun a bit as it makes your infrastructure decisions not really matter. The late game is mostly about shuffling around trains and lines to prevent the end temporarily in one particular area. Which then crops up in a different area, etc.I was hoping for deeper gameplay such as having predefined areas of higher population and being able to tweak your lines to have express trains, and multiple trains utilizing a tunnel.The complex railway management just isn't there.But what this game is is a fun, yet casual puzzler, with short rounds that you expect to end after you hit 1,000 people utilizing the same strategy over and over.This is a bit of a disappointment for me but I hold out hope for the developers to keep working on it.I see a LOT of potential here.

Commuter is for people who like a good challenge, and Scenic is just for people who wants to experiment and or just play without worrying about too many passengers on platforms.So far I have been able to give a single train 8 coaches, 9 if you include the loco itself. Each coach and locomotive holds 6 passengers. The stations are commonly Circle, Triangle and Square. The uniques being Gem, Diamond, Plus, Pizza shaped thing, star and a few more.This game is a must for anyone who wants a cheap game that's fun, easy to play and has an easy User Interface.9/10 (the other 1 was deducted due to not many choices of cities, hopefully this will change as they update it.)

								Simple, beautiful, and engrossing. This minimalistic game, although Early Access, is time-warping, mesmerizing and entirely worth it. The lack of sound/soundtrack may well enhance the experience; in Paris you can throw on Chopin's entirely fitting ""Nocturnes"" for some timeless elegance, or Pusha T's ""My Name Is My Name"" for that Black T-shirt Parisian experience. Your call.			"

								This consumed the last two days of my life and that's only the first level. Each game can be quite long but every game is unique and challenging. I hope along the way we get more types of trains and station types but for now, this is the most challenging game that I've played in a long time. I like chess and puzzles and this is golden.			"

								The simplicity of this game reminds me of go. The concepts are simple and easy to grasp but the game quickly becomes increasing difficult, challenging the player to plan ahead or get crushed by the number of people trying to use the station. Just bought it and couldn't put it down for 4 hours. While this is in beta, it is perhaps one of the most complete and fun betas I've playing in a long time, and is really only missing audio (which is coming soon).  Can't say enough about the UI as well. Clean and crisp and easy to navigate. Definitely looks like a london underground system map. At present build (beta 15) this game is an 8/10. Once complete I can't image it being anything less than a 10/10. Buy it! Really inexpensive for the fun. (P.S. to the dev's, this game would be awesome on an Ipad.) "

								Both cohesive and pleasing to the eye, this train game is not just another train game.  While this has been said of almost every train game, Minimetro, offers simple game mechanics with increasing difficulty that provide entertainment and a challenge for anyone.  Micromanage, in realtime, a subway system in one of the world's greatest metropoli. Prevent your stations from overcrowding in an effort to get all of your passengers to their destination.  Offering three gamemodes of varying difficulty, The game can be easily picked up, but will continue to provide a challenge for months to come to even the greatest strategist.   Certainly worth its value this early access game only lacks a soundtrack. Glitchfree and carefree this game excels!			"

								Alright. So this game is straightfowarldy AWESOME.If you expect a hardcore, uber-realistic metro/railway sim - that's not your game, definetly. If you're in for some relaxation... well... maaybe.Generally, what are you going to do while playing this game is trying to fix everything, while it all goes to HELL. Seriously) Mini Metro always starts on a fairly slow pace, but then picks up... And suddenly you're knee deep in ♥♥♥♥♥♥ overcrowded stations, juggling trains from lane to lane and desperatly struggling to save the day, while new stations keep popping at the places you least want them to spawn at. Sounds horrible - but it delivers almost heaven-like feeling of peace and enjoyment. Don't believe me? Try out the free demo on devs' site, it does pretty much develop it.The design is genuine. A masterpiece, a pure delight for eyes. Hope developers would come up with some decent music to match it (some ambient, maybe?), otherwise half the game experience would be ruined ;(  Criteria  Score   Graphics 11/10   Gameplay 10/10   Replayability 8/10   OVERALL 10/10  "

								Mini Metro is a game about management, Simple and intuitive UI/UX keeps you on the edge of your seat, not because of action or thrill; but rather micro-management and the thought of ""How can I make this metro better?” The actual gameplay is satisfying and also link to the UI/UX simplicity. Something about those little rectangles carrying triangles, squares, wedges, etc. is extremely addicting.The added game modes complement the experience my introducing casual modes, different aesthetics and varying maps that subtly change the experience. Highly recommended for those who love a simple puzzle game. Although it would be a shame not to see a mobile port of this game. "

								Mini metro is a wonderful little time waster. if you've got a few minutes to kill and you want something simple to tide you over every now and then you could do far worse. There's something addictive about trying to build the perfect metro that can cope with whatever the game throws at you but you can only do that for so long before one backwater station gets overcrowded to the point of what I assume is acidental death when one of the little shapes falls onto the tracks because the station is packed full of other shapes waiting for their connection. It's simple fun really - there's not much more to it than that. I will say that once you figure out the formula to getting a decent high score the game starts to lose a lot of it's replay value but that said - I still pick it up now and then to kill time before I have to go to work in the morning. as a side note, It's lovely to see colourblind options for this game. along with that the UI is clean and eye pleasing.

												I bought this while in early access as part of the Humble Indie Bundle.I really like some odd games, I think my other reivews note that pretty well. I played a lot of city planners when I was younger, but I always got caught up in how complex they would be (damn you, SimCity 2000!). Mini Metro is a fantastic, stripped-down city planner: all you have to worry about is getting people on to trains, and off of trains. It's incredibly engaging and relaxing, and after the most recent update, includes a great procedural soundtrack from Disaterpeace (Hyper Light Drifter, FEZ) that I wish I could just leave running while I'm working. It's endlessly replayable, and just... so good. Excellent.			"

Just when you thought you had it under control... Another bloody circle station appears...Mini Metro is where you're in charge or a city's transportation. People need to get going. You're the one in charge. You can't screw up. Mini Metro is where things can escalate within a matter of minutes. You'll have about 3 lines connecting to 5 or so stations and then you'll have some strange trickery of loops and squiggles of so-called train lines.There are the ocassional bugs that appear rarely, but notable. When you have a train with more than 8 carriages *i know...*, it can teleport when you've redrawn a line that completely exposes it's temporary line. So basically, when you redraw the track so much so that your train is off the newly drawn track, the train will teleport to the nearest station that the newly drawn line is connected to.Now, of course, this is in Early Access. So, I'm telling you right now, get the game. For $7, it's worth every cent. 10/10, would buy again.			"

An absolute steal for the current price!			"
