												I thought this game would be like some of the old classic hex based strategy games of old.  Like Civil War General 1 and 2 if you remember those from the 90's Sierra days.  I was left pretty disappointed.  I'm a sucker for WW2 games.  The tutorial didn't really explain much of the game.  One of the annoying things of the game is the fog of war.  It exists, but it's not marked.  Most gave used a shadowy area to show you what you can't see.  This game does not.  I think if I was a commander I'd know how far out my units could see.  The interface is a little lackluster.  I wasn't a fan of the sound effects (menu system, game).  3D terrian isn't there.  There should be hills on these maps which should be displayed by elevation (graphically).I could go on, but overally disappointed.  The concept is great, wasn't executed well. "

												I usually like old school turn based strategy games so I tried out this one as well, but some design flaws and balancing issues keep getting on my nerves:-Infantry divisions on the campaign are dirt cheap and there is no people limit of you country so you can basically flood the pacific with your units. Japan as a AI player in the pacific campaign had completely overrun china and south east asia within half a year.-Sea units only very seldom encounter each other and if they do, they hardly damage each other. So in nearly every sea field unescorted enemy troop transports are shipping merrily their cheap units and you only have a chance to sink one if you have a carrier or bomber in that area. So despite I have a gigantic fleet in the Hawai Area the Japanese can constantly land units. Well you don't have to guard your transports either. -By january 43 tech 5 and 4 japanese units popped up, despite he and I had only tech level 1 and they are almost invincible for tech 1 units.So for the pacific campagin you might better play the Hearts of Iron titles which makes a lot of things better.

												Storm over the Pacific is a Fantastic Game for fans of Hex and Counter Tabletop Wargames in the same vein as Rise and Fall of the Third Reich by John Prados. For those of you looking for amazing detailed 3d graphics this may not be the game for you. This is a LONG strategy game. The kind you spend 200-300 hours playing for the long scenarios and maybe 2-3 for the short scenarios. Make sure you find the Manual in the Steam Folder, Play the Tutorial at the bottom of the scenario list. If you don't have these two items which were hard to find this game is nearly impossible to play. However they are easily found if you look and also their is a very good community guide.			"

												esoteric combat metrics will make you lose all your ""strength"" points when attacking troops dismounting from landing craft. Do yourself a favor and stick to Heart of Iron, Squad battles, HPS games, or Matrix Games.			"

												Rare strategy game that allows you to play Japan vs. China pre-WW2 in addition to expected Pacific battles.  You could even play as the ""loose cannon"" country Manchukuo  or other Asian nations as well as Australia.  Make sure to play the tutorial and read the manual -- some controls are not intuitive.

												In game sound effects and menu sounds were just horribly irritating. To actually get into this game you would have to be deaf.			"

												Sadly i must say i dont understand this game at all.Loosing every battle without understanding really why. Cant say that is enjoyable. I have triedto give the game several chanses but sadly no. GFx is ok but the interface feels clumpsy. The sea battles is boring. And the battles on maps you dont really feel that you have controll to manage more than moving. The tutorial could have been alot better.GFx: 6 (gfx looks ok but its hard narrow the maps with all small details)SFx: 7-10 (music is ok and fits the game)Gameplay: 3-10I cant recommend this game.
