												A lovely game that resembles me the ""Long live the Queen"" or the ""Princess Maker 2"".The music is great, it really fits the calm and magical atmosphere of Littlewitch Romanesque.I enjoy the learning system too.Rolling dices has never been so thrilling.I wouldn't mind too much about the R-18 content being removed of this version.To say the truth, I don't think it fits this game in any way. I'm glad this is All-Ages.The graphics are colorful and charming.It's fun too see that you don't just go learning magic without any kind of loreSometimes you even got to see the lessions and explanations about the spells.You have about 3 years in time to turn your two apprendices in full fledged magicians and explore the Dark TowerThe characters don't know much about the tower (main place scenario), so, you have to explore it yourself to uncover it's secrets~This is a game that seems, the more you play, the more fun it gets.I, for sure do recommend this game.

												It’s a cute and charming visual novel with some dice-based gameplay, enjoyable story, great world building, charming art-style and nice characters. You will love it, if you are looking for something calming and slow-paced. Music is repetitive and not remarkable; dices are random and irritate me.You can call this game “little witch training simulator with gameplay”: you are an archmage living together with two students in a tower, each week you decide what your two students will do: study with dices, learn a new magic spell or go for a quest. Sometimes new faces appear and make your tower their home. Every year exams happen and make your life harder. So, it's just a calming slice-of-life experience of a mage and his students living by the countryside.Gameplay: it's your regular visual novel with some dice-based gameplay elements. Visual novel routes are implemented via quests: to see the ending for specific character you must complete all of character’s quests. Every quest has it's own deadline and requirements (often a list of spells which your students must learn), so try to plan ahead while playing or resort to using a guide. Some complex endings require both successful completion and failures for certain quests, and will get specific diplomas for your students. It’s a very long novel/training simulator full of interesting, funny, and scary eventsR-rated content: Along with an All Ages Steam version, I played a standalone 18+ version. Most scenes featuring ""close contacts"" feel totally out of place and unnecessary. It's just like ""Ok, we need to place some porn in this game, - Where? - Right here! - Why? - Because ♥♥♥♥ her, that's why.""Characters: You are not a pedophile. Which is lovely.P.S. For more awesome hidden gems, follow the steam CRIMINALLY Low Sales curator.			"

												rating: loli/10   do get.I've only played an hour as of right now but I have to say, I've already laughed, been emotionally moved and otherwise enjoyed the story. And that's an important note, this is a very story driven game, and it does not fall short at delivering. Another important note is that this is an adult game with the adult content removed. Despite that removal there remains a definite appeal to the lolicon, as there's a panty-shot very early and, I mean really, just look at the angel Sepha.!~  I very much hope that  JAST will see fit to make a patch available to those who wish to reintroduce the explicit content that was removed for distribution via steam ~!I actually bought this in an instant because I'm familiar with the artist's work, knew a bit about this game, didn't know it was available in English and quite foolishly assumed that there would already be the desired patch available as with when I purchased HuniePop (though that's an entirely unrelated game). Needless to say I should have read the description all the way through and now I'm a tiny bit disappointed (in myself mostly).Regarding the actual gameplay, it's quite interesting in how the story is advanced. Rather than dialog trees there's a sort of dice minigame where you get different kinds of ""spirit"" depending on what is rolled, and rolls can be messed with by ""bumping"" the dice as they're rolled, so it's not all chance. The different spirit can be spent to unlock spells, which gives you a scene, the spells can be used when rolling the dice to further modify results as well as being a prerequisite for quests, which also advance the story. there's more to it but that's the general idea.Back to the story, I can't believe how attached I am to these girls already. Aria's straight forward attitude and reckless behavior, Kaya's quiet anxiety and compassion; they both are very quickly established as people with life and personality that makes you want to see them succeed. Their envy of traits they see in the other girl, and their self doubt make them all the more human. The voice acting is good too. I can't help but look forward to getting to know the girls better and guiding them to happiness and success.			"

												You want a visual novel that has a ton of lore? Do you like a visual novel that has gameplay elements? Do you like that gameplay to be technical and complicated, yet managable and still enjoyable? You've found the right one. Take a story that revolves around magical learning and slice-of-life fantasy, then blend it with some time-management and an intriguing dice-rolling mechanic, and you get Littlewitch Romanesque. And is it ever astoundingly good! Nearly every scene between lessons contains lore, and there is enough depth to the worldbuilding within the story to give you a lot for your imagination to explore. The plot, despite being an eroge (with adult scenes removed on Steam), is actually surprisingly not that perverted. If gratuitous sex is a turn-off in other visual novels, you'll be delighted by how focused the plot is on revealing its world and developing its huge amount of characters. Sure, there's some fan-service (as one will always expect due to the genre), but it's almost always either comedic or sentimental, and rarely feels out of place. And don't even get me started on the artwork. HOLY CRAP, is this some absolutely stunning art. You can see the love and detail in every single scene. If you're looking for something story-rich, with fantastic artwork, just the right amount of challenge, and a little less perversion than the status quo, Littlewitch is the VN for you.			"

												I bought two copies of this game-- one on Steam and one from the publisher. I ultimately paid $65 for this game just to justify having a Steam version of Littlewitch Romanesque that was the full version of the game. Do I feel like I overpaid for this game? Not even slightly!Littlewitch Romanesque FEELS like a $65 game, and if you consider that you can have the full game for $40 from the publisher (both a digital copy AND a physical copy in a beautiful box) or the Clean version on Steam for only $25, then you should already know that you are getting a great deal. Seriously, $25 for this game? Clean version or not, that's just a steal! If I wasn't the type of person that hated the very notion of censorship (though I do understand and respect Valve's decision from a legal standpoint), I could have easily bought this version and wondered HOW ON EARTH they didn't realize this game was worth so much more.Alright, alright. Too much praise, not enough Pros/Cons. Here:Pros:-Interesting story-Breathtaking artwork (for both characters AND backgrounds)-Fun, unique, and diverse characters-Great humor throughout the game as well as some surprisingly touching moments-Excellent voice acting-Unusual, yet engaging gameplay elements (though gameplay will also be in the ""Cons"" section)-Managing timed quests proved more difficult than I expected later in the game, adding a layer of (needed) challenge-High Replayability-Ability to skip cutscenes you've already scene (This will be useful on multiple playthroughs. Trust me.)-Physical copy with downloadable version and a few beautifully illustrated cards (""18+"" version only!)-Hundreds of cutscenes (They're great, but also a Con at times)Cons:-Gameplay is rather simple (It's each to cheat the system early on, though it DOES get harder to manage the longer you play)-Some of the ""18+"" scenes are... short. (The first one I encountered didn't last but a few moments, though thankfully that seemed to be an exception and not the norm)-LOTS and LOTS of cutscenes (Sometimes they can get to be too much, especially if you are focused on getting certain quests taken care of)That's all I can really say for right now. Buy Littlewitch Romanesque! Is it worth $25? YES! Is it worth $40 for the ""18+"" version? That up to you, but yes, yes it is (because of Tillet). NOW, is it worth $65 for the full version on Steam? Well, that's a lot harder of a sell for me, but like I said, this does indeed feel like a $65 game, so I have no problem saying it was worth it for me, but I can't speak for everyone, especially since the patched version I'm working with right now doesn't allow for many of the normal Steam features, such as the overlay. Cards still work, though, so that's something.Well, good luck of your decision-- not a decision on ""should I buy"", but a decision of ""which version should I buy"". There should be no question on whether or not to buy this game. It's just a must-own, ESPECIALLY at $25!			"

												Magic is slowly leaving the world, wizards have grown complacent and selfish, and as the young Archmage Domino, you have 3 years to turn the two main heroines, Aria and Kaya, into full-fledged mages within Grimoire Academy. They also happen to be considered Grimoire's worst students, making the 3 years limit a challenge. Domino, however, yearns to explore and push the boundaries of the arcane, and he's eager to train them well.Littlewitch's story takes off well from the beginning thanks to the highly imaginative art put into it. Even the male characters, often neglected in visual novels, are drawn with care and skill, and the same elegant style extends even into the games menus and overlay. Ashito Oyari's style is immediately distinct and enjoyable during all parts of the game, where it fits the nature of the setting so perfectly it makes you wonder whether the art preceded and inspired the entire project.Gameplay is reminiscent of Princess Maker in scope, but it plays much closer to a voiced visual novel with puzzle/stat oriented gameplay attached to give a sense of progress to Domino's goals of teaching and raising the heroines. Between quests and events, there's more than enough to fill several playthroughs in order to see everything within your 3 years in-game time limit. During which, each of the multiple endings are strongly built up, and when they come there's heavy payoff, as you'll want to sit quietly and soak in events unfolding. Thankfully there's a New Game+ mode which retains spells learned during lessons into the next playthrough.This is one of those instances where an ambitious game pays off, where all of the talented components fit together, from the inspired art, sincere story, voicework, and even to the accurate and faithfully nuanced translation JAST has a reputation for, all complimenting each other into an experience above many of its peers in the visual novel space.If you are at all looking for a wonderful story with plenty of magic and imagination, a nostalgic fan of the Princess Maker series, or just in the market for a good VN, I'd highly recommend Littlewitch Romanesque.

IntroGirlish Grimoire Littlewitch Romanesque: Editio Regia is a visual novel with a small interactive gameplay that makes it even more engaging.You play as Domino, a very well known mage that was tasked to study an ancient tower and train two apprentices whom apparently thought to be problem students. Later on.there will be more people who gets involved in your used-to-be quite living in the tower. Most of them are beautiful ladies so it's quite a harem.GameplayAside from it's beautiful comic-style visual novel story telling, LR:ER involves rolling dices that affects the attributes for the apprentices. These attributes are needed to unlock spells, and spells are needed for quests and exams. Some quests also gives you some plus points with the ladies so go show them that magnetic attraction of yours Mr.Wizard..*cough*I'm still hoping for achievements implemented in this game. After all, this visual novel already has gameplay and quests so why not? Even simple VNs in steam has achievements, it would be fun to have it for LR:ER.Final words....This is the first Littlewitch game that  I've played. It was just sheer curiosity that I picked up a title that is aimed for males and I wasn't disappointed.Primarily because there's always an event brewing and more characters being introduced. I'm still getting a hang on the dice rolling, I'm not lucky or skilled to turn the tables but I'm trying...to woo the ladies ^_~ *wink*The artwork and music is beautiful, and I dig the lighthearted atmosphere and funny scenes. One of my gripes with the game is it's small resolution. You get an option to turn it into fullscreen but for people who are anal with graphic bluriness you might not like it. I cannot recommend this game to folks who are triggered  to fan service and gets offended to seeing an art of a skimpy translucent clothing of an angel character or pantsu from your apprentice or another lady. But to folks who can bypass that, then I really recommend this gem. I hope more Littlewitch games will come to steam!			"

												Alright... I was waiting quite a while before writing review for this one. It will be rather short, as I'm honestly still disturbed by this game. I like to play full version of games, instead of censored ones, so whenever there is visual novel with cut-out 18+ content, I try to restore it. Usually it's a good decision. It certainly wasn't in this case, although I wonder if ""censored"" version is really that much different in terms on panty-shots, innuendos, the way characters speak to you and treat you. If not, it's not really helping this game. ""Littlewith Romanesque"" manages to make sex scenes with older looking characters awkward and almost uncomfortable. And there are plenty ""not-old-looking"" characters too, like cat lady, your two young students or angel. I could go with ""just an art style"", if there weren't any normal looking women AND if the young-looking characters wouldn't act in a childish manner. They do. Add to that, that it's get pretty clear, at some point, that you will end up with one (or maybe even two) of yours students in sexual situation and it gets even more gross, since I had really hard time perceiving them as anything more than children and I wanted to see their bond with main character as father-daughters and not something so disturbing. I think pretty much every female character presented in the game, wants to sleep with protagonist at some point, which is ridiculous on its own. So that was part about disturbing stuff. How is actual gameplay and is it worth your time? I'll be honest with you - as someone who loves titles like ""Long Live The Queen"", I was very interested in concept of ""raising"" witches, teaching them skills and spells, observing how this  affect the plot and so on. And it's fun. For like 5 hours max. After that you have enough of rolling the dices and teaching them new abilities, especially after you discover, that almost every set of quests, ultimately leads to, wait for it, sex scene! Seriously, at some point it become quite obvious, that raising students isn't my main goal in this game. Disappointing and disturbing.			"

												Ah Littlewitch Romanesque where do I begin, Hmm...This VN has a litte bit of everything in it. It deals with the era at the end of magic, while you (A teacher of Magic) and one of the very few left trying to pass on magic knoweldge to two young girls. These girls who were not up to academy standards and are believed to be somewhat incabable of learning. Although being considered as archemage in this story 'Domino' you soon relise that you could learn a thing or two while trying to teach your two ahm minions magic. Your job is to make these two girls fully fledged mages in three years. It starts by taking these girls out of the academy, and into the unknown world.The Pros:- Great Writing- Great Characterisation- Minigames- Long Gameplay- Fantasic  Art - Lot's of choices- Amazing Sountrack- Old school Magic in a VNThe Cons- If VN's with strategy arn't your thing- Loli humor if it isn't your thingOther than that it's a great game "

												This is an extremely addictive raising sim/visual novel.  Be warned that by purchasing this on Steam you will not be getting the adult content that is present in this game.  You will want to buy this game from jastusa (be sure to switch to the 18+ version of the site) if you want to see that content.The actual game consists of 150+ weeks (turns) where you may attempt a lesson (which is where the actual dice-rolling gameplay occurs), learn a spell, or go on a quest.  Each week also includes a story scene at the beginning and end of the week.  Each learned spell and quest completed also yields a story scene, so if you do either of those things (and you usually will), you will have 3 story sequences in a week.  Going through these turns and trying to learn spells needed for quests is quite addictive, and even though this game could be considered a visual novel, I sometimes wanted to just skip all the story sections to get back to my objectives.  That, for me was the most frustrating aspect of this game; it sometimes feels like it takes forever to accomplish something because of all the exposition I had to get through in order to do so!  It seems like this may have been even more the case in the adult version where even more scenes can come up.What mainly sold me on this game is the art and gameplay.  The art is fantastic and maintains excellent quality the whole way through.  Even the ordinary character portraits never get old and everything, including backgrounds was done with utmost care.  The music is also nice and the ending theme especially is excellent.  It is impossible to do everything in this game in a single playthrough.  It took me a little over 10 hours to get through my first playthrough, and on subsequent playthroughs, you can use previously learned spells during the dice rolling lessons, which really increases your potential to learn magic.  Because many scenes will have already been read, and can be skipped, new playthroughs have a really good pace and it's fun to try to do events (quests and spells) you chose not to focus on originally.  Overall this game is very addictive and excellent value.One thing to note is that even though explicit content was removed for this version of the game, there are still panty shots and other segments that sexualize the students, who look and act like early junior high students.  If you are uncomfortable with that, be aware before you buy.			"

Product received for free
												Full disclosure: I received my copy of Romanesque in a promotional giveaway when it came out.Romanesque is a very fun casual raising-sim. It can require some level of strategy if you want to get all of the endings or unlock all of Kaya/Arya's spells in a single run, but nothing too excessive. It is highly suitable for casual play.The art and sound are both very good and pleasant to look at. The dice game which Romanesque is centered around does get a bit repetitive at times, but it's not too bad. There are also a couple hundred different 5-minute scenes that show up between the game, when spells are learned and so on, so the game rarely gets boring.The restoration patch is pretty recommended, as cutting out some of the original content does leave a bit of an awkward hole in the flow of the game.

												Description and screenshots don't give a full impression of the game- it's a 'lolicon' dating simulator with lots of panty shots, sexual scenes and stuff that scirts on the borderline of being classified as 'nudity' by technicality alone.The 'all-ages version' censorship patch is incorrectly named, this is very much not suitable for under 18s. The 'censorship' literally just whites out the screen during sex scenes, making them dialogue only. (With full voiceacting!) And it does nothing to remove gigantic cameltoe scenes or bare chests on these seemingly-underage characters.I have nothing against people who enjoy that sort of game, but I'm asexual and this was a horrible surprise! Don't waste your money if you're expecting something like Recettear instead of Huniepop.			"

												I enjoyed playing this game for relaxing after stress filled games. The dialogue is pretty good and the characters are really alive interesting and unique. The dice rolling is challenging enough later to make you start having choices on the quests. It's really interesting to see what crazy setup to do with the dice rolling. It's not really left up to chance since it's really a mini game meant to be using as little as much influence but enough to perform big combos. My love for the wonderful short stories these characters have really makes me happy I bought this. If you want a game with flavor but casual give this one a whirl.			"

Just give it some time. Although I was annoyed at first trying to focus on spells and dices to advance plot. I was failing magic lessons but I got used to this fantasy life cut into weekly pieces. It is chaotic game because of numerous characters. You know though in general during a game month no real changes are made but new people are introduced all time. We dont have any impact on story except doing quest in Dark Tower. You will uncover small things about game universe with students Arya and Kaya and you will witness some cheerful flirts as Archmage Domino. Usually though scenes are short and thats a bit of unfortunate to get over with. Also kinda silly thing that only one of the two students can learn one spell at a time - that means the other sits and do then nothing.Thats it. No hard emotional breakdowns. No crazyness. Nothing outstanding really nor negative. Just slowly but nicely made bounds between characters with incredibly well done voice acting - oldschool. If you want to read something lightly adventured and fun. Meanwhile keeping your head occupied with resource management then this game is for you. Ah forgot to mention game can be easly patched to full content if you are concerned about it.			"

												I was really enjoying this game, really good interface for a visual novel with some extra gameplay and lots to do. Then, well... then the angel character arrived. Guess what, she looks like a ten-year-old and has practically nothing covering her bits. I'm down with angels being nude or genderless or ageless, etc,, I mean they're celestial beings, what do they care. But this was very obviously a huge log being thrown into the pedo fire. She calls you master and you can see every inch of her body, it's disturbing. Basically, an otherwise good game is once again ruined by trying to normalize the sexualization of prepubescent bodies. Before this I was pretty happy with how comfortable and practical the womens' clothing was, but then one of the underage girls you're teaching gets a fully drawn panty shot, so... can't believe I spent this much money to be proven that little girls aren't safe from casual objectification. Not to mention all the comments talking about wanting it to have more sexual content... just gross. Can't we have sexual visual novels (which I also like) be sepperated from ones starring children? I really wanted to like this, it seemed like it was going to be really cute and interesting, and the art is great, But yeah, thinking about people fapping to this angel makes me want to puke.			"

												I was very disappointed in this game, as it is far more like reading a book with a dice based minigame instead of like playing a game. It has no branching paths, no real actual choices, and it is all based on the luck of the rng dice gods whether you will get the spirits you need for progression.  It honestly feels more like a novel then anything else, but if it was a Virtual novel i would definitely feel cheated without some form of choice or branching chapters as well. Very much different then expected, i expected more game and less reading, so be warned!			"

												Tons of lore, side stories and spells. Girlish Grimoire Littlewitch Romanesque is a game about making two lolis masters of magical arts within 3 years. While you won't have much freedom turning them to the kind of mage you desire, the character interactions will make up for it, big time.			"
