												I FIXED IT!To everyone that keeps saying that Uplay crashes and that you can't play this is what you need to do:1) Uninstall the game and Uplay (AKA Ubisoft Launcher)2) Install Uplay from Ubisoft's site.3) Login with your account (on Uplay) and make sure you're online.3.1) There is an option to activate game, choose it.3.2) Copy the game's activation code to it (the one Steam provides you)3.3) It will ask you if you want to activate From Dust to that account, choose yes.4) In Uplay, choose ""Go Offline"", and that's it (but don't close Uplay).6) Install the game on Steam and playNote: In Uplay's settings I recommend that you choose ""Always start Offline"" and disable any synchronization to Uplay (specially the save files), because it is absolute garbage, you should also disable overlay.For those wondering, the problem is the interaction between Steam and Uplay, and the fix is launching (and installing) Uplay by itself instead of letting Steam do it.The game itself is a lot of fun, it sucks that Ubisoft had to ruin it, I would recommend the game, but not the company.

												Don't get this game, not because it's bad, but simply because it uses Uplay.I pre-ordered from dust when it came out and loved it, sadly I lost my old email and I've been unable to login to Uplay. I contacted Ubisoft and pretty much got a big middle finger in response; they refused to help me, even when I offered paypal transaction details. When I said the legality of their pracices relating to CD keys is questionable within the EU, they stopped responding and two weeks later, they sent an email saying that the support ticket had been closed.I've tried their support another three times but they've offered me no help.Find some other way of playing this game if you must, it's pretty fun; but don't buy it from Ubisoft.

												TL;DR, I highly, highly recommend playing this game, but I do not recommend buying it. This is one of the coolest concepts I have ever seen destroyed by an unusable DRM scheme.From Dust is a work of art. Watching the form of the earth change and mould as the player manipulates it brings back memories of Black and White, but with a sense of visual awe that comes from being a much more recent game. It is something that I feel any gamer owes it to themselves to experience at least once. Sadly, I can't recommend buying the game, as I have an ethical objection to UPlay. The alternative, a Chrome app that is free in the Chrome Store, is okay, but ultimately Ubisoft's disingenuity has ruined, or at least limited access to, what I consider to be an actual art piece.Fun fact: Ubisoft actually patched the game to remove UPlay. I had been hoping that would happen and bought it shortly after. Only a few months later, I had been happily enjoying my new game when I launched one day to find UPlay had been patched back in.Ubisoft, I know you're not listening, but stop punishing your customers for buying your products. You did the right thing once before and removed the DRM from this game. Now that the DRM is back on, I would not be surprised to find the number of seeders for this game on torrent sites has spiked. No one wants a content management system inside another content management system, especially if they only have one or two games in the ""nested"" one.			"

												From Dust was a very fun puzzle sandbox game, until UPlay got involved. It didnt need it back when it got released, but now you cant play it unless you log in with a Ubisoft account. Now dont get me wrong. While I dont mind too much about logining in and saving the info so I dont have to do it over and over, the fact that the game didnt have this at launch(or a couple years after) is what drives me away. The fact that they felt it was neccesary to include this ""Feature"" that late in the game just shows me what kind of paranoid, crazy, and untrusting company Ubisoft is becoming.			"

												This game is beautiful, the physics are the best I've ever seen and the environments are pretty, but that only gets it so far, the AI is stupid, and the men seem to be incapable of moving out of the way of water and lava coming right for them, and are confused my tiny differences in height, where I have to dump earth all over just to convince them to climb it, the game doesn't let you build a village where there is 'too much water', which is fine until you find yourself not being able to find where the water is in this tiny area, because you're not allowed to have a single drop in the place you want a village. Getting to the next level seemed more frustrating and tiresome than fun. I pre-ordered this on Steam and was really looking forward to it, but was ultimately disappointed.			"

												From Dust is a creative and interesting god-game/strategy game. It's sort of an update on Populous. Way better looking than Populous, though.I enjoyed playing From Dust through about half of the game's missions. Figuring out how to manipulate the environment to advance your tribe through a series of goals is fun and challenging. But after about 5 levels, the game's challenge became less about figuring out a strategy, and more about executing it with the awkward controller scheme. After about 8-10 levels, it just became too awkward to play. The strategy elements of the game outgrew their clumsy control scheme.I might recommend this, though, if it's on deep sale. It's pretty to look at, and I had a good couple of hours of fun before deciding the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. ...That damned level with the burning trees. Gah.			"

""From dust we came and fought the natural forces""An amazing little godmode game, where you can handle the elements earth, water and lava. I think it's too small, only 15 levels, more like an advertising game. But the concept is quite good and challenging. On the one hand you have to protect your people from deadly floods, on the other hand their villages get burned down by fire caused by the lava. Sometimes you have to fight all the elements together at once. Then you should have the right strategy to survive...			"

												The Steam version of From Dust runs just fine without Uplay. If that's the only thing preventing you from buying it, then don't let it keep you from experiencing what is a very unique and enjoyable strategy game.It will only take you 5 minutes, at most, to create a firewall rule so that From Dust will run just like any other non-Uplay Steam game. You don't need a Ubisoft account either, and you can play in offline mode.After downloading From Dust, but before starting it for the first time, install Ubisoft Game Launcher from the From Dust\Support\Ubisoft directory. Then use Windows Firewall to block the Ubisoft launcher from using the internet, which will prevent it from updating to Uplay when you start the game.That's all you need to do. If you aren't familiar with how to use Windows Firewall, there is a short guide that will show you how to create a rule for From Dust right here:

												From Dust is a fun physics game that won't keep you coming back again and again to play it, but luckily the technology itself has aged well. What other game has free-flowing water, sand, and lava that can all be mixed together to create rock, land, volcanoes, mountains, earthquakes, and tsunamis? If you are hoping that the very end of the game unlocks a no-strings-attached sandbox mode, however, you may be slightly disappointed. The sandbox mode that you get at the end is another level where you get to use all the abilities you gain across the rest of the game to beat the level. After you beat it, you return to the main menu. From there you can choose to play it again, but it doesn't feel at all like a truly free sandbox mode. If you can get past that, then I would recommend this game simply so you can playing with water, sand, and lava.			"

												I don't play a lot of ""God games"" but for me From Dust was fresh and different. Tasked with guiding a primitive tribe on a quest for answers about their past you are given control of the environment, picking up dirt, water, and lava, to clear paths or build them, while fighting off nature itself.Visually From Dust is appealing with beautiful tropical islands to arid deserts and lava crusted mountains. The way your powers mold the environment also looks very good. The campaign is just about the right length with a lot of extra content in challenges or open worlds if you're craving more in the end.For the most part everything works as expected. Occasionally you will drown or burn some of your people but almost always it's because of your own mistake. That being said, occasionally the AI has some pathing issues that lead them into unnecessary danger and get them killed. More common though is having trouble telling where the AI will allow you to go, mostly involving how steep a slope they will walk up. This can cause problems when you think you have a clear path but the AI refuses to move and reverts to complaining about how much they are now on fire. It was never bad enough for me to make me stop playing though.From Dust is a nice change of scenery and play style that is definitely worth your time.			"

												From Dust has been repeatedly misidentified as a ""God"" game, which it is not. It is more accurately described as a terraforming puzzle game, and a very good one at that, managing the ideal puzzle game balance of simple, intuitive mechanics that are extended across a substantial breadth and depth of scenarios. It's one crippling drawback is the horrid, controller-developed control scheme, although this is manageable and somewhat forgivable.			"

												First of all this game will require Uplay to play and you will have to lock your serial to that one account so don't forget the information. While annoying, this is doable and not the only game like it. Wish I had read more of the steam reviews before buying. I would not recommend this game and if you already bought it, my sympathies, but it is not the next Black and White. Buy at own risk, I cannot stress this enough.Controls and Mechanics: Saw a lot of complaints about this. Some buttons are counter intuitive or not 'the norm' but you can grow accustomed to them fairly quickly there's only two really weird ones. UI is spare so you aren't overwhelmed with options. Movement of the cursor corresponds with the movement of your avatar and 90% of the time this is fine and you get used to it fast. The other 10% of the time it will go too far too fast or something at just the wrong time and Bad Things will happen because of it (this has caused me to restart at least one map). Similarly 1-2-3-4 isn't hard to remember, but when the powers attributed to them shift around you have to constantly check the menu to make sure you're using the right power.The AI of the people is actually fairly decent - when it works. When it doesn't you get dozens of annoying little voices screaming at you from the top of a hastily erected pillar as rivers of lava flow around them, voices which you cannot stop until either that lava does, or one of your powers comes up, etc. Furthermore idiotic people have cost me wins before, causing me to have to restart some maps several times or making simple tasks very hard. Camera: Similar to dungeon crawlers, up above and slightly behind the avatar with the option to zoom in a little or to zoom in completely (and not be able to do anything) on just one of your humans. Like the controls 90% of the time this is fine, but when it goes wrong it can be very frustrating giving the fast liquids you are working with.Now to the reason I am writing this review: some spoilers ahead (I try not to name names). Surprisingly interesting premise and I genuinely wanted to see my people through and to find out more about what had happened before me. The cut scene between maps gets annoying overtime since its pretty long and just the same footage over and over again but that's not game breaking. What is game breaking is the end. The last level. First of all the game froze just as I was about to complete it so I had to go back and do it all over again (first time this had happened). I hesitate to detail what exactly happens but suffice to say that I was extraordinarily displeased, felt that absolutely NONE of the plot points were tied up (they didn't even try to softball something in or if they did it was too subtle for my shock and disappointment to see it), we weren't given any revelations or massive info dumps, its one giant screw you to the idiot stupid enough to waste their time on this game. Before the end I was willing to give this game a pass and say there were some levels worth redoing, some content worth getting every little bit from, but afterwards I uninstalled the game without second thoughts.

												An extremely gorgeous and breathtaking experience, enjoyable with few weak points throughout the game. If you loved Cryo Interactive's games in the 90s, such as Lost Eden, then you'll also love From Dust.The atmosphere of this game is pretty unique. The puzzles have a gradual learning curve, the challenges are pretty cool. Sometimes things can be a bit annoying to control. Speaking of which: play this with a 360 pad, not the keyboard & mice. It's so much better.Overall I'd recommend it almost on the atmosphere alone, which I'm a big fan of.			"

												Once you get past Uplay, and I did swear at the screen many times during this process, this is a good game.I wouldn't call it a 'God' game. There's no morality choices, no true growth of a civilization, and you’re the only ‘god’ around. It’s you against nature, in a series of puzzles to test your growing powers. It doesn’t take long to make your way through the puzzles, and while there’s a sandbox mode in there as well. It didn’t really hold my attention. Expect 5- 10hrs Gameplay, depending on how fast you like puzzles.All considered, it's physics engine is beautiful, the gameplay is simple but fulfilling, and if you get angry you can wall up your little guys and let them slowly drown beneath the growing tide.Once again, Ubisoft is a pain, Uplay is stupid. But if that’s the biggest downside; it must be a decent game. "

 It's a pretty nice game, buy it but if it does not work, better pirate it. As MANY of the reviewers said, it's a nice game full of breath-taking art, incredible music and deep atmosphere but try to crack it, because of the Uplay and Steam issue. Even tho, I do not had any problems playing it and the 5€ paying was totally worth it since it was on the sale.Now to the game:You play god. Controll earth, water, lava and plants. Build your own cities and create your own story of you followers.If you like games like SimCity but you are more interested in strategy, this game is a must-have for you. Set your cities, plan them to be safe, form rivers around them to let your citizens not be eaten by lava. Follow the individuals to get ancient signs and bring themm safe home.All in all. Buy the game if you like it, download the game by warez if it doesn't work. This is not a game, this is a masterpiece.			"

												I'm surprised many people down-vote this great piece only because of uplay. Uplay is a bit tiring, but the review should solely be done of the title not the other third-party system. It has a very unique atmosphere of environment.Players have to lead the small groups of tribes and achieve given goals.The obstacles are environmental hazards mostly. The physics system is beyond words. It creates a beautiful scenary while you have a power to reform terrainand also feels very responsible for such little lives of tribes. It is a genesis simulator. It gets challenging in the later phase.			"

You can get the game easily working within 5 minutes, you just have to uninstall the uPlay that comes with the game, and instead use the one from the official website. Beyond uPlay this game is fantastic. With the completely terraformable worlds and amazing powers and gameplay its a definite buy in my opinion. I personally like the water physics most. Its just very intricate and well scripted, even on a large scale when the lakes and tsunamis are involved. And who can resist taking a large glob of lava and setting your village on fire?			"

												The actual game play is minorly interesting. Can be very pretty. However I'm glad the game only cost me $6 ... the UPlay Situation is obnoxious to say the least and even when I've closed the game out UPlay keeps the process running such that it looks like I logged 13 hours playing it ... which I certainly didn't.

												From Dust gives you a place you can design on your own. Throuugh the story you will unlock more powers and so you can shape the land stronger. The Story is perfectly told and hides many secrets you will uncover. A negative point is the lack of a Sandbox mode. You are in a quarter and you can only form the land in that quarter. In conclusion this game is worth buying though you shouldn't expect much from it.			"

												An amazing adventure, magical humble little game that puts you into role of a god that guides mysterious tribe on journey to discovery through the power of terraforming. Every mission is essantially a puzzle to solve and with increasing difficulty it results into about 10 hours of top notch entertainment. Some people throwing temper tantrums because of the uplay, I had no problems with it at all (I never had uplay crashing or anything those guys are ""experiencing""). The important thing is that a review that only lists problems with uplay is not a review of this game at all. The game is an overlooked gem, it has amazing aesthetics and so much charm most of the other titles would be envious. It's not a groundbreaking title, as this was done before, but it's done really well.Two reasonable criticisms - mouse controls are not that good, and while your villagers aren't exactly lemmings, they can be pretty dumb. Neither of those are serious issues and will only take a few moments to get used to it.			"

												From Dust is a brilliantly done, wholly unique... gosh what to even call it? RTS? Eh, I dunno about that. Simulator? Kinda?  You get to play as a god that shifts the terrain of a planet in order to benefit your people. That's what you do; I don't know what to call that kind of game, but I guess that's my bad.  Anyway, it's not only a gorgeous game but it's so well crafted in mechanics, character, and just overall design that I cannot recommend it enough. It's a game that challenges you, but does so in what seems like a nonthreatening way so your motivation as a player feels very organic and unforced. The soundtrack is jawdropping, and helps to draw you into the world like nothing else. In short, for those who want an immersive, unique take on the sim/RTS franchise, pick up From Dust. You will not be disappointed.			"

												The Uplay issue has long since been fixed! The game is perfectly playable from Steam.Now I got this game to fill the void left behind Black and White. There just hasn't been a god game to equal it despite it's flaws. This could have been a worthy successor, though it may be a little too eccentric for some players.I like the tribal setting, its not something we get to see very often in games and it gives this game its unique sense of identity. It starts to lose its edge however as most of the game is manipulating the enviroment in very puzzle like ways, to get your little tribe from point A to point B. There's really not that much more than can be said. It's seems addicting, but it's no Black and White. Unfortantly it got tedious fast. I just can't in good concience recommend it.			"

												While this is a recommendation in favor of From Dust, it comes with a lot of qualifiers. This is not a game that is worth full price. Yes, the graphics and production value are above average. And yes, this is a well designed God Game. And yes, because of the dynamic way in which the world behaves in reaction to your choices can drastically change the playthrough of any particular level. And ultimately yes, the levels (what few there are) are well designed.But that brings me to my first complaint: There are only 12 levels (not counting the finale which doesn't really count since you can easily win simply by not using anything but the Breath of Earth.) For a full priced game, this is scaled more as a tech demo and paying full price is outrageous. (And I mean that to be a bit dramatic, because Fromt Dust is offensively short.)It took me roughly 6 hours to beat the game (And I had to play at least three maps over.)Which leads me to my next complaint:  There are no saves. If you fail, you have to start over from the beginning of the level. That's not horrible, but it is made painful by the unskippable cutscenes and monologues at the beginning of each level. If you're not beating the level in the first or second try, the tedium of unskippable cutscenes is likely to drive you slightly mad. The cutscenes are ""cute"" the first time through, but after that they start to grate on your nerves. Your followers don't speak English. Everything is subtitled. While this seems like a novel idea at the beginning, people speaking gibberish at you on the start of each level (coupled with the fact that you cannot bypass it) quickly becomes annoying. This annoyance is mercifully mitigated by the short ""single player campaign."" (Of questionable value, since it also means there isn't much meat on the bones of this game.)My third complaint is that it requires Uplay, Ubisoft's DRM. Ubisoft's DRM is draconian. There are multiple features in many games that simply do not work if you do not have an active internet connection (as opposed to Steam, where that connection is only required on first activation.) Additionally, Uplay fails to install correctly when installed through Steam and you have to jury rig it to work (I put a guide together under From Dust for anyone who buys this and runs in to the installation problem and goes looking for the solution.) While Ubisoft has removed some of the other unpalatable elements of Uplay DRM, it still remains the poster child for ""what not to do"" among game producers.However, if you catch this on a sale ($5-10 tops) and you can tolerate dealing with Uplay, you will find yourself faced with a few (very few) enjoyable hours with Fromt Dust.The gameplay that derives from wielding god powers (water, warth, fire and life-- no air here) is enjoyable. The sense of urgency that derives from the interaction between floods and earth washing away, or between a lava flow steadily working its way into your followers-- these interactions are compelling and interesting.Unlike Molyneux's ""God Game Remake in Godus"" there is no farmville experience here. You really are left solely with Godly concerns. How do you unlock your next power?, how do you expand your followers across the world in the face of looming environmental disaster?, how do you help them escape the world before the tenuous balance you've maintained comes crashing down around you and your followers?The story is nothing special. It starts as a question, and it ends as a question.The graphics are pretty spectacular (for what it is). There's not a ton of individualized follower behavior (You typically zoom all the way out and do your best to stay on top of the floods, or the tsunamis, or the volcanos  that are poised to end your followers.) But the environmental effects are pretty interesting. Water that is volumetric and looks like water. It has waves, it feeds plant life, it cools lava. Lava that is equally volumetric, and which cools when it thins, leaving behind a layered rock strata on which the next wave of lava will rise over it. Each river, be it water or lava, is unique and behaves according to physics which seem realistic (so long as you don't analyze them too heavily.)The game performs well (one crash of the game, one crash of Uplay before I applied the installation fix I mentioned earlier). The audio is well designed, if a bit shallow and repetative. The digeridoo sounds are thematic and interesting (but if you don't like them, they become fairly constant in late game and that is likely to get on your nerves.)All in all, despite its many flaws, I would give From Dust a positive rating-- at a much lower price point.If you happen to see this on sale and feel like a few hours with a novel take on the God game genre, then give this a try. (But don't get it except on sale, because there just isn't much under the hood to justify the cash expenditure.)			"

												-Choppy graphics as its old and had poor support from the start. Use a controller. -limit your expectations, that way you won't be disappointed. Buy for $5 or less.-Only good for mindless building/destroying on the last level. The last level is a sandbox level.-Put 1,000hrs+ in this on another platform as it was something simple I could mess with while watching the stock market. It didn't help me make money.Had arid vegetation appear in sandbox level from a glitch. Carefully cultured the arid vegetation, its glitch seed was a small area spawned forth from a dead tribesman. I did this untill it encompassed all viable landscape. This required burning away the traditional tropical vegetation so the arid could grow, this took some time as arid vegetation growth rates are slow.Arid vegetation does not burn when in contact with lava or fire. Lost arid vegetation to accidental tsunami. Losing it was devastating.8/10			"

												This game honestly has to go down as one of my top 10 games. People that are looking for a Black and White clone this isn't it. Its a sandbox physics game and I found it highly addictive. The water physics are amazing and I have never seen a game with water this advanced. Basically each level is a puzzle (think Lemmings if you will) where you have to get your tribes people to the exit by claiming all the different sites around the map. Once this is done the exit will open and you can lead them to it. Obviously its not that easy as tsunamis, fires and even erupting volcanoes try to stop your progress. You can manipulate the water, lava, sand etc to help you along the way as well as being able to restart the map if you feel you f'd up because you wanted to see what happened if you diverted that river into that volcano..Sad for the people that had issues in the past with the DRM/Uplay stuff but it looks like Steam has changed that now and for me I was able to open the game right from Steam without any issue.For the hours of fun and cheap price of £7 I would have to give this 9/10			"

												This is a beautiful sandbox game in that it is literally like playing in the sand. I bought it on sale, and for whatever it cost me (maybe $10) it is one of by happiest gaming hours/$ spent. I got about 10 hours out of it at this point and am very satisfied.Visuals:Totally great. Sure, they could be better, but I loved getting down to the tribe's viewpoint and watching the tidal waves come, or the water rise. So neet.Challenge:Not too hard, but kept me on my toes even on low difficulty on the later levels. YMMV.Replay:The game is really attractive, and the challenges of each level ensured that I played each level through at least twice. However, beyond this once-or-twice level replay I did not feel the urge to replay. Partilly this is because on many levels while there are multiple ways to get through the challenges, but usually there is a clear optimal one. I know I'll pick it up in a few months and enjoy it again, once I have forgotten some of the tricks though. Imagination inspiring:Just amazing. If you ever played in the sandbox as a kid, or built sand castles on the beach, check this out. Some of the less obvious strategies can be fun to at least try!Uplay/copy protect:Whatever system other people have their legitimate complaints about... it didn't effect me. Maybe there was an overhaul of the system? It did not affect me in the slightest, so I consider this issue resolved. Note, I played on steam/pc.			"

												If you can get this without Ubisoft getting their incompetent EA-wannabe claws into it, do so. It's a really good game that has sadly had its reputation marred by Ubi's typical bumbling. Do bear in mind however, this is really more of a puzzle and skill game than the god game it looks like. If you're after a resource management style sim game you'll have to look elsewhere.From Dust plays like a very stylized physics puzzle game and is tremendously nice to look at, to boot. Admittedly I mostly grabbed the game because it was Eric Chahi's return to gaming, and I was interested in what he had to offer. The man certainly hasn't lost his touch - while I feel the game's concept certainly could have been taken further, it does what it sets out to do pretty well.			"

												Controlling the power of good and evil.....no, wait....this is not Black & White. From Dust is not about training a creature and fighting other gods. It combines some elements of Populous and B&W but it is very unique in it's own way.The game is set in an extreme version of planet earth. Being a god, you must protect your tribe against the powers of nature by manipulating the world with sand, water and lava. Help your people to survive and expand. Besides the campaign, you can play several time-based challenges.Eric Chahi and his team created an intense god simulation game with a marvelous physics engine, a great contribution to a genre, which is unfortunately very rare and inconspicuous.

												Don't let the beautiful pictures on the Steam shop page blind you; this is -in 9 of 10 cases- not what you'll actually see while playing the game. I'm not saying that the graphics of From Dust were ugly, they are not. But you watch the world from high in the air, and the tiny people of this world are just that: tiny, tiny people. But that's not the problem of the game. I admit, I was hoping for a modern version of ""Populous"". A proper God-simulation. But your powers as a God in this game are highly limited. Everything in this game is highly limited. Your tiny people have to discover or populate around certain obelisks before you can work wonders. Those ""wonders"" allow you to manipulate the world to a degree. I'd say 80% of the play time, you pick up sand and drop it somewhere else. This way you create land for your tiny people, or you dig ravines for controlling the flow of waters. It's actually quite fun for a while, but pretty soon it gets old. You are doing pretty much the same all the time. From Dust clearly is not the new Populous. The old hit from 1989 beats From Dust in the categories fun, length and complexity. The world of From Dust provides only roughly one dozen maps, and those are not really huge. Between the maps you watch the same boring sequences again and again, you do the same things again and again, move tons of sand from A to B so that after some settling you can get your tiny people to make it to the exit of the world. Maybe that's why we only got a dozen or so maps (of which the first few are pretty much meant as tutorial maps...), because the developers realized that the game concept is simply not complex and entertaining enough to motivate for more than 10 or so hours. French games are often pearls of innovation and creativity, but this one sadly, is not.			"

												This is a definite DO NOT BUY.In order to play this game you have to install UPLAY and play it through that. The game DOES NOT WORK AT ALL through steam.So basically if you want to play this you have to buy it. Then go to uplay and download their software. Install it. Then you have to hope that the CD key is valid and your account doesn't get banned because of their poor DRM.Not worth it.			"

												BUYER BEWARE!!!First of all, steam YET AGAIN fails to warn customers that you MUST make a Uplay account and log in online to play.Secondly, For many people including myself the Uplay launcher crashes instantly. Making it impossible to play the damn game to begin with.0/10 for Ubisoft the epic fail of a company. I personally hope they go bust and the founders commit suicide.			"

												I luckily didn't have any problems with Uplay while I played this game, but it was mediocre even still. There's a really cool idea at the core of the game and it's ruined by terrible AI and imprecise controls. If it's on sale and you're ok with a casual game with no worthwhile story and little replay value, then go for it. Otherwise, just watch some gameplay and move on after you've seen the mechanics.

****DO NOT BUY THIS GAME****1. Comes with mandatory Ubisoft Uplay which will cripple your machine due to DRM.2. Have to register with Uplay.3. Once registered to Uplay your cd key will never work again.4. Crashes and freezes ALL the time I tried on 4 different computers! Couldn't even finish the tutorial!5. After the last crash doesn't even show the main menu anymore, absolutely unplayable.Do NOT buy this, you will only support sneaky DRM third party crapware by doing so.

There are 12 levels and one more that is you create your own land. You may clock in 7 hours on your fist playthough. Plus lots of possible replay value.

												This is a pretty decent and fun god game where you get to help a tribe of people regain their lost knowledge and grow as a civilization but due to the constant crashes and glitches I have trouble recommending it. You take on the form of a deity known as the breath and have been bestowed the power to absorb and spit out the various elements of the land water and earth. Using this you can form land bridges or small lakes to help your tribe survive; it is a lot of fun.This game is a good game but the port has something to be desired. I managed to play it through to completion a few years ago but even then it crashed repeatedly and now it is almost unplayable. If you can put up with the technical problems or are lucky and don’t have any then this is a real gem and worth playing but if not then I wouldn’t recommend it.Oh and Uplay... enough said.Have fun ːMMForFunː			"

												This game is very creatively made. It's not one of those games where theres just one way to solve a problem and you have to find it; rather, you are given tools to shape the environment that cause gradual butterfly effects that are sometimes not what you expected and no two soltions will be exactly alike because the environment is constantly changing and adjusting in response to your actions. This creative platform tickled me a lot; I've never seen another game quite like this. Some levels were challenging and frustrating but satisfying in the end; others were a little easy but over all it was well balanced. It was a joy to see what creative challenge came up next each time. My only complaint is that the game is short -- I would love to see more! Also its replayability is limited. I'd definitely recommend it if you are looking for something different and/or short and sweet.			"

												From Dust presents an interesting way to sculp the Earth, though with a poorly made PC port.In From Dust, you control villagers like in Populous. You can manipulate earth, water, and lava to reach village points and to reach the next level. The goal is to find out where these villagers came from. As levels progress they start in island places with lots of water, next to big volcanoes, or in a stretch of dry desert. The villagers have a unique appearance to them, along with their art and music being of unique looks. Controlling matter is easy and the land and water physics is handled very well. These points add for a special experience.The problem lies with the later PC release. As this was made for consoles it wasn't well optimized. Ubisoft requires to use their DLC along with Steam just to use it. The performance is abysmal, but the art and music are sure to please. While the game has a unique artistic and realistcally amazing design, the PC framework just doesn't do justice.			"

												The game works fine and has interesting game mechanics, primarily the control of natural elements like fire, lava etc. but the novelty of the levels wear off and it just doesn't feel like an accomplishment when you finish a level. I was left more infuriated at the lackluster controls, which seem like they were made for controllers not a mouse, and the repetitive nature of the game. There are challenge modes aside from the main missions but there is no definite ""zing"" with anything this game does (aside from the awesome sound and ambient music). It seems more like an experiment than a full-fledged game. This was definitely originally intended for console gaming and not PC. You'd do well to watch some gameplay videos before going for a purchase and even then I'd recommend waiting for a sale. Also, UPLAY DRM ALERT!! Functional, but shallow and uninteresting.			"

												A rather short game but fun all the way down. It is as fascinating to watch as it is to play. The fantastic idea gives you the power of being the protective creator of a tribal group of people by modelling nature and landscapes. Even if the main action of piling up and excavating the level's territory may not sound spectacular, I already played it through several times. Not least this is due to the physics which grant sensible effects from all my godlike actions. You have the power over lava, earth and water with which you can shape the landscape in favour of the tribe. The goal is to create a save passage over the map to some ruins which grant access to the next scenario. In this sandbox nature is your persistent opponent. If you are not careful fire burns your village down or flood washes your people away.A real downside of this game is the story. Actually there is no notable plot which could be called a storyline. Other than the campaign you can also play in custom empty map where you can build your own landscapes.It has also to be stated, that the game requires UPlay since it is an Ubisoft game.So it is a game that is different. Unfortunately it is not complete, neither by its extent nor by its plot. Nontheless, it reminded me as well of endless hours in the sandpit during childhood. Not least thanks to the still pretty graphics I recommend this terraforming god game.			"

												It's no ""Populus: The Beginning"", but it does well.Some interesting puzzle mechanics, but it just doesn't feel too deep, and certainly feels to short. So if it's something that's somewhat challenging.Artwork is great and is probably the strongest point of the game. It's a shame that you often can't appreciate it as you're mostly staring at it from afar.It's certainly worth your time and money for an update of Bullfrog's epic ""Populus: In The Beginning"", even thought the reworking on shines a veneer rather than get anywhere near the depth of its spiritual predecessor.

Turns out Ubisoft has this terrible ""UPlay"" DRM garbage like Origin, Battlenet etc. that makes you sign into a bunch of extra stuff, extra processes running on your computer for no good reason, forced to be online to play, etc. etc. SAVE YOUR MONEY DON'T BUY THIS DRM TRASH.UBISOFT, you will never get another red cent from me!

												This was a pretty terrible game. I got it mostly because it reminded me of Black & White, but that should have warned me as Black & White was also released a barely functioning sandbox as opposed to a game. I got through everything the game had to offer in less than five hours, but that is because all it has to offer is environmental sandbox manipulation and no matter how much you call them puzzles that doesn't make them puzzles. I concede that the game looks and sounds beautiful, but its an extremely shallow beauty with no depth whatsoever. This is of course aside from the issue with Uplay that might render the game unplayable for most people. This is of course aside from the fact the game is meaninglessly locked to run at a lower frame rate to match those of the console versions.You can find the full review over here: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2016/07/from-dust.html.

												I played this game on console, and I bought it for Steam the instant it went on sale. Not because it's not worth the money, but because it was the second time I was purchasing it. (well, and it's short, so buying on sale is probably the better bet for that reason as well) This god-style puzzle game is just gorgeous. A beautiful, atmospheric, absorbing and utterly enjoyable game that will captivate you while offering progressively more difficult tasks to advance your tribe through the various stages of their evolution. The interface is intuitive, the puzzles are sophisticated and yet gentle in their difficulty curve - but there is DEFINITELY a curve, they will get tricky - and the story while fairly barebones is one that gives you some cause to get attached to these little guys as they deal with the struggles ahead of them. I have not had to use mouse and keyboard on the later puzzles of course, but I could see where you might prefer a controller - it's definitely a comfortable and pleasant experience on the console. I strongly recommend this game!Fair warning: This game requires Uplay to use - if you don't want to deal with the Ubisoft DRM system, then this is probably not the game for you.			"

												Installed this again to see if Uplay/Steam is broken as some say. (Oct 2016)Answer is nope, installed, autoupdated, started,, no problems at all.Feel bad for ppl with all the problems, but it's not broken and worth a bad review based on that imo.But Uplay being Uplay I'm not really surprised there's problems around, but it's Uplay in this case that should get the thumbs down,,not Dust.With that said.It's a fairly short game with a bit (sometimes) clunky controls.And it totally lacks setting for graphics. But that's ok, it looks fine on it's own.But I really like this one, it's giving me flashbacks to Black and White and I loved those games.Mold the earth to your liking, help natives get from point A to B. Be a nice ""God"" and put out that fire, build a brige,or not.Grab a fist full of lava and dump it on that villager that's been eyeballing you last week?,, it's all good.I like to play around in the game, rather then just do this,,and done, game lasts longer if nothing else ^^For me it's a game I'll return to now and then and play a bit, just for fun.For 10€ you get your moneys worth, at least i think so.

												First and foremost, as of this review I had no issue installing or playing this game on PC. I played the game on Xbox 360 prior to purchasing on PC.The engine behind this game is something spectacular. The ability to manipulate sand, water, and lava is definitely a really fun mechanic. Rivers will flow dynamically in sand, creating their own path and carving their way into the world (with or without your help). Lava will flow and harden into rock which allows for various other uses throughout the game. Sand will spread out over the terrain in a natural soft and smooth manner.The game is pretty simple, your ultimate goal on each level is to move to the next level. In order to move on, you need to unlock totems. The totems grant additional powers as well as more villages and people. Of course, each totem may have their own challenge to obtain, such as raising the land out of water or using lava to help secure it from threats. There are side objectives to the game, such as collection these minor totems and filling the land completely with vegetation.Although manipulating the elements is fun, it leaves a strong desire for more. Thinking back to games such as Populous: The Beginning, this engine could be so much more in the right hands and it's sad that it's not being used for something greater. Ultimately, expect to get several fun hours of this game, but if you're like me, you'll thirst for something more. If you haven't played Populous, it's over on GOG for $6, which may give you many more hours of a God game experience for less dollars spent.			"

												Really awesome until the last few levels. Before the later stages, it was relaxing, like playing in a sandbox, yet reasonably challenging without being frustrating or punishing. Unfortunately, as I got to the later stages, difficulty arose due to a certain totem being placed in a very tricky, high and near-lava location. You have to rely on the individual pathing of the AI, but there's not much indication if they'll be able to get up slopes (when there's multiple potential routes to a location) so trying to get them to this totem without having them try to cross lava is an exercise in frustration. The AI pathing tends to be annoying to deal with as the stages get harder. Also, depending on how you may have tried to build walls in stages with lava, you may find yourself having spent a lot of time on a stage but in a sitation where you'll have to try to destroy some walls to let your villagers get to a totem. Doing this is tedious because you need to use explosive plants (if you made rock walls). I don't understand the point in letting players manipulate something in such a tedious way instead of providing a less time-consuming method.Overall, dealing with the lava is quite frustrating, especially with how it can completely wipe out villages if so much as a particle touches some of your greenery. I understand having a challenge makes things more fun, but the way this challenge is presented is more frustrating than entertaining, because a small mistake can reset your entire stage progress. Slight variation on the level design and the lava mechanics would've probably made the game fun, but as it is I can't recommend it because of the unpleasantness of the later levels. Challenge should not come from dealing with the stupid AI, and mistakes shouldn't make you feel like you've just wasted a bunch of time, because that's no fun. Towards the end it just became not pleasant to play anymore. It's a shame because the sandbox mechanics are very entertaining to interact with - it's almost like they weren't sure whether they wanted to frustrate players with hard challenges or provide a relaxing, slow-paced sandbox game.

3/10God games like this are usually a blast, but I was really underwhelmed.The Good: It was a really interesting and new idea. Never seen anything quite like it.The Bad: It was too easy to complete though the natural disasters could be a HUGE pain and really screw up your game (as in the level your on, not the game itself).The Ugly: TOO DAMN SHORT!!! I beat the game in under three hours (and that was including a considerble amount of screwing around with playing god) and spent another hour or so knocking out the challenge levels and...that was it.In summation, cool game but not enough content to warrant keeping it.

												Wonderful game! I expected a sandbox game but From Dust turned out to be refreshingly challenging and I just love the smooth graphics and interesting gameplay. I did have some problems with Uplay, as first the game wouldn't launch at all and Uplay was being glitchy. However, it's a common problem with this game and steam community had found a good solution to it, and simply by following simple instructions I got the game working. And it was worth it.			"

												For  short game, it is a decent amount of fun. This is a fun sandbox game that gives you an objective, but you can complete it at anytime and in any way that you would like. I spent a lot of time playing the demo on my Xbox 360, and I really enjoyed it, so I decided to finally get the game for my computer. The AI is decent at path finding, but can get irritating at times with them getting stuck going up a hill when they could much more easily go around. The gameplay changes from stage to stage, adding a new element for each stage. I enjoy that they do this. Diversity really helps this game. I think I may be getting to the end of the game, which is disappointing, but there are challenge modes to tackle after you have completed the main story. Final note: Wait for this game to go on sale if you are interested in playing it.			"

												The world has released yet another Call of Duty clone. I mean seriously. How many Call of Duty clones do we need. Now usually I rant on how this game is a worse version of Call of Duty. But ""Oooohooohoo man"" believe me when I tell ya. This game is probably, no it in fact is, 100% better than Call of Duty. It has such a good multiplayer community, dudes only of course, some of the greatest Multiplayer PvP maps I have seen, and of course, who could forget the sweet graphics this game includes. Now I do now know how to type out how amazing these graphics are. But I'll give it my best shot. These graphics are Real Life. The playstyle is amazing. I love the first person shooter aspect. There is the ability to take cover. And of course, do sweet 1080 quick-scope trick shots.			"

												This game was the biggest waste of my money, and I've wasted money on bad games, believe me. First off, they give you the SMALLEST tutorial on earth with the worst controls ever. Then, after that, they spawn in random characters who you believe you can control but NO! You can move dirt and sand around them. To make things worse, you can't drown them. This game is based around you moving sand around people so these unhelpful, mentally ill and poorly controlled AI can move to a temple. I thought this was going to be a building game because it was titles ""From Dust"". Sounds like a civilization type game, huh? I'd give this game a 1/10 because sometimes you can put the people in sand and watch them crawl out like ants in a hill. Don't waste your money, as this should be a F2P game at best.			"

												I would reccomend this product in it's current state only if you can play through it all in one sitting. If not Uplay crashes after each attempt to enter the game afterward. I would not reccomend this for the simple reason Uplay is even near this product as it as caused this entertaining game to be utterly crippled by Uplay cracking From Dust' spine over it's knee as Uplay monolodges about how it and From Dust are the same. Even though From Dust denies this claim, calling Uplay garbage.			"

												""From Dust is a beautiful game. On maps where I’m not forced to take action quickly, I sometimes catch myself sitting there and messing with the physics of the land, watching how one change would affect all of the other elements on the map. If you’re familiar with the concept of cause and effect and enjoy what if questions and scenarios, then you’d probably get a kick out of this puzzle game.""Full Review: http://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/from-dust/Gameplay Video:

												I DO NOT recommend this game. Ubisoft makes you create/use a uPlay account to log into this game, which is just annoying.. I already log into an account via Steam (Yes I know it's a seperate network, but still.. 'user experience' much?)It IS NOT a spiritual ancestor to Populous because the title itself is fairly limited. It reminds me somewhat of the Black and White series (and a similar one-gimmick game play). If you like pretty graphics and pressing Space Bar, then you'll like this game though. It is about right-priced if you're OK with annoying.Also see: http://www.1up.com/news/from-dust-drm-removal-steam-give-refund "

												NOTHING LIKE POPULOUSThis isn't a god-game, not in that sense. You're a god, sure. With powers over nature, sure. You lead a tribe of people, sure. But this is really a puzzle game. You move dirt and lava and stuff around to make a way for your people to reach new village spots. That's it. Oh and there's no real progression between levels. If that sounds fun, have at it.I expected more, and I guess that's my fault for not reading enough reviews.BUT, the mouse controls suck. I'm four levels in and I still hate how the mouse controls. I regularly pick up water instead of the dirt I want that's next to it. Directing my people to a new spot is hard because getting the mouse to settle on that spot is hard. There's some really weird acceleration going on. And the game forces me to use uPlay. Despite my admission that I shouldn't have bought this game, I think this paragraph still warrants a thumbs down, because I tried to enjoy it for what it is and these frustrations stopped that.			"

												It's like a smaller scale Black & White, without a giant animal. The goal is to guide your tribe to the right place(s) while protecting them from natural disasters. This can be done by changing the environments. So, for example, you can create walls to protect them from lava or you can create a hole in the ground to keep the water in. It's all up to you, as long as you can protect them. But it gets challenging pretty fast.The graphics are pretty sweet, especially for a downloadable game. It definitely has a nice style. The sounds are very well done as well.All in all, it's a game I would recommend. There aren't that many 'God sim' games around these days, so From Dust is a great addition to anyone's collection.[Rating: 77/100]			"

												From Dust is the last game from Eric Chahi (known for Another World and Heart of Darkenss). COntrary to his most famous creations which were side scrolling adventures, From Dust is a God-game. To make this review short, I thoroughly enjoyed it and I spent about 18 hours with the main missions, not touching the challanges, so it has plenty of content to keep you satisfied. Plus the game looks amazing. The only gameplay-related minus is the lack of a sandbox mode, but that's alleviated by the fact that the last mission is exactly that: a sandbox mode. Though I think it should have been a separate mode, not locked at the end of the campaign.Now, to speak a bit about its technical problems. I will start by saying that I had absolutely no problem with any of the problems most people bring up when talking about From Dust, and I wholeheartedly recommend it.Its most common problems are:- bad mouse and keyboard controls. I was not affected as I played with a gamepad. If you own a gamepad (and most PC users do nowadays), do yourself a favor and play this game with it. It wills ave you a lot of frustration and it will help you enjoy the game.- locked framerate. Yes, the game is locked at 30fps and there are no excuses but: it hasn't bothered me at all since this is an incredibly slow paced game. In this case 30fps is completely acceptable and doesn't realy break the game or the immersion in any way.- uPlay. Everyone and their mother are complaining about uPlay. It didn't bother me at all, and to be honest I don't see how anyone that isn't a kid would be bothered by it. It is just another UI layer that didn't bother me at all. It just loads with the game and remains in the background while I play. Just like steam. To be bothered by one but not by the other is completely immature in my opinion.- Always online DRM. By the time I played this game, Ubisoft removed always online DRM so right now this is a non-issue.If you like god-games, do yourslef a favor and play From Dust. It's not really as good as the pold Populous games (nostalgia may be a factor in my case), but it is still pretty good and offers a lot of content. The game is also pretty cheap nowadays (you can get it in a sale for 5 dollars or euros).			"

												I'd recommend this game but with a couple of major reservations.First off the good.I think the core mechanics are neat and well executed. Moving terrain around and using it to affect the lives of the indigenous population is great fun. The fun for me at least partially stems from my sense of nostalgia of playing in the backyard and digging out villages for my populations of action figures to live in. Also, I have a weak spot for games in which physics manipulation is the basis of the mechanics.Now for the badFirst off screw uPlay. This game somehow got deleted from my uPlay account so now I can only play it in offline mode. However I can't inherently judge the game for that failure, just Ubisoft's publishing policies. Buyer beware, I guess.Second, it feels like a console port. There's minimal graphics options. The controls are awkward and become a hindrance on the later, faster paced levels. The menus are unpolished and make it a pain to navigate between level selection and other important features.In conclusion I liked this game but there are some major issues with it's packaging. If From Dust was remade or they made a sequel that controlled better, operated better on the PC environment, and didn’t include mandatory uPlay integration, then I would definitely be able to recommend it.

												Okay I played From Dust a while ago on my Xbox and fell in love with  it and now that I've gotten into PC gaming I was so excited to see that there was a PC version. I highly reccomend it to anyone who loves god games HOWEVER. In order to get it to even run I had to delete the Ubisoft launcher files from my computer and then go onto the Ubisoft website and download the Uplay launcher from there. Now it actually works. So I do actually reccomend the game, but bear in mind that you will need to do a bit of finangling to get it to work, but the game is totally worth it!			"

												the interface is very hard to work. the screen moves with the mouse which makes persice interaction with objects hard to adabt to. i got it on sale but it certainly wasnt worth it. if the screen was more like age of empires or civilization in which the screen moved with edge scrolling it would be much better.

												The game itself is great... the fact that Ubisoft put it's Uplay DRM back in this means everyone should stay as far away as possible from this! Definitely can't recommend it with Uplay. In fact, this is the SECOND freaking game I can't access anymore because of their stupid Uplay stuff (the other being ACIII, a game I've logged 20+ hours in, yet can't finish because apparently it got magically removed from my Uplay account).As a result, I won't be buying any Ubisoft games with Uplay anymore, because apparently either my account got hacked or Ubisoft regularly messes up big time with no way for me to get my access back.Consider this a fair warning for anything involving Uplay. It's a shame though, because From Dust itself is actually quite an amazing god game / puzzle game.			"

												I had a good few days invested into this game because, you know, I like to take my time with new concepts, especially if they are pretty.  This game has a lot to offer in terms of beauty and inspiring animations where it comes to the forced generated into the environments.The problem is that this game feels like it was supposed to be more, couldn't reach its high-end goals, and so settled for being a simple puzzle game.  I wanted to care about the little tribes people, but, because I could really do nothing more meaningful with them than build them paths and tell them to go somewhere, they never really became all that endeared to me.  I mean if they had even been better programmed to be more interactive just with one another and their environments, it would have been sufficient for me to feel like an actual all-powerful god watching over my people.  Fact is, they just threw up cookie-cutter village spheres and then sat around waiting for me to do something.  I would have greatly enjoyed watching them fish and farm and hunt or just about anything which made them feel alive to the gamer.  I really think that, with the bare bones nature of your godly influence in the world of From Dust, this game needed more content and variety within its little living world.Anyway, going from scripted event to scripted event works well enough for a FPS or arcade modes in other genres, but it does very little for a game like this, in my mind and while many of the natural disasters you are trying to aid your little pointless people in surviving are rather glorious, they actually leave you, a god, feeling rather small and futile when faced with their might and splendor.I wouldn't really recommend this game for more than a cursory playthrough and a few moments of drooling over the fluid physics.  It's pretty, but its pretty blank as well.			"

												I purchased this game as it was proported to be the next Populous: The beginning.In short - it is not worth it.The gameplay is similiar in that you are a god, seeking to terraform the world to achieve your goals.There is rarely enough dirt to be creative with your terra forming.It leaves you feeling unfulfilled. You could wreak so much havok! But no.Even though this game had promise it missed the mark.Having said that the 'crater in a volcano' world was quite fun and, I think, the best in the game.If you could get this game for under $5 it would probably be worth it, but much more than that, I suggest purchase another game.

												This game's rating is criminally below what it deserves.  Yes, it requires UPlay but at this time and age UPlay is just a minor inconvenience and the lockup issue is well documented and easily fixed.  Eric Chahi is a gaming genius and I wish he made more games.  From Dust is a worthy entry in the sandbox god-game genre.  It's not another Populous if that's what you're looking for here, it's a game about a deity that protects its tribe against the forces of nature as they trace their heritage across a harsh world.  It's admittedly short but that saves it from overstaying its welcome.  It's novel and fun, and the visuals are something you just have to experience.  You will not regret playing this game.			"

												Very similar to other god games I’ve played, but with the ability to alter the landscape, but not in a click-and-drag sort of way, but in an elemental sort of way. For instance, if you want to create a river, you don’t just press a button and a river appears. Instead, the games says “♥♥♥♥ you, if you want a river, make a river. Move the water, drop it and let it carve trough the land, like a real river you lazy piece of ♥♥♥♥!”The game lets you experience erosion and land forming in a realistic way, with fun challenges.

And the little people are so sympathetic that you'll try your best not to drown/burn/suffocate them.

												I purchased this game as it was proported to be the next Populous: The beginning.In short - it is not worth it.The gameplay is similiar in that you are a god, seeking to terraform the world to achieve your goals.There is rarely enough dirt to be creative with your terra forming.It leaves you feeling unfulfilled. You could wreak so much havok! But no.Even though this game had promise it missed the mark.Having said that the 'crater in a volcano' world was quite fun and, I think, the best in the game.If you could get this game for under $5 it would probably be worth it, but much more than that, I suggest purchase another game.

												In order to enjoy this game, you must give it some time at first. This is a God game where you can manipulate elemants, you manipulate these elemants in order to get your tribe settled to a village. You manipulate the ground below them in order to clear paths for them, so they can continue spreading their knowledge across the land. I would have to say that this game has fantastic replayability due to the fact that you can finish a level differantly each time you play it.The description of the game I've given in the review is a very basic description, give this game a try yourself, you must see the beauty this game has to offer with it's stunning visuals.

												Even though I personally like this game, I will try to stay as objective as I can.I am recommending this game because there is nothing like this out there and it is worth experiencing. BUTThere are lots of CONS:-	Game is super short.-	The controls are unfriendly.-	Can’t skip scenes.-	No depth, no challenge.-	Only thing worth seeing is the physics.Seems that this game was a let’s-release-a-game-with-cool-physics” but nothing else. It is a lot of fun to play with the elements and see how you can affect the world. But that’s it.As far as all the negative comments concerning UPlay: ignore them. UPlay is UPlay, and From Dust is From Dust.  Even if UPlay were so bad (entering a key and logging in, not a hate-trigger for me), they are two completely unrelated things. So, if the game is on sale and you enjoy god-like games, physics/cause-effect, give it a go. I personally felt like “is that it?” at the end. So expect that if you like these sort of games.But still, the concept is good and this is the only game out there where you can manipulate the world like this, and it’s fun. So + for me. "

												I bought this game a few years back and I enjoyed it for a while.Every now and again I look at it in my games library and think ""That might be fun for a bit"", so I start it up and remember why I'll never play it again.Ubisoft Uplay... that horrible invasive DRM... From Dust is infected with it, ruining the entire game. Ubisoft will tell you that it's okay, now the game is patched, you can play offline and never expeirience a breakout or interruption. What they don't tell you is you must keep Uplay installed and authenticate all the time. The last time I signed in after a long absence ""From Dust"" was no longer in my games library on Uplay... as much as I enjoyed the game it simply wasn't worth the time and frustration for me to deal with Ubisoft to fix it.Until you can trust Ubisoft to release a copy of From Dust without UPlay AT ALL... it simply isn't worth your time.

Even on the slowest mouse speed setting available, the mouse still quickly darts around way too much and is nearly impossible to click where you want to because the cursor is constantly moving.

												It's a fun toy for playing with fluid dynamics and it has a couple interesting puzzles in its levels, but it overall lasts only an afternoon or two's worth of time. It can last longer if you REALLY like playing with the tools it gives you, especially on the unlockable sandbox, but at the time of writing this the game is over three and a half years old and is still the price it was at launch, which was too high then. If this goes on sale for $5 it's an easy purchase as long as you go in thinking of it like a toy  instead of a game.			"

												Nice little sandbox that is good to idle away a few hours. In story mode you lead your tribe through a number of terrains trying to populate totems, which grant certain powers and which you need to complete the level. Once you got all the totems, you can continue to the next level. There really isnt a story as such though, but sust some cutscenes (which you cannot skip) with some esoteric blah blah. There is also a challenge mode in which you have to reach certain objectives which I found rather boring. But still, worthwhile enough to buy.			"

												Do NOT buy this game in its current state!  Not only is it an absolutely terrible console port (no video options outside of resolution, capped at 30 FPS, god-awful mouse and keyboard control, and much more), it is poorly optimized and includes Ubisoft's infamously terrible DRM.This would merely be 'bad' (and, really, expected of Ubisoft's PC releases) if not for the fact that Ubisoft outright lied to its customers about what kind of DRM it would have.  An official post on the official forums explicitly and pointedly said it would not have this DRM.  Furthermore, it was not revealed until after the game was released that it would only run on a very limited number of GPUs.This is a perfect example of what a company should not do to gain fans, especially among the somewhat picky PC crowd.  A beautiful game with an interesting concept and low price tag marred by what is quite possibly the worst port ever, with the 'features' of draconian DRM, shoddy optimization and unnecessary UPlay.

												This game is very weird. Totally didn't expect it. You have your little villagers that you send to one of four totems in each world.  Once all four totems are settled, you can move onto the next level. What makes it hard is the tsunamis, volcanos, flooding, and such that destroys your villages. You have to pick up sand from around the map and create walls and pathways over rivers to get to the totems. The game is about not managing the villages themselves like a civ game, but more protecting them by redirecting the elements.It wasn't bad, but I only got a few hours out of it. If it's cheap, I'd get it. You don't get the 'free to create' sandbox by the end though, and I had enough of the game once I got there.			"

												I was quite excited for this game, even though it is from Ubisoft.  I was hoping for something creative and sandboxy, but it ends up being extremely linear and you can only play with what they want you to play with.  There is no sandbox mode, just a somewhat frustrating story (Like when you get to the fire tree level) and challenges (which are only unlocked by playing the story mode.The game looks terrible on PC..  Very limited graphics options and 30fps cap.  It doesn't seem to run very smooth for me either.  My biggest issue with From Dust are the controls.  It doesn't have the typical RTS type feel.  Your curser is very sluggish with all the objectives that require quick mousemovements, it is very frustrating to get your ""breath"" from point A to point B.  Also, you move both your curser and the entire screen with the WASD keys, while moving your mouse only gives you a small amount of room to play around before the entire screen moves.

												This was a fantastic experience. I was sorry it was over. The Uplay thing is a nuisance but I needed it for Far Cry 3 and a few other games that were good so I don't see why people make such a fuss and work so hard to drive other players away. From Dust worked fine for me. Shaping the terrain to change the flow of lava and such is a new kind of thing in gaming so I went to the many youtube videos that show how its done and got lots of good tips to finish all the levels. Other levels could be solved using logic. There's not much replay but there could be if they let people create their own levels in workshop.			"

												This game is easily a good time killer but watch out for losing site of your priorities having fun with the sand and water mechanics. I spent a lot of time making pools and lakes and making them drain from one place to another for pure entertainment even though it was not my objective. Basically you have to get your tribe memembers  from point to another to create small villages, make sure the land becomes lush with greens, and finally getting them safely to an exit. You use your powers as a god to take control of the elements to change the very shape of the land your tibe member are currently inhabiting. Pick up and drop sand to make a crude land bridge or drop water on some vegitation which has caught fire due to the constant lava flow from an active volcano or have your tribe members grab totems to protect you from raging a tsunami. There are intricate ways the game dev make use the landscape and element mechanics to insure getting your tribe memembers to saftey will not be easy.			"

Every bit as good as Journey, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bullsh*t DRM crap that installs with it can suck on a greasy turd till it chokes to death. FuQ Ubisoft. You screwed this one up with your dumb sh*t._______________________________________________________________________________You're some kind of tribe dude with a horn, and you blow it and manipulate the elements to get more powers to manipulate more elements. None of the levels are terribly difficult. The controls leave  a bit to be desired and the lack of video options (the game looks low-end hd and doesn't scale) is a poorly conceived corner to cut. _______________________________________________________________________________Don't buy it yet.

												Some people deserve to die.In the case of 'From Dust' its your ♥♥♥♥ head worshipers. How they die is up to you. This game is really great if you just wanna sit there and watch a landscape change. Lava cuts canals through the land like a fifteen year old with a razor blade, Tsunamis wash in and drown countless masked villagers like so many forgotten toddlers and fire tears through bark huts like a fat women at the buffet. its also got a neat puzzle solving aspect to it. The only problem with the game, however, is that unlike other god simulators (Black and white 1 & 2) you can't directly interact with your villagers. Where in Black and white you could cathartically hurl idiot villages against ♥♥♥♥ because they angered you, in 'From dust' all you can do is sit and watch and hope they dont develop better path finding before the next tsunami hits.

												Fun for a four dollar puzzle game. It skirts the line of being a tech demo instead of a full game though. There's only one, fairly long and unskippable, cutscene after every stage. I would have liked to see at least twice the number of story missions, some variety in people, and a mind bender or two for the puzzles.Overall, good buy when its on sale, not so much for full price. There's little story, limited variety, and irritating controls at times. On the other hand, it's absolutely beautiful and fluid dynamics play very well into eachother. The challenge mode adds much needed objectives to test your understanding of the mechanics.			"

												From Dust is a gorgeous game with an interesting concept of playing god and encouraging the growth of your tribe as it recovers its memories and re-establishes itself.  The controls are a bit difficult to get a grasp on at first but are easy to use once you have the hang of it.  The game itself is visually stunning with detailed shots of the landscape and your tribe.  However, the game has been difficult to play for longer than bursts of ten or fifteen minutes without those same beautiful visuals slowing and eventually freezing my computer until the game shuts down or has to reboot.  My computer has never had these kinds of problems with games before and I am usually patient enough that if I can get a good amount of play time in then I don't mind.  From Dust, however, shuts down too frequently to really do much in a playing session.			"

												This game is easily a good time killer but watch out for losing site of your priorities having fun with the sand and water mechanics. I spent a lot of time making pools and lakes and making them drain from one place to another for pure entertainment even though it was not my objective. Basically you have to get your tribe memembers  from point to another to create small villages, make sure the land becomes lush with greens, and finally getting them safely to an exit. You use your powers as a god to take control of the elements to change the very shape of the land your tibe member are currently inhabiting. Pick up and drop sand to make a crude land bridge or drop water on some vegitation which has caught fire due to the constant lava flow from an active volcano or have your tribe members grab totems to protect you from raging a tsunami. There are intricate ways the game dev make use the landscape and element mechanics to insure getting your tribe memembers to saftey will not be easy.			"

												Excellent and challenging non-violent game. You must figure out how to provide for your tribe and how to lead it across various terrains  and avoid numerous environmental dangers. Requires analytical skill in order to access best way to get the job done. Play gets progressively harder as different dangers from land, sea and plants appear. You must settle new villages next to the totems in order to unlock new powers for your avatar.  Lead your people across the land following the path of the ancients while gaining power and abilities. Non-violent and age appropriated for the entire family.			"

												I love god simulators, and once upon a time, this game gave me some satisfaction. Then the game required Uplay, then it couldn't run at all.I've never seen a game become more broken with age like this game has. Every level feels identical, bar having maybe one different obstacle or challenge. Transitions are repeated, the story is non-existent, and did I mention this game is broken? I played this game years ago when I was a kid, and it ran fine. It ran a bit slow on my laptop, but it functioned. I could get by. Here I am on a superior laptop years later, and the game crashes on the first level.Ubisoft... ya're eff ups; everywona ya. You broke god. Not just any god. Me god. Me. To be fair, I'm 90% certain that beating the final levels of this game wouldn't have given a satisfacting ending. And the only reason I couldn't get that far was because the later levels had so much crap going on at once that it overheated my laptop. It was the first, and one of the only games to do that.			"

												Sure, you might say that this game is a little pricey, but Ubisoft could have charged so much more for it and have got away with it, From Dust could have been at the really high end prices, but it didn't need to, as they knew it would still make so much money.Steam did have some problems with it in the past, but to my knowledge, they are fixed now and certainly it is worth jumping in and getting it.You will be pleased with what you have bought, the graphics arent perfect, but that doesn't matter as long as you don't zoom in on your people, otherwise you won't even notice, you should at least watch Flabaliki's letsplay it's quite good to get to have a look at what you're going to buy, it is a God game, which I only found out when I watched the letsplay, so it's allways good to have a look at YouTube to see if there are any letsplays.It's a lovely game really, it has some grat reviews so if you have a birthday coming up soon then it is worth looking at it.Well done Ubisoft			"

												A very quirky god game which I bought on the strength of the author's nostaligc back catalogue. Its a god sim in which you rise and fall the earth/rocks/water to build small civilisations but are at risk of fire, floods and natural disasters. In many ways, the technology behind the game is more impressive than the game itself which is kind of odd and perhaps a missed opportunity? It's not a game that will thrill you, but if you like unique and different then its worth a look if the sales are on. There are some annoyances, like the inability to skip the cut scene intros to each level, but its a solid 7 out of 10.			"

While this is similar, I shouldn't have expected it to be the same game.  It does provide it's own challenges, but I found it to be very boring.  Tell your people to go here or here.  Make sure they don't drown while they do their song and dance.  That's the gist of what I got with my few hours of game play.  No depth.			"

												ARG.  I like this game. so much that Ive bought a total of three times. But I don't know if its the dev's screwing with me or the game itself just codes itself to ♥♥♥♥ on your experience but each time I get this game it tells me after a month or so that i need to repurchase it. i have spent my $20 on the browser, google play and steam version. and was surprised that I cant even play the steam version anymore.   Aside from that, its a game where you play a god like being. without the whininig of human natures. Controlling the elements and forming the world to a purpose is fullfilling even though the games pace is quite slow...The reason I'm not guna recommend this though is because I'm starting to think this is more a cash grab then anything..

												If you've ever play Populous: The Beginning you'll like this one.  Basically zero control over the citizens, but instead you control the elements.

												This game is full of interesting scenarios. It starts you out fairly simple, but eventually leads you to repelling entire oceans in order to keep a meager hold on your civilization. I have not taken the time to beat this yet, as the later levels are frustratingly difficult.It's only downside is that the pathing of the A.I can be a little silly sometimes, taking a longer - and thus more dangerous - route simply because a little of the dirt you so carefully placed was too high for him to climb.I say that everyone should at least try this game and then decide from there if you want to buy it or not. :D			"

												A pros and cons list about the game itself. Enough ♥♥♥♥ has already been said about Uplay.Pros:- The physics engine works beautifully. Making an island, topping it with a volcano then dowsing it with a monster tsunami is rarely this satisfying- Stylish, chill and with gorgeus graphics- audio and atmosphere- Straightforward game mechanicsCons:- The mouse (""the breath"") control takes some getting used to (bad console -> pc port)- Idiotic tribesmen (will blissfully run into the path of an oncoming lava flow or get stuck on a slope and refuse to budge)- campaign is a bit short- Locked 30 fps is a little annoying- (Uplay, if it gives you trouble)Overall, probably best god game I've played so far. 7/10			"

												U-play is terrible, most people know that, but since this is a review of the game itself I'm going to be looking past that for those who are just interested in the game.From Dust is beautiful, it can be challenging without being so difficult as to be stressful which I feel would detract from how pretty this game is. The mechanics are nice, and honestly some of the sounds in the game are downright soothing. I also found that while occasionally I'd get frustrated when the villagers made poor choices with their route, in general I actually wanted to protect them, again because the game isn't rage-quit inducing.So yes, I'd recommend the game itself, but due to the compulsory U-play I most likely won't be playing more now that I'm done with the main story since I just want rid of U-play. As with many others I purchased this game when the U-play DRM had been removed and then I went back to it and it was there. It's sad really that such a wonderful game is let down by something like this.TL;DR: From Dust is good as a game in and of itself but obviously U-play is rubbish.			"

												Seems alot cooler than it really is, extremely lackluster. 45% recommended 55% not Before I bought it, I originally thought it was a god sim, but all you do is pick up a small amount of 1 of the 3 kinds of  elements (water,sand,lava) and drop it somewhere else. Such as picking up sand to block a wall of water, or sucking up some water so the uncontrollable villagers can make an uncontrollable village. Basic Gameplay: Once you make it safe, they will create this little outpost that generally gives you some kind of element manipulation buff such as evaporating all the water on the map. The outposts dont change at all. They only have to be protected from the elements. Your objective on every mission is to inhabit every outpost to proceed. Each mission has some sort of unique obstacle that sometimes requires thought to beat. Inbetween these missions you are  rewatching the same cinematic over and over. Thinking about it, it feels like an antfarm sim because you move elements around while you watch the ants do their own thing. Missions are easy. It is a good idea, 'meh' execution. Price should be somewhere around $10, $15 is steep. Pick it up on sale. One of those games that I dont regret playing, but should've passed on.			"

There's probably a fix if you dig deep enough, but from what I remember of the gameplay, it was a fun time waster but not worth putting in extra effort to try and find and implement some workaround.

												Found this to be quite an enjoyable game. The aim is to help the tribespeople establish villages in each level with you playing as a godlike figure who can pick up and deposit earth, fire and water to help them. Its quite interesting because theres no traditional enemies but rather nature itself is the enemy with tsunamis and volcanoes etc making your progress difficult but you can also manipulate them to your advantage. Some levels are quite challenging without ever being punishing.Good points:- Interesting idea where you have to fight and manipulate nature itself to beat each level.- Theres also a challenge mode where you have can beat challenges in the fastest time possible.- The game has a nice look and feel to it and reminds me a lot of the Populous game.Bad Points:- Requires Uplay- Gameplay gets a bit repetitive towards the endOverall this is a decent game might be worth picking up if you enjoy godlike or puzzle games. Though the Uplay factor might put some people off.			"

												From Dust brings the term sandbox game into a whole new meaning.  You are literally dropped into a giant side box.  A sandbox that you can control and manipulate in order to help your tribesmen find the promised land.  Developed by Ubisoft, and release in August of 2011.  From Dust gives you god like powers over the elements.The premise here is simple.  With your various powers over the sand, wind, water and fire, guide your tribe from totem to totem in order to unlock a portal to the next zone.  Each level gradually introduces you to new powers and concepts.  The first few levels are pretty straight forward and act as tutorials to help you develop an understanding for the game's basic mechanics and controls.  You can literally take your godly hand and scoop up areas of terrain, or water, or even lava to mold and manipulate the land.As you proceed farther into the game, these powers are used not only to lead your tribe forward, but also to protect them from the earth itself.  Whether it's fire, floods, giant waves or massive eruptions, you must continually alter the earth in order to keep your tribe safe.  This is where the interaction of the various powers comes to fruition.  Though sand can be piled up and prevent waves of water from flooding the area, the force of the water can eventually erode the sand away.  Combining lava and sand can create rock to solve this problem, but accidentally redirecting lava in the wrong direction can be even deadlier.This balance of powers, and the addition of various power ups as well map unique quantities like hidden underground springs and other surprises keep you adapting often.  The maps often adapt as well.  Several levels in From Dust change part way through and throw new obstacles your way.  In a first play through these events create greater challenges as now your well planned out modifications to the world need to quickly be changed before your tribe is flooded, or burned alive.The look and feel of the earth and it's elements is also just a lot of fun to play with.  Terraforming the earth with your various powers is intuitive and the elements react in fairly realistic way.  Water and lava combine into clouds of steam, cooling into ever growing mounds of rock.  Rivers slowly cut their way through sand at the lowest points creating rivers and peninsulas.  It's truly a wonder to just play in the sandbox that is From Dust just to see what will happen.Throughout all this, a charming story of the cycle of life unfolds.  From Dust is definitely a game you want to give a full play through of to gain the full experience.  The beautiful graphics and physics hold up today against more modern games.  The story, though a relatively simple one of life and death is told mostly visually as you proceed from level to level.  This is a great game, and a gem to try if you have a chance.			"

First of all, to get it out of the way, this game needs UPlay, and it's best to run it from the actual UPlay app for PC, you won't run into any of the launcher issues that you'll hear about.OK, the review:From Dust is a beautiful game, and another pleasure-button hitter for those of us that love this type of ""God"" game.  You control ""The Breath"", which is basically your cursor, and it can suck up different types of matter and drop it where you like.  Using this ability, you get your Lemming-like tribe to be able to find certain areas that unlock certain things.The story is...different, but doesn't get in the way, mostly it's about the puzzles.  You'll have challenges you have to accomplish before you're able to complete the map, and also there's extra stuff you can sometimes find that give you perks of some variety.  Some hazards you'll have to overcome are static, like a river you must divert; others are dynamic events that can impact the whole map.All in all, if you have a decent system, don't mind UPlay, and love the genre, From Dust is worth it, best on sale.

												A little dissapointing, but still a half decent puzzle sim The same cut scene everytime you finish a level gets annoying after the 3rd or 4th time, the controls are awkward at the best of times. And getting it to run smoothly is more challenging than the game itself. The voice actor in the promo is not in the game and the voices in the game gets annoying as hell.Sold itself as an interesting gritty shamanistic tribal sim... it fails to deliver on all counts.  A dull, childish, puzzler that has more in common with lemmings.2.5 / 5			"

												As far as ""God"" simulation games go, From Dust offers a unique twist on the genre. The physics based environments and puzzles offer a great variety in gameplay, allowing you to choose how YOU want to finish the level. The graphics are lush and amazing to look at, I'll find myself just admiring the scenery sometimes rather than doing what I'm supposed to do. I would definitely reccomend it to anyone who's open to this kind of game. The only hangup I'd say there is would be that sometimes the AI doesn't quite understand that you've laid out a perfect path for them, and the oftentimes take the much more dangerous route. All in all though that's just a minor hindrance to a great game, especially for only $15!			"

												If you enjoy redundant layers of DRM/login/moreDRM then this is exactly what you are looking for. Ubisoft requires you to login to ‘UPLAY’, Oh BOY! Christ, will these products of incest ever learn that after we pay them for a game we don’t want them to crawl up our asses and demand 37 layers of DRM? Perhaps we could use some service that already is secure but not obtrusive, I dunno, something like steam. Boy, that would be handy to have a service like steam to validate a game.Is ‘From Dust’ good? Who gives a ♥♥♥♥, one more potentially good game ruined by a room full of fat old corporate sycophants who all slap each other on the back for a job well done. Ubisoft if joining my list of EA and THQ, well done jackasses!			"

												The single main negative point first.... this game does use Ubisofts online DRM service, but beyond initially registering your key (which itself is a simple ""Enter key here"" box so not an elaborate task), you just need to be online to launch.The game itself can be summed up in alot less words than the DRM system, ""A lot of fun, providing you got the imagination to enjoy sandbox games"". If you can't play a game without some gruff chap on the radio going ""Get your ♥♥♥ to the neon pink arrow scum!"", don't even bother thinking about this game.The physics on the geology shaping is well done, the graphics are fantastic in places, not so great in others (Console port after all) and regardless to what the trailer may give the impression of the weather sequences are NOT cutscenes, they're realtime events going down that interact with the world as you have shaped it.Just don't go experimenting with volcanos... that often leads to everyone dead in fiery badness :\			"

												I think its a little unfair to judge this game simply by the shortcomings of Ubisoft and their terrible DRM. This game is wonderful.Thankfully someone here in the review section has gracefully provided a very useful guide on how to get the ungodliness that is UPlay to work.So, I'm not even going to talk about that. It is what it is. I never had any problems with it.From Dust on the other hand, is actually an insanely addictive game. My only wish is that it was longer. I absolutely love the combination of simulation god-game and the challenges you are given to overcome. Every time I put this game down, I consistently had the nagging urge to play it more.You can play the game however you like, whether you want to speed through the challenges or take your time unlocking everything (the extra challenge mode levels are unlocked by various things like finding totems on the landscapes or getting 100% vegetation on the current land). The game is a challenge, but there is no time limit for completing the levels and you can take your time if needed. Its actually fairly relaxing. The extra challenge levels you unlock are fun also.The nature simulations are very fun to play with and it controls very well. The controls themselves are very easy to use. I recommend playing this game with a gamepad. (I use the xbox 360 gamepad for windows.) And yes, this game is absolutely gorgeous to look at. The music, the sounds; everything is wonderful. The simulations in this game - the water and volcanoes expecially - are really amazing and fun to manipulate. Its not very long, I completed the main story in about 9 hours, but its a very nice, satisfying experience all in all. I think I may play it over again, and see if I can complete the challenges using different methods. It doesnt seem like any two playthroughs of this game will be the same. I still have many extra challenge levels complete too (there are lots of them).Dont disregard this game simply because the DRM is bad. If you can put up with the bit of extra effort it takes to get UPlay running, I promise this game is worth it. "

												I have never been allowed to play this game. I didn't know I was required to sign up for their website as some kind of DRM mechanism, so I just typed random words into the fields when prompted. By the time I realized my error it was too late: Steam couldn't help (they have no control over Ubi's DRM) and UbiSoft just didn't bother. No refund, no account reset, nothing. UbiSoft is extremely customer-unfriendly and if things dont go perfectly for you, you will find you wasted all your money.			"

												This had much less content than I expected, wasn't that fun, and was hard to control.  It had really impressive tech, which led to some challenging emergent behavior at times.  The AI was finicky and would get stuck or not do what I wanted, and the portrail of the tribal people seemed a little racist.  Apart from completing the ""story"" mode, the overall objective of the game isn't communicated well, and I didn't know if I finished or not.  It did sometimes have a soothing sandbox feel to it, but it was mostly tedious and it was hard to care about this game at all.			"

												Summary: From Dust is an excellent gaming experiment of sorts that cycles back on itself with its brief yet enjoyable campagin.  You play the rold of a god-esque figure that controls the elements and minimally commands your tribe to do tasks (just some simple ""go here and go there"".  The gameplay is fairly simple at the core though in later levels there is more thinking and fast adjusting/reacting required to ensure the tribes survival.  The learning curve is fairly steady as it adds elements or powers into the mix but I will say near the last level is a bit of a jump in dificulty compared to previous levels.   Graphics:  This game came out 4 years ago from writing this (Aug 17, 2011) and the charm and style still holds up strong.  The dynamic effects are convincing and the character design is interesting.  I do wish they had more animals that appeared to diversify the map but since this is a fairly minimalist game it works as is.  Ocasionally the tsunami effect would catch my attention because of a steap drop off or rise in the water that looked bizarre like a wall of water instead a wave but it is what it is.  Gameplay: Simple and intuitive (played with a xbox 360 controller-needed to be enabled in settings each time)  mainly you are just picking up and putting down materials (sand, water or lava, ocasionally plants or totems as well)  The game is a lightly guided sandbox of sorts where you sculpt the land by changing the flow of rivers and lava flows in order to help a tribe of people reach the exit to the level, this must be unlocked by building all of the villiages on the map which are placed on totem locations.  The level design is spot on with these totems being placed in locations that require you to use different elements and tasks to navigate your tribe but the downside is the AI for these tribe members sometimes cripples gameplay.  I encountered them all to offten crying for help because they weren't satisfied with a path to take or a height difference near them requiring some extra sand raising or lowering until satisfaction.   These poor tribesmen (and women) would also freeze up in terror next to flowing water or lava instead of trying to avoid it which often lead to their demise.Story:There isn't a strong narrative here, essentially the tribe is wondering through different areas/realms with the story cycling back on itself toward the ened.  I will give them kudos for making it work though since the focus here really is just the sandbox gameplay and the minimal aproach they took works fine.  Note:Many slam this game for Uplay issues, I don't think this is fair because Uplay isn't the game.  I am not a fan of running through steam to run through Uplay but it just is what it is, the artists and creatives that shelled out heart and soul into this game created something worth experiencing so don't let the game industry politics soil it for you.

Making an island, topping it with a volcano then dowsing it with a monster tsunami is rarely this satisfying- Stylish, chill and with gorgeus graphics- audio and atmosphere- Straightforward game mechanicsCons:- The mouse (""the breath"") control takes some getting used to (bad console -> pc port)- Idiotic tribesmen (will blissfully run into the path of an oncoming lava flow or get stuck on a slope and refuse to budge)- campaign is a bit short- Locked 30 fps is a little annoying- (Uplay, if it gives you trouble)Overall, probably best god game I've played so far. 7/10			"

I don't know how the guy that made Out of This World ended up making something so drab.Ubisoft installs ""Uplay"" which is a wannabe Steam browser that runs on top of everything to play this game. I'm going to avoid all Ubisoft games from now on.  You need an account name and password, and it tries to keep track of games you've purchased, except half the time it screws up or bugs out.  It was designed by a team of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ monkeys and doing a quick google search nets you thousands upon thousands of hate filled sites, blogs, and forums full of people boycotting Ubisoft.

												A simple god game...or is it? Instead of controling your people like many other games in the same genre, you control the earth, or rather bits of it. You are able to gather up water, sand, and lava in an attempt to shape the world so that your people can survive, thrive, and move on to the next level. Simple, fun, yet can be difficult for some. Great game.			"

												I have never been allowed to play this game. I didn't know I was required to sign up for their website as some kind of DRM mechanism, so I just typed random words into the fields when prompted. By the time I realized my error it was too late: Steam couldn't help (they have no control over Ubi's DRM) and UbiSoft just didn't bother. No refund, no account reset, nothing. UbiSoft is extremely customer-unfriendly and if things dont go perfectly for you, you will find you wasted all your money.			"

												From Dust is an entertaining game that stands out from similar civilization-type games in that you have to craft the land to assist and protect your native people as they go from increasingly inhospitable locations in an effort to find their Ancients who created their world. The story is basic (and not the focus of the game) and there are no real characters besides your virtually identical-looking natives and the only narrative is that which you hear at the begining of each stage. However the voice-over does stand out as it is spoken in a Bahasa Indonesian language that is neat to listen to and don't worry, there are subtitles in English.The real fun comes from the gameplay where you gather up sand, lava, water and more in an effort to keep your people alive and help them to build and maintain their villages in ridiculously dangerous environments such as within the crater of an active volcano, hot damn! These scenarios can defintely be challenging as you will be forced to stop and think in order to plan the best course of terrain alteration or disaster will befall your villagers and you'll be forced to re-examine your strategy or even re-start the stage.I also have to point out the level of realism attached to the various elements in that lava flows like you'd expect, water from tsunamis flows down from elevated portions of the land to pool in recesses, etc. Thanks to this you'll really feel like you're crafting a believable world and perhaps even learn to appreciate how difficult it must be for certain people (both past and present) to struggle against the elements.8/10			"

												Let me start by saying: From Dust is not a god-game and shouldn't be considered as such. It is not Populous (to which it has been compared to in various reviews) or Black & White or even Dungeon Keeper. And this is why people hate From Dust, they compare it to the wrong genre. Although you can't slap your people on the face, drown them intentionally or crush their homes and dreams (well, you can, but then it's game over) From Dust does have similarities to these titles. It has puny little humans and an omnipotent player that controls the surroundings and as such, indirectly also these puny little people. And it is beautiful and it has a physics engine unlike any other game. But in my view, From Dust is most reminicent of Lemmings: guide your people (the puny little humans) to safety via manipulation of the world around them. Raise the earth to create a bridge over water or drain a pond. And it is actually pretty cool. A bit repetitive in the long run perhaps, but a nice niche game.			"

												I haven't been unable to run it the first time I got it, but one day I had a huge hangover, decided to give it a try and it ran without problems. I finished in two days:The gameplay is basically a Lemmings in 3d with the ability to sculpt the Earth.  Physics on the engine are pretty impressive, you get a sense of gravity, mass, erosion, etc. Art fits great, shammanic vibes, tribes are interesting and it's all well rounded with a very organic music and sound effects.Controls could do way better with M+KB, it seems that it was designed to play with a gamepad in mind. In any case, most of the time you'll be just clicking and pressing 1,2,3,4 and/or spacebar.It feels like it was going to be bigger, to me it felt short, I really wish there were more content available. The last levels were great. I'll give it a 9/10 "

												It’s a poorly made port of an Xbox game. The graphics settings are a joke. It’s locked at 30 FPS and it can’t really be controlled by M&KB so a Gamepad is strongly suggested.

												What's the matter, villagers? Can't you pick up lava? I CAN. :DFrom Dust is a God-Game in the same style as Black & White, only without the annoying ""Oh, your creature just ate half your village. Oops,"" bit. You control ""The Breath"", a god-like being with the power to pick up dirt, water, and the LIFE BLOOD OF THE MOUNTAINS. It's your job to protect ""The Men"", a sort of tribal people with spiffy masks.The world in this game is FANTASTIC. Water flows realisticly and wipes villages off the map. Dirt piles up and settles just like if you were a kid playing at the beach. Lava cools into rock when it's not setting fire to everything ever.The AI is a bit crap, though. Many's the time I've created a safe path from one village to another, only for the villagers to take a path right toward the river of molten rock, and THEN proceed to complain until I redirect the flow. But, it's not so bad that it breaks the game.tl;dr, buy the game, it's fun. Cave Johnson, we're done here.			"

												I saw Markiplier had played this and I was enamoured at first sight with it, unfortunately upon downloading it I wasn't aware of the DRM  issues behind it (that apparently haven't been solved after 5+ years) as well as the performance issues; the game's water looks like MSPaint with textures and whenever playing around with sand it'll throw up flat particles that resemble fire graphics from MineCraft.I'm really sorry that the game's in this state, since it looked so promising when I watched Markiplier play it ran beautifully and was enchantingly pretty, but Uplay takes up 1.5Gb of ram on my system and the game itself just doesn't want to work, it'll crash randomly and consistently, the first time just after the intro had ended, the second just as The Breath was unleashed and again a third time for no visible reason whilst terraforming in the second level on story mode.I just don't understand how a game gets left in this state after so long when it looks so gorgeous, but at least now I know why it didn't get a lot of attention. =/I'd still reccomend it, but probably not on the PC version. If it's on the PS3, I might consider rebuying it there to see if it works any better, but as for now I'm hunting for a refund for the PC version.So disappointed.			"

												An excellent game, but not for this price (currently 15 euro's). The imo very short campaign has very little depth and leaves you with a feeling that you're missing out on game mechanics that should've been there. No replayability of the campaign what so ever.Then there's the challenges, but they are very linear, and can only be completed in one way, by doing exactly as intended. These solutions are usually very easy to spot and don't require much efford.In hindsight, I wouldn't pay more than 5 euro's for it, unless they add more game depth, and more levels.Edit: Game uses Uplay launcher, and recently this keeps crashing for me. changing recommendation to no.

												Sure, you might say that this game is a little pricey, but Ubisoft could have charged so much more for it and have got away with it, From Dust could have been at the really high end prices, but it didn't need to, as they knew it would still make so much money.Steam did have some problems with it in the past, but to my knowledge, they are fixed now and certainly it is worth jumping in and getting it.You will be pleased with what you have bought, the graphics arent perfect, but that doesn't matter as long as you don't zoom in on your people, otherwise you won't even notice, you should at least watch Flabaliki's letsplay it's quite good to get to have a look at what you're going to buy, it is a God game, which I only found out when I watched the letsplay, so it's allways good to have a look at YouTube to see if there are any letsplays.It's a lovely game really, it has some grat reviews so if you have a birthday coming up soon then it is worth looking at it.Well done Ubisoft			"

												I thought the game would have more depth.  Honestly it gets boring fast.  It's a good casual timesink, but there's really not much of a challenge or story.  It's just a simple little physics celebration.  I don't know how the guy that made Out of This World ended up making something so drab.Ubisoft installs ""Uplay"" which is a wannabe Steam browser that runs on top of everything to play this game. I'm going to avoid all Ubisoft games from now on.  You need an account name and password, and it tries to keep track of games you've purchased, except half the time it screws up or bugs out.  It was designed by a team of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ monkeys and doing a quick google search nets you thousands upon thousands of hate filled sites, blogs, and forums full of people boycotting Ubisoft.  I already bought the game on STEAM.  Why do I need yet another spyware ridden DRM pile of crap running on my computer?			"

												Interesting experience that reminds a bit of the old Black & White series (also with a bit of Lemmings). A bit unpolished at times but that is only a minor detail.			"

												This game receives a lot of hate that is really undeserved. I have thoroughly enjoyed this game. The only issue I've had with it was the main menu not loading, and that's fixed with a simple game restart. I've enjoyed solving each level by creating mountains, dams, re-directing rivers and lava flow, and the water is very realistic looking, which makes this game all the more fun to mess with. I would definetely suggest getting this game.			"

												This a shape landing game where you need to use landing habilities to go over levels. It reminds me of a modern Populous but not so extent as it. Good looking visuals and decent gameplay.			"

												Realy nice little sandbox like game.Getting pretty hard in the end.Only downside is that, after running it on steam, you will have to run Uplay to then run the game. Stupid Ubisoft.			"

												Engaging puzzle game with a very interesting topic. The puzzles are challenging and the nature of the puzzles is very unique and fun. If you want to get a good puzzle game, you should definitely buy this game.Edit: Because of a uplay update this game no longer works. Do not buy.			"

												Let me start by saying: From Dust is not a god-game and shouldn't be considered as such. It is not Populous (to which it has been compared to in various reviews) or Black & White or even Dungeon Keeper. And this is why people hate From Dust, they compare it to the wrong genre. Although you can't slap your people on the face, drown them intentionally or crush their homes and dreams (well, you can, but then it's game over) From Dust does have similarities to these titles. It has puny little humans and an omnipotent player that controls the surroundings and as such, indirectly also these puny little people. And it is beautiful and it has a physics engine unlike any other game. But in my view, From Dust is most reminicent of Lemmings: guide your people (the puny little humans) to safety via manipulation of the world around them. Raise the earth to create a bridge over water or drain a pond. And it is actually pretty cool. A bit repetitive in the long run perhaps, but a nice niche game.			"

												I haven't been unable to run it the first time I got it, but one day I had a huge hangover, decided to give it a try and it ran without problems. I finished in two days:The gameplay is basically a Lemmings in 3d with the ability to sculpt the Earth.  Physics on the engine are pretty impressive, you get a sense of gravity, mass, erosion, etc. Art fits great, shammanic vibes, tribes are interesting and it's all well rounded with a very organic music and sound effects.Controls could do way better with M+KB, it seems that it was designed to play with a gamepad in mind. In any case, most of the time you'll be just clicking and pressing 1,2,3,4 and/or spacebar.It feels like it was going to be bigger, to me it felt short, I really wish there were more content available. The last levels were great. I'll give it a 9/10 "
