												Can you get past the crashes? If not, sorry, it's likely nothing will get done about it.If you can, has interest for sometime. A few glitches but not game shattering. Design leaves you click-happy after awhile, get's to the point you can't be bothered. At $60m after a few hours, why would you?And consider, at time of writing I am a 1200+ hr Farming Simulator 2013. I am a stayer. This is not an ADHD or twitchspeed teenager here.The crashes.  Did I mention them?Insomnia, Actalogic, UIG.'Nuff said.			"

												Once again Steam has released a game that was not ready to play on Steam. I requested ""tech support"" thru Steam and they granted me an audience 2 weeks later with the standard remove the game then re-download, etc. etc and obviously didn't read my ticket that I carefully typed out to them explaining exactly what it was doing and what the problem was. This game is buggy as hell (before Steam got a hold of it), and they had to have known it was going to be a problem based on the reviews of this game online. Add that to completely incompetant and nonexistant tech support via Steam and you have a waste of money on your hands. There is a group out here on Steam warning people about Steam's refusal to stand behind the games they sell, nor give refunds, nor give store credit, etc. We need to join together with groups like this to demand Steam take better care of its customers and starting appreciating our $ and act like a real store.

-Not Recommended Title- By the look of the screenshots and description of Farming Giant - I thought I'd purchased a great little game. Unfortunately, like so many others, I had a very bug ridden experience...which was a real shame. I've tried the game on Windows XP, 7 and 8.1. Still no luck in having a game without a crash or lock. The gameplay was ok as were the visuals, yeah there could be more development done to it, but I purchased on sale, so I didn't have hugely high expectations.It would be nice, if Farming Giant could be redux'd - in which case, I'd probably return it from my graveyard - and give it a go  again.It's up to you if you buy it - there is some fun to be had if you do.   Score: 4/10 "

												This game is filled with bugs. most can be worked around. i've already invested 20+ hours. Really confusing at first since there is a lack of a real tutorial. There are scenarios, but only one map. The key is to save and save often cause the game will randomly crash. 95% of the time it will be raining so alot of crop can't grow to effecent quanities due to the field being to humid. If you enjoy trying to figure out games that have very low details of what stuff does and you enjoy working with bugs (such as the new simcity) then you will enjoy the game, atleast til it crashes and you realise you havn't saved it for 1/2 and hour and you have to redo a ton of stuff.

												The potential is there for being a great sim, but the fact none of my accumulative orders ever actually ""accumulate"" means that they all fail.

												Farming Giant, for me, was not riddled with game breaking bugs however I still encountered some spectacular crashes with reproduceable causes. My primary complain is that there is no competition; no other farms are trying to service the cities so the only game over is if you spend yourself into a corner. Trying to create a grain farm is thankless and unrewarding, which might be realistic, but it pretty much mandates that you enter into beef cattle or dairy (dairy has a huge ROI). The graphics are pleasant, but the SFX for clicking buildings is obnoxious and the music is wildly out of place for this bucolic setting. Still, if you're a huge sim fan like myself, you can find some fun here.			"

												Do not buy this game. The game is very buggy after you have established a large farm (multiple medium industries). There are no updates or support for the game. Good concept but horrrible and I do mean horrible execution.Pros:- Good Concept.Cons:- Game crashes randomly.- Trucks get stuck at road intersections.- Buildings can get stuck in the ""currently building"" mod and never get completed (but somehow function).- Several errors within the engine that either won’t allow you to set up a service and create a loop that occupies the vehicle until and condition is meet (i.e. truck stuck trying to deliver to town or industry where the contract or reserves are full).- Start location for vehicles can randomly be identified as a town (i.e. vehicles will start from a town and halt all other vehicles spawning from the depot until the vehicle returns to the depot via fields or non-road paths).In, conclusion do not buy this game. I played it, deleted it, forgot about it, and for some reason tried to play it again just to realize why I deleted in the first place. Horrible engine will disappoint you at every possible chance.

												The game would be brilliant for a casual game.However the game crashes. I did all the steps on the support page, which states if the game still crashes go to the developer's page. WHICH IS IN GERMAN ONLY. The developer support page even worst then the Stream one. Overall, I wouldn't buy the game if I knew that it is keeps crashing, and would like a refund, since the game is unstable, and this fact wasn't stated enywhere.			"

												Yeah, my recommendation is don't buy it.  This is the ""Gold Edition""?  More like Pyrite ""Fool's Gold"" and I'm the fool that bought it.The idea is fantastic.  The developer's inability to deliver a game that can actually be played?  Fail.They put time and effort into it, but they didn't finish the job.  It's like a decent looking suit that the manufacturer didn't finish off the seams.  The suit quickly unravels while you're wearing it.If they ever fix the bugs I'd be willing to have another go and possibly change my opinion, but for now, run away.  This game is broken.			"

												IMPORTANT UPDATE: when I wrote the review that you find here, I really hoped in a bit of work from the developer to remove some bugs and improve the game (it have potential!).And happened nothing... really nothing!This game is a good game with too many bugs and ""rough"" point, and it's really sadly to say, I have to change my review and give a NOT recommendation...---I haven't find any bugs of sort about the game: it haven't the best graphics, but it's also a sim/management game, so it doesn't bother me much, and the soundtrack is a bit strange, but still interesting.I understand if someone have problem with bugs, but... some reported bugs are (at least, for the last Steam edition) are simply non-existing!For the rest, it's a simulation deeper than it might appear at first glance.You don't drive machines here, you develop a real business plan, with a consistent number of options and possibility.I't not also a simple game, and this if, for me, a good point.I'm playing it for several hours.Normally, I will give this game a 7, but the fact that it is the only (true) simulation of this kind on the market, allow it to get a point... so 8.

												After playing this game for quite some time, trying my best to avoid the bugs, and framerate issues, I cannot in good conciousness recommend this game.I really, REALLY wanted to like this game, as it reminded me of SimFarm of yesteryear but updated for today's PCs. Sadly, Farming Giant's method of play, has left little excitement in playing one you find out how poor the interface is, and how limited your actual farming operation can be in the early game.The game forces you to have to raise both animals and grow crops in order to level up your ""character"" which would in turn allow you to build additional processing facilities, barn/silo/vehicle sizes and even allow you to sell specific products.  However, I kept finding myself having massive grass shortages due to limited equipment in order to feed my ever-increasing cow population, meaning that I had to continuously tinker with the very-poorly designed vehicle action tools, which sometimes I didn't even know if I had actually selected the correct options to begin with.The interface was not very intuitive and that really hurt the fun aspect of the game. I spent more time clicking around in menus then actually witnessing my farm maintain a somewhat working operation.			"

												 Ok, so this game has the odd issue with crashing, for the scenarios delete the pre-loaded saves then they work fine, then the other odd random crash issue is solved by saving often.Another issue is that there's no vehicle to transport sugar processed from your sugar factories, so as a result you cannot make cakes at your bakery. when Olive's have grown from your orchards you have to send the olives straight to either the city to sell, or an olive press to turn it into oil or pitted olives sadly the barn or a silo won't accept them for some reason. I would personally also like it if the chilled storage allowed you to store milk.There are not many farming simulators from a business point of view out on the market, so if the above issues were addressed this game would be perfect. It does take a little extra patience to put up with the crashing but sometimes you can tell its going to happen (sometimes you will notice the game ""Lag"" a little when running x3 speed, that's your cue to save the game as it will crash in a few seconds).There is plenty of different crops to grow, animals to breed, and you earn achievements which you can spend on the skill tree to boost many different things, driver speed, growth rate of certain crops, breeding rates, have your buildings use up less water/electric. you can build your own wind turbines and solar panels and eventually build a bio-gas plant to turn manure and corn into electric!There are two game modes, scenarios with pre determined objectives and campaign, campaign is a free play mode where you have to ""level up"" to unlock crops/animals and buildings, however the achievements earned, and your level are saved so if you start a new campaign map you don't have to climb the ranks again! so its great if you fancy a fresh start but don't wish to lose your level.I apologise for the rambling, I just wanted to write my own little review on this game as while yes it has bugs, but hey a lot of games do -cough EA cough- it's defiantly worth the price and worth it even better in a sale.

												This game is awesome! There is some issues with crashing, but there are work arounds for this. You just need the patience to fiddle around with it for a while. For me it worked when I deleted all the scenario saves. It works perfectly now, and trust me, it took quite a while to figure out!Even with the bugs, it's worth the price. It's realistic, absorbing, and though the tutorial could be better, it's pretty easy to learn and once you do, it's really fun. Build your buildings, decide if you want to buy or raise your supplies, whether you want to sell live animals or raw products and sell them or if you want to process them first... But remember, the more you have, the more you have to manage... Even if you're just growing crops, you have to watch the water, ph levels, your machinery maitenence... Where you buy your land affects those all... If you love farming, or sim games, or both, you'll love this.			"

												I've been playing this sim for a couple years on Windows XP and now the gold version on Windows 8. I've never had any crashes or issues. This is a sophisticated micro-management game that looks really nice. There is a lot to plan, buy/sell, build, and do on the farm. You need to layout fields, seed crops, fertilize, water, harvest, care for animals, make deliveries, etc. This is a true sandbox and every little bit is up to you. If you like Railroad Tycoon, Roller Coaster Tycoon, Transport Giant, etc., you'll probably enjoy this game.			"

												While it is pretty, it'd be nice if someone with some level of skill in programming actually MADE this game.   NO hotkeys.NO control over field shape.NO bug-fixes.This game's development seems to have concentrated more on making it pretty than making it reliable OR efficient on a graphics card.    It would be awesome if someone made something like this that worked right the first time - the maths in this thing are an unstable joke.  Almost every bug leads to unplayability or a crash later and even all the screenshots they show are non-functional.We don't want pretty, we want playable!  Fixing 10 bugs and making the field shape adjustable would cure this release.That said, short of simAgri this is the BEST farming industry simulator on the market and simAgri is a pay-gated subscription facebook laced flash game.

												This game feels like playing an early access game, As for the game experience itself: There are hundreds off features missing, you have to keep an eye on your supply's because there is no option to prevent trucks from depleting it ntm the fact that u have to check each individual building for its supply which is hazardous ones you have a big farm. Ones u give a truck an order u can not change or stop it until its completed. If u accept an order job for example they want u to deliver ### cows to them.. and if u deplete your supply they wont breed anymore.. and it takes a lot off paying attention and anticipating to prevent this from happening. It has no auto save system which is semi-standart on these type of games. Also vital for crashes and windows update restarting itself in the background etc. The UI is very limited especially regarding where your trucks are, since u can only give them commands when their in the garage and they are usually in the middle of no where without a simple way to check what they are doing and were they are heading.not only did i have to try 3 diffrent solutions to stop it from crashing. The trucks sometimes stop riding and stand at the middle of an intersection untill you save the game and reload the game again.. ntm u will fail your deadlines if u dont notice them getting stuck on another part of the map..Bottom line.. this game had TERRIFIC potential.. but for some reason they, as i would say.. released an unfinished game.. Too bad really.. im hoping there will be a sequal where they will actually ""finish"" this game.			"

												While it is pretty, it'd be nice if someone with some level of skill in programming actually MADE this game.   NO hotkeys.NO control over field shape.NO bug-fixes.This game's development seems to have concentrated more on making it pretty than making it reliable OR efficient on a graphics card.    It would be awesome if someone made something like this that worked right the first time - the maths in this thing are an unstable joke.  Almost every bug leads to unplayability or a crash later and even all the screenshots they show are non-functional.We don't want pretty, we want playable!  Fixing 10 bugs and making the field shape adjustable would cure this release.That said, short of simAgri this is the BEST farming industry simulator on the market and simAgri is a pay-gated subscription facebook laced flash game.

												Like all UIG products there are some great ideas here but the execution is sorely lacking.  Nearly all of their games feel rushed to market with very little play testing for bugs and once they are on the market there seems to be little to no support from this group.  As for this title?  I like the idea behind this game but it is no different than any other released by this group.  It plays very much like a meaty version of the old 90s versison of Sim Farm and it could be a decent game if it were properly fixed and updated.  But as it stands it has a very flimsy tutorial that doesn't tell you much, the game is prone to crashing (the dev will tell you it's your fault despite it being a constant complaint online by many people), the mechanics stop working within the game often (things stop working, machines stop working for no reason, etc), and the game takes micro-managing to the extreme.  Not only do I NOT recommend this title but I very strongly do NOT recommend this title or any other title from UIG.  (and I own quite a few from this group over the years)			"

												The tutorial is one bug after another,i cant complete it,Its a tutorial that you can only complete if you know how to play the game,get your head around that.I only took the plunge because it was on sale for change that fell down the couch,Avoid otherwise,The sad thing is it really had potential for being a great game,either the devs were lazy or just incompetant.

												Farming Giant is a great game with hours of fun. I have played for over 165 hours. I was getting lots of crashes until I deleted 90% of the old quicksaves in the farming giant save game folder.Since the deletion the game has not crashed again.Setting the game to high speed makes alot of bugs. All the fields become grassed over, as I think the game struggles to update the field order menu's.It does become tiresome to build yet another Cow Byre and set up the deliveries, but if you play for an hour a day it is manageable.I find the field management tedious. I have never been able to setup automated spraying and fertilizing. It always seemed to go wrong.A good read is the guide How to Avoid the Issues. I have experienced some of these issues myself.I think it is a good game.			"

												First of all, if I could I would put 2 tumbs up, not because it deserved it, just because it does not deserved a ""Very negative"" review.  I think that a mixed review would be fair.It's not a farming simulation like farming simulator, it's more like a farming management.  You need to buy building, machinery, land and field.  Hire and assign staff.  Sell harvest, product, find contract, etc.  There is no proper tutorial, but that's ok, you need to find out by yourself how the game work.  That is something I enjoyed because it was not easy.  For sure that game have some crashing issues, but not that much.  Save often and it's ok, it won't ruin the game.  Maybe I was lucky.  There is two thing you need to know tough (because - it look like / it's -  a bug).  1 . Paved road is not considered as a road to connect your building, So don't connect to it exept one farm road to let your truck reach towns.2. When you harvest, if you have an error message ""building not connected to road"".  Maybe it is because you didn't assign your harvester to a place where it can unload the grain.In summary, if you saved often and take time to learn the game, you have a good 10$ farming management game.
