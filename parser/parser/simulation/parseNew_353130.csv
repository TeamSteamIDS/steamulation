												I think this game definitely doesn't deserve all the hate that it gets, especially that half of the bad reviews refer to the false start release of the game (delayed, only Russian language), but devs managed to deal with those problems in an HOUR. And they were giving keys to the game so we could play it despite the technical issues with an actual release date. How cool is that?The game itself is simple: you have dragons, you fight other dragons. PROS:+ IT'S FREE. + IT HAS DRAGONS THAT CAN SHOOT LASERS AND MISSILES.+ Flight mechanics are nice and enjoyable.+ It's pretty easy to aim, but not TOO easy, so unless you've never played a video game before, you won't be dying every 5 seconds.+ Different dragons have nice designs (fury <3).CONS:- For now, it's not much more than gaining xp and unlocking new dragons.- Sounds are pretty terrible, dragon's roars are a bit... messy? And there's some voice that says something during the battle, but I can't understand anything of it.All in all, it's a pleasant game for dragon lovers. I hope for more content to come soon. A campaign mode would be awesome!			"

												As much as this game is a cool idea, it's worthless if you can't work out basic matchmaking. I've been put into 1v2 games, 1v3 games, 2v4 games and, amazingly, 1v5 games. I'm not kidding! I've also played against people five times my level, and most games I play have lopsided teams or AFK players.Other issues include unusual, slightly broken English and very weird text layouts. They need to standardize the size of their text, because some HUD elements look messy and unprofessional.A good concept, but not very well executed.			"

												I'm sure you've already read this in other reviews, but just in case: The only reason there are so many negative reviews is because there were some issues at launch. And people found that a good enough reason to riot. After playing for only about half an hour, I can already see where this game is most likely going. I can see a bit of meta forming, and each of the dragons clearly has their own playstyle and purpose. I can't say for sure if this game is going to get better or worse over time - but as is, it's worth an hour or so of your time. It's incredibly easy to pick up (you don't even need to know what any of the keys do the first time you jump into a match. You'll be fine.)  I like how your starting dragon is a bit of a heavyweight. Not the bulkiest of the bunch, I assure you, but they have enough HP so that you'll survive a few of the hits you're no doubt going to be taking while you improve. They're enough of a middle-ground so that you can jump into any of the other dragons with enough basic experience under your belt to know what you're doing. Though I have only played a few games, I'm noticing that I only see about one of a type of dragon per team, which is nice. It's a good indicator that there isn't a clearly broken dragon to play as. Yet. The airplay is a little frustrating at times and momentum doesn't seem to work exactly as it should (I would love to see an update where it's possible to build up a lot of speed and then ram right into them. With recoil, of course. Right now, the dragons don't really feel like they have weight to them.) but it's a solid starting point. That seems to be my all-around opinion on this game, actually. It's hit the ground running with a solid start in it's development and I'd love to see where the devs take the game from here. It's definately possible for this to fall flat, but who really knows? Best of luck to you, devs.			"

												Honestly, It's a great game. There are only only 2 things wrong with this game:-Your dragoon turns faster than your gun-friendly-fire is a thing in TDMI suppose some pros are needed now, hu?-you can get whatever basic dragons you want at the start-each basic dragon is actualy different from one another in looks and how they play-all wepons and items are avalible from the startThat and it's free (at least it is at the time I wrote this :p) so why not atleast try it?

												I found this game from a friend mentioning it and I am overjoyed that happened because this game is pretty damn cool. The biggest reason being that there are barely any games where you play as dragons. It's always slay the dragons and you end up feeling like a ***** because you want to play as a dragon instead.While this is an epic game for dragon fanatics, it can also be for other kinds of people. It's a good game to have on the side since matches are 7 minutes (deathmatch at least) and you can leave anytime as well without being punished.A cool bonus is that there aren't any things to buy with cash yet but that will obviously change but it won't matter to me since I love this game.I recommend playing this with a friend that has already played it for a bit because the tutorial doesn't work yet. It won't let you shoot a turret when it asks you to so you can continue the training. Besides that flaw, this is a good time waster. Not a big time waster like other games but a fun little game to have fun with.I seriously hope this becomes a huge hit over time.			"

												I'm not going to lie. I like this game. It may have had its ups and downs on release hence all the negative reviews but I seriously recommend giving it a shot. The actual gameplay is fun and consists of Free for all and Team deathmatch and the dragons feel like they have weight to them. Story: ?/10There is no story. Just TDM and FFAGameplay: 7/10The game is fun but lacking at this stage and I hope to see the developers make this into a great game.Maps:  7/10 For the time I played this game the maps felt fun to fly though. From flying in a temple to flying high above the map, It felt fun to exploreOther notes- No IRL Currency store which makes this a balanced and skillful game - Easy to hop in and play a match- More content coming in soon such as Riders ontop of your dragon and customization.- Small download so it wont hurt to download and try itWhat I would like to see- Ranked matches. From the 20 minutes I played I had the problem of the opponents being to easy. The games I played I was on top of the leaderboard without trying. If there was a ranked mode to pair you up with players around a certain skill level, I would play this game alot more- 1v1 Arenas. Just a small Circular Dome with a set enviroment for a 1v1 with be amazing to play. It almost feels as if the game was made for it. It would also be nice to add in another arena mode where both people use the same dragon just to make it purely skill based while both having the same skills- Boost. A small boost that lasts 5 seconds and charges over the period of 8-10 seconds would be nice. The flight can get kinda slow when you die and have to fly to the middle of the map. It would also add a new element when fighting someone or escaping rockets.- Party'ing up. A pre game lobby before you go into a game to make sure you and your friends are on the same team. This can also work when or if ranked matches are implemented.Final noteI would give this game a try as it is alot of fun and I look forward to what this game will bring in the future!- MirtP.S I'm aware that the start bit looks a bit rushed. I may come back and fix it up later. :^)			"

												First of all, this game is freaking awesome. I've been looking to play games like this since, I don't know, a pretty long time. Essentially, you play as a dragon created by men, to defeat other dragons. Sounds fantastic now, doesn't it? Let me list some of the pros and cons.pros:- You play as a dragon;- You play as a gun-wielding dragon;- You play as a dragon with a cannon on its back;- You play as a dragon;- Gameplay mechanics are quite fun;cons:- Delay time (?)   I need the devs to clarify this. I don't know if its just me, but the delay time for me is quite ridiculous. I accidentally    pressed "" ` "" in the middle of the game which resulted in a pop up window (basically pause popup with continue and    quit) that could not be closed even after I clicked like a dozen time. Also, I have to wait for -+5 seconds just to have    another popup that I have to wait when I want to quit. If it could be done instantly it would be wonderful.- Chat mechanics   In every game, I always wish good luck to all of the players in both teams. But the thing is, I can't seem to see if the    chat was sent or not. This may not seem like a big deal, but in the future, this is a game-shaping mechanic. If the chat    mechanic is clear, then this would be better. Make it simple like in Dota2 or CS:GO.Improvements:- Environment interactions   The dragons could land and walk instead of hurting when they hit the ground, their fire could burn down trees, they    could hang on the edge of a cliff. These are some examples of envi interactions that the devs could create.- More fx!   Add more sounds when the dragons got hit, add more visual effects when the dragons collided, etc.I think that is it. I know I gave out more pros and cons, but I don't know if I could recommend it in its current state. If the delay time is fixed, it's going to be a great game. Updates of this review could be coming up in the future.			"

												So yeah, neat concept, nice that it's free to play but still a total waste of time.  :/As promises, I played the game again after this latest update. The developers did fix the bugs I experienced prior. However, it appears that the ship of opportunity has sailed for the developers.To really kick this review into gear, let me start by saying this game that only offers PvP with no form of NPC or combative AI is a huge mistake. This game is international based, yet the entire 30+ minutes I flew in circles and I never ran across a single player on any map. This game is a barren wasteland of nothingness. Literally a total waste of time.Next, this game is loaded with microtransactions. Now I get it, dev's have a right to earn funds from their product, I agree with the idea but they're doing it horribly wrong. For starters, this game offers NOTHING different, unique, or new in comparison to other PvP competitors. Sure, you can argue the basis of content that your fighting on dragon back but, there needs to actually ""be"" another player to fight. There is no one most of the time. So that argument is not only invalid but impractical. The prices for their products are incredibly high and there is no incentive to even contribute to this community of developers. Every single action has been a step on the wrong foot in the wrong direction by the dev's and this path may not be capable of recovering from.Lastly, the final nail in the coffin of this review. You see, this is solely a PvP game. When a PvP game doesn't work, people will go to the thousands of other options out there. If a solely PvP game is gonna last, it needs to be good from the start or have some super stubborn Dev's who are willing to take a net loss early on. So, lets compare this game to another highly celebrated PvP game:* Team Fortress 2 for the longest time was a pretty much just a PvP based game before the release of Man vs Machine. the game offered loads of different maps and combat strategies with a range of diversity FROM THE START. All characters and maps were unlocked from the very beginning.By locking out all of the dragons and map types for a game and group of developers that have NO reputation what so ever the developers have completely locked out any possible redeming features. I'd try to get my profile to level 3 to try out other maps, but no one plays. If I can't play against anyone, I can't level. So definitely no redemption here.As I said, neat concept and there are a load of opportunities with this idea, but at the end of the day this product was so buggy and incomplete with sooooo little content it's turned out to be a total waste of effort and time. I see there are a lot of people who wrote positive reviews, but when you take the time to read the reviews there is nothing sufficient stating why the game is good. People by nature like to positively rate something if has an idea they like associate with the material. In this case, dragons, flying, pvp, laser guns. All popular topics fused into one unique, though incomplete concept. Thing is though, pretty much the majority of all of these positive reviews have less than an hour of play and I doubt most people take time to spend initial gameplay to analyze and study the game before dedicating time to playing.What this says is the idea has merit, people ""want"" something like this, but Dev's, you gotta fix your micro transations and a LOT more content and fast.Best of luck, over and out.--------------------------------------------------Previous Bugs in Forementioned Post:* Players would get permanently stuck in blue phantom form during rez or spawning of character.* When timer for mission runs out ""with"" players the mission timer gets stuck at 00:01 and never ends, forcing you to abort manually and loose all progress.* When timer for missin runs out ""without"" players and you actually wait for timer to run out, you get a draw being the only player who stuck out all 7 minutes. No reward for dedication.* When you get reward crates, you ONLY get one skin, and it's the same one every time. Forgot the name, but it's the blue one for starter dragon. I opened 7 crates, same thing every time no matter what container I picked.			"

												Even though this game is in Russian for the most part, it is mostly self explanatory once you look at the controls. The tooltips are legible enough. For a brand new f2p game (truly f2p nothing to spend money on) it is quite playable, especially for a small dev team. I have not found any glitches, controls work well even on mouse and keyboard, graphics are average, and quick matchmaking (on release day), a great game for when you are bored! People who are writing negative reviews apparently do not want to take any time to learn a game without a tutorial, and are judging it as if it were a ""AAA"" game with hundreds of people working on it and plentiful money to do so.

However, there is a small issue with the animation framerate which makes the game feel much less fluid than it should (animations are running at 30fps but game engine is capped at 60fps) But, this is a minor issue and can be related to either the netcode or the physics implimentation.It is a small game with limited weaponry, but that makes balanicng much easier (take BF4's 100+ weapons that all need to be balanced and there are still multiple carbines in that game with are absurdly OP) And focuses on skill-based combat, rather than who has the higher damage output.

												Desperately needs a tutorial to teach players what they can and can not do. For instance changing equipment/weapons isn't intuitive and unless you accidently click on it or someone tells you, you will never know that you even can change it.The amount of players that I have seen just flying around trying to figure out the controls is kind of depressing, especially when you realize that those players are like level 6+ meaning they have played for at the least a few rounds.The game functions but honestly that is about it. Its kind of odd that a dragon can't land on solid ground, and instead takes damage... Would also appreciate some way to tell how many people are playing in which game types. As is you have to load into every game type to find which ones people are playing (that is just because there aren't a lot of players, nothing the dev can do).If you like dogfighting games then this could be entertaining to you, otherwise not so much.

												After Some extensive playing I've come to a conclusion, this game isn't very good at its current state, but if the developers put time and effort it could have some promise.The game itself is a very good concept, very similar to other plane fighting games, but with the added bonus of dragons and their abilities.The game has some major cons-Limited leveling system: Nothing more than unlocking 1 DNA per level to unlock more dragons.-Terrible collision, some things hurt you, while others you can pass right through, or pass through and get stuck partially inside.-No team building, all matches are random and you cant join friends without continuously joining matches and leaving until you're all in the same lobby-There is literally no backstory to the game, nor is there any spaceship fighting, like the video suggests.-There is also no First person flying, like the video also suggestsOverall, at the games current state i cannot recommend it, but eventually it may be a decent game.

												Time of Dragons delivers an interesting take on aerial combat. It's free, looks good and offers the ability to jump in and play with minimal time investment. I'd like to see where development takes the game, but right now it's a solid starting point.			"

												For a game that has both ""free"" and ""dragons"" in the same store page, this is a surprisingly good find.There are a handful of dragons to unlock, you can play as a dragon, it does not take very long to level up and earn more DNA to unlock new dragons, you can play as a dragon, the dragons have lasers and missiles and unique attributes/special abilities, you can play as a dragon, the flight mechanics are easy to get the hang of, you can play as a dragon, the dragon models are well-made and the graphics are good even on ""medium,"" you can play as a dragon...And, the devs seem to be active with updating this game with new content and features.My only gripe is that not too many people seem to actively play this game at the moment, as I hopped between most of the game modes and kept running into the same players (and the servers were mostly empty on top of that, minus the one for the ""free-for-all"" mode). Hopefully, as this game grows, the number of players does, too, because for a 100% free game about fighting with dragons, this is a gem.			"

												It's quite good. Though, it lacks a few things, and can be burnt up quite quickly. There's not too much in terms of weapon choices and dragons nor customization, looking at the same few dragons for so long kills the mood pretty quick. Honestly i do look forward to seeing this get big, but there's allot of work ahead of the devs before this gets overly big. I do recomend it, and while it's missing some stuff and needs some work, it connects to matches quickly and it's good for a quick match to kill time while waiting for a friend or partner to get ready to go out or go to school or whatever. And honestly it's completely free, no microtransactions at all to be seen. So give it a go, but don't expect it to be the quality of bigger companies, it's a free game, not Black Ops 3. It'll get better though and playing with friends will make it more fun, it's definitely worth the two gigabites it took up on my laptop. I hope the devs make this go allot further, though just an opinion of a player, it'd be nice to customise the dragons and weapons a bit more. Even if it's just the colours.			"

												This game is ridiculously fun. I mean, dragons shooting lasers and missiles!? Where did the developers think of that!? What were they smoking!? No matter, the gameplay is ridiculously fun once you figure out how to move, shoot and not get blown to pieces in 2 seconds flat. I mean... dragons... with lasers... and missiles. TIny download, easy to pick up, all for the price of free. What's there to gripe about? Go fly some dragons!I made a little gameplay video of a recent FFA session, which was 100% pure unadulterated raw penguin mayhem. I mean, dragon mayhem.

												Since I now have a lot of hours into the game. Going to put more detail into the review on the game. :)From watching the game evolve over time, it is getting better.In DM, gotta love the battle royal when it is going right and you don't have people sitten and talking. TDM is really good as it is based on two actual opposing sides. Think of Braveheart if ya will with that. Soul Collector and Souls are all good but both modes are normally dead with no one in them. Control Point has people in it off and on but is also one of the fun ones as speed does count in Control point.For those starting out, best advice I can give is to go through the tutorial. Once you get the idea of the basics, you can start taking steps further in the DM, Control Point (lvl 15+) and TDM matches that go on. This is one of those games where you really have to practice to get use to the 3D motions and adjust to the mechanics. There is no real way around it unless you have played other 3D flying similators. Rage quitting never helps in the gameplay or getting use to the mechanics. When you run into the higher levels, the level really doesn't mean anything other then gameplay time and how many matches that person has been in. Don't be afraid of being in a match with a higher level. You do get better at the game over time. I won't deny it. Before reaching the status I am at now in game, I had a rough ride in the beginning worse then most starting out now. There was no tutorial and the game only had TDM and DM. I had to learn on the fly and my k/d was actually only a 0.03 from the time I was a lvl 1 to a lvl 8. I had help from players that are sadly no longer around and did pay it forward in helping other new players learn up until the tutorial was released. In short, yes the beginning levels are tough but the more you practice and get the hang of the mechanics, the better you do get in game.Certain dragons do well with specific builds. That I will admit to in this game. Wrong or bad building mechanic does make a kill per death worse for a player pending on the dragon. When you start getting use to the game, you fall into one of five nitches in game. Aggressor, Support, Marksman, Tansverse or Ambusher are the main nitches in game. The dragon used the most is what helps place a player into that specific nitch when in game.The maps right now are very detailed but don't trying swimming as you'll drown the poor dragon. Sadly dragons cannot swim in this game or the water is an acid. Not sure which it is though.Pros: Great multiplayer, different dragon and non dragon type of creatures, very well balanced between the dragon types, Huge maps, A nice mix of both day and night, Nicely detailed with the mapsCons: Still buggy, a few players still ""teleport"" (lag in and out) somehow across the map making it difficult to shoot at them. There are a few other minor bugs but not serious enough to be an overall issue at times.			"

Posted: June 19, 2016
Summary:I've been playing this game for awhile and I personally enjoy it. Most of the bugs are UI/lobby related and the core game-play works well enough for a free game. Sure, the recent update added micro-transactions, but it's VERY far from a pay to win game. After having it be 100% free for awhile, I didn't mind pitching in $8 for a new dragon to support the devs.My advice: Play this game with minimum expectations and just play it for awhile. Sure you'll die a lot at first, but it becomes enjoyable once you eventually learn how to move and shoot. Overall I give this a 6.5/10. It's a fun game, just that the bugs need to be worked out before I'd give it an 8-9/10.Pros:- Dragons with FRICKIN' LAZURRS strapped to their back!- Decently balanced game-play. Each dragon class is the same for everyone, each weapon type damage the same as everyone. Doesn't matter what level you are. If you screw up, you die just as easily as everyone else. Although that's not to say there isn't room for improvement.- ""Paid dragons"" are obtainable with normal game-play, and don't give an large, unfair, advantage. I bought one of the dragons and it's stats barely differ from it's default counterpart. Mostly cosmetic changes with a new ability, but still relies mainly on player skill. Advantage is marginal at best.- Game-play is quick, fun, and straight-forward for the most part. This is the kind of game you play if you want a break and want to shoot down some dragons.Neutral:- Graphics are okay, but sub-par. Sound design is rather simple. There's definitely room for improvement.- Learning curve ranges from moderate to hard. This is in-part due to being in the same room as experienced players. You will die a lot before you get a feel for how to move and shoot in this game. Then again, that's the same for most games.Cons:- Bugs. Bugs everywhere. Ranges from spawning outside the insta-death fence, to crashing when trying to load certain maps, to errors when unlocking dragons. The UI feels really clunky. Features like room/lobby info are missing, there's no chat history, and dragon selection in-game sometimes glitches. Just to name a few.- No option to chose a room. Can't even know how many people are in a specific game mode without entering it to check. It's just ""choose a game mode and hope for the best.""- No team auto-balance. It just places people in each team in order of when they first joined the room. This sometimes leads to all the high-level players being on one team, and low-levels on the other.- Not a whole bunch of people play. Depending on what time you're on, all the game modes can be empty. Granted, people do still play and there are occasionally have full rooms.			"

												It's pretty much a lot like fighter planes where you have a stroke every 15 seconds.Free for all is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke, you spawn in the center of the map, sometimes in other dragons. Before you can even move, you'll be hit by three explosive abilities as Tiamats do circles around spawn for kills.Team play is a little less of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mess as you don't spawn in the middle of combat/dragons/gunfire. A lack of objectives to fight over really brings the dragon fighting into full focus where honestly, it has very little business being.Dragon combat is basically four seconds of shooting, followed by three seconds of cool down. Even if you avoid overheating the gun, the shield adds heat and blocks at random. The overheating mechanic would be fine if you can kill an enemy dragon in a volley or two or had other things to do aside from hit your ultimate ability once every fifteen seconds, but as it stands, general play goes like this:Find enemy dragonFire a volleyOverheatFire a volleyOverheatUse the shieldOverheatDrink vodkaOverheatFire a volleyOverheatUse abilityEnemy dies due to being more filled with vodka than youRepeatUnfortunately without objectives the only way you can lose teamfighting is by straying into enemy gunfire while they alternate three dragons in a clump shielding and firing. Since collision isn't a thing you can cluster♥♥♥♥ a three-headed game breaking hydra the second you find someone who speaks english.Also let's talk about collision for a minute. My tail touched the very edge of a lake and I instantly threw my guns down and died. I hit a rock with a wing and sometimes I get stuck only to be dislodged like the sword in the stone 6000 years later, or my wing phases through entirely unmolested.This is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke and I can't recommend it for anyone, it's not even worth streaming it's so dreadfully unoptimized and boring. Usually games like this can be hilariously bad but it's not even worth that.			"

												As a new user this game is sort of a dream come true :)  I really hope you guys expand on this topic, add more dragons (moar epic music too!).  Do this, stay good spirited and indieish, I will definitely be back to help support you.Only cons I have to players reading this:-controls are a bit clunky, but it's meant to reflect the dragon type you are using-limited dragons, but this IS early access updated, much more satisfactory-Low player amounts, hoping as this game updates there will be more of a followingI would really like to see more people playing this game this is your main problem right now.Graphics will be updated as you guys improve, I get that.Great start, early access and all.

												I spent a few minutes reading the description for the dragons,then picked the vampire. One mintue later I was dodging lazers and rockets which would have took me out if I didnt duck into the temple. I flew out the other side and bombarded my enemies with plasma shots for the win. Its not too technical,doesn`t have the highest graphics but it will give you some hours of fun. No money store so its not pay to win and its easy to pick up. Cant go wrong with the price either.			"

Its an unpolished gem, maybe in need of more weaponry options and a more streamlined way of unlocking skins, but the gameplay is solid and the balance is fair.

												I've read a lot of the reviews on this game and there don't seem to be very many ""proper"" reviews (at least, not recently.)I've been playing this game a fair bit and must say that it is definitely worth putting a little bit of time into if you like games about dragons and more PvP rather than PvE/storymode games.--------Pros:--------Just to point out, I really like dragons.1. You get to fight AS the dragon, not against the dragon.2. Lasers (self-explanatory)3. If you enjoy a lot of PvP, this is a good game to choose.4. There are quite a variety of PvP modes to choose from, despite them being either higher level, or not available yet.--------Cons:--------1. Graphics are, admittedly, not the best they could probably be. (Graphics shown in the trailer would be ideal)2. There aren't very many players online. (That doesn't really have anything to do with the game itself, though.) I would recommend more advertising or something like that.3. There are a few spelling/grammar mistakes that should definitely be fixed (one is located in the Tiamat info box. The word ""instant"" is spelled wrong. (As of 9-29-16))4. Combat system seems a bit too tedious. There should be more freedom (especially in the amount of ""ammo"" that you get.5. Leveling and matchmaking seems to be quite uneven and should be fixed somehow. (Match more equal levels and separate the teams correctly. No 1v4 matches or mess ups like that.)--------------Conclusion--------------I do understand that this game IS still pretty early in development. However, I would really like to see the quality come up from where it is now, to where it is in the trailer. That would be absolutely ideal for me.I wouldn't mind some kind of story mode if that is to ever become a thing in this game. I feel that it would add to the background and give the game a bit more sense, while still being able to easily participate in PvP. (I much rather prefer PvE over PvP)The different PvP modes being restricted kind of bugs me because it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense, especially with there being a lack of players available to play the game properly. Different dragons and abilities would be another great addition to the game, to get rid of some of the monotony that you eventually experience after playing too long.All in all, I would say that it is good for the stage it is at in development, minus a few things. I would recommend it to anyone who actually wants to play AS the dragon, rather than always fighting it. Although, I don't think it's quite ready to be a full-on game.			"

The weapon cool down helps so much with spamming. I don't think people realize the devs are so limited with their game being free to play. If they add a store, some dragon skins and maybe a special dragon, and improve their game I'm sure they'll get more people to play.			"

												After reading the reviews for this game, I'd say about 40% of them are mature and helpful. SO. Let's begin shall we? First off, let me get this off of my sholders, this is baisicallt a rip off of How to Train You Dragon, with lasers. Guns. Missles. Lasers. Guns. More guns. A bit repetative ey?Secondly, this game is very addicting. Unlike other videogame, this one doesen't make you pay for crap. True, it has DLCs that cost 24$ but, then again, the DLC packs are huge. They cover about 60% of the whole game's items and skins!Thirdly, the community is very helpful and kind. Rather small though. This game has taught me to do well with teamwork, communication, and taught me that dragon physics don't always work the way you EXPECT it to work. (Damn turning radius)The loot crates spawn for you A LOT. More than other games. That is another reason why this game is worth it. Unlike Primal Carnage: Extinction, I get a silver loot crate in two game. And I don't have to pay ANYTHING!!! No keys. No money. No nothing. You're just AWARDED with the crates, and you OPEN them. Not with your hand though. You don't have hands in the game...Or do you?Overall: TOTALLY WORTH IT. How to Train Your Dragon rip off, with GUNZ GUNZ LAZERZ! Friendly community! Unlike... *AHEM*  Five Nights at Freddy's community and the 9 year old Undertale ♥♥♥♥♥♥s (Like me. Even though Im not 9 years old... Obviously)  ANYWAY!!!! Talking about DRAGONS... Not killer teddy bears... Addicting game, friendly community, lasers dragonz guns missles...Guns...More guns...			"

												BEST GAME EVER MADE. BEST PHYSICS. BEST GUNS. BEST GAMEPLAY. BEST STORYLINE.Time of Dragons is a gem for tactical 3D shooters fans, especially those who love air combat. The developers did a great job developing maps with using caves, gorges, valleys and such – that is, elements that can be used tactically during a battle. The game has excellent graphics, so even riding a dragon is immensely exciting thanks to outstanding creature animation. Its this game does to video games what morgan freeman did to voice acting and being black.			"

												This is a free, areal combat game.The military has given dragons, stingrays and other creatures lasers and other kinds of weapons to send versus other armed flying creatures.There game runs smoothly and the consept is good.The maps are too small, all the dragons have such a low turn rate, some of the creatures aren't even dragons and your none tradeable or marketable ingame items is in your steam inventory where you can never get rid of it.There are acheivements.If you like slow areal combat with ultimate abilitys and spesial shots, bombs, small maps, you can not land, there is singleplayer part apart from practice, no story mode, not all dragons are unlocked from the start, too few players to have fun and spawn camping the enemys or your guys is something for you then this might fit for you.Have fun, enjoy and pew pew roar :)			"

												I only just started playing this game (and played for 3 hours straight on that single run), but I like how the battles are designed. Some things that slightly tick me off though:1) Ability to drop a million mines at the start of the match, blowing up the poor player who spawns in the same location as you (maybe put a delay on using items at the beginning of the match or add 5 second spawn immunity)2) Only thing with leveling is gaining DNA to unlock the other dragons (there's nothing else to 'buy' or 'upgrade'; maybe add a shop with customization designs)3) Only FFA and team DM, maybe add more game modes like Co-op missions in taking out ships (like in the trailer) (plus you can't really join in the same game with friends; maybe add a lobby system?)4) No information on what each dragon's special ability does; I had to play them in order to figure it out (put it in the info box for each dragon on the main page)5) Spawn camping in FFA (aka dropping 3-8 mines in spots where players spawn or sniping them as they spawn; maybe add a 5 second spawn immunity)Things I like about the game:1) Dragons (ofc) :32) Different classes of dragons with different strategies of playing them3) The overheat system, aka the battle system (this actually makes you strategize your attacks)4) Easy to get into and learn (remember to hit F1 when you're somewhere safe to actually read what keys do what)5) You can switch between third person and 'first person' by scrolling with mouse wheel (first person is similar to that shown in trailer; other reviews saying there's no first person just didn't know how to scroll imo)I like the game so far, and I hope that the devs take note of suggestions posted in these reviews :PPS: Apparently the meta for the game already is dropping mines all over the place; then dropping more mines; and more; and lure enemies into more mines >_> (mines jfc plz nerf rly XD jk don't nerf it's valid strategy just annoying :P ) "

												All in all a good Aerial Combat game.This originally showed up in my discovery queue, and after reading the page i immediately downloaded it to try.GAME MECHANICS & COMBAT:This is an Aerial Combat game set up a little like COD with Deathmatch/TeamDeathmatch and other objective based sessions. You can play as 8 different starting dragons as well as several hybrid forms unlocked later.In these sessions you shoot from your dragons back with energy guns of sorts.However, the issue i found with the guns are the shot sights.they turn when your dragon does with some delays depending on the speed of your chosen dragon, which is fine, but even the fast dragons take really long to re-center their sights.... The really high mobility and speed dragons even have this issue, meaning close quarters combat can get very hard...MAPS:This brings me to the maps. There are not many maps, all of them have lots of diversity, even with day/night variants for some. Though, many of the maps are not very big for a flight game, excluding say the ""Islands"" map.This is where the dragon sights re-center time is an issue, since the maps are small you will be turning alot, meaning a lot of time you can't really attack...More maps would be cool, as well as bigger ones since fighting in the same few over and over can get tiresome...MATCHES VS SYSTEM:The match system is interesting. However there is no balancer to the teams, meaning that you could be put into a session that currently has 1V5 players.Also there is a way to link up with your friends to do matches together, like parties or groups, which is a nice addition.MODES:As of now there is only the battle modes, being: Deathmatch/TeamDeathmatch & a sort of capture the flag session style where the ""flags"" are your enemy team's ""souls"".Since this is an Aerial combat game it would be cool if they added a freeroam mode, where you could chose a map to fly in and just explore, or play with your friends in.A freeroam would also be nice since there ARE such few modes to chose from.Of course if a freeroam mode was added, there would need to be activities to do. Maybe add races for players to fly through, or hidden object challenges?This could add more variety to the game and attract more players.LEVEL & MATCHING:Now, this game is an MMO. This also means there is a levels system.You get EXP from matches which go to your level.However, it seems the only reason for your level is to lock some modes until a higher level or to show other players your experience level in the game. It doesn't even do anything for the matching system, since in some cases I myself have been placed on a team of 3 level 3-8's VS 5 level 38-62's....This would be better if it had more use, but it is there...BUGS & LAG:The game doesn't have many lag issues, usually loading quite fast.I have incountered a bug in the last little while where the daily crates have first started giving 1 with each login regardless of the day and then stopped appearing all together..The bug i mentioned previously in this review however has been fixed.All that aside, as a player i would probably give this game a 7/10 in its current state.

												Pretty simple (so far) but incredibly fun arial shooter. But this game is addictive, the dragons are really cool and the abilities are fun. The Flying takes a bit of getting used to at first but becomes really fun, It could benefit from a tutorial or something. But man, I could sink hours into this game. Cosmetic dragon skins like what MOBA games like League do would be really cool. I could easliy see myself paying for those. But cosmetic stuff only, not abilites or weapons. >>Edit<<They've since inproved the UI with better information and added a Play with friends button! THat makes me super happy, every update just serves to make the game better and more user friendly, I think. I never expected to like this game as much as I did when I downloaded it on a whim just to see if it was any good. <3			"

The gameplay is super fun but the lack of content is pretty bad. There aren't any achievements, all the dragons are easy to get, there is no ranking system, and there are not that many players. I guess I would recommend if you just want to have fun for an hour or so but don't expect anything more than that.			"

												It's a good game for those who want a cash grabber dog fighter and hardly any replayability. You start out with one dragon, play as him until you get your second, then you play as him because the first got boring, and now you have a third, and you play as that because the second got boring, and the process continues. You can purchase crates for money, and those crates give you skins that you can use on specific dragons, and there isn't really any noticable option to change your weapons, you can only change your dragon(I may be mistaken.)

Dragons! Lasers!...interested yet?Time of Dragons is a bizarre game, and I like that. You basically fly your dragon around and do your best to murder other dragons in the face with lasers and fire/poison/electricity, depending on the dragon. The team has done a great job coming up with different types of dragons (including - for some reason - a manta ray). They also offer a couple of pretty good environments to do battle in.This game has some problems. Free-for-all mode has all dragons spawn in the same spot, resulting in massive amounts of death for those who want to farm their points and nip unsuspecting players. The firing system requires massive recharge times, which detracts somewhat from gameplay. ""Leveling up"" or choosing more advanced dragons gives you very little tactical benefit, though I suppose that's not bad for newbs like me.At the end of the day, though, these problems don't detract enough for me to dislike this game. Time of Dragons is just plain and simple fun.[Edit 1: The first problem with the game has been solved! The second still exists though.]			"

												This game has a lot of potential, but currently the game gets boring quite fast, due to there not being much of a incentive to play except to get level-ups, which isn't much. This game would be much better if it had a way to play with your friends, because when I tried to do that I would have to leave and join games over, over, and over until about 5-10 minutes later I finally got into the same game my friend was in. This game is a good time-waster though, so if you want to waste some time, get this game. :)(I am recommending this game because it has issues, but no game is perfect. Soon enough, this game can become a very popular game, it just needs some work.)			"

												I'm only giving this game a good rating because I still enjoy it even though it's poorly designed in some aspects, such as:Matches: It's really annoying when you join a game and there's six opponents and only one other teammate. This game has no type of balancing.Languages: Prepare to get killed by your teammates who happens to be friends with some person from the other team who speaks a different language. Games aren't fun at all when you can't understand anyone.Glitches: I find that the game crashes often, every few matches. In game, there are glitches where you can hide in towers on a certain map to avoid being shot. Sometimes you spawn outside of the map and are forced to kill yourself.Lobbies: You are unable to pick a lobby to join, instead you have to randomly join and hope for the best, and you have to repeat this process until you're placed in room.Like I said, while this game has its rough spots it is a good game overall. It's fun and addicting, and after all it only came out reccently. If these things get fixed I'll change my review. Hope you found this helpful.EDIT: Almost has as many angry russians as Dota.			"

												An interesting idea, these guys had. Dragons wielding laser-guns. Quick paced, action focused, and all around a good game. I just wish I could land my dragon and set up an ambush, or have some cloaking/invisibility mechanic that maybe prevents you from shooting. Also, the shield is not very useful. It doesn't block as much damage as I think it should, and over-heats too quikly. I have not seen many people use it, simply becuase it does not work. This game has a lot of potential, and I would love to see it grow.			"

												For a free, early access game this is looking pretty good so far. I enjoy flying around and defeating other dragons with the use of missiles and plasma cannons. I even went through a phase of playing this game often and in doing so, I noticed I was playing with the same players over and over. Even the leaderboards contain mostly players I have seen and played with before. After playing against some of the same people a few times, it can actually feel like two players have something against each other and begin trying to kill each other more than the other players. As with many games, you can hurt players on your team which can lead to you being betrayed (this normally only happens when there are no enemies and your team seems to get bored easily) or accidentally hit. Of course this problem lies within player attitude and not the game itself. I can say though, that the lack of enemies (or teammates for that matter) seems to be down to the game seemingly having no team balancing which results in a lot of unfair matches.The flight feels quite nice and fluid for the most part but it can be hard to determine the scale and distance of certain objects in the environment. So when you are flying around and you notice you're coming quite close to something large, you usually try to turn sharply or pull up which is difficult sometimes as the dragon seems to want to almost drift and keep moving forward as opposed to just sharply and swiftly pulling up. Most of the time you end up crashing into said object which makes you more vulnerable to attack. The turret/weapon system is great. It features a number of weapons and items to help you in battle such as plasma turrets (default weapon/fire type), missiles and a special attack that is performed with the R key if I can remember correctly. Most of the special attacks are short range and have what seems to be a spherical radius. In my opinion, the Ogre's (big green, tank-like dragon) special attack is overpowered, since he can stun you and keep you in one spot then use his vast amount of health and firepower to quickly dispose of you.Anyway, my next point about the turret and weapons system is that the crosshair seems to take a very long time to catch up with where your dragon is looking which can be annoying when you have a clear shot ready but your crosshair is nowhere to be seen. Earlier I mentioned items. These items include stamina refill, weapon cooldown, mines (that float in the air) and a smoke screen (I may have missed something from the list). These also have a cooldown period but can give you an edge in battle and instantly regenerate upon respawning after death. The mines and smoke screen can be good items to use and can make a great combo as you can drop a mine if you're being followed, then drop the smoke screen which will blind your enemy and lead them to fly into the mine. The smoke screen can also hide you when you're on low health and allow you to escape. Your dragon can be given a speed boost (shift key) which takes stamina rather quickly but (if you have it equipped) you can use your stamina refill to give your dragon a second boost.I did notice that the models and sounds seem to be based off other games/movies... The Inara - Ikran (Avatar) (Similar sounds too)The Fury - Toothless (HTTYD/2) (Also similar sounds)The Vampire (mainly it's head) reminds me of creatures from the old game Altered Beast but may just be a coincidence.Tiamat is given the same name as the bat queen from Darksiders (perhaps this dragon was given this name instead of the vampire since it would have looked too close to Tiamat). Again, perhaps it's just coincidence or I'm just looking into it too much.This game is very team based with nice graphics and a great idea behind it. It's a great game for passing the time and having fun and can actually be quite competitive. When you have balanced teams, it can be very enjoyable. If you enjoy team based, dragon flying, weapon firing action then this game is for you. I recommend trying this game and seeing what you think. I may have written a bunch of bad points (which I seem to find it hard not to with most things) but I do really like this game.I apologise for this painfully long (not as painful as my overuse of certain words) review but thank you for reading - if you didn't die of old age before getting to the end... This is my first review.			"

												For the most part, this game looks promising. I really like the concept of being able to control dragons that have lazers beam and missiles and fighting them to the death. Of course, there isn't guite as much to do as it stands, and it was running a little laggy for me (but then again, I'm using my laptop), however with time and good effort, I think this can become an excellent game. So my recomendations: try it out. It never hurts to try a free game.			"

												     This game...meh. I didn't really get into it. Not my style, you could say, but all things considered, I really just didn't like it. It might appeal to some, but I found the game to be fairly boring in nearly all areas. The dragons didn't seem very interesting or original, at least in my eyes, and were sometimes hard to control in the game itself. I found myelf getting shot from behind  quite a lot, dying before I even knew what was happening. This could easily be attributed to my lack of skill in the game, but, ah, well, I really just found it hard not to get shot in the back.      One of the good points, I must add, is that the stats actually make a difference. I mean, some games get me confused as to why I need to up my stealth, or my stamina, or whatever else they can think up., but here it can be very clear as to the weaknesses and strengths of each dragon. That was nice, of course, but everything else sort of faded into the background. The art? I can barely remember it. The music? Was there any music at all in this game?     So, yeah, average game. Could just be my opinion, but I didn't like it. Play it if you want, but don't expect me to recommend it.			"

There's no story at all.There's Team Deathmatch and Free For All.No waiting lines,  you go right away into a match.The game is still been updated and developed, not gonna lie about that, it kinda really feels like an early access game, but it's still a pretty fun game to waste time playing soaring through the skies and killing other dragons with explosions and lasers.Here hoping it doesn't die before more content can be put into it.

												Although it could be hard to control the dragons and aim at first, this is a great game if you like to challenge others through your skills, not upgrades. While there are some who like to use cheats and upgrade their dragons by buying them, they are only a few of the many. I do recomend this game to those who like to play jet fighter games, but if you prefer something else, it is very likely that you would not like this so much, but you are still welcome to try.(Suggestion to the maker= I think it would be good to have a daily gift instead of only level up gift, because it is really hard to get prizes. Also, it would be great if you could make more weapons and more dragons. Thank you for the work you have done to make the game!! ^^)			"

												Although it could be hard to control the dragons and aim at first, this is a great game if you like to challenge others through your skills, not upgrades. While there are some who like to use cheats and upgrade their dragons by buying them, they are only a few of the many. I do recomend this game to those who like to play jet fighter games, but if you prefer something else, it is very likely that you would not like this so much, but you are still welcome to try.(Suggestion to the maker= I think it would be good to have a daily gift instead of only level up gift, because it is really hard to get prizes. Also, it would be great if you could make more weapons and more dragons. Thank you for the work you have done to make the game!! ^^)			"

												A brilliant game that combines two of my favourite things: dragons and shooting-games. The only bad thing I'd say is that earlier it was a free to play and free to win, now it's becoming free to play, pay to win. A great game anyway.			"

												Its a god game that needs ALOT of work. cool idea, i like the controls, and it doesnt seem to lag to much on an old PC. It needs a tutorial though. This game also needs more content, and when i say content, i mean story line, purpose, skill systems, and maybe some more controls (pitch, yaw and what not) not more dragons.			"

												Despite some early bugs (That were promptly fixed. A+) and not the best graphics, this game was amazingly fun. It actually felt as if you were an epic dragon fighting in an arena. The combat was fun and diverse, you have many different options for how to go about a fight. The mechanics are diverse enough to let you play how you want. I found I could rack up a lot of kills as an artillery dragon who sits in the back, or a speedy fast dragon that gets up in their faces and makes them have to out-manevour me. (Which ends up being fatal for them because I seem to have perfected stopping and reseting your aim.)Now the cons... The GUI isn't great at all. It's hard to tell what any of the ultimates do or what the specific guns do. (Though some experiments will reveal them pretty quickly, and you can change something in the middle of a round if you don't like it.) As well as the stastics are really confusing and doesn't really tell me anything meaningful. (The ""heat"" stat was really confusing. [Heat being a mechanic that limits how often you can shoot. Different weapons build up different amounts of heat, you build up too much heat you overheat and can't shoot, but you can let it cool down a little bit before you shoot again so that you don't overheat.] Because the lower the stat is apparently the more heat you can take?)7/10 (Fun, but could be a lot better.)But I really enjoyed it. Getting past some of the weird UI and willing to expirement to find out what does what, it's really really fun. If they improved GUI and their stastics this would be 1 point higher. If the graphics were better (Though they aren't terrible.) I would give them another point. :)			"

												Alright, well, I haven't played much yet as you can see, but I have played enough to see just about everything the game has to offer. (There isn't too much content right now, but I let that slide seeing as how it's clear this game is still in its infancy) PROS:~ Dragons with lazer beams on their backs!~ Fun and easy to understand gameplay, no real tutorial is needed unless you have a hard time understanding very simple game mechanics. ~ This game has a CRAPLOAD of potential, and I hope to see that potential realized as they update the game.CONS:(Note: These cons are about the game in it's condition at the time of the review, cons are subject to change in future updates)~ You cannot select specific maps or servers that you would like to play on, you select a game mode and it puts you in a random match, so you only have a ""Quick Match"" option essentially.~ No party system, this makes playing with friends nearly impossible, your friends also cannot join your match via the Steam Overlay~ All of the Dragons have different stats and abilities but feel exactly the same in the end. What about adding a dragon that can stabilize itself on the ground and do mortar fire at the cost of mobility. Or a dragon that can ""Snipe"" with a zoom in ability. Until things like this are implimented, all of the dragons feel exactly the same. ~ DNA is useless for the time being. Essentially you earn ""DNA"" points as you rank up, but all you do with it is unlock dragons... which there aren't very many of at the moment. I imagine in the future it will be used to unlock weapons, upgrade dragon specific abilities and such. But for now its next to useless.In the end I can say this, as long as the devs continue to make improvements, and don't RUIN the game with said improvements, I will recommend this game and would spend money on it.NOTE FOR THE DEVELOPERS: Should you guys decide to implement a Microtransaction system for the game... there is only ONE way to do it without making players angry or making your game Pay to Win. The purchasable content can ONLY be cosmetic items... ONLY cosmetic items... such as dragon skins, weapon skins, etc. Customizable items will still make you money without making the game Pay to Win and thus losing and angering your player base.			"

												This could be great, i can see it becoming much more than it is now and being pretty popular, it's not there yet by any means but it could be. Obviously i've not had a chance to explore all the modes or dragons but it has promise. Will say that it should probably have a grief system or no friendly fire in place though as one person in a match liked to TK people and the only way to police that is to TK them back before they get you (which is annoying).

												It works, and gameplay isn't too bad. The game's a bit sloppy, but is fun. But unlocking things doesn't take a lot of effort because the game still needs more content and a bigger player base. Also, why is there inventory integration if none of the items are markettable or tradeable??  Not sure I'd spend more than $10 on it in the current state.			"

TL;DR: Time of Dragons is, overall, a good game for free. Suffers from a lack of players.Pros:+ free game without microtransactions+ dragons with freakin' laser beams+ little bugs/issues that I've come across (addressed in cons section)+ decent Halo-esque 3D textures for a small indie game+ games don't snowball (unless your ""team"" leaves you)+ small game+ high framerateNeutrals:/ little player count; I've typically only ever seen one lobby./ achievements (I love me some achivements)/ OS X support (although not many people game on macs, it works very well on my rMBP)Cons:- Kill assist system a little weird/buggy; I'll whittle a player down and someone else will sweep in for the KS (which isn't so much the game's fault as thhe player's) but then I don't receive credit half of the time.- Not a whole lot to do due to low player count- Cannot pass tutorial level due to not being able to shoot when prompted despite repeatedly clicking the left mouse button. Works well otherwise.Points of interest:{ Controls take a bit of getting used to, but fun and easy to handle when you get the hang of it. Took me a bit to get turning down.{ Higher level players get only a bigger number next to their name and access to having more, but not particularly better, dragons, giving more to players with more skill rather than a higher level.{ Right now, it's best playing with a friend so at the very least just to have someone to play against. (Can be seen as a pro if you like private lobbies, or as a con because you can't lobby hop if you don't particularly like the players in a certain game.)Overall an entertaining game for free. Would recommend if you want to kill a few hours. Needs more players to play with/against, which you can help with by getting the game!8/10~Pie(Edit: Formatting + TL;DR) "

												The game is great in certain aspects. The flying is fun and it is just a blast to glide about as a dragon, zooming through the environment.the combat feels good and challenging, a real accomplishment when you finally get the hang of it.the one problem I have with the game is the community. I have nothing against the Russian players like other people in the review section do but because of the language barrier, it's hard to communicate as a team. Plus some of the players are just really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, deciding to shoot you down, a member of their team, during a team deathmatch (or whatever its called in this game, sorry I can't remember) just because they are bored or they think it's funny.all in all, a great game that with work, has serious potential.I'd probably rate this game 8/10			"

												Well... it works I guess?In all seriousness the gameplay isn't awful and the controls, although not explained, could be worse.The audio sounds like a trumpet was thrown in a blender and then toasted, who's idea was it to compress the sounds that much anyway?The community is a smaller version of CS:GO's community, so if you're used to dealing with them you'll fit right in.The progression system is, to say anything, nonexistant. Levels appear to give you nothing at all and the small handful of total playable dragons can be unlocked in a day.There s no tutorial or explaination of things, you're just thrown right in with a dragon you know nothing about and are expected to know everything, although a rumour did show up at some point that the developer is working on one.I'd give it a 5/10, if you don't care for quality and just wanna play some video games, this one'll do.

												Fun game, especially for the price. There's a few irritating bugs (such as one in the tutorial that makes it so you can't shoot and thus can never pass it), but it's a great way to kill some time with friends. However, for a multiplayer game, it needs more people to actually play it. It's way to easy to farm, because sometimes you enter a lobby and you end up being the only player. You can fly around collecting checkpoints and level up to 100 with just a bit of patience. I wish this game's developers would just slap a price on this game and then put more work into it, because with some effort it could be really awesome.			"

												I'm  not going to say this is a bad game. It's not. It is however very much unpolished. Between the numerous grammar errors, which I'm going to attribute to the game being russian from what I understand, to hitboxes that make no sense. More than once I've taken damage from aparently thin air. I will praise the concept and the execution to a degree. Like I said, it's not bad, just unpolished. The graphics are decent, and the designs off the dragons are some of the most creative I've seen for some of them. Some are admitedly generic however.That being said, as much as I want to I just can't recommend it at the moment. If it wasn't free I'd suggest steering clear of it untill a later point.3/10Pros:Creative dragon designs for someRelatively easy to learn combatDecent enviroment designsCons:Exetremely generic dragon designs for the rest of them.Sevear glitchesHitboxes need workOnly two game modes			"

												TIME OF DRAGONS: singlehandedly the best videogame to be released on Steam ever since the fabled legend ""Bad Rats"". It's an easy comparison to make because both games have core values about them which distinguish themselves from every other game out there. Ranging from it's graphics (or lack thereof) to it's sluggish and incomprehendable gameplay there is every element in this game which bakes it bad... in the best way possible. Grab some buddies, get on the intercom system of your choice and slam some dragons with a variety of weaponry and support items at your fingertips (but the railgun and double cooling kit is by far the way to go, also Ogre is literally the best and if you don't buy him with your 3 DNA you're mental).There's nothing more satisfying than flying around a beachy map and attempting to line up your really dreadful crosshair up with the dragon bodies* as they glide in the air only to absolutely demolish them with your mighty Ogre dragon.*there's a f*cking stingray dragon in this game and it's stupid becAUSE IT'S NOT A DRAGON IS IT JUST GO PLAY SOME SH*TTY AQUARIUM GAME AND SWIM AROUND AS A STING RAY GET THE F*CK OUT OF MY DRAGON GAME DUDE.play this game			"

												This is a game with major potential. Seeing how the devs are still working on it as people are reporting bugs and other things, there's a high chance they're going to exploit that potential.For now, let's talk about the game in its current state. The graphics are good for now. My PC is pretty low-end but I can still run on the highest settings on the opening screen without dropping frames (however, there is an in-game setting for post effects that makes the game look ugly AND drops your frames immensely, so this setting should be removed or fixed pronto, but just turn it off in the in-game settings for now if you're having problems). Actual gameplay is very, very...FUN.I feel like I could play this game for hours on end without getting bored of it. Time will tell if that feeling will continue, but as of right now, everythings running a smooth course. Graphics, audio, animation... none of that really completely matters if the gameplay isn't fun. And this game's gameplay is straight up, pure, magical fun. I mean the concept itself sounds fun, just think about it! Fire-breathing dragons with missiles and lasers mounted to them? That's awesome! And the fact that it is executed so well in this game makes it all feel incredible.The only bad things in this game are the bugs and some of the audio. Let's start with that audio. The music in this game is pretty darn cool, but the sound effects are plainly sub-par. They need to be remastered in order for me to feel fully submerged into the game, because otherwise, it feels like there's no reality to this game when those fuzzy, low-qual dragon roars play. Now, the bugs are mostly with the HUD. Sometimes when you're in the options menu, you can't click the accept button. That's one example. There are also collision bugs regarding dragons running into walls even when they haven't even touched the walls. Other things, like certain flight animations, need to be polished and more rounded. But perhaps those animations help with the game's charm. Honestly, I really don't care about charm.All that matters is that you should give this game a shot. It's got class, fun, and dragons with GUNS on them for crying out loud. It deserves a chance, so try it out, at least for a half hour.TL;DR:This game has a couple bugs but it's incredibly fun, so try it!			"

												I'd have to say that I love this game. I learned the controls in just a few matches. They are simple enough for anyone to use, but have enough flexibility and complexity to pull of maneuvers you'd think came from a jet combat simulator. The health and damage system is adequate, being shot at is a real risk, unlike a lot of other first or third person shooters, where you'd think the character was the man of steel. Unlike other shooters, I managed to make my first kills in my very first match, which was very satisfying. A game that takes too long to offer the player some incentive to play, is hard to continue playing. Time of Dragons is not one of those games.For the most part, the game is evenly balanced (And the promise of biweekly updates means that whatever tweaks need to be made to keep it fair, can happen), the lack of ""upgrades"" in the usual sense making combat a test of skill over grinding. The sense of progression is present, and from the start the game offers you the opportunity to test out several of the different dragons, to see which fits your playstyle the best. There are dragons out there for a mix of niches, whether you like a heavy hitter or a swift and agile fighter. (Which appealed to me the most.)Sure, there isn't much content to this game. But do all games need content? The matches are quick, six minutes each if you join from the start, perfect for when you just want to take a break. But there's enough variation in the Team and Solo deathmatch modes and maps to offer several hours of unique play. No match feels quite the same. The matchmaking system itself could offer more, though it is relatively fair, and again, even a new player can trump the most experienced if they take a well-aimed shot.For being free-to-play, the game is astoundingly well put-together. It is the first shooter that I've been able to run at full resolution and graphics quality without losing the most precious commodity these game need, framerate. The maps are very well thought-out, with places to hide and ambush and space for an all-out dogfight. The music, unintruding and not distracting in the least (in fact, I would go as far as to say it is beautiful) is quite fitting to an aerial combat game like this,  a refreshing break from the grating ""hardcore"" shooter music. Sometimes when you're all alone in a match (It happens every once in a while) you'll find yourself just soaring around the map, feeling like the king of the world. Overall the game shows great promise in what is to come, and great fun in what is already there. I can see myself staying with this game for many months.			"

												It's free. It's fun. It's easy to learn. Click battle and you are playing with others fast.Good menus with no clutter.It runs fine on my windows 10. Draggons are unique.Weapons are unique for each draggon.Levels are colorful and vary.-I like the lizzard draggon. He looks kinda cute and deadly. He has cool skin. Flying about feels right and is fun. You can enjoy being agressive with attacks. You can be diving and curving in panic under fire. I haven't played that much yet but I think there is plenty of room for combat strategy. Jump in and try something different. Fall in love with a draggon and maybe this game will keep growing.

												Well, after 2 games, my first being the typical noob first try and the second a surprising time with 6 kills or so and the top of the team (and probably the cause of the opposite team decreasing in members by about 4) I'd say that this is a half decent game, the only problem I have noticed is that friendly fire is on, and being killed by your team while in close combat with the opposition isnt exactly, amazing. But with new gamemodes being added soon, this game is pretty good, also its free so it doesnt  hurt to try it			"

												This game was really fun, its a shooting game you can easily be good at in about 5-10 minutes, the animations are FANTASTIC, and the only thing I would do to improve the game is to have a third option (along side the two battle options) to just have a free, large, world where you can fly and hang out with other users.

												I'd have to say that I love this game. I learned the controls in just a few matches. They are simple enough for anyone to use, but have enough flexibility and complexity to pull of maneuvers you'd think came from a jet combat simulator. The health and damage system is adequate, being shot at is a real risk, unlike a lot of other first or third person shooters, where you'd think the character was the man of steel. Unlike other shooters, I managed to make my first kills in my very first match, which was very satisfying. A game that takes too long to offer the player some incentive to play, is hard to continue playing. Time of Dragons is not one of those games.For the most part, the game is evenly balanced (And the promise of biweekly updates means that whatever tweaks need to be made to keep it fair, can happen), the lack of ""upgrades"" in the usual sense making combat a test of skill over grinding. The sense of progression is present, and from the start the game offers you the opportunity to test out several of the different dragons, to see which fits your playstyle the best. There are dragons out there for a mix of niches, whether you like a heavy hitter or a swift and agile fighter. (Which appealed to me the most.)Sure, there isn't much content to this game. But do all games need content? The matches are quick, six minutes each if you join from the start, perfect for when you just want to take a break. But there's enough variation in the Team and Solo deathmatch modes and maps to offer several hours of unique play. No match feels quite the same. The matchmaking system itself could offer more, though it is relatively fair, and again, even a new player can trump the most experienced if they take a well-aimed shot.For being free-to-play, the game is astoundingly well put-together. It is the first shooter that I've been able to run at full resolution and graphics quality without losing the most precious commodity these game need, framerate.

												Ok, this game...8/10   To explain such a high rating, let me just say DRAGONS with FREAKING LAZER GUNS! That puts it pretty high in my sights for a one-play kind of game. Then I kept playing. You can only have 3 dragons in the start, but you can get all of them eventually. They cost 3 each and you get a point every level. This is not a pay-to-win at all, I didn't even see an option to pay. The graphics (highest setting) are a lot better than expected and the controls have the perfect balance of complexity (for detailed shooting and movement) and simplicity (for ease of play.)   The only problem I have for this game was the lack of tons of dragons (which wasn't expected anyways), for there is only 10. All of them are different enough to be interesting to play all of them. Also, there are only 2 game modes and a third to come. Free for all and Team deathmatch. The third is some kind of point control, or defend the location, or attack the blimps, or something like that.   More game modes, dragons, and the leveling actually doing something would be the only things I think could make it better. Game modes such as Capture the flag, or a storyline, or custom enemies spawning in, stuff like that. More content to improve replayability. The Dragons are cool as they are, but there are more kinds that can be made. Speciality ones like ones that can resist certain moves, but have a crappy super move. The leveling is a bit of a touchy subject, in the sense that I realize all the dragons are on the same playing field, and leveling that changes stats would make the game unfair. I like the idea of your level unlocking game modes, or perhaps arena rooms (more and more skilled rooms.)    I really like this game, it's exactly what I wanted in my childhood (and I am sure yours too.) I am glad I found it here. Good job developers!-Azure			"

The exp decreases when everytime I've log in the game. There's no Ping stated when in game, cause I need to know for some players that are lagging and hard to aim. Not much players are friendly, when I've talk in game, they're just not replying or even 1 talk in game, so it's not friendly. No upgrades to buy or skins, same weapons (No new wepons unlock tactics when you have upgrade the level) Example: Level 10 ""Some weapons are unlocked"" So that will be made players to be more addicting to play.Lastly the sound fx when choosing the dragons, some sounds are not fade out smoothly.

												Great game in development, lots of chances and potential, 120% worth a try. Have patience and this will be like a gem turning into a diamond, slow but steadily. Currently u need around 1-2 hours to completly understand the game, however once understood it is a lot of fun. Some tips to not be the nub:1: Change ur weapon in my opinion the plasma ball is currently the best, it deals high damage hard to dodge and is a good finisher, its super usefull for fast paced dragong like the fury and skat2. change ur equipment, when using the plasma ball u can shoot around 3 shots in rapid succesion before overheating, use the red cool down item on the 3/4 keys to instant cool down ur weapons for another 3 shots... 3. always move never stop the ogre might be an exeption but all other dragons are ez kills for a skat or fury once hovering4. enjoy and have fun dont troll and let ur skills speak not ur mouth :)			"

												This game is pretty good for a Unity game,you control a dragon who has laser weapons on his back,rockets and railguns.The controls are pretty easy to learn and this game is litteraly 100% FREE no micro-transactions,no DLCs, nothing, everything is already unlocked,except dragons you need 3 DNA points to unlock one and you make DNA points by leveling up at the beggining you will get 6 DNA points to make 2 Dragons so you'll have 3 Dragons from the start(with the beggining Dragon that everyone has)Overall it's a verry good game for a Unity Game and fun to play and the best part...I can run it at 60 FPS with my toast machine :P 7.5/10			"

												This is an awsome game! However, I do have a few recomendations:1) Singleplayer- Now, I love a good mmo as much as the next guy but I do belive that this game needs a singleplayer. because not everyone loves to fight fight fight. Some people just like to fly around and have fun as a amazingly animated dragon2) Peaceful mode- I think this game needs a peaceful multiplayer for many of the same reasons that it needs a singleplayer, with the addition of people wanting to talk with eachother and soar around on this game's rather pretty maps.3) Slowing Control- Sometimes you get going very fast and you need a control to slow down mid dive or something. An idea for the annimation could be the dragon flaring out it's wings and lashing out it's tail.But despite this game lacking a bit of content, it is a very fun game and I look foward to seeing it grow.

												A game that I find enjoyable if you like flying around shooting other dragons while being a dragon. The models in this game (the dragons you play as) are quite defined, some even looked quite bizarre. I enjoy complexity. The textures on the dragons are nice, even on low quality. The controls took just a little bit to get used to, but I really did got good at it about an hour later.A solid game for PVPers (the current game is pvp with my comment) out there looking to play as dragons shooting down other dragons with lasers and missiles.

												So game is sort of frustrating since seasoned players camp the spawn point and take you out immediately to get easy kills.  I was in team mode and my team members were nowhere to be found.  Also there appears to be a 'play with friends' aspect, but there is no friends-only version of the game, it's either versus all or team v team. The concept is pretty cool, but i'll get no experience if I just get killed instantly upon arriving on the scene by those spawn campers.			"

												So, I want to say that this game is awesome to a point. This game has a small player base which means that there are like 200 players and growing. This means that if you find a server with players your ok, however it takes about two tries. This is a game about Dragons shooting each other with rockets and lazers. There is not much to say about gameplay other than you can kill teammates if your not careful, or if they are being a♥♥♥♥♥♥ You have about 10 dragons you can play, each with different classes which changes speed and amount of guns. Heavy classes = slow and lots of guns, Light classes = not as slow with half as many guns.Graphics are decent, could be better though the devs seem to have abandoned the game. Sounds could also be better, the dragons roars are kind of weak.Altogether, it just needs players and some tweaking and this game would be warthunder, except less grinding and more fun.(And plz fix the spelling errors in the main menu, its kind of embarassing to look at).

												Actually pretty good, for what it is. It has very low system requirements, and it runs on unity. Graphics and AestheticsGraphics are good considering its low system requirements (My broken PC can run it!), but some textures are a bit eh, and animations are lacking in ""umf"" especially when you fire rockets and kill opposing dragons. The plasma lasers feel as they should, though a sound for them colliding with a dragon would be cool, instead of just numbers popping up. Rockets and Plasma Balls feel kinda eh as well.  The game is very colorful, and has a wide variety of dragons, which homage some familiar tropes (Such as the tyrannosaurus-esque Tiamat dragon, and the European starter dragon), as well as homaging familiar dragons in movies (The Fury and Ogre dragons in particular look like 2 particular dragons from How To Train Your Dragon, though only vaguely).StoryLiterally nonexistant, not even little bits of flavor text for each dragon. Not important, but would be nice to see!MechanicsFlying is fun, though going up and down feels a bit slow, and the flying can be quite sluggish at times. (Good luck zipping around corners, even with a fast dragon!) The combat options are lacking, 1 machine-gun esque weapon for each dragon, an option of a Plasma Ball, Rocket, or Rail Shot for a secondary weapon, and 2 accessory slots for things like mines and things to restore your cooldowns. Each dragon also has its own unique ""ultimate"" ability, which is the only difference between dragons aside from their stats. Each can equip the same weapons. It feels kind of boring, honestly. More variety in weapon types would make this much more fun. The cooldown time for using your weapons feels too restrictive, and all the dragons have the same cooldowns. The actual combat, however, is fun and intuitive, which is what really matters for a game this simple. Zipping, dodging, and dogfighting another dragon can be quite fun.Misc criticismsIn TDM, theres no indicator telling what is an allied dragon or an enemy dragon. Friendly fire is on. This need to be fixed.Not enough players, but this will change with time, as its a very new game.The progression system is kind of pointless, really.Overall?Reccomended, especially for free! I advise the devs to start building some new weapons options for the dragons, and refining their movement system.			"

												This game is simple, yet very addictive. I After spending only 1 hour in the game so far, I already know I will be spending a lot more time in it as the days go by. The graphics are not the greatest, but where that is lacking, the gameplay makes up for it. The game seems very well balanced You have a small list of weapons to choose from and can only use your main weapon and one other you choose from a small list. You also have a couple other items you can choose to aid you in your fight such as a smoke screen. Starting off in the game, you have only one dragon to use. Once you gain a few DNA points, you can start unlocking more dragons. Each dragon has 1 special ability that is on a cool down. Fire breathing, heal, blind, ect...Even though it is a very simple game and currently has only two game modes, Team play and Free for all, I highly recommend this game. It is fast paced, quick, and loads of fun.

												Boring. Simply, boring.It's not a bad game. It's just, boring.There is nothing really to captivate me. The flying mechanics feel like you just took a load of helicopters and strapped dragon skins onto them. You could have made cool momentum based flying mechanics with the wings, stamina, etc.Take Air Brawl for example. It's so satisfying to fly around buildings and into caves and stuff. But this game? You just float around for a bit, and shoot people. I was hoping for bad♥♥♥♥♥dragon dogfights. I guess you can't always get what you want.			"

												This game has a lot of potential, and it will take little work to reach that potential. unfortunately, whenever I try to play as a dragon, the screen automatically looks up so i can't fly anywhere. i really do think with a bit of bug fixing and maybe a bit of a less lazy job done with the audio, this game could be amazing. so here are the pros and cons:Pros:Diverse DragonsVery creative idea in generalThere is a  dragon made of FREAKING BATSCons:Graphics are subpar. not terrible, but still could use a bit of work.Audio sounds lazy and unedited(when a dragon roars it just cuts off rather than fading away the noise}Has quite a few bugs. even though this game is extremely new, it has some bugs that make you unable to play the game.So there. It has a few good things and a few bad things. all the bad things aren't that hard to fix, aside from maybe the graphics a little bit. but overall, I feel like the creators have done a lazy job on this that could easily be an absolute masterpiece provided a few things are changed. That's all from me.EDIT: after the recent update the game has gotten amazingly better. bug fixes are eminent and it feels that much more like a game that could take off. Keep up this work team, you're making your way to a big game!			"

												So far I haven't experienced any unfair games, nothing like 1v5 or 2v5. I have seen wierd text layouts in the chats but some people that I've talked to have normal, english texts. Other than that, this game is really good and I strongly recommend it to anyone who's looking for an air combat game.			"

												very highly recommended.it has good team play(other than there isn't an auto-balancing system so you might get 5v1)high variety of dragons ranging from being able to turn around and chase/flee in .5 seconds to barely being able to turn.many special ablities and more that i cant even think of right now.i currently have 4.8 hours on record and am about to go continue playing.i hope you get the game so you can enjoy it for yourself.oh yea,the primaary country that plays this is russian so if you're english i recommend google translate.

												If this game cost money, I would've sold my unborn children to play it. This game is really fun, albeit rather difficult. Flying the dragon and shooting things at the same time is very distracting, and also very dangerous. If texting and driving cars is dangerous, imagine flying a dragon in traffic and shooting things with it. I would have to recommend that a driving course be given for the dragon and rider. Would I recommend this game?! You're ♥♥♥♥ing right I would tell all of my friends about it!			"

												ironically- the night before i found this game- a buddy of mine and I were talking about why there isnt a 'dog fighting dragon game' where you get to ride dragons and attack others and such.Then i found this.Super fun- easy to pick up- beautiful game and the best part is the flight aspect of it seems super awesome/quite realistic. The heavier dragons feel SO much clunkier versus the lighter ones- which is fanfriggen tastic.Only downside is I can't hop online WITH anybody and either create my own team or just fight each other to see who's top gun XDgive these guys some support- they've done damn well			"

If you have nothing else better to do, I'd say give it a try.			"

												I recommend the game highly.Only 2 things to consider highly before playing this:1: People are laggy as hell and it's really annoying when you waste energy a lot for just 1 shot.2: Enery regen and stam regen are slow so DO NOT WASTE. This game makes you place shots on targets, and penalizes you for missing.			"

												It's like How to Train Your Dragon mixed with planetside 2. The game has a great graphic model including the dragons but it needs more ""stuffs"" I should say... Like customizable dragons, upgradable stats for dragons or maybe more gameplay types. To be short this game is nice but it needs more ""stuffs"".			"

												Seriously, very unique and fun.Nothing I can find thats bad against the game (Except for matchmaking) and also one other thing. There is a bug in which you go into the game, the round finishes and you are transitioning between the rounds. BUT THEN the time of dragons loading screen pops up and blocks the view of the game. This bug is quite COMMON.8/10 just fix that bug and it will be a 9.5/10			"

												Amazing game. Only flaw is that it uses the Unity Engine which makes remapping mouse buttons IMPOSSIBLE, apparently. They  also need to let us rebind the freaking chat keys OMG! But it's incredibly fun and once you get used to flying and using your abilities you can have even MORE fun. This is the F2P game I've been waiting for. Casual, easy, great atmosphere. People are CRAZY to be down-voting this game. It's not even finished yet and is already a great experience.			"

												This is a great game, love it, to me it's very addicting. I think it should have maybe a small tutorial in the beginning because I was just thrown into the game without knowing how to play, but I figured it out. Also I think it would be nice if there was a map to where you could just train on different strategies, and If you could design the color and design of your dragon to make it more custom(You would still have the basic shape of the dragon). So anyway, great game I think if you would add these things it would make it a little better.			"

												11/10 would ride a dragon again.5/7 perfect game.Seriously, just wait for the bugfixes and it'll be awesome, also the grinding is almost non existent, you can basically get all sort of dragons in 10 hours playing at most. You get free skins really quickly too, i don't even know how they'll earn money tho.The gameplay is kind of easy to take in hand and the different weapon are nice, thus the deathmatch mode is kind of not really interesting to stay on, but the other may be really attractive.For a 7 devs game, it shouldn't be as good as it is.

												I really like the idea, it also is a really awesome game.But i do have some thing you guys could really improve on and may be something that makes me play the game a lot.The controls are really wanky, it doesnt controll very well.And i found this game because i was bored and wanted a fun game to play with my friends who were bored as well then i found this game but you cant join eachother or make a party so we couldnt play this game together.Those are the two things i think this game should really improve on.I really like the game but that are the only downsides i found.

												You play as dragons with laser packs.  'nuff said.There's not a lot of content at the moment, BUT it's free and the devs appear to be dedicated to adding stuff over time and fixing issues.  My humble non-gaming-quality PC could run it well enough on medium graphics.  You even start with enough in-game currency to unlock 2 dragons right away.  Most importantly, it's fun!  Give it a try!

												11/10 would ride a dragon again.5/7 perfect game.Seriously, just wait for the bugfixes and it'll be awesome, also the grinding is almost non existent, you can basically get all sort of dragons in 10 hours playing at most. You get free skins really quickly too, i don't even know how they'll earn money tho.The gameplay is kind of easy to take in hand and the different weapon are nice, thus the deathmatch mode is kind of not really interesting to stay on, but the other may be really attractive.For a 7 devs game, it shouldn't be as good as it is.

												This game is fantastic, and it's free to play at the moment no reason not to give it a shot.The only bad things about the game is that is has no matchmaking for friends, no lobby, the leaderboards don't update often and perhaps some of the abilities are not quite balanced. The chat system is a bit wonky too. Didn't take me too long to unlock all the dragons either.However considering it is quite a new game and all of these things will be addressed soon it's just nitpicking. Oh and it's free - I can't even give the developers money...hopefully they eventually implement a cash shop for cosmetics for the dragons to spice up the looks of all the dragons. "

												it's a good game if you want the unexpected. If you want a challenge. First off, because there aren't many people on EU servers at least; my ping is good but team matches are 3v3 at most in my experience. second, there are a lot of abilities and stuff that are unexpected and it does have the substance of mechanics for an fps (tps?) while being fairly simple.Dragons aren't maneuvorable but that's like.......... that's what dragons are like man. These dragons. I love them. If you like dragons and aerial combat you'll like this game. And hey, give it a shot, even if you don't feel particularly enthusiastic. It's free, and I played 50 minutes the first time I tried it because I lost track of time.  "

												The intro tutorial was broken  so that you couldn't actually continue past learning to fire. The gameplay wasn't great. The controls felt sluggish and the spawning mechanic seems very broken. Often times I would spawn in away from the main fight and while on my way towards the group to engage a player would spawn in right behind me at t he place I had just spawned. I even had times when other players were spawned literally right behind me less than a second after I spawned. That combined with the sluggish movements makes it difficult to swing around deal with the person who just came in. The shooting mechanic works on a cooldown mechanism. So after continued fire for so long you have to wait for your dragon to cool down before you can start firing again. The problem is that the dragon overheats so quickly that it's nearly impossible to get a kill on an enemy without overheating. This makes it frustrating to chase and enemy just to overheat and have another player swoop in to steal your kill while you're waiting to cool down.Played with a couple of friends and we all lost interest after about half an hour.

Time to LeaveOverviewI didn't play this game for very long before coming to my conclusions, and really, you don't have to play the game long at all to know what it's about. Time of Dragons was a pretty fun and clever concept, with dragons carrying turrets on their back and blazing into an all-out war with other dragon species. It seems like a rare breed. However, it's spoiled by one fatal flaw: it's multiplayer PvP only.The Positives1) Engaging, action-filled combat. It's fun to see stuff explode.2) The dragons, while kind of blocky and mushy-looking, have cool designs, and they're all unique from each other.3) The game is free to play, and there's no P2W system of any kind.The Negatives1) It was fun for five minutes, then started getting boring really fast, mostly because of your lack of options. Do you want to PvP in this way or this way? It's all the same thing: kill the other players and win. There was no variety whatsoever, and the few choices you do have aren't very interesting.2) I couldn't really get a leg-up in terms of experience since everyone who was playing seemed to be higher and better than me. Again, this made the game boring pretty quickly, because there is no skill scaling. What's the point of fighting if I can't win anything? Not fun. Moving on.3) The abilities don't seem to do anything. I've hit my special ability several times on enemies and tried like hell to get it to land on them. It doesn't seem to hurt them. Even if it did, they usually managed to kill me before I could tell. I tried the fire blast with Tiamat and vampirism thing that drains health with Vampire, and neither seemed to hurt the enemy. Maybe I just couldn't land it right, but should it really be that hard to land? Especially in a high-action environment where I don't have a lot of time to swoop in and hump the enemy before using my ability?4) Almost the entire playerbase was Russian for some reason. So I couldn't even chat with people. Even if I could, it's not like I'd have anything to say except ""Hey, can you help me kill this dragon so I don't die again?"" I'm sure if I banged my head on the keyboard a bunch of times, it'd have the same effect.5) There's no single-player or PvE options, so if you enter a battleground and see no other players... that's it. You have to leave and join another one and hope you have other people to play with. And if you're on at the wrong time of day, no one at all will be around. Unless they're Russians, I guess. Which is fine, if you're Russian.6) Turning is slow as hell and has gotten me killed more than once. Even when using an evasive maneuver, it was impossible to avoid an attack if the dragon was already on your♥♥♥♥♥7) It says each dragon has a ""role"" but they don't come into play at all. Players don't really stick together (because the teams are usually 2 or 3 people), so roles are pointless. It's pretty much what you think works best for keeping your♥♥♥♥♥alive. So pick a dragon with high health and high damage every time so you have a fighting chance.Final ThoughtsThere's nothing special about it. It's just mundane multiplayer PvP with players you can't understand. Skip this one and move on. Unless you like to be frustrated. Then be my guest.It could very well be that I played the game at ""the wrong time of day"" and maybe more US players join in the evening, but that still shouldn't matter. Whether you're playing in the morning of evening, you should still see more than ten players at a time.			"

												Time of Dragons is a fun game. That's all I have to say. (ALERT! HUGE WALL OF TEXT INCOMING!) Now on to why I gave it a negative review. It's a fun game, but not a good game. The reason I say this is because of how new it is. It just gets repetitive after a bit, because there aren't any other weapons from what I have seen, and you get everything but the dragons free. When you start the game, you get 6 DNA points, and a starter dragon.  Every level up you get is 1 dna point, and you may expend 3 dna points to buy a new dragon. Simple concept, simple game. But the only problem is there are only two gamemodes, and once you get all the dragons or just all the dragons you want, you're done and have no reason to play except just to have fun shooting down other dragons. Now, after maybe a month or 2 I may edit this review, but for now in its current state it's just a good idea. (NOTE TO DEVELOPER: Please for the love of god do not add a premium currency or microtransactions! PLEASE! You have a great game in the makings, take it and run!)			"

												If you're looking for some quick fun, then this game is definitely worth a quick download and a couple hours of play at least. You're literally a ♥♥♥♥ing dragon/(insert other flying beasts) with ♥♥♥♥ing laser strapped to your ♥♥♥♥ing back fighting other dragons with ♥♥♥♥ing laser strapped on their ♥♥♥♥ing back. You want anything more for free? Didn't think so. It's not polished, it's a little clunky, but this game has heart. The Devs seem pretty responsive to the community which is always a plus. F2p with no micros or pay to win. Give it a whirl.tl;dr: ♥♥♥♥ing laser mounted dragons fighting in air with one another with decent dogfighting mechanics. For free.10/10 ♥♥♥♥ing laser mounted beasts.			"

												It's...I can't get past the horrible UI (no clear indication of options available as opposed to what's just part of the UI's scenary and information. The +1DNA received on a level-up looks clickable).Not to mention the optimization is absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ A difference of 5-10fps from low to high and it's always sub 20 in combat.

												Terrible. Just terrible. Concept is cool, and unique. I mean it's dragons with frickin' laser beams, what's not to like right? Well, the controls are terrible, the tutorial is broken. It's essentially a moba/deathmatch. Again, I hate those, but that is personal preference. If I ever find one that's actually enjoyable for me, that opinion may change.In the one battle I managed to live more than 30 seconds, everyone in the group was speaking/typing in Cyrillic, so I had no clue what they were saying. While I can't exactly fault the game for that, it certainly made for an utterly unenjoyable experience.			"

												*Sigh* I'm going to be frank.Pros:- You get to play as a dragon, *****ing duh.- Originality of the dragons. (In my opinion, the game could use dragons with different weapons, like Tiamaut or whatever having rockets or something. Also, could use more dragons, as stated in cons. For instance, a Hydra or Ice dragon, something of that magnitude.)Cons:- Clunky, kind of poor controls.- Limited number of players.- Disappointing amount of dragons to play as.I may download this game again ONLY if you fix those things. For now, though, I am sorry to say I have removed the game. I hope to see that it has improved in the future.			"

												Time of Dragons is a really fun roguelike game about rebels (the Punks) fighting against an authoritarian government. Gameplay consists of attacking bunkers (FPS sections) to acquire gear, credits and tech, then going back to base and using the collected credits to buy new rooms & room upgrades, which will then grant your characters bonuses. When a character dies, he/she gives a permanent bonus to other characters, and when all characters die, it's game over and you're taken to the marketplace, where you can use your collected tech to buy new Punks, gear, weapons, rooms, room upgrades, room slots and character slots.As the game is currently (July 29th, 2016), version 0.2.1, the game is still lacking in content, as it'd be expected of such an early version. But even then, I still had some good hours of fun with this - 9 hours registered right now, which were needed to unlock everything currently available. If at this current, early development state I was already able to have so much fun, I can only wonder how many hours I'd put into this once the full version is out.As it'd be expected of an early version of the game, there are a few issues, but only one is worth mentioning right now, which is an issue with enemy hitbox sizes. Sometimes, the aim reticle can be right on top of an enemy, but it still shows up as white (meaning the shot will miss).However, the dev is active and listening to player feedback, taking note of all issues reported and fixing them ASAP.Definitely a game worth supporting and recommending. Even as an early access title, I still recommend it at full price.			"

You started with Cronos, the generic fire-breathing dragon. Then there's a healer, stunner, AoE, flashbanger (ish, blinds enemies, effect is like a flashbang), and many more! Dragons with lasers and rockets, what's NOT to love? TRY IT!Edit: You get 1 DNA Per Level.			"

												I like this a lot. It's just the right amount of slightly silly, coupled with good solid game mechanics, interesting level topology and swoopy flying. it DOES have a slightly cheap feel, but the myriad features and optimizations that would be required to make a game like this run like the new DOOM does would require a huge budget and a large pricetag.  This is very healthy small studio development at its finest. everything works, there are a pleasing amount of upgrades that i was able to earn in a half hours play session, there are some people on servers and the UI makes most stuff pretty clear. the actual dragonfighting is fun! it's slower paced than other flight or dogfighting games and theres a large variety of animations in the dragon characters which make it feel very natural and cool to flap and glide around and do popup attacks and dive in for the kill. a full server would be very awesome.I would like to see perching and hanging implemented, as you can't land anywhere - your dragon fumbles around until you can flap ungracefully back into the sky.  im thinking of the batman games style drop/snatch attacks here. also going to moan in passing aboutgeneral art direction (it all looks a bit disjointed, get a theme going on to tie it all together)level art quality (maybe you guys should stylize this thing?)lighting (black dragons get old fast)some level topography (the nightworld map with all its tunnels and overlooks is my favourite so far, some of the other levels need more height to be more of a playground for flying)but omfg dragons! reccomended!

												This is a early play reviewBasically this game looks like a typical dogfighter, however, instead of jets or helicopters you control a dragon. just thinking that a flying manta ray could be classified as a monster, I'm not sure it fits into the ""dragon"" catagory.Each dragon has a different characteristics and special abilities that are indicitive of that species. Blinding the enemy, breathing fire for close range combat, Poison, explosive blast, vampiric leaching of life, stunning, healing yourself and ally etc.Limited purchasable items are available for the dragons. Items can be won or earned by logging into the game or after the match via the lottery. The items currently include skins or ""DNA Points"" for the dragons but not much else.Weapons, dragons, abilities can't be upgraded using points as far as I have seen but I could be wrong.The arenas are nicely constructed with beautiful detail and they range in size, but aren't very dynamic. ie No destructable content. (The plasma orb that can kill a dragon won't leave a burn mark on the landscape let alone make a pit in the ground or walls)As for the gameplay, the controls aren't very difficult. Standard w,s,a,d movement with q and e as altitude control.The shield (triggered by holding the right mouse button) isn't very good as you may try to use it and it doesn't respond right away, or sometimes at all.It is fun, if you have the patience for a game based on repitition with little depth. I'll suggest a few ideas even though I doubt they will be taken up.Adding a Campaign Mode would help players understand the backstory and reasons why anyone would strap weapons to a dragon and set it lose.Adding a system to allow players to spend DNA points on the dragons base abilities such as speed, stamina, health etc would go a long way towards making this a great game.Setting up the matches to be based on the players level would be a required so nobody can twink the dragon and troll people with lower levels and are just begining ie a level 10 harassing a level 3 just because they can and find it funny. IMO thats why most early players don't return to a game that could be great.			"

												Dragon based MMO for online combat, realistic textures but with some unrealistic features, including the fact you shoot lasers from the back of each dragon to attack. You are flying genetically modified dragons from the lab and testing your wits and skills against other players.As for the dragons themselves, they are customizable with various skins you win at random through prize boxes. You can keep the skins or combine them for better skins and lastly to unlock the ultimate DNA form for each specific dragon. But unlike the combat system, creating new dragons in the lab can be a bit dull and slow paced. You will have to focus on battles upon battles to get anywhere with this.The battle lineup is random, as in, you are placed often with players beyond your skill level... like a level 5 versing a level 54... it makes the lower level characters easy prey. The bonus at least to this is All-on-All battles normally award xp still at the end of the round. Suggested improvements for the future: * An option to verse players within your skill level* Ability to sell/trade double skins on the market			"

												First and formost please do not let my negative revew stray from the fact that this is an awswome gameAWSOME BUT BROKEN atleast from a high end high speed gamer its actualy rather SLOW and unproductive in terms of the actual battle machanics thease mechanics are not broken in on them selves but they are not properly configuredit can take upwords of 15 minuets for an unskilled player to get a kill (that is if you can manage to live that long) most of this is because of the ""reload times"" or rather as the game machanics place it heat if the heat didnt take so long to disapate it be a great game but you more or less end up with alot of 1 shot wepions that dont even kill in that one shot most wepions it takes 2 or 3 clean hits to kill with the exspetion of the basic wepion your given that fires more like a single burst mag burst wepion like serousely wheres the sustainable constent wepions wheres the ""LMG"" based wepions all i see in it are ""rocket launchers and advanced snipers"" with respects to the actual guns to their basic counterparts or in simpler terms their wepions are more like call of duty / counterstrike with nothing but handguns and slow dogeable rocket launchersGive me something that i can fire for 2 minuets stright or speed up the heat disapation and this would quickly change			"

												This game looked interesting to me, so I decided to check it out. The tutorial was fun for me, no glitches experienced. I enjoyed flying and diving into the water at that part. It gave me starry eyes. Then when I actually got into the game for battle for the first time, there was nobody else to fight, so I went to a different server. People were there, but I couldn't spawn in! My dragon was invisible, wouldn't load, and wouldn't move. I assumed it was a poorly made ""Spectator mode."" So, I joined another server. The round was getting ready to begin in 5 seconds. I waited patiently. As soon as the round began, my dragon was STILL invisible and couldn't move. That's when it hit me. ""This isn't a Spectator Mode! It's a glitch!"" Literally every time I tried to play, this ""no-spawn"" glitch occured. Making it very unenjoyable. Sometimes I would even get the ""battle prize"" at the end of the battle without even having gotten a chance to battle. How frustrating. Later on in the game, I got a crate full of 6 DNA, and decided to get a new dragon with it. Guess what? That new dragon actually worked and allowed me to spawn and play. Wow. That's a bad sign when your DEFAULT dragon that you automatically get when you first begin the game doesn't work outside of the tutorial. Imagine if I had 0 DNA. I wouldn't have been able to experience anything.Because of this game-stopping glitch, I can't really recommend this game. It's not even just the glitch though. It's also the fact that there are OTHER glitches, such as the match not ending correctly. It's also the fact that I don't like how the servers work, you can't choose which server you want to go on to. The game randomly picks one. Meaning you could spawn into a game with 0 players, or spawn into a game with 2 players, or a game with 8 players. It would be better if I could personally choose which server I want to spawn in, so I always spawn in a populated one. Also, the aiming. The aiming isn't too great. It's slow. (Dunno quite if that's because of the dragon I chose or because that's how the game is.) You can turn your dragon to face the target head on, but the targetting icon will still be trying to catch-up with your screen. So, because of that, you could be facing a target, but still shoot to your left or right, completely missing the target because the icon literally represents where your dragon will shoot, it's not just there for visual help.I'll probably keep the game just for something to play when I get a little bored, since it has a nice concept and there are still aspects about it I like, but there are too many cons for me to suggest it to anyone else.

Product received for free
												NOTE TO DEVS:It's a good game - with a wonderful concept. In all honesty, at the moment - the only thing I could reccomend to make it better would be the ability to change your hotkeys (as Left Shift can be annoying when you're trying to speed up and drop mines at the same time - at the moment, it feels kind of like combat is W+M1 no matter what dragon I'm playing.)I feel like it could also greatly benefit from controller support for gameplay.Aside from these things, I believe it's a good game. The dragon classes are balanced and the ability to customize your playstyle no matter which dragon you're using by changing weapons and gadgets is refreshing. Keep up the good work.(P.S. I'll do an actual review at a later date once I've played it more)			"

												This game is really great and i love it. It makes fun and you can also play with your steam-friends. But the only thing that makes all good things bad: IT LAGS ALMOST EVERY TIME I PLAY! That is really annoying because I get killed  when the game lags (it didnt help me to restart the game). Until it isnt fixed, i wont recommend this game because this stupid lag is terribly annoying. >:(			"

Product received for free
												I wouldn't give this a negative beause it's free, but I'll give it a not recommended becaue I can't really see telling anyone to play this. EnviromentSoundModelsPerformanceCustomizationand UI ....are all kind poor.  It's a game where you slowly move about in space using the mouse to point your direction and wasd keys to strafe or go forwards/backwards.  As you know you control dragons that have weapons on them and do various modes like PVP and PVE, but it's all no better than the dragon segments in Divinity II.  In fact I would recommend Divinity II over this even though you have to pay for it despite it being a different genre.			"

												although i haven't played much of this game, what i did play wasn't enyoable at all.yes the dragons look cool and the concept is greathowever sometimes the audio is missing but mij main concerns are:1 everyone has the same main weapon which is lame2 aiming can be difficult leading to some awkward situations3 there is no real progression, you unlock no other dragons as you level up (not to my knowledgde)although i still believe that this game over time can be really fun, for now im just going to stick with star conflict			"

												Honestly the game looked good, but it's not in my opinion. It's difficult the shoot, the spawn is instant death and space should be a way to go upwards. This game just isn't doing it for me. There weren't a lot of different dragons to choose from, and multiplayer battles are way unfair. Like I said before, they spawnkill. Stamina for the dragons are too low, the night fury lookin' thingy was not only copied in some ways, but the major ability (R) sucks. It does no damage unless you aim it perfectly. I'm very disappointed in this game.... I don't regret installing it, but I do see that it needs major fixes. Until the game is actually complete and has a storyline or purpose to it, I won't be playing this too often.			"

This is not an MMO (or not yet), the game consist in dogfight between a very small number of dragons (4v4 or 8 in free for all).you can choose between a few weapons and some dragons.But the game is still bugged. There are a few graphical glitches, but this won't prevent the game from being playable.some bugs I noticed:- no tool tips appearing- weapon selection don't work for me- tools usage don't work- key binding seems buggedwhen finish this game will be nice, but not now.

												I dont have a lot of time on this game so if you want a review coming from more experience then keep scrolling. This game has promise and is fun for the first few minutes you play it. But after a while its boring and has some issues. 'First of all the shield. The shield should not stop you from firing. When you leave the shield up for a while it eventually goes down. When it does you cannot fire leaving you totally open to get shot. Secondly there isnt a very good warning for when you get shot. Sometimes you seem like you get shot from nothing. There is no visual warning and you still take dammage. Finally you should not take dammage from your shortest hair on your left claw getting grazed by a rock. It knocks like 200 hp off and its very annoying. If you only have a few minutes in a day to play some games and you want a airborne simple shooter game then this is the game for you. Otherwise i would wait for it to get better. It has alot of promise and i hope for the developers to expand on it			"

Up and down being E and Q? Who plays like that?? How do you go forward + up + right at the same time??Also, without mouse smoothing it becomes very twitchy.All the dragons looked like a 10 year old drew them, or they were aimed at a customer base of that age, I don't know.

												Game is dead af. Team against team matches are almost always uneven; 3v6, 1v4. Solo Deathmatch games are pointless as I've never seen them with more than 3 players.Would be a great game if it had a fanbase. Sadly, it doesn't.*deletes*			"

Olso evry dragon have difrent stats and difrent special moves wich i like to call ultimates. I simply LOVE this game I once recomended for the dev to put skyns in the game that you must pay for to get them so this game could grow funds and he did add them but even better he made them obtainable by just playing the game that is just cool I love that you can evolve your dragons in better forms when you have all the skins for the respective dragon.THIS GAME IS A LOT OF FUN.I rly like it and has a rly big potential.I would rly like some better grafics butis a fun game none the less.i cant whait for the excort mode			"

Seems to be working now, this partially eliminates the need for a manual (When it works). I still dont see how people are getting mines. (Shrug) Perhaps I missed it somewhere.			"

												The Trailer is completely misleading. The graphics are so unpolished. ALL the trees are the same model. Game randomly crashes, the only mode I could get to work was the Free For All mode where people just spam shots at you before you know whats going on as you load in.The lag is atrociously bad, people just appear instantly around you then disappear... the controls are bad, the cursor for shooting takes 5 seconds to line up with the dragons turning (which doesnt make sense if its mounted on the dragon).All the talking is in russian too.  The only reason this is free 2 play is to get any positive reviews because I guarantee if you paid anything for this you would NOT be happy.  Do Not even try this mess out..			"

												so i just tried to play this game (5/19/2016). after starting the game i'm greeted with a screen of a dragon in the middle a list of locked dragons to the right and a box of stats to the left. no intro screen, no tutorial. after mucking about i found the menu by hitting escape and found the 3 graphics options (after effects, bloom, and v-sync). i've personlly seen more options on a console port so this is unacceptable. control mapping or even a list of what buttons do what i couldnt find. after that i tried to get into a game and saw that i was on a team of 2 vs 3 players. i waited on the countdown expecting to be thrown into my first game under prepared but nope just onto a new lobby with new people. i exited that lobby and returned to the dragon screen. i tried to re enter the lobby and found a very small tutorial button hidden in the top right corner that i missed the first time. onto the turorial, it started by telling me how to move with wasd. thats right it thinks you dont even know how to move. after i'm done with that it shows me strafe and speed boost with space bar and shift. next it wants me to shoot and watch out for heat. i'm guessing that heat deals with some type of weapon as i wasnt able to proceed past this point. it said to hold left mouse button and well i guess its a bug because neither the built in laptop left click nor my usb mouse left click did anything. i proceeded to press everybutton on my keyboard and mouse and even turned on my steam controller trying to get it to do something. i think i pressed x on my steam controller and it brought up a menu to resume or leave and at this point i just left the game. how the hell did this game even get released on steam? i suppose it could be that i run linux (xubuntu 14.04.2lts) but that is the platform that steam recommends for all its games (they recommend ubuntu 14.04 but its basiclly the same). i know that beggers cant be choosers but even facebooks flash games actually work.

Just like many games in the iphone app store.-Easily breakable servers. just spawn as toxor and press r to ruin everyones match.-Cheeki breekis that use hacks and invade servers.-Boring gameplay with no enviromental interaction except water that kills you even if you are the ray.-Only gamemodes you can find ppl on are dm and tdm the rest are dead. this comes in handy if you idle for crates.-fury is basically a bootleg version of how to tame your dragon's nightfury except with a rattlesnake head.-moderators that ban you from the forums just for being better at the game than them- terrible and weird backstory that makes no sense with some of the weirdest names like Adiopants, Niel, Ahros and many more confusing terms.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------overall score: 3/10 would rather play CrazyBus.

												Wow, this game really impressed me! I thought that this was going to be one of those games that tries for the overly B.A. thing like, ""LOOK DRAGON WITH GUNS AAAAA"" but this game is so much more!For starters, There is a wide variety of different dragons to play as, each with their own sort of theme. There's one that looks like a manta ray, one taht reminds me of a snake, etc. There is a design for everyone here, and the diversity is very nice.The Gameplay is very smooth as well. I've some across many games taht fail horribly to do the whole ""flight"" thing, but Time of Dragons does it soooooo well. It feels very satisfying to kill airborne enemies, and I love playing this game.If I had any complaints, they would be taht this gamee definately has some graphical issues. They're not huge, but some textures are a bit weird at times, and models/animations can look a bit stiff from close up. If anything, it makes the game run easier on lower-tier computers like mine, so I'll give it a pass.I reccommend this game to anyone looking for a fun game that's easy to get into.			"

												I really enjoy the game and i recomend it to anyone who like shooters. its a very unique game thats a shooter(not an fps) you fly a dragon and shoot lazers from a turret mounted on its back, which is freeking awesome.the game is in an eary stage so it could use some fixes here and there. The graphics arent the best but certanly not the worst iv ever seen. the dragon flight works really well.  each dragon has its own set of stats and each dragon is fairly balenced. i hope there is a tutorial level in the future seeing as when you stat of you go in blind, but its an easy game to get the hang of. The maps are unique and are well made. as of when i post this there are only two game modes, team battle and free for all, (i hope in the future there will be more) for casual and hardcore playstyles. each weapon is balanced and so are the items. if your on the look out for a free shooter i really recomend this game.

												... Ehh, don't particularly care for the ""concept"" of dragons and laser blasters.There are obviously some kinks that could be worked out, and I feel that there are certain things to the game that could be improved on.~Me personally, I'd like fire and shield to have seperate ""energy bars"" but that could lead to potential problems,   so I can understand why that would not be a thing.~Targetting could be a bit easier, though I don't particularly know how it could be made so.  Maybe the crosshair could turn red when targetting another dragon?As far as other things go : Well, there's really nothing much in the game right now.For one, we could definitely use more dragons to choose from. And I think we can all agree that customizable dragons is a thing that we all crave.But all that aside, I enjoy the game VERY much.

												Gonna get straight to the point. Controls are very crude and there is no tutorial to explain things, and even then the response times for your keys and mouse clicks lag at times. You're thrown right into the game with no guidance on what to do, a big no-no in my opinion. The concept is cool but the execution HAS improved since the first time I've played and reviewed this game. The game still has some iffy parts with hitboxes and some balance things, but with the added tutorial and general updates since then I think this game is an interesting and fun way to both pass the time and maybe even have fun doing so.If you like dragons with lasers (who doesn't?) then this is the game for you!

Its free, basically takes no requirements, and is great. If you dont like it? uninstall it. Just try it, so so funny			"

												Wow, this game really impressed me! I thought that this was going to be one of those games that tries for the overly B.A. thing like, ""LOOK DRAGON WITH GUNS AAAAA"" but this game is so much more!For starters, There is a wide variety of different dragons to play as, each with their own sort of theme. There's one that looks like a manta ray, one taht reminds me of a snake, etc. There is a design for everyone here, and the diversity is very nice.The Gameplay is very smooth as well. I've some across many games taht fail horribly to do the whole ""flight"" thing, but Time of Dragons does it soooooo well. It feels very satisfying to kill airborne enemies, and I love playing this game.If I had any complaints, they would be taht this gamee definately has some graphical issues. They're not huge, but some textures are a bit weird at times, and models/animations can look a bit stiff from close up. If anything, it makes the game run easier on lower-tier computers like mine, so I'll give it a pass.I reccommend this game to anyone looking for a fun game that's easy to get into.			"

												Why does this game have 'mixed' for reviews?  There must have been a game-breaker bug that's been fixed since I started playing it.Well I haven't logged much time but the time I did log was a lot of fun!  Lots of choices for dinos to pick from, looks like you can upgrade stuff, and though I haven't really gotten familiar with the interface enough to make any valid complaints or praises (lack of any tutorial that I can find so far), it was easy and intuitive enough to figure out what to do without really knowing what to do beforehand.  Being able to come out 1st place in a few matches without really knowing what's going on makes you want to keep playing, know what I mean?All in all I'd say this is worth checking out and I hope to see it expand!  I'd likely pay for this if it had a cost involved, since it would help with the time/effort spent towards doing just that - but always nice to be able to try it before making that decision too.			"

												It seems to have potential. I read somewhere that you could upgrade dragons/weapons, but I don't see that anywhere. Whenever I try to play any game mode or any tutorial, the game ""crashes"". A little window (that is invisible in the task bar) pops up behind the main game, making it almost impossible to find it. This box just says that the game has crashed, and to close the program you have to hit ok. To me, this shows that the developers don't really care about the people. If they cared, they would made it really apparent that the game has crashed and not just ask you to send a game log to them.I must say, the game (considering how small the development team was) was quite impressive. The graphics actually decent. I would play it if it didn't crash. Maybe they'll update it and it will work.Edit: Well, it finally works. Game play is a little bit boring, and the dragons are hard to manuver. The tutorial didn't really go into much detail. For a free game, I can't really complain. There are still some bugs, thoug. Now the game might just randomly freeze up.			"

												Such a waste of time... Being recently released ofc it has limited maps etc, that's not the issue. Nothing works. - The movement of your own dragon (yes, i've tried several) always seems to be half the speed of anyone elses- I never once figured out how to use my ""special ability"" regardless of what key I hit- The dragon moves (default Q and E keys) also don't seem to work- Spawn areas are not safe, and you can be killed through your own shield within seconds of spawning- Once you've mapped your key configuration there is NO way to edit it after the initial setup- Nothing is explained fully enough except the stats (cooldowns, energy, movement etc)- There's no training area so you're instantly thrown in against anyone and everyone before you know what to do- Levelling only seems to unlock more DNA fo you to create more dragons ( saw no stats change, no refill additions etc)- There seems to be no options for weapons, so everyone has the same thing It has potential but right now it's lacking a lot of content, requires a lot of fixes and the ability to actually edit settings beyond your audio, and desperately needs more information/hints/whatever to help anyone not looking for a limited 5min PVP game where you can die before you even fly.

												I played it earlier this year and it was the bomb. It was to me what Rocket League is to me now. Cool as ♥♥♥♥ and pretty fun... so RL server are down right now and I tried again. There's been a huge update, which also removed some of my dragons and all of my DNA. The game is still fun, but the interface is just impossible, I am so lost in it. It's messy and everything overlaps and there's no sense of direction. They also need some proper support for controller. Also seems they went the microtransaction way but in 5 minutes I got 2 skins, so that aint bad. I really wanted skins so I'm not bothered by that. Seems like the player base has dropped though, but timezones are strange so can't really say anything about that..			"

												This review updated Dec. 17.   It is now possible to get past the loading screen.  Make sure to create your dragon before trying to do the AI battle or the team battle.  If you see the loading screen for more than a few seconds when clicking the AI battle, something is not right, and waiting is useless.  This game is very fun, and very underrated - this seems to be due to some bugs in the past, that seem mostly fixed now.  The game is relatively simple, and depends on combat to keep it interesting - perfect for a casual gamer who does not want to wade through huge menus.  The dragons have good variability, (I tried two) with a choice of weapons, but not so many that you need a college course to analyse it.  The tuitorial is just enough to prepare you.  When entering the AI battle, there was a real person instead of AI.  He killed me easily about 6 times, chatting, as he did, and encouraging me to chat.  He would let me hit him just enough to think I might win, but no... (I am very average).   He finally slowed down and let me kill him, and then the game starts giving presents - Ha!...pretty nice.   The second AI battle had a bot dragon that was very well programed to hide, dart out, evade, and generally act similar to a real person (challenging).   The AI battle landscape is well designed with many places to hide and ambush.  Anyway...nothing but fun.			"

												This graphics are pretty and gameplay can be fun.  The player base is small though and you may spend whole death matches waiting for someone to join and winning by default.  When you do get into a match, there are groups who will work tgether in the non-team matches to overwhelm a single player.  The game is free so you have nothing to lose by giving it a try.			"
