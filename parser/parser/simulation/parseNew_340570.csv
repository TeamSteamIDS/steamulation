								Not much here....The artwork is great on the cards but the tutorial is the only thing close to complete. I love TCG and am happy to support any developer brave enough to attempt to make their own. However I can not recomend this game when I can say I am honestly this bored of playing it after twenty minutes. Needs improvement on pretty much every level. I think unfortunately they may have oversimplified the basic mechancs a bit too much in an attempt to target card players.The artwork is great and I give them points for trying something a bit different than the MTG, Infinity Wars, Might & Magic, Solforge, or Hex all of which I would recommend for a first time player over this. Even with the learning curve involved players will be rewarded with a deeper appreciation for the strategy and tactical awareness each has to offer. That's something I see missing from this game. I will be checking in hoping for some updates but for now I've got to give it the thumbs down. Points for trying to do something different and putting together a decent UI (not to be understated in how enjoyable a digital tcg experience can be) but overall this is just not quite worth your time or dollars unless your a tcg fanatic such as myself.2/10 (Early Access Review here's hoping it goes up) "

								Awful. No deckbuilding, just 5 cards in your hand that you play blindly and hope the other three players don't gang up on you. You just play the cards randomly and they go back to your hand for a cooldown. The cards don't interact with each other. They have no special abilities.What's the point?			"

								I've been playing MTG for 5 years and nothing will ever compare to that so never get your hopes up. This game is trying to stand out on it's own and it does just that. If you've ever played a TCG then you already know how to play this game. So far so good although I just finished the tutorial and checked out deck building. Give it a shot, help this game grow into what you want it to be with forum feedback. You will pay less in Alpha now than you will in full later. Already my first trading card is worth $1.00 on the market. Makin' money! I will update this when I play more.Update-ish: Well I played a bit more. So far there are two match variants: deathmatch and horde. Deathmatch is always 4 player unless online. You can attack anyone. Horde mode I do not understand. I'm pitted against one other and I can seemingly only use each card once during the fight then nothing happens until I quit the match... It happened twice. I just played Horde again and beat the first guy, then two more A.I. showed up and our health was reset and they killed me eventually. So this appears to be some kind of survival gametype.The lack of cards available and card variants so far makes this game kinda stale out of the box but that will change in due time. The cards you can choose from are Creature (oppressive), Witch (defensive), aaand that's it. Now, they do call a card type the ""Hero"", he adds a permanent boost to your playstyle depending on which one you choose like auto-healing every turn, taking one less damage from each attacker, and so on. The cards have a bit of synergy to them but are basically the same across elements (fire, water, air, earth). At one point myself and two A.I. kept healing and attacking and running out of stamina (mana) and this kept on forever until I had to quit because no winner was surfacing. There needs to be more card types similar to enchantments or something so the game can feel more suspenseful rather than predictable. In the end I think this game will evolve into a whole system rather than alpha-chunks but for now try it out, give them feedback, and help make a great digital card game.Monday, June 29th, 2015: Update: No work done on this and it's still stale, not worth it any more, it had promise.

								the art is wonderful to look at ill give the devs that but as far as a tcg game goes there really isent much to it maybe wait till this game gets more features but till then id stay away 1/10 tcg games are some of the best kind of pc games one can play becuse of there low spec requirements and intense gameplay...but when it comes down to this game it failed horribly at it			"

								I bought this game because of the art. Recommending it solely based on cool wolf illustrations. The time it took to illustrate is worth my three bucks for sure. Played the tutorial, gameplay seems pretty easy to pick up. :] I'm hoping that I'm the first person to have bought it on steam since it was just released this morning. Woo.Heck yeah wolves!!!!:D "

								The tutorial's minimal and very confusing, the game doesn't seem to have been updated since February 2015, the dev doesn't seem to have said anything since November 2015, and the game seriously overheats my high-end laptop worse than anything I've ever seen.			"
