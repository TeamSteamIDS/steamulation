												The one of the most undervalued games made by russian gamedev, in my opinion.Good story, stylish design, great music, big open world with own secrets.The game about Artificial Intelligence, enclosed in small indestructible ball, which controls a large battle machines, designed to exterminate all what it considers as enemy.But these robots doesnt want to kill all humans, it's too mainstream, moreover they would worship humans if they had them on their abandoned planet. But no one forbids them to fight each other. Or to trade. Or to be a courier.I strictly recommend you to also to play the first part of this game (AIM, 2004). In some aspects, it better than this part, better story, in particular. Sadly, we can't buy it on Steam.On the other side - this game is a bit buggy. But i hope, it will be fixed in future. "

												Creators had left this world leaving machines with a simple a.i. Most machines just followed his program - moving to perfection.  For this they fought and traded. These machines could not die, because after the destruction of their ""physical shell"" - glider, all accumulated information and ""computer center"" - mechanoid remained intact. And behold, one momet in this world of eternal war without death, world of eternal race for perfection came mechanoid which first began to think about something that is not a direct consequence of  initial program: what it is? who are the creators? for what they have left them on this planet and where gone?best expressed by one reviewer. ""AIM"" can be considered pioneers of genre ciberhippy on our computers, under the blue sky over the green meadows intelligent machines lead leisurely struggle for universal unity of reason. I'd like to see these machines have become happy.""will tell nothing more :)			"

Исправление проблемы с загрузкой обучения/сектора Скал 
A Guide for A.I.M.2 Clan Wars
By: kazemir

			This little fix corrects problem with TEX_L1_LAMP_CLIFF model. Because of this problem you can not pass the tutorial and enter the Rock sector.		


So happy as Larry I tried playing the game again. The problem is the missions get bugged out and often my ship refuses to move rendering me a sitting duck. Re-starting the game usually fixes it but sometimes you have to do it 2 or 3 times. I reckon it would be a good game if it was working properly but as it is I wouldn't recommend spending money on it no matter how cheap.			"

												A.I.M. was one of the best games I've ever played, however, I think this one needs a bit more. Still, great game. I strongly recommend to play the original game before even thinking of buying this one.So far, the only bug I've found happens when you enter the Destroyed Sector; game crashes. "

												Neither ""Recommending"" or ""Not recommending"" There's a distinction between a review and a recommendation and both of them shouldn't be mixed together. This is a review. Setting is fantastic, the spirit of sci-fi is strong in A.I.M. universe.But other than exploring the sectors, it's very tedious to actually play it after getting a hang of it. Interaction with enviroment is rather limited.There are many gliders and upgrades to pick from, but they must be grinded for. Gliders and their equipment in hangar can be sold at the same price they were bought for, making amount of money (energy crystals) a substitute for an ""experience bar"" that measures character's (mechminds) progress besides the ranking system. Controls are decent, and after getting certain add-ons and upgrading engine - it's really nice to actually glide over the sectors. Combat is fun around places with busy trafic but it never reaches a scale of war. Just random dogfights. AI isn't challenging either. Clan managment is rather limited (having two sliding bars for adjusting role ratio)  and having clan doesn't provide any actual benefit as it simply serves as a plot point / plot key. Recruiting clan members just reduces things to shoot at, eventually eliminating the only source of action there is in game.Side quests are mostly unmemorable (there are few that reveals interesting bits of lore). While trading has the same patern acros all sectors and it's satisfying overall, each structure still has to be visited seperatly while searching for good oportunity to profit before starting trading runs, since there's no remote way to monitor stock even in captured structures that belong to the clan and that's bothersome. Without presence of the player in the sector economy eventually colapses - AI traders can't sustain sector on their own.Graphics are fine.Localisation could've been done better.Had to disable music since it plays in loops due to some bug.Experienced movement bugs as well.Game crashes from time to time.

												Keeps crashing whenever there's a cutscene. I can't progress when I want to make a clan or travelling to a different sector. I play on the Windows 10 if that means anything.I also feel that both the interface quality and BGM were lacking compared to the first game imo.However I highly recommend the first A.I.M.

												An old game with dated graphics(as if that's an important thing), some annoying bugs, controls and mechanics difficult to learn at first, maybe some configuration files to modify to avoid crashes, and some other annoying or disappointing things.Then why my review is positive? It's simple, the awesomeness of this game smash everyone of its defects and make the game still worth buying(it even goes on sale quite often). I personally love this game even despite all of its defects, i'll never regret buying it and the previous chapter(A.I.M. Artificial Intellginet Machine) who is sadly not avaiable on Steam.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is an i have no idea game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere is many resolution sizes available.There is a music volume slidebar.There is a sound volume slidebar.There is a mouse sensitivity.There is a game difficulty.About the game.You are in a ship thingy and you have to kill enemies. But the scrolling to different angles are soo unbearable. You can't even play well. If you give it a small woop to the left, You are making a turn of 180 degrees and if you get shot by an enemy then your screen goes wonky too and then you can't even aim on him. Once i was dead and i was trying to play a new game again. The game crashes..You can choose your own style. Fly controls are literally unbearable.Game crashes.No steam cards..Other things.Not worth it.-------------------I Give this game a 1/10			"

												Another good idea, with almost nil reached potential. It has several game-breaking bugs that prevent continuation, and the general user interface and pace are so slow that you'll find yourself checking your watch to see how much longer you need to play, rather than how much longer you are able to play.

												Recommended to people who enjoy a little grinding every now and then. Because theres nothing better, than wasting all of your energy on a ship and then having to have almost no energy for repairs and thus being forced to return back a bit to grind some more crystals. As people say, it is buggy. Yes. But theres fixes to that in the guide section which works great. Owned the game on a CD from 1C but lost the CD and noticed it here, I dont regret buying it twice and unfortunately you can't buy the first one. Positive: A rather unique story line.A rather fragile (and hard to maintain) ecenomic system. A game with more than one way to pass it.Suiting music to the setting of the game, making the general atmosphere is pretty amazing. Customization of your glider lets you be just what you intend to be.The game can run on even the oldest of computers. (If you turn off steamoverlay to reduce the RAM usage)NegativesIt is ineeded bugged up, unfortunately the dev's didn't patch the game, but the are fixes to it. A rather hard start, being a loner is not easy in a field of war. Lack of explanation of the hotkeys, to know how to turn on some of the things you need to go to settings. Too short of a tutorial, it only covers up the basics of movement and control, but not of economy. Lack of tips.No open end. Unfortunately, once you finish the mainquest, the game ends and puts you in the main menu.Overal:To people who never played this series, recommended for a new experience. It will be a pretty unique game for them IF they're willing to fix some bugs by patching their game. If you dont want to bother fixing it, you'll miss out on a great game. I personally recomend this game and one of those who are still hoping about the third part. Try it if youre willing to deal with it, itll be a new experience.			"

												I love this game as much as any other game in my Library, the game loves me back too, thats kind of scary. Everytime I ""die"" in the game, I get a crash to desktop- no matter when or where, I have to shutdown system and restart. I feel the game controls fluidly and floaty, that is excellent for hovership or Gliders, thats what the game calls them. You are in control, much like Mechwarrior. There are resources to manage such as energy, health, ammo that recharge over time and can be relegated to specific ship functions. So I thought a game about Artificial Intelligences conversing and socializing with each other is quite weird in itself and it is. The story is undeniably quirky and lacking human feeling because there are no humans. How hard could it be to try and bridge the gap between fighting mech clans and unite them together for the sake of theirs and the entire worlds fate. Well the AI has its own AI, you see. Missions are granted at bases, most that I saw were standard fetch, delivery, terminate etc. There are game progression missions too, but sorting these from the rest is difficult and it should be so for immersion sake. Every mission changes the world, whether it be the economy which is always fluctuating, you can buy and sell as a trader or defeating that tough mech that would allow you access to futher reaches of the zone, not to mention resolving parts of the story. It is a mystery too and quite intriguing in the respect that you do not have to worry about certain natural  dialogue occuring. You are unravelling this world and learning to understand how mechminds compute. It is all quite innocent and brutal at the same time. I will bet most refunds come from the tutorial. The glider they give you is atrocious. You will see if you play, luckily its only 5 minutes before you get right down and comfortable in a much better quality glider. Then the game takes off. I don't know if it would be so bad if there was voice acting. I think the environment would be fantastic if they had off kilter computer like voices, it would open up so much, but there is a ton of reading. Thankfully There is a ton of action and most is up to the player if they want to partake.  In finality this review is coming to an end. Beware this game is probably more than you asked for. If you believe in overcoming near impossible odds in an open world very foreign and very familiar GET THIS GAME and tell others. The Gliders are all upgradeable many times over, alot for style. Just don't try and read my mind after you play it, there may be a ghost in this machine.Unfortunately, the game is broken and I cannot continue the main quest. The CTD are too frequent and uncontrollable to recomend. If you are lucky enough to not have this problem, then I envy you.			"
