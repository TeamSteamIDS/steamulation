												I was given a pre-release key for this game to see if everything was fine before being released on the store, and as there may be alot of people out there looking at this game (First day launches tend to be... viewed alot) I decided to do a review of my first 30 minutes. DON'T WANT TO READ? Here it is:Too expensive for its quality, weird for a game that beat KickStarter (1.6k) to have default textures everywhere. If it was cheaper, then I would recommend it.About it It's a 2D Game made on RPG Maker about a guy that is deep in debt and depression and with a very boring job.You will fix your problems (most of them with money) through RPGly battles and adventures through the game's map.The game tends to break the 4th Wall quite often (Maids knowing they don't do anything or that they look all the same and character in-game talking about Nintendo and grinding gold on WoW - although the latter doesn't seems to be 4th wall, but I found it worth mentioning.) Features You will walk around in some confusing maze-dungeon-trap with random spawning monsters coming out of thin air all the time, fight them and proceed to walk for more 15s before getting into fight again (Like Cthulhu Saves The World, but in lesser quality)There are chests around the mazes, and most monsters are incredibly powerful, taking a bit of a time to deal with them (Job Police), that will have some special items such as Job sheets or Self-esteem spells.  Pros +1 It's nice fighting your problems as RPG.+1 Takes a while to finish, although that may be related to confusing mazes other than tons of content.+1 Beat a boss, win a promotion (That's as far as I got into the game, though!)+1 The main menu's background is cool. Cons -1 The entire game is made with standard (aka default) textures that come with RPG Maker, weird for a game that beat Kickstarter ($1.6k)-1 It doesn't even look like it has custom (aka community made or selfmade) scripts.-1 Game's OST doesn't seem to fit the game, looks like RTP (RPG Maker Default Material) OST-1 The game's price is.. too high. I mean, $9.99 for a RPG Maker game with no custom textures (EYE CANDY11!)-1 Most characters' dialogues are boring and dull.Sigh.. I hate when I have to do this. Rate a game negatively, but it happens.I don't recommend you buying this game for $9.99, but $4.99 or $3.99 would do it. "

												I actually really liked this game's concept of combining finance management with a traditional RPG.  It's a clever and unique idea I haven't really seen done like this before.Too bad it's ABSOLUTELY INFURIATING to play.  Nothing is explained.  There is no direction.  You will never figure out what the hell anything does. What is this status effect?  What am I getting hit with?  How am I supposed to block it?  What does this spell/item/menu/building/area/character/monster/boss/effect/investment/weapon/armor/accessory/insert-any-gameplay-element-can-think-of-here do?  You'll spend the whole time asking yourself these questions, and unfortunately you're the only one who's ever heard of this game before so you're not exactly going to find the Prima strategy guide for it.  I would describe the gameplay best as ""wander aimlessly until you find the one path where monsters don't one-hit kill you, reconfigure and redo battles until you randomly find a configuration that let's you not get irredeemably reamed,"" When you're ready to finish the game, go to bed over and over so the main plot devices just resolve themselves.  Either that or you can go fight the last boss.  Because he's there.  And because stabbing him makes credits roll.  I guess that's reason enough.Also there is a horrible hole under a tower with a knight that casts death (I guess?) on every single party member up to eight times every single round.  There's no indication what's actually happening and I've found no combination of gear that gives you any defense against it.  All I know is there's a 100% chance that knight will slap seven shades of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you at any level.  So have fun with that nightmare.This was supposed to be leisure time; WHY AM I SO ANGRY?!

												Where did the Kickstarter money go!? This game made a lot of money on Kickstarter and is 99% default RPG maker! $10 for a game that should be free, I paid $1 for this and I feel cheated. For the people that left positve reviews you can play hundreds of FREE games on ANY rpg maker site that will have more work put into it. This games doesn't even use the FREE fullscrene  window script, you play this in a small window, I see mapping that a 12 year old could do better, I see map errors, the amout of custom work in the game costs no more then $40 and the Kickstarter raised $1,599.... These people actually just paid off this guys credit card bill....You can spend $10 on this game or 5 clicks to...1 click on web and put in rpg maker site2 click on game fourms 3 click on a random game topic4 click the download button5 click to install I just saved you $10....the dev should be ashamed of themselves...

												This game has the potential to be a huge indie hit if it had a little more love put into it.  RPGs live or die on their writing and this one has both clever writing and a quirky, engaging premise. Unfortunately that's been wrapped up in stock RPG Maker graphics and music.  More originality in those areas would go a very long way.  As it is, the game seems very much worth playing, as it definitely entertains.  I'd recommend it at the less than a dollar sale price point.As for the people complaining about where the Kickstarter money went.... The guy didn't even make enough to pay my rent for a month and clearly detailed where it all went, including paying a couple of people for some original assets. It still wasn't dven enough to compensate for the creative work he had done if he had kept it all. It can clearly be seen itemized out on his Kickstarter page. Does Cubicle Quest need work? Yes.  Does it detract from the game? No.Is it still fun? Yes.  "

COOL! 8.5/10The concept of this game is very good. You are playing as Bob, a guy that tries to pay all his debts and solves all his problems in a blurry fantasy world. In this game you'll fight your debts with soldiers (actually it's money), and also fight your personal problems with swords, magic, and things. It's really cool, especially the life lessons.Somehow this game teaches me more about life. As it said in the store page, it's a game about how life can suck. Dead end jobs, repetitive obligations, irritating coworkers, and also about love. In this game, you'll find that the girl that you love is actually asexual and rejected you no matter how much you tried to marry her. You'll find that it's actually good to marry someone that loves you who you are. Yeah, there are a lot of life lessons that you can get by playing this game.Finally, I recommend you to play this game. And thanks to my friend that bought this game for me.			"

												Cubicle Quest, gameplay-wise, is a standard JRPG with turn-based combat, the likes of which RPG Maker VX Ace is designed for. It follows the story of a man named...well...whatever you want to name him (let's go with Pantsinestro). Pantsinestro is neck-deep in debt, and it's your job to get him out of it.This is where the game differs itself in terms of actual gameplay--monsters don't drop gold, so your only way to get money is to get promotions and cut down on spending...or, in gameplay terms, go through dungeons and fight the bosses within to prove yourself worthy of getting a higher pay. You advance the months by going to bed, which gives you your monthly income and restores your HP and MP, but it also piles more debt on you, since those loans have interest rates attached to them. Since there is no way to recover your HP and MP for free besides advancing the months, this creates an interesting ticking-clock element where you have to make the most of each month, leveling up and getting more income as efficiently as possible without wearing yourself down (or spending too much money on healing items).The thing most people seem to complain about is the art and music. Yes, the game uses the default RPG Maker graphics and sound, but to be honest, it doesn't hamper the game all that much. It's annoying, but the gameplay and humor shine through enough to make the annoyance of default assets practically irrelevant.Speaking of the humor, it may or may not be your cup of tea, but I like it. It's almost Earthbound-esque, if Earthbound broke the fourth wall even more often. The characters often question game mechanics and point out things that only make sense in games (like the ""NPC Racist"" maid in the trailer), and while I'm usually a fan of the fourth wall staying just how it is, it managed to get a few laughs out of me.Of course, this game isn't perfect. There are some annoying balance issues, especially with some enemies in a dungeon being far more powerful than others in the same dungeon. The game recommends you save often in different files, and I wholeheartedly agree--death can come from the most unexpected of places. One example of this is near the beginning of the game, in the first dungeon. The random encounters I'd faced up to that point were mostly fine, except for one enemy (Idle Whim, I think. It looks like a spider) who dealt frankly absurd damage compared to his allies, but one of my random encounters was against an enemy who appeared fairly normal at first. His attacks did trivial damage, but he had more health than the others in the dungeon, so we traded blows for a while. Suddenly, a couple turns before I would've killed him, he performed a massive attack that did more damage than my entire HP capacity at that point. The attack wasn't telegraphed, it wasn't forewarned, it just happened and killed me. So, like I said, save, or else you might be killed by some random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. (I should note that I only saw this guy once--I never encountered him again, even traveling across the same square, so it's possible you won't have to deal with him. Just be forewarned--if you're in the first dungeon and you encounter a massive knight, RUN!)TL;DR: it's funny, charming, and has a unique financial system. Don't dismiss it from the graphics alone. Yes, there are some balance issues and the price tag is a *bit* high, but I completely recommend it if it's on sale. Even if it isn't, I recommend it...just, y'know, less so.			"

  Introduction            	Cubical Quest is an old school RPG that was funded through Kickstarter. The game plays just like an old RPG like final fantasy (reminds me of the turnbased combat and world exploration), and , but the art style does seem generic. The story of Cubical Quest is a huge joke on everyday life. A few examples of this are: Your party members are called roommates, the enemies have ironic names (Trivial Relationship, Fear of intimacy), beating a boss gives you a “promotion”, and the big bad is the Debt Alliance. The game even is self-aware and references real life things. Ex: “To comply with Nintendo censorship standards, I am required to say the substance in the bottles behind me is juice.” And “Hello there, cliché RPG child running in circles.” Cubical Quest isn’t innovative, but the comedy/jokes/self-references make this game very entertaining. The huge issue for me is all of the sprites seem very generic and out of place. (Fear of Intimacy is a green bat gargoyle thing)      Pros                Self-aware jokes Typical fun old school RPG gameplay  Great comedy Unique items/upgrades Everything references real life problems (self-esteem, paperwork, and whine) Comedic look at the “everyday” life in the form of an old RPG    Cons               Generic sprites Not many graphic options No voice acting     Conclusion                 	Cubical Quest is an old school RPG that creates a unique comedic look at everyday life. The game’s assets do seem generic, but the funny dialogue and good old RPG gameplay make up for the generic seeming assets. If you are a fan of the old RPG games, this is definitely a game you should pick up.-HiPFiRED If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupCheck out the Original Network Groups.

												An interesting game about a person dealing with DEBT. It treats real life situations like a rpg game. There are even side bosses and side quests to complete..Some of the late game bosses are a bit overpowered, but with the right strategy, they can be beaten.This whole idea is a fresh new look at a job with rpg aspects.I recommend this game just for it's uniqueness and how it takes a fresh spin on RPG games.

												Don't buy it for 10$ but while it's on the 1$ special [just this week it looks like as of 8/30/2015], definitely get it.It's entertaining, funny, and oddly inspirational.I definitely share the sentiments of the other reviewers and discussion board posters that are appalled by this game using almost entirely exclusively non-original and RPG maker's sprites, artwork, and even music. And the game also got 1600$ from kickstarter. Speaking of oddly inspirational... that comes to mind.It's not a bad game itself, I'm enjoying it a lot.I think it's rather a great game.If you see it on sale for 3$ or less then you should maybe get it, but with the huge lack of creative artwork content and music [a big one], it's not worth 10$.The game itself though, bland aesthetics, disappointment bias about the kickstarter, and music aside, is pretty cool. Just not $10 cool.			"

My playtime: 23:30:28 (based on in-game clock).Developer Response: Never.IntroCubicle Quest is a turn based RPG Maker game which combines itself with real life concepts. You just graduated from college with tons of debt, mainly college loan, and you'll have to do anything to pay them off and succeed in life. You can get married, fight tons of internal and external conflicts which are wrapped as monsters, and so on. This game reminds me with Harvest Moon with its non linear timeline in real life setting.MusicsMost (if not all) of this game's musics are using default assets. Some musics are not appropriate although most of them are okay. The music is forgettable though. This is probably because of the default assets.GraphicsSimilar to the musics, most (if not all) of this game's graphics are using default assets. The town mappings are quite bland with houses placed everywhere and the dungeon designs are just okay. The dungeons itself are quite short and some of them has puzzles, although it's quite easy and not that interesting.There is also an overlapping enemies in Key of the Soul. If there are two big sized enemies, one of them will have their face covered with the others.StoryThere isn't much story to the game except for how our MC pay the debt and kill the last boss. However, there are lack of informations in the game; There is a sign with no text in Port Nostalgia, Boss Complacency and Hedonic Treadmill which has their dialogue swapped, and an equipment, ""Me, Myself, and I"", which isn't written that it has counterattack chance although it does.The gameFirst of all, there are 9 playable characters although you can only choose 3 person (the MC is a must have) as your party members. They will join your party after you either help or talk to them. Although you can't raise your party member's stats, their stats will be increased automatically each levels which will help them determine their role. Some party members are healers, and some are dps. Because the non active party member will receive half exp from battle, you can switch some party members if you're not quite satisfied with them.Each character has its own skills. Although there are a lot of party members, their skills distribution are unbalanced. Most bosses weak against personal attacks and most multi damaging skills (the strongest type) are personal type. Party healing skill can only be learned by the glass cannon (Alayna) and there is even a party member which has 2 skills which can only be used outside the battle with a high MP cost despite of its weak skill effect (Gina).Speaking of attack types, this game has different elements from your usual RPG. This game introduces 4 main elements: personal, work, human, and mental. The only way to know the enemy type is by attacking them with each skill type. However, mental element is divided into several other elements such as stress, depression, and delusion and each of them have their own skill weaknesses which make them looks like a separate element although it can be reduced easily with equipments. The status effects are also spelled differently from normal RPG. However, if you play a lot of RPG Maker games, you'll know what they do based on their symbol.The equipments are also spelled differently in this game. ""Goal"" is your weapon, ""Community"" is your armor, and ""Virtue"" is your shield. The shield mostly is used either to reduce damage from various mental element damage or status resist (not nullify). There is also a book which can give you passive and active boost. You'll receive the active boost when you're equipping the book while you'll receive the passive boost after you gather enough BP which can be obtained by killing enemies. Although that there are a lot of statuses which can be obtained from the books, you can't see all of your party member's status (such as eva and special eva). Lastly, there is also an accessory which can give additional status boost.In this game, you'll mostly explore short dungeons and defeat their bosses in the end. Although the dungeons are short, they have high damaging enemies which can drain your MP quickly. Because there is no way to restore MP in dungeon except by using MP restoring items, you have to finish the dungeon quickly (you even have to save and load often) and the short dungeon works in our favor. However, some bosses in the game have an unforgiving one hit ko skill (for single and all party members) which have like 50% chance of succeeding.Pros:- 9 playable characters- Marriage- Lots of dungeons to explore- Learnable stat boost (books)Cons:- Unbalanced party members- Unusual and nonsensical element type (mental elements)- Enemies are quite strong (and drain tons of MP to beat)ConclusionThis is a RPG maker game with real life theme. The game is not linear and you can do whatever you want. You'll need to save and load most of the time to finish a dungeon if you're not over leveled in the said dungeon.Should you buy this game?Yes.Imo, a game like this is quite rare to find. This can be a great game to refresh your mind when you're bored with mainstream RPG maker games. However, you'll have to be prepared to save and load a lot. Buy this when it's on sale (don't buy it for a full price) and that's it. "

												Spoiler: This game is fun as hell.Cubicle Quest is a fantastic RPG that simulates the state of American college-age adults who have found themselves wrapped in debt in their attempts to integrate into society as new blood of the system. Student loans, the encroaching horror of a fate spent at a dead-end job, and the difficulties of asserting independence plague you, the adventurer.I don't mean to sound ethnocentric, but I believe that someone not native to the US and who hasn't lived in the country or has any friends to correspond with will find this game bizarre-turned-horrifying upon realizing that this game perfectly emulates the reality for millions of Americans (minus the monster-fighting, of course) especially from cultures like Western Europe's that have indoctrinated their citizens into a system that places important emphasis on education without requiring one to sell their soul in order to pay off loans and debt. I recall that my French Professor who teaches literature frequently expresses her lividity towards us Americans who need to work five jobs and downscale our diets to eating♥♥♥♥♥♥(newsflash: Ramen is ♥♥♥♥ing bad for you) in order to make meager dents into our student debts. Enough politics and cultural comparisons, though.This game is real life. In fact, I think it would do all prospective college-bound adults and those already in college to give this game a try. For those who are afraid of the horror stories that people tell you about debt and obligations and the juggling of responsibilities, this will put a face on such abstract concepts. It will still be harrowing, but at least the metaphor will serve you better than no mental image at all.For us currently-enrolled students, this will be a fun and painfully true experience of where we currently are in life while offering laughs, parodies, and dare I say it, hope. Superficial hope--I mean, beating virutal monsters and waving your Book of Diet isn't going to really help you in the real world--but at least it gives you the confidence that if you square yourself off against each ""foe"" you'll be able to truck through, hopefully.Just know that despite how difficult the time period of your life is that this game captures, you have support of your professors, teachers, parents (hopefully), and even more hopefully, colleagues that know what the ♥♥♥♥ they're talking about. It is overwhelming to be sure, but it's all about tackling each goal step-by-step.Enough pep talk. Play this game. If not for the RPG elements then for the RPG style that analogizes real life. Freaking fun, this game is. "

Cubicle Quest is an rpg where your life becomes fantasy!The plot of the story is good but somehow it feels like it wasn't original. (even the names of some stuff.)The game got LOTS of humor!

No new story, no new dialogue. You've paid off your debt, married, got a house, been promoted to the top. Everything is pretty much figured out. Only a couple of dungeons/bosses remain. However, the remaining monsters and bosses are ridiculously powerful, yet you have no way to deal with this. There is no more equipment to be scavenged, there is nothing to spend your money on.

												This could be just another RPG maker boring game but it really did have some bonus to it.Your a random 25-year-old just-graduated newly-employed guy having serious financial problems: low pay job, college loan, credit cards bills, and so on. There is no specific mission or anything. You just need to try and be financially successful and for that you must face monsters that represent all the problems a guy like that would have (like 4 hours pointless meetings, relationship problems, spending too much on gadgets...). The sense of humour and the way the game makes fun of rpg cliches is a great reason to give it a try. If you get some discount try it out for some laugh at how it really represents well things in life.Only bad thing is not being able to turn off the music...			"

												Nice! Some fights are very hard though, and the game doesn't really help you in finding out where to go, so there's a lot of try and error and running into mobs which are still way too strong (and unlike the tutorial said, you will die often).			"

												I'm someone who loves old fashioned JRPGs, but has gotten really bored with a lot of the RPG maker games on Steam.  I *really* like this game.  It's not without flaws, but a very fun experience.  The question you have to ask yourself is ""am I okay with a game that is a big self-referential allegory?""  You arm yourself with goals, and armor yourself with a community of friends.  Enemies are life challenges.  In this game you will fight a succubus sprite labeled as ""empty relationship"", you will arm yourself with your goal of ""read more books"", and defend yourself with ""drinking buddies"".  if this bothers you, this is not the game for you.Short version: 8.5/10 strongly recommend to anyone who likes turn based JRPGs, and wasn't completely turned of by the premise.Interestingly many of the games strengths are also its weaknesses:Pros/Cons:+ The battle system is interesting, but manages to not be as tedious as a lot of games that add extra random battles to pad game length.  Characters are largely not customizable, but the fact that you get a fairly large number means your party *is*.  Skills are varried enough that you have meaningful decisions in combat.- As with any turn-based JRPG type game, sometimes you're just hitting ""attack"" very quickly to kill weak enemies.-The game's allegorical nature sometimes makes things confusing.  I never had problems in other games making the connection that ""lava breath"" was a fire attack, but with attack types like ""stress"" and ""laziness"" it can sometimes be hard to pick out what attacks are doing, and the game isn't terrible forthcoming with the information+ Music and sound is pretty generic, but very enjoyable.  I often mute games and play music, but I didn't for this one+ I rather like the story, but I could see some people just not really ""getting"" it+ A fun collection of characters to meet.- All the characters are pretty one dimensional.  Making friends, offering emotional support, and forming relationships are all core concepts to this game, so I feel like it could have used some more robust characters.  This isn't mass effect/Lornen/Dragon age+ A surprisingly open world (gated somewhat like a metroidvania), that lets you figure out where you want to go and what you want to do.- Sometimes it's very hard to figure out what to do.  For instance when you start the game you're in debt, and you need to find a room mate and get a promotion at work.  What the game doesn't tell you is that the dungeon of promotion is basically impossible with a 1-man party, so you need to do them specifically in the room mate-> promotion order, unless you spend an hour or two grinding on the world map- There's also one or two areas I had trouble accessing.  Fortunately since the game is so open I didn't *need* to get into them, but it was still frustrating. "

												Is funny, at first. After a few hours just grinding. The concept is the best of this game. Is like someone day dreaming at work about solving his common problems in a fantasy, swords and magic way. Cool.But, at the end, very generic, run-of-the-mill RPG. Anyway, if you're up to that, give it a try. I'm neutral about this game, so I recommend but just to fans of the genre. And, also, includes cards and is very very cheap. So either look for a badge or sell the cards and the game will be basically free.			"

												This game is like someone ripped what I wanted right out of my subconscious and dropped it into RPG Maker. It's clever, it's unique, it's insightful, and it's fun to play. At no point have I felt like I needed to grind for something.The game only explains the basic mechanics, but that's really enough to get started on while you figure the rest out on your own. Which really just extends on the game's central conceit of gamifying the challenges of young adulthood.The combat balance is good. It's hard enough that you have to learn the system and fill out a full roster of useful characters, but at the same time I have yet to feel stuck or that something was unreasonably hard (except the things that are supposed to be).An interesting bit that I did not realize early in the game is that every combat item that is available for sale is available and reasonably affordable from the very beginning. Once again showing how deeply thought out the metaphors of this game are, everything worth having in the game you have to work for.			"

												Humorous, and could be therapeutic to the right kind of nerd.  Mundane obligations threaten to overwhelm the main character at the start of the game, but they can conquer true hardship by the end.  RPG gameplay is stock retro, but the game balance is unusually good for an RPG of this type.  Playing strategically matters more than grinding (most of the time).  The world is also open enough to frequently give multiple choices to one's next action.  You can even occasionally sneak ahead into dungeons over your level in order to extract an item that empowers you significantly in the dungeons appropriate to your level.That said, the author seems to lose faith at some points, and there's no point in finishing this game.  Play while you enjoy the gameplay, if you enjoy the gameplay, and restart whenever the urge to replay early content strikes you.  The quality of this product is hindered by the antipathy of the author towards their audience; the story craps out entirely into lame deconstructionism at the end.PS:  The Dungeon of Advertising is hilariously OP when you get access to it.  Beware the wailing siren soundtrack!  I had some fun dipping into it at lower levels to slash apart its weaker denizens for inflated EXP rewards, but I learned to run away from the Shopping Addiction.  The Shopping Addiction seems to be the most powerful enemy in the entire game (not counting bosses).  I'm sure this says something about the author's biases, but I'm not sure what.			"

												The game creators really went creative about the concept of this game. You basically start out in your apartment and you end up in a sort of dream state where you beat the dept armies RPG style. It is really ironic because when I bought this game we were talking about after college debts in the UK/US in class. They really took everthing RPG style which is kind of funny. The humor in this game is also appropriate for the matter.The music is something I would like to ellaborate in this game. Overall it is pretty loud, most game music I can listen to at 100% sound but this music is even loud at 50%. Not that it is bad, it is pretty good, but I don't want to wear hearing aid 5 years from now. The battle music is catchy and I find it enjoying when I listen to it. The boss music is even better, I really felt the tension while I was playing these boss battles.The gameplay is doubtful, although fun and challenging, it is easily to get screwed up and being stuck in a dungeon and then not being able to get out. There is a sort of planned out order of events and if you do not follow these you get screwed by the game, there is one 'strategy' to prevent this from happening and that is being overleveled most of the game. The dungeons itself are very challenging but the save option helps you a lot getting through because most of the battles require you to try over and over. That is because there is a certain rng in this game, while in battle you notice if you can handle this battle/boss or not but you can still lose due to the order of moves/specials they use. If the luck is in your favor you can beat them eventhough you used the same/similar strategy as the previous battle which you lost. Some bosses are incredibly hard and require you to have a certain level/ certain skills to be able to beat them which is good, it asks you to grind a little bit instead of stomping the game effortless. Funny enough some battles are definitly lost but that is due to the story line, don't worry you won't lose anything (aside from your time).Overall a good game, good graphics and a good map. Although it is not clear where to go at all times it is fun to explore the map and find out. It is a pity though that you can't get out of dungeons if you 'screwed' up your path. Also you can't play this game fullscreen but that maybe prevents it crashing when tabbing out so that's not really a disadvantage.			"

												I just post a review to vote this game up because I feel it doesnt deserve that many negative votes, but while I'm here I'll try to give something.PROS:- it's pretty funny- the metaphorical part of this game is huge and it really cuts deep .- it doesnt take itself very seriously (could it anyways ?)- tons of 4th wall breaking moments, and I LOVE it.CONS:- although the fighting system is a pretty big part of the game, its balance is really weird and unpolished. (example, you can get a negative status that makes your char unable to attack for the next turns, if you heal this status the monster might just throw the same attack the next turn and put the status back again immediately, if the game was more polished, healing a status would make you immune to said status for at least a turn in order to avoid that kind of spam.... that being said, it's pretty insignificant.)In the end, it's a low price RPG maker game, sounds terrible right ?Yet it's awesome			"

												It's a cool game, but if even AAA titles can't get away with forcing your character to be normative, releasing this into the indie community is at the very least serious lack of planning. The mechanics are interesting, but the power plateaus are too far apart and there's no dynamic movement between them. You are either close to one shotting a monster or to being one shotted by it. It's a very creative twist to the RPG theme, but it lacks in planning.###SPOILERS AHEAD - IF YOU WISH TO AVOID THEM, SKIP THIS NEXT PARAGRAPH: to access the final area of the game, you have to get married, but you can only choose to marry one of the straight girls that accompany you simply because you are the main character. You are also told, at the beginning of the game, ""you better not be into dudes!"" by the first character you add to your party. In a game that is as closely linked to real world experiences, saying 'you can only be a straight male character (we can also assume cisgendered)' is kind of a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥move. Stardew Valley was made by only one programmer and it has a lot more diversity to it. END OF SPOILERS###			"

												Bigger ""review"" pending.I like the idea of the game.  I like putting a real-world personality spin on a fantasy world.  I can relate to the character, and I really wish I could go into a fantasy world to deal with MY issues.That being said, I don't think I'd recommend this...  While I like the style and don't mind a RPG Maker user using default or ""generic"" layouts, the combat system needs work.  I'm a total wuss.  While I have so many hours put into Dark Souls, I'm told there's a payoff if I ever beat it.  Here, I feel overwhelmed by the very first enemies I face (is that the point?) and die every time.  I enjoy a game where I can work a little in the beginning and then dominate.  In Pokémon Blue/Red, I trained my teams to Lv.56 before receiving my third badge...  I'm a spoiled wuss.I want to keep trying, though, so that's a plus.			"

												Ah, Cubicle Quest. A game that, despite it's plain exterior, has been an obsession of mine for the last while. Will it be yours?First off, ignore the negative reviews. They mostly make referenced to one of two things; first, the fact this game uses generic RPGMaker assets, which honestly doesn't really matter since the built in assets are there for a reason. Does every RPGMaker game need to have customized assets? Nope. Anyway, the second complaint is that things in the game are poorly explained. Well, in the area called ""Castle Sanity"" where you start the game and spend a great deal of time in, there is a staircase that leads to a basement with references on all of the mechanics of the game. So yeah, not really a complain when everything is right there.Now then, why is this game great and why would it be an obsession? Honestly it comes from the theme. It is laid out as a traditional fantasy RPG, but the skin on it reflects, well, any of us really. Your protagonist Bob (or whatever you decide to call him) decides to leave the safety of Mom'n'Pop Kingdom (he moves out on his own) and forms the Kingdom of Bob (gets his own place). Your job is to guide him through the process of defeating the Debt Alliance, consisting of the First & Second Credit Card Legions along with the College Loan Army (pay off all your debt). You do this by sending your soldiers to defeat enemy soldiers (pay your bills dammit!) You also go the Dungeon of Work and enter the Promotion Dungeon (get promoted at work and get paid more), enter your basement and defeat monsters representing your various expenses like food, hydro, etc (quit spending so much!) and even recruit a roomate to split your rent (acquire your first party member). Oh, and of course marry and buy a house (or not, as there are a lot of options in the game)This theme proceeds throughout the whole game and it's wonderful. While appearing as generic monsters, you battle against things like fear of commitment, facebook comparisons, false hopes, depression, panic, broken utilities, etc. Your boss battles are against things such as the Spectre of Loneliness, The Road Less Travelled, Fear of Change, True Hardship, etc. Eventually once you get your bills paid off, you're confronted by everyone's greatest fear; an empty life. The physical representation of just working for years at a job you're not happy with; of just working all the time and not really living. Once you conquer that, there's some post game content to deal with. All in all, I've put in 24 hours of time into the game and I've completed about 98% of the game, with a couple of the brutal post game bosses being too much for me to handle. As said earlier, the game has generic sprites, portraits, music, etc, but it is done very well to the point where the actual gameplay overshadows the graphical part. With a total of 8 recruitable party members, several candidates for marriage, multiple dungeons and bosses, and the fact that the game is very open ended after you get your first promotion, there's a lot to like here. I highly recommend this game as it helped me out personally by making me chuckle at some of life's difficulties, and I think it'll do the same for you.			"

												Battle system balance is completely unexplained and makes playing it very difficult because of the ""untraditional"" effects and elements. The game is about gaining money in a realistic fashion, but the economy can quickly be broken by making sandwiches and selling them for more money than the ingredients are worth.			"

												Jewel Quest uses the classic / generic template graphics of D RPG Maker xp system and use them in clever fashion. pretty much it plays like a JRPG but it's a metaphor for an average person's life which is brilliant! my only real complaint game is that it's not clear at times what items equipment works best which what foes. my only request if you ever up states the game is just to make a chart of elements. sorry for any grammatical errors I'm doing this on my phone and it's fighting me every bit of the way!

												I honestly tried to play the game but it becomes unbearable very quickly. Enemies are savagely overpowered with attacks that kill you in one hit, the enemies are also inconsistant with one lvl 3 enemy appearing after a group of five lvl 7s ? I spent atleast an hour just wandering with my party and fighting random enemies to try to level my party up but the game is super tight with XP. When I did reach a decent level I fought the 'boss' (a promotion) who immediately killed every member of my party with the first special attack....so back to wandering around trying to fight a game that feels like its preventing you from actually progressing. After three hours of levelling up I managed to fight the 'boss' again and won....yay. But now I have to start the process again as that lead to around 7 new 'boss'/quest fights appearing in game, all of whom I cant fight without being wiped out in seconds. Thats when I gave up, wandering the same part of the map while fighitng the same enemies bored the crap out of me and the whole story of how the game was made (Kickstarter for $1000+ that ends with a RPG Maker templated game) makes it worse. This game cost me 29p in the sale....it was too much!			"

												Outside of the concept there really isn't much in this game, poor characterization, thin plot, confusing combat all serve to make this difficult to get through.

												This game is a funny, fresh take on the traditional RPG adventure games from my yourh.  It reminds me of Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy with a touch of the ol' Sierra-style satirical humor.  I bought it on a recommendation of a friend, and I am so glad that I listened to him.  It is certainly worth checking out if you like a light-hearted RPG fun experience.			"

												This game has the potential to be a lot of fun but right now there is a big thing preventing me from enjoying it. It seems after a certain amount of hits in a fight, it says MISS after every attack. I don't know why it does this but it makes attempting to defeat a boss or even regular enemies almost impossible. I really like the idea of this game and messing around in it is fun but until it's possible to actually defeat an enemy, I'll have to recommend against this game.			"

												You play Bob, the most generic name ever, probably so you can easily project yourself onto him. You are a recent college graduate with a ton of credit card debt and college loans. As a recent graduate myself, I can vouch for having a ton of college loan debt, but credit card debt? I've never had more than $300 put onto credit. I'd like to think my experience is the norm. Otherwise - hooo boy. Credit Card companies must be making bank. The entire theme of the game has to do with life after school. You're kicked out of the home of your parents; which, being honest with you, I don't think is terribly likely. Most of my friends are about to hit their mid-twenties and they're still with their parents. Playing Bob, you advance your way through your career, your social life, life's many problems, and eventually conquer ""Empty Life"" - the final boss. The story isn't terribly inspired. If anything, it's pretty much real life struggle. Finding a job, dealing with other people in your life, and dealing with real-world problems like depression. Most of the dialogue in the game is tongue-in-cheek fourth-wall breaking banter. Which, as I am sorry to disappoint you in saying this, does not make it any less cliche. It's amusing to read, but then again I also laughed at Tyrion's joke about a Stark, a Tyrell, and a Lannister entering a bar. My sense of humour is probably not the best to go by. Long story short - it's a JRPG that's aware of itself being a JRPG. Which doesn't make it any better.Can we talk about JRPGs? Let's talk about JRPGs. JRPG has to be the type of game I like least, or it's waaaaaay up there. Why? Because JRPGs are long. Because JRPGs more often than not include grinding. They include memorizing enemy types (which we'll get to in a minute). They include all of this bananas stuff. I don't like the idea of levels, wherein you lose because you quoted bigger numbers at the other person. This is why I often praise Dark Souls. While levels can help, most of Dark Souls is about resource management and positioning. Very little of it is about how long you spend in the Darkroot Forest grinding Cat Covenant members. In a JRPG, you can be the best micro-manager of resources possible but still lose because you took on a Level 15 boss with your Level 2 party. It's a playstyle which promotes time investment of fighting mooks just so you can fight the boss. I just don't like that sort of thing. My biggest gripe with this game is enemy types. As near as I can tell, there are three enemy types (possibly four). Those are Work, Personal, and Human (and possibly Illusion). There are a series of skills on each your party members which can be effective against any of these types of monsters. The problem is, you have no way of telling what type of monster it is by looking at it. So you spend half the fight guessing which type is super effective until you find it and then you have to memorize it for future battles. Suppose you leave and fight other stuff in another area of the game. Fighting this other stuff is pretty rough, so you decide to grind back in the original area. Now you have to try to remember what type of enemies these were. It's madness! It's bonkers! This is not what I call fun! Every item in the game, every piece of equipment is related to real life but effectively it's a Find/Replace of your typical JRPG. Instead of 'weapon' you have 'goals'. Instead of 'armour' you have 'community'. It's not terribly interesting and it doesn't add anything to the genre. You don't get points in the game's favour just because you know what a Find/Replace function does. I mean, it's amusing for the first two seconds but when you realize what has been done, the chuckle dies down inside and you slowly come to terms with your depressing life, unemployment, and lack of ambition.... what was I saying again?The game presses out three things that fulfill you in life. These three things are home, lack of debt, and marriage. You have to have all three things to challenge the boss. Lack of debt I can maybe understand. I mean, who wants to spend their entire life effectively making nothing because every dime they make goes to someone else (college debt is slowly encroaching on me...). A home? Yeah, sure. I can maybe get behind that too. Not having to be accountable to someone else for the state of your home is pretty nice. I like being able to put a nail in my wall without having to fill out some paperwork for my landlord as much as the next person. But marriage? This is where I draw the line. Allow me to bring up a personal anecdote.In my senior year of high school, in my European history class, everyone was forced to read The Power of One by Bryce Courtenay. At some point or another, we were split into groups and tasked with the job of creating an alternate ending to the book. So this was probably after we had all finished the book. Well, I say 'we' very operatively. I don't recall ever personally finishing the book because I just didn't care anymore. I know protagonist kills one of his former tormentors and I think he goes to prison but I'm not sure what I'm supposed to get out of this. So we're talking about alternate endings and I can't remember what my ideas focused on, probably PK's boxing career, and another member of the group keeps trying to press this one idea. She agreed with everything else we said, whatever it was, but she kept trying to tack on a marriage. To the♥♥♥♥♥♥mentioned at the beginning of the book, oddly enough. I think she was referred to as 'Couchy' or something? Because everyone lays on her at some point or another? This partner of mine kept trying to force this marriage into the ending somehow as if that were the defining characteristic of a happy ending. Marriage. I'm not denying that marriage can probably make you happy (considering that I've never been married or even in a relationship in which marriage seems like a likely outcome) but I wouldn't make it a prerequisite. So that's a drag. Oh, and this one comment is for the easily triggered: I did not find any way to have a homosexual relationship. Make of that what you will.All in all, the game is decent enough to pass time, but I wouldn't really want to play it? Like, if you have a long car ride and can somehow play Steam games on your phone (maybe in the future... future... future...) it wouldn't be that bad but then I think - there are a ton of better games that I would rather be playing. So why play this one? If you like the snarky-sarcastic theme; some might even call it snarcastic. Though I'm not entirely sure whether snarky and sarcastic are synonyms. I can't recommend this game as a 'good' game though. It has humour... and that's about it. And humour can't carry a game like this. It worked in The Stanley Parable because the game was narrative driven and fairly short with multiple endings. It doesn't work in JRPGs because the bulk of the game is fighting, not narrative. So, sorry Cubicle Quest. I like the idea, but not the execution.			"

												I just can't recommend this game. It's just not fun. Any game that incorporates so much real life that it starts to drag down the gameplay, is just not fun. I know the guy was trying for funny, but he missed by a long way imo. Plus, it's just RPG Maker. Not even good RPG Maker. Everything is default RPG Maker assests, and the controls are the default controls. It's not hard to rebind to WASD. There's no changing the size of the box it's in, so you're stuck in this teeny little Gameboy sized window. I can't even call this guy a dev bc there's nothing original here. Nothing even changed from the default settings.			"

												Yet another indy game bloating the world and enforcing the ""95% of everything is junk"" rule.This one will do your head in trying to even get it to run - it relies on installing fonts, which in turn requires the Windows Firewall service to be enabled.  There's other ways to make a game display text than shoving fonts into my Windows font repository, by the way.   Totally unnecessary.  Otherwise, this game is a mediocre JRPG distinguished only by a slightly quirky schtick that you're an office worker.  Also, it's 2016, can games be 16:9 aspect ratio please?   Lack of PC settings are another thumbs down for this one.You'd be better off playing an old FFxx game on an emulator.			"

												OK, die Fakten:RPG-Maker Game, anscheinend ohne jedewede Änderungen aus dem Set.Lustiges Setting in oh, Spoiler, naja das Lustige war nach so 2 Minuten eh nur noch öde und hat eher gestört alsdas es Sinn machte.....das Team besteht jetzt aus Roommates, Statusveränderungen mögen andere Namen haben,sind aber trotzdem nur Standard. Und dann gibt es ab und an mal kleine Anspielungen auf die Spieleindustrie.Gameplay.....ihr habt vielleicht die allerersten J-RPG's noch in Erinnerung? Nein nicht die guten, die nichts Besonderes mein ich. Egal was euch die Texttafeln auch sagen mögen, es bleibt beim rumlaufen, random encounters, Quests finden,im Dungeon rumlaufen und Standard Monster verkloppen. Vieleicht mit der kleinen Ausnahme, das ihr gleich zu Anfangein Item findet, das euch zurück teleportieren kann.Was bleibt ist ein 08/15 Spiel. Und von denen gibt es schon genug (und teilweise umsonst).			"

												I was quite excited when I finally got this game and it is quite satisfying. Most of the negative reviews complained about how expensive it was; right now, I think the game is a gem with its price and a steal when it's on sale. For a $2 game, it gets a lot of things right.This game looks and feels very much like another RPG maker game. What sets it apart is:The creative narrativeThe game's story is quite refreshing and is peppered with humor. It isn't anything groundbreaking but it is still entertaining. You may find the conversation options with the NPCs a little stale after you exhaust them throughout the game, but you'll still be pleasantly surprised by the change of conversation lines every now and then which occur based on your actions / time elapsed.The thought provoking momentsAs a parody of life, Cubicle Quest actually offers a lot of food for thought. For example, defeating the extra expenses in the game made me think about how I could cut costs in my own life and waiting for a promotion in the game made me think about how sometimes you just need time to get things done. In the game, some of the things you thought were important end up totally useless in the grand scheme of things;all those cars, boats and rings you may buy aren't going to be one bit useful in the game. Some things just don't work out, just like in real life: you'll never marry Emily or Lisa no matter how hard you try. This applies even to NPCs: no matter how much Gina loves the main character, her limited skills and low effectiveness in combat (which can be implied as emotional support in real life) ultimately make her a poor choice for a partner compared to the other NPCs, mirroring the fact that no matter how much you love someone, you may never be the right one for him/her.The surprising amount of strategy involvedMost RPGs follow the concept of grinding, followed by buying weapons and armor and then min-maxing your stats. Cubicle Quest takes a slightly different approach by only selling consumables and giving you equipment as you progress through the story. Not only that, enemies have different types of attacks and can afflict different types of ailments, which can be countered by equipping the appropriate accessories; meanwhile, they have their various weaknesses which you can exploit with your skills and different characters. This keeps the game remarkably fresh as you're constantly figuring out and building your strategy to counter the enemies in the different dungeons. The freedom to do what you wantMost games are kind of linear and generally have some sort of order in which you have to complete the game. Cubicle Quest doesn't really enforce that; you can get married first and then buy a house, or get yourself promoted first etc, so long as you reach your goals in the end.The musicIt is actually quite good.That said, the game is not flawless and it can feel a little rough around the edges with a few trivial bugs and occasional crashes. Some of the game mechanics aren't really clearMost of the game is quite intuitive but some things can always be more clearly elaborated on (for example, one doesn't know how effective an accessory with ""Reduces damage"" is). This can be written off with ""life is sometimes vague"", but frankly speaking the game forces you to do a lot of trial and error whether you like it or not. Fortunately, there's a pretty comprehensive guide for those who hate to experiment too much.The freedom can frustrate youFreedom is a double-edged sword, especially in RPGs since you don't know where is the best place to go next for your level. You're very likely to wander into somewhere that's way beyond your skill level and get yourself slaughtered.The secrets can mislead youThere's actually quite a number of hidden gems in the game which make you wonder if there's more to be done, which can trick you into looking for secrets that were never there in the first place.The replayability isn't thereAfter you struggled so hard to reach the end, there isn't much incentive for the player to start all over again.

												Okay, I am probably in the minority here, but I did like this game overall.The enemy system was interesting most enemies belonging to one of three groups and most are easy to discern from each other via appearance or by name:  Personal enemies, human enemies, and work related enemies.Despite what people say the status ailments are pretty easy to figure out what is what if you know typical rpg status symbolslaziness = silenceetcIn fact my biggest issue with the game is how open ended it is after opening up the sea of ambition and how unbalanced some of the areas are.  Below I list my biggest problems:1)  The characters are very unbalanced, 70% of the enemies are personal enemies and one party member you can find learns the best skills versus that enemy type.  2)  Your defense never rises at a very fast rate meaning enemies later on do upwards to 2k damage to you with one attack if not more.3)  The superbosses even at lv 40+ are all still pretty difficult, I can't seem to beat the final version of the guardian of time, social judgement, or the 2nd form of the social expenses monster, among other painsOverall despite it's foibles it's pretty good so if it goes on sale for $1 or 2 again I'd say go for it it's pretty entertaining.

												Note: I am reviewing this form a blank perspective. I got this game for 50 cents and I in no way was hyped at all for it.Honestly, this is one of the better RPG Maker games I've played on Steam. The maps are made pretty well. The humor and the concept are funny. It seems to have some pretty unique mechanics compared to other rpg maker games. But once again I got it for 50 cents. If you can find it for that or lower I would recommend it easily. It's just a good fun RPG Maker game. But if you are one who kickstarted it I can understand why there is so much hate for it. I'd say just come in with expectations of any other RPG maker game and you will be pleased.			"

												There is a lot to like about this game. It is only minimally linear. There are several things you can do and only a few of them are required. It has good mechanics and there is a fun money management system here. The idea that resting to recover HP and MP causes time to advance a month is probably one of the smarter ideas of this game.However, the game is missing some very basic things that would make it so much better. First, a propper help screen would be nice. They don't do a great job explaining what does what so many combats end up being trial and error. Second, there isn't a settings screen, so I can't lower the music or sound effects, shame too since this is the kind of game I can play while listening to a podcast. Third, can't resize the screen in order to read things better.Still, does not mean the game is bad. It is fun and enjoyable and there was some clear thought put into it, which is why it is baffling that these basic features are not included.			"

												I'm probably pretty far from beating the game but I think I've experienced enough story and stuff to write a preliminary review. I'll update this when I finally beat the game.Bottom line: Cubicle Quest is a ramshackle mashup of life simulation and RPG. Worse-than-average system saved by good writing. A thought-provoking interactive prophecy of your own life. Grinding required.The life simulation part is... I shouldn't describe the story as fun or cheesy because it's not intended to be that way, save for the constant sarcastic reference of video game traditions and tropes; I'd rather say the story is something young adults like me can relate to, and (to a degree) learn from. Consumerism, drudgery, social convention, peer pressure, red herrings... The original author has many aspects of modern human experience covered. Sort of gives me a sense of actually living the main character's life.Throughout the game NPCs keep reminding me that the in-game world is constructed as nothing but a metaphor. As a part of gameplay this feature is rather distractive, but for this game it's not too inappropriate.It's because the RPG part is really just meh, just like what you see and hear in the official trailer. It's made up almost entirely of RPGMaker standard assets, quite unattractive. Graphics are passable, but maybe this game would be more enjoyable without any graphic overworld; a pure-text presentation should connect to the players just as well. The same goes for music. Some tracks feel too pumped-up and percussive for the scene while some could've been more uplifting or emotional. Game balance doesn't feel like it's been fine tuned. As someone else has pointed out, either we one-shot the monsters or they one-shot us. Yet the game's tutorial says no grinding is required. Maybe there's a certain route which I can just push through without grinding, but this game is heavily nonlinear, and as a result I run into overpowered monsters and get screwed now and then, here and there. For a game, this kind of experience really sucks.But as I mentioned, NPCs keep reminding me of the metaphor which is the entirety of Cubicle Quest's fantasy setting. Maybe this is life. You don't know where you're heading for, you don't know what's ahead, you don't know if you can deal with it. This realism has motivated me to keep playing, as I believe this game knows my future - or futures.			"

												I was very proud as my character defeated enemies like Distractions and Time Sinks again and again, and then I looked at myself, wasting hours on an RPG Maker game. Realizing that the game itself could be the final boss on some extreme meta levels, I closed it, uninstalled it, and probably received around 500 experience points. A great ARG.10/10, would waste my time fighting Time Sinks again, because I never learn.			"

												+ Very well written+ Good gameplay (especially for an RPG Maker game)+/- Challenging, but it may be too difficult for some players- Graphic quality is fine, but some would complain because it only uses pre-packaged assets from RPG MakerDon't buy this game looking for a unique art style or a complex narrative; while the writing is excellent, the story itself only serves to move the plot forward. Do buy it if you're interested in humor, well written dialogue, gameplay, and money management (with some actual life advice smuggled in). I honestly feel bad for buying this at 90% off.			"

												This game is funny, good RPG Maker variation on the theme of life with a special emphasis on money management. I'd really want to recommend but two things prevent me.1. The ""final"" boss is op. The instructions states the game is not grindy but I'm level ~30 and I see in comments elsewhere it's better to tackle at level ~60. That's a lot of missing levels. I've done everything else, even looked at a walkthrough to ensure I didn't miss anything. I *believe* it's doable around level 30, but you need serious luck on your side. The problem here is that the final boss is really a sequence of 8 fights. Fights #2-#6 are straightforward, but they take time and a bad RNG streak will result in a party wipe. After trying this sequence 5 times, I'm done. No way I'm spending time grinding 30 levels for a small RPG Maker game.2. Various monsters are weak against specific damage types and inflict ailments of a specific type. So far so good, staple of old school RPGs. However, this is not well explained in the game and there are no ways to ""analyze"" monsters. Trial and error ensues and I guarantee you'll not remember these combinations. The way to find if your character is protected against a type is via a ""resist"" popup when the damage is applied. Given each character has different equipment protecting against various types and the damage type is not specified, you need to scour your inventory post-battle and proceed by elimination: ""Character A was resistant to monster B's attacks. They have gear resistant to laziness and aggression. This means monster A does either laziness or aggression attacks."" And so on and so forth. On top of this, some monsters have nonsensical resistances. For instance, a work-related monster that is resistant to work attacks. It didn't take me long to stop bothering and the whole scheme fell flat.Overall, very interesting idea but I can't recommend in good conscience.			"
