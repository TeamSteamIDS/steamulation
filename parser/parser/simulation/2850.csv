												This is the sequel to X: Beyond The Frontier. If you master the X-BTF game and getting bored stuck in the X-Shuttle, try this! The only thing you have to keep in mind is the pirates and Xenon forces. Your X-Universe empire and reputation is EVERYTHING. Also the X-Shuttle is locked until you master the X-Universe, but when you get a special mission from the Paranid, I strongly advise you read the Egosoft forums on a secret guide on how to progress the mission fully. Because this mission is a one-way ticket, read more on the X-Tension fansites!			"

												I would recommend X: Tension for the mere fact that this is one of the best space trading sims I have personally played. I have played X2: The Threat, X3: Reunion and X3: Terran Conflict. While the later were pretty good in and of themselves, X: Tension goes back to the X universe roots. The cockpits were removed in the X3 series of games but X: Tension has them making the game more immersive. The trading system is more simplistic than the latest games due to the fact there is not as many items to trade. This can be a good thing. Complexity can sometimes ruin a game.			"

												You’re placed in a sandbox universe free to do as you please; bounty hunter, pirate, trader, station manager…Often feels empty and lacking content, has frustrating keyboard controls, simple AI, has poor support for mice so a joystick is a must but despite that it’s quite fun.			"

												X-Tension is the expansion to X Beyond The Frontier and this is where the series really really begins to take the shape we know from the later games. Multiple starting points have been added as well as the ability to change ship at your leisure making this a much more smooth and enjoyable experience than Beyond The Frontier.The graphics and interface have received a major overhaul not only making the game far more pleasant to look at but also much easier to figure out.The addition of multiple starting points now allow you a bit of an advanced start if you have to restart as well as the ability to specialize before the game has even started. This all goes a long way towards making learning the game a much easier experience. Satellite control systems now means you have the ability to manage your interstellar trading empire from a distance without the need to dock with every station you own to check on it's progress and this automation feature also helps makes the gameplay feel much more smooth than it was in Beyond The Frontier.A heavy duty AI improvement makes every part of the game better and the new addition of random missions gives a little purpose to those players that aren't completely satisfied with the open and unstructured nature of the game.This however is all just an appetizer when put against the biggest change of all. You are no longer confined to a single ship for the entire game. In X-Tension you are allowed to change ship at a whip and practically every ship you see in the game can flown, from the light scouts to the heavy fighters and the cumbersome traders you can now chose your ship to match your mission and this makes the game much easier to play in a huge way.All in all X-Tension is the game that introduced many of the concepts we now associate with the X series and in many ways it really is the game that made the series the industry standard it has become today. It's not a game without faults but for it's time it was a huge deal and a great game that holds many fond memories.			"

												As a matter of full disclosure I've been playing this game (on and off) for around 17 years.  I tried X2 and didn't like it; I haven't tried any of the X3 games yet either so my review is based solely on the X-Tension gameplay and not the progression of the series.All that said; I love this game and always have.  I like the fact that you have the flexibility to fly around in almost any ship you choose (or at least can afford) and I like the fact that you can run a small empire of ships and stations as you see fit.  I love the open world model of the game (I never played the XbtF storyline anyway) and that your choices, while consequential, are not linear.  There's no 'good' and 'bad', just alignment with the various factions in their space.There are some downsides.  The game feels very isolated in that you don't have station based interactions.  You're always in the cockpit of your ship, not hanging in a bar or some other location on the bases, like you would in Freelancer or Privateer.  The property management system is text and keyboard based and takes a while to navigate around to what you really want to do.  Right-click, tree structured context sensitive menus would have come in really handy here.  Mind you, when you understand the system well enough, you can do almost everything you want.  That said, the navsat requirement to control any resources in system is an unnecessary complication that makes no sense.  Far better to make your property menu accessible in all sectors straight off the bat.  Speaking of which, having some of your ships just 'disappear' from your property screen because they're going through systems you haven't personally visited yet is confusing and very frustrating.  It would be far better not to allow your owned ships to travel through sectors you haven't 'discovered' yet at all.  Otherwise you're never sure if you've lost them for real.The one thing I used to love about this game was the on-line community.  In 2001 at least, it was very active in the old THQ forum and the game almost felt like the modern MMOs like EVE Online, only you would never see your friends whizzing by in their ships.  I don't know what the modern forum is like (because I wasn't allowed to preserve my Acid handle between forums) but if it's even half as good then it would still be a great group of people to hang out with.The thing I always liked about this game was the open world feel and the way you could amass a fleet of ships to fly, including a large transport.  You never got into the battleships and the like, but the TL class boats could act as de facto carriers anyway, so that was pretty good.  I lost interest in upgrading after X2, which (like a lot of MOO clones) thought that adding complexity added richness, which it doesn't.  X-Tension got the balance right IMHO, although I'd be interested in knowing sometime if any of the X3 games went back to that formula.  That said, I'm still playing X-Tension after all these years.  That should tell you something about how playable the game really is.			"

												Game starts off slow..however once one starts trading goods  in an upgraded ship and adding on needed ship upgrades itbecomes addictive.  Like the first X Beyond the Frontier, starts slow then it is up to you to do what you want.If you like action, then you'll have to find the fight and like real time everything cost money.  Don't cheat it really takes awayfrom the game.Yep! No real story line just  do you thing, what ever that may be.			"

												I didn't buy this game on steam, I bought the boxed version as soosn as I could get my hands on it. X-Tension (be sure you have the V2.0 upgrrade.  is more than an addon it's really a new version of X-Beyond the Frontier. And the game it always should have been. It's a true open world sandbox game where you can fly any ship in the game from shuttle to Carrier. It is also the game where the X series hit it's peak as far as I'm concerned. X2 had a different Manga type style Ididn't like and they stopped giving every ship it's own interior. And starting with X 3 they done away with interiors at all. It spoiled the atmosphere for me. X-Tension V2 is old now, but much like Morrowind in the elder scrolls series, it still stands out. "

												Fun game. This Bridges the gap between X: Beyond the Frontier and X2: The Threat. Unlike in X:BTF, you can buy and fly almost any ship in the game, the only exception being destroyers and carriers. There is no story mode just, a sandbox. Also unlike the first game, you start with 2500 credits and a SETA.			"

												i purchased this game as part of the x series sale on steam which was several months ago.  i have had no issues at all running all of the other titles.  this game, however, just does not run.  if you are running win 7 64 bit and are interested in the x series i would set your targets to the other titles which run just fine.  the forums are of little help in terms of troubleshooting and egosoft doesnt seem to pay attention to them.  would have really enjoyed this game...kind of a let down.

												*Attempts to launch game*  - ""X-Tension NOT INSTALLED"" WTF did I just play?  - It's hilarious! Must be even better when you're drunk! Seriously, if you're not used to these types of games or the X-Series itself, when you first boot the game, it's like a puzzle! It's like 2 games in one, a puzzler figuring out what the heck is going on, then the actual game itself, which i haven't managed to witness yet outside of ""The End"". On the plus side, it seems as though (once your figure it out) there's a lot of depth and customization in the game, and is an apt reminder of the detail to gameplay content that was once put in games over a decade ago. There are so many options and things to control that its initially confusing, but at the same time impressive, and once you get past the bizarrely leftsided illegible text, genuinely intrigues you into finding out more not only about this game, but the future ones in the series that may perhaps a bit more suited to the non-veterans.Can I recommend this? Only if you have a sense of humour, a lot of patience, or are a space combat flight simulator vet.			"
