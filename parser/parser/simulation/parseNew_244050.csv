												This review is, for the record, not sarcasm. I have played this game, way more than I care to admit. It is genuinely fantastic.Let's just get the hyperbole out of the way up front. Rise of Flight is, in my mind, easily one of the best flight sims ever made. It's a shame this business model switch has opened the floodgates to reviewers who haven't given the game much of a shot. This is a flight sim, and an in-depth one at that. You need to try it for more than an hour or two to even finish a mission. I'm frankly astonished that so many people have clicked that they found some of these reviews helpful.This is a game that serves a small audience. It would not exist if not for this business model. A business model, that if you really look at it, is not a bad deal for gamers. Sure, the base free game is basically a demo. Why is that bad? You didn't pay anything for it. Realistic flight simulators are not main stream gaming by any strech of the imagination, and if people want them to exist, they need to understand that they're going to have pay for content. Purchasing each plane pack gets you the use of included planes everywhere. Further, you can absolutely dive into the game with just the one included plane, and even purchasing just a single plane pack gives you a massive amount to do.No game has captured the sensation of flight like Rise of Flight. The game really does give the impression you're in a hot-rod car with cloth wings and a gun mounted to the front that is somehow flying. Having your wing partly seared off in a battle is terrifying, and clawing your way back from No Man's Land to land while spewing smoke and being chased by enemies is an experience few other games have matched for me. I've bombed bridges, photographed troop movements, and won dogfights by crippling my opponent piece by wooden piece. I'd strongly recommend anyone thinking about purchasing content for this game look up professional reviews, most of which are very positive.This game isn't a traditional free-to-play game, that much I conceed. It is not an iOS game, or a play-to-win game, or an arcade flight game, or whatever else people think they're getting. It is an amazing simulator that demands your full attention.Do you want to know what WWI flight combat really felt like? For that, nothing out there comes even remotely close to Rise of Flight.			"

												If you want to get a good idea on what this game is like, I will ask you something: Have you played IL-2 Sturmovik* before?I ask this because Rise of Flight is essentially identical to IL-2 in terms of total realism (also including a load of difficulty settings, so you can switch off black-/red-out, switch on infinite fuel, etc. just to make the transition into the game easier), just with Great War-era aircraft, as opposed to World War II-era aircraft.However, this one detail alone sets it apart from the IL-2 games quite a bit, as the quality of aircraft in RoF is substantially lower than what is found in IL-2, for fairly obvious reasons. Instead of being able to dogfight where you can afford to be almost entirely focused on the enemy plane/s a la IL-2, you will need to split your attention 50/50 between the enemy aircraft and your own aircraft. This is because simply put, the aircraft found in WWI were in fact nicknamed ""kites"" for a reason! Your plane is incredibly fragile and is prone to having its wings snap off or its engine conk out (typically in the form of the oil in the engine suddenly and unexpectedly pouring out onto your face) seemingly on a whim. If you're familiar with the cold sweat-inducing feeling of nursing your crippled Heinkel back to the airfield in IL-2, this is the feeling you will generally have while flying a plane in RoF normally. (Hell, take-off can very easily become quite fatal!)In summary, Rise of Flight is more-or-less IL-2 Sturmovik cranked up to ""hardcore mode"", and it's brilliant! (Also, although the extra content packs seem quite pricey, they are actually packed with quite a lot of content; so I'd say get acquainted with the base game or demo on the RoF site, then get one or two of the packs that you like the look of during a sale)* If you haven't, I recommend getting IL-2 Sturmovik 1946 or Battle of Stalingrad.

												I found this to be a good game, with a lot of content available. Since this is a simulation, it has the things you expect, good graphics, good fidelity (I've never flown an actual WW1 fighter, but things seem right to me FWIW), and enjoyable. I say enjoyable for me, but it may not be everyone's cup of tea. It aims for the same realism as DCS, and coming from some time in DCS I think it compares favorably. Because of the setting, I didn't have to spend 10 hours programming a joystick and wading through tutorials and was able to jump in and fly relatively quickly. Less complexity to the Aircraft makes it more fun for me.Speaking of fun, I can't overstate the immersion factor having a campaign mode brings to this game. Its supposed to be in Beta, but to me its already pretty complete. I do look forward to more improvements in this regard, but having a campaign mode makes the whole thing worthwhile. I miss the days of the old MP Sims where a career mode was just so much fun and the campaign mode in this game puts all those hours spent in-game in context. Still not what it could be but shows a lot of promise and head and shoulders above anything else out there for a sim game.			"

												Ok so we need to clarify some things! I am a flight simulator passionate for years,i have thousands of hours in many different combat flight simulator and yes,Rise of Flight IS A GOOD FLIGHT SIMULATOR!I see most negative reviews here are because you only get 2 planes and the rest you must buy!I have played Rise of Flight for more than a year and only recently bought a pack with 6 more planes.The 2 planes that you get for free,the Albadros D.V and the SPAD.13 are two of the best planes in the game!!!Also,the map that you get for free,the Western Front one si the biggest map in the game,so you will not get bored with it!Even tough the Campaigns are not unlocked until you buy a certain plane,let me tell you,i have never even tried the Scripted campaign,even tough i own the necesary planes,because the dynamic career is just SOO much better!You can just literally play it forever!It randomly generates a mission every time! Also when it comes to multiplayer,with the free version of the game you will have no problem playing,and as i said,the 2 free plane sthat you get are one of the best in game,so you will not have that much problem!To wrap it up,Rise of Flight is the best WW1 flight simulator out there,and one of the best flight simulators in general!Its beautiful,atmospheric and realistic!Totally recomending it!P.S.:NO,IT IS NOT PAY TO WIN!

												The Rolls Royce Silver Shadow of flight sims. Beautiful and expensive.From the dawn of dogfighting flying these tempermental aircraft (basically kites with engines), was either an act of insane bravery or couragous madness. For anyone who takes dogfighting seriously the skills learned in this era will be applicable to any other time and theatre of combat. And for those of us who remember the legendary Red Baron, RoF can be considered the spiritual successor thanks to the introduction of the Career Mode. A fully laden sim, and an extremely accurate and very enjoyable stripped down air combat experience.			"

												WARNING: Only after you bought and installed the game you get to read the TOS (terms of service) for the game and many things you read there you will not belive. 777 Studios give themselves so many rights (ranging from changing the TOS over night to charging you at a later date or even not accepting payments you allready done until theses payments appear on their bank account). All these things are illegal in Europe, therefore they are void here, as far as I know. So if you aren't living in Europe, be very cautious what you sign up for. And don't give them any email-adress you might need later.			"

												Just a little list of things I do and don't like about this game:THE PLUS: + Really good graphics for a simulator, but REALLY good graphics. + Good and active AI, no ""easy"" experience in this game. + The physics work really nice and keeping the plane steady is (in my opinion) pretty hard. + UPDATE: It is now free for everyone.THE MINUS: - Expensive game (I come back to this later) - Single player missions are poorly set up. - The ""Fly Now"" or free flight game mode doesn't really work. - The controls are not really ""made"" for this game. I had some struggles getting the hang of it.THE NEUTRAL: - I haven't tested the multiplayerI haven't put a lot of time into this game, simply because of this:When you want to play this game, you pay 37 Euros to 777 studios, and there's nothing wrong with that.However, you need to unlock MOST OF THE PLANES after you bought the game, and no, not by playing the game,you need a KEY to activate the specific model and these keys do cost actual MONEY.This game has microtransactions in it, and it's a paid game. Really? Don't the producers earn enough money alreadyby just selling this game?Please 777 Studios, make the game fully playable, without microtransactions, and you will get a positive review from me,but as it is now, it just isn't worth the money...UPDATE:The game got even more expensive. Instead of 37 euros they are now charging 45 euros to get this game sold. Looking at the ToS that becomes filled with more crap each day, you should really let this game go or you must be a true fan of dog fighting and have about a million in your steam wallet to buy all the dlc (which you are forced to buy to even get to play the base game... yeah.)UPDATE:Apparently this game is now free to play and all the DLC together will cost you roughly 170 - 200 euros/dollars. Now I didn't pay a single penny for this, but if you did (during the time this game was still a paid game, for an amazing 45 euros (!)), I can understand that you are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off. 777 Studios just made the game free to play as an excuse to all the bugs that are still in the game (which won't be fixed as well).

												I figured I'd go ahead and rewrite this review from scratch as I'm tired of getting hate mail from fanboys, and I'm tired of replying to them like a broken record. I'll format my review as a list of replies to the most common strawman arguments I get.First, if you own this game from several years ago, or play the ""FTP"" version directly from ROF's site, then get the ♥♥♥♥ out, you don't know what you're talking about here. As near as I can tell, the Steam version of this game is drastically different (as in, far worse) than the other versions.Second, if you're the sort to accuse people of not knowing anything about flight because they mention War Thunder, then ALSO get the ♥♥♥♥ out. I've flown Cessnas in real life, I've been playing flight simulators since I was a little kid (13-15 years), and have played a myriad of flight sims including X-Plane 9 and 10 (used by the FAA to train pilots), Flight Sim X, Orbiter, Flight Gear, Lock On, IL-2, and the entire CFS series. So go ♥♥♥♥ yourself if you're here just to call me a ""war thunder kiddy"" for having the gall to mention it in my review.The good parts about this game is that it has a great flight model, an even better damage model, and alright graphics considering its age... That's where the good parts end. The UI and mission parameters are obnoxious.The biggest negative (which in my opinion, outweigh the positives) is this game's business model (among a few other minor things I won't have enough room to go into).The short of it is: THIS IS NOT A FREE TO PLAY GAME. FTP in recent years has come to mean a specific kind of business model, which most of you already know about. If you've never played a legit free to play game, then go try one out (like world of tanks or war thunder) BEFORE leaving a nasty hate comment about me supposedly expecting everything to be free.""Stop comparing this to War Thunder you peasant, it cannot match the awesome flight model of ROF""One example of a LEGIT free to play flight game is War Thunder (Que hate mail). I'm not saying War Thunder is a great game. It's definitely not. They've been removing sim battles, and turning realistic battles into arcade with slightly better flight models, so I can't even make the ""realism"" argument in its defense anymore. ROF has War Thunder beat in realism. There, ya happy? Now quit telling me what I already know. I never said WT was better than ROF in flight model, just in business model.The REASON I compare that game to this one is because War Thunder actually HAS a decent free to play business model. If you've come to ROF looking for a FTP flight game, trust me, it's SO not. I would recommend War Thunder if you're looking for a FTP flight game (espescially if you're not too serious about realism, and are just looking for something more casual).So, ROF is NOT like War Thunder. I was dissappointed by this, because when I think of a free to play game, I think of a business model like War Thunder's. When I see that ""Free To Play"" tag, it's an expectation I have, one that is severely dissappointed when I waste 2 hours finding out what this game's business model is really like. This should be considered false advertising, since 90% of ROF can't actually be played for free... What else is this game NOT like?""It's like DCS""As near as I can tell, this game is NOT like DCS... So stop saying that it is. I have yet to play DCS, though I plan on it at some point. DCS only has one DLC explicitly related to campaigns or missions. Everything else is just planes. As such, I suspect most of DCS' content comes with that initial free download, and the DLCs are OPTIONAL planes that people can buy to fly in that already existing free content. Although it's not the sort of setup I would've gone with, it's still not bad. It's infinitely better than what ROF has done. Evidence of this fact lies in the fact that this game has almost 50% negative reviews (and rising), while DCS has only about 20%. CLEARLY, something's different enough between the 2 to make people like DCS a helluva lot more, and I suspect it's the business model.Alright, so this game is NOT like War Thunder (despite its misleading ""free to play"" label) and it's NOT like DCS (quit saying it is). But what IS this game like. I've pointed out what it's not like for the benefit of the dip♥♥♥♥♥ who keep commenting about DCS and War Thunder.This game is a 7-8 year old game that USED to be offered for 30-50 dollars for 100% of the game's content (Or at least, A LOT of the content). It was basically old school, before all this DLC nonsense really took over. I would GLADLY spend 50 dollars down payment on this game for all or most of its content. That's what this game's business model was DESIGNED for, and it's what the game devs should've ♥♥♥♥ing stuck to.Instead, they had a massive rush of♥♥♥♥♥♥to the brain, took that 50 dollars worth of pre-existing content OUT of the game, and are now selling it piecemeal for a total of 200-300 dollars. DCS was INTENDED to be DLC based from the start. This game's devs on the other hand tried to copy-cat that game with turning pre-existing content into DLC to make more money... And they SO went overboard trying to do so. They made EVERYTHING a DLC.And this ISN'T just the planes, like what DCS seems to do. Most of the campaign mission series' need to be bought as DLC. And I can't even play the supposedly ""free"" campaign series because each mission in those campaigns REQUIRES you to use a certain aircraft... Which means I need to go buy that aircraft before playing that mission. And you need to play missions in sequence as well, so I can't even skip to the missions that DO use the 2 or 3 free aircraft.All the multiplayer servers seem to require plane purchases as well, though according to the devs, there's supposedly a server for just the FTP planes (though I certainly couldn't find it).All that's left is some sort of dynamic campaign thing you can't play half of, and a few free maps. You can't play much more than the training missions. 90% of the content needs to be bought, and then you need to buy the planes for the content on top of that.That's not ""Free to Play"". That's a DEMO. Put your game in that category instead, and maybe you wont get so many negative reviews from dissapointed gamers. You're LYING to gamers by labelling this as ""Free to Play"", because it just isnt.""You should review the game itself, not the business model or advertisement""No, because the business model and false advertising is part OF the game. How can I recommend a game that's advertised poorly, and simply isn't worth the money?""This is a niche community, that's why it's expensive""Funny, the company that made this game seems to have made a decent enough profit off of offering 100% of this game's content for 30-50 dollars for the past 7 years. Seems the only thing that's changed is how willing a niche community is to blindly buy DLC without considering whether or not it's worth that much money as a whole. It so ISNT worth 200-300, and if this is the trend for flight sims now thanks to you guillible saps, then I want the ♥♥♥♥ out of this ""niche community"". You all need to stop listening to the blatant lie that this aging game is suddenly worth 300 dollars just because it's a flight sim\. This game was offered for just 1/6th that for most of its history.""You shouldn't expect everything for free you commie""I don't. I expect products to not use false advertising, and go for either a reasonable down payment price, or a decent F2P business model. This is me protesting a game I feel is unfairly priced, by not buying it. Either make the game use a legitimate free to play business model, or label this a DEMO and charge a reasonable down payment for the full game. Simple as that.""Whether or not price is worth it is completely subjective (That's just, like, your opinion, man)""So are reviews. Go figure.			"

												A flight sim set in era that is ofter over looked by most, RoF offers a very realistic approach to World War I air combat.  The game offers both single player missions/careers as well as an online mode.  Difficulty and controls can all be tweaked to help those who are new to the genre, but make sure that you have a joystick as it is a must.  If you love air combat simulators or are a fan of the period then don't pass this game up!			"

												For the benefit of some reviewers that think the devs are being greedy. This game was never F2P until only recently. It always had the DLC model and thousands of people have been happily playing this excellent sim for years before the likes of wargaming and gaijin came along. I do find it odd that a minority of gamers these days think its plain WRONG for devs to make money! Let me explain....it costs money to produce a game of this quality! programmers, artists, equipment...etc etc. How do you think F2P works anyway? An army of fairies and munchkins grinding away for your benefit....get real. Non rant over.Now, as far as a review goes....for me the only downside is that it does take time to get used to the excellent flight models and physics. Invest in a decent joystick for maximum enjoyment and if it makes any difference, dont listen to the neg reviews who bang on about GREEDY devs. You will get your ROI back in sheer pleasure.Rock on.

												Simply the greatest WWI flight sim ever. The sensation of flying in this game is very realistic, the combat is historically accurate, and the graphics are beautiful. Every aircraft type has a unique personality and takes hours to master. This game is not perfect but there is a great deal of fun here to be had for armchair pilots.Do not operate near children, the elderly, or small animals. It's a hardcore flight sim and is light years beyond W********r in terms of required skill. It's more of a ""free to try"" game than ""free to play""; most of the really interesting aircraft are DLC. Understand this before knocking RoF. Also, this sim is still supported by the developers and they are continually updating and adding new content -- 7 years from release.			"

												For those who loved the Red Baron series in the 90's this is an excellent game. Fiendishly difficult if the realism is cranked to the fullest. You can fine tune your realism settings to your liking, but still a decent flightstick is a must. I haven't tried the multiplayer at all. I mostly fly the career mode which is randomly generated and very nicely done. If you're into flight sims and particulary this era, this is a must buy. Yes, there is a lot of money to be spent here, most of the planes are not included in the base game. But like in DCS the quality of the individual planes and the differences in flightmodels and handling are distinct. In my opinion, when something is made with this kind of dedication, it's worth a few euros.In short: It's a great simulation! You never forget your first air to air victory (because it's hard at first).			"

												This is one of the best WW1 aviation games you will ever find. Truly. People just don't understand the way it has been divided up into paid segments. They install, they click ""Quick Mission"" and get the glitch that tells them they have to pay for the Nieuport it selects by default (just select one of the 3 planes you do own) and then quit out thinking they got cheated.Yes, the DLC looks expensive on Steam. No, you don't need any of it to fly around and have fun. You get three incredibly capable planes to fly with the free client and you can create missions with these aircraft, fly multiplayer skirmishes, and on. Anyone saying you can't play without paying or that it isn't free-to-play: it is. It certainly isn't free-to-play in the same sense as a mobile game; you cannot unlock anything in the sim without buying it. However, this is stated on the store page quite clearly.I have played many flight sims in my day, and one of my old favorites was a '90s WW1 dogfighter game called Red Baron. Anyone else remember that game? This is just as playable and compelling, and with the addition of more roles like recon/observation and dedicated bomber planes it has a ton of variety.Don't let the Steam reviews tell you this isn't worth the time or money- just get the planes you want from the publishers website. With the riseofflight.com store you can get anything at any time for 50% off; save up 15 bucks and if you get 6 things at once it's half off. This way you can just buy exactly what you are interested in instead of Steam's package deals. Given that, the best way to handle your ROF account is to do the following:1) Register your account on riseofflight.com and not through the Steam client (""Rise of Flight United"")2) Ensure that listed under your profile's ""license keys"" you have a key called exactly ""ROF FREE2PLAY""3) Download the Steam game and log in with the account you just created. Now you can purchase the cheaper aircraft one at a time if you wish or in custom bundles for a discount, and use them on your Steam client.There aren't many flight games out there any more. I'd hate to see a great one die off because people couldn't understand the way it had been monetized.			"

												No, I would not recommend......even though it's a good flight simulation, the high cost and DLC cost coupled with equaly high learning curve.>|< Quantatitive Rating = 7 out of 10 >|<______________________________Observations and other musings...You pay a lot for little!Yes, it is a very good flight sim: one of the best I have tried.  However, the price point for the base game gives you only the basics and then you have to dish out a heck of a lot of money just for some basic enhancements... like planes that should have been available from the start!.On the Steam December 2014 sale, the game wason for 60% off, which means the base game and the DLC will still cost you about $120...OMG on sale!  For that kind of money I should be able to have every piece of kit that flew in the sky in the First World War!Now get this, if $120 at 60% off doesn't satisfy your need to open your wallet, just remember, the undiscounted price is $55 for the game plus $240 for DLC!  These guys are as greedy as the guys that develop and market the DCS World sim.So, if you really want to experience a good WW1 flight sim, then get it while it's on sale, because that kind of money would be better spent on something more enriching than wasting your time on a computer, like taking your love for a romantic getaway… ;-)Now, I appreciate good quality software development.  I always look for historically accurate depictions of warfare.  I really love it when these two factors come together.  This game system is a rare breed that achieves this in a fairly good way.  The flight dynamics are great.  The planes beautiful.  The adversaries deadly.  It’s a pretty good game!But I will be ♥♥♥♥ed if I dish out that kind of money for DLC.  I will wait for a better product with more reasonable price model.			"

												Great simulation of early warplanes. Graphics and sounds are good. Flight model and aircraft simulation are very accurate and detailed. There is plenty of variation and things to do and there are multiple customization options for planes.Multiplayer especially has very cool features such as sharing same aircraft: a friend can be the gunner while you are flying the plane. Especially with the Felixstowe ""flying boat"" you take off from water, have buddies as gunners while going on a bombing missions: there really are very few simulation supporting that kind of interaction.Keep in mind that these planes are not easy to fly, especially not in combat.The engines are not powerful and amount of lift from the rudimentary wings is not a lot.Simulation is accurate representation of the early era of flight and for people interesting in flying biplanes this definitely is worth it to buy.So keep above points in mind when deciding if this is for you.Recommended for fans of WWI planes and flight sim fans in general.

												Rise of Flight is an amazingly detailed and realistic flight/combat simulation that offers some very tense, fun gameplay. A lot of reviews I've seen complain that even though it's free, you only get one map and three planes, but I think this gives the player time to see whether the game is right for them before buying additional content.Furthermore, you can also play with any AI plane, so can still experience all the aircraft available without making a purchase. Multiplayer mode is easy to use and very challenging (or easy if you decide you want a casual flight) and there are no bugs I have seen so far. The only thing I would say is that it is a whole lot easier with a joystick or flight controller, but is perfectly playable (while a bit tricky) with a keyboard and mouse.Overall a great game and there is no excuse for trying it out if you have any doubts!

												For fans of WWI dog fighters this is a solid game engine, but frankly the servers it runs on are slow and buggy, career mode has been unavailable to me 3 times now and I just got the game, moreover at 50$ you get what is little more than a demo version asking you to pay 200$ for DLC to unlock all available content, It does start you with an old favorite of any Red Barron player the Sopwith Camel but most aerodromes and start dates are unavailable until you fork over more cash. The game lacks some degree of immersion I would want at the price of 50$ and the DLC is shameless. I will say the game plays well but in terms of bang for your buck it falls far short of IL-2(10$ on steam) and the massive amount of free mods available. For a hardcore dogfight fan you may be happy, but for me personally the price tag is just way to far from the benchmark.			"

												777 Studios always makes their AI pilots superhuman headshot machines who fly their planes at the edge of the envelope 100% of the time, but you are not. You will need to learn WWI aerobatic combat maneuvers to have any chance of defeating them, but there are training vids on Youtube to teach you. You need a joystick and TrackIR setup would help alot. Use the Smoothing feature for your joystick axii or your ride will be very bumpy. Biplanes are actually a lot less finicky than they are in this game, but the flight model is okay. Just if you have ever flown in a 1920's biplane you will be wondering what's wrong with the plane.Once you get beyond all that RoF is a great game. The graphics are ultra-realistic and the planes beautifully re-created. I bought my Steam version when it was on sale last Xmas and the deals were pretty good. Cheaper than updating my original release DVD version. Kind of pricey at full price.			"

												Several negative reviews have mentioned how the game is totally gutted and not actually free-to-play. Well, they seem to have listened, because it has changed. What it is: A decent WW1 combat simulation. It has Single Missions, Campaigns, Career Mode, and Multiplayer. The flight models are very good (my only beef here is a complete lack of torque and P-factor, but that may be my options), and you can switch between different gunner and pilot stations on your planes. This makes flying bombers really fun. The whole thing seems to be based on the DCS/IL-2 engine. You get DCS graphics and effects, with IL-2 style menus and interface.What you get:The free-to-play version now includes THREE planes, a campaign, and a career mode. Obviously, more can be purchased to increase your options as to what you can play and fly (more campaigns, planes), but the basic gameplay is all there. Extra planes and content aren't expensive if you wait till they go on sale.If you like to fly and are looking for something different, give this a shot with some friends. Do some dogfights for free, then decide what kind of DLCs you all want. Bombers are fun to multi-crew, for starters. ;-)			"

												This simulator opened a world of fascination for me. After playing for two weeks or so, I began to look for anything about WWI aviation -- stories, movies, books, and airplane models. The level of historical detail in Rise of Flight is extremely impressive, especially the vast variety of historical ""skins"" for the planes you fly, and how certain planes are available to certain squadrons at specific points during the war (in career mode).It's tough going at first, and I managed to crash probably 20 times before I managed to get my first kill in a dogfight. Once you learn about the quirks and idiosyncrasies of the individual planes, it gets much easier. Be sure to check out Requiem's excellent tutorial videos for a smoother start.If you are into flight simulators or the history of WWI in any way, I very much recommend Rise of Flight.			"

												Recommended - with a few caveats.Version reviewed: Rise of Flight - Channel Battles EditionAt the time of writing this sim is selling on Steam for £8.99, and the DLC between £4.79 and £6.89.  I'm willing to buy DLC of this quality at this price (in fact I've bought the lot).  When compared to £15 I just paid for the FSX Spitfire I think the Rise of Flight DLC represents good value; at full price, however, I'm not so sure.  All flight sims seem to have adopted the DLC model, with DCS World typically charging 30 quid for theirs.  They should all be put against a wall and shot.The DRM and registration is a pain, and I don't think it's made clear quite how to do this properly.  On first registering the game you're taken to the ROF website to create an account, and (if I remember correctly) you're given an activation key - but this activation key is for the demo version, and you also have to paste in your Steam purchase key as well or you do not get the Channel Battles Edition (I spent quite a while swearing and cursing about what thieves these guys were until I worked this bit out).  Likewise with the DLC, all you get from Steam is an activation key which must be entered before anything will work.The graphics and detail are gorgeous on a half decent machine (mine's two years old, so state of the art isn't required), but to set things up you need to launch a separate settings.exe file hidden away in SteamApps\common\Rise of Flight 2.0\bin_game\release\.As for the game itself, where it's good it's absolutely outstanding, and where it isn't so good it really is cr@p.  The learning curve is steep.  Those early planes were awful, and real pigs to control.  This is reflected in the flight models, and even getting the damned things off the ground is a challenge.  If you want to jump straight into dogfights without learning how to work these things you won't last long; you'll tear your wings off or spin into the ground or, maybe, get shot down.  If you're not willing to spend time learning this game then think carefully before buying it, you might be better buying something else.  On the other hand, if you do stick with it, the first time you successfully take off, complete a few circuits and land safely is a real buzz.  This sim creates a feeling of actually being in the air better than any other I've played.Where it's not so good is the mission and career selection, which all seems very muddled.  And while the the aircraft modelling is excellent, the character modelling is the worst I've seen for years, with voice acting so atrocious I winced the first time I heard it.Overall then: if you think you'd enjoy a challenging flight sim, and if it's at the right price, you should buy it.  Otherwise go to the ROF website and download the demo before spending any money.Now I'm off to have another go at getting that damned bomber off the ground...			"

												This is one of the finest flight simulators I have ever played. Been flying sims since I was a kid.There are a few accessories you should probably have to get the maximum enjoyment out of this title and they aren't cheap. A head tracking device is almost necessary to get the immersion out of this title. When coupled with headphones, you can hear the nuanced wind sounds as you turn your head in your cockpit, trying to keep a beat on your enemies or just looking around at the gorgeous scenary. A flight stick is highly recommended, of course. Just like trying to play an FPS title with a controller is alike to eating ice cream with a shovel, trying to play a functional flight sim with a keyboard does not allow you the full spectrum of movement that you should have.Now, you don't have to have these things, but they are very nice to have. The problem is that these things are expensive, as is this game. I wouldn't say it's ""overpriced"" because the level of detail makes it evident that there was a lot of work that went into this title. The DLC is also very expensive and it is somewhat harder to excuse this, but the DLC themselves are bundled into packages that at least make sense. For instance, if you buy the package containing bombers, you get mostly bombers. All things considered, this is a hard game to recommend, unless you fall under the banner of a very niche audience. If you have doubts about this purchase, watch a few videos online and see if this would be for you. It's a beautiful experience, but to get the most enjoyment out of it you have to have a certain set up.			"

												I'm a pilot, in real life.  I'm also a big gamer, and have played most of the flight  sims out there.  This game is good.  The graphics are exellent, the flight physics are a great blend between fun and simulation, and it hits all the right notes.  The ability to fine tune the flight physics in the game options, opting between linear and S-curved feedback controls from your joystick, for example, make this game a step above the others in terms of the serious pilot simulator.That said, this game does have some miscues.  The menu options are somewhat vague and not very intuitive.  This is true throughout the game, and is a serious issue when you're trying to set up your camera hotkeys, for example.  It's more than just a little confusing.  The tutorial is kind of a joke, and is probably better skipped altogether.  The second tutorial, for example, turns you loose in the plane but doesn't explain how to start the engine...  and like everything in this game, there's a key combination to do that for you.... if you can find it.Don't get caught thinking that there's only 2 or 3 planes to play.  There are more, but again, there's no documentation about how to install the game properly, so you'll end up playing the Free to Download version that doesn't have all the maps or planes unlocked.  Simply write down your CD key after you install it, and add that to your online profile that you've created.  Next time you log in, it should unlocked most of the planes and maps in the game.This game is hard...  and it didn't have to be.  With some proper documentation, hot keys, and a serious effort on the english tutorial, it would have been a great game.  It's still a lot of fun, if lacking a little in the atmosphere department, but overall a good sim.			"

Posted: February 11, 2015
												now when i got this game i didn't understand why it had mixed reviews, i watch videos on youtube and the flight simulator community eats this game up like a fresch cherry pie, they seem to love the hell out of it and talk so highly out of it, so when i saw the mixed reviews i was kind of suprised, and didn't undersand and now I do... now before i get too that lets get too the Pros of the game.PROSthe pros of this game are simple, if you are a avid flight simulator player like myself you will enjoy the higher graphics the game has to offer, clean, smooth, the game has VERY nice graphics and seem to be somewhat realistic in appearence on the aircraft, the cockpits also are nicely detailed with working gauges, instroments and controls, and just like any other flight simulator getting kill after kill is addicting. damage effects are pretty spectacular too watch, peaces of wing come off, fires spread rather than just rapidly burst, props break, holes develope on the aircraft pretty much where you hit your target, very very nice... skins for the aircraft are also relatively easy too mod aside from the fact you have to have a higher setting for your editor so your skins don't look all pixely. CONSthis is where i get too undersand things, if you are not a avid or hard core flight simulator player like myself, you will probably NOT like this game, in hard mode the planes seem too be VERY difficult too fly, i understand the old war birds wherent easy too fly, but come on guys the DR-1 Fokker triplane could turn too the left without rapily jerking into a stall so easily, and its either you have this on and can perform coplex maneuvers that require a stall, or you turn it off and can hardly stall the plane at all to do spacific complex maneuvers, in CFS3 or FSX you could adjust the difficulty marginally and get used to the difficulty, i guess i was spoiled buy that? doing simple maneuvers such as the immelman turn, the barrel role, seem impossible, these aircraft seem too have the roll rate of a lead brick, especually at lower speeds, but even at higher i noticed once the aircraft seems to go inverted it just wants to stop rolling and it drops out of the sky, i have a feeling these aircraft really rolled faster than that as this was the erra maneuvers such as the Immelman turn, or the barrel role where conceved, and don't even start to get me going on the camera controls, they work really good when you only have 4 or 5 enemy planes in a formation, at the push of a button you can set your pilot too view your enemy looking straight at him from the cockpit, but when you are blistering buy everyone in a Spad XIII, its difficult too get a lock on one target too stay focused on it, you loose targets all the time and its REALLY frustrating, because suddenly as you click the button on your joystick your guy looks at a DR-1 Fokker that blistered buy with no intention of shooting you... this is frustrating when your 6 inches from the ground trying too keep track of how close you are too it and you cycle between a forward looking down the sights cockpit view, and looking right at your enemy, there appears no way too select one target out so you don't have this happen, once again something i was spoiled buy in several flight simulators i suppose. and lastly, why don't all the planes come with the game, why are there only 10 of the some 30-40 planes avalible too fly? and why do 4 of them cost some $25? i just got done paying $50 or so dollars for this game and we have all these issues that i don't have with a flight simulator that was made back in 2001...VERDICTi suppose i would recommend it too some avid flight sim players or obsessed gamers where thats all they do with there life is eat chips and play games, its fun and has good graphics, other than that if you are looking for a fun arcade style shooter flier, or are a beginner, i suggest staying away...

												ROF is a WW1 Airial combat simulator. The graphical qualities are very impressive, from the ground textures, to the battle damage. The flight dynamics are too very impressive. yet adjustable, via ingame settings, you can simplyfy the physics, meaning it becomes much harder to tip stall, or spin out of control. This game does require some practice before you get anywhere. My advice if you decide to make the great choice in purchasing this game, do the tutorials, and get head tracking. Head tracking (i use FreeTrack) makes this game so immersive, and it is almost a must have, it makes spotting where your enemy has goine, so much easier. It is so easy to get engrosed in this game, I have foud it both challenging, and fun, This is a MUST have simulator for any buddng pilot, or for any one whom thinks they too coulod be a WW1 fighter ace. Pitch your skill against talented AI, or exceptionally talented PvP combat.			"

												First thing first: This is a simulator, not an arcade game. It requires time to learn to flight properly, and it surely need a joystick. If it's your cup of tea, I recommend the game. The flight models are quite accurate, and the feeling of flying on a stringbox plane is really fun. Forget high G maneuvers, HUD and fly-by-wire. You need to learn to fly with the bottom of your pants, with few instruments and navigate by sight. The planes are fragile, and a too steep dive may overrev the engine or tear up the wings, even successfully landing back after a mission is a victory. The options include some flying helps, and fully configurable joystick response. There are three campaign, a training one and one for each side in the war. The multiplayer part seems good, but I still didn't try that skies.			"

												Rise of Flight is a World War 1 flight sim that is a game made for flight sim enthusiast's, thus the game tenders to a small audience and genre. The game upon start-up is a tad confusing for someone who has never really had a flight sim, but being a normal gamer I ventured into the unknown playing a quick match. After taking awhile to find the ""Start Mission"" button I was off. The game is visually stunning, even for me with a relatively old gaming rig. The detail to the airplane is stunning and really helps capture the feel of playing in one of these vintage aircraft, from the seat to the gunsight everything seems authentic and comes alive as you fly around and if you have any interest in airplanes this game takes you right in.For controls it really depends, the only thing I can say specifically is that you NEED a joystick. Its required to play unless you want to spend hours assigning controls to your mouse. Anyways, each plane has its own play style and handles differently. Some planes require more mastery of the controls to play than others. I found that for noobs the best planes to play are German, I found they were easier to control over the British and French planes.The Game has a couple of different modes, obviously a multi-player mode but it also has a campaign, quick match and Career mode. In Multi-player I feel as though everyone should know how it works but if not: All servers have their own maps and rules with differing difficulties meaning only so much help is given to you via onscreen gauges and auto managed engine controls. Usually the objective is to kill the enemy. Pretty basic. The campaign is (from what I gathered) just a bunch of missions with varying objectives, from intercept enemy fighters to attacking their bases. Finally my favourite mode: Career mode. In Career mode you get to choose from either Belgian, French, British or German careers (When you pick a side you are just picking a squadron from that nationality). Once you've selected what side you want to play for, you can change the date (Between September 1916, to December 1918) to get the aircraft you want, because they are available only during the time they were available during the war. Once you've done that you pick your name, age and background (E.G: I was a fisherman from New Foundland). Finally you get to play the game, the Career mode is connected to a server so you get to see leaderboards for overall scores, and people in your squadrons score. I personally like the feature, adds a bit more of a goal and sort of drives you a bit. The game also gives you a newspaper every week and its actually pretty fun to see the progression of the war in-game and on the right it has the top 50 aces and its cool to see how some keep passing the other. In Career mode you start off as the low of the low, a grunt pilot who gets assigned missions and you do em, but you get a bit of an option. In my first Career mode I decided that doing the missions were not eventful enough so I broke away from my flight and went off on my own to hunt down some Germans, I found 3 and killed them. Returning to base and finishing the flight I got awarded a Victoria Cross and a Military Cross, it was kinda cool to be awarded medals. Makes the game have even more of a goal. After a month of playing I now have him pretty high on the leaderboards. Sadly, the career mode allows for restarting the mission so I doubt many people in the top 100 have played fairly.One thing that is very angering is the selection of planes, there are around 8-10 base planes. I assume since the game isnt very popular, the dev's made it so that to get any more planes you have to pay for the packs. It wouldnt even be that bad if the packs didnt cost $25-$30. And you only get like 4 planes, a rip off but what can you do? I would personally like to be able to make my own combination of 4 planes and pay like $15. Seems more reasonable. The base planes are among the most popular like the ""Sopwith Camel"" and the ""Albatros"" so atleast you dont have to be at a disadvantage in multiplayer because they are good fighters, just sucks there is barely any variety.The learning curve for this game is not that bad, obviously its there and pretty hard but compared to DCS or IL2 its alot better because the planes are relatively simple, and if you really cant stand all the realistic settings you can switch em off which makes it much easier for people who could care less about learning the game and just want to shoot other planes. It caters to hardcore flight sim players and people just interested in World War 1 aviation.A couple of personal notes that I want to discuss: Multiplayer with friends is absolutely a ton of fun, playing seriously or just messing around; Its a ton of fun. The game allows for players to be in the same plane so you and a couple friends can all be in a bomber just having the laughs of your life or actually trying to win it for the team, either way its awesome. Although, the game as a lone wolf is a bit depressing. Even when trying my hardest the enemy always seems to best me in turning or diving, and no one ever really trys to back you up. Obviously some games people coordinate the team but most times its just Call Of Duty World War 1 planes. My final verdict is 8.5/10. The game looks amazing, has a pretty wide variety of missions and career mode is endless fun, Multiplayer can be hit or miss with some people and the lack of a variety with the planes kinda sucks. The core mechanics are solid and fluid and the game can be switched from super realistic to arcade style.			"

												Let me start with the following:*  I have owned this game for years and downloaded the Steam version specifically to make this review.  No idea why it is rated so poorly.*  You get 3 planes in the free edition.*  Buying more planes is the way this game is marketed.  If you use steam you get these through DLC, if you use the Rise of Flight store you can buy individual planes.  However one you use one of the other, you can only use that method.  I don't know why they did it this way but they did.  However complaining that a free game doesn't have all the planes available, not sure why anyone sees that as a valid complaint.  The free version is basically a demo with 3 planes, two of which are good, the other if a Nieuport.*  You will need at least a joystick, preferably with twist capability for rudder.OK, so that out of the way, if you're still interested then let me say that of all the flight sims I've played, this felt the most like I was flying.  Maybe it's because the planes are slow, basically gliders with engines, but it is an experience.  When you pull out of a dive and your wings catch lift you feel it in the pit of your stomach, you can practically feel the lift.  For your first time out, I'd suggest going with the German Albatros D.Va (name seems familiar somehow), or if you are down to slap down money out the gate, the Albatros II.  Do a quick mission with no enemies and start on the ground.  Take off is as easy as putting the throttle to max, using your rudder to keep yourself going straight, and letting the plane gently take off.  In fact these planes want to rise, so you'll need some downward for on the stick to prevent yourself from stalling, just enough to stay level and gently glide up.  Do a few circles around your base then land anywhere that you won't run into a tree or a building.  Just lay off the throttle and gently come down.  The plane will bounce, it may break, whatever you don't have to pay for it and you'll be on the ground!When you want a more advanced plane use the Spad (Spad XIII if free, Spad VII if you're paying).  You'll have to deal with engine management including radiator and fuel mix.  If you just want to shoot stuff then add a convoy to your instant flight and use the map/land recognition to find and destroy it.  Make sure you charge your guns first (you will need to charge them before they fire, no bullets, also they jam some times so keep the charge button handy on your stick).  When you are ready for air to air combat, set up one enemy, preferably something set to easy and of an earlier era.  Get used to manouvering.  Next thing you know you'll be buying a full HOTAS, rudder, and Track IR so you can really get into this sim.  It's easy enough, in the right planes (Albatrosses), that my friends who have barely any interest in flying find it fun (including girlfriends who don't play video games).  You'll also find many allied planes and some German planes to be unforgiving.  Hell some of them don't even fly right like the Dr.1 (Red Barrons triplane).  That thing takes a ton of rudder to manuever, but it's like a little floating deathball when you've got it down!  Then there are the giant 4 engine bombers that just barely get airborne, it's a challenge just getting off the ground, let alone making the bombing run!I highly recomend this sim to anyone who likes flight sims.  I haven't even touched the hand crafted campaigns or the autogenerated ones.  There are more maps, seaplanes, a few Russian ones are around now, tons of aircraft modifications.  It is a shame to see this sim voted so low on Steam, it deserves better.  If you've made it this far, download the game and see for yourself.  After all it's free to try, and you can do a lot with the planes you're given (well two of them anyway).			"

												I have been playing RoF since its release in 2009, and it has improved so much since `09, i love this game.Most people who have written give it a bad review because of the DLC, and yeah i can understand that, but what they don`t realize is that when you purchased the base game in `09 it came with +- 6-8 planes, 1 map, no single player campaign, etc etc.Then after 2-3 months the first 2 plane dlc would come out, and all the Rof folks would jump on it, because it adds to the game.Now if you start new.. then yeah you have a big amount of planes to buy, but its not a reason to give the game a bad review.For the game, I think it has the best damage engine in a flight sim to date, just taking off and diving back into the ground with time set to -10 is enough enjoyment to keep you busy for hours.I love the single player campaign, as it puts you as a rookie pilot in the middle of the war, and it lets you choose which period of the war, which side, which plane etc etc.Only thing i dislike is that you will not fly with the famous WW1 aces, you can encounter them in the air, but no matter how many times you fly with Jasta 11 you will not see Voss, Richthofen, or Udet..something that the game really needs.Also a issue for me is that when you switch squadrons the kill tally list is empty for the AI flyers..as if the war did not exist for them till you joined.But that's where for me the negative ends for this game.I will give this game AAA+ and recommend it to anyone that loves the period and flightsims, and i would advice getting the Base game and the Acepack to start with (i own the non steam game and steam game, but on steam i only have those 2 pieces of the package).If you wish to see me kicking a guy`s♥♥♥♥♥♥in Multiplay check the video.

												I find this a really interesting and very cool game, the game it self just being based in WWI is a very rare find as WWII hogs the show for the most part. The pros of this game would be fantastic graphics stunning physics and the AI will have you clinching your ""ehhem"" buttocks everytime an enemy flier gets on you. Cons being DLC is on the high end, but hey if you want such high quality stuff you gotta pay premium and the fact that this game is bought almost exlusivly by hardcore simmers makes a difference in the price.

												It's the best in its class. You want to feel what it's like flying a wooden coffin with paper wings and wind rushing your face? Look no further. After mastering a few aircrafts, you'll feel like a pro keeping your plane airborne without any autopilot or trimming systems. Trying to score a kill is another story. While a daunting task to be proficient, you'll forget about some of the frustration and marvel at the gorgeous French and English scenery at 3000m altitude without any parachute to save you if something goes wrong. Recommended for fans of flight sims who want something different than WW2 or modern fighters.			"

												If you are into realistic flight simulators or early 20th century history I'd totally recommend this sim for you. The flight model of this game is realistic as you're gonna get, especially in a WW1 flight sim which there aren't a lot of. The sim is also a lot of fun if you emmerse yourself in the community, after all online play in this requires team work to get objectives done, but also team work inside an aircraft as in communication between pilot and gunners. However do expect everything to be quite hard core. This sim is not going to hold your hand on almost anything, but that's a challange and I like it a lot. So if you are looking for a quick round of arcade pew pew at other planes, just forget it. Don't start playing this and post a bad review after 10 minutes of play. This sim requires patience and love or respect for the planes in this particular time in history.Also I'd like to point out I'm disappointed with all the negative reviews for this. People seem to completely misunderstand this simulator, as well as it's business model. People complain that everything is expensive and the free base of the game doesn't offer enough. Well guess what, in the free game you have 3 planes. When this game was still payed that was about the same amount of content you got for the base package. My point is, be glad you can play this for free at all. As for the other paid content, the devs put A LOT of effort in making all the planes and content as realistic as they can which takes a lot of time and money. The price is totally fair, especially during steam sales when they are a total steal. If you don't want to spend any money on quality content, fine, but don't post bad reviews because you're too salty to appreciate anything.			"

												I generally avoid writing reviews for games, but after checking out this game's store game based on the name change to ""Rise of Flight United"" rather than ""Rise of Flight"", I saw this game's rating has plummetted since I played it 9ish months ago. How can this be? Based upon reading the reviews, a bunch of people installed the game now that it's free and proceeded to trash it with negative reviews, which I guess is understandable considering that this game appeals to a niche audience. If you're the type of person that enjoys a high-fidelity, historical flight sim that demands a joystick and patience, this game is for you. If you can appreciate that to play the game without any computer assistance you need to learn how to monitor your engine's fuel mixture, this game is for you. If the career mode, in which you follow your own pilot (replete with a nice narrative via his biography) throughout the war as you rack up victories and medals and eventually command your own squadron, this game is for you. If you're going to install this game because you see that it's free, there's a good chance it isn't for you. Please try it; that's why the devs made it free. In the free version you can access the game in full and decide whether or not its a right fit for you. If it isn't, just move on. But don't be like justmeman117, who after less than two hours gave it a negative review and ranted for at least that long about the game's marketing.Of course, that said, this game really does have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ marketing, and I regret sinking so much money into the steam version. Last year I spent probably $70 on the paid game and stupid dlc packs which left me with a mish mash of campaigns, planes, and dumb crap like streamers for my plane and coloured scarves for my pilot, when all the while the game could be downloaded free on riseofflight.com. To add insult to injury, you used to be able to buy all the game's content for $50 via their website, an option that's no longer available. If you're reading this, I suggest you refrain from playing or paying via steam for this game and go straight to the source.Of course, despite all that this game is still fantastic, and it scratches an itch and serves a niche like no other game. Flying above the French countryside is beautiful, looking down at no-man's land from the clouds is an impresive experience, and combat is  visceral, intense, and incredibly rewarding. Probably the most dramatic, nail-biting episode in any video game I've ever played was my epic duel with a French Ace in career mode, and my triumphal yell upon scoring my first kill was deafening. One of my all time favorites, and don't let the torrent of pouty reviewers dissuade you if you think this is your sort of game. Just try it; it's free! Sort of...			"

												I have been playing this game for a few yrs. now off of Steam and decided to purchase the Steam Version in order to take advantage of the DLC packs.

												Rise of Flight is an amazing Flight Combat Simulator, that can burn many hours in a beautiful rendered WW1 era Europe (and London if you get the add-on).  It is not only one of my absolute favorite Flight Combat simulator games that I own. The aircraft are very detailed, and seem to accurately depict the flight models, giving you an immersive feeling of how they flew.  Some of the models are dead on from some of the blueprints and documents I had researched on my own time.I must admit, at first I was not sold on the idea of Bundles for planes and paying 15-30 USD per pack (or if you go and buy from the website, a couple of dollars an airplane).  After I tried it out, flew a few quick matches...I wanted to give it a go with the Early Years Pack, it was on sale for 7 USD from Steam.  What keeps this game and the community thriving, is that we as Simulator Enthusiasts/Collectors of Airplanes...want these planes, and those that want them, pay or invest into the airplane(s).The Single Player Career mode is quite awesome, and can be a lot of fun, actually participating (or as close as we can get) in the dogfights over war torn Europe.  It has a pretty cool score keeping system, that shows all of the pilots across the world, and where you stand in comparison (and scored by difficulty).  What about Multiplayer you ask???  The biggest plus for this game, is the on-line battles.  Huge maps, multiple object based maps, that can last anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours.  The biggest and best thing about the on-line is that the planes you had invested in, can most of the time be available to fly for your nation...while the free-to-try planes are descent, there is nothing like having a favorite plane to go out and fight (or BOMB) with.  As if that wasn't cool enough, the servers (even when you leave the server and come back the next day) keep track of your ""Kill Streak or Bombing/Destroying of Ground Targets"".  As long as you do not die or get captured over enemy lines, that streak continues just as if you were a real pilot...giving this game an added feel that other Combat Simulators have not quite had.I do apologize for the massive review, but I just say...it is for sure worth a go since it is ""Free-To-Play"" and if you are into great in your face Dogfights, then this game is a great option.  If you do end up buying the packs...feel free to join the on-line community (US Server Wargrounds) and get ready to have a blast.			"

												Having played this game since 2011 before it came to Steam, and before it was even free-to-play, I think it’s a great WW1 aviation simulator and really no other games come even remotely close to rendering this period of aviation in the way that Rise of Flight does. Performance and PlayabilityWhen the game first released there was the typical optimization issues and ‘will my pc run it question’. But now through refinements and as hardware has moved on it does play really well and I encountered no issues personally as of writing this (Game runs fine for me on Windows 10). NOTE: You are required to create a straight forward in-game account to play this.Aircraft SelectionThere is close to 40 aircraft included in the game consisting of fighters, recon, bombers and attack planes. Three of these can use without purchasing (Nieuport 17.C1 RUS, Albatros D.Va and SPAD 13.C1, which are all single seater biplane fighters). These can be modified with different weapons, additional cockpit gauges and paint schemes that all varies from plane to plane.

The flight models are really well done, and makes for a really challenging experience on realistic simulation settings, and equally satisfying when you manage to shoot down an opposing aircraft, or even just survive a sortie. As learning curves go, these are some of the hardest planes to fly, but a really interesting period of aviation. NOTE: Don't forget to grab the official skin-pack located here[rof.s3.amazonaws.com] as it doesn't appear to be included in the base download.Free to play limitsThe game being currently 'Free-to-play', which means you can install the game and fly a few well-known aircraft without even having to purchase anything. There is around 35 additonal planes you can own with various purchases - but these are not required to enjoy the game unless you specifically wish to fly them. Planes you don't own will show up fine in Missions and you can play people online okay as-well.  Overall I don't consider current prices that expensive, when you compare to other Flight Simulators these are a lot cheaper and you could likely buy several aircraft for the less than you would of spent on a non free-to-play title. This does let you pay for the content you actually want, rather than paying full price for the base game, then having to buy addons on top. MultiplayerThe multiplayer used is not through Steam, however to simply join via in-game seemed quite straight forward and was quickly in the air flying missions, you can also host via in-game easy enough. A dedicated server on the other hand, while included is not that straight forward on how to even set it up and after long winded searches with mere snippets of information I was unable to test this. Free Flight (Quick Missions)In quick missions this is where you can setup quick engagements of a few types and specify a number of parameters easily for quick instant action gameplay for up to 30 aircraft. You are able to define the aircraft of 3 friendly and 3 enemy flights, including their formation (and number of aircraft in the formation), paint scheme, weapons and skill level. In some locations you can also choose to start on the ground and scramble start as enemy approach.This mode is a good way to test the ability of your chosen aircraft, as you can choose to go against any aircraft you wish, including ones you haven’t purchased.Missions & CampaignsThere is a few scripted missions included that will work with 2 of the included free aircraft (SPAD 13.C1 and Albatros D.Va), as well as a training campaign. There is a mission editor external to the game.CareerThe career mode is a dynamic campaign but quite restricted without purchasing more aircraft. This is simply down to the fact most squadrons would change aircraft several time during the war and you would need all these planes for when they are each used. If you have all the required aircraft for the squadron you wish to join (which could be French, German, Belgian or British), then career mode is a great game-mode that will offer countless hours of interest (and to be quite honest, is the main reason I play this so much).HINT: If you want to try Career mode with just the free to play aircraft, then select a time period of very early 1918, the French will be using the SPAD 13.C1 and Germans using the Albatros D.Va with select squadrons.

												Not an easy game and not very friendly to starters. But once you learn the basics Its very fun. Small things like shooting down an enemy, Bombing a target, or even fancy things like becoming an ACE feel so rewarding. The game is great for anyone who seeks a challenge in gaming. Go get a joystick if you don't have one and pick up this game.ONE IMPORTANT THING THOUGH! It's a great game but the DLC can cost a lot. Buy the DLC only when its on sale, It's worth getting but with only 4 new planes per DLC pack you may want to wait it to be cheaper before buying...			"

												As it says in the promotional video - this is the most realistic WW1 flight sim out there. I fly irl and I can say that this feels very realistic.After a lot of thinking, I've only found 2 downsides for this game: the rudder control is poor (I use keyboard - maybe a twisting joystick wouldn't be so bad); and there is only a *very* limited number of planes that you can fly without paying any money.As a kind-of third downside (which is only a downside because of how realistic it is), there is a long flight before getting into a firefight in campaign mode. However, autopilot and time acceleration make short work of the potential boredom.			"

												There is a lot of negitivity about the game but I don't get it. I love the game, yes it gets expensive if you want more then two or whatever planes but I thinks its money well deserved to the developers. I mean It's free to play so you can try it out first. The game does require patience, but that is because this is a really acurate sim with a lot of just flying mixed with some guns, crashes and other satisfying things that are only magnified by the repetitive things.

												This game is the #1 WW1 Flight simulator in the world!!! Its career could literally take up to 3 years if you finish 1 mission per day. The planes are easy to fly. This game supports Eyefinity and track IR support. The DLC's are worth it and people complain that it's $200 for them all. If you want them cheaper, just wait till the next sale or do some Steam Trades, simple. Look at the high quality modeling that goes into the plane models. As a modeler myself, and it would take me almost 1 weeks just for 1 plane model and each DLC gives you four of them. Look at Train simulator 2015, it has $4,000 worth of DLC's and DCS where they give you only 1 plane per DLC for the same price as ROF and they are not that good. So... Is it worth it (on sale or retail)?-Most definitely!Should i get the DLC's-YES! just wait till they go on sale if you can wait a while or steamtrades.Should i read the negative reviews?-If you want. They mostly complain about the DLC's because they ""cost too much"" and they can’t wait for it to go on sale. As I always say, ""the longer you wait, the cheaper it will get.""			"

												Great World War One flying. Great flight models and graphics. I also had the  non-steam version for years, and had many hours of enjoyment with it. You need to actually know how to fly. Don't expect to jump right in unless you are already a seosoned flight simmer, although I think there is a new mouse mode for you War Thunder types. I don't know how well it works I never tried it. It's marketed as a free to play game on here for some strange reason. It is really is more of a demo. You will need to spend money to get full enjoyment from this. Shocking stuff, I know. Don't believe most of the negative reviews unless you are a broke kid or an imbecile.  Most of the negative reviews seem to be either, they can't believe they have to pay for anything in life, or they can't figure out that you have to register your DLC key on the 777 website for them to work. If you fit into one of those 2 categories then I suggest you look elsewhere.			"

												Oh what  a shame.On a purely mechanical standpoint this game is fantastic. I've played dozens of flight sims over the last twenty+ years and this is one of the lucky few that actually gives you the sensation of flying. The physics are stunning, the damage model is great and it's a lot of fun just cruising around getting acquainted with the planes, so why don't I recommend it?As countless people have mentioned before this game is somewhat of a scam. You get a tiny tiny selection of planes and scenarios which would be alright if this was advertised as a demo. If you want anything more you'll have to pay for ridiculously overpriced DLC packs that are so convoluted you'll need a literal flowchart for them. I'm not kidding, check the community guides! So, just play this as a demo and hope that the developer goes broke and gets bought by a different company with respect for their costumers.			"

												The steep learning curve brings you to great heights! Totally worth the effort. Joystick is a must and TrackIR or anything like it is recommended. My joystick could be better, but I'm still having fun with it. Sometimes I really feel the lack of a tracking system like TrackIR. Looking around with my joystick button is faster than using my mouse, but it's a bit annoying from time to time. Anyway, the immersive gameplay is brilliant!The beautiful sound of your starting engine, controlling your mixture and/or radiator, orientating using only the map and your eyes, it's captivating. It makes you feel in control, feel connected to the charming technology of a past era. Shooting down an enemy is one thing, getting back to base in one piece (or at least being able to land) is another. I like the game very much, because more than in any other simulator you spend a lot of time keeping your plane in the air while orientating yourself. If you play it on full realism, that is.Buy it on sale, it's worth the 23 euros (at the moment). Decide which extra planes you want and buy the DLC that have them included. Every planes behaves differently, and once you fall in love (or already are in love) with a certain plane, you will crash and die a lot with it, while laughing your pants off.Don't be scared by the learning curve, I'm a mediocre player and I'm able to have fun with it. If you love WW1 planes, buy this game with the money you would have spent on food and just live on water and bread for a week. If you're tempted, don't resist. If you hate it, you should ask yourself why you visited the store page of this game, and buy it anyway.			"

												What don't seem to realize is that Rise of Flight on Steam is a demo. You get 3 planes and and access to the full game. The three planes you get are the German Albatross D.Va, the French SPAD XIII, and the Russian Nieuport 17 (which is actually French). The Albatross and SPAD are actually very good planes ( I personally am not a fan of the Nieuport, but hey you might like it). The lack of servers and players is because the game is from 2009, it was only added to Steam in 2013. If you enjoy WWI aviation, this sim is for you. This is a flight sim, not a game. Therefore, you are really going to want a joystick. If you play with mouse you're doing it wrong and it won't be particularly enjoyable.However, the game still has an active community, even if it's small. The servers are fairly populated on weekends and weekdays at around 12-6PM EST. I recommend you go to Rise of Flight's website when buying aircract, as you can get the packs or buy individual planes. If you buy a two-seater, your friend could be your gunner if he didn't want to fly or vice versa.This game gets negative reviews because people expect a COMPLETELY free flight sim. I don't see why, as they are getting 3 planes and the entire game for free. If you want a good singleplayer experience, play the career mode. If you want a good multiplayer experience, hop on the ""New Wings Wargrounds"" server when it has around 15 people on (it can have up to around 60 people on at once).In conclusion, Rise of Flight is by far one of the best flight sims you can get your hands on. It takes you back to the early years of flight when dogfighting was a completely new thing. People need to understand that a game with as much content and depth as this is not going to be completely free. If money is really an issue, wait until planes and packs are on sale as you can get them for extremely cheap. Hope I helped. "

												I would definitely recommend this game! I've owned the non-Steam version for about 4 years now and have loved every minute of it. :) This is THE World War I flight sim, ladies and gents. But be warned! This game has a steep learning curve. If the life expectancy for real WW1 pilots was as bad as 10-15 days in some cases, don't expect that becoming a fighter Ace will be easy for you. However, once you've mastered a few skills, there is no greater feeling. I would also venture to say that as you gain experience, becoming a better pilot gets much easier. So don't give up if your first few times up in the wild blue yonder end as abysmal failures! For those who keep trying, there really is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. ;) Also, keep in mind that this is a detailed flight simulator, so if you're looking for a quick ""shootem' up"" style plane game, this probably won't be up your alley. But, if you are looking to be immersed in the world of World War I aviation and experience the sensation of flight for yourself, this is most definitely your game. One final note. A lot of newer players who download the free to play version on Steam don't understand how it works, get frustrated, and give up. This doesn't have to be you! In order to help newer pilots understand how to set up Rise of Flight and get the most out of the free content, I wrote this Steam guide here:

Summary:This is a gem of a flight simulator. It is highly atmospheric and the aircraft all have a good individual feel to them. It is a lot of fun and conveys a great sense of the air conflict over the trenches of the First World War. The free-to-play version comes with 3 great aircraft, although there is a bit of a learning curve to get started.Cautions: The Steam version of the game and the Rise of Flight Store version can not be mixed, you need to go one route or the other. Both variants can participate in all the multiplayer servers though. The free-to-play version has 3 aircraft enabled: SPAD C13, Albatros D.Va and Nieuport 17. Many new players get confused by picking campaign dates or multiplayer maps for which these aircraft are not valid. Some multi-player servers have full-engine realism enabled, making it tricky for newcomers to figure out how to switch on the engine and get started. It is not hard, but you do need to check the manual/guides/videos to find out how. Steam achievements do not work. This is very disappointing for those of us who enjoy the Steam achievement system. While mouse-and-keyboard play are possible to get started, a joystick is strongly recommended.Full review:Rise of Flight is a flight-simulator for the First World War. The atmospheric is great and the graphics are lovely, albeait a little dated now. There is a good selection of aircraft and a reasonable range of multiplayer servers and scenarios to keep you enthralled. The base game is free-to-play, and there are two ways to purchase add-ons: either through Steam (with DLCs) or the Rise of Flight Store (with individual items). You cannot mix the two methods (I went with the Steam option).It is not an arcade game, but should be treated as a serious simulator. As such, there are a lot of keys to map, and a lots of things to learn. We often see newcomers turn up and have trouble figuring out how to start their aeroplane or take off (tip: search on the Internet for videos on getting started in Rise of Flight).The setting is compelling and there are a range of weathers, times of day, maps and settings. Targets are many and varied and there is a great selection of aircraft to fly against, from bombers to scouts to seaplanes. The aircraft seem fragile and occasional gun jams, mechanical failures and a rough feel enhance the title. This is the only sim where I've managed to suspend disbelief and truly feel in the environment.There are some flaws (see the cautions above), but these are minor compared to the many features offered by the rest of the sim. In total, if you purchase all the modules, it can be pretty expensive. But you can either be selective (like me) or wait for sales or discounts. One recommended DLC for those who go with the Steam version is the Channel Battles, as it adds the English Channel Map (excellent) and a great selection of fine aircraft.Despite its age and somewhat confusing purchase model, this is nonetheless a worthy simulator and comes highly recommended.

												Rise of Flight is a ""free to play"" flight simulator that has many paywalls. It worked on Win 10, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok.    This realistic flight simulator is going back to the basics of air combat in world war 1.  The Free to Play accounts are only able to play the Training Campaign, Quick Missions and Career missions that use the free planes and maybe the multiplayer rooms.  By default, the flight controls are on easy mode, but if you want more realistic model, you can make changes.  For This game you really need flight joysticks to get the most out of this simulator.The tutorial is in the Campaigns under Training Campaign. Recommend that you read the manual, do the tutorials  and look for wiki and guides.  If you pick Quick Mission, you have to pick out the 3 planes that you own. In the plane list, you find the planes that have a solid picture and no tag symbol is the planes you own. The planes that you have to buy is transparent and has a white tag with asterick in right corner. I think the devs should look into changing that to auto-picking the first plane that the player owns for the quick missions.   This game has Similiar business model to DCS World.Try it, if you like realistic WW1 flight simulators, but this game is a Pay to Play game.For more info:

												A brilliant WW1 flight simulator, there's a lack of WW1 games in general at the moment, let alone flight sims, but luckily we have this one. The game has brilliant physics, the planes are well modeled and pretty cheap to buy for a flight sim, you can SHOOT OTHER PILOTS IN THE FACE WITH PISTOLS FROM YOUR OWN PLANE! There's also a great community of modders on their official forums, where you can download free Historically accurate & fictional skins for all the planes.If you're planning on downloading it F2P style, I highly recommend you buy the 'Channel Battles' DLC, as the base F2P game is more of a platform for buying planes & DLC, whilst the 'Channel Battles' DLC adds a good selection of classic planes (Including my personal favourites, the SE.5a & Felixstowe F2a), a whole new region to fly in and a Career mode. Well worth the price.The game also supports Keyboard + Mouse flight, which is actually quite good for newcomers/non Joystick owners.Overall I give it a 9/10.

												Most negative reviews center around the fact that you have to pay for additional planes, which I find a bit strange because you already get a state-of-the-art sim with 3 great planes for free ! Every plane is meticulously modeled and I think it's fair that the developpers get something in return for their hard work, don't you think ? And if you wait for a sale, I think it starts to become a no brainer ...I only recently got into this sim and I must say I am very impressed. The way this sim conveys the feeling of true flight is really very convincing. As an avid flight simmer (FSX, Prepar3d, Xplane, DCS, Falcon BMS, ...you get the picture) and RW professional pilot I think IMHO this sim has nailed it on all accounts : very realistic flight and damage modelling, deep ""systems"" modelling (as far as it goes for WWI), graphics are very nice for a DX9 engine, performance on my rig (4670k / GTX980Ti) is excellent (lots of options to tweak), and general immersiveness is top notch. IMHO, I think compared to modern era aerial warfare, WW1 dogfights lend themselves better to PC flight simming with its inherent hardware limitations due to the relatively lower speeds and closer engagement ranges. It's the ideal platform to learn all about dogfight tactics and manoeuvres...In short, for all flight sim and WW1 aviation enthusiasts looking for a realistic old-fashioned stick and rudder experience, this is simply a must have !...Oh yes, one more thing, I had an issue with the activation of some DLC (I forgot I had two different accounts and erroneously activated my DLC on my non-steam account) and the support team helped me out extremely fast, I was impressed...again !

												First and foremost, this is a flight sim - and it is not free to play. Just so you understand going into it, similar to a flight sim like DCS world, you get the game engine and one or two planes that you can fly for free. Other planes you have to purchase. Also, like other flight simulation games, this game is complex and you will need a flight stick at a minimum to really enjoy it. Beyond that, it's a great sim. The flight mechanics feel good, the graphics are great and the dogfights are a lot of fun. If you're a flight sim fan this is a game for you. If you're looking for a more arcade-style flight game like war thunder, this isn't for you.			"

												This game is just amazing. The physics are something truely awesome. The graphics in game are good while allowing some more minor computers able to run the game. This game is a very detailed and realistic flight sim based around the WW1 Era that beats any other flight sim out there. The player community is very helpful and friendly. They will tell you how to get airborne and get to killing planes. Most of the negative reviews are because of the need to buy 95% of the planes in the game. I also find it rather rubbish that it cost so much, but I mean that is how most F2P game companies get their money. The only planes you start out with is a british biplane, a Rus biplane, and a german biplane. Now you can play with a mouse and keyboard, but is highly recommended to play with a flight stick and a track Ir. Overall, the mechanics, the graphics, hardware requirements, playerbase, I give this game a 9.5/10. (If you want to tell me how to improve more of my reviews, please do so in the comments. Be nice and not an A.hole.)			"

												Great game but far to expensive for new planes IMO. You get a small number of planes to start with and then they sell several plane packs, some of them are like £20.00 for about 3 planes!! There is no option to unlock more planes through progress, only payment. You might want to consider Warthunder for free at least you can easly unlock pretty much all teir 1 and 2 planes without too much grinding and you have the option to spend money on stuff if you want.  If you must have WW1 planes and don't mind spending upwards of £30.00 to get started up with a few to try, then stick with Rise of Flight, it is a really unique flying experience although you will need a joystick to play the game. The dogfights can be a lot of fun especially in multiplayer and it is a joy to take off and fight then bring back a partially damaged flying boat. I hear that most players benefit from TrackIR or Freetrack so they can get better viewing angles like over the side of the cockpit. You can even hop into some of the bigger planes in a gunners position in multiplayer which is damn awesome, especially with yr buddies on comms.  If you are on the wall about buying the game then check out some Youtube videos, there are some pretty awesome battles too see.  If you have a good flight stick and TrackIR/FreeTrack and enjoy attention to detail and good flight models then it's a no brainer, just get the game already.			"

												Way back in the day I played Knights of the Sky. Since then there has really been nothing that captures the danger, and pure randomness of WW1 aviation. Until now. The game can be as boring, or as exciting as you'd like. For a free-to-play game, you actually get quit a bit of content.For those who say 'you can't access career mode on free-to-play' -you're wrong. All you have to do is simply select a time from and squadron that has the aircraft that you've unlocked. You get 3 free aircraft and you can play in career mode during the times that these aircraft were available. If you want an entire career, you have to purchase the relevant aircraft. These are the paywalls. But, it's fair enough. I did end up purchasing a pack, because I wanted to start my career earlier in the war..The learning curve is quite daunting if you're going for a simulator type playthrough, but there is a tutorial mode in the campaign section. There are toggles for difficulty, or just plain convenience.  I do have my gripes though. Menu function is pants-on-head ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and the rosters / reports and flight debreifings aren't in depth enough to satisfy me, although I do believe there are mods for this. There's also a lot of 'staying in formation' and not much action. You can go missions without a single dogfight - but maybe that's historically how it went? I don't know. Not one of my careers has lasted more than 2 weeks. I mostly die because of physics, or AA or collision -  seldom from and enermy pilot.Graphically, it's kind of dated, but not THAT bad. It serves it's purpose and everything represents what it should. Well worth your time if you enjoy flying, simulation type games or a decent challenge.			"

												Hi , An Old Pilot ,not a Bold Pilot.  The Sopwith Camel is excellent sim aircraft with real world stall/spin aircraft performance. The stall is preceded with aircraft shaking on the edge of a stall... then it lets loose to develop into a full blown gyro lock spin if the pilot does not act, the Camel will lock into a unrecoverable spin. It is the best SIMS Spin in the industry and recovery is ify,  you can not use standaed stall recovery in puts. The gyro lock must be prevented by forcing the camels nose down ; this is accomplished by pulling the nose up then down , nose up then push nose down and hold if the nose droppes positive toward ground.... then hold nose down and recover with hands off stick.  It helps to switch eng off throttle ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ .  Positive speed and lift eng on throttle advanced.  It takes a few tries and helps to view the aircraft from  F2 view. Good Luck.			"

												If you are a flight simmer and interested in WW1, there is no way around this game/simulation.Pros:- Flight physics- Immersion (Overall mixture of graphics, sound, flight model, world, makes up for a believable flying experience)- Damage model- Variety of available aircraft (With DLC'S)- Aircraft details and customisation- World details and behaviour- Sound- Multi Monitor support- Career modeNeutral:- Equipment needed(I bought this game like three years ago. I couldnt enjoy it with just one or two screens. Since i got a third...its simply a blast to play. I need a large field of view or I cant keep track of my opponents. And I want to see the passing landscape below my wings. You will need a flight stick (pref. HOTAS) and pedals are a nice addition)Cons:- Enemies despawn in front of the player, if they get too far away from your flight leader.- DLC's and price politics are confusing.If you buy here on steam, you cant use the original online shop and vice versa. Or so i have been told.Available career starting dates depend if you have the historical correct plane available for that time window.If you buy a dlc you get maybe one or two planes that you want and need for your carreer and two or more that you did not want, but paid for anyway.Just as an example:German carreer from 1916:The most interesting plane to start with would be:Fokker IIIE --> You need the Birth of warbirds DLCAfter just 3 weeks in career the Fokker is obsolete and you want the:Albatros DII --> You need the Bloody April DLCWhich is followed by the:Albatros DIII --> You need the Furious Wings DLCIf you want to obtain later on the most powerful engine for the Fokker D.VII:Fokker D.VIIF --> You need the Ultimately the Best Fighter DLCYou see. To play the german carreer from beginning to end, you will probably buy 4 DLC's. You can work around some of the dlc's by choosing less powerful or popular planes. But anyway, it would be way more customer friendly if you could buy one dlc with all the planes from one country.But still. My verdict is that this game offers tons and tons of content and a superb flight feeling for a reasonable price! The planes and dlcs go regularly on sale and large junks of the carreer can be played with the planes that are for free. So there is no excuse. Hop in and give it a try.			"

												 Rise of Flight is easily one of, if not the best flight sim I have ever played.  It even shows in the negative comments, you don't see many negative comments about the gameplay, you see negative comments lamenting the fact that you have to pay to get more planes.  This is not misadvertizement on the publisher's end, as the game says it is free to play, not free to own every plane in it, and the description of the game lays out the three free planes you get.  Now that I've denfended the game in that respect, let's talk about the many great features RoF has to offer.  It has an incredibly extensive library of planes, and, with any kind of simulator--farm, flight, or train, youo will be paying for the extra content.  But it is more than worth it.  The DLC regularly goes on sale for 66% off which means that you can get a pack of nine planes and a whole new map for $9-10, in reference to the Channel Battles DLC, which I would reccommend getting first as it gives a huge variety of planes, many of which are featured on  multiplayer maps, such as the stellar Fokker Dr. VII and Felixstowe F2.a which is flyable on the Inspiration Island multiplayer map.  It is a flying boat with the capacity to carry two 230-ish pond bombs and is, by far, one of the most fun planes to fly in the game.  Let it be noted, however, that the feld and weapons modifications must be purchased in the ""Ace Pack,"" which is one small gripe I have.        The graphics, sound, and physics are all absolutely wonderful--even on low settings the planes and landscape look quite good, you wouldn't expect this game to be as old as it is.  Physics can be adjusted, as can ease of piloting, which can be expected wiht any simulator.  The menu is laid out well and makes sense, and there are extensive biographies and specs for all the planes that are pretty spot-on for accuracy (and yes, I have cross referenced many of them).  You can do campaigns, careers, multiplayer, and quick battles.  Quick battles are especially fun because you can put 30 planes in the air and stage an end-all dogfight.  Before we move on, though, let's talk about multiplayer.  This is one of the most fun games to play with friends.  You have very realistic physics and even better damage models.  Crashes are, for the lack of a better word, sublime, and you will have hours of fun messing with your friends and playing back mission  logs on the built-in movie recorder.  So this game gives you a lot more opportunity than you would think for free.        I have invested in a lot of DLC and my friend has invested in none.  We still have a blast playing it together though, even if he only has the three planes.  It's a great game to play with friends and mess around with that quickly turns into a very real and exciting experience that you want to invest in.  Having all the DLC planes just gives you something else to fly, it doens't change the game that much at all.         The bottom line is this: you can tell that a lot of care and hard work went into this game by a relatively small team.  They have made the game free to play as a demo that offers you every single feature of the game except for the Channel Map and all the other planes.  You can get hours of enjoyment just flying the Albatros D V.a around in a quick game shooting at other planes (you can fly against any plane in the game in a quick match, you just can't pilot them yourself).  I know I sound like a fanboy, but I have a real passion for aviation and flight simulators, and this one is incredible.  So to see it getting bad ratings just because players can't have the 60 or so planes that the game offers for free agitates me slightly.  This game has a lot to offer, whether you want to invest in it or not.  So I encourage you to give it a try--it truly is as close to perfect I've seen a WWI flight sim get.  Happy flying :) Note: As the page says, once you have installed the Steam version of this game on your computer, you cannot use the version off of the Rise of Flight website and vice-verse.  There is a great forum on that website, by the way that can probably answer any questions you may have about the game.  As far as performance goes, I play this on my mid-range laptop with an Intel i7 processor that clocks in at about 2.5 Gz and two integrated graphics cards-- a Radeon m335 and an Intel R HD 520, both of which are not too special.  I run the game with all settings high except for render disntance, HRD, textures filtering and antialiasing which are lower and I get anywhere from  23-30 fps.			"

												A great many people have ripped this game apart because of it's payment method. Frankly, I like it. I owned RoF years ago, standalone (non-steam) and even though my laptop BARELY ran it, it stuck with me. When I saw that it was available on steam as a free-to-try, I knew I had to see what it would do on my brand new custom gaming PC. I am ok with the idea of trying a somewhat neutered full version of a game, and then paying for the modules I want. Yeah, when compared to the old days of IL-2, Combat Flight Sim, and the Jane's simulations, where you pay for the full program up front, and get all the content - no questions asked it seems a bit ridiculous. But to me, I see a major quality difference in a program like this. I paid $25 for the Channel Battle add-on, that seemed to bring the free version up to par with what would have been the in-store box edition years ago...that I paid i think $40 for. The planes really feel like what I would expect from them, judging from what I have read. I think that in todays simming age, so much more attention is paid to each individual aircraft, instead of a select few...I remember Microsoft Flight Sim 98, the first one to include virtual cockpits. The cessna 172s, and a couple others had it...but the boeing was a literal grey cardboard cutout you sat behind with NO gauges or anything. That was what your hard earned money got you. In ROF, you pay for each plane, but from what I can tell, they give the same thought and attention to detail to each plane in the lineup, so you get same type of experience in each seat. I like it, If you like the IL-2 installments, you'll like it too.			"

												I really want to like this game, but it feels quite a bit like a ""bait and switch."" I got one free DLC when I purchased the game, but I have not been able to figure out which missions I can fly since they are dependent on you buying the planes in order to play existing missions.			"

												Initially, my review was negative. But thanks to a handy tip, I'm now happy. I'm leaving the review up so you who have the same trouble as I did can see the answer:If you are using a widescreen monitor (my resolution is 1440 x 900), you will be unable to register your game.Additionally, within the game, there are menu items at the bottom of the screen THAT WILL BE UNAVAILABLE to you. Important things, like Keys Activation and Options, because the game will automatically size them off your screen.This fix is outlined below.			"

												This game really deserves a much higher rating - most of its negative reviews are from people either complaining about the DLC price structure, or having technical difficulties with their activation scheme. I had no issues with either of the above as I waited for a sale, activation was simple, and I am very happy with my purchases.			"

												Overall a good flight sim, althought I think the EIII is much more maneuverable then it should be, especially when given an AI novice pilot.Sounds could be better.. the MGs are drowned out by the engine noise and I have not seen any seperate volume sliders for effects, engine, etc..A good range of options like autorudder, aiming help, autopilot, easy flight, etc.. to help pilots get used to the aircraft.Would be nice to have a ""batch"" discount for all aircraft to be included instead of nickle and diming each one. I waited for a discount sale on the addons and got 4 of them. Without discount all the STEAM addons would have been quite expensive. I remember RB3D had more planes and was far cheaper.. around $40 when it was released. Now its on STEAM for far less and if you have a Glide wrapper the graphics are fairly good for an old title.For a more modern version of RB3D this ROF title is a reasonable move up for graphics, reasonable authenticity, and interface. If they made a batch sale for all aircraft and addons I think it would get a lot more attention, especially considering it is already several years old.Overall I do recommend it since you can play it with a few planes for free and then decide which addons to purchase from there.Thanks.

												If you are looking for an airplane game, stay away from ROF.Now, if you are looking for a faithful representation of WW1 air combat experience, get ready to be amazed.The term ""Free to Play"" is to be taken loosely, consider it a ""sample version"".You don't have to have all planes either, just the ones you care to fly.The cost of plane packages is not high if you take into account the amount of work each one has, but still, you can get amazing deals if you wait for offer season.Now, this is a ""one of a kind"" sort of sim. Very detailed, not a ""full procedure"" sim as DCS (airplanes start with the push of a button, although you can see the actual start procedure in the cockpit), but you do have to manage the engine completely.The behaviour of the planes is very realistic, damage models are very precise, making battles a cinematic wonder in some cases. All natural forces are replicated, from wind to gravity, exceedingly high speeds will rip your plane appart, damaged wing may suffer from stress and detach easily, and you can even try your last resort and pull your Luger out and attempt a more...""personal approach"".Although it has training and campaigns, this is more dedicated towards sorties and online play (don't disregard the campaigns though'!)This is not an experience that holds your hand through learning how to fly, you are expected to do some research appart from the sim, but this is an excelent entry point for the flight sim enthusiast, as cockpits are much simpler than newer flying machines (WW2 and later).With the right approach, you will be fighting in no time!So summing up:-This is a simulator, not a ""game"" per se. Expect studying a little about airplanes to master the controls.-The ""Free"" portion of this sim is more of a ""Test"" than a ""F2P"".-You don't need all the planes for you will most likely dedicate yourself to master only a few of them.-Wait for Sales to get amazingly low prices!-STICK IS REQUIRED! (for a pleasent experience).-Track IR is recommended for ease of enemy detection and situational awareness.10/10 best WW1 aircraft sim out there...			"

You can always read a book about air combat tricks of ww1, and then you will just get real close to being there, because this does feel real !!!			"

												Probably the best ww1 sim hands down as far as flight modeling and attention to detail on various craft. But really only worth it for MP as the AI is nearly braindead. If ww1 isn't a special interest for you, you'd be far better served with their WW2 product, Battle of Stalgrad, as it has much better AI, a more lively MP scene, and a far more complete starter package of planes, although it is not a free platform.

												Reversed throttle controls?  WTF?  The throttle is apparently reveresed in these older planes.  Too weird for me to fly with a reversed throttle so it took me an hour of searching in the options menu for the throttle inverse checkbox (Options --> Responses --> All planes --> Current axis --> Engine control: throttle --> Inverse).  The menu itself is quite slow to respond to clicks.Out of the gate, this game needs some configuring/learning.  If you are ok with that, then go for it.  The graphics are pretty descent for a 6-7 year old game and it's cool to fly these old planes.  The crashes are not bad either (the planes crack up on impact).  Oh, and I dropped a bomb by accident while sitting on the ground and the plane blew up...a portion of the wing went sailing through the air...nice effect!  Note to self...B is bomb, not brake.  Missions always start with the pilot staring down at the seat but a button on my HOTAS centers the pilots view easy enough.  And the FOV is a bit too narrow but there are buttons for zoom in and out.  The tutorial is impressive as it taught me things about flying that I didn't know (I'm by no means a seasoned veteran to flight sims...I honestly find them too difficult).My recommendation to play this sim is not overwhelmingly strong but since there are so many negative reviews this is my attempt to bring the rating up a tad.  And hey, it's free to try.  If you end up liking it, then buy some DLC while they are discounted.  At the time of this review, all DLC is 66% off.			"

												Best flight simulator available, imho. Period.This is not simply a game but a complex, detailed, researched and well developed simulator which recreates not only the shape, sound, speed and behavior of some of the most wild machines to ever fly on the skies of Europe, but even their feeling. If you haven't the required hardware (joystick, a good video card and a decent PC) and the required mindset (will and patience to try, fail, retry, read, learn, hardly shoot and easily get shot), this is not the game for you. Some people complain the fact that you have to buy planes and extras, something I find utterly ridiculous considering than even smartphone games nowadays give you ""buy to play"" contents, and here we are talking about well researched, designed and developed planes fo a century ago, each one reproduced with a lot of care and detail.Surely it's not a game of simple ""click and shoot"", but when you are on an open cockpit with wind and engine sound in your ears, surrounded by a beautiful landscape, clouds and light effects, looking from above a group of unaware foes below you, ready to dive on them to empty your machine guns on their wood and canvas machine, you get one of the most sincere reproduction of a dogfight a computer game has ever given to a player.

												This game is expensive. The buisness model is awfully greedy. But the game itself... is completely amazing. The aircraft are not objects just held in the air, they are alive,  you can feel the pull to the right of a rotary engine, you can feel your wing go flying off, you can feel that this game is an absolute gem. The damage model is beyond comparision, the graphics are fantastic, especially considering the game's age (it uses a lot of computer resources though), historical accuracy is also extremely good, and the field and weapon modifications allow for a much greater amount of tweaking and customisation then ever before. The only complaint I have gameplay wise is that I am not a good enough pilot. :PIf you download this, dont expect a WW1 War Thunder, this is a simulator, and a completely amazing one at that			"

												An excellent WWI flight simulator with no searious competition to challenge it. This game was a stand-alone game without Steam for few years, before they made the Steam port. I've watched it grow, and unfortunately, stall, since. If you enjoy realistic aerodynamics, thinking before engaging, mechanical knowledge and historical air battles, this game is for you. If you look for instant victory casual arcade smash-'em-up within 5 seconds of pressing the ""fly"" button, this game is not for you.Also, you will probably come across plenty of negative reviews of people whining you'll have to buy lots of planes with real life money to play this free game. This is untrue. You start with few planes in the free version that are the top of their class, no doupt. Specially when mastered, these planes are nearly untouchable, specially the French SPAD. The planes you can buy with real money are early WWI planes, mainly used in the early years of career mode or early war multiplayer maps.+ Uncompeted simulator level+ Looks good+ Damage models, machine gun behaviour, etc+ Real WWI feeling, no Battlefield 1 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t+ Your skill matters, not your equipment+ Friendly community (the official RoF forum) with lotsa help and tutorials available for both new and old players- Developement has been completely forzen for 2+ years, as devs work on Battle of Stalingrad- Fighting the AI becomes incredibly dull after you know their patterns- Some multiplayer maps are humongous, you spend 40min seeing nothing, till someone bounces you from above and behind and kills you in 2 sec. (Not really an issue with the game itself)- Talking about multiplayer maps, they are mostly dead. Except for the diehard aces who dominate the maps and instant-gimp any poor beginner trying to challenge them.			"

												ROF has been my favourite dog-fight game/simulator for the last 5 years. Glad they gave the option to migrate to Steam.Single player is available but it is mostly a multiplayer game.Epic dogfights with aircraft from the WW1 era.If you are new to this game. take your time to fine tune the controls and learn to fly the free aircraft properly and set up your joystick buttons and keyboard assignments.Most important bits: 3 axis joystick. yes you WILL need your rudder with these flying contraptions.If you have more than 1 hardware throttle lever, setup the second lever for mixture, third for radiator etc.you can save the joystick setup per aircraft so don't worry about future multi-engine aircraft.Joystick buttons: Elevator pitch trim up/down, Fire gunns, reload/unjam gunsKeyboard: I have assigned my head position forward, aft left right with the arrow keys. A huge disadvantage of a bi-plane is that the upper wing is in your view. the ability to quickly move your head is a game changer in a dogfight. Many people use it with TrackIR, I don't because I don't like how it works, maybe I need a bigger monitor for it.Enjoy the most of this game by setting all the realism settings to hard, and learn that pointing the sharp end of your bullets towards your enemy (how ever difficult that is!) is not nearly the most challenging aspect of a WW1 dogfight.For the pilots amongst us, adverse yaw, P-effect, Gyro-effect, dynamic and parasite drag). all of them are modeled in quite a good fasion. Good piloting skills makes a difference!Once you master the free aircraft, or if you have a favorite aircraft, spend a few bucks/pounds/moneys on it. it's well worth it but not required to play the game.Hope you enjoy the game! feel free to contact me if you want a chat about this game or aviation in general.

												It's been about 100h since I started playing RoF (including non-steam demo). I wanted to wait some time to be able to say something more about it. At the beggining I must admit I was never a big fan of fly simulators but I've been fan of WWI aviation since I remember. Actually this game ""forced"" me to buy joystick because previous one was way way to responsive and was cause of many problems due to very light planes. Surprisingly I've never had any problems with DCS World - different kind of planes? I believe that after few years spring in my joystick was to soft at the crucial moments.Visuals are amazing and runs smooth on I3 3220 and 7870 on high details. I had to turn some of effects off obviously but thats understandable. Sound freeks me out when you diving and can actually feel that speed.Lots of game modes - career, quick battles, missions, multiplayer. Like I said before - 100h already and I don't even fell that I achieved anything. Multi still alive but unfortunately you'll have to content oneself with FEW servers. When I type few I mean two max three. They're nerver full but It doesn't affect gameplay. All you need is 8-12 planes maybe bit more to have fun and spend some nice quality time with new friends. Because community is so small people are very friendly and happy to help everytime when you need advice. They will cover you, help and make you feel comfy. Lets be honest. Learning curve is very demanding and without internal help you won't be able to be compatitive. Some of them play from release day and there is no chance you will even approach them in combat. They fly on the edge and know every weaknes of your plane. I'm wondering... maybe just because that game is so difficult makes it so rewarding? EVERY single plane shot down in multiplayer makes you happy and smile instantly and you know by the time it's something. It's not a next random kill in FPS game - at least I feel it in that way.Do I recommend that game? YES. Oh yes. RoF is expensive if you'd like to buy all DLC at once but there is no need to do it. Few monts ago RoF was in some bundle and can be available on steamtrades easily. Even the basic version provide high quality of fun for many hours. What I do is: I just buy on every sale some DLC and improve my gameplay and experience. Spent 30 flying my career with Nieuport 17 and after that time I bought DLC with weapons upgrade. What you can do is install additional guns in your planes to increase firepower. Not only this but thats the main reason. After that change I was exited to spend next 30 or more hours flying the same plane cose it gained new quality. Hopefully this helps.			"

												Yes, atm there is no better WW1 Combat Simulator around, by far. I enjoy the game in all aspects except one. AI - AI - AI - Clearly maths, programing and WW1 fighters present some issues.In Career.1. Restarted 5x to have the same outcome where my flight leader crashes into buddies right after take off. Had to restart the game for a diffirent result where no one dies in the first 10 sec aftger take off.2. AI Fokker EIII Group attacking MG or AAA impacement like idiots. ONly flight lead shoots at it and dives while rest of wing follows the dangerous path without using lead. 3. Shooting balloons with AI is messed up. Again only the flight leader dives, 99% not flaming it up. Which means I need to dive with and catchup in height the rest of the mission.4. AI with 'better planes' just go down in altitude where you out-turn them and again spend rest of mission catching up.5. AI so repetative it's not even funny.6. Flew in a group where one AI lost one landing wheel. Wanted to see what they will do when RTB. They ended up flyinig at 600m above airfield till fuel ran out and 3/4 crashed into buidling/trees and the guy with 1 wheel was the only to survive what seemed a managable crash landing...7. So now you head to MP servers which are all mostly emty except for one with like uber vets on it and if you don't keep at it for days or weeks you will just get messed up there real bad.Given the amount of money for RoF with all expansions, I should have a career mode that works.So AI breaks Career mode for me, Vets brake MP for me. Single missions are not long term enough. So basically this powerfull game with potential - You just end up not playing. Only place I find worth while is Coop MP with a friend or two. Now they either don't own joysticks and such and end up enjoying far less than me.			"

												This is a good investment if you are new to flight simulations in general. Planes of the WW1 era were so simple machines, that you don't need to learn all kind of complicated technological gimmicks of the later era flying machines. You are just simply flying these fragile machines, that were pioneering the whole flying era of the human race. Flying these machines can still be very challenging, and mastering the art of flying with these machines is an art form in itself. Jump in, enjoy the scenery, and go back in time for a journey you will not forget.			"

Of course i had to do some key binding in order to make it work *i also still have to use my keyboard for other commands* But it works!A shame is the amount of DLC that are for it. The game started as a F2P where you have to buy stuff in order to have different guns, planes, pilot scarf, pistol etc.But once you buy the packs in a steam sale i can ensure you that you will enjoy it 100%.This is a simulator for the hardcore flight sim veterans			"

												Love this game. I play with my friends all the time. They download the game for free and they can be my gunner in any aircraft I choose. I purchased every plane back during the summer sale for $70 which is a lot for sure but this a very realistic and very small market of people that want to spend 5 mins flying to battle only to have the plane overheat and sputter down to the ground. The damage physics are awesome and you really feel like you're fighting in a World World I fighter. Everything runs smoothly and the gameplay is solid. Lots of AI and player planes in battle and AI flak guns over the front lines that add some serious dread of even taking a small hit for fear of an oil leak or being injured. I would rate this game 7/10. If you think about it though it's really a 10/10 for what they give you. Its an experience you can't get anywhere else.			"

I do wish that they would ADD a workshop on Steam for custom A/C skins for easy DL. Some of us are not that good at transfering and copying files to another file inside this file under this and type blahblah and so forth. That would be GREATLY appreciated. Been playing this game since day 1.			"

												A fun flight sim with a very detailed damage model. The flight model is directly related to the flight model. You could have 2 wings shot off your plane and still fly. All the stock planes are very capable. Buy planes from 777's website because it is less expensive then buying from steam (sorry gayben).			"

												Personally I enjoy the game based on just how fun the gameplay is.  You can very easily set up your own missions and set strange goals for yourself such as taking down a bomber by dropping a bomb on it or shooting rockets at it.  The physics are pretty great, with structural damage taking toll if you maneuver to quickly or go to fast.  The damage model is quite detailed too, something I always look for in flight games.Gameplay problems mainly revolve around AI.  Enemy bomber gunners have eagle vision, able to hit and critically damage your plane from a kilometer out and while you maneuver, disabling your engine with one shot, or blowing your wing off before you can even identify what plane it is.  This can be intensely aggravating ,and it doesn't help that your AI partners are completely inept, flying in a straight line behind the gunners, just letting them fire away at them.Of course you can't really ignore the main negative I have with this game: the pay model is ridiculous.  In order to unlock everything for this game, you have to pay $179.90...That's ridiculous.  And it's not like they give you much to start with...3 planes, and a couple of missions.  If you wanted to buy all the planes, nothing else, it would STILL be over $100That said I can still have fun with 3 planes, and so I'm going to recommend it			"

												This game is awesome!!!!This is the first flight sim that realy got me hooked. I will have to warn you, if you are looking for an arcade where your press the button and win your in the wrong place. This is a sim and you will have to learn how to fly.About:This one gives you 3 free planes.the albatros d5a which is a rly good (and forgiving for noobs) plane. the spad 13 a rly good if not the best boom and zoom plane on entety side!and a nieuport i havent flown yet.you can acces all the content with these planes so single playe careers and missionyou can also go on a multiplayer server that runs these planes (the albatros is available on almost every map!)The community made their own seperate carreer it's a mod they made you can find it on the rise of flight official forum.If you go multiplayer it's NOT pay to win it's all about knowing your plane!i have not gone online a lot but i can say most pilots there are good to even better then good and playing this game for a long time.they will teach you things if you ask. anfd if you are willing to learn you to can enjoy yourself here.In time you probably will buy more DLC's as i did :pHappy hunting and hope to see you in the air soon.

												Bravo, super good game. Everything works. It incorpoartes alot of IL-2 series good stuff and the graphics are super good. I was not sure I could play this game because of the system reccommenations. This game is the best flight sim of WW1 IT ROCKS! If your a IL-2 fan you will love this game its graphic are better than any of the IL-2 series by far. No crashes and dyfunction. The few complaint I have read about is the purchasing of add ons which to me isn't a big deal because the basic game has more planes and stuff than any other WW1 flight sim. It also has night fighting of WW1 which is a added bonus. The other complaint was about the complex nature of the game because it accurately represents what real flight in WW1 is about. If you are up to the challehge of real flight in a WW1 enviroment get the game you won't be disappointed!			"

I can only recomend this if you have a joystick, or a controller. player with a keyboard is hell with this game. The planes dont respond well with a keyboard. If you have a lower end computer, I would advise to hold off on it. For me, it freezes up fairly often, although I do love the game. Over all, I would definetly recomend it if you are a fan of aviation. Especially WW1 aviatio.			"

												First the good news - This game looks absolutely gorgeous, even with the graphics down a fair bit for my rather mediocre PC. (2yrs old, onboard graphics, no graphics card) I suppose you might argue that since it's only serious predecessor is Red Baron II it was bound to look pretty good! I've not flown a huge number of WW1 aircraft :-) , but I'm guessing that it gives a very good simulation of this. One area that I do think is a bit suspect however, is the weapons' effect. In my last flight I was firing 2 machine guns at a couple of guys in a wood and canvas box from less that 50 metres, without causing them too much distress as far as I could see. In the real world I'm about average with a machine gun, all be it from a firm bipod not the engine cowling of a Sopwith Camel, but even so there is no way they would walk away from that!Now the bad news - Like almost all flight sims this is a pretty awful ""game"".  What it cries out for is a ""gaming mode"" alongside the undoubtedly excellent ""simulation mode"", with things like the field of view from the cockpit, and a host of other stuff made much more user-friendly. Well worth the bargain price I paid for it,(£16) but don't pay more unless you are a real flight sim nut.			"

The makers of the product have been hearing this complaint for years but they steadfastly refuse to fix the problem. I won't give them any more of my money until they do and I advise you not to give them any of yours.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU HAVE A FULL FLIGHT STICK/FLIGHT RUDDER PEDAL setup. This game is impossible to play with either a keyboard/mouse or a keyboard/game pad setup.The planes are designed to be as close to realistic as possible. This is not an ""arcade"" style of game. It is meant to be very difficult to play because WWI style bi-planes were apparantly difficult to fly. So in this game you need a setup which will allow you more accuracte game play.BTW - Analog setups are going to be 100x better than a digital setup. Analog will allow for a more detailed, accurate feel for the movement of the plane.If I knew this information before I purchased I would not have bought the game because it was falsely advertised.

												- Very overpriced;- too many factual and technical inacuracies for a simulator that states to be accurate anbd historical;- is not being supported by developers, communication with customers is absent;- achievements broken since 2013;- very raw in many aspects, such as: input devices weird bring all sorts of errors, poor AI, pooly designed unfriendly interface;- controls are not rebindable, despite the presence of such option;- lack of servers to play online...and much more! Take a look at the newsletter: all you will see is the news about the sale, sale, sale, discount and a sale again. No fixes, no patches. Nothing. Keep in mind that these are also the developers of ""IL-2: Battle for Stalingrad"". Guess you can figure of what quality this other game is.In short, laziness and greed of developers completely killed the potential of an otherwise interesting game. Total scam. Buy only with 75% discount if you think you REALLY need it. Oh, did i mention that I, as well as other players ""broke"" the achievements by installing official skins from official RoF website?!PS: I am an IL-2 Sturmovik veteran, who plays it from the day it was released for the first time in 2001.PPS: - Applied for a transfer to a different flight within my own Squadron that flied Felixstowes and it took over 1 month to get the assignment. Missed part of the campaign as well as the end of the War and lost all my stats;- fresh example: wasn't able to catch a DFW with the max. speed of 155 km/h flying Sopwith Pup with the max. speed of 179 km/h			"

												Probably my favorite game as a kid was Knights of the Sky, a WW1 flight sim on DOS. I played that game for hours on end, day after day. Nothing like flying around and dueling with enemies in three dimentions. Getting within 50 meters trying to put a hole in their engine. Great times. RoF comes back to the awesomeness of those deadly duels above the trenches of WW1, and does it modern justice with awesome flight models that take realistic damage, and great physics to the point where flying in 10m/s winds is a hell of a chore.Although the game gets exponentially more fun the more realistic you set the simulation, you can simplify the physics to make things like wind no longer a factor, and you can add gauges to your hud which will also tell you the limits you can push your plane at the current moment, and finally you can add icons so you don't have to manually spot the planes against the horizon or down over the trenches. This can be exceptionally useful for new players to the flight sim genre, expecially of the hardcore WW1 variety. There is a reason there's the saying ""any landing you can walk away from is a good landing"".There are currently about 30 different airplanes (almost a 50/50 split, but the Entente do have a handle more to choose from). Most of the planes fly completely differently, its usually not just ""oh the Fokker D.VII is all around better than the Fokker Dr.1"". The D.VII might be more of a standard all around fighter with fairly high specs, while the Dr.1 tends to buck like a horse at the rodeo. But in the hands of an Ace the Dr.1 can be a terrifying aircraft. Werner Voss took on 7 S.E.5a planes on his own with a Dr.1 shooting down two and damaging all of the other five. There are some vast differences in how each plane flies, giving each easily 100 hours of replayability if not more.One of the biggest attractions of this game is the career mode, which given WW1's unique setting of largely unchanging front lines allows for random missions for your fictional pilot to fly, rather than pre-scripted storyline missions like most WW2 flying sims. Getting random missions to patrol behind enemy lines, scramble to intercept recon/bomber planes, attacking balloons, etc. just helps keep the game fresh as you fly your pilot into the history books trying to catch up to Richthofen's score. Take it from me, I've played 100 hours and I haven't even tackled the other half of the game yet, multiplayer.I can't really review multiplayer as I haven't played it at all yet. But watching some videos, it's not just shoot down enemy planes. Rather you have objectives, photograph facilities, bomb tanks, destroy AI flights, etc. to earn points to bring victory to your side; all the while keeping your eyes to sky, watching for other players who are much better pilots than the AI and who are ready to swoop down on you.To get all of the dlc, it costs quite a pretty penny. But it is so worth it in my opinion. There is nothing like starting up another mission in your career, climbing up to 2km, spotting an enemy a kilometer below you and swooping down on them, hoping you don't destroy your engine in the process or rip off you own wings coming out of your dive. This game runs the gamut from relaxing flight among the clouds to adrenaline pumping dog fights were you don't even know if your pilot is gonna live to keep flying. If you have any interest in dogfighting, this is hands down the best game on market for it.			"

												First off, let me say that you should ignore the bad reviews of this game and at least download the free part and try it out. It is amazing. Yes it sucks that you have to buy the extra planes for you to fly, DCS does this and it doesn't bother me in either.This is the best WW1 flight sim that I have encountered. Period. The flight and damage models are impeccible, with little holes getting blown through wings with them beautifuly getting ripped off after you shoot some supports. The game models CEM (Complex Engine Management) where you have to worry about the temperature, RPM, oil, and raidiator to keep your plane flying. This alone would be enough for me to buy this game at a 50$ price tag and be happy with singleplayer campaigns.But that's not all. It has created campaigns sure, but there are also dynamic careers. You pick what date you want to start, what plane, with what squadron, all in accurate historical detail. The missions are layed out wonderfully to me, where each ""day"" in game has multiple sorties. Sometimes you take part in just one, or all, or even none. The missions range from various patrols, recon, and escort missions to name a few. The missions are even pretty realistic. Sometimes you have a mission where nothing happens at all. And yes, it is boring, but I like that more than always knowing theres going to be some action. This was all just the singleplayer so far. I haven't done much in multiplayer or the editor yet, so I can't comment on them. Just know this, you can get the base game with 3 planes for free, with access to all of this content. Why not just download it and try it out? I have bought only one pack for this, it came with 8 planes and cost me 20$. I love my new planes and I plan on buying more eventually.This sim is excellent and very addicting, 9/10 "

												Game is awesome! It's a recommended game for someone who enjoys playing flight simulators.*Edit* It's been close to a year or more than a year since my last review on this title, and tbh, my opinion hasn't changed. The game is still great, the developers still continue to add and support the game. Also this is the only WWI flight sim that has fluid controls and looks absolutely stunning visually. Only real downside is the mp community isn't very popular as it once was, but people still tend to log in online at certain hours of the day all depending on their region of residence.			"

												Expensive and hard.  I got this game some time ago before the Channel Battles was added.  Over the time I played I only got 1 kill, but that might be because my joy stick is cheap.  As for the price I got the Channel Battles and two of the $30 DLCs for $6.80 on a bundle deal.  Despite the difficulty the game is a joy to play.  The graphics are up there with top notch simulators and are one of my favorite parts of the game.  Over all I would recommend this game, but on the note that it may take a while to adapt to.			"

												Really good game, but they really expect you to pay for every plane after you buy the game!  I just found it kind of lame, and aggrivating.  I bought the Channels battle edition and can't even play because it only comes with a narrow variety of planes.   At first to be honest I thougt I could get over paying for planes, but after I saw you had to pay for different guns and other things I just got really aggitated.  Really very sad about this as I was looking forward for something to succeed my old fav Red Baron 3D from way back in the day.  Now I'm just 25 bucks shorter I guess.			"

												Can't recommend enough that you avoid this game. I feel like the good reviews it has must be paid for. Very bad UI, seems geared toward pressuring you into buying things, and controls are very difficult to set up. As of this writing I have managed to get a mission started but cannot get any response on my pitch or throttle axis and the other two are reversed. I am using a Logitech Extreme 3D Pro so there is no excuse for having a hard time setting it up.  If you want a good actual free to play sim, play War Thunder.			"

												In the past I was a huge fan of the Red Baron series, having owned Red Baron, Red Baron II and Red Baron 3D and the Full canvas jacket mod. I was therefore eager to try the Rise of Flight WW1 sim. But because of the very steep price of the game and the necessary dlc's to play out a full career, I never tried it out. Until recently.At the 70% off sale I bought several dlc's for the game and started some careers. One English and one German. First I was impressed by the aircraft handling and graphics of the game. It gave me the old feeling of playing Red Baron again! That was great.But after playing out several dogfights one big thing really got annoying: in the mist of dogfighting an adversary the plane just despawns!!! This happens now in almost any mission I play in career mode. This is frustrating the complete game for me – it’s the essence of this whole WW1 sim!!!Due to this, and the steep pricing of this product, I cannot recommend any to buy this game.			"

												Great game, loads and loads of fun.  There's a few things they can improve on.  One: Support   Two: Social communication skills.  I am not a tester, I am not your employee.  I dropped a good amount of money purchasing plane packs to fly.  If you want me to do a five point presitation with slides and pictures describing my problem.  Give me a w2 form and hire me.  I wrote out a detailed paragraph and submitted it to support and all I get back is this.""Hi,Please help us to understand the problem by describing the situation step by step.Necessarily, illustrate the description with screenshots""This is not going to fix my issue and repeating that phrase in reply to my updated questions, this  is annoying and upsetting.  If you can't grasp that the in game market for planes directs you to broken pages or the wrong pages to purchase certain planes or modules and you need me to put extra work into providing you pictures.  There's something wrong with that and makes me question if you want me to submit my next support ticket in crayon.I guess I won't be spending any more money on this game like I have been attempting to but now I'm getting my junk yanked in support tickets.  I'll go elsewhere. "

												Recommended if you have previous flying experence along with any flight simulation experence, The steam version does have very few aircraft that comes with the base package. After installing a dlc i get 4 new aircraft but each dlc comes with a few airplanes and is wanting too much money for each one. Rise of flight store sells individual airplanes for a reasonable price but non steam airplanes will not work on here so its buy the dlc or nothing. IF your looking for a fun shoot em up airplane game you are sadly mistaken, war thunder is what your looking for, Being  a licenced pilot i can say these aircrafts handel like the real ones and like i said before have simulator experence before purchasing this simulation. The game requires you to set up youre own controlles and can be difficult if you dont know how. all in all its a great game but could be better for the steam version.			"

												After some issues getting Rise of Flight running, I was able to get in game and try it. from what I have played its a decent flight sim. Probably more so if I payed for the full content, as I do feel somewhat limited. Based on what I have seen. I have not played it very long at all though so I really don't know how it stacks up against other flight sims. In the end I still think I prefer DCS World to Rise of Flight United. but now that you can try it free on Steam I'm sure more people will be able to get there feet wet with the free version of the game. so go ahead and give it a try.

												Very shaky recommendation.Singleplayer and the campaigns are wicked fun.  The aircraft are amazingly detailed and it feels like you're really flying a WWI aircraft made of wood and fabric.However, multiplayer is terrible.  Not only do I meet many toxic players, but when you get pilot sniped travelling at 250kmph from someone 1/3 of a kilometer away, when they were using a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ early war biplane with terrible WWI ammunition, you know you're outmatched.  And you can't catch up if you have a life, while your competition has been playing for 3+ years.Doesn't help whoever has the better screen resolution, better HOTAS/flight setup, and potentially better headtracking has every advantage.

Other than that one little glitch on my computer at least, the games run just fine. I give them an 8/10.			"

												The first time I got wind of this game, I was interested. When I checked it out, I was blown away. Yes, the DLC may seem a bit overpriced, but when you get down to the nitty-gritty dogfighting, you will understand that the amount of work put into making the flight and damage models is immense.To the knowledgeable person, the selection of aircraft may seem a bit limited, but it is well thought out. All roles in all periods are accounted for, except an early French reconnaissance plane.The learning curve is steep, certainly for a novice flight simmer. However it is managable to get reasonably good in a short amount of time. Dogfighting is difficult, but very rewarding. You'd be best to buy a joystick that has a rudder functionality, you'll need it. A lot.Generally, there are two types of planes: rotary engines and in-line engines. Rotaries are hard to master, but with some practice, you can let them work in your favour. Just keep turning right. In-line engines are somewhat less maneuverable, you will have to rely on altitude, speed, and surprise. Again, practice a lot in quick missions and career mode.Multiplayer wise, if you think you are good enough, still expect to be shot down a lot. It happens to everyone.Overall, a very detailed game with a lot of potential. Also, don't forget to download the historical skin packs from their site.			"

Just use the account that has your steam purchased aircraft and log in on a standalone version.At anyrate, this is the finest sim that covers the first real air-war.Yes, it's a bit of an investment. It can be expensive, but it's worth it given the amount of content there is. It features awesome campaigns and career modes in addition to fun multiplayer.If you dig these old fabric and wood dogfighters, this is your game.And, want to try it for free? Head on over to the Rise of Flight website and try the free version. The hell of it is, it gives you access to two of the best fighters in game as well as a third one since the unified upgrade.			"

None of those have been invented yet.Neither have parachutes.On top of that, WW1 dogfights are in many ways even more fun than dogfights in WW2 aircraft. The planes are slower, more agile, and more fragile, so you can't just dive in from fifty million feet and wipe someone out before they have a chance to respond. You can try it, but your wings will snap off when you pull up. Engagements are terrifyingly close, and collision is always a very real threat, or option, depending on how much of a maniac you are.Dogfights also last a lot longer. The planes are reasonably tough by virtue of effectively being large kites. If you don't hit the engine or the pilot, you won't do much more than superficial damage. Most of the planes carry plenty of bullets, too, so you'll get at least one extended dogfight per mission even if you waste ammunition.The demo version, available on the website, lets your friends fly two very good planes for free, or occupy any gunner position in any aircraft, so you can get your friends to play with you even if they're broke and don't own a joystick. It's a generous move that makes up for the irritating DLC model used for the rest of the game.			"

												I don't recommend this game because you have to buy everything you only get 3 planes out of 50 and if you want to play campain you have to buy it as well as the planes, wnat to play coop you need to buy the planes that coop tells you you, want to play mutiplayer then you have to buy the planes most servers use planes that you have to buy. This game is very restricted if you don't buy all the planes. just goto there website and buy the game there you'll get everything.			"

A very well done Flight Sim. Pitty the odd copy protection that appears to have caused my initial problems with the tiltle appear to happen quite often? Regardless I can now highly recccomend this Sim. VERY FUN!			"

												I recommend this game although not whole-heartedly. If you are a flight-sim air combat fan what can I say, the sim part is great. So much so that I went and picked up a set of rudder pedals as the twist on my joystick was a bit off.That being said, you do need the hardware to play and you need quite a bit of it to play online and still compete. Joystick is a sheer minimum, I would also recommend the flight pedals, possibly a throttle control and for the ultimate, TrackIR (I'm not sure if any VR goggles work or work well).That's one of the two ""irks"" with this game: in addition to the big price tag for the base game as well as the additional planes, you could easily shell out $400 for a flight sim rig (joystick, rudder control, throttle control and head movement control), so be told!The second irk is the ""Career Mode"" which is currently in Beta, but (as of this writing) is busted. It's what I play flight sims for, a bit of role playing along with my air combat. The developers have had downtime and a big patch and the issue wasn't addressed (and may be the cause according to the developer forums). At a higher level it looks like the developers are very, very passionate on modeling flight and combat, but could use a bit of help in developing a game: the learning curve is pretty much vertical (which I expect in a flight sim) but there are very few in-game assets in getting new pilots up to speed. In all, I'd say if you are a fan of realistic flight combat sims (not arcade ones), already have the hardware, and are willing to wait for a good sale (especially for the extra airplanes), have at it. If you are looking for something with a slightly shallower learning curve, there are other, better options for you.Now if you will excuse me, I need to price out a new HOTAS rig. And possibly a flight chair.			"

												Its a ok flight sim game but it feels a lot like a money grinder by the devs, you buy the game and are able to fly few planes do some campaigns but to be able to fly all the planes in the game and play all the scenarios and ect. you have to buy separately ""DLC's"" to ""unlock"" planes and battles that i think should be in the game as a whole. To me it is like they chopped the game into bits and are selling the bits separately and in my opinion selling the game few times over. But overall it is a good ww1 flight sim game, we need MORE ww1 games and sims from that war, there are too many games that are about the second world war and not enough ww1 games.			"

												It feels awesome to patrol the air high over no man's land, eyes flicking between guages and the open sky, knowing that a lapse in concentration on either could mean death. You spot a plane, check your compass, his heading could mean enemy or friendly, dive to gain speed, he's spotted you, you're zoomed in as much as possible, wind is blasting your ears, muffling the spluttering engine. Sights are on him, heart's pumping, check for stoppage in the machine guns, trigger set, here we go, aaaaaand it's a friendly. Wave off, Never mindThe game itself is fantastic, great flight model. Multiplayer that has population (for now) and doesnt babysit you. It forces you to respect your engine and airspeed, windage, ammunition and fuel load. Most flight sims do this, but only in RoF have i managed to play a good multiplayer match that doesn't hold your hand.All of this would be so grand if they didnt rip me off on available planes. Some nutsack in marketing at 777 decided that purchasing the game will only give you 5-6 planes, when they had created over 20 for the game. I'm used to seeing this on flight simulators, but unless I can click panel buttons and instruments, 25 dollars for 2 planes and a field modification is not good enough for digital distribution.I joined a multiplayer map where I hadn't purchased any of the planes available for the map and so only had the choice of being a gunner. Bit of a♥♥♥♥♥♥time when I spent good money buying the game. "

												this game is a must have in the flight combat simulator catagory. however i would not rocomend this game unless it is on sale, even then i dont think that £7.99 for DLC's on sale is reasonable. the base game is anly about 6 aircraft you can fly, but all are open to AI pilots. maybe if the price drops a little i will get more of the DLC's.this game is in my opinion a step up in dificulty to most flight fight sims, most aircraft are very manoverable and for the most part fun to fly. the controls and hotkeys are a little confusing, but messing around with the settings you will find the right set up for you. i'd give this game a higher rating if it was not so expecive, but i give it a 7/10. it is a bit over price even on sale, the base game is worth it but the big money waster here is DLC's, but if your happy with a few flyable planes and a few less maps then thats ok.

												Rise of Flight is a first rate flight sim and probably the best all around World War One sim currently available. There is upside like the graphic rendering and the plane models. There is downside to handling the planes and the AI at times is unrealistic. Keep in mind It's a simulation game not an arcade game. It's for those people who enjoy tweaking settings and have the patience to keep on going when things get tough. For me who has been playing video games from the Atari years I marvel at what developers are able to create. Those of us who are older just sit back and enjoy the ride. (How old...my first PC was an IBM XT 8088  running at 4.77 MHz). That would be circa 1983. Rise of Flight certainly isn't very friendly to newcomers , but there are plenty of options you can toggle to adjust the difficulty level. The hardcore pilots may be fine just turning on a cruise control that evens out the engine's RPMs and reducing the wind buffet and turbulence settings, while novice pilots may find it helpful to enable unlimited fuel or ammo. Even with these aids, the enemy pilots are pretty tough group. Not only do they know how to manage their energy levels intelligently, but the tighter maneuvering of these older planes means your enemies can turn the tables on your pretty quickly.  This game does have a steep learning curve and in my opinion a joytick with yaw is a must.Before you invest in the game read the reviews. The game is a free download with limited planes but at least you can get a feel for the game before you decide if it is worth the time and money you will be investing. "

The training mission alone was so brutally burdened down with useless minutia and trivia in its multiple introductions, and you're locked into every moment of it, no matter how many times you need to just try flying in training mode. Seriously, it's like 4-5 minutes of preliminary slide-show type BS before you can control the aircraft. Every. Time. You. Train.Who the hell thought that was a good idea?			"

Especially for the extra horus of fun you can add on when you get a new aircraft. In this, you start with the basic and famous planes of the war. The Fokker D.VIIF, Dr.1, Albatross D.Va, Sopwith Camel, Nieuport 17(including a Russian version) and 28. S.E.5a, SPAD 13, Pfalz D.XII and a Felixstowe F2a floatplane. It's fun and there are hours of fun alone in the planes listed. I recommend it for any flight sim player, as myself.			"

From Flight Simulator 98 up to Flight Simulator X and X-Plane 10, as well as Combat Flight Simulators like Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator Series, Lock on: Modern Air Combat, Lock on Flamming Cliffs 2, to me this Rise of Flight United is the most realistic Flight Simulator out there..What I like about Rise of Flight United:* The flight physics is realistic* Great detail in every way, the developers made a great effort to make this as real as it gets* Weapon mechanism is realistic, like weapon mis fires ect* it is historical correct in terms of Career and Campaign modes* Engine management is realistic* Flight forces are realistic* Cockpit modifications* The ability to compare your kills, number of sorties and flight time with players around the worldWhat I dislike about Rise of Flight United:* The in ability to use cockpit switches* The lack of doing in game custom paints to your aircraftTo everyone that likes flight simulation this is a must have!My PC specs:Intel DG965Q Motherboard with Intel Core 2 Duo 2.66 GHz CPU3Gb DDR2 RamNvidia GTX 550 192-bit 1024Mb graphics card550W PSUSaitek Cyborg Evo Force Feedback joystick for Throttle, Pitch and RollGenius Speed Wheel 5 with Padals for Yaw1 X BenQ T902HDA 1366x768 Monitor (Primary)1 X HP 1902 1280x1024 monitor			"

												Now this will be a short review because i dont have much time.Anyway Rise of flight is a intense dogfighting game but isn't really ""free to play"" Its more like a demo but after buying everything it will cost more than it plays.I do like this game but only because i have a joystick if i didn't i'd hate it.It isn't worth the download but i do reccomend becuse its good fun once you get to grips :)			"

												Worst game i have ever had, once you have logged in you find out you can't do the campaign as you need to pay to get the planes to use its not worth the 5.9GB download a waste of time in my book. I would nnot get it as it is a rubblish game.			"

												Very good graphics, sound, and career mode.  With that said, the flight model is too punishing for anyone who isn't a real life pilot, and there is no effective options to get around that.  I would only recommend this game to actual WW 1 air combat veterans...			"

												So, after reading the top review of this game, I figured I should make my own. Now, this is a flight simulator. The feeling of flight is fantastic, your canvas and wood planes shake and rock about as the wind buffets your machine around all over the place. Every plane is modelled fantastically and the wings literally bend under weight or if they collide with something, brackets snap and bullets will go through both wings if shot at the right angle.This isn't Warthunder, or World of Warplanes. This is a simulator. Meant to simulate world war one planes to a detail that is as close to reality as possible without being the real thing. Because of this, getting blueprints and performance statistics for each and every aircraft that they add, costs money. It also requires a lot of time and devotion to get their simulated aircraft to a degree of realism that is unbeatable by any other Great War flight sim.My only complaint about it is that I don't have the money to spend on them myself, but the few packs that I do have I love, and I've played this game before it arrived to steam. As far as games go this day, this companies business model is fantastic, and a lot of the regulars of this game would likely agree with me wholeheartedly.			"

												I cannot reccomend this game even as free. The flight models are horrible even using a joystick, and you cannot get a steady aim on anything in the air or the ground.The aircraft don't want to fly in level flight so it is a constant struggle with the joystick which gets old fast.You are basically bouncing all over the sky to reach an objective.Anyone who has flown real aircraft will know these are horrible flight models.I cannot understand why developers create beautiful aircraft and scenery, the things we fans have waited decades for, then ruin a game by unsteady flight models deemed as ""realism"". If developers could create steady flight models that self trim when in flight and leveling off, like the Microsoft CFS series, then I could handle any realism they throw at me.But struggling to keep an aircraft trimmed or in level flight is not fun.An ingame example is: Why if I am flying at 100 km per hour in a shallow dive that I cannot keep my gunsite on a ground target? My gunsite should, at that speed, be fixed on a target not shaking left, right, up and down.			"

												Ignore my play time I've played this game alot before switching to steam.It's the best WWI simulator around. You get one plane for free the rest are in DLC packs or can be bought individually on the website. The free plane is decent but limits you to the end of the war in French Airforce. in career mode. Takes some getting used to and Joystick is a must.easily one of my favorite games honestly, and one of the few that actually makes me a little nervous everytime i get into the pilot seat. With the Career mode ending if you die or get captured, it makes you think twice about engaging that plane.  and you can die from alot more than just being shot down.if you play it right and let yourself get immersed in the game, youll find yourself doing things you never would in other games, like actually not even wanting to attack a crippled plane.There are very few games, that I know of that you want to defeat your oponent, but don't really want to kill him. It is very real bitter-sweet feeling when you're in a long dogfight and your guns break the enemy's wing in half and you see him tumbling to the ground helplessly. You're happy to be alive, happy to have won, but at the same time theres something...ominous about watching a plane flail, knowing the pilot is going through his final moments.Its gotten to the point that I don't even aim for the wings anymore, and I've shot out a few guy's engines just to escort them down to the ground in hopes that they survive. Really puts those old WWI fighter pilot's stories of Honor, and mutual respect into perspective.			"

												Great sim, not for lightweight mouse click/ kill pilots (although mouse flying works just fine in RoF). I have played the non steam version of ROF on and off since it was released years ago. IF you like real flight SIMS (example: IL 2) and like or love WWWI era areoplanes/games/sims (example: Red Baron) you will like or love this game. If you want to be the baddest pilot on the block in a weekend you will hate this title,   lol.  Now I enjoy and play  WOT, WOWS , War Thunder, AW etc, just becasue you like, or think you are competitive in an arena shooter does not equate to being any good at all or enjoying a flight sim. They are not the same thing at all those arena games are for the most part ""dumbed down"" and  are MADE  and constanlty changed to be appealing to the broadest section of potential online gamers as possible. Even War Thunder in simulator mode is no sim not even close. World of Tanks, World of Warships , Armored Warfare, World of Warplanes (ha!) none of those are. They are all fun  GAMES, I love to play them also, but they are not simulators. That's just a fact.   So just becasue you like or think WG or WT are great  does not mean you will like Rise of Flight it is a SIM , not  an arena fps shooter dressed up to look like a simulator. If you require instant gratification ala WOT or WOWS , WT. And you do not like spending time learning to actually fly your virtual A/C, and then spend more time learning to fight said A/C then you will not like this title.  As for as the DLC if you dont like the game you dont have to buy the DLC . As a matter of fact you should not by ANY DLC untill you know you like the sim or not, you get 3 fighters for free now.That it a LOT of hours of flying time to decide if you can even handle RoF. And you can do pretty much anything you like. If you have RoF long enough to master one of those three airplanes then you might want to start buying DLC and you do not need to get all the DLC maybe two or three tops and you can fight the whole airwar in europe. There are some wonderful guides to what DLC you need to get for what you want to do.  RoF is defninelty not for everybody and it is not an arena mode FPS game like WoT , etc. It is however a nice old school combat sim and I like it quite a lot.			"

												The game is OK, not great. It’s a lot of DLC and micro transaction JUST TO PLAY the game, so that is a MAJOR turnoff on games like this. You must spend close to $40 on a F2P just to be able to have both the planes and maps to play the game. I bought the non-Steam one back in the day, and I only got the STEAM Version so that I could post a Review. Off STEAM, I have 20+ hours.The fact that you need to spend almost $40 in DLC just to play the game sucks. It is not even the entire war either. You can only play chunks of the game without the DLC and that hampers seamless gameplay. This is as close to a Red Baron 3 we are going to get however with Damon Slye and the Red Baron project going bankrupt AGAIN.PROS:+ Graphics are great, autopilot is great, controls are great. There are options to adjust the realism of the controls and customize your planes and fly with Aces.+ Good and active AI, no ""easy"" experience in this game.+ The physics work nice and keeping the plane steady.CONS: - There is NO encyclopedia or tutorial however to explain how to play or what to do. The ""Learning"" missions are DLC if you want to play and know what you are doing.- If you want a good game, go elsewhere. If you want to dump $100+ into DLC, then pick this up.I haven't put a lot of time into this game on STEAM, simply because:You need to unlock MOST OF THE PLANES after you download the game, and no, not by playing the game, you need a KEY to activate the specific model and these keys do cost actual MONEY.This game has micro transactions in it through the wazoo in order just to play through a single Career or missions! You need to dump a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of money into it to advance beyond a few months of gameplay because you need the planes in progression of the War to continue playing! Looking at the TOS that becomes filled with more crap each day, you should really let this game go or you must be a true fan of dog fighting and have about a million in your steam wallet to buy all the DLC.

												All I wanted to do was play a few missions in order to decide if spending money on the aircraft I really wanted to use was worth it. However, the game is completely inpenetrable. I chose quick mission, expecting to be thrown in to the deep end, but instead I got an error message saying I couldn't play because I didn't own the aircraft that would be flying against me. So this was a total waste of my time, and will be fun to uninstall.			"

												I would first like to say that I absolutly love this game. 'Then why don't you recommend it hu?' you ask. Well becuase thanks to the wonderful Steam/Rise of Flight relationship I can't play this game even though I blew 30$ plus on this game. The menu does not work at all and even before that this game was NOT user friendly. Mostly thanks to Steam I think. But it takes two to tango so Rise of Flight is probably also to blame. I wish they would just fix the game gliches so that I can get back to playing one of the best games for fighter combat.			"

												Hands down the best WW1 flight simulator out there, and a fantastic simulator overall.If you have been thinking about getting into flight simulators, this is a great place to start; It is free, has a downright fantastic single player and a very welcoming multiplayer community. Once you get comfortable with the free planes there are frequent sales on the DLC packs.Curious about flying but confused by the trillions of buttons in a modern fighter jet?Learn to fly like the true knights of the air - with stick, rudder and nothing but a crude RPM gauge. There is no more honest and honorable way to fight in flight, and even when you think you're ready to move on to other sims,  RoF will pull you back time and time again. If it doesn't, well, maybe you belong on the ground.Let me get this out of the way - It is a fully fledged simulator, with a complex flight and damage model and it will take you time to learn. Hell, taking off in a crosswind will cost the Kaiser many airframes before you even get off the ground. Your first kill in multiplayer will take practice and disaster. The planes are built of matchsticks and bedsheets, powered by lawnmowers and liable to break apart if you mistreat them. So...uh...Don't mistreat them.I can honestly say that I look forward to see you cripple my Albatros with a well-placed burst of moustachio'd machine-gun fire. You'll love it.			"

												This game is not flyable on its free mode. Its wasting time screwing with so many email log-in &   preparation before flying, its isn't like any other flying games that's easy to start with. There's no voice introduction/narrration, video nor music to make it interesting. As I open again to play the GUI is just a picture of a plane while the camera moving around it and thats it, no other buttons to click & it means exit to me. The model's textures isn't really that detailed. Why the hell this is happening, its expensive to buy a plane model addon too.Hate me for this but this will save you from what you'll expect not.

												Don't believe the misleading ""Free to play"" attached to this game's Steam page.There is almost nothing you can do unless you pay for aircraft. This is not a plane simulator, it is a paywall simulator.It's a shame really, because the actual simulation is great, and the flights are a nice experience, but the paywalls ruin it. I'd enjoy it a lot more if you just bought the game & you had everything, rather than you start with three planes & you have to purchase the rest.TL;DRGreat simulation, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ monetary choices by the devs.			"

												RoF is...pretty.  It's also a good simulator of WW I aircraft.That said, there are better.  And cheaper.  For this game's retail value, one of its competitors offers 54 or 55 airplanes, compared to the small handful in this game, and while the graphics aren't quite as good as RoF - they're still excellent.In order to play a campaign of any length of time, you really need to go beyond this starter pack and invest in some of the DLC.  I suppose what did it for me was spending half an hour trying to find a squad I COULD fly for, then by sheer luck the very next day that squad switched out to a new set of aircraft, and would I like to buy that airplane?It's worth nothing that while you COULD just buy one plane at a time through RoF's site, here you're investing in DLC 'packs.'  Overall this starter set is an effort to get you interested enough to invest more heavily and buy all their DLC.  Only then will you have close to a complete game.  Again, compared to at least one competitor which gives you everything from 1915 two-seaters through to the Armistice...it's a no brainer. "

ROF is about making it all look pretty without the playability, confusing download content, ridiculous flight models, and really something for the ubergeek flight sim fan, so if you want a game that will take over your life just to get to fly without spinning into the ground for 3 weeks( by then you will probably, thing nah knackers to this), then this is for you, and not forgetting the aircraft buy to fly nonsense, far to expensive, with a weak, lack of depth, in the campaign, career modes. a metascore of 77 which is one of the poorest out there, just about says volumes for this game.

												Well, it´s a great simulator. BUT, it´s a shame that you have to buy planes, weapons and so on. Maybe I could have accepted it if the DLC´s costed a couple of dollars/euros, but over 20 euros for a DLC which include things that should have been there in the first place. This must stop! First, the game costs 39 euros, but it´s only half of the game, maybe less. If you want a good simulator, buy IL2 instead, cheaper, great graphics and millions of planes and stuff.			"

Just go play DCS or War Thunder instead of wasting your time trying to set up this Game.

												This game was a waste of my time.Although the visuals and concept were nice the overall quality was poorly delivered.Pros:Great world and physics overallNice customization and tuningCons:Instead of an actual free game you are treated to an almost pay n' play game where to get the full experience you have to make many small purchases and microtransactions to get what was advertised.The lag (at least on my computer) made the game almost nausiating.Like if there was a thin layer of glue underneath the pointer that was slowing it down. The same situation with the flight controls, as if they had a delay before they were registered into the computer.If the developers just made a purchase fee for the entire game, it would be one of the better games on steam, but instead they presented Rise of Flight as freeware.If this game gets abandoned and forgotten, I will be a little sad of what great potential it once had,.If the devollopers decide to make a game with the same concept and make it an initial fee game, I will totally buy it.But not this garbage bag full of pubes.

												This is not Free-to-play, the game is unplayable unless you spend some money on it. Trying to play a campaign is impossible without buying a new plane. Playing the tutorial works but you have to sit through a tutorial explaining how the tutorial works everytime you fail. I spent 30 minutes on this crap trying to figure out how to get the ""start game"" button to work trying to play the campaign with the plane I already have but the only button that worked was the ""buy plane"" button. So I broke my keyboard in rage. Also the only thing you can do in the multiplayer is to spectate unless you have bought a plane you can use. I am not going to spend money until I have atleast tried it. In the tutorial you have to load the game all over if you crash and there is no way to pause the game to change the controlls while playing.			"

												Dont be fooled by the screenshots, rather dissapointed to be honest. While the game looks great and plays really well, I was lured in by the Gothas, Handley Page 0/400 in the screenshots I had seen, only to find (after having spent £29.99, the most expensive game I have yet bought on steam) that these were add on aircraft. There are hardly any aircraft to fly ingame and the most interesting ones require further purchase, sad considering I have just spent £30.00, not impressed. The game is difficult and has a very steep learning curve, stick with it it is rewarding. It looks gorgeous and plays very well, if you like WW1 and WW1 flight sims you cant go wrong with this gameplay wise however I think the price is very steep, I would gladly pay the price if all the content was there from the start. But currently I feel somewhat ripped off.  "

												Ill start by saying this is a really fun game. it looks really nice, and runs great. But some times I feel that the loading takes too long. But thats not the real problem......... when you first get the game and play it you have like 3 planes to choose from (not exactly sure on the amount from the very start.)you pay 50$ for not much of  a game. I never really played the campaign I really only played the career mode.I love the career mode just like in  IL-2 sturmovik: 1946 (which i HIGH recommend getting) . I love watching my pilot rise through the ranks.........But heres the real kicker the DLC. MY GOD THE DLC.......30$ FOR NEW PLANES THAT SHOULD ALREADY BE IN THE GAME  WHAT IS THIS.......I CAN BUY A WHOLE NEW GAME FOR THAT, and all your really getting is some new planes and one campaigns.There is not a SNOWBALLS CHANCE IN HELL! im paying that much for DLC and getting so little for it. And because im not getting any DLC im missing out and im stuck on the same planes and campagins all the time the same linear things over and over...... So for that i can not recommend this game.			"

												I had high expectations for this game but couldnt understand the most simplest things. first of all wayyyyyy to many control keys that shouldnt be there.First try i sat in my cockpit for a good 15 minutes mashing button combos together and hoping they would work and nothing happened but atleast i figured out how to shoot my gun. Next try i started my plane some how and flew around for a bit couldnt figure out how to shoot my gun so then tried to have a mid air collision with my own teams bombers because why not my weapon wouldnt work and that seemed logical at the time, i ended up missing the friendly bomber and got lost, no planes in sight... so on that flight i decided to find out what crashing looked like out of boredom. next attempt i couldnt figure out how to start my engines or shoot my weapon but i figured out how to use a flare gun because thats always helpful, so im sitting there surrounded by grounded planes shooting flares at my team and one guy shot back, guess he was either bored or in the same seat that im in right now. Throughout all my attempts my plane randomly started berly got off the ground or went about 10 feet then the engine died.... When i was flying the game felt like combat flight simulator 3 but rediculous controls. this game was a waste of time and space on my PC. i am done i will NEVER instal this game again until a tutorial is released!

												Started the game up, it launches by default in windowed mode. I tried to change it so that it would launch full screen because there is no alt+enter feature. A restart is required to change this, but I had to restart three times before the change actually stuck.Then I tried to create a quick mission, to check the game out. Controls were great, proper mapping, didn't need to change but one or two buttons on my joystick. Create the mission, get my plane setup, ready to launch. Mission is cancelled, becaue the only plane I'm able to select is either unavailable to my account, or the file was modified. Seeing as how I just downloaded this game, the only logical explanation was that I couldn't use the only plane I was able to select. I tried launching three missions, and every time I was unable to figure out how to select another plane.I went  to the forums looking for assistance as to how to fix this issue, couldn't find any posts for it. I posted a question on what I'm doing wrong. Just out of curiosity, I tried to relaunch the game in order to see if I can't figure it out on my own. Game then kept crashing every time I tried to launch it. Three consecutive tries.Uninstalled.♥♥♥♥♥this POS.			"

												I really enjoy the game, I really do. BUT, the DLC is just to much money.  You can't unlock the other planes just by playing the game which is a total let down. DLC should usually just be in the $10 to $15 for me, otherwise it's not worth it. It is fun because of the challenges like keeping your plane straight, er, not getting shot down. If you don't have a good amount of money I don't think you should get the game since everything is so exspensive.......			"

												After starting the the tutorial mission, it took the game a whole 3 seconds to give me a head ache by displaying a video filmed by the worlds most unstable handed camera man. I was able to skip the head ache inducing video by choosing skip..... 3 times in a row.  The controls appear well laid out, with set ups for keyboards, joysticks, and mouse. It even has a mouse acceleration adjustable meter, and base sensitivity with a good wide scale which I appreciated very much. There are plenty of controls for all sorts of actions. The mechanics look great, so I went to try a mission, after wandering around dozens of things listed in campaign that were all reded out, or labeled ""Purchase this and that"" with nothing to actually play, I ssaid ""♥♥♥♥ it"" and never looked back.Bottom line: Has great potential, was to advertisment based time and lacks actual gameplay time.

												So, the full price for this game is $180. You don't need to pay that much to enjoy it. About half of this consists of campaign and map expansions, and the rest are additional planes. This game isn't new, but it is well supported, and one of the best flight sims to date, as it has better physics and damage models than most. Drop $25 or $50 on one or two of the main expansions, and you'll get a nice number of planes to fly. You can, however, put AI in any plane from the get go, which is nice. If you wait for a sale, you can pick up the full game for more reasonable amounts, but It's so well made, even full price is worth it to me.			"

												I really wanted to like this game.  But when they made it, they forgot to put in the fun. As a simulation, well, maybe it's great.  Maybe it simulates the Western Front down to Planck-length detail.  I assume it does, and in that respect, well done.  But this awesomeness (if it exists) is hidden behind so many rookie UI screwups and a learning curve so steep, it's a learning wall.  As a game, one you might want to play, it's just terrible.  It feels like it was designed by Skynet: beautiful, accurate, soulless, and with no idea of how actual human beings work.First off, on loading up, you have to log in.  That's not so bad - except the 'create new account' button was off the bottom of my screen, and moving the task bar didn't help.  A quick visit to the forums told me I had to edit the .cfg file.  Well, I thought, that's a minor lapse, probably something to do with Steam integration.  I could overlook that.In game, the text looks like it was written by a non-native English speaker: it's stilted and imprecise.   Well, I thought: small indie studio, they take what they can get.  So I overlooked that, and what is literally the worst voice acting I've ever heard in thirty years of gaming - I came to fly, not for the story!Then I started the training missions.  They are not good.  No, sir, they are not.  If you fail, you have to start again from the top.  They are also timed.  Why is a training mission timed?   Why is there no cue to tell you when you've flown through a ring successfully?  (More than once I was searching for the next ring to fly through, which hadn't appeared yet, because I'd missed the previous ring and thought I'd got it.  And other times I turned around to get a ring I thought, mistakenly, I'd narrowly missed.)  At one point, you need to climb up to a green checkpoint from ground level.  The mission tells you to turn left and climb. But it's almost impossible to do in a straight climb; one veteran player on a forum speculated it was to test your initiative, to see if you were smart enough to turn around and climb in a spiral.  Later on, you're told to throw your plane into a stall - I spent two hours trying, literally, to make my plane fall down in a way that the mission would recognize as doing what it wants.I thought the point of training scenarios were to help newbies learn.  But I am coming to the conclusion the training missions in Rise of Flight are there to weed out the Insufficiently Faithful.  The attitude is common on the forums - Rise of Flight newbies come in, complain about little things like 'my guns won't fire' (Quick Mission, by default, throws you in without ammunition; you need to tell it specifically you want your guns loaded) and veteran players get snippy because they think knuckledragging arcade jockeys are asking for the game to be dumbed down.  I'm not; I am just asking for the game to suck less.Of the many UI failures, I'll have to single out the view controls as the worst.  There are several ways of looking around - with the game camera, or with your pilot's head. The game uses multiple head snap modes, with the hat control on the joystick, to look different directions.  But the game doesn't have an indication tell you which head snap mode you are in: you could be in 'look in the direction the hat control is pushed, then back to front when it is released' or 'turn your head roughly in the direction the hat control is pushed, and keep it there' or some other mode - I think there are three, but I'm not sure, because there's no indication on the screen to tell you.  I eventually mastered the view controls (by completely reconfiguring the key and joystick mappings) to the point where they'd only kill me maybe one mission in twenty or so.  (Did I mention that, by default, the mouse controls your view as well?  So if you're playing with a joystick and you maybe perhaps breathe on the mouse a little too hard suddenly you're looking way off up to the left, instead of the big flat green surface rushing towards you from below?)  I turned on the gimp settings (simplied physics, easy controls) and tried to play a couple of non-training scenarios for fun.  But even when I shot down a two-seater, my heart just wasn't in it any more.  The sheer awfulness of Rise of Flight had made the soft gooey accurate-simulation center unappealing.  It felt like hard work, and I'm not even sure whether my opponent crashed because my shooting had a delayed reaction, or because the AI just didn't know how to avoid the ground in a spiralling dogfight at treetop level.So I can't recommend this game.  I would go so far to as say I hate it.  I hate it because I tried to love it, and it just didn't care.  I wish the developers ill. "

												Well I love sim games, I saw this game a while back; it states on the store page that it has ""Full Controller Support"", after I bought the game for 75% off which seemed like a pretty decent deal at the time; I was just about to purchase all the DLC as well. Before I did that I started reading some of the comments on the forums and I was a little disappointed to find out that this particular game does not actually have ""Full Controller Support"" as in xbox controller support. When games state that they have Full Controller Support, 99% of the time it means that the game will work with an Xbox controller or something similar. I would say its almost a fraudulent to claim that this game has full controller support. Every other game that claims it has full controller support has at least one controller layout to use. In the control options for this game I can't see anything that that says enable xbox cotroller or anything of that type. Because of that one thing which is actually a major deal breaker for just about anyone who would use a game pad or xbox controller, I am not recommending this game, a company that would claim full controller support then not offer it, is not a company in my opinion that has any kind of ethical conduct whatsoever. I am just glad I didn't pay full price for this game because I would have been really disappointed to have thrown away $50 at least they only got $12.50 since I got the game for 75% off. Good thing I didn't buy any DLC. So make sure you understand that this game does not natively support Xbox controllers or gamepads there may be some way through trial and error to get a gamepad working but as far as the game actually supporting it like say the way HAWX does you will be disappointed to know there is no such actual support.

												I don't want to slam this game as it's really the only WW1 flight sim out at the moment, and the flight model and engine is really good (even if Max detal requires a system with SLI'ed Titans, and I wish that I was kidding about that). The dog fighting feels spot on and realism CAN be adjusted for more arcade style flying, my only issue is that there is a lack of feedback when you hit other aircraft. The only time that you KNOW that you have scored hits or a kill is a light hint of smoke or the sudden breakup of an arcraft. That's a shame since the damage moddling is actually otherwise really good.The full reason for the non recomendation though is how this game feels like a big stinking con. The campaings are lacking  with there only being four structured linear campagins on offer, and one of those is the poor tutorial missions! Then there is the VERY limmited number of aircraft with the packaged game, and DLC aircraft are already IN the game but NOT flyable until you pay a frankly stupid amount of money for the privilage of taking the controls, and a single sinking solo mission per aircraft. Also any DLC bought has to be redeamed through the game NOT automatically added, in the most pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥fashon possible (no copy/paste allowed).While the tempation to fly stringbags is strong (it suckered me in), avoid this like genital herpes for it's annoying anti-consumer ideology. Want a decent (but older) flight sim that offers better and fairer bang for £$£$? Check out Il-2 1946 that while much older offers 300+ and lots of campaigns for the price of a pint or two, unlike RoF £15.99 for 4 planes.			"

												First of all, even trying to find a plane that you can even fly without purchasing is a nightmare.  When you do finally find something you can fly, the controls are a nightmare.  I have been flying flight simulators of all kinds for decades, and this is one of the worst yet.  Save your money, avoid this game.			"

												Wow! That had to be the fastest blown 50 bucks I ever spent on a video game. If you are familiar with the MS Flight Sim series this is nothing like it. Aircraft are EXTREMELY hard to control. No tutorial mode to help you out in the beginning. Just shocked how bad it's set up. All I can say is wow. Very much sorry I spent my hard earned money on it. I was not expecting an arcade style flight experience, for this much money you expect a bit of realism, but this is way over the top on difficulty, Not at all for everyone. I fully expect to get insults for my review, but I figure spending 50 dollars on something I will probably never use gives me the right.			"

												If you are playing war thunder or world of warplanes with a mouse and keyboard, whatever, i dont get that mentality myself but whatever. If you are flying an actual flight simulator like IL-2, DCS world THIS GAME etc, without at least a joystick, then what are you doing with your life?. Also btw, if youre on the fence about this game and have some crazy notions about what a canvas and wood aircraft can do... Their acceleration is quite good, and they are pretty stable in a turning speed dog fight, but their climb rate is terrible and their frames are very unstable in a high-G dive or turn. If you dont take 10-20 mins to familiarize yourself with the specs of your aircraft and flight model then you WILL rip your oil lines when pulling out of a dive. FACT: Not all aircraft in the game are equal, some where designed to be high-flying low speed scouts, other were made to be interceptors, others fighters, and others bombers. Also, two of the three free planes are quite capable and can match ANY of the payed for planes in terms of straight up dogfighting ability(as someone who owns most of them). The Albatros D.va was an older aircraft relegated to photography for the most part of the midwar and matches as a poor fighter against french and british counterparts. so with that said, GIT GUD.EDIT: I own the non-steam rise of flight verson. It irked me when i saw the reviews for this sim and I felt compelled to write a review.			"

I agree  with Justmeman117, this ""game"" is only a Demo. If you want to actually play multiplayer and campains while useing more than three planes (if you can even figure out which planes they are) you have to pay for each individual aircraft, each mission, and each f ucking map.I am so damed glad that I didn't have to pay for the game engine.

												This is in no way F2P, reason it is not is the fact you have to purchase aircraft in order to play certain missions, or even multiplayer. There is now way to unlock these aircraftvia just playing and grinding, you have to spend money. So with what I said and the fact that 98% of the missions require a purchased plane, I couldn't actually play this simulator, So it's getting a negative untill they provide more planes to play, or allow the missions/ multiplayer to use your starter planes and allow people to earn the aircraft without needing to spend a dime.

I click campaign and it tells me to buy a plane, i hit  multiplayer and i can't enter the match only spectate. I am not mad, and i hope someone can tell me how to play this free to play game for free. since so far it has very little play and a lot of pay.			"

												As much as i love flight simulator games, this would be a great game, but the thing is you have to pay to just play the game. Dont be fooled by the ""Free to Play"" because it isnt. If you want to play the game you must pay 15 dollars, at the least, just to play multiplayer. Now if they mabye gave you a default plane it be better. Its a great game when it comes to realism , i just dont understand why you must pay to even do a mission. the only way you can shoot at other planes is the tutorial and campaign.			"

												My review of Rise of Flight Limited ... Oops! Rise of Flight United Your gaming experience will be quite limited, you need to buy the DLC to continue in the game, it is more like a demo than a real free-to-play or a better description would be ""Limited Free-To-Play"". You also need to create another account in the developer's website to be able to play this.As a WWI Simulator it is very good visually (great graphics)/aurally (nice sound set), enemy AI are impressive, and the flght physics? Very realistic! well, I just took the word of the ""Pros"" in the field of flight simulator: maybe they are real pilots and who have flown these birds in real life or they may be in the field of aeronautics and have authority to judge a flight sim's ""fidelity"". The control is good when you have defined them to your liking but it is not that easy and frankly, I think it is also very limited in a way (at least for me).So, for being a ""Limited FTP"" I would say ""No"" for my recommendation rating. I could not recommend it for anyone who is not ready to spend for a DLC or two. But, if you could then for sure you'll very much enjoy this simulator! as I have ... for a limited time.			"

												Not impressed, sure everything looks pretty, only problem is the controls don't work or only work half the time. I can't even get the engine to start. So here I am ready to take on an enemy air raid and I can't even get the thing off the ground. Then the engine starts all by itself and the guns don't fire no matter what I do. On top of that there's no tutorial or any way to figure out what I'm doing wrong. I don't see how they can possible plug this as a realistic game because I'm pretty sure in real life the pilots knew how to fly the planes. As of right now, this game is pure crap and I'm out $15.

												Truly the ♥♥♥♥♥iest flight game I ever played. Insane difficulty, no chances to make it easier over a certain limit, you die and don't understant what's happened. Even shooting with your plane guns it is very difficult (not being able to do it yet). A very frustrating game that does not allow you to play on German side: you have to pay for it, as for every other plane you want to use except the standard one. Frustrating and extremely difficult, a wrong buy.			"

												The graphics are great but the controls are such a mess that I find the game unplayable.  The sensitivity for keyboard control needs serious help (I don't own a joystick).  To fly, you use the simple arrow keys, but there's nothing simple about controlling the plane.  A simple click of an arrow does nothing -- it's like it doesn't register.  So you've got to hold it down.  This, of course, throws the plane into barrel rolls and loops that are agonizingly stupid.  I was hoping for a successor to Red Baron or Knights of the Sky.  THIS ISN'T IT!  If you're up for a Microsoft Flight Simulator type experience, this probably IS what you're looking for, however.			"

												horrible control setup (entering the options menu doesnt pause the game... in singleplayer. you kidding me right now?) along with very little choice unless you spend a rather large sum of money on plane packs makes this a no for me. love flight sims, was really excited to get try this one, but no joy. The game refused to let me fix my throttle settings so i was stuck with my throttle being backwards (i use a thrustmaster HOTAS) and most controls being difficult at best to rebind and even more difficult to test (the game tries as hard as it can to sell you plane packs and avoid letting you just fly out and test your♥♥♥♥♥♥ made this just not worth the time, effort, and most importantly money for meEDIT- This is addressing the commentsthe game gives you a plane for each side for free, they're giving you a demo. You cant even just launch a default mission without them trying to sell you planes via pop ups since they set the default planes to be ones you dont have. I should have been more clear, but i honestly just didnt care enough to edit and write a longer review. You can invert your throttle settings. You cant do what every other god damn game does and just set positive and negative values on the throttle axis when youre assigning the damn thing. Let alone setting maximum and minimum values. the throttle on this joystick has a stop in the middle which makes it great for space sims ince it allows for reverse flight but is pretty annoying for a normal flight sim. think they were going to let me set the halfway point as 0 for the throttle without jumping through a million hoops?  Simple Planes, a ♥♥♥♥ing mobile game that also released on PC managed to do it better. While im glad to find out that P pauses the game... why? why would opening the menu not just stop the game in singleplayer? why isnt there an easier way to just test fly my plane to see if the controls feel right yet? I was definitely being melodramatic in the review but i stand by my point. The control setup could definitely use improvement and to get anywhere close to the full game costs well over $100, closer to $200. It just doesnt add up when i can get so much more for so so much less.			"

If you want to have this game in ful you have to spend £128 no ♥♥♥♥ing joke its really £128 for all the DLC considering you have about 4 plane open in basic this is just plain rip-off.On top of that this game suffer some considerable issues in gameplay. There are features you can ""turn on"" like autorudder but makes no bloody difference to gameplay what so ever. If you say dont feel like full on hardcore simulator today you better find another game because there is NO way to make this play like arcade bad luck.All and all I would not recomend this game at all it seem we have to wait little longer for good WWI flight game.Game Score: 2/10			"

I already have a game that I stupidly paid for and had to pay for everything in it so I don't think wasting cash on another one is smart, these game are like Poker machines and should come with a warning, wait until you spend a few hundred dollars then realize that the game was a waste of time and money when you could buy a full game with all the aircraft and other items you need come totally free and without extra cost. One more thing I have flown other flight sims before including War Thunder, the controls in this game are so hard to use for flight that it's a wander anybody can get off the ground to star flying.

												Oh wow. Where to begin. I just got this game as I was thinking about getting into flight sim games but this has throughly put me off. 1) It isn't even pay to win as that means the game is playable even without putting money in. This is straight up pay to play. I would much rather spend £10 on a game rather than be tempted by the free to play icon then to be told ""SIKE"". 2) The control are absolutly dog crap. You need 3 hands for the number of controls. It requires a hand for the mouse, a hand for left shift, control and the normal qwasderfg keys which most games use. But you also need a hand to hit the right alt and all the keys that end. It punishes you for not being willing to spend money like water AND for not having a joystick. I seriously can't get over how bad the pay to play is. In the menu you get offed about 50+ missions only tro find out ""You need to pay for that."", honestly, when your games LDC costs more than your game maybe rethink it. It has £113 worth of DLC's FFS!!!!!!!!!!!			"

												Joystick controlls are messed up in this game. You say why well o 1) In tutorial game tells you that to add RPM you need need to pull RPM controll from you to add RPM and away from you to lower it ok l did as game said but hmm something is wrong oh it's inverted then my YAW controll on my attack 3 doesn't work in this game, ROLL and PICTH controlls are well kinda... l don't know what to say like when l pull up little bit just like really little my plane pulls up like l am almost pulling up as hard as l can but then in other games it doesn't do that. Then game says that it is free to play but l don't think that playing like stupid bugged missions and training count as training. Then 3 persone view is broken. Camera is hard to controll because of that inverted movment. Optimisation is bad too l can play war thunder almost on max setting but when l play this game l have to like play on medium and this game isn't even good looking game by the way. So l will say that game looks really undone to me and that DLC thing is wrong way of getting players. l will give this game 3/10 just because l like planes			"

Now i do admit the spam was crazy but. the second time i barley even did it and was banned for 335 hours.

												I am changing my review from a negative to positive as most of the things I had issue with seem to have been either fixed or stated more clearly for buyers, So I feel I should change my review to reflect my changed opinion of this game. I will leave the initial ""good"" portion of my review for what good it may or may not do. I would suggest anyone thinking of picking up this game do some research and look up some DLC buyers guides that will explain what is actually included in the packs you buy.If you are in to the Idea of flying these types of planes this is a very cool flight game, the actions feel really well connected to the planes, the simple act of getting off the ground is a very rewarding feeling, rolling and turning in windy conditions are a real skill tester untill you get the hang of it, also pulling out of a flat stall, successfully limping a disables plane back to base and surviving a crash landing all deliver top notch skill/reward based play. The actual dogfighting/attacking style is very up close and personal, you see each round hit the opponent and it is very rewarding, compared to a modern style hud that shows a radar blip and some audio tones, you actually see the plane your hitting pop smoke and crumble to your fire.So in the end if you are still reading this, my overall impression is that the game is good, if the style of flight seems of any interest to you.

												Rise of Flight is probably the only realistic WW1 flight sim there is, so i recommend this game, HOWEVER... i dont recommend the steam version, anyone who loves WW1 and loves Flight sims and wants to get into this, you are better off downloading the free version off steam, but using your rise of flight account through the website store.Simply register a new account and use that to login to your steam version.http://riseofflight.com/account/registration/Then when you buy planes from the store (not steam) you wll see them appear even when using the steam launcher.http://riseofflight.com/store/Also check out this chart i made, itll help new buyers see exactly how much each plane will cost.https://onenote.com/webapp/pages?token=cYhYjxXywO9BWwzv-NkO1XLFfHLOfrnqtvOtgQt_WdhkRl_9ORpPHyff4ZtgITphyqDFy836Ot3jl5mhycNSZ7x4Efv52DoI0&id=636246344384748922When i first got this game a few years ago there was no steam version and all the DLC went through the website store and got added to your account... that way, you can customize what planes you want (german only fighters etc) rather then buying Steam DLC Packs.

												First note. Notice how most bad reviews are either when the game wasnt FTP or the person has under 5 hours. The game itself is utterly amazing. The best WW1 sim you will find. I cant speak for the single player as i have never played them. But the multiplayer is fantastic! The first three planes you start with are great. The Albatross DVa is arguably the best plane in game. The SPAD 13.C1 is great. However i have not gotten the chance to use the russian nieuport 17. But it looks good for an early war fighter. The community is great and loves new players as long as they shut up and listen and ask questions later. The maps are beautiful. The damage model is one of the best ones ive ever seen. The packs to get more planes are just a bonus. you start for free with everything you need, If you dont want to spend money you dont need to. The game is competative even when using the free planes. Its sad that the reviews are mixed, but thats what either impatient people or the people who bought it a few years back to learn that it is free. The game is one of my favorites and i highly reccomend.			"

												Now I was wondering why this game had mix and mostly negative reviews.  This is why.  So they say this game is free to play and in picture show a bunch of sick planes.  When you get this game you play the tutorial and then find out you can't play with any other plane or campagin.  Now this right here folks is a demo.  Now this makes no since but lots of people just say its a demo, because you only do trainning and fly one plane. Yet you can still play mulitplayer.  So if you would like to get access to these very awsome planes then you must buy the dlc to get the camgains and planes and stuff.  Now for those of you thinking this is the stupidiest idea ever yes I agree with you 100%.  Is it pay to win.  Well I don't think so this game is more just skill.  So I don't think its pay to win.  So if you plan to get this game make sure yo have about $15 dollars left over to get at least on dlc.  Trust me this game is very fun and balanced.  Down side well you have to buy the whole game. Me myslef have all the dlcs because I like to play it but I don't have that many hours on it. So remeber DO NOT GET THIS GAME UNLESS YOU PLAN TO BUY AT LEAST ONE DLC SHORTLY AFTER.			"

												This is by far the best combat flight simulator I've played in years. Flying the old planes is really exciting, you must focus all the time to keep it straight in the air, which is a challange but also a lot of fun. Only downside is the content, a lot of it is dlc, and it's quite expensive as well. Overall: 9/10+ Fantastic, deep gameplay+ Graphics, lightning+ WW1 setting+ Sound is ok- Expensive dlc- Not an easy game to learn (may also be a good thing)			"

												This was a negative review changed to positive.  Read on for why.The game is definitely worth playing, and therefore I recommend you get the game and add the DLC modules to your wish list.  When a sale comes, load up and go fly.  It's all the IL-2 quality in a game for WWI planes.The only real downside after playing this game for many hours now is the lack of really good AI in the career (offline) mode on either side of the front.  Even if you can get your fellow flightmates to get into the mix, they will fire off all their ammo and do some pretty redonkitarded maneuvering trying to get shots off - so they waste their entire ammo load shooting up the sky.  Or they will shoot you if you get in the mix.  Or ram you out of the sky as you're closing for a shot.  As a result, you can fly for weeks and weeks in a squadron and be the only one scoring kills.  Enemy AI is no better, as they don't ""see"" you at all until you close to within .30km.  Because of this, you can fly up under a formation of 5 enemy alone, and creep up slowly and pick them off one at a time.  The others, well within 1km of the action, never seem to notice one of their friends getting shredded right below.  They never react as a flight or coordinate in their response.  This is kind of sad, considering they managed a better AI in the 1990 Red Baron game, where you could even tell when you were going up against an ace, and sometimes even which one.Otherwise, it's great fun and everything you'd want in a WWI sim.

												Many other reviews are extremely negative due to the fact that this game is not free to play. You only start out with three planes, and most everything is off limits. However, this is the best flight simulator out there, especially for WW1. The game is challenging, and rewarding when it is mastered. You need a joystick at least to enjoy the game. Also, the complaints about the free to play aspect are unfounded. The same people will go out and drop $60 on Fallout 4, which is enough to buy most of the DLC in this game.			"

												PTJogo de aviões de qualidade, como normal, os aviões daquela época eram mais lentos mas mesmo assim a forma de morrer e conduzir está boa, só que com poucos jogadores e conteúdo pago que faz desmotivação.ENGGame quality aircraft, as normal, the planes of that time were slower but still the way to go and drive is good, but with few players and paid content that is demotivating.

												Nice looking game, BIG BUT coming now though!  Gone with the days of buying a game and then you have it.You pay a massive ammount for the base game and you get nothing for the privilage. None of the maps or aircraft bar one or two are unlocked, YOU HAVE TO THEN BUY THE GAME AGAIN!!  massive russian made rip off.The game even goes as far as to only allow you to start from the furthest away bases in multiplayer because AGAIN, you have no planes, maps ect and have to buy more privilages.They really do give you nothing for your money!  With the base game you can only fly the training missions of which have Extremely poor briefing videos with bad acting and english spoken and really below average graphics.The game play, flight model and scenery are of good quality but i cant say anymore about that as i'v bought a game that doesnt exist and i cant play any part of it!!!At least be a little more generous at first and if its a good game ill defo pile more money into it for more stuff but as you are tight arses ill give you the bird and take my money elsewhere!Thanks for nothing....Edit: 18 Dec 2016:  Ok now time has passed and they have finally seen sence and opened a bit more of the content up!  Still a bit peeved that i payed for the game and now its free to play but i was pleasently surprised to see an extra plane and a wealth of missions, campaigns and content avalible with an easyier to understand UI.  All in all i feel i can finally apreciate the game because the WW1 air war is a true gentlemans dog fighting experience.  I know i havent had much time on the game but as a real pilot and a massive simmer i know that this is going to give me hours of fun, so i have changed my review to show my apreciation for the quality of the game.

												The dogfighting in this game is like high speed chess with physics. I've been thoroughly enjoying learning how to conserve energy and maintain advantage in a fight. Energy is life! In order to avoid dissapointment do be aware that 'only' online multiplayer, the training campaign, quick battles with AI and career mode along with a couple of flyable planes come with the free version.

												I have many more hrs than shown because I played originally on an account in the website. This game harkens back to a simpler time. When men were men and airplanes were sketchy to say the least. No parachute to save your♥♥♥♥♥ no doubt due to the fact that once a WW1 pilot crammed his balls into the cockpit there simply wasn't room for one. I absolutely love this game and it's free. The free planes are just as viable as any other if flown correctly. So think you've got the nads to take to the skies and fight with a wood and canvas craft, with about as much horsepower as your average golf cart. Check out Rise of Flight , be a man!!			"
