												Scarily addictive. The jazzy music and goals make this game able to last hours without even noticing.If you're a fan of management sims and love those ""Just one more upgrade"" kind of games, this is a one for you.			"

												I feel a little conflicted in writing this review.  There are some elements I felt this game did pretty well.+Pretty good music+Great opening video+Interesting idea+Mechanics are pretty solid-Art style is hit or miss-Takes too long to go through the week-Not enough events to break up repetitive game play			"

												There is no doubt this game is cute. That being said, the game is super repetitive. I turned off the music shortly after I started the game, as the songs repeat over, and over and it quickly gets on your nerves. There is little variety while you're playing either. You set to one task during the day Monday-Friday, a different task in the evening and then something for Saturday and Sunday. You can't pick what to do each day, so if you finish a costume on a Wednesday, you're stuck ""working"" on it the rest of the week.At any rate, I'm still addicted to trying to get all the costumes. But, I'd love more variety in the game play.			"

												For anyone in or around the cosplay scene I think this game is a must play! Relatable and exciting story tied together with clean, incredible addictive gameplay really make this game difficult to put down.The music is beautiful and the dating aspect is so Persona-esque the game feels automatically familiar.If you ever wondered what it was like to be a cosplayer and hop onto the wild ride that is the convention scene... You just got your ticket!			"

												Developed by Locked Door Puzzle, who seem to like putting the sound that goes with their logo really, really loud; Cosplay Maker is a time management/dating sim game.As the rather unoriginal but quite aptly descriptive name says, the game revolves around making cosplay and all the drama and things going on around it. The game starts with you at a convention (and you can’t customize a single thing about your character), getting all ready to start on the cosplaying world. You make two friends there, a cosplayer and a photographer, who you will (if you so choose to) keep in contact with during your gameplay and meet in future conventions, and they will in turn give you ‘advice’ and introduce you to other characters as you progress through the game.Any of your friends you’re able to eventually date provided your friendship is high enough, a stat you will have to maintain by taking some “friend time”. This is the dating aspect, which if I’m to be honest I didn’t care to try. Why? Because the characters all fell rather flat and uninteresting, and I just couldn’t muster enough interest in the storyline.The time management aspect of the game comes in the cosplay making part. Every so many months you will have conventions to enter, and in them cosplay competitions you can enter into in turn. In order to make your costumes you need to get ideas (unlocked by buying things, relaxing with some TV, socializing, etc), and materials (which you need to buy).  In order to get money for the materials, you have to work – which causes your “energy” to go down. Energy can only be recovered by “relaxing”. So far so good: it takes typical stats to do things, so you have to manage your time carefully.The problem starts in the scheduling. Your schedule is bunched so that Saturday and Sunday are bunched together as one big “Weekend” chunk, and your days are all bunched together in “day” and “night” of the week. You can not micro-manage day by day, which is absolute bullcrap for many reasons, the most blatantly obvious of them all being that when you get your costume to 100% completion in the middle of the week, you are still stuck “working” on it the rest of the week just because you can’t pause and modify the schedule.Likewise, the rate at which you gain and lose stats, although manageable, is annoying and would benefit greatly from some micro-management choices. Once you’ve scheduled your day, you hit play and the week passes with a few repetitive, boring animations, but quite upbeat music. Despite the lack of interesting animations (you never actually see yourself working on the costume, you only see yourself wriggling your arms and head), the first couple of times you see this it’s alright. After the first couple of times though, the slow speed at which the week progresses before your eyes is tedious at best, and though there are events that break up the week pop up (requiring an ‘ok’ to close, so that you can’t even go do something else meanwhile), most of the time they are a boring and inconsequential interruption. Such is the case of one in particular:“Another day of steady progress in your costume.”Geez, how… ground breaking. Can we speed this up, please?What is more infuriating is that there is no way to skip or speed through the week. Okay, there IS a way, but you have to purchase it… can you see how ridiculous that sounds? How can something that should be base game need to be purchased?At this point I should mention that while there is a tutorial to the game, it’s a rather lame one, and mine got stuck for quite a bit, too. Another annoying thing is that the cosplay costumes seem to take forever to do. I mean, seriously, I’m no seamstress and I’m pretty sure I could do something faster than this girl…As for the rest: there is some progress and goals, the goals seem a bit far in between (from “make an outfit” straight to “win competition”) and the progress seems pretty pointless. It also seems you’re unable to sell either your old costumes nor your excess material (if you bought something by mistake, for instance). The variety style on cosplay outfits to choose from though seems okay. That pretty much sums up all of the gameplay aspect. Moving on to the small technical bits, the game felt unnecessarily sluggish for something so 2D and plain. Sometimes switching from regular week to event seemed to take a bit too long, and the loading of my file or new costume ideas also took unnecessarily long. The loading screen also seemed to have no indication of just how long it’d take to finish loading, which was rather annoying. The menu is plain, the music in the menu pretty bad, but surprisingly I found myself quite liking the rest of the songs on the game – all upbeat and fun. They didn’t seem to match the game a whole lot for me, but they were nice, up to the point where the same 3-4 ones started to play over and over and over on the week playthrough. Good thing I liked them… The intro video was interesting and nice, but absolutely unneeded. The whole bright color scheme of the game with the fancy old style music seemed to want to remind you of Persona, only it didn’t quite make the cut.The graphics aren’t he worst I’ve seen, but they are definitely not what I’d personally consider “nice” or of sufficient quality to match the price tag. All in all, Cosplay Maker seems like a very good game idea executed a bit poorly. You do get some fun out of playing it, don’t get me wrong, and it can get a bit addictive to do just one more upgrade on a cosplay or one more outfit or one more week… but it’s not really worth the price to me in its current state. Basically the only thing you’re truly paying for here, to me, is the music.			"

												This game has a lot of potential but, in the end, falls flat. The fact that one of the main characters declares the final main story scene as ""an anticlimax"" pretty much sums it all up.I was immediately disappointed when I started the game and realized that I couldn't customize my character's looks at all. I expected to be able to change her hair color at least! Nothing. On top of that, the surreal feeling of being the only character who doesn't talk is pretty strong in this game. Even when you talk with your friends on messanger during the week, the chat bubbles only point one direction... she is silent in all things.I was disappointed again (though not surprised) that there was no creativity when it came to making the costumes, either. The tongue-in-cheek references were sometimes slightly amusing, but they would have felt more natural if there was humor in ANY other part of the game. And there really isn't.The side characters are all okay, a little bland but not too bad. I can't imagine wanting to spend enough time ""talking"" to one of them long enough to date them. The friendship stat goes up so slowly that it was almost laughable. The main storyline isn't the most exciting, but it was good enough that I decided to play through to the end. The last two scenes are painfully anticlimactic, however. There's almost no hints to the ""culprit,"" which makes the reveal boring, since there wasn't really a sense of ""did I guess right?!"" I'll use rot13 to add my final thought on the plot: Senaxyl, V jnf ubcvat gur ragver gvzr gung gur CP jbhyq or gur zlfgrel cbfgre. Gung jbhyq unir orra n gjvfg!The upgrade you could buy (for ridiculously high prices) were almost useless. I noticed almost no difference between the lowest sewing machine and the highest, and the magazines and books brought up your stat by so little that they were effectively pointless. It also irked me that the developers put in the option to buy and upgrade that made each day go faster (and yes, you will HAVE to buy this, because the repetative and boring screens will make you fall asleep otherwise). The main thing that annoyed me, however, was the oversimplified schedule. The game would have improved 100% by simply letting me choose a different task for each day of the week, instead of having to pick one task for the entire workweek. There were lots of times when I wasted a day because my costume was already at 100%, etc. If I had been able to make more choices, the slow friendship stat and low wages would have been easier to swallow.All in all, this was a very mediocre game and it didn't have enough humor to justify playing it, even if you're very into cosplay/anime/manga. If you do decide to play it, I have two tips:1) Don't waste your money on the games available in the hardware store2) Social media presence is VERY important.			"

												This game is very slow and the tasks are repetitive, which is a huuuuge drawback - it's alright in small doses. I do enjoy the funny overarching story and appreciate the details regarding costume making. I feel that the social aspect has been well developed and I do love the graphics. The costumes are great as well as the character's skill development. It's not the best casual game out there but it's innovative and I would recommend grabbing it when it's on sale.			"

												If you're a fan of those simulator types, this game will keep you entertained for some time. I love most of the costumes, and the music and intro video is surprisingly good. But for me, that's it. The game itself became boring (and long) after a while and the story line wasn't good enough to keep me playing.			"

												Cosplay Maker is more like diary management than a game. There’s too much waiting around and not enough stuff to do. The story is okay, but the animation isn't interesting enough to watch more than once.For more details read my full Cosplay Maker review[www.therockstargamers.com] "

												A fun little time management game. Definitely a good representation of the cosplay and convention community as a whole. Game feels a little unpolished, and the gameplay is a little repetitive, but time sort of flew by as I played it. The main story is solid, though I would have liked the romance subplots to play a bigger part in the narrative. You get someone's relationship value high enough, start dating them, aaaand never really hear anything about it again.Bonus points for the game continuing after the main story is done. Much like doing real cosplay, it never ends! You're here forever! :D			"

												Where do i even START with thIS gaMe......as a cosplAYER im insulted that the developer belived that cosplay is a joke and a half aparently. she make it seem like cosplay is a waiting game.....and in some way it is, but mostly its a skill game. you use your skill to make cosplay cosumes in order to win affection, love, sex, money, and industrial innovation. all of these are important.secondly, cosplay is NOT a matter of hobby. hobby cosplaying is like hobyy music making. stick to myspace music BOZO and get away from the real deal cosplayers!! cosplay requires all your time and money! you cant just go and work a fast food job weekdays, evenings, and weekends and expect to build the perfect cosplay. thats rediculus!thirdly, cosplay is not for the faint of heart. you have to give it your all!!!!! i ahve spent around 10,00 dollars bu8ilding my fabrics colection and it not easy.it not easy.so before you make anothewr cosplays game, please do some f*cking research DUMMY!!!!!! or else the whole cosplay community will be laughing and pointing at you with anger!!!f8uck you			"
