Borderline on buying this game? Read on.I bought 1931: Scheherazade on sale, probably for about $10. I was very borderline on the purchase due to reviews, but ultimately enjoyed myself. I nearly loved it, in fact, and am going to play it probably several times over. So it hurts me to have to say that this game is *not recommended* for anyone that doesn't deeply love the Otome/Visual novel niche, especially at full price. I'm writing this review because while the other reviews aren't wrong, they don't really pinpoint exactly where the game fails and where it shines. I want to help you decide if you would enjoy the game despite its flaws. I very much did.If you really like it, why not recommend it?The huge problem with 1931: Scheherazade is its stats/time system. Even on easy, the obstacle level system is unbalanced and poorly explained. Let's say you spend turn after turn leveling up one stat or, like me on my first try, randomly trying to grind a few things evenly to support a specific playstyle. Once you get on the ""same wavelength"" with the game, it isn't too unfair to get around in most situations. However, 1 of 4 things will happen to you early on.  The one stat/inspiration you ended up grinding meets close to the obstacle level! Hooray, you pass. The one stat you ended up grinding isn't used, and instead this other random stat (NOT listed on the obstacle challenge list) has just as high of an obstacle level. In fact, the stat you prepared for might not even come up in the challenge depending on the options you play, and there's almost no way to tell. I've even done a few that listed several obstacles, only for me to have to face none. There's also the opposite, where I only had 1 or 2 of the listed obstacles and the rest are unlisted obstacles. None of the stats you've evenly grinded meet obstacle level. You blunder your way through the mission and wrack up a lot of stress or you save scum and have to grind some more. The challenge you were grinding for is removed as an option because its time limit (which is not shown to the user) is up. This doesn't happen very often and namely has only occured to me at the start of the game, but it's extremely confusing and frustrating when you're just getting into the game's groove.This game would have greatly benefitted from a dynamic system that adjusts to your skill level. One that could tell what level your skills are and initially adjust the obstacles to something reasonably above that to push you to do better. Even the inspirations you train for can be random and not be enough, forcing the player to save scum to keep up.Stress itself adds so much to the obstacle difficulty. Have a tiny bit of stress and watch the obstacle levels skyrocket.  But, like every other stat you need 10 points to get a grind bonus of +1 to stress stats. This wouldn't be so horrible EXCEPT random events that have obstacles can appear and affect your relationship with other characters. This can be a big deal when trying to romance specific characters that are known to be more difficult than the others. You can even rest away your 2 stress only to get an uncontrollable random event that only exists to give you stress, making you waste turns for no reason.Instead of a dynamic obstacle setting, everything is on a linearly increasing difficulty path by what I assume is the ingame date. Do you have 0 Diplomancy because you haven't needed that skill at all? Do you suddenly need Diplomacy for a required skill? You might be out of luck if you're later in the game. Even when training the whole time until your next trip, you might not have enough time to reach the requirement and will miss out on the rest of that character's entire romance subplot for the game. Oops.AKA, the stat mechanics and requirements suffer horrendously from a lack of clarity.GRINDING THE STATS THEMSELVES CAN BE TEDIOUS.On the plus side, by saving and loading at just the right time, there's an ""infinitely grind stats without using a turn of time"" cheat I figured out myself. On the minus side of that, there's no way to ""skip"" days, which was a problem even during my first playthough (which was legitimate). While in the early game you can never get enough to meet some obstacles or, in mid/late game, a random new high level obstacle for an arbitrary skill can come up, the rest of the time could be spent just clicking getting to the next thing, which just points at a completely different game design balance problem.That's a lot of flaws. So why did you like the game anyway?I need to make it clear that I love these types of games. I love branching and well written stories, and Scheherezade has that. I can tell that, mechanical balancing aside, a lot of love went into the references and story of this game and it shows through even the frustrating grind. The art, while not breathtaking, was varied. It was detailed: characters would visually wear costumes that only appear for a few scenes in a single quest, to comedic effect. Even the goons got things like alternate costumes, pallet swaps, or their own designs. It quite grew on me.The female protagonist is strong, competent, and adventurous. She was fun to play as. She was always getting into odd adventures, some ridiculous, some daring, and she was always good humored. She's almost always entertaining. The dialogue and choices can be witty/funny. I'll give an example of an optional (Key word: Optional) exchange between characters:Female Protagonist: (Excited) Roland, Roland, Roland! We've had a sighting!Roland: And when she said his name THREE times, all her fondest wishes came true...Another is when a pesky squirrel stole something important. I was given the option to use the ""fisticuffs"" stat on the squirrel and proceeded to have a showdown with it.There's a lot of these.Options, even the ones just there for fluff, get unique responses at the least. Most games don't do this. Want to be pessimistic? Optimistic? Plain goofy? The people around you will respond uniquely in-character.It really does feel like an adventure. Sometimes the writing might go over your head if you aren't a buff on history/old religions and their gods, but there's this atmosphere of adventure and exploration that comes with helping the protagonist figure out, say, the puzzle of the mechanical statues that control hidden panels of the tomb. Or stopping the mafia auctions of priceless artifacts. The list goes on and it's all good fun (if you managed to get your stats/inspirations right).The game has a lot of meat on its bones, even with the long-winded grinding system. I doubt even in my 20 hours that I've barely broken the ground for all this game has to offer. The content is unique, it's engaging, it's fun, it's humorous, and there's a lot of it. The characters (even the minor/side ones) are interesting and can make multiple appearances. I've only finished one romance but all the guys seem interesting and have a good chemistry with the protagonist. I found myself amused by everyone's antics and goals. The ones that know each other have their own amusing interactions and stories, as well. Basically, almost everyone is endearing and entertaining in some way.The epilogue is pretty detailed and, dare I say, touching. Nearly every discovery, adventure, or friend you make takes a full circle at the end, resolving everything quite nicely.I'm running out of space here. I could say more positive stuff, but alas, no room. Hope I helped.EDIT: Game hasn't been updated to fix any of these issues as of Jan 2017 and I doubt it will ever be, so you gotta take it as it is.

												How I wish I loved this with no misgivings. In theory, it's got it all: Prohibition! Travel! Archeology! Intrigue! Romance with a mummy!In practice: overly complicated interface! Unbalanced stats system! Info dumpy dialogue that lasts so long I could go make a sandwich! And a heroine, Sadie, who is inexplicably both a Girl Genius and Too Stupid To Live.Don't get me wrong: 1931S:TLoP has merits, and it's commendably ambitious, which is why I'm not giving it a bad rating, but a lot of things drag it down.The UI issues alone make it exhausting to play, and eat up a lot of time. Like other stat-raisers, 1931S:TLoP has menus for the MC's traits/skills, jobs/tasks to raise them or get other perks, etc., but the UI design is far from intuitive. It's very pretty, but lacking the functionality that keeps the mechanic from being boring.Let's say you want to raise one of Sadie's skills. From the map screen, you navigate to the skills menu. Instead of an at-a-glance list, there are buttons for each skill category. You must then hover over each, look at the sub-skills that pop up beneath, and if the one you want isn't there,  move on to the next. There are dozens of sub-skills, too, so unless you've got a photographic memory, good luck remembering which one belongs to where.(On a technical note, sometimes when you hover over a skill category and then try to click a sub-skill, the list disappears, so you have to go right back and try again. Arg.) When you finally find the stat you want, you click it, then wait for a list of tasks to pop up in a sidebar. It should be as easy as clicking what you want to do, right? Nope! Clicking the task drags you back to the main screen, where instead of doing it, you're faced with all the tasks that take place in the same area of the map. This then requires you to skim over the descriptions of the jobs that are available to find the one you need, click it, then wait for a bubble to pop up to let you know it's done.So, to sum up, it's open skill screen>hover over one of several categories>select one of 5-6 sub-skills>select task>open task screen>find task in group of 1-8 tasks>select task>complete task>repeat.Then you have to do this all over again. And again. And again. Three of these tasks in an in-game day, often. In another game, you'd learn the available jobs, the stats they raise and their locations pretty quickly, thus cutting down on some of this time suck, but your character regularly ends up on a new map with new tasks that are grouped differently and raise different sets of sub-skills, so you have to learn them all over again only for that information to become useless the next time the MC travels.Sound tedious? It is. This problem could be remedied by a simpler menu designed for function instead of form, but as is, it's a mess, and I'm sure I spent more time going between menus than actually advancing story. At first it's not so bad, but a full day of tasks that takes about five seconds in a game with a better interface takes about thirty in this one. That adds up fast.The unbalanced stat system is also a pain. You train a skill as high as it can go and still need to use ""Inspirations"" (skill point boosting items) to complete adventures, but you can only carry so many Inspirations at a time, and each one is only useful for a few skills. I guess this is fine if you're planning on a specific strategy, and playing through a single storyline, but if you want to keep your options open and explore--as one might in their first few playthroughs--it's limiting.It also suggests, to me at least, an incredibly broken system. Even if you max out a skill, it only goes as high as 10 points, yet some of the challenges require scores of more than 100, and the boosts carry between 1-10 points. So, if you come up against a 100 point challenge, best case scenario, you'll STILL need at LEAST 9 Inspirations to complete it. Adding insult to injury, you only have space for a limited number of boosts and those have to be acquired through the same slow system as skill points.This is bad enough, but many storylines don't have a break between skill checks, so even if you horde enough Inspirations for a high score in Grace, if the next skill check requires an equally high score in Riding, you're screwed.It's ridiculous. You don't pay someone a penny, tell them that's all they're allowed to earn and then demand they give you a dollar. Like...??? Why would you do that?The less technical aspects of the game also suffer from some problems. The writing isn't bad, but it can get dull. As you'd expect in a VN about archeology, there's a lot of history/myth relayed through dialogue, but it goes on forever and grinds things to a halt. (Not good, considering the menu/stats issues already make the game feel slow.) It seems like characters spend more time reciting textbooks than being characters, and my eyes glazed over more than once even though I'm interested in history and myth.In contrast, the relationships you can pursue are refreshingly breezy. They're a bright spot in the game and make it all worth while.Finally, we come to the main problem with the writing: Sadie. I want to like her. I do. But: when she's not being unrealistically competent, she's holding the idiot ball.Running into danger that ought to get her killed despite other characters' reasonable caution, she stumbles from disaster to disaster wide eyed and stupid, yet survives without a scratch. It's bewildering, and makes me long for the sense of danger in other games of this genre where doing boneheaded♥♥♥♥♥♥WILL get you killed.She's the hero, I get it. Heroes are lucky, and do ""brave"" things that are also dopey but live to push the plot. Still, even Captain Kirk has a transporter accident or ten, and when Harry Potter does something dumb, it has consequences. That's not the case here, and it's disappointing. Sadie is Teflon; nothing negative sticks to her, even when it logically should, or when it would make a more compelling story. Even things like failing challenges and maxing out your stress score have NO impact on anything at all.(It's also annoying that she'll give other people a hard time for doing the same stupid things she does but nobody calls her on that hypocrisy.)I should also mention the lack of same sex and love interests of color, which bothers me. (Ahmose technically counts as a PoC, I suppose, but he's bandaged head-to-toe so it feels like a bit of a cheat, really.)Additionally, there's some unfortunate implications in that, despite traveling to places like Egypt, New Orleans, Peru and Turkey, where white people should be outnumbered, they're still the central focus and the non-white folks who show up are either thugs and thieves who try to kill you or bit characters who get one line, with rare exception. This is a highly problematic oversight, to say the very least. I'm sure it was unintentional, but still, the dearth of fleshed out, non-villainous PoC makes me uncomfortable.***SPOILERS***Adding to my discomfort is the story's climax in which Sadie has the opportunity to use a magical relic to potentially keep the Nazis from truly coming to power in Germany but instead goes, “LOL no *destroys artifact*” because reasons. There's a very thin rationalization for this but, uh...perhaps not the best plot point to use, there. It's pretty difficult to enjoy the game knowing that the narrative unintentionally makes Sadie—and you, as you can't do anything to keep her from this action—complicit in not stopping the rise of Nazi Germany.***END SPOILERS***Aside from these things, it's not a bad game, just has a lot of little finicky issues. I'm hopeful that the sequel will be more intuitively designed/streamlined, which will definitely make for a more enjoyable experience. I'm sure that even if the sequel's dialogue remains as overstuffed as 1931's,  it'd feel like less of a slog with a better interface.7/10			"

												Entertaining complex visual novel.Casual gamers may find skill system more than tedious.As it is visual novel it is text heavy.Some times things felt like there were dragged out a bit.Over all stories and side characters were reasnobly designed and interesting.Sadie can come off bit dull with how closely she borders ""Mary Sue"" when compared to other characters.Most of the dialogue is well written and fun.Overall very well made, fun and light hearted game.

												A cheerful visual novel with a little more stats-juggling than usual. There is a difficulty system, so if you aren't into stats juggling you can just pick easy and still have fun. The game also show you which stats are used before you pick a storyline and it helps a lot. There are also ""Inspirations"", single-use stats booster you can get on the map just as easily as a regular stats increase, which is a welcome addition.Interface is pretty but could use some work, especially the map where it can be easy to click on the wrong locations due to their proximity. The skill screens could use more information and a better sorting (alphabetical?). The diary screen should omit the empty dates as they look ridiculous, and the fonts make it slightly hard to read. On the nice side, that mean you have easy access to story recap. The backgrounds are evocative and really pretty.Probably should get a new artist for the character art, though. I meant it. The eyes! Characters are fun to interact with and well-written, and they all have fun dialogues. There are a lot of different stories that make multiple playthroughs viable and enjoyable. The game is bigger than it looks content-wise.As a visual novel the game's strength is firmly on the interactive novel side with its cheerful writing. There is a lot of that.			"

												I have owned this game before it was on Steam and played it a lot. Disregard my displayed time spent in game and believe me when I tell you there is a lot to this game. This is no VN to be ""played"" in an hour with ten choices to be made over that hour. This is a RPG light/Time management game with lots of hilarious content and an interesting stats system, where your permanent stats need to be supplemented with temporary boosts to pass the challenges the game puts before you.The one thing I disliked about this game is that certain events, e.g. location changes, are just sprung on you with little preparation.For storylovers, this game is absolutely worth the asking price, but if you have doubts, definitely pick it up in a sale.

This game is really fun and can be challenging.A cheerful visual novel with a little more stats-juggling than usual.It is really an intense game especially on your first time. I like how you can raise your stats and choose which to decide but it can be really troubling when you have no clue what to raise. First time I played I had no idea how to play and the instructions didn't really help all that much for me but once I started learning this game I got sucked right in and wanted to know what happens next.Although this game does have lots to offer when you get to go on adventure and see the different maps and funny adventures your character go through.

												The good: Story line, visuals and the amount of choiceThe bad: This game is not flexible. AT ALL. You better find what you wanna do and stick to it.The ugly: Stat raising wouldn't be so bad if there wasn't a million of them and if the game didn't require to max half of them in order to progress correctly. This was executed poorly and pretty much wrecks the game :(			"

												From a story perspective, the writing is pretty great: complex, characters with interesting stories, clever plot, historical accuracy, and good, witty dialogue (not to mention all of the little allusions I caught—TMNT, Army of Darkness, etc.). I liked Sadie as a protagonist quite a bit, and each of the main available guys had their own charm. I appreciated that you can interact with all of the characters/stories even while focusing on your chosen main one and that there are other options to complete the story without chasing after a guy. I’ve finished all of the romance routes, and I’m still playing.The gameplay I found challenging, but not so challenging I wanted to quit. I can see how a casual gamer used to more straightforward/simple gameplay may be unhappy, but for someone like me who also likes strategy and RPG, I’d count this as a bonus. And...well, to put it simply, I think the stories are worth the effort.Overall, I think it’s definitely worth the $—especially if you want something with a little more meat than your typical VN/otome.

												Very fun visual novel with more freedom and options than are standard for the genre and tons of replayability.  In Scheherazade, you play as a brilliant girl archaeologist/explorer from a distinguished family in her first year of college (basically, a young female Indiana Jones).  The game will take you to several locations around the world, each with its own set of missions and tasks from which to choose.  Each story or side mission will have a series of ""obstacles"" to overcome, each of which can usually be tackled using a couple of different approaches, depending on which stats you've been favoring.  You raise your stats at various locations around town (unlike most visual novels, which have 3-5 stats, there are probably 30+ stats here), but there's also a twist on this mechanic: in addition to your permanent personal stats, you can also obtain ""inspirations,"" which are essentially cards that will give you a one-time boost to certain stats.  Inspirations vary in type and quality, so it will be up to you to explore each location for the best combinations! I really enjoyed the story and characters.  Although the plot in certain mission lines can get rather convoluted, it's always a fun ride when Sadie's at the helm.  Some scenarios just plain made me smile. :)Since this is a visual novel at heart, the gameplay consists of reading, making choices in menus and maps, etc.  The game takes place over one year of in-game time, and there are so many different quests and branches from which to choose, it's not possible to see everything in one playthrough, even on Easy difficulty.  Although there is a charming tutorial, expect to spend your first couple of in-game weeks flailing about and generally failing objectives as you get accustomed to the flow of the game.  There are multiple romance-able characters, but even if you choose not to romance a certain character (or any of the characters), full friendship routes are still available, so the characters don't totally disappear from the game like in some visual novels.  This means that, while I enjoyed the romance aspect, even if you choose to remain single, you still get a complete gaming experience.  I just finished my first playthrough, which took about 19 hours, and I'm looking forward to jumping right into a second to explore some of the content I missed the first time around!  As far as technical things go, the location maps are super impressive, the menus are well-done, and character art is generally good (although the CGs are not always great).  The music is lively and era-appropriate; at the beginning of the game, it really impressed me.  As the hours wore on, though, it did get rather repetitive, so a few more tracks might've been nice.  I noticed that a few lines of dialogue seemed to have the wrong speaker's name on the text box, but this was rare, and the only bug-like thing I encountered (trouble getting achievements to register) was promptly fixed by the developer a couple of days after launch, so everything seems to be very stable.To summarize, Scheherazade is a fun, extremely meaty visual novel game that oozes atmosphere and charm and even manages to incorporate a considerable degree of strategy in the form of stat-management mechanics.  Recommended for fans of VNs and those who want to explore a girl-Indiana Jones-type plot full of adventure!			"

												This game is Indiana Jones, film noir, and comedic hijinks all in one. The last time I loved a game like this, I was playing a AAA title. 15 seconds in I was chuckling and didn't stop until 3 am when I made myself go to bed.Pros:-protagonist  is fun, capable, and witty-lots of palatable history (if you like history) and myth (you probably like myth)-refreshingly novel feel of 1930's, complete with 1930s slang (lots of moxie to go around)-refreshingly novel best friendship that feels genuine, when best frindship between girls is often overlooked.-supporting characters, from protagonist's best friend to one-time side character to the antagonists, feel like real people who have lives off-stage. I cannot say this enough: CHARACTERS ARE AMAZING.-the ""map"" interfaces for the different locations are beautiful, and really help immersion-the adventures around the world really do capture the essence and culture of their locations-high replayability (because there's no way you're going to get to do all the adventures in a location in one playthrough)-love interests are actually interesting--and entirely optional! A satisfying ending is achieved no matter what.-romances are not half as cheesy as they could have been, especially for the medium-witty exchanges everywhere (but does not interfere with serious scenes). Unless slapstick is your thing, you will be very amused.Cons:-art is not the best, but passable and overshadowed by other good stuff-New York music is repetative, but you get a break when going abroad-story is a bit convoluted, and the ending is morally grey, but it was interesting-lots of text, but usually enjoyable to read--at least in the first playthrough-the skillchecks are difficult, and take a lot of getting used to to find a good strategy, but not impossible, and still usually fun. (I recommend writing down what checks come up on an adventure beforehand)If you don't like history, you won't like this game, but you don't need to know history to have a good time. I am desperately hoping for a sequel.Abducted by creol pirates, toured New York with a mummy, BFFs with a bedouin, 10/10 would play forever.			"

												Scheherazade is one of the more involved otome games I've played in a while. In this one, you play as Sadie, an aspiring archaeologist, as she goes on adventures in various locations around the world. Like many similar games, you have a year to build-up certain skills in order to achieve the best ending on the route you choose. Unlike others, you also have a card based element to the game. In order to successfully pass an adventure, you need to not only build-up your skills but also gather cards (or inspirations as they're called in the game) to play during the capers. This involves some strategic thinking, which I loved since in a lot of otome games the skills building can get a little monotonous when you're just spamming a certain trait.  I also love the time period (1931), supernatural elements, and that you don't have to chose a romance route in order to get a good ending. However, the romance options are wonderful. So far I've loved the ones I've played through. My only frustration is that it's near impossible to figure out how to get someones best ending. All in all, this is a really great game.			"

												It's hard to focus on what might be a decent (if somewhat scattered) story when the gameplay is such a distracting, frustrating slog.  The stat building is just awful, mostly because there's way, way too many stats and they level far more slowly than the game hikes the difficulty of the skill checks.  To add insult to injury, the game will frequently heap penalties on you before you even get a chance to react.  Even on easy I failed far more tests than I passed, and it felt like that was intentional on the part of the developers.  Maybe they thought that would be challenging, but it was only disheartening.It's a pity.  I liked the art style and the main character and setting were interesting.			"

												So this game is and isn't all I'd hoped it to be. As some people have previously mentioned, the game is clunky as all get out. The skill system took me a while to understand, and even longer to fully use to my advantage. There is an unpredictability about events, as well, and not the good kind. Let me give you an example: Say you want to do an adventure with Roland in Egypt. Okay, cool. It says the skills you need are Grace, Escape Artistry, Dodge, Problem Solving, and Perception. So you beef up those stats a little, maybe add some inspirations (they act as booster cards for your stats) and then you start the adventure. Well halfway through the damn thing,  the game, through no fault of your own, forces the stress to go up about 9 points. (When the stress is high the ability to overcome obstacles in the game is greatly impeded.) So basically, even though it says you'll need Perception, the game never tells you HOW MANY perception points you'll need. And you may end up using all your inspiration cards to overcome one stupid hurdle in the adventure. But that is only one problem in the game.  The other one, the major one I'm dealing with right now, is that you need to have your relationship points up to at least 30 with a bachelor by Christmas, or no ending with that bachelor for you. But the problem is, say you're courting Ahmose, the Mummy Dude, and you only get ONE opportunity to woo him by Christmas. Right now, I'm in November and I have only seen one adventure with Ahmose available, and that was in Egypt. My points with him are at an 11 right now, and I definitely won't get to 30 by Christmas. However, I have seen other people court him with no problem. Are the capers (the adventures) randomized? I've never seen an Ahmose adventure beside the one in Egypt so how the hell am I to get him to 30 points. Other than this, I can tell you I love this game. In the last few days I've spent almost all my time on it. But DAMN its got some serious issues. I would like a clear understanding of how the game works but, seeing as there is very little out there in the way of guides and other such things, I think I might just have to restart the game and figure it out.

												I  first played this game  before it was released on steam. I still have  that copy. I enjoy it very much.  We follow Sadie, a daughter of famous archeologists, during her archology studies and the adventures she gets into. It's adventurous, it is humorous, the setting is refreshing, it's sparkling and fun.  I have a great sense of adventure. It s a stat raising game. I LOVE stat raising games and this one  makes  stat raising really functional by having trials you need to overcome on a path of choice.  The game combines so many things, and you can choose ""routes"" to change Sadie's  ""dream"". I love that. It guarantees replayability, making the game fun each and every time.  My favourite paths for Sadie is Nigel because I really love the character and find him well matched and I trully enjoy the progress and the adventures Nofel and Sadie get into all the time.     In most otomes you chose a route. Here in this game that skillfully combnes elements known to me from  otome, visual novel, stat raising and adventure games, you can LITERALLY chose a route and then follow it thorugh in various locations Sadie travels to as part of her quests. Storywise, a lot of effort went into this because whle the game has an overarching story of Sadie, it branches out into so many paths you can have Sadie follow, it's really incredible for me. I love the sense of travel and adventure!  Also, the many endings you can achieve depending on the fullfilmment of the dream points and depending on difficulty levels make it really enegaging.Sadie is a really nice main character, intelligent, spunky (if a little reckless sometimes?), kind, polite, educated, has a strong presence and I do care for her. I really enjoy travelling and adventuring with her. The design is interesting, we chose adventures and activities from various maps and the maps are varied. when an adventure ends, it shows up as a newspaper heading. Those little touches make it so much more fun. Because this game has so many elements to it, I never feel bored and never have a sese of routine. It's exciting all the time for me. This is such a thoroughly engaging and fun game for me. I have been told there is a sequel planned that will continue from the ending chosen by the player. I generally don't like sequels but I look forward to this one as I really like the characters, the setting, the great flow of the text, engaging stories and setting and stat raising. There is really a LOT packed into this game and it is a real keeper for me among the many games I ever purchased in my life. I enjoy it when I can. I have had this game for a few years already  and I still haven't reached 100% completion. It's immersive, it's fun, humorous and adventurous and one of my best purchases ever, a game I really love for the sense of great fun and adventure and extremely rich content. It feels like a genuine labour of love and it is very fun to play.			"

												In this game you play as Scheherazade (Sadie) - a young woman, passionate about adventures and archaeology. It's visual novel (story-oriented game with choices), but there is also stat raising aspect (important, allows to move story forward). It's pretty challenging.Is this game for everyone? Definitely no. If you don't like stat raising aspect, you'll probably get bored very quickly. Also, if you're looking just for romance story, this is probably not the best choice. Don't get me wrong, romance is there and it's good, but story is so much more complex (which is awesome for me, but not for everyone). It's pretty good written, it has interesting characters and allow you to choose how to act in certain situations (though, most of the time, it didn't really felt like it had any real impact). All of potential romance options are intriguing (but mummy for the win!) and likable. As for protagonist... Well. I like her, but she has pretty annoying moments and I can imagine that some people may not find this as charming and funny as I did.Pros:+ game length + many routes+ many adventures+ good writing+ good graphic+ interesting and deep characters+ challenging...?Cons:- ... too challenging, I'm afraid, especially if you decide to play your first game on normal (or higher) difficulty. I can imagine that constant failures can scare some people off- stat raising aspect - I personally like it, but I think it may be a little over complicated for most people and, to be honest, some stats didn't really seemed very useful- some adventures seemed to be dragging too much, while other felt a little bit rushed.

												Scheherazade is not a good game. Among several small sins, there are two parts that absolutely sink a what otherwise could be an interesting title:-	The Game Mechanics. Oh the game mechanic. Never have I toiled so hard to accomplish so little. At first it looks like the game offers several character paths to embark upon, depending on the skill set, but quickly you realize the Difficulty checks are so high, and the base state increases are so low, your only reliable way of passing tests is getting a random selection of ANY skills to max, and then spamming the aspirations they drop for the general bonus to every other check. It’s so incredibly unrewarding, it made me lose all will to progress, which was already dwindling because of….-	The Main Character. Jesus Christ the Main Character. She has all the traits of a Mary Sue, while also having no actual character traits. She’s incredibly intelligent, adventurous,  “witty”, ""loveable"", headstrong – and a heiress to a fortune, of “pure heart”, and with a mysterious destiny before her. She’s so absolutely impossible to relate to, I cannot comprehend how can any of the characters (or players) stand her. Oh, and I forgot - she's also an ambitious independent woman in an age of inequality. How revolutionary! But fear not, when the situation strikes, when romance needs to happen, she has no qualms about tossing it all away to ask in a quivering voice “M-m-mummy-sama, c-can I grab your h-hand so we don’t get l-lost in the dark?”Yeah, there is a Mummy in the game. The MC doesn’t seem to be all that phased by that fact. I guess I can see why, since the Mummy isn’t all that particularly interesting. None of the characters seem too interesting, even the romance choices. In a visual Novel. But I guess that might be just my opinion.But anyway, add to all that some minor other annoyances, like dialogue choices not making any actual difference, bland art, cluttered interface, convoluted plot, and you got yourself a game that dreamt big, but fails to deliver on every possible level. Not worth the time, IMO.			"

												This game looks like a good Visual Novel, but it's in fact more of a management or stats builder than a Visual Novel itself.As a Visual Novel, the story is pretty interesting and inspiring... but the text is truly heavy and the game soundtrack is repetitive. As the game is a bit long (20h+ for one gameplay), you probably will get bored before finishing your first playthrough just as I did.It isn't a bad game at all but I don't think it truly worth it's full price.

												An intriguing story which is well crafted with nice stylized graphics. I got much more invested in the story than I thought I would and I found Sadie a likeable strong female lead. I also think that some of the enjoyment I got from this game came from the fact that I love stories about archeological splunking during the early times of archeology.I think that if you are a fan of films such as ""The Mummy"" or the Indiana Jones franchise, you will like this game.

												Lower than average VN, honestly. The only thing I enjoyed was the characters' personalities and most of the dialouge. The stat building is slow, drawn out,  and there's too many stats in a game that requires you to level out pretty much ALL of them if you want the ability to do all the actions you want to do.The game requires to have stats over a certain level to successful do some actions. Honestly, the best way to do it was to use cards that give you bonuses. However, using cards for stat bonuses were frustrating since it would be through luck or walkthrough if you had the right one. There's too many stats and the cards only brought up 2-3 stats significatlly.  Not to mention, after the first few choices, you hit areas where the required stat levels are too high for just one of your cards. It was an interesting mechanic, but probably would've been more fun if the cards held more stats to give more of a chance to have one that worked for the situation. Dialouge more often than not seemed to cut off and feel incomplete as well despite the clear hard work they must've put into it.Traveling in a VN and the cards with stat bonuses are very interesting elements and it could've very well this VN into a gem. However, it still need to be properly balanced, along with the stats in general, to be an effect part of the game.			"

Amazingly detailed and packed full of story.Otome's usually aren't as fleshed out as this one is, in regards to story. This tale involves a lot of intelligence and engaged me all the way till the end. As far as the amount of content, for an Otome game, I would consider this to be one of the longest I've ever played... and I've only gotten ONE ending so far (note: the amount of time put into this game currently is 45 hours or so). I do think some scenarios were overused, but intriguing nonetheless. Definitely consider purchasing this game if you are a fan of mysteries, building relationships, or story telling in general. You won't regret it! (I do suggest playing on EASY though. Normal is EXTREMELY challenging).			"

												Ok I want to start off with the fact that I am highly intrigued by the storyline as I love Ancient History. I also love that this story is based in the 1930s and it has great artwork that is very different from other visual novels. I got this game on sale for about $6 and I am glad I did, because although I do love aspects of this game (i.e the artwork, plot, and setting)...it is quite difficult to actually understand how to play. Not only do you have to gain skills but you have to get dream inspirations that I am not really sure what they do. I am going to keep playing although I will be using a walkthrough to see if I can get a better grasp on how this game actually works. I will update my review again once I finish the game. ***For those wanting to try this game, I recommend buying it now while its on sale***			"

												A zany young woman gets around doing archaeology - hijinks & romance ensue. Although they aren't romances like what's in a Bioware game, it's more like one character becomes your most valuable friend. The rest of this review is isn't so much a review as it is a public service announcement explaining what this game is. Basically, this is a visual novel with a huge amount of dialog to click through, also, there is the RPG/Stat-Raising/card-game thing which kinda sucks. So as you read through the dialog driven scenes there are skill checks you pass (to gain small stat increase) or fail (increases a penalty stat makes tests a little harder), although whether you pass or fail the scene will still happen.The skill checks take the form of a card mini-game where the passing score is achieved by adding cards to your baseline score (your collected cards have 2-4 different bonuses on them). Once the scene is over you can replenish the cards you have used by going around town (""seek inspiration""). If you have high skill stat or a high relationship stat with a particular character then the cards you get from them are very good - I think, I'm not exactly sure. Alternately you can increase your stats (""boost"") although I didn't feel much of pressing a need when the baseline bonus is so small even when at max. And there are many stats to increase, something like 20 different stats. Of course, the most important thing to do in town is to ""go on adventures with..."" the other characters (once you have enough cards available).As for the art, it's great for a steam visual novel with lovely backgrounds and nice characters with many expression transitions. The soundtrack is swinging bepop jazz which is a little repetitive, but I didn't mind. Also, Steam Achievements won't work offline.1931: Scheherazade at the Library of Pergamum is a great story game with RPG element that kinda sucks is a worthwhile purchase when it is on sale. It's a must purchase if you love stories with strong female protagonists.			"

												This game is really good one time through because it's very long and packs a lot of story content. + Excellent character interaction+ Well written dialogue, great humor+ Long play time with multiple interweaving stories. Overwhelming at times.+ Music is nice and atmospheric.+ Choices open up alternative paths, such as skipping skill checks.+/- Art is ok. The sprites are ok. The ending CGs are kinda meh. It looks really flat overall.- Text heavy. This game is meant to be played in breaks because there is too much information to digest. A lot of stuff flew over my head. I would have LOVED a term library- such as what Hakuoki uses, so that I could have had a better understanding of the archaeology terms and of the time period.- The romance endings end with cliffhangers hinting at a sequel.- No scroll back to see missed dialogue. Quick load is useless. It goes to the load menu instead of auto loading your quick save. The skip/quick save/quick load are inexplicably hidden at the bottom right corner in TINY MOLECULAR FONT.- The menus are clunky. It was easier writing down dates in a notepad. There are no warnings about automatic events, unless you write down the specific dates.- Stats are complex. There are too many stats and not enough time to pass events.Here is a breakdown:- Stats are valued at 100 = 10. To pass events, you need to pass a 10+ score. 5+ stress increases that number.- You use +skill cards to make up the rest of your score.Example: Checkpoint says 23 Occult Lore // 100 Occult Lore = 10 points // 1 card has +13 General and +7 Occult Lore = 20 Occult Lore // base score 10 + card score 20 = your score 30- On Easy difficulty, the highest checkpoint (Turkey, Dream, and Main events) goes to 65+ (5-15 stress). On Hard difficulty (or a lot of stress) goes well over 100+- Individual events are grouped into 4-10 checkpoints. Checkpoints use diversely different stats. You have to know ahead of time which stats to work on first.- The game lets you carry 10 cards initially. To increase your carry limit, you need to successfully pass Dream/Main Events. Passing them rewards you with great cards (20-90 general)- There are time limited sections. You must constantly cycle through raising a stat, farming cards, passing events, passing hidden automatic checkpoints, lowering stress, and repeat to the next section.- Skills are grouped under trees. The tree has a separate 100 value. A high tree score makes it faster to train the skills under that tree. You can only earn tree points passing certain checkpoints and dialogue choices. It's NOT randomized, but there are NO complete guides so you literally need to make your own walkthrough to know what checkpoints give out what skills and tree points.Example: Occult Lore is under Wits. // 100 Wits = +10 Occult Lore w/ stat raising // Spend 10 turns raising Occult Lore to 100In conclusion, the game was too text heavy for my tastes on top of a difficult stats system that I couldn't really enjoy myself.If you are a completionist, this game will leave you unfulfilled. Stats and achievements are still bugged, including some that effect which endings you get. There are no complete guides and with so many endings, you will not see all of them.			"

It seems fair when you sell a game to have a proper composer and sound designer. It's really boring and it brake the ambiance._ the background... it's always purple... always the same... always always always... Your character go to university : purple background. She is in her aunt's house : purple background. Train station : purple background... well... life is purple background._ Too much blabla... sometimes it's fun but mostly all the good information, what's important are just somewhere in the blablabla.

												It is too bad this game didn't fly with me, I was really excited to play it. But it has some problems.Firstly, the art style is bland, and I feel it can be done better. Secondly, the music is a bit painful. The music choices they made for this game were really bad. It seems out of all of the types of music from the 30's they had to choose the most annoying boring and repetitive songs. Lastly, the storytelling is rather awful, the main character is unlikable, and there are no menus showing stats or anything so you are going off pretty blindly.			"

												Outstanding game if you like a combination of VN and stat-builder.  The game is huge and the characters are very engaging.  My favourite thing about the game is the writing, which is both witty and intelligent - love the humour!  Also, the research that went into the game in terms of both archeological and time period/setting information is terrific.  I was impressed how much I learned and how much I enjoyed the learning!A couple of things to note:  the game is challenging, even on Easy mode, so you do need to pay attention to the stat building and be willing to make decisions about how you want the story to develop; the game is long, so creating strategic saves for when you want to go back and try an alternate path is a good idea.  This isn't a 2-3 hour game, and for those of us who want to do everything perfectly on the first go it can be frustrating at times.There are two things missing to make this a 10/10 game:  a way to track key scenes and endings (there is no gallery, which is a real shame - so take screen shots); a sequel (1932 was promised back in 2012/13, before this game made it to Steam, and now that I've played 1931 I want it!!).A real gem of a game for those with a bit of patience - some of the best writing I've ever seen in the genre.  9.5/10			"

												One of the few visual novels that is worth the full price (though I did buy it on sale). It's long - I've only completed the game one and half times as of this review. And there's a ton of options and opportunities to make real choices that have an impact. The stat-building and obstacle system is complicated at first, unnecessarily so, but it all makes sense once you get the hang of it. It doesn't have a ton of depth, but if you're playing for the story/characters, it's not a big deal.Very well-written, though the main character definitely is a Mary Sue, she's far better than the majority of female protagonists of visual novels. She's fun, and funny, and totally assertive. Plus, the choices you select really do allow you to give her a personality of your choice. The love interests and other side characters are great - all well-written, very distinctive, and fun to interact with. Even though this game takes awhile to get through, I think it'll be worth a replay to get at least one more romance.			"

												The interface could use some work and the skills could have been cut down by half, but otherwise, I love this game! It's cute and quirky with a fun storyline and great characters.I will say that you shouldn't try to do everything, this will just lead to headaches. Choose a dream for Sadie early (whether it be one of the five guys or family) and do capers related to your goal first. If you have enough game time left to do other things, do them, otherwise skip them. My first playthrough I was trying to do all the capers and ended up frustrated. My second go around I only did capers realted to the guy I had Sadie pursuing and the main story, leaving tons of time to stat build and gather inspirations. (This obviously does not apply if you're trying to get certain 'do everything' achievements.)If you love stat building Visual novels, this might be the game for you. Unfortunately, Sadie is mostly surrounded by men and does not have a same-sex option, if that's what you're looking for. The story is still great on its own without the romance!			"

												I absolutely, positively adore this game without reservation. I bought it on a whim, it looked interesting, and I haven't been able to stop playing it. The way I've been describing it to people is a ""The Mummy-esque dating sim"", but it's really so much more than that! It reminds me a lot of: The Mummy, Young Sherlock Holmes, Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries, but it's also very unique and isn't a derivative of any of those. You can play through it and completely ignore the dating sim aspects, or you can focus solely on one gentleman at a time and have a completely different gameplay each time.Pros: 1) Very well written, I found very few errors & the dialogue very rarely felt forced2) Humourous, very tongue-in-cheek, great meta references, good at making fun of itself without getting repetitive, great timing3) Very well-planned stories, similar themes without being repetitive (you can't play through one guy's story and then know how the other guys are going to play out)4) Stories integrate very well, each story arc gives you more and different information about the other arcs5) Characters have good depth, you don't have to restrict your responses (for the most part) just to get the right amount of points with your chosen guy, so you can choose what you want for Sadie (with a few exceptions)6) Well-drawn characters (a bit repetitive, but not so much that it's bothersome)7) Great music, I find myself whistling the main theme a lot8) Long-ish, even if I ""speed through"" plots I've done before, it still takes me a good afternoon/evening to get through a  new storyline9) Stat spamming can get obnoxious but once you understand how to get around it, goes relatively quickly10) Very personable characters, even when they're trope characters, they've got more depth than you'd expect, and I'm overly-attached to all of them by nowThe only real con I have is that the stat spamming is a little too involved. I think it could be cut down, the instructions could be expanded a little, and it would be nice if the point gains for the main categories (+wits/charm/athletics/etc) were more predictable; as it is, you pretty much have to make a ""map"" of the point games and replay solely to try to max those categories, which I don't feel is ideal. However, this doesn't affect my gameplay at all, and in no way interrupts my enjoyment of the game.There ARE cliffhangers (from minor to large) in each guy's ending, however. I know there's talk of a 1932 but I don't know if/when it's going to happen, so keep that in mind if cliffhangers bother you.			"

												Scheherazade at the Library of Pergamum is a gem of a game that works like a cross between a deck building and management game and a visual novel. You follow the heroine (let's call her Sadie), a New York scion and a junior year student of archaeology, in a series of adventures around the world that brings her in touch with a huge cast of characters. You spend game time between raising your many stats and collecting ""inspiration"" cards, which will help you move through the various capers that form the plot of the game. Sadie is part Indiana Jones and part manic pixie, and has both a deep passion for archaeology and a knack for attracting trouble. Sounds familiar? Though the story draws from every possible cliche (from the tragically lost parents to your typical temples of doom), it manages to come through as smart, humourous and engaging. The designers gave a lot of attention in capturing the mood of the period, both in the game's writing and its amazing soundtrack.Note that despite its visual novel feel, the game is quite challenging. To resolve each caper, Sadie must pass through a number of checks that depend on her skill level and her card inventory. Difficulty rises very fast, and the player must plan ahead from day 1 (most plot lines advance even in failure, but some do not, and how successful you are impacts the game ending). To complicate the situation, the skill system is far from balanced (but far from broken, as well), and the game doesn't make a good job of explaining what you need to be doing. I personaly enjoying the difficult aspects of the game, but I can understand that strategizing and number-crunching may not appeal to everyone. The price may also be an issue; I got the game in a 50% discount, and I think it was totally worth the money,So if you like visual novels, enjoy the grand adventure movies of old, and don't mind a little (or a lot of) challenge, this game is for you.

It's a very deep creative game, and it takes a pretty long time to beat it, and not usually because of, hm, ""grinding"" per se, but actually because it has a large quantity of story, and you have a lot of freedom as to which parts of the story you'd rather pursue.

												I am fairly new to visual novels, but I really liked this game. The characters are lovable, the story is well written, but may not interest those who do not like history. The gameplay is a little more complex for a visual novel, but I found it wasn't hard for me, since I play a lot of RPGs. 1931: Scheherazade... also gives you a lot of freedom and options in contrast to a standard visual novel.The music was a little repetitive, I admit, and art was also lacking, but overall I'm happy that I decided to buy this game.

												The endings are pretty much cliffhangers - there should be another game, but nowhere near for now. So there are plenty lose ties and plotholes left.But still, I enjoyed it quite a lot (aside from the statgrinding... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ). Recomended, but on sale			"

												One of the few visual novels that is worth the full price (though I did buy it on sale). It's long - I've only completed the game one and half times as of this review. And there's a ton of options and opportunities to make real choices that have an impact. The stat-building and obstacle system is complicated at first, unnecessarily so, but it all makes sense once you get the hang of it. It doesn't have a ton of depth, but if you're playing for the story/characters, it's not a big deal.Very well-written, though the main character definitely is a Mary Sue, she's far better than the majority of female protagonists of visual novels. She's fun, and funny, and totally assertive. Plus, the choices you select really do allow you to give her a personality of your choice. The love interests and other side characters are great - all well-written, very distinctive, and fun to interact with. Even though this game takes awhile to get through, I think it'll be worth a replay to get at least one more romance.			"

												I got this game on sale but it's easily worth full price. I got 31 hours in but I haven't finished with everythng yet because the game is really big.Pros:* This is a huge game. There's a lot of storylinesand routes that Sadie can take.* 5 romanceable options * Story driven. It's not really the romance that defines this game. It's Sadie and her journey as an aspiring archaelogist.* Spirited MC. I loved Sadie's personalityCons* Lack of backgrounds. There's just one background for every city. It could do with some variation. Personally, it didn't bother me a lot but this might bother some people.* Stats building. I generally don't like stat building games but I made an exception for this one since I liked it. It might be a tedious and boring grind for some people, though.All in all, I really liked this game. I loved the story, the plot(s), the characters, and the 1930s setting. It's not for everyone as some aspects of the game might turn off some people. For those who can look past its flaws, this game can be incredibly rewarding.			"

												This game is very much like Long Live The Queen. Except WAY too complicated! It takes much too long to raise your skills so you can play the games Capers, I'm not expecting to become an expert in something in just a few clicks, but God! And you only have a few spots for Inspirations (stat boosting cards) which means if you're trying to raise a stat you're most likely going to one or two spots so you don't fill up your Inspirations too fast. I can't say anything about the ending, because this game was so boring/frustrating I didn't even finish the first in-game month. In short, at it's 24.99 price tag, it is NOT WORTH IT.			"

												While the stats system is not quite to my tasts, the writing is great and the characters very likeable. The romances are also very sweet and I particularly enjoyed how all the individual stories came together in the end. Well, all except one, which was of course the one I chose to with on my first try. The Ahmose path really seems like it doesn't fit with all the others, like it might have been some tacked on DLC. Maybe don't start with that path.			"

												I was thinking to not recommending this despite how much I absolutely love the premise, but after reading around the reviews a bit I agree on something.This is a good VN with bad RPG/stat management system tacked.Too bad about that. I was hoping for an RPGish stat management game, that's why I was disappointed, but if you look past it and just think of it as VN, it's pretty enjoyable.Also I realized that I should focus more on collecting inspiration rather than stats, so there's that.But anyway, premise, character, and writing, are absolutely my catnip. Gameplay is not.			"

												The game get's pretty intersting once you get used to it and don't mind minimal visuals with a lot (a real lot) of just text reading.I like the stories and characters but there's so much to do you have to choose wisly. My current game record is just from my first playthrough following Nigel's path and ignoring the others aside from Sadie capers.Annoying things: Too many stats even for a stat raising game. At some point it doesn't matter if you maxed out your stats because what you need is card collecting strategy. Seriously, it's how you play your cards right in the end, collect the best cards and use them when needed since the level you need to pass is 20-50 while the max stat is 10 (and that's on easy mode)As stupid hard the gameplay is I still think it's good for it's very large content.

												This review is from the perspective of an imaginary 12-year-old girl. If you're bad at sarcasm, you may want to skip this review. (No offense intended to actual 12-year-old girls who are nothing like this.)This game is really awesome! I wish my life was life Sadie's, when the game starts she is graduating from high school on her 18th birthday so now she can do whatever she wants and she's rich and her best friend Anna is really nice and her aunt that takes care of her is funny and all the boys like her and she's really smart and she goes on all these adventures!I like how the story is told in one or two sentences at a time so it's not too hard to read. Then you can just click your mouse and read the next part. After about ten screens you have to decide somthing, and what happens depends on what you decide! Sometimes you get a challenge where you have to be good at something, and those are really hard, but even if you don't pass the challenge it's okay.This story is set in 1930 and 1931. I heard that people were depressed a lot during those times but it's nice that none of the depressing people are in this game. I am learning lots of history from this game.The art is really good. The screen has a cartoon picture of Sadie and whoever she's talking to on it all the time. They have different faces depending on whatever just happened! I like the music too so I'm glad they play the same songs over and over.It is fun to replay this to see what happens if you make different decisions. The introduction when Sadie graduates and stuff is mostly the same so it's like I get to read my favorite story over and over again.There is even a tutorial after you start but that must be for older kids because I didn't get it.I wrote this review after only playing the game a couple of hours because I love it so much and I want everyone to know they should play this game, if you are like me you will love it too.

												Love this game, despite the negative reviews.  There is some grinding, as there is in many games.  There are cards you can collect to boost your stats during an obstacle, so you have to evenly divide your time between collecting cards, leveling up your stats, improving your relationships, and completing parts of the story.  There is also a diary/calendar that tells you the dates of all the major events in the story, so it isn't unexpected when you leave a city.I'm almost finished my first playthrough; I can't wait to play again.

												It was an interesting concept but poorly executed. There are a ton of little superficial stories that don't really connect and the game-play is tedious. The art is bad, even painful at times. There are no backgrounds pictures during the stories and the music, though good, is limited and doesn't match the tone of any of the scenes.I played for 20 hours before I got sick of it, so sick of it that I didn't even bother to get a single ending. I bought the game for 75% off and played it for a decent amount of time so maybe it would be worth buying for some people. Had I paid full price, I would be upset.			"

												Although tagged here as an RPG and SImulation, this is more like a visual novel than it is like either of those. That said, it's more interesting than any other visual novel I've encountered, and there is more of a ""game"" element to it, due to the cards--inspirations. It's still more text, reading, than anything else though, so if you don't like that, you won't like it. Personally, I really like Sadie, and the writing has gotten a few smiles and one almost laugh out of me so far, even though I haven't gotten that far into it yet.Edited review: I finished this game tonight, after having restarted it completely once because I'm stupid. Anyway, my recommendation for it is now even higher than it was. I loved this. I've played other visual novels and liked them, but this one is far, far, better than any others I've played. It's good enough that having finished it, I won't be removing it from my hard drive. I'll be playing it again to try for different endings, to try to complete things I didn't manage to complete the first time, and just because I really like the characters and the story.			"

												This part-visual novel, part-stats management game is cute, funny, and well-written. There's decent replay value, since you won't be able to do all the quests or achieve all the relationships in a single playthrough (though replays back-to-back get slightly repetitive).But what I really want to commend, as someone who studies history and archaeology, is the game's consideration of preservationists' responsibility to indigenous cultures and artifacts. Who has the right to study/dig up/disrupt ancient sites? Should artifacts be kept on site, in local museums managed by the indigenous populations, or in more affluent and globally-accessible (Western/British/American) museums? While Sadie is generally perfect and above reproach in many ways throughout the game's narrative, she is constantly rebuked by locals for being, as an archaeologist, a glorified thief or treasure hunter. So the game accurately portrays its time period in that way -- that the early 20th century was a time of paternalistic theft by Western archaeologists who didn't trust non-Western cultures to preserve their own history.  So, as a student of history, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this game didn't just glorify archaeology as the discipline of white, Western treasure hunters, but rather critiques exactly that sentiment and the time period in which it's set.

												Unfortunately I would have liked to recommend this game but it`s very unplayable in it`s current state.  Add the flash cards don`t make any sense and you don`t even know why you choose a flash card or what purpose it serves adding to the frustration.  Also I don`t know how to get my skills up and it doesn`t really show you how and you have to do the same things over and over again and you have no idea why you`re doing them.  Days go by in the game and I feel like I haven`t progressed, game doesn`t feel fun and I have a hard time trying to play this game when it`s not very fun, if you`re looking for a something enjoyable without the frustration of the card game that doesn`t make any sense I would recommend either Loren the Amazon Princess or Long Live the Queen.  On the upside this game does have great illustrations and also catchy music, an interesting story I would have liked to get into but the flash cards and the lack of knowing what I was doing to accomplish my goals was just too frustrating for me to continue to play it any longer.
