												This is a game about a piranha/rabbit thing who has a sweet tooth, your goal is to get the cookies/cake/icecream, but you need the help of your little friends to get there.This game is a rube goldberg maker, you try and get the end objective using other things causing a chain reaction, it does this nicely, the whole thing has a nice cute feel. But it does feel a bit like somthing I would play on my ipad.7/10 its a nice game if you like chain reaction/casual games, but it isnt worth $7 if you arent.			"

												The original Eets was a game with a new concept that took the gameplay of Lemmings and narrowed it down to one character, allowing for a lot more room for puzzle solving.Eets Munchies, on the other hand, has you paying $7 for an iPhone style (and quality) game.The resolution is capped in a very weird form that just ensures it was clearly built for mobile (going in fullscreen leads to big black bars on either side), and the system of ""different worlds, few levels, 3 stars"" that can be seen in games like Angry Birds is here.The presentation of Eets is wonderful (even with resolution restraints) but the execution is off. Puzzles are either ridiculously easy or incredibly hard due to countless errors in timing. Think of it like the puzzles in Portal 2 compared to Portal: you understand how to set up the puzzle and you should get it done properly, but if your timing is off than your work is for nothing.Not to mention of course that the only changes since the ""beta"" version were 2 other worlds, one of them being the ""mystery"" world, which is chock-full of those timing oriented puzzles.Too easy, too short, and too little. Maybe buy this on iOS when it's cheaper and they plan on updating with more levels.			"

												Eets is cute as a button so its a shame this is a poop game. It is impossible to recommend this for 7 bucks because its an overpriced app at that point. its weird locked resolution and gameplay design (using the 3 stars per level system) just reinforce that. The levels range from easy (place the items and press go) to pull-out-your-hair hard, but not in the ""Oh, it just requires some advanced logic"" way, but in the  ""Oh, I have to put these in the correct spot DOWN TO THE PIXEL, so I spend time trying to get it correct over and over, despite knowing how to complete the level"" and it just feels unfair sometimes. To the games credit the latter assorment of levels are few in number. But...then again...there aren't a lot of levels to begin with. Eh. Only played this past the 2nd world or so for the easy 100% game.			"

												Eets Munchies is a very short and casual puzzle game. Klei Entertainment does it again with this charming little title.You can expect anywhere between 2-4 hours in this game (more if you tinker with the workshop) with 60 well-made puzzles. The first 36 or so puzzles are not very hard and I noticed that the final quarter of the game has some of the easiest levels ever. Thankfully, the mystery levels provide a decent challenge that can at least stimulate your brain a little bit. I feel that there could have been a little bit more variety if the items given to you weren't pre-determined. There are only a few ways you can solve each puzzle due to these limitations. I guess that's what the workshop is for. Hopefully the built-in puzzle editor will boost the game's difficulty.This game was quite entertaining for the 2+ hours it took to 100%.4/5			"

												Eets Munchies is a little puzzle platformer that reminds me with some elements on the ancient ""Incredible Machines"" games.It feels just like a ordinary Flash/Director game and has funny slapstick music and movements. If you wonder the first start up -  there is no fullscreen. On a full HD resolution you play in a pretty small window. Nevertheless the graphics are cute and original, but sometimes they are distracting you from finding the solution. Your aim is to place special machines or special food for Eets to lead him to the final cake on a rope.It's a short game but fortunately there is a level editor included. So you'll have lots of new levels in further time ...			"

												'Eets Munchies' is the sequel of 'Eets'. It's a terrific painted puzzle game with crazed creatures and gorgeous animations.There are 5 worlds and each world contains 12 levels. The difficulty level is rising with each new world. In every new world you will get new items/creatures to solve the level.If you know the game 'The Incredible Machine', then you know what you can expect from 'Eets Munchies'.The game is not hard to beat and it will not reach the difficulty level of 'The Incredible Machine'.I would have seen a sixth world, where you have to combine all the items/creature activated in the previous worlds.All achievements are easy to collect.Pros:+ gorgeous animations+ crazed items/creatures+ funny idea/concept+ level creator+ Steam Workshop to download levels made by Users+ option to speed up or slow down the animations/movements+ shortcut to start/stop the level (and sometimes other shortcuts)(+ Indie developer)Cons:- short gameplay time- not bloody difficult as 'The Incredible Machine'Recommended, but only if it's on sale, because of the short gameplay time.8/10 "

												Eets Munchies is a puzzle game, which has a large emphasis on ""trial and error"". This game has amazing animations to go along with unique worlds with a range of obstacles and solutions. By the looks of things, this was a touchscreen game brought over to Steam. This isn't a major downside apart from the lack of options to cover simple aspects, with toggling the volume being the only option available..The game provides various challenges, some which are a breeze and other which require you to stop and think. The sound effects within the game are fairly good, though the background music tends to get quite repetitive after a while of listening.The ability for users to create and play levels via the Steam workshop, gives the game a bit more length and fun overall. The colourful art style and the sound effects make it quite an entertaining 2D puzzle game.			"

												OVERALL: 73%Gameplay & Controls: 4/5 ♥sGraphics & Visuals: 4/5 ♥sMusic & Audio: 3/5 ♥sEets Munchies is an adorably animated puzzle game starring a furry white rabbit/flea amalgamation, one which I honestly can't determine if cute or creepy. It's a relatively simple-to-pick up game with basic controls and (for the most part) a friendly interface; this, combined with a gradual learning curve, helps Eets live up to its all-ages claims. It's a surprisingly fun game to play, and I couldn't help but find myself enjoying each level.-Gameplay & Controls-The game revolves around placing a series of wooden platforms and powerups while triggering different mechanisms to help our friend Eets get to a brightly colored cake at the end of each level. Along the way, the player can also grab different candies as a sort of optional collectible; gathering the different collectibles became rather challenging as time went on. While the concept is simple, navigating through each puzzle becomes an overall enjoyable experience. With the addition of Steam Workship, the amount of puzzles for Eets to navigate is essentially endless, which should keep at least a few ingenuous players coming back for more.-Graphics & Visuals-Despite some initial awkwardness, I found Eets to be rather graphically charming. The different machinations and animals he uses to help him on his way are lively and animated, and I couldn't help but fall in love with the Inhale Whales. Each individual World is visually different, and in some cases rather distinctive, although I have to say that I didn't much like the desert motiff of World Two. However, the game gives off an aura of 2D eye-candy after one's intial impressions, so I have to say I'm rather sold on most of the designs.-Music & Audio-The tracks in Eets Munchies are rather upbeat and whimsical, although after making it few the first world or two they start to become repetitive. They're overall quite enjoyable, and they certainly add some appropraite ambience for some an adorable title, but one could have hoped for a bit more diversity as far as music goes.-Final Thoughts-Overall, Eets Munchies is a rather enjoyable yet simple experience for the casual puzzle gamer. It's fun and charming, and has a learning curve suitable for just about everyone. I have to say that I wasn't planning on liking the game at all when I first started playing, but it ended up winning me over within the first ten levels, and I found myself striving for every collectible. I think it's worth getting if just to play in some spare time, although I wouldn't say it's meant to be experienced in long sessions as it can struggle as far as holding one's interest. Ultimately, the game is surprisingly fun to play, and I have to say that I would recommend.			"

												Grab your knifen fork, eet's Munchies time! You're Henk Munchmouth, a ♥♥♥♥ing rabbit thing on a quest for yummy treats and sugary sweets, but it's not as easy as going to Old Man Mortimer's Candy Corner and getting a free handful of Reese's Pieces if you give him an Old-Fashioned behind the cotton candy machine. No, this game takes hand and eye coordination. Hop, stomp, and munch your way through five delicious worlds and 60 levels that will tantalize your taste, sight, sound, and mindbuds with cute and quirky characters, excellent cartoony landscapes, a peppy Pixar credits-esque soundtrack, and, of course, super clev' puzzies that will strain your brain more than the constant barrage of questions levelled at you from a drove of pigs who refuse to believe that a young, handsome boy and an old candysmith could find real, lasting love in this crazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ world.

Eets Munchies ReviewI originally got this game when it was in beta through a Humble Bundle a little while ago. I believe I tried it once and then just never got around to playing it more. When I first tried Eets Munchies I instantly fell in love with the cartoony style and feel of the game. The music is very fitting and also enjoyable to listen to. That was back in the Beta, now that it has been updated I have to say that I am very impressed. I am so glad I thought of starting this game up again just to see that it now had achievements and steam workshop support to make your own levels! I can definitely see myself playing this for hours just trying to get all the treats in every level.As for the gameplay, it is a very relaxing and casual indie game with 48 regular levels in 4 differently themed worlds plus a mystery world which has 12 unlockable levels which are significantly more difficult than the other levels in the game. While playing the game you get introduced to a bunch of different mechanics that spice up the puzzle solving quite a bit. The gameplay is very enjoyable and I like the fact that you can switch between three different speeds ranging from slow to fast.The controls and puzzle maker are great and the animation is bloody fantastic. I recommend this game to anyone who is looking for or want to play a casual and extremely enjoyable game. The concept of having 3 treats to collect in every level and the more treats you collect the more items you unlock in the puzzle maker is great and it makes for a very nice and a little bit addicting game to play when you want to relax from all your hardcore competitive fps shooters(am I right?). To sign this review off I feel like I need to state that as a person who is a little bit of an achievement junkie or whatnot this game is absolutely worth it, even if it wouldn't have had achievements I would still have recommended it. Although we all love achievements so what is there to complain about? Some people might say that 6,99€ or your regional equivalent is too much to ask for but I don't think so, in my honest opinion this game is worth atleast 7€. My advise is that you should buy this as soon as you get a chance to, but if you don't want to then don't ;)- Liam			"

-Quick Review-Eets Munchies is a puzzle game that has good humor, fun challenges (however not very challenging… there were a few good ones though) easy achievements, and just a good game to play if you have a few hours to burn. I’d recommend this type of game for a phone, or small portable device.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: Your goal is to help Eets (the little white bug looking creature) reach the end of the level, you want to collect the 3 food items also, as an extra challenge. As you collect the food and the cake at the end of the level you unlock items you can use in your own Steamworkshop puzzles.  Game Play: The game itself felt like an app I would play on an apple computer inside the computer store. The buttons themselves actually look like ones used on Angry Birds, so I’m pretty sure that’s how you should be playing this game, but it worked flawlessly with my mouse.It’s a point and click game, that about sums it up. Before you start the game you are given a select few items to set down, then you play and use those items to help Eets finish the level. Achievements: I had no trouble with the achievements, once I had finished the game as far as I could go (I only had to skip about 4 levels, and still had most of the secret levels left), the rest of the achievements you can look up helpful guides. Basically think of this game as a free “100%” for your steam profile. Pretty neat, I think. :DPrice: Eets Munchies current price is $6.99, I had actually commented to one of my friends “I’m playing a 5 dollar game… this is great xD  “ I had no idea what the actual price was. I acquired this game through a humblebundle but this is the first time that the price has been nearly spot on for the value. You can play games that will eat up (pun not intended) more time for the same price. But this game is asking a fair price. Conclusion: I enjoyed the game, it was short, quick, and to the point. I recommend this game.			"

												You might have this game lying around, whether in your Steam Library or Humble Account, and either way I'd say give it a try if you haven't, it's quite a pleasant puzzle game.The core gameplay of Eets Munchies is very simple - Eets, the white dog-looking guy there, wants the cake, and is very single-minded in this desire. He will walk until he either reaches a wall or obstacle, when he will turn around, or when he reaches a ledge, where he will (usually) jump. This is usually not enough to reach the cake on its own, so you have to help him, using a variety of passive or activated items.These range from wooden platforms/barricades, or items that will change Eets' mood to angry or frightened. The levels are small and only have a few items each, so it's usually fairly easy to tell what the game wants you to do, but it still feels clever when you pull it off, thanks to the nice animation and relaxing soundtrack. There are some physics and timing related puzzles, but they're not too common and usually not so bad. The game's not very long, so maybe get it on a discount if you don't have it, but if you really like puzzles I'd say it's worth full price.			"

												This game is great. Its not too long where you just get sick of it, so it is enjoyable to play all the way through. Also the puzzles are pretty challenging, which makes for some brain teasers and fun to play with another person to figure them out. The only time the game really started to ♥♥♥♥ me off was during the mystery challenges when timing and acuraccy are all of a sudden extremely important. other than that placement and timing of the puzzles is not too big of an issue. Also what kinda had me sold on this game was the art style definelty makes it very inviting and almost appear as a kid game but is still very challenging for everyone. Really enjoyed the creativeness of the different items, and am glad there are so many items to keep the game interesting all the way through. Also the devs did great at coming up with the puzzles some of them are a tad baffeling in my opinion of how they play through. All in all a solid game, worth the price, and fun for all.			"

												If you ever wanted to play a casual puzzle game that is kinda reminds you of angry birds look no further, Eets Munchies is what you are looking for. It shares simmilar art style and sound design as Angry Birds, but instead of blowing up piglets you have to guide a white bunny so he would eat the treats. It's easy to get all 3 treats in first levels, but the further you progress, the more difficult it gets. Unfortunatelly, the only difficult sections in this game are ""mystery Levels"" that you unlock by acing regular levels. After you complete all the regular levels i highly suggest to complete mystery levels which are most satisfying to complete because it takes precise item placement and timing. It is also really good measure to relief stress as the game visuals and sound design keeps you relaxed all the time. Overall 7/10, pretty neat, game that will make you relax. On the side note I would love to see ported to android device.			"

												Don't let the looks fool you, there is nothing silly about this game!You basically need to guide Eets (the white bunny...thingy...) towards the cake. Eets can only walk straight and is dumb enough to jump into pits of certain death. Your task is to basically ""guide him"" to the cake, optionally feeding him other candies, puddings and whatnot on your path. Eath puzzle gives you 3 candies and 1 cake. Whereas you cannot directly interact with Eets, you can change his path by laying down items on the ground (which may modify the scenario or Eets' behaviour). There are 5 ""Worlds"", each with 12 puzzles, the last of which is an extra ""Mystery World"" which does not contain any candies - just the cake.I like to brag that I like puzzle games (and that is true). I got this game (like most) in a bundle and didn't expect much. The cartoon-ish graphics, the silly music and the very concept made this title sound like a child game, but you will quickly be surprised. After the first world you will actually have think quite hard to grab all the candies. As a puzzle game lover, I found every single puzzle fair and reasonable, no ""dirty tricks"" needed.Sadly the replayability value is low.The achievements are well designed and flow naturally with the game, but sadly they don't add any extra challenge that the game does not already naturally offer.The Linux port is flawless.Go and get it if you like puzzles.

												Incredibly charming and fun puzzle game from the devs behind Shank and Mark of the Ninja. Think of it as a mix between Lemmings and Mario vs DK (if you've played those on DS/3DS). While it is relatively short (even if you're not so amazing at puzzle games, the game offers a useful hint system that will help you piece your way through levels), unless you download a lot of workshop levels, it's well worth the 2-4 hours you'll spend with it.

												I have over 600 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews #55 - Eets MunchiesEets Munchies is a puzzle game that took me back to my days playing Lemmings.  You play as Eets and his single-minded quest to get cake.  But Eets is not terribly smart.  In fact he'll happily hop of a ledge into oblivion if you let him.  To avoid that, the trick is to strategically place items that will help Eets get to his goal of eating his cake.   You place these items prior to starting the level.  Some items are simple like planks that you can place for Eets to walkover.  But other items that you place you click to interact with, and these items will interact with the environment.  Take for example the ""Inhale Whale"" which you click on and it will inhale Eets and then exhale him to move him up at an angle.I also was reminded of Angry Birds as I continued to progress through levels and the game would introduce new kinds of items to use that work in different ways.  Another reminder is the way each level has the basic goal of getting to the cake, but also a secondary goal of getting up to 3 additional treats.  It's pretty easy to make it to the cake and progress to the next level, but the game awards you for getting each of the 3 treats as well, which is where the game can get tricky.I adored the art style.  It has a zany cartoon feel, like something I'd see in Ren & Stimpy.  And the sound effects are matched perfectly with the art.  I thought they did some nice work here.  My only complaint is the music starts feeling repetitive after awhile, but as far as complaints go that's pretty minor.One other thing that sets this game apart is the level editor.  I thought this was a really cool touch to add.  The level editor is pretty easy to use, it's basically just drag and drop.  You can build the levels and populate it with the items that you've unlocked from regular play.I definitely appreciated the inclusion of the level editor as I think that helps add replay value.  I remember playing Angry Birds, and never found myself really replaying levels once I beat them.  I definitely would have felt the same about this game, so it's nice to have the level editor to make your own levels, or get your own from Steam Workshop.You might be a little turned off by the price, as there are definitely cheaper puzzle games to be had (particularly on mobile).  But the game is undeniably fun, and given the high potential for replayability, I still think it's a fine value.			"

												Usually I would make a long and detailled review about a game. This time, I don't. Because this game can literally burn in hell for all I care.You know, my first impressions of the game was fine, and it continued on for a while. If the game had ended at the Windy Peaks, I would have given this a positive review. But nooo, it didn't end there. Enter the Mystery levels, where the game designers clearly didn't know anymore how to design a puzzle.Levels that are taped at the end of the game are usually there to test your skills that you have learned throughout the game, and so does this game by putting all the obstacles you have seen into these levels. I'm not complaining there. The problem here is that 90% of the puzzles suck because they weren't created properly.If you know how to solve a puzzle, it shouldn't be a problem. And believe me, I knew how to solve them and where to put the obstacles etc. No, they decided for the final levels that you are required to put the obstacles pixel perfect and that you click on them just at the right millisecond, otherwise you ain't gonna pass. And that, is terrible game design. And let's not forget this Elephant obstable that just does whatever the hell he wants.If it wasn't for the Mystery levels, I would say get this game. But unfortunately, they ARE part of the game, and they bring down the entire game too. Klei Entertainment, I appreciate your work, but if you don't know how to create puzzles, you shouldn't make a puzzle game.			"

												The game is no fun, it's generic and stupidly easy. Why would you play this? And why pay a fiver for it? You can get many better games for a fiver and this represents poor value.Don't buy this game at full price.			"

												I LOVE Eets! I remember when I first found the demo for Eets: Chowdown, and I was in love! This puzzle/thinking game is great for anyone who loves cute and silly things, while wanting a challenge at the same time! Did I mention that YOU can make your own puzzles in this game? Yeah, it's that awesome! This is why this game should win an award!			"

												Eets is a game about a little white... whatchamacallit thingy named Eets who is very hungry, and changes his walking behaviour via emotions: Happy, he'll just plod along at a leasurely pace and jump over edges, scared, he'll slowly creep and back away when he comes to an edge, and angry, he'll stomp around at a fast pace and pounce over edges like he's trying to win an olympic event- and you have to use these emotions and a bunch of activatable tools to get Eets to his goal of a nice tasty cake on a rope.  While I was a fan of the original Eets Chowdown (in fact, one of the first DLC I ever got on the Xbox 360) I do admit it had some flaws, most glaring of which was the precision of the puzzles combined with how very easy and tempting it was to just go ""Give me the solution"", and cheat your way to victory. While Eets Munchies has the same ""Give me the solution"" option, I'll be honest- I don't feel as tempted to actually USE it: So far the precision of the items is not as pixel perfect as the original, and those times where you do put something in the wrong place don't feel as frustrating.Another great improvement is the music. Sound effects are replaced with a bunch of notes reminesent of the old Warner Bro's Coyote and Roadrunner cartoons, where Eets foot steps are punctuated by music depending on his mood.  Given that Eets is now no longer 3D rendered, and is now 2D animation, this also makes it tons easier to tell what his mood IS exactly (a feature that previously had to be conveyed in a little close-up image of Eets- especially if Eets starts off the level in the air.)Add to that a level editor, and I'd say Eets is now a much better game then it's first outing.

												A fun little puzzle game. I'm not sure in which bundle i got it, but I was looking for something to pass the time for a few hours, and Eets Munchies delivered. I especially like the fact that you can either try to simply go to the end goal or try to get all the treats before reaching the goal. That way, people who aren't too much into puzzle games (like myself) will not get stuck too long on a puzzle, while people looking for a challenge will try to get all the treats.			"

												I understand this game gets ""Very Positive"" reviews, but it is clearly not meant for me...  I'm afraid I found it ""meh"" at best.  After a few levels I was already wondering how soon this would end...  The game is clearly made for smartphones as it's a rehash of the simple ""get 3 items and reach the exit"" idea.  In fact, it's probably better on smartphones than on PC, as there's no full screen grfx, and when you do enlarge the window the grfx do look too big.While just completing a level is pretty easy, however if you are someone who must get every 'pie' before the exit then this game will be quite difficult in the later worlds.  Especially so on the challenge levels (aka Mystery Levels) which have no hints and are very different from the previous ""worlds"".  I was finally able to complete one of the Mystery Levels after first attempting 5 or so of them.While the game is fairly polished, it just isn't very exciting or new.  It is, however, thankfully short -- I was able to complete all the levels in 2.5 hrs (except the Mystery Levels).6 out of 10.			"

												I don't normally write reviews but when I encounter three serious design flaws in the first thirty seconds of gameplay, I have to say something.  The click-and-drag is so misaligned on the first object you touch that you will think it must have to do with the fact that you can't change the screen resolution.  So, you'll try to quit... try... there isn't a quit button. Seriously, it's as if the creators have never seen a PC game before and don't know what a patch is.  It's unfortuante because Eets: Munchies looks like it might be fun but c'mon, at least try to release a tested product.If you got the game in a bundle, farm the cards and pitch it on the scrap heap.

You place objects on the field, then press the ""Go"" button to send a thing to a place. The game boils down to trial-and-error, but the game's short enough that it doesn't become boring.

												Eets Munchies is a fun puzzle game i've gotten to try during the free weekend. It reminds me of the many types of puzzle games you find on mobile devises where you have to lead something to its objective with items placed in the world. in this case that you'd be the creature Eets to the cake in each level. There are a handful of placeable items I have seen so far, some that change the state of the world like bombs, some that change the state of Eets like buffs to jumping or removing the ability to jump entirely.  There are also items that you interact with in real time like cannons or whales that act as jump pads. Eets Munchies comes with a puzzle maker and has Steam workshop support so you can make puzzles to share with friends and strangers alike. Overall i've got to say that Eets is a stand up puzzle game, it may be small but I have not seen any negative quality's so far, its got neat art and a decent soundtrack that fits the style. I would recommend Eets munchies to fans of small puzzle games or mobile games. Eets is not that hard either, so it really could be fun for the family.			"

												Good for Kids or Tablets. Gets a bit ""harder"" later on. but overall not my game. pass :)The Pricing seems fair (~7€) but I would advocat for buying it on the -80% Sale. It just feels like a Tabletapp so much that its even refelected in the price I would pay for it if interested. The Puzzles of the first World were so easy i burned them in under 20min. Thought I would play it to 100% during the ""play for free"" event.... but then came World 2. It increased in difficutly, stayed fair and fun. Basic Mechanic is to find a way for Munchies to the final Cake. He can walk and run and eating things influences his behavior. But in World 2 I also noticed I didnt liked how items, shooting things/activating things, and munchies Pathfinding is handeld. Overall you have to make up a good plan at several stages by setting up the items. Then it gets to a hasted click Item 1 > 2 > 3 at sometimes very specific moments. For sure fun on Tablets but annoying af when doing it with a mouse. So its not a game for me cause of this buuuut...- The Character, Level and Itemdesign is very well done and Munchie is a likable little fella i wouldnt mind seeing in another game (jump&run for example).- The Mechanics are challenging with a fair learning curve- It has harder Challenges that can be unlocked (Wupwup, unlocks! :) )- The Music/Ambient of the game is fitting and over the short period i tested it, I didnt made me turn it down for my own tracklist. Thats a big thing for a Puzzlegame i think.Do I recommend this game? YES!I recommend it for: Children or Casual Gamers, hell even Streamers could enjoy solving the Puzzles onstream, while waiting for their main game to continue.			"

PROS:+ cute art style+ placement puzzles+ available puzzles by other playersCONS:- timing puzzles- no actual replayability- gets repetitive after a whileComment:A cute game with nice art style but gimmicky puzzles. This game is casual on some levels while merciless in others. The fact that it is clearly a mobile game for touchscreens is apparent from the UI as well as puzzles. I will not hold this fact against it though because it works well on PC, even going as far as integrating Steamworks. This grants the game a possibly endless array of user-created levels. Sadly one of the achievements is to create a level and publish it and so Steamworks is flooded with low-quality levels. I picked this up on a sale and you should too unless you are a big fan of these kind of games.			"

(All standard levels and most bonus)#56/60 levels complete# About 3 hoursEets Munchies a phone-esque puzzle game where you place items throughout a level, press go, and see if your character (who moves by himself) navigates and collects the level as you planned.Pretty fun game so far. Simple to finish a level. A bit more challanging to 100% a level. Like itPros:- Steam workshop			"

												A puzzle game where timing and ""pixel perfect"" game physics are an issue is not a good puzzle game. In projectile dependant puzzles, the margin of error for the correct way to solve it is way too precise. When it isn't projectiles, it's timing the events in an exact position at an exact time to make it work			"

Take one part 'Lemmings' mixed with one part 'Rube Goldberg' shake well and the end result will be 'Eets Munchies'.  This two dimensional puzzle platformer will challenge even the heartiest of players.That difficulty does come at a cost, occasionally the physics will perform slightly different between runs causing frustrating variance while optimizing a level solution.  The item placement would have benefited from grid layout to simplify complex alignment of objects.			"

												The trailer for Eets Munchies proclaims that it features ""pixel perfect physics,"" a feature that should leave you wary. Without a cyborg brain it is pretty much impossible to use pixel-perfect physics to your advantage, so instead you will suffer at its whims. Be prepared for projectiles and jumps to go awry based on pixel-perfect technicalities invisible to the human eye.This might seem a small complaint since the odds of getting stymied microscopically over and over are pretty small, but it plays into another of my complaints: knowing whether I'm on the right track. In developing a solution to one of the puzzles in Eets Munchies I might think, ""Oh, I will use this springboard to launch an item to that upper platform."" But the item bumps into something else. Well, maybe I need to position the item differently. Or maybe I need to time the launch a little better. Or maybe I'm totally on the wrong track, a fact I will discover after a dozen different permutations that reveal that yes, I am on the wrong track and yes, my implementation is physically impossible. I feel less like I am solving puzzles and more like I am bumbling around with the game's systems.All that aside, I think the sound design is polished. The game does fun little orchestral cues, e.g. a nervous warbling of strings when the creature teeters at the edge of a cliff. Think Looney Tunes. In fact, it would seem Looney Tunes is a large influence on the design in general, including the visuals, although I would say it's more ""new"" Looney Tunes in that regard, if that makes sense.

												Recommended if you liked the other Eets game.  Overall the puzzles and such do have variety and it's a worthy successor to the first game.  If you haven't played the first eets, I recommend getting the demo and playing it first, and if you like it, either buying the first and second game, the first one if you like the demo, and the second if you want some more variety and such in the game than what you found in the demo.  I hardly have any hours on it now that I've swapped accounts, but on my other account I have a sufficient amount for reviews.			"

												It's a puzzle game that almost feels like a map editor.

												The original Eets was a game with a new concept that narrowed it down to one character, allowing for a lot more room for puzzle solving, instead of Lemmings that would require more.In Eets Munchies,  the resolution is capped, and the system is similar to games like Angry Birds, the gameplay is still interesting, but very few improvements tbh over the first one.The presentation of Eets is nice but its exuction feel a little akward and disapointing, puzzles are either very easy to complete or very hard due to the many errors in timing, and that can feel frustrating after while. You can clearly see this in the mystery world (one of the 2 worlds added after the Beta), which is chock-full of those timing oriented puzzles, and its pain to complete bc of this issues.Overall, its a fun and cheap game, so based on that and if you liked the first one, i would recommended it.

												I had gotten it in a bundle some months ago, and finally got around to actually trying it out.  I thought it would be kind of cheesy, but it turned out to be a pretty fun little puzzle game.  Most of the puzzles were fairly simple, but there are a few that take a few minutes to get down due to some timing that is required. With the workshop there are bound to be more puzzles to get some extra play out of as well.  Overall, if you are looking for a neat little puzzle game, I say try it out, not sure abut the full price though, maybe wait for a discount.			"

												This game has a fairly immature title, and very cartoonish graphics, which is majorly misleading on how awesome, yet ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t this game is. Don't let the name fool you, at times, Eets Munchies can be insanely difficult. This game is definitely not for the weak minded and the non-strategically inclined. At times, the difficulty of it can destroy the level of fun, so for that, I give it a 3.5 out of 5. Is it a fun game? Sure. Is it worth your money? Maybe somewhere around $2 of it, but nothing more. So unless you get this game as a part of a bundle sale or a holiday sale, don't buy it. If you do happen to come across this game, it's worth playing, but the amount of playtime this requires is the equivalency of a 15 minute break on a 6 hour shift, or a snickers bar after a 7 day famine. Enough to keep you on your toes, but highly dis-satisfying. All in all, I'm undecided on this title. It's a definite ""try-before-you-buy"".			"

												It's a puzzle game, much in line with other *free* mobile puzzle games, where you get Bunny-thing from point A to point B while getting as many lolipops/jellies (a.k.a. stars in other games) as possible.  Levels range from laughably easy to table-flippingly hard, but in the end, it's just the same ol' thing, just with a bunny reskin.  It's not even that high quality as far as PC puzzle games go.I enjoyed it for about the first 15 minutes before getting bored.  I somehow managed to clock enough time to get the steam trading cards, but I doubt I will touch this game again.Honestly, I cannot imagine why anyone would pay $$$ for this game when free alternatives exist to sate one's appetite for puzzle games.  I only have it because it was included in a humble bundle.If this game goes on a ridiculous sale (like, maybe 90%?) it might be worth picking up if you like creating your own levels and putting them on the workshop.  Otherwise, pass.			"

												A cute, quick puzzle game that you can easily go through in an evening. Puzzle difficulty scales at a reasonable level and the hint system doesn't spell out the answer but rather gives you a single step to solving the puzzle. Adorable music that syncs with the character animations makes this definitely worth a play through.			"

Its essentially a puzzle game with this weird little thing, and you need to position certain items so he can eat all the stars and get to the end. simple in concept, but sometimes pretty hard.

												Simple yet entertaining. It's basically a casual puzzle game for PCs, but with Steam Workshop support. Klei entertainment did a really good job integrating level creator in the game, creating huge potentials for user-made levels. The game itself is not too easy nor hard and is generally very enjoyable to play.My Score: 8/10 (The game itself is 7/10 but the potential for user-made levels gives it a bump)			"

												Basically like a typical online puzzle game, albeit one of the better ones. In other words, it passes the time. Place objects on the screen so Eets (the urr, rabbit-type thing) can get all the sweet food on-screen.Challenging puzzles for the hardcore people, though the more casual player can make things easier by deciding not to collect all sweet food, and a hint option exists to point the player in the right direction.In terms of sound and vision, this game is well polished and gives off a real atmosphere. Feels like a Looney Tunes sketch...Plenty of levels to play through, though the game is relatively short - again, like an online game. Took only a few days to complete. Beyond that, the puzzle maker offers limitless possibilities - if you're into making puzzles, that is.			"

												Surprisingly, a pretty good puzzle game! Its simple, and yet both challenging. You're a cute hungry creature, and you're goal is to cleverly clear each level by obtaining all treats whilst creating path to each levels cake.It has a very friendly interface, with easy controls so that anyone can pick up and play. However, although it may be easy for most to play, the real challenge is in collecting the treats. Eets Munchies will have most people stop, think, and plan their next move in order to collect all treats, and each level provides the player with a different experience, keeping the game fresh.Also, the integration of the steam workshop into this game is a great addition. You can create & share your own levels, and try other peoples creations. This feature definitely  boosts the replay value of the game after completing it 100% In the end, I'd say its a good buy for people that are into puzzle games. It has plenty of entertaining and challenging puzzles to twist your mind with, and the steam workshop integration is definitely another reason to buy this game. All in all, its a nice pickup if you're looking for something to kill time with and challenge you.4/5			"

												A simple puzzle game that pays homage to classics like The Incredible Machine; but when stacked up against such games in the genre, Eets Munchies really falls short in terms of complexity and replayability.Most of the puzzles are rather straightforward and easily beaten, with a tiny handful of levels presenting any real challenge to puzzle game enthusiasts. This detriment contributes to the overall scant length of the game, but that's easily remedied if you are willing to dive into the abundant trove of user generated content available on the steam workshop.Despite the flaws though, the game does flourish a very attractive art style with equally appealing character animations. And the included level editor is easy to pick up and use.			"

Basically we help the creature called Eets to collect all items (called 'treats') and a delicious-looking cake.Replay value is quite low from the base game, but there are lots of custom puzzle made by other player, and we can also create our own puzzle.

												Rating:A beautiful little puzzle game for casual gaming.8 / 10Gameplay:You place various items in a 2D jump'n'run like stage to solve a ""puzzle"". The puzzle is basically to get the main character to the final cake, ideally collecting the 3 bonus items. Some of the items will change the mood of the character, and in different moods the character will react in different ways, for example if the character eats a pepper he will get angry and walk faster and jump farther. Another item can make him timid, then he will not jump across gaps and instead turn around.Graphics:Cuddly graphics look (cel-shading-ish), it suits the gameplay style, in my opinion it looks pretty adorable, should not be taxing for the PC.Difficulty:I don't think the game is that difficult, in fact the only reason why I would not give it a 10/10 is the 'too easy' part and there are not that many levels to keep you occupied a long time.Overall:It is a nice cute cuddly puzzling game that you can play in between for short rounds, the levels are relatively easy in my opinion so it may be more suited for younger ages than adults, only thing left to wish for me was more levels.

												I tried this out during the free period. It's definitely a fun puzzle game, and I can see people who like these types of games, really enjoying this one. In this game you have to help set up/manipulate the course the little guy is going to walk so he eats all the dandy and the cake in the end. It's funny and cute and the further you get in the more complex the levels and the more different types of items you can use, which all have their own unique feature. Despite that I am not really the type for these kind of games, even I enjoyed what I did play from it so far, so if you are a fan of puzzle games then I highly recommend this game.			"

												Pretty fun little game that is surprisingly satisfying when solving the later puzzles. My 3 year old loves messing around with it also.			"

												By far one of the best items I got during the Winter Sale this year. The soothing gameplay plus the puzzle solving in quite enjoyable. While not much in the way of difficulty I can safely say you won't be pulling your hair out with this one. It should be able to run good on most systems too. I'm only 11 mins in and I know I'll be enjoying this one for a while. The music is very much a long loop but by no means annoying. Get this one on sale -- you won't be dissapointed.			"

												Eets munchies is a mini puzzle game where you use items at your disposal in order to lead our little eet to the cake , while earning bonus points for getting treats on the way.Every few levels you get to use a new item, cart bomb, fan,eating whale, etc.There's 48 levels in total without counting the mistery levels relatively short game but fun for a few hours of casual fun.But the base price 7 dollars is a bit too much for a game you can beat in 1-2 hours depending how good you are at puzzles, this game gets usually bundled so you might be able to get it for a better price during those.

												fun small puzzel game like contraption make the game has some neat features and a working steam workshop that is ok. the gameplay is good and all the items are explained and the levels have a hint button which tells you where to put one of your items. Overall a very good little puzzel game.			"

												Decent puzzle game but none of the game's maps are something I would say are challenging. (Still great for beginners or children.) There were only a couple of the mystery puzzles that had me stumped for a while, everything else was done so quickly I didn't play for very long before having the entire game completed.On the up side, you can make your own puzzles (If you're into that.) and upload them to the Steam Workshop to share them with others. I didn't really spend a lot of time looking at the Workshop puzzles from other players but someone may have put the time in to make some decently challenging puzzles.			"

												I was in disbelief when I read so many bad criticism to this game, so I gave it a try. I now understand it. This game is completely unpolished. The devs thought it would be a good idea to put the item input BELOW the item so that new players spend 10 minutes figuring out how to grab a ♥♥♥♥ing piece of wood instead of thinking where to put it. The mechanics are wrong, and the puzzles are more volatile than a pregnant woman's hormones. I can't even set the resolution because the game has no options for that.In conclusion, don't even.			"

												An adorable puzzle game with very cartoonish atmosphere.Every move and action is followed by specific sound effects and character mood changes, just like in a cartoon. The puzzles provide you with items, needed to ""finish"" the path in the most efficient way (by collecting all treats). A simple and positive game with relaxing atmosphere. Great when you need to spend some time, probably good to keep a kid busy too.			"
