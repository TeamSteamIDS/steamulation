												A 20-minute look into the bleak future of United States space exploration if we continue cutting NASA's budget and failing to educate our citizens in math and science compared to other countries. It's a little-known fact that, during the development of Starlite: Astronaut Rescue, highly intelligent individuals who once helped put man on the moon were forced to simulate having no scientific education. The result is a game with physics that are all wrong and only 20 minutes of plodding, unrealistic content—all they could manage to create under these conditions before giving up. A real eye-opener, and a future none of us want to live in.			"

												It looks good in the video and the notes seem intriguing, but for a a game that you play once, this should be free.  It's an interesting educational tool that should be flushed out much more fully.  The really is one task - determine the wavelength of a radio signal.  The description makes it sound like there are more of these types of puzzles, but there aren't.Even the surrounding terrain, which is supposed to be from Curiosity, is very low-res and could easily be improved upon.All told, this looks like a 3D game kit's demo rather than a true game - even educational.

												So the positive - It looks kind of ok...ish? Otherwise MEH. One scientific equation, which isn't difficult and the rest is point and click. Your companion astronaut is also very annoying - luckily this is such a short game that you don't have to listen to him for long.  I don't really know what I was expecting for just over a pound, but this really isn't great. Avoid!			"

												Did you ever dream of going into space.... becoming an Astronaut and being one of the first people to stop foot on mars?  When you were younger did you put on a tin foil helmet, tie a sheet around your neck, and climb piles of dirty clothes pretending you were walking on Mars...  If so you were probably super stoked for this game...   I never did these things though .....  (shifting my eyes from side to side to hide the fact I'm not being honest)...  I figured for less than a dollar I'd grab this game, try it out for the 20 or so minutes that people claimed I'd get from it, pat myself on the back for taking a trip to the red planet and feel joy.Unfortunately that didn't happen, this game glitches like crazy..... the first glitch was the work bench, it wouldn't let me combine the items....  After trying about 1000 different directions I decided to check on line to see what I was doing wrong.... I did nothing wrong the game just didn't want to register that I was crafting....So I finally get past this glitch and nearly immediately afterward I'm hit with a puzzle.... awesome...  I solved the puzzle using the calculator.....  sigh... again the game glitches up.It's not the worst thing in the world, but gets kind of annoying that you need to continually restart from the beginning after every glitch..   I can't recommend this game at all, even for .89 cent.  It's far too short and bug ridden to be worth a purchase at all.  Save your money for something else.  The only saving grace is the fact that buying the game will allow you to get it's 1 achievement fairly easily...  Is that enough to purchase the game.... well ask yourself if the extention of your e-peen is worth whatever price the game is selling for...  I don't personally think it is.			"

												Starlite: Astronaut Rescue is a 2002 tech demo for... oh wait. Nevermind. It's a ""mini-adventure"", sporting ""Unity Terrain Mars Environment and Shadows, Futuristic advanced rover setting, advanced biosuit space suits, professional voice acting, realistic physics, original story and dialogue; and advanced robotic navigation"". Every single one of the aforementioned features are over-exaggerated. This cough game cough is what you'd expect from one of those 100 Games on 1 Disc compilations for Windows 95. It's truly awful, but luckily it lasts only 15 minutes.My single positive for this title is that I encountered zero bugs/issues with my short experience. But, bugs/glitches are directly proportional to content, and so this is expected.In your short experience you'll control a rover and a human character. The looking action is awful, and movement is just as bad thanks to really terrible mouse acceleration. It feels as if the player is on ice. This problem is disguised as 'realistic physics'. It's annoying, plain and simple. Jumping and staying in the air for 2 seconds longer, and walking with longer strides is realistic physics. Not releasing the W key and waiting 2 more seconds for your character to come to a halt. Eugh.The story is a generic rescue mission, which is outlined in the title of the game. Going along as usual, someone had an accident, you have to find them by completing abstract tasks and finally you're rewarded by landing back at square one. There are a grand total of three 6th grade maths problems that need to be solved, a 30 seconds crafting bit (with a cluttered interface) and then a short driving and positioning part with a rover. Oh and someone said some words at one point.Avoid.			"

												This game is about 20 minutes and length and at the current time, it costs under $2.00. However, it was a long and painful 20 minutes, with graphical and interface glitches and unexplained slowdown. The graphics are horrendous and looked like something from 10 or 15 years ago. There really isn't much of a game here. You move from point A to point B several times, and have to solve a few math problems. Except with the poor calculator functionality, I opened up the Windows calculator instead. A waste of time, even if you're really into NASA and space exploration.			"

												Starlite: Astronaut Rescue Review from Episode 149 of Steam ShotsStarlite: Astronaut Rescue is sort of an educational title. It was made with the support of NASA and the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, along with a few other supporters. The title is also really short, like 20 minutes short. It feels like a tablet game in the interactive section of a museum. Moving the camera was difficult, and felt more like I should be dragging my finger around, not pointing a mouse. It doesn’t help the cursor wouldn’t stay in my main monitor either, so I couldn’t get it back in the middle to click on things. The gameplay involves doing basic tasks, like go here, click on this and then it explains stuff to you in a really neat way. It also had you do a math problem that I just couldn’t figure out. Thank god I review games, not build rockets. This short title is a neat thing, and it’s still in early access, with a promised multiplayer mode coming out soon along with some more content once they get it all worked out. Hopefully it isn’t like the Mars Mission and set for a timely 2025 release.

												It's a decent mini-adventure game. Unlike some other ""unsatisfied people"", It is  quite enjoyable. Although, the only thing that really was out of place, was the ""action-adventure music"". (It wasn't bad, but it felt like it didn't belong there.)The voice acting is quite nice and graphics are ""ok"". Not really up-to-date graphics, but for what the ""game"" was meant to be, it is acceptable.  The game doesn't really tell much information about why you are there and doesn't really let you explore things, unfortunately.  ""the story"" is over before you know it. So your question is, is it worth the money/time? For someone who is looking for a game, I don't think this is your thing. If you are looking for something short and unique? Then sure, why not? It's not like it's a lot of money.I rate this ""mini-adventure"" a 6.5/10			"

												The Linux port is a complete farce - mouselook has been bugged since launch, and when the devs made it sort of work (by having the user click and drag their view around the screen, of all things) it turned out to be impossible to use the crafting bench anyway, rendering the game uncompletable.For £2, it's usually hard to go wrong - but this game certainly provides a way to do so.

												It's a 20 minute game.  If you can get past that, keep reading.Astronaut Rescue is a very short adventure.  There are places you could go a little off the beaten path, but it's not open world, it's not sandbox, and...well, it's Mars.  There isn't that much to see and do besides the adventure, which is linear in nature and your hand is held through much of it.All that said, it's a fun little game and well worth the $1.79 sale price.  The story's plot is interesting and tightly scripted, the voice action is excellent, and while you don't get to drive the Minerva (picture 5, above), you do get to drive around the Sams (picture 3) in low gravity.  You even (potentially) learn a little bit along the way.Well worth $1.79.  The $2.99 full price might be pushing it a little due to game length, but not due to quality.			"

It's with the quid I paid and it does clearly state that the game is only 20 minutes on the store page: So don't complain. It needs harder maths and physics puzzles and it could do with a change of game engine to: Unreal Engine 3 maybe. The physics of the world - Mars- are fine, a little off putting to start with but fine. Also, it's perfect for those that want a easy 100% achievement game... Overall, it's a fine little game.			"

Game mechanics were very fluid although I did have one problem with the mouse cursor popping up from time to time when I didn't really want it to. Biggest downfall of the game is that it's a very short game (12 minutes if you speed run it--20 if you take your time).

			Just a quick run through of Starlite - Astronaut Rescue mission. It was a nice little game, was pretty cheap on steam 40% off had it under 2 bucks and I thought what the hell.		

.I've not played it since that recording mostly because I hadn't seen any updates to it and even now going through and looking it seems like the game got canned because there are poeple who will write  negative review about something if you don't end up getting to kill things because its 'not a game' in those cases.I for one enjoyed the game when it came out, and though math isn't my strongest skill didn't find it all that difficult to figure out the formula it gave you, I mean the calculator was right there and all it was was a division problem, not like we were trying to calculate the anti-sine cosine of a quadratic rectangular polygon or something.  It felt like the game was ment for educational purposes and maybe be used in the class-room as a 'fun' way to teach kids maths and science.  I could see that being the case if they added a few more scenarios/missions around that theme.			"

												This is the worst, most painful game I have had the displeasure to endure in a long time.It's not really a game. It's just a slow, linear, boring mess of ""walk to target"".The most entertaining part of the game is operating a calculator, to divide the number 3 by some things. I'm serious. Literally every other task in this game is ""walk to the glowing spot on the ground"". The dialog is painful, and the voice acting multiplies that pain exponentially. On top of that, it's got a lot of small bugs, lots of irritating interface bugs. This all adds up to make the experience as disappointing as I can imagine.Here's a list of some things that are more fun:- shopping for car insurance- waiting in a dentist's office- sitting in a puddle on a cold day- that thing with the baby and the fire in The Stanley Parable, all 4 hours of it- making 20 boxes of minute rice- walking back and forth in a small roomNasa, Whitecard, I am disappoint.

It isn't terrible per se, but it can do with a LOT of improvement.For starters, the player moves around like a steady-cam; Everything is smoothed out, from the movement over hills down to the motion of the mouse. It feels unnatural to the point it seems you're playing a drone of sorts.Then there is the geometery; Terrain smoothing has been around for about a decade now, and it could have been used to some extent and look better than it does right now. Even with graphics set to the max I can see the edges a mile away. It is sloppy and it shouldn't have to be that way. And this doesn't go for just the terrain. The objects, entities and vehicles themselves look bad because of this. It is impossible to make a curved geometery that works on all hardware, but there are shaders and filters and all sorts of tricks that are very effective on that front.Texture quality; Well, there is some, just not a whole lot. This is again one of those points that would have been acceptable a decade ago. With an option 'Beautiful' I expect to see high resolution textures.This would all be acceptable in a simulator, which I suppose this falls under, if the actual simulation demanded high detail or amount of calculations that would justify sacrificing graphical fidelity. And that is probably what upsets me the most; It looks and feels quickly assembled in a Unity editor with little to no attention to detail or features.It looks and feels like a demo, which, at the time I bought it (a few years ago) was a bit more expensive than the 5 bucks (if not less) that's advertised these days.It does a good job as an educational tool, however, for both children who want to be astronauts and game developers alike (the latter probably isn't a complement though). It has some nice lessons in frequencies and stuff, but that's about the only thing it has going for it. Wel...it has the NASA logo up front, and it pained me to see the Gates Foundation in there as well, especially since it has the tendancy to crash when ALT+TABbing, but that may just be me.All in all I cannot recommend this for what it is. I love the idea, but there is no game here. What little simulation it has is completely on rails and there is no way to mess up or discover something that deviates from the main story, which plot also escapes me...I hope some developers got a lot of experience out of this, and I'm not sure about it's current price, but if you see this for anything over 50 cents, just leave it be.One final sidenote, this is an alpha test for Starlite: Astronaut Academy, to be released in 2014. That was a year ago. It has been sold (and still is) as seperate full-release title (There is no Steam Early Access disclaimer on the store page). These 2 things don't bother me as much as the fact that over the years there have been no updates, improvements or anything that indicates this being a work in progress or part of a bigger project which is still in progress (although I'm pretty sure that one's dead as well).

												Bought it for a laugh, took me around 20 minutes to do. It is an educational game in a sense. I don't know why but it was slightly enjoyable 20 minute experinece, it's a diffrent type of gameplay experience from the games that come out these days. In saying that I am not sure if it is worth buying, it does fell diffrent to most games that have come out recently but is that a good thing? Sometimes trying a diffrent approach to others can end up being bad in the end. You must also remember this is not NASA's first attempt at trying to create an educational game. Their first project Moonbase Alpha was a free to play game and I'm guessing it was a test to see the appeal of Space Simulation games. Due to the amount of downloads I assume their went ahead with the Starlite game. What they have to remeber is Moonbase Alpha was free, Starlight is a paid game and they should have considered that. Although Starlite does try diffrent things to moonbase. Even thought it is short every task is diffrent to the last and that's nice considering how repetetive Moonbase Alpha was, so atleast they tried to change up the gameplay this time. I'm on the fence about this, but I am going to reccomend it, as long as you know what you are paying for here.			"

												Here's all you need to know: it takes longer to download this game than it does to finish it. I heard that Starlite was an MMO spiritual successor to Moonbase Alpha, and I have been looking forward to it for that reason. However, this is not that game. There is no depth, the crafting and problem solving in the description refer to dragging a wire onto a radio twice and to dividing two numbers together using an in game calculator, and the fact that the developers chose to call this an 'RPG' or 'Simulation' is flabbergasting. The 'game' is too short and simple to be interesting, and the controls are too awkward to be fun.If this release was meant to get people excited about the eventual release of a real Starlite game, then it has failed miserably. Despite the fact that my time is far more valuable to me than the price of this 'game', I'm considering trying to get my money back simply to make a point. The developers should be ashamed for releasing something so insubstantial and pretending that it's worth our time or money.			"

												Recommend with conditions.  Realize this is a short demo which will get you on the list for the hopefully much better MMO beta when it comes out.  It's obviously geared toward younger kids, which seems typical of NASA public outreach stuff, as if adults have no interest in space exploration.   People have complained about the mushy controls, but it states that it's supposed to be a realistic Mars gravity simulation, so the awkwardness is probably just what you'd encounter with the real thing.   Think they had an easy time fixing the Hubble Space Telescope in orbit?   For a buck and change don't expect Half-Life 3.  You will however learn how to triangulate someone's position with radio waves, and if you finish it you even get a badge.			"

												Nice couple of 3d vehicles and even a decent Mars landscape. That unfortunately is the end of the positives. This is a horribly produced educational game disguised as an adventure whose sole purpose seems to be getting you to solve 3 rather simplistic division exercises. Its meant to teach the basics of triangulation as well I suppose but the interface is so horrible that getting anything to work is more luck than judgement so I would be suprised if many happy teens take that lesson home from playschool.The interface may work on a tablet or other touchscreen device I cant comment as I played the Linux version. On my version you can turn about 20 degrees left or right before your mouse pointer comes to the edge of the window and you stop turning. This leaves you walking backwards to most places as you cant turn around.In summary nice graphics shame about the game.			"

												How well you do with this one is going to be highly dependant on how close you are to the target audience. The game itself is very simple, a short series of 'click/tap to complete' actions with very basic animation and a single set of three division problems using scientific notation being the sole puzzle. Sat here as an adult it reminded me of the kind of touch screen display sections I remember seeing in the childrens galleries at science museums and was a twenty minute curiosity at best.If you've a child of the right age with a bit of a 'wow!' about space then this might be a suitable quick distraction (though I think they'd get on better with the ipad version). If you're an adult who wants to play with rovers on Mars, I'd reccomend 'Take On Mars' from the early access section.And if you're looking for more fun with text to speech? Wait for the future online release as there is nothing here to sate your JOHN MADDEN JOHN MADDEN AEIOU related needs :).			"

Yes, its slow, the controlls are awkward, the score is out of place, and the graphic quality is poor, but, if you can look past one or two of these flaws, Starlite has a concept worth digging for.

												First impressions: http://www.cublikefoot.com/starlite-astronaut-rescue-first-impressions/Well, the game took me about 20 minutes to beat, but it was advertised like that in the first place, so that's justified. Starlite: Astronaut Rescue serves as a sneak peek for its upcoming MMO counterpart, Starlite: Astronaut Academy, which releases this summer.The game has one goal, with that goal being to rescue a stranded astronaut. You must use the power of math and science in order to accomplish this relatively simple task. It doesn't take long to do, and the work involved is not that difficult either, just some fairly simple algebra and walking. Oh, and when the game is completed, you get a shiny achievement to show how cool you are. This is the only achievement in the game, so it's an easy ""100%"" game.The game is currently priced at $3, which is a bit high for what you get. Maybe if it was $1? Ehh, 50 cents would work better actually.			"

												Woah, well, that was short! Looking over a few of the reviews, there's not a lot I can contribute to this.  I was expecting something like TakeOnMars, but what this is, seems to be a short demonstrator for, a generic 'mission'-based physics/maths tutorial for kids, themed around planetary exploration.You're cast in the role of  ""The Commander"" of a two-man crew (but the other dude vanishes halfway through), and have to rescue an astronaut who's crashed on the other side of the hill by figuring out how to get there using some trigonometry... Except Trig's probably a bit too tricky, so all the game has you do is a few divisions on a calculator, and the game pretends to do the trig for you...I can see where they were going with it, and I hope they can clean this up and add some more missions, but I have to say, I can't really recommend it to anyone:The play length is ~5 minutes, if that.  All the assets are there: Models, texture maps, voices, a GUI, etc... But it's all rough and unfinished, and given where the pilot 'crashes', I felt I could probably just walk there, rather than go through all the rigmarole of triangulating positions.No, I can't, in my heart, recommend this to anyone, I'm sorry.  If you want to play astronaut, play Space Engineers, or TakeOnMars.   This looks like a late-90s attempt at a 3d demo / maths tutorial.     If it was far more polished, and had a couple of missions, then perhaps I'd give it a thumbs-up, but nobody should really pay money for this, sorry :(			"

Hey NASA, stop wasting my tax dollars on shoddy video games, maybe think about getting back to ACTUALLY putting men on Mars!Forget it, NASA is hopeless. I'm betting on companies like SpaceX getting us there first. Bill & Melinda Gates: With all of your millions, this is the best you could do? This is a sad pathetic effort, and a horrible waste of whatever you spent on it.A little more detail: the player locomotion is laughably bad, you can see in the first seconds of the game that the character slides over the terrain in a totally unnatural way. The ""formula page"" was completely impossible to get past, even though I am a PHYSICIST and I completely understand the equation involved. I literally couldn't figure out how to work the clunky UI. I then alt-tabbed to go look for help, and found I couldn't get back into the game! So I force-closed it, then went straight to write this review.To Gaming Community/Devs: Somebody should make a game along these lines, that is actually GOOD! Because I still like the idea behind it, and would love to play a properly implemented game like this. Maybe see if Elon Musk will fund it?			"

												Wow. WOW. To put it simple: I could have gotten three beers for the same price as this game, and it would have been WAY more fun. Even ONE beer would have been more fun.The Controls are dodgy, the story is edgy.The graphics are, say, 2007, and the oh-so-realistic mars gravity allows me to moonwalk better than the King of Pop himself. Maybe I should trademark it as marswalk.The space between those giant MNRV-wheels contains invisible walls.You can't skip cutscenes, neither can you click ""next page"" (or whatever, I won't start the game again to look up the original term) during text briefings for a certain time (until you totally understood what they told you!).""Constructing a habitat"" means ""take some box out of a drawer and put it to some pre-assigned target position"".""Craft tools"" means ""combine two out of two possible items"".""Flag down the medevac"" means ""stand near the MNRV and wait for the ship to land at the other end rather than near the position where you 'flag it down'"".Let's don't talk about the physics again. Best moment in the whole game is when you drive that small rover out of the MNRV (whatever that means, btw) and jump over the ledge, disregarding the oh-so-realistic gravity.Honestly: worst. game. ever. I don't quite understand why NASA banks its name for this mere alpha demo version of a game.Get yourself some Bud lights, and even they'd have more percentage than I'd rate this game./edit: one last addition: it took me longer to write this review than to actually play the game.

Graphically it's sub-par, flat textures, stiff and/or missing animations, very low-poly models; this may make the game run better on a wider variety of hardware, but it makes it look rough, even for an indie game. The controls are floaty and slow, though that may be by design given the lighter gravity of Mars. The gameplay consists mostly of ""walk here and press E/LMB"", so it's not the most intense or involved game, and although you're on a resuce mission to save a pilot running out of oxygen... there is never a real sense of urgency.Still, all that said, it's somehow charming. And it's cool to see a non-violent, science-based video game, even if it's just a rough-edged 20 minute sampler of what the developers have planned. If it were more expensive, I might judge it more harshley, but for the price, I think it's still worth it even given all the issues mentioned above. If nothing else, to see where the developers take it.But be warned, if you don't like unpolished games, you should probably stay away.			"

												This is probably the worst game I have played on steam.  First, the controls are terrible.  When the game starts, turn to your right.  You will be stuck looking in this direction for the next 5 minutes or so until you complete the first part of the game.  You see, when you move the mouse to the right in a normal game to turn, you turn to the right continuously.  This is a special game, in which turning the mouse to the left stops when the mouse hits the ride side of the screen.  This means that you can only turn slightly to the left or right, and not at all behind you.  Think about it, this game was made with NASA's help, when through development and testing, and nobody thought it strange that you couldn't turn around.  Even if you could turn around this game would go from a -1 / 10 to a 1/10.  The game has you move to about 3 different areas and press a button.  You then solve some math problems, and move to about 2 more areas, and the game is over.  This brings me to the highlight of the game, this pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥is only about 20 minutes long.  In short this game is terrible and would make even the most NASA scientists vote to defund NASA if they were given the chance to play.			"

Unresponsive interface, orphaned mouse cursors, crap alt-tab behavior, goals consist entirely of going to a marked location a few meters away except for the three math questions which are just simple division problems. The only good point is that it's about 20 minutes of play time, so it is mercifully short.			"

												This interactive game is a creative image of what NASA thinks it might potentially look like when we have people on Mars. The gameplay is a little wonky and doesn't handle the movement+camera positioning very well. There is only really one objective and a math solution to solve in the entire game. The ingame calculator takes a moment to get used to it. But if you are a fan of achievements or care about NASA it might be worth the twenty minutes for the extremely cheap price. That is if the proceeds are giving to NASA in some way.			"

												I'll start with the obvious since it's clear most don't read before they buy a game. It is 20 minutes in length, but it's also cheap and gives you access to the beta. Which for most beta accesses this is a steal. The game gives a good taste of what the final version will be like, but it's still clear that it's not in beta yet. The missions needed to complete the game were a little simplistic; however, on th whole it was still fun and for a short moment you feel like you're on Mars. Only hickup I had while playing full screen was the mouse look didn't always behave as expected. Annoying, yes, dealbreaker for something this early, no.			"

												It's a short game, and has some issues with the mouse control (which is well documented in the forums), but overall it's a good start  for an oncoming MMORPG.  It's a preview for a potentially great game.  I recommend waiting for a sale if you don't want to spend $3 for a 20-30 minute game.Actually, some images look rather familiar, from those days when I worked in room 183 and passed White Card all the time.  I'm in room 301 now, so I don't go by that room often, but it's pretty cool that I work in the same building as the Project White Card team.  I should get autographs on a printed image of my badge before you all move out. :DKeep up the good work, I look forward to a full-length, and hopefully you get the mouse control fixed.  Hopefully you'll bring out an Android version as well.			"

												I've noticed most reviews of this game are not exactly favorable, and granted, while the game itself is a little pricey for it's actual content, it's not that bad.The animations could certainly use some work... a lot of work, it's almost obviously a kid's game, and while that's not a bad thing, I would like to see a bit more realism, with the ""rovers"" in particular. The audio (conversation, spacecraft sounds) and strange controls need to be erased and completely reworked from the ground up. The calculator needs clarification on it's operation it took me 10 minutes to figure out I needed to use the num pad to punch in the answers (it was a late night).With a little work the game could really be turned into something quite attractive visualy, with new textures, an extended sight range, and some kind of post fx, I wouldn't complain. It's still in alpha I believe, at least that's the impression I got from visiting their Vanilla site, so there is the chance that the whole thing could really be fine-tuned. Not only that, but this game seems to be a ""demo"" (of sorts) for an upcoming NASAMMO? Never thought I would type something like that. But yes, I would certainly recommend this, probably not for someone in my age-range (18-21), but for younger kids looking to learn a bit about real space travel, this could be just what they need.

The game constis basically consits of moving from place to place and doing three division problem (no variables involved, just grade school ariuthmetic), and clicking on whatever.  No narrative, no art, awkward controls, lousy voice acting, bad script.  There is nothing good about this game.  Even worse than G-Ball.  Not even so-bad-it's-good.  Just ... failure.I gather that there are runours to the effect that this will become something more, or that what we've really bought here is a ticket to betaland or something, but really, between this and G-Ball, there's nothing here to indicate the discipline or competence or vision to produce anything worth waiting for.
