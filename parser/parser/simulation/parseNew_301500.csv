Early Access Review
								Have you, or anyone you knowA) Played Crimson Skies?B) Wanted to live vicariously through an alcoholic frenchman?C) Experienced terrible customer service that left you foaming at the mouth and require someone to restore your faith in humanity?If you answered yes to any of those question this game might be right for you!BOMB allows you to live out your Porco Rosso fantasies such as verbally abusing your companions and engaging in nail biting aerial combat. This game is FUN. Although it might not be a 100% accurate sim experience it is a nice break from the stress of DCS World/IL2 mechanics,  and does not require an expensive Track IR and joystick setup (although joystick is recommended because mouse controls are a bit wonky right now).There are 3 views, pretty classic, 3rd person, cockpit (my personal favorite) and 1stperson no cockpit (why people fly like this i have no idea) Cockpit features lots of gauges and doohickys, all of which seem to function. Cockpits are also unique for each flyable plane, which seems obvious but is lacking in some other flight games.It features believable planes that are a cool mix of prop and jet/rocket fighters. You can usually guess which realworld aircraft inspired them by how they handle. Weapons usually consist of your stock machine guns and your choice of cannons/flak guns and other options.The game features multiplayer but i have not yet tried it, I think ill stick with the story for now.One last note, the support is awesome. Email with an issue and you can expect a quick reply and fix within days. They're helpful and courteous, and even though my specific issue has yet to be solved they told be to expect a fix in the next patch. Worth a buy for this alone.My only negatives are that mouse control and optimization could use some work (both are being worked on by the development team)And that I would like to see more planes added (but to be honest, my ideal flight game features hundreds of unique planes, so take that with a grain of salt)Happy Flying!

												Oh boy, where to begin....If you want the short version - the game is just not fun.If you want the long version - read on!So to start with, here are the pros of the game:+ Interesting premise+ The characters seem funny enough at times+ It's nice to see the devs attempt to emulate Crimson Skies type games.And here are the cons:- No tutorial what's so ever, the game is not hard to figure out, but it would have been nice if they included one.- The mission pacing is awful, the first 3-4 missions last for about two minutes and just make you fly forward requiring minimal input from your end. They could have made them in to a single mission and it would have benefited the game.- The flight model is arcade, but not the fun type of arcade like Ace Combat. The gravity doesn't seem to affect your plane, it flies the same no matter which direction you chose, be that up or down and the rudders rubberband like crazy. It will swing you back to the direction you came from the moment you release the turn button. I would also like to point out that it feels like you are flying though molasses instead of air.- The environments look extremely bland and the trees flicker like crazy when you fly over them, the planes look nice, but everything else looks like an late Xbox / early360 game.- The performance is spotty at best, I was getting frame drops from 80 to 20 while nothing was happening on the screen and it doesn't look like a game that should ever drop below 60 on a 290X even on the highest settings.- The menus look like they are placeholder, especially the options screen and the mission failure one. - And the main con of all that just made me quit for good? It just wasn't fun. I love flight game like the Crimson Sky, Ace Combat, Blazing Angels, Sky Crawlers, etc, and this is a disgrace compared to all of them.I do not recommend this game unless you find it on sale.			"

								As of Mk IIIb:Like arcadey flight sims? Have a gamepad or joystick/hotas? Loved Crimson Skies?Than most likely you're gonna like BOMB.Nice graphics, amusing storyline, cool art- and overall game- style, pretty good AI.Controls are not as tight as they were in crimson skies though, that needs some work.Plus, only one difficulty level for campaign (and not the easiest one) is quite tough (at least for someone like me who sucks using joysticks xD).Other than that - pretty damn good flight combat sim!More details in the video:

								A really cool game !I missed the feeling of a good flight fight for a long time.For people liking airplanes games i think its a must have.The game is really nice with his own style, a special mention to the sea wich is beautiful.The solo campaign is quite good (i laughed a few times on some jokes) and the multi really upgrade the potential of the game. Even the ""escarmouche"" mode with AI (wich is pretty good) is interesting and challenging !With the promise opening of modding i can't see why this game wouldn't be a sucess especially if people start making new content (more planes, more weapons, more everything).That's it, i'll go see ""Marcel"" for new adventures !

								This review is based on about 1 hour of playing through 5-6 missions, and I was blown away. I forced myself to stop playing just to post this.If you liked Crimson Skies or Wings of War, this game is right up your alley. I'm a life-long flight sim player who enjoys both simulations and arcade flight games, and this game has the special sauce. - Fun, varied missions.- Pretty, retro graphics in a beautiful tropical environment- Accessible yet realistic-ish flight model (as far as arcade flying goes)- Fantastic controls, especially with an XBox 360 controller (haven't gotten it to work with my joystick yet)- Laugh-out-loud funny dialogue and story.- Great artwork and aircraft design			"

												Oh my...  This game is excellent.  It's not easy at all, even though it doesn't model planes realistically.  Any comparisons made to Crimson Skies are pretty accurate.  I'd say the flight model is similar to War Thunder on ""arcade"" but the planes are considerably less maneuverable.  Considering you're flying a twin engine cargo plane, that's expected.  The dialogue that strings the missions together is funny, brief, and to the point.  ""Go blow up the thing.""  There are bombs, rockets, torpedoes, and a variety of cannons that get strapped on the planes.  Thankfully the missions do have checkpoints, and restarting a mission after failing is ZERO load time.   I'm playing with a Logitech 3D Pro stick and it works perfectly after button mapping.  The game is set up for a 360 gamepad by default.  It also supports mouse control BUT that isn't quite working just yet.   Views are cockpit, 3rd person, and no-cockpit gunsight views.  Hold a key/button to momentarily padlock the current enemy, so you don't get lost in all the chaos.There's multiplayer, and even a dedicated server you can download.  I played some skirmish with the AI, and had them turned up a difficulty notch plus had too many of them fighting me, and I can attest the my end was brutal and swift.  :-)  The only thing I really feel absent is a nice hammy voiceover of the character dialogue.  The voice work in Crimson Skies was superb and really brought the game to life.  Reading the text balloons just isn't the same.  A pretty small complaint considering how much goodness is going on here for $12.DO IT.			"

								Just picked up a copy.. and loving it. It's very reminiscent of Crimson Skies in its inspiration (my first thought was Crimson Skies meets Porco Rosso) and the flight model feels similar to CS in that it's jump in and fly rather than a sit your PPL first simulation.As has been noted.. the dialogue (English version) could do with some loving, but other than that, it's rather fun. Interested to see just how it develops.. :)			"

								I can't figure out how this one slipped by my radar, but I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it out. The flying places itself nicely between arcady flyers such as Ace Combat and more advanced games such as the IL2 series. Although not required, a decent joystick setup makes this game a joy to fly, and it even supports TrackIR for those who are serious about their flight simulators (Oculus Rift support was added recently as well). The aerial combat is reasonably plausible, and a working knowledge of advanced combat maneuvers will come in handy as the AI seems to be subject to the same rules of physics as the player. The storyline gives a bit of background to the fuss and although not perfect, it does the job reasonably well.The missions are varied and there are actually some flying challenges in there (tricky landings) that is fun to pull off. The views are almost on par with what one would expect from a flightsim, and I primarly fly from the cockpit view with TrackIR. BOMB reminds a lot of the old Microsoft title Crimson Skies, and although this is a much smaller developer, the visuals are very pleasing and very functional. If you are not into flying games or flight simulators this game is probably not for you, but I can highly recommend this to any flightsimmer that enjoys ""seat-of-pants"" flying. I really hope the game does well and that the developer has a passion for this type of game. With the current graphics engine and development skills, if applied correctly, this is perhaps an outfit that can bring us the next iteration of Origin's Strike Commander (one can dream, right?). Good luck to La Moustace Studio!			"

												Not ready for prime time. I liked Crimson Skies, and this game attempts to emulate much of what made that a fun game. There are a lot of rough edges: random crashes in the middle of a mission, a mission that does not end even when you completed all the objectives, visual effects that suddenly pop up, collisions with objects that you are near but have not in fact collided with, etc. I really do hope they spend the effort to fix this one up. The graphics are fine, not cutting edge, but there is a real need for a game in this genre.			"

												Now that it's out of early access... It looked like a great game, it has a lot of potential, but the control support is awful. This is, without any doubt, the worst controlling game of any type or genre, that I've ever played since 1995.  Really really really reeeeaaaallly awful. With a 360 controller, the handling ranges from pretty bad to terrible. With a flight stick... well, it just doesn't map functionally onto a stick, so forget about it. With the keyboard it's.... Jesus, it's real bad.Controls are a crucial part of any flight sim/arcade game and the control support isn't anywhere near being good enough to recommend.			"

												Nowhere near ready to leave early access.  Let me premise this with how I love the theme and gameplay.  It really is a successor to Crimson Skies.Has/had a lot of potential, but looking at how rarely it's updated, I don't have much faith the following issues will be resolved:- Some aircraft do not have cockpits-The ones that do, the sights seem to not line up with the guns.  Leading targets can be sporadic.  If it's not the sights, then it's the following:- The primary machine guns do very, very little damage.  You'll often waste 10+ minutes chasing a single fighter getting hit after hit, but they won't go down.- Text in many places is full of typos; poorly translated to english.- Some missions are very easy, then others ramp up in difficulty with no checkpoints or way to repair.- Overall lack of polish, between the GUI and lack of optimization			"

												feels a lot like the original il-2 sturmovik in skirmish mode, allowing you to set ground and air targets to rapidly create combat scenarios.  Loadout, physics and handling are a lot like that game also.  I love DCS and il2:BOS and this is an 'acid' simplified version of that.  It's not an arcade flight model or damage model and so I can see why some people feel unempowered by it.  Personally I hate the sort of arcade 'sim'lites where the player destroys hundreds of arcade enemies.AI is very good, graphics are beautiful and the planes feel heavy and (to me) engaging, looking like WW2 pod racers/wachy racers.  A great game if you want a beautiful wacky/ porco rosso version of il2's skirmish mode.  I'll update with my thoughts on the campaign later.  Also runs well in DX9 on a GTX260 - which is impressive to me.Such a pity people have been so negative.			"

												I want to love this game, but can't. The initial airplane is such a lumbering dog and no fun to fly or fight in at all and the missions have too many sections with no mid-game saving that I've never made it past the third mission. I was so excited to see a Crimson Skies inspired game, but BOMB just doesn't cut it for me. Maybe later planes are good, but I've nver got that far. As a minor note the game text is full of typos and the UI is really basic and unfriendly, but I know the team are small and are trying their best, so it pains me to not recommend this game, but I just don't enjoy it.  :(			"

First off, you don't feel like flying, it feels like you are moving in a swamp of goo.  The camera controls are whacky and make no sense, and they get all out of whack, and you can't get the correct positioning back.  The missions feel totally unneeded.  It's just not fun.    You don't get any sense of speed.... it's not a sim, and it's not quick like arcade feel, it's some weird in-between.  Heck you don't even really feel like you're flying.  I'm a private pilot and I'm not quite sure what this is.    I think the general feeling of this is ""Half Baked"".			"

												Bomb is a very cool dogfighting game with a unique challenge. I love the fact that they dont baby you through shooting at enemies, like giving you a  little pointer telling you exactly where to shoot. I would also like to point out that some of the bad reviews have less than an hour of game time, which is when you have the first crappy plane in the story. You need to invest about 2 hours to get the next plane, less if you are especially skilled. The next plane is far better and way more fun to fly with, and is needed to keep up with the advancing diffuculty in the story, which has some fairly charming characters. The one thing that makes me laugh so hard but also bugs me slightly is when the AI tries to avoid you and miscalculates a maneuver and crashes into the ground. this happens more often than I would like to admit, but this only happens when there are large amounts of enemies. the AI could use a slight upgrade, but the game already is diffucult, so maybe not.

It's not DCS or even War Thunder level of realism, but damn good fun.  A few negatives (to me anyway).  While it's an arcade ""funny"" kind of story, I'm not a fan of the cartoon-type look.   But strangely enough it works here.  Also...it needs some more instant action options (which the Devs are considering). I've only flown the first few missions of the Campaign and it is very reminiscent of Crimson Skies.And best of all?  IT SUPPORTS TRACKIR!!!!  A big thanks to the Devs for that one.Well worth $12.

												Many games - Blazing Angels, AirConflicts and now Bomb - have tried to emulate Crimson Skies' success and failed miserably! Why?Because it isn't simply enough to take an arcade aircombat shooter and combine it with a more or less interesting story. Yes, Crimson Skies backstory is pretty interesting, as are the characters and the dialogues are witty. But this is just the glue that holds it all together.The secret of Crimson Skies success is, it gives you the illusion to be this daredevil fighter pilot who not only kicks his opponent's ♥♥♥ like an ace but who is also a skillful stunt pilot.The environments in Crimson Skies are interesting and challenging, while in the above mentioned games they are only beautiful window dressing. What a wasted opportunity!The only game I can think of that uses the environments the same way Crimson Skies did, is DogFighter. But this game is only a multiplayer platform. One moment you fly through the Great Canyon - the next through an Egyptian pyramid... Why? You are shooting at areoplanes! Why?Everything in this games feels complete arbitrary!Who knows? If the developers had invested in an interesting story driven campaign... this just might have been the next Crimson Skies!And finally - Crimson Skies only fault was... it came at least 10 years too early! What an amazing game it would be with today's graphics! I wonder why nobody thought about remastering it!? It would be the license to print money!Unfortunately Bomb is falling short towards those expectations: the dogfights are tedious and repetitive (one basically cycles endlessly until an enemy plane comes in view and then tries to shoot it down). Worst of all: the saving points are too far apart. One has to fight off wave after wave of opponents (like swarms of mosquitos) and when one fails at the end of the mission one is forced to replay the last 20 minutes of tedious gameplay! This kills the game for me!			"

								A very imaginative and streamlined take on a flight action game that doesn't overcomplicate itself so much that it's inaccessible, yet doesn't feel too mechanical and arcadey.Pros:-beautiful stylized environments-unique and fun to fly aircraft-decent flight model-amusing writing -decently varied campaign missions-AI is clever enough to use the aircraft's advantages, but not exploitative of the mechanics, which means fights are always winnable if not always easy-the boost mechanic is a neat idea that prevents fights from descending into two planes just flying in circlesCons:-tends to be on the buggy side, with the occasional invisible plane popping up-only a few aircraft have cockpits modeled, and flying from external view makes the game way too easy, in my opinion-frame rate tends to chug a lot, especially close to the ground-missions tend to be combat-oriented in the campaign, which means the player doesn't really get to explore and admire the scenery-loading times are rather long for such a light game (only about a 1 GB install)			"

												I really wanted to enjoy this game as I've always been a huge fan of the flight sims that straddle the line between arcade and realism.  But after the fourth time I had to reload one of the first few mission because of gameplay bugs, I gave up.  The first time, it gives me the conversation text as I'm lifting off, but doesn't mark my objective.  The second time it didn't give me even the conversation text.  The third time it crashed to the desktop.  The fourth time it seemed like everything was going to work, but then the target I was supposed to intercept shot away from me at a speed I couldn't match and then just kept running.  I chased him at max speed for roughly five minutes before I quit and made use of steam's new refund policy.Also, having the overdrive or afterburner (or whatever it is called) just being the last 5% or so of the thrust throttle is very poor design.  Adjusting the throttle on a Logitech Extreme 3D Pro Joystick to the maximum speed without also hitting the afterburner is a headache of micro adjustments.  But that's a headache that I'd have happily lived with if I could have actually progressed the game.Good concept, with a lot of potential fun, but it should have stayed in early access.			"

												Will this be the moment where I find a new favorite pastime, quit my day job, and dedicate my life to becoming a world-class pilot? Well, if that is my purpose in life, BOMB did not awaken my inner aviator. Join me while I play the first part of this game so you can understand why my excitement never lifted off and soared through the skies.

												Its a nice intro to flight sims, with a responsive dev team and straightforward gameplay. There's nothing in here for hardcore flight sim players, but I'd recommend it for people who have never played a flight sim and are interested in trying it out. Very arcadey. Look for it on sale.

												I've been waiting for this one to get out of Early Access, and it's been nice to play the final release version at last. This is the sort of air combat game that I miss, removed from the dour 'realism' that most games have been confined to recently. I'll admit, I might be biased by nostalgia for a certain franchise, but I can honestly recommend this game for trying to take an old idea and give it a new coat of paint.			"

												In short6/10+Story Background+Mechanic Design+Interesting Air Battle+Realistic Air Battle compare to other arcade style flight games such as ""Heroes in the sky"",""World of Warplanes""+Details on the planes- Mouse control ruined the game experience (((unacceptable)))I love the background,the air battles are fun,I like the mech designs,but there is one thing I must say.The mouse control mode is TERRIBLE.Obviously the dev did not test much about the god damn mouse control mode.There are so many problems,limited pitching angle,rudder doesn't response to mouse controlling,the poor camera angle,it always went wrong direction after you quit the focus mode.They are tolerable,but still gave me an unsatisfied gaming experience.However,after you jump into the new plane KAK-B in mouse control mode,it soon became a nightmare--random camera shaking,the plane itself shaking,the plane is too sensitive to every move of my mouse,made me very dizzy and struggled to fight.They should learn from WarThunder,or they did but just simply messed up.Although the other parts of the game is fine,I will give the game 6/10 due to the poor mouse control.

												Launched it in Linux. It freezes at the prelude. Waited several minutes for something to happen, and nothing did. If you fix your game, I'll be happy to publish a better review for it. Thank you.			"

												Pity can not save after every battle. Most of the time I only have about 20 min to spare. Other than that pretty fun. Havn't played many dog fight games though.			"

												I'd thought about getting this game for a while having had my curiosity piqued by rumours is was Crimson Skies-esque, but I was also somewhat put off by the mixed reviews. In the end I got it on sale, and I have to say I have enjoyed the experience.My first impressions weren't great, the game could use some more optimisation, there's the odd issue with the view clipping into things (mainly the seat in the seaplane), the lack of voice acting gives the tendency to skip over the dialogue, which made the writing come across poorly at first, not half due to the typos...But once I really sat down and gave it a chance, I really started to get into it (getting my joystick set up helped a little). I came to like the characters, I REALLY liked the second aircraft you get, and the humour was good enough for my tastes. The game could definitely use some polish, more planes, cockpits for all of them, etc. But the core of the game is there and it has its charm. The flight model strikes a good balance I feel, being realistic enough to sate the pedant in me, but arcadey enough to let you think solely about the fight. The overall effect was really just to inflate my opinion of my flying skills, which is about the best a game like this can do, and what War Thunder fell short of for me.The (British) price of £5.59 works out at just SLIGHTLY over a pound per hour based on my Campaign (5.4 hours), which is my method for determining whether playtime was long enough for the money, so it's acceptable. I'd have liked it to be longer. I'd have liked some customisation. But I had a jolly good romp nevertheless, and I would buy this game again.			"

												I am sorry that I cannot recommend this game.  ALthough some people seem to be able to play OK, I was plagued with controller issues.I tried with both a joystick (Sidewinder FF2) and a gamepad (xbox 360).  After several tries I was finally able to bind the pitch, roll, yaw, and thrust axes to the joystick, but I was still not able to control the plane.  For instance, sometimes it would start out OK, but then it would start to dive and pulling the stick all the way back would only level the plane but it wold not climb.  Afer a half hour of this frustration I gave up and requested a refund.  I liked the concept of the game and had looked forward to getting it for a couple of years, so I was disapponted that I nver got it to work.			"
