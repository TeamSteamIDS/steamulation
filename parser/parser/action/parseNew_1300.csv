												65%SiN is the ORIGINAL half-life mod. The game is so bland and predictable, and so much like every other FPS you've ever played in the last 10 years, but it was the FIRST of its kind. You think starting a game with a heli-mounted machine gun section is a filthy cliche? SiN INVENTED that. Cover based shooting? Charging berzerker bosses? Terrible voice acting? Unplayable forced stealth sections? Sewer levels? SiN is guilty of every cliche in the modern FPS dictionary because it INVENTED every cliche in the modern FPS dictionary. SiN is so far ahead of it's time while paradoxically so stuck in the past that it boggles my mind.The levels are unintuitive, and will have you backtracking constantly. The enemies are either far too easy or tear off 50% of your health unavoidably. The weapons are uninspired and bland as all hell. The stealth is garbage and isn't even worth attempting unless you HAVE to. The game is absolute balls compared to it's source material, but you know what? Blade, the protagonist is the most Bad♥♥♥♥♥Mofo I have EVER played, the levels are supremely rewarding, the voice acting may be♥♥♥♥♥♥ but is full of charm. The game is beautifully cinematic in a B-movie sort of way.SiN is a masterpiece, it is so fantastically average, it exists in trancendant mediocrity. SiN is the BEST WORST GAME EVER MADE.(0 or 10)/10			"

												***I WROTE THIS REVIEW IN 2006... Found it on my HD and reposted it because I felt it still holds up- hope you enjoy it***Gameplay: If you figured the gameplay would be similar to Half-Life 2 because they use the same engine, you would figure correctly.  The movement of the characters, the inside and outside environment with impressive lighting and of course the physics are almost identical to Half-Life 2.   Because SiN uses the same engine has HL2, one might think the games would be so strikingly similar SiN would completely rip off Hl2 in its entirely.  Although the enemies are similar, both games include soldiers in armored suit that sounds like they are talking out of some sort of walkie-talkie, there is enough original material for you to forget about HL2 and start thinking SiN. One of the more original ideas is to take the healing method from HL2 and modify it. SiN makes you search for empty canisters that can be found throughout the game, and carry them to wall mounted health stations where they can be used to spray a healing blue cloud.  Other times when you are too lazy to carry the canister, you can just shoot them and the healing cloud will be released around the area, allowing a quick heal but not as complete as it would have been if you had taken it to the station. Another neat feature they added was a type of chemical agent, that when exposed to, it increased your response time dramatically.  What does that mean? Well it means they kinda copied F.E.A.R and Max Payne and slowed down time a bit so the player can react to apposing enemies better.  This feature is not controllable, but rather goes into affect when a canister is broken in a gun battle and you walk through he green cloud.  The time it takes to wear off is represented as a green bar on the left side of the screen.  But be careful.  Too much exposure will result in the loss of health. Over the course of the game, Blade will interact with a few different characters.  We saw in HL2 how impressive Valve was able to create life like faces and by playing through the game, you can see this effect was used in SiN. Blade also fights along side the hot Jessica Cannon who pretty much resembles Alyx from HL2 and does most of the talking.  But Alyx didn't have her thong strings poking above her hips now did she? Gun battles are similar to HL2.  You are given a handgun at the propitiate time and gradually upgrade to an assault rifle and shotgun, but that's it. I'm guessing the plan on releasing more guns as the episodes continue, but it gets a little repetitive using the same guns after a while.  Most of the soldiers are easy to kill, until you get to the more armored mini-gun soldiers.  One thing SiN lacks that HL2 incorporated so well was a scare factor.  SiN ignores this approach and aims for a more typical shooter where you can see your enemy coming from a couple of feet down the hall or road.  A couple of notes as I investigated SiN a bit further.  I read afterwards that SiN apparently keeps track of your shooting statistics.   The data isn't kept for you to print out and nail to your dorm room wall, but the game actually analyzes the data and will adjust the difficulty level of the game as your progress through the game.  For example; if the game see that out of your last 10 kills, 9 of them were headshots, you may see soldiers appear with helmets or dodge your fire more often.  As I think about it now, I can remember a few instances in the game where I tired to kill an armored soldier and took a lot more ammo then I previously had used.  Very impressive idea for the date of this game. Graphics/Sound: SiN is filled with crisp luminous lighting in various different areas of the game.  The soft pastel sunset with a mirrored reflection over the water looks great and need I say HL2ish?  There are numerous scenes throughout the game where you stop fighting and shooting, and just take a moment to look at the scenery, or when you're inside, look at the detail of some of the rooms. The monster and mutant skins are nothing special, except for the two giant ones you end up fighting, but I have a feeling they are going to release a few more enemies in the next episode. Again, the faces on most of the characters look extremely realistic and in the very opening scene, you will notice an obvious feature that they added to one of the bad guys…or should I say bad girl.  Pros: Fast paced, inspired visuals from HL2, interesting story, check out all the hot chicks! Cons: Only 3 weapons Bottom Line: For $9.99 you will receive a fun, quick FPS shooter.  It's a bummer Ritual claimed they have 4-6 more hours of upcoming episodes, which were eventually canceled. The entire episode took  between 3-4 to complete.			"

												A very interesting and nuanced game besieged by a couple of issues and unexplained and wonky plot that was intended to be cleared up by the third episode. Unfortunately, it didn't sell enough to make a sequel. It recouped costs, but didn't even get near the jumping-off point they needed for EP2. So, Ritual was bought by MumboJumbo, a casual games outfit, and SiN is doomed to the aether of inexistence.One of the most prolific devs, Levelord (A parallel Gabe if there was one) has entirely moved on* from the games industry and without his influence the odds are not a single peep will ever be heard again from SiN. Which is a shame, because it showed promise.A doomed sequel to a relatively unknown game that got clouded out by Quake 2 and Half-Life. Such a waste of potential that it died so soon. Worth a buy and a play.* Source: http://www.shacknews.com/article/75336/where-are-they-now-richard-levelord-gray "

												Awesome FPS game but extremely short; the shortest FPS game I've ever played (3 hours or less).  I bought this at the time of release and replayed it recently only to realize what a gem it is. Great mix of 'duck and cover' & 'run and gun' style gameplay though you could do it all run and gun style.  The only thing I didn't like was the fact that the game only has 3 guns (plus grenades). But what do you expect in 2006? That was around the time military shooters were on the rise to become the hot new style of FPS.If you like FPS games of the same era like Quake 4, Doom 3, Prey or even the latter Duke Nukem Forver, you'll love this game.

												Emergence was to be the first episode in a series of 9 following up the story of the original SiN. At the time, the decision to pursue episodic gaming in general, and especially episodic FPS gaming through self-funding was innovative and unique - and the return of an FPS brand as classic as SiN was quite something.To this day, Emergence remains a really great game that plays very well, with terrific level design, solid art direction, good gunplay and an astounding amount of interactivity. The issue is that at times, it hardly feels like SiN. It doesn't help that Emergence essentially only offers up the first 2-3 chapters of what was to be a much larger game, and includes only 3 weapons, 3 enemy types and not a whole lot in the way of secrets, bonus objectives, action-based outcomes, computer systems or anything else.Much like its predecessor, Emergence shipped with a few serious bugs and, generally, to very little fanfare. It broke even, but did not make enough money to support development of the next episode for an expanded team. Some months later, Ritual was forced to lay off most of its developers and was then acquired by Mumbo Jumbo. The rest is casual gaming history, until someone decided Ritual's corpse was worth resuscitating for a GOG re-release of SiN 1 in 2014. Thanks for nothing, Mumbo Jumbo.However, Emergence is still very much worth playing today. It's one of the best shooters of the later 2000s and the untimely demise of the Episodes remains one of the great tragedies of FPS gaming. And it also comes bundled with the original SiN, which in my opinion means you get two terrific FPSes for the price of half an FPS. Go for it!			"

SiN Episodes: Emergence		* 7/10I enjoyed the first SiN long time ago, so when I heard of this ""sequel"" I was very interested. Unfortunately this is the only Episode of this new chapter.SiN Episodes is an FPS based on Half-Life 2 Source engine, but while the phisycs ingame constantly provide some laughs for the usual odd and random ""dead postures"" I really missed one of the innovations from the first SiN: the armor system. But besides that the game is fine after all, there are cutscenes, a good music that follows and push the action (not to mention the Killer menu theme which I definitely love), the settings are very suggestive so we find the classic laboratories, sewers and now we see also a Dock, and a Huge building called ""supremacy Tower"". As usual there are a few minor bugs mostly temporary getting stuck between objects like chairs, or maybe gates that won't open because there are (or have been) some props over there. Nothing that a good jump or Checkpoint load can't solve.What this sequel miss in my humble opinion is the innovation of the first game, with ambience and computers interactions, the aforementioned armor system, stealth sections. This franchise had potential but it doesn't add anything particular or new to the genre. The story starts good, but the lack of explanations (supposedly postponed to a second episode that never came out) doesn't help much.This doesn't mean this title is bad, I mean: it's well designed, it starts with a good story and all and even though this Episode lasted quite longer than I could have expected it doesn't bring any innovation like its predecessor did.+++PROs+++ STORY. A new chapter for this saga that moves on the story from the first title. Elexis is back and is planning with Radek, another criminal, some projects to take over the city, maybe the world. Yes, she's totally crazy, but she's a nice stereotype sometimes acting as the classic villain, sometimes acting impredictable. MUSIC. The ingame music doesn't really shine with any particular or recurrent theme but it follows and motivates the action sections. Unlike the main menu theme... Which I definitely love and listen even nowadays... LEVEL DESIGN. The levels present a beautiful setting and interior design (considering the engine, of course), and even though there are the usual kind of settings seen in the first title there are new and accurately designed locations. SiN. Together with Sin Episodes you get the original SiN!---CONs--- AI. The enemies actually are not a partcular threat. They run shooting at you and sometimes they look for cover... When they don't explode over their own granades... BUGS. Just few bugs, luckily but they're still here and there: personally I've got stuck between chairs, and later a gate refused to open because there are (or have been) some props over there. Still these are minor issues, as I got unstuck by insisting on jumping in all directions  and for the gate I've just loaded a close auto-checkpoint. LACK OF INNOVATION. Actually I've found this SiN Episode a common well designed FPS as there's no particular innovation unlike its predecessor which featured computer terminals interactions, the aforementioned armor system and stealth sections. And I know there are sections where you can move a platform and computers where there are some door controls but it's not the same as the original SiN as the terminals had more particular functions and easter eggs.SiN			* 7/10I remember being a huge fan of this game when videogames magazines with CDs full of demos were the thing. I'll be honest I just loved the Gun and the sniper rifle, their design was simply badass. However I've never been able to finish it, so when I found out that it came as a bonus with Sin Episodes: Emergence I thought it was a good chance to finish it once and for all... B-)SiN is a 1998 classic FPS based on the good old Quake II Engine. There are many little things that really hit me, both at the time and nowadays. The setting is the Freeport metropolis in a near future where police has been replaced by private security forces, which Blade (the protagonist) is part of. So we see modern/near future-like bank offices, laboratories, slums, sewers, a Dam and more. Besides the nice level design (especially for the times) there are some interesting elements like few drivable vehicles, usable computers with open-close commands and sometimes interesting prompt command menus, civilians and hostages which you need to save, a few stealth situations (optional, but still preferable). Still one of the most interesting and studied news is a well used Ghoul System, so now it actually matters shooting on a head or on legs. And that's not all because both you and enemies can wear bullet-proof protections and they are categorized according to the ghoul system, so you have helmet, jacket and pants which protect those parts. So As you shoot your enemies in different parts they might drop damaged vests. Very clever.The story isn't much the strong side of the game: in the aforementioned Freeport thre's a criminality escalation. A dangerous drug named U4 is spreading in the streets and the game starts during a Bank heist we must stop. Our ""gunned investigations"" will bring us to linking U4 to a big corporation that is producing it. Like I said it's not the most original plot, but the gameplay is leading the way As well as some polygonal fan service...+++PROs+++ SETTINGS. The best thing of the game is obviously the setting. I like the levels, the situations, the weapons design (yes, I love them, don't ask why). INNOVATION. I have to say that there are some very interesting little things in the game that were not that frequent at the time. Like the simple but really effective direction in the introduction scene at the Bank heist, or other dialogues or small scenes. They were not great nor perfect, but they were a very good and nice attempt at something new. Plus the aforementioned vehicles, Ghoul and Armour system, Interactive computer interfaces. I know nowadays these don't have any value but I remember playing at the time, and I can contextualize these innovations. Though maybe this nostalgia might make me look not much objective. MUSIC. I wasn't going to include this, but there are a few themes here and there that are really astonishing. Jungle and Mansion are my favourite, of course.---CONs--- COMPATIBILITY & ISSUES. Well, there's obviously no support nowadays and it would be of use because there's a low limited Resolution, the aspect ratio is 4:3, no adjustable brightness, there are some issues with movement and mouselook, and maybe even more. There are some solutions in the community but actually they made it worse. I've played in the classic resolution, 4:3 ratio, mouse was working fine and movement was overall responding with a few moments situations of misalignment. What makes me mad is that there's a DRM free version on GOG which I've read being adapted for modern systems... -.-On the bright side there's a guide in the steam community that explains how to update the game. Unfortunately it doesn't fix any of these issues but looks like it was meant to fix worse bugs and problems. LOADING TIMES. They are ridiculously long, even on nowadays machines... -.- STORY. The story is pretty simple, even if there are some interesting turning points that can give a change in the gameplay. WAGES OF SIN. Unfortunately there's no Expansion in the store (but there is in GOG... -.-) but if you own the old CD there's a way to make it work, reported in a guide in the Steam community. But unfortunately I couldn't test it because I don't have the original CD... :( "

												I do not understand why the store page disappeared for this title. I wonder if anybody can see / read my review of this game.SIN was an interesting FPS at the end of the '90s. It had a lot of scripted events and some really good action sequences. The game was also very difficult (or at least this is how I remember). I guess a lot of people played Half Life instead so perhaps not many gamers remember this title. Emergence meant to be a sequel but with the new Source engine developed by Valve. The creators wanted to release follow-up episodes but it seems Emergency was not successful enough for this to happen. It is a pity as the game is quite good. It can be completed in a mere 3-4 hours due to its shortness, though.I played its demo years ago so when it was offered with a discount bundled with the original game (released in 1998) I instantly grabbed it.PS: It seems the store page is up and running so there's no issue with this.

												What HL2 should have been.Fast paced, fun, explosive, and incomplete, SiN : Emergence is one of the saddest things in the universe.This was supposed to be an episodic series of short first person shooters (this may not have been the smartest idea), but the company went bankrupt and was bought off to make casual games after half of the team left the studio.The company was killed by ridiculous marketing. Nobody in their right mind would pay 10 euros for a 2-3 hours long episode.However, I consider this well worth the asking price.Not only for the original SiN (it's pure gold) but also because this little episode is very interesting.The core gameplay manages to be fun and stay fresh with only 3 weapons (A very reliable pistol, a shotgun, and an SMG), incendiary grenades, a melee attack, and a secondary fire for every weapon.That's pretty impressive.The level design is very similar to something like SoF, with some elements borrowed from HL2.Think HL 2 on steroids.You're constantly running around, jumping, shooting stuff, and fighting your way through well designed arenas.The experience will leave you wondering what amazing things could have come from Ritual.

												While it may not be the most groundbreaking of shooters, Emergence's merits far outweigh its smattering of faults, and with six to ten hours of entertainment to be had, you can't argue that it's not value for money, especially as it also comes bundled with a copy of the original SiN.I nominated this game for: The “Test Of Time” Award of this Steam Autumn Sale of 2016, because it brings back to me my great childhood memories of playing the series of SiN.

												A perfect entry in a series now discontinued games, it would have made you wonder what the next episodes would've been like - this game tells the next chapter in the story of SiN, preceeded by the original game entitled simply ""SiN""The game follows the story of the main character, Blade, who (without going in to too much detail) has been injected with the U4 drug, a powerful chemical used to transform humans in to grotesque recombinant creatues, and he must find justice against Elexis Sinclaire, the woman who had the proceedure done to him and who is threatening the lives of potentially everyone in the world.The game is diverse in it's enemies, one moment, you're fighting jetpack ninjas, the next, giant quadrapedal mutants who throw energized chunks of earth at you; this is part of the game that deserves heavy merit, as the designs of both the mutants and the humans alike are very unique, and much different from those of the original SiN characters.Furthermore, it's weapon variety, while vastly limited from the original SiN, still manages to keep the game entertaining, with grenades that ignite enemies in it's vicinity of blast, to magnums that fire tracer rounds, and even shotguns that fire ricochetting pellets, you never lose the charm of using the same weapons over and over again to execute the same NPCs, probably the most entertaining thing about these weapons is being able to blow the visor and helmet off a ninja's unsuspecting head.Finally, the level design is splendid, while the same industrial feeling is kept constant and applied to every single level, giving it a rather unadventurous feeling at some points, it manages to keep it's style consistant; debris covering every area that demands it, stunning views of the industrial regions, cities vehicles, towering buildings and skyscrapers, as well as dark, gloomy sewers and the abandoned interior of a ship, this game certainly keeps on giving, and again, it really does raise the question of what the newer entries in the series could have been like, it can only get better with story advancement, surely, but with the sad truth of the developers, Ritual going defunct, the tale of SiN will never be complete.For what it is, an episode in what would have been a full series of nine games, it surely does deliver, and provides an excellent amount of gameplay to get you interested in the story, which may have been kept short due to Ritual's demise, but is still effective in encapsulating your experience with the game in the goals that Blade surely strived for himself.Rating: 4.5 / 5 stars.

												That this series never made it past the first episode is one of the greatest losses in the history of gaming.It is awesome.I know the Half-Life series gets a lot of credit - as well it should.  But the Half-Life series has some serious gameplay flaws - like being forced to complete platforming puzzles without being able to see your own feet, or constant reliance on those annoying and frustrating sandlions, and so on.This is a Source engine game, and it plays very much like Half-Life 2, just without those glaring flaws that have become even more glaring over time.This game holds up extremely well.  In the days of PhysX, its use of native Source engine physics is still impressive.  It's level design is consumate.  It's difficulty can be adjusted incredibly well.  The voice acting is as decent as you can expect from a game of its day.Indeed - and in a very real way - if you can look past the unfinished plot, you will see glimpses of gaming brilliance that, sadly, went unnoticed in its day, and largely still does.If you have $9.99 and love shooters, this game is a must-have, especially now that nearly everyone has the tech in their rigs to max its settings to proper HD, enhance with proprietary GPU driver filters, and really enjoy the experience as the designers intended.There are some flaws in the game itself, but bear in mind it was supposed to be the 1st of 9 episodes.  These flaws are an over-reliance on just one or two types of enemies, for example, and a few bugs in the AI that, understandably, never got patched.  Unfortunately, it is just plain tough to tell where the designers were going with enemy design and how these one or two basic enemies were going to relate to what may have come.All of that said, just drop the tenner and get it.  It deserves it, and maybe, just maybe, if enough people show interest, the series will be picked up again.93/100			"

Oh yeah and 10/10 jiggle bone placement on the ladies, that made me smile and laugh. But instead of spewing random things I'll say this, I know you're here from Inside Gam- I mean, uh Funhaus...

												SiN Episodes is saddly only very short, as it was meant to be the first of 9 episodes and was later put on hold indefinitely, due to a corporate takeover that forced the team at Ritual to develop casual games. Nonetheless, this is gold. The characters, music, gameplay, it's simply a lot of fun. And while the story is believeable it does not take itself too seriously either. If you want to see how much fun it can really be, look at a video from Inside Gaming (now FunHouse) on YouTube entitled ""Who needs Half-Life 3?"". I guarantee you will laugh tears... BLADE!			"

												Really short 1st person shooter on Half Life 2 engine. Engine itself was a masterpiece back in the day, with great physics system and complex character facial animation in dialogues. Game itself is ""no brainer"" shooter, with occasional humor and voluptuous SinTEK corporation Mistress as the main antagonist. You play as cop, John Blade on mission to put Elexis Sinclair behind bars. Story is badly written and most of the time don't make much sense, but game is worth the spent cash, even if it's only to gaze on beautiful Elexis. ;)Let's hope we will get a reboot / continuation of SiN games in future.

This game perhaps lacks of weapons (mines, crossbow,..) and finally perhaps a little bit too short because no episodic sequel but overall i really enjoyed this game:I've noticed an interesting use of Source engine in the level progression! The story isn't really its best asset but the gunfights are dynamic thanks to an advanced AI and different fire modes for each weapons it's really pleasant!NB: Keep in mind that the package includes: Sin (original+multi) & SDK (episode 1)Tips: As far as I'm concerned i've use sv_cheats 1 & impulse 101 for more fun!

												The game starts badly, with a few very cringe-worthy boob and bikini sequences. If you try to ignore all that, then it is actually a pretty good game. There is a rather poor choice of guns, which aren’t implemented that well. The bots are about as dumb as they get and the episode is really short so all in all not worth the £19.99 it cost when it came out. Even now at £5.99, I think the game is overpriced. Is it recommended? Yes, but definitely one for the sales! The bundled SiN is a better game but is of course much older and really hasn't weathered well at all. It also needs a special bug-fix downloading that is very difficult to find. "

												Buy it just for the main menu song. The game is slightly worse than Unreal 2, but at least it comes with the original SiN too.If you want it just for SiN, just buy SiN Gold from GOG.com instead. It comes with both SiN and Wages of SiN.Here's reviews for the entire SiN series anyway:SiN (1998)The main game. It did many things that were groundbreaking for its time, but was overshadowed by Half-Life because it launched with tons of bugs that put people off, whom left for Half-Life and never touched SiN again. Even so, SiN's achievements are still unique in the history of FPS because what it did has not been replicated since; not even by Half-Life and its sequels.Such amazing feats include the much-touted Action-Based Outcomes, where things you do in a level can affect what happens next. Like other old FPS, there's multiple ways to progress through a level, but unlike them, SiN does so in a much more interactive way, such as using computer terminals. You might even find secret sections or levels if you are observant. Other feats include an extremely versatile scripting system that allows things in the game to act in many awesome ways. It ranges from brush manipulation (vehicles, scenery destruction) to enemy tactics. While most games these days are heavily-scripted, none have done the ABO system like SiN did. Also, did I forget to mention this is the first FPS to feature in-engine cutscenes?Even without these feats, SiN still holds pretty well on its own. SiN features an engaging (if not cheesy) comic book-like character-driven story set in a dystopic city called Freeport where law enforcement is run by private security forces. The most respected one among all; HardCorps; is led by our hardcore and just hero, Colonel John R.(Rusty) Blade; who is assisted by his hacker sidekick, the geeky yet reliable J.C.; and together they must face the menace of evil Elexis Sinclaire, genius biochemist, self-proclaimed Mother Nature, and CEO of the corrupt multinational corporation; SinTek Industries. The story begins in the year 2037, when the highly addictive drug 'U4' (Dyforsanide) is at its peak and it's up to Blade and J.C. to stop Antonio Mancini, who seems to be behind the sudden outbreak of the drug, and find out the source of all the weird happenings around Freeport City lately.It may not sound like much, but it's certainly more than what Half-Life has to offer (no, having the same plot as Doom but with things that are never explained does not constitute for a deep or good story). Blade is rocking the late 90s FPS hero attitude and his humorous back-and-forth snarks with J.C. keeps the characters interesting.As for the technical aspects of the game; the graphics is about what you'd expect from a Quake 2 engine game, but it still holds up today and the scripting in the game may surprise you every now and then. The sound design may be a bit shoddy, but the music and voice acting is top-notch and spot-on. The levels are very well-designed; lifelike in the sense that you solve puzzles logically; and allows for endless replayability. The weapons may be standard and the enemies can be difficult at times, but the diverse cast of chatacters and environments will keep you interested until the end.Overall, I'd give it a 9/10 due to technical shortcomings, but its innovations has certainly secured it a high rank on my list of great games.Wages of SiN (1999)Expansion pack of the main game, brought to you by a small team of developers known as 2015, Inc. You may have known them for creating forgettable franchises later on such as Call of Duty, after most of the original team left the company to form Infinity Ward.Now, onto the actual game itself. Despite being an expansion pack with only 16 levels as opposed to the original's 36, it features a more cohesive experience than the main game. The pacing felt much better, and there was an interesting concept in the game where an action you took in one of the early levels decides the order and gameplay of the next several levels.Set several weeks after the events of SiN, the expansion pack continues the story with Blade combating the recent increase of mafia-related violence and how it all connects to the rise of the notorious mob boss, Gianni Manero.The game did not change much from SiN, though it did introduce 7 new weapons and 10 new enemies. The new enemies aren't anything out of the ordinary, but the new weapons are far from the standard FPS-fare like the ones in the main game and are very fun to play with. Overall, it too gets a 9/10 and shares a seat with the main game.SiN: The Movie (2000)This 1-hour OVA is a loose retelling of the events of the original game. Thus it features many discrepancies between it and the game.Its premise is mostly the same, but the plot develops differently. It's set in 2070, Blade is a cyborg, J.C. is replaced by his sister; Jennifer Armack; and they must stop Elexis from kidnapping a little girl or something.It's your generic cheap ultra-gory 90s anime with forgettable plot. There's really nothing else to say about it.It gets a 5/10.SiN Episodes: Emergence (2006)The first and only Episode of a planned total of nine. The game is set in 2041. Elexis Sinclaire reemerged from the shadows and with the assistance of the elusive Viktor Radek, her ambitions still hasn't slowed down. After failing to prove the wrongdoings of Elexis and SinTek to the public, Blade returns to combat the threat together with his new sidekick Jessica Cannon, a hot-blooded but skilled rookie officer.Blade is a silent hero for some reason here. The new sidekick, Jessica, is basically Jennifer from the Movie; bland. As a result of that, we see less of J.C. in Emergence. Elexis is still her same old self. Radek plays the sane man to Elexis' crazy wench, but otherwise he's just an unremarkable lackey. Fun fact: Jessica and Radek are voiced by the actors of Cortana and Sergeant Johnson from Halo, respectively.Unlike the original SiN, everything it did here is completely outclassed by Half-Life in every single aspect. It's nothing like the original game at all; it instead is a discount Half-Life 2 to be point of running the same engine as HL2 does, and only features 3 weapons and a pitiful cast of enemies. The ABO that was featured in the original SiN is gone. The level design is nothing remarkable and the sound design, apart from the voice acting, is pretty standard and reuses some from HL2 itself.It does, however, features a Dynamic Difficulty System. The goal of the system is to ensure no player will be stuck in the game or find it too easy. It works by constantly monitoring the player's actions, as well as its own decisions. Instead of altering the enemies health, damage, and speed like other games do, the game changes the difficulty in much more dynamic ways. For example, if the player scores headshots all the time, the next set of enemies you encounter will be equipped with helmets to protect them from headshots. If the player does not take much damage from combat, more enemies will appear and they will start using the weapons' alt-fire. Similarly, if the player is constantly low on health, killed enemies will drop medkits more often. On the other hand, if the player is still low on health all the time after that, the game will try something different to help you. While it sounds good on paper, in the end it doesn't even matter due to how short the game is.In the end, this game; together with its fellow, 'Half-Life 2: Episodes'; is proof that the episodic format will never work. Sure, you can say it allows the devs to reuse assets in future episodes so they can focus on creating new stuff as well as providing a steady flow of content from beginning till the end, but it's all pointless if they do not have the tenacity, fundings, or workforce to back it up.Overall, I'd give it a 6/10.

												So... took me a few years to finally finish this game as a part of my endless game backlog :) . I can definitely recommend this game to anyone who cares about ""old school"" FPS like HL2 and the like. The game has a few annoyances like imprecise controls, a sense of floaty movement (like on skates) and some other minor issues but overall it is good fun. Of course it's pretty short because it was just supposed to be the first episode out of many but for the few hours it lasts it is quite entertaining. Not great but decent enough to give it a shot. Nice run & gun gameplay. Overall I'd probably rate it a 7/10 with one extra point just for the awesome title track ""What's the world come to"" composed by Zak Belica and sung by Sarah Ravenscroft.

												Get a glimpse at what could've been! The failed attempt to continue the SiN franchise lives on in some kind of zombie limbo on Steam. Before the advent of digital distribution, this would've been the kind of game that would've showed up as a few screenshots in a magazine before quietly slipping beneath the waters only to resurface a decade later on eBay when some former employee of the company finds some old build burned on a DVD in a shoebox in storage somewhere and decides to try to cash in on the collector's market.Instead, we can play the first playable chunk (which is a reasonably polished and fun little bit of shooter) and get the entirety of the old first game all nice and legal-like. Worth the price if only because it's the kind of thing that normally nobody outside the company making it would ever get to see. All you nerds who go digging through torrent sites or eBay trying to find old builds of unreleased games so you can check 'em out, you should be all over this.			"

Weapons, enemies, levels everything resembles a well-known Valve creation. However, it does not make Sin Episodes: Emergence a bad game, because the combat is addicting and fun. But, it takes around 3-4 hours to beat what is a real shame, and I wish Elexis Sinclaire had more time on the screen. Overall my score is 7 out of 10, not so good but not terrible either.			"

												An FPS with slightly more strategy than the average shooter! Environmental slow-motion caused by shooting cannisters! Lots of hidden shootable health vials which are more efficient if placed in a dispenser! A shotgun with a richochet effect, useful in close quarters! Damage mutants with the same cannisters that heal you! (Can anybody actually name a good time when they did this effectively? I mean come on, you have to get a valuable health cannister and throw it at them, shoot it, and hope they stand still, and it also damages them *slowly*, er anyway..) Etc, etc.Too bad it didn't get further sequels made, as its a decent series. Damn it casual puzzle game developers, why did you have to buy these poor people D: It's also worth checking out the first game if you haven't yet.			"

												Sadly, you'll never get to see the ending to this story because the developer was bought up, and effectively squelched during the making of the following episode.So SiN Episodes: Emergence is effectively SiN 2, as a result. It's a shame because playing through this Source based sequel you'll find a lot of that fun actionsplotation you would have loved playing the original (Which comes with this game by the way which is why I recommend this). It's amped up now, and is a little less ""A to B shoot everything on the way"" but still has that  action star feel. Once again you're trying to track down a corrupt criminal CEO but now you've been poisoned. Play through this, and hope that someone competent secures the rights to finish this someday in our lifetime.			"

												A really fun first-person shooter, underappreciated by critics and not well known among FPS players. If you enjoyed Half-Life 2, you should try SiN Episodes as they share the spirit, the engine, and even some assets.			"

												After rushing 24 hours total with this. I´m done. I´ve played all the maps(story i mean), fanmade, Sin 1 Source maps, EVERYTHING. (those all i could find and download). I examined every place in all maps totally. So the fun would not end. Positive things about this game:-AI, so much better than in any other source game, enemies can get wounded, and can´t move, just noticed that in last map  i played, they kick things at you, shoots exploding barrels (and maybe kick them towards you after that), they can melee better, using head example, they throw your grenades back to you(i think, i´m not sure about this one) and they can get health from healthstations example. So it´s more challangening to fight them.-Maps, so much colours. I love it. They world its self is gorgeous.-Characters, Omg ur sidekick and main enemy *_*, characters are too very colourful and have great personalities. And other enemies etc. are funny as ♥♥♥♥. Mutants too are awsome. Like that hulk/tank, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥it´s terrifying, in a good way. And ohohhohooo holy♥♥♥♥♥♥i bursted to laugh with jetpack soldiers.-Arcade mode (it´s like survival but you need to surivive example: 15 mins of \""horde\""), damn, i had so much fun. I made two gameplay videos of those, Official and un-official map gameplays. Vertigo is best of them all. And fanmaps are awsome too.-Tiny bit of horror. That mutant part. I was terrifyed a bit. -Guns with specialists. Damn i had fun with those bouncing shotgun bullets, those were helpful in many ways. -HARDCORPS-mode, and that one, is hard. It is just like Outlast´s INSANE-mode. -Soundtrack, i love mostly the last boss fight song, games theme and it´s remix. One of the best themes in gaming universe.-Insane bunnyhopping-You can shoot trough the walls, obstacles etc. Like CSGO. AI is clever to do that too.-Many funny secrets and easter eggsNegative things about this game:-Movement, you move so ♥♥♥♥ing slow, and even sprint-jumping somewhere does not succeed very well sometimes.-Only 3 guns+melee+stupidly generated shotgun ironsight-Short game, it´s like 2 hours to 6 hours(if its new player playing)-Sometimes, AI´s melee is too OP-New game menu, like how do i know whatkind of difficulty i get while adjusting that difficulty. (see for urself and u know what i mean)-Dissapointing ending.-That tankhulk eats ur ammunition.-No multiplayer support. (like there is no multiplayer at all, and it would have been great with arcade maps, or/with survival style)-When you buy this, you will receive extra copy of Sin 1+Sin 1 MP, but Sin 1 is broken and multiplayer has no players and Sin 1 does NOT HAVE expansion pack (that is the real ending in that expansion.. buy this game for GOG if u want best version)-Blade is more silent in this one.. ;_;Now i want to say that this has been a great experience and i will not forget it. I will play this once again if this ever get revived. Last time i played this was 6 years ago and this was my second playthrough. And this game is 10 YEARS OLD NOW, has been for awhile. People has been in cliffhanger for 10 ♥♥♥♥ing years. Yes i know why. Don´t tell me then. I still hope they come back and revive this series ;_; we need EP2 ASAP.I highly recommend this for people who misses good old FPS style like HL2, CSS, COD(okay cod just came to my mind because that greanade throwing thingy and shooting through walls etc and meaning, time before EXO♥♥♥♥♥♥etc..) So this is perfect game for these kind of people, trust me, you will not be dissapointed.Overall rating 8/10			"

												I think this was maybe the 2nd game I ever got on steam besides HL2/CSS, back when games still came on DVD ROM (I know, right!?). Great promise at the time given it was a full single player adventure built in source, immiediately following in the footsteps of HL2, and is also the long-awaited sequel to a classic. I always appreciated the aesthetic in the original 'Sin' - it was stuck somewhere between Duke Nukem & Judge Dread, and was fairly tongue-in-cheek with a blunt sense of humour. That's all softened and modernized to a degree here, but otherwise it generally does all the things a fan of the original would want to see.  Still fun to smash through in 2017 (my playing of this game pre-dates steam's ability to track time played). If you like all things HL2 and Valve, whilst this isn't directly related to those titles, it is spiritually related, and is another testiment to a time when episodic games were apparently a really good plan until none of them got finished.

												The game is not all that mediocre about this game as they say.PROS (+)STORYThe story is well done at last is a series of SiN. The game takes place in an already known to us from the previous game, John Blade who was imprisoned by Elexis Sinclaire his main opponent and her new assistant, Victor Radek SiNTEK in life sciences. Suddenly there is an explosion and a helper saves us a new Jessica Cannon. Lab starts to burn after Radek and Elexis flee. After leaving the labolatories we grab Radek and destroy his evil plans.MUSICWhat a revelation to the music, the songs have a great listening sometimes even a little was left menu to listen to ""What's the world come to"" by Zak Bellic and Sarah Ravenscroft.GRAPHICSThe game runs on the familiar to us from Half-Life 2 Source engine and honestly the graphics look a little worse than in hl2 but it does the trick and is not bad :)PHYSICSAs for the physics that we see here is the same as in Half-Life 2, pick up objects, a perfect system of Ragdoll etc ...AIAs for the artificial intelligence of enemies and adversaries it looks a little different than in Half-Life which is better: the enemies of helping each other in need and throw various objects at us. As for the AI allies is the same as in Half-Life 2 which are immortal.CONS (-)LENGTH OF TRANSITION GAMEThe game lasts somewhere so for a maximum of three hours of fun, this is a wine that the game had come out in 9 episodes and walked only one.NUMBER OF WEAPONSThe game features only three types of weapons. These are:-Magnum Pistol (is there an alternative shoot)-Shotgun (Has bullets bouncing off the walls)-Assault Rifle (firing a bomb)+ GrenadesSUMMARY:If you love the game for 3-4 hours is recommended, when you buy you will get also free the first part of the game, if the game is too short for you, I would not recommend. I personally liked the game in terms of climate which is better than the HL :)8/10			"

Game seems to try to mimic Half Life, at certain moments it actually achieves a decent quality only to completely mess it up later on.Good elements:- gun play- some monster design- environmental puzzle- overall feelBad elements:- controls- platforming elements- trying to copy paste Half Life- extremely shortStill, for the few good elements it has it's actually worth checking out.

												A fun little quick ride of a game. The game itself is painfully short, a mere 5 hours. Researching I found the game was supposed to be part of a larger series but 5 hours for a full game is way to short. The game also shows many characteristics of other shooters in the era and has a stronge resemblence to Half-Life 2. You have a cutie girl follow you around multiple far off locations as you fight to defeat a big bad organization. Enemies are almost all human and toward the end of the game become increasingly strong in only how many bullets they can eat. Ammo is scarce and headshots are a must at many points. Interesting, the game ""adapts"" to your playing level, for example when you die in an area because there are too many enemies, when you return revived, there might be less, or they will be weaker. This is a nice feature to speed up play throughs but this is also somewhat insulting to players. Rather than this engine, it would have been nice if the player could just have been able to change diffultly ingame or betwen levels.Nevertheless, this game is a real challange with eneimes towards the end, forcing you to make use of enviromental object to clear room after room of eneimes. This can get tiring and is very unrewarding. I felt some relief after completing it because I would never have to stress about how to use barrels, gas leaks and grenades to kill soldiers for the 40th time again. However this Alyx-clone is superior to the original, she is much cuter and is much more genki. The game is acceptable.(7.5/10)			"

												Where do I begin???This game had one of the best engines (the Source engine), and one of the best story based action games from the late 90's, but somehow Ritual managed to commit the most evil crimes in Gaming history.You get the most awful selection of weapons, to take on Sintec's finest - wearing really tough armour, in the first (and only) Episodic rehash. With such a length from trailer to release, everyone was waiting for something big. Sadly the trailer was more fun.If your a fan of the franchise, I would seriously rethink this title. It has a few funny one liners, but that is all your money is worth.2/10			"

												A disappointing but still fun First-Person Shooter.What made Sin unique was its open world, highly interactive environment and the so-called Action Based Outcomes. For example, if you shoot down a billboard into the roof of a building below, it opens up a new entrance for the next level, otherwise, you'll have to shoot your way through the main entrance. Another example would be to turn a valve in one level, which floods an entire area in the next level, drowning a whole bunch of enemies.Unfortunately, Sin Episodes: Emergence is a poor attempt to be Half-Life 2: Episode 3, you follow a scripted linear path, kicking♥♥♥♥♥with your female sidekick. It's fun, but not very inspired.Additionally to the solo campaign, there is a survival mode, which is totally pointless since there's no leaderboards and you can't play in coop.The SDK includes the level editor Hammer, but there's no option to create a mod (and therefore no source code is available).Note that there won't ever be another Sin or Sin Episode. Also when you buy Sin Episodes: Emergence, you get the game Sin as well (except for buyers in Germany!). The steam version of Sin is censored (this include mainly nudity and drug references).			"

												If I had to pick a single word to describe this game, it would be: Underwhelming. The entirety of the game is generic and bland. Weapons and gunplay are boring and uninspired, character models are generic and recycled, levels are completely and utterly linear, and movement and aiming feel... strange. Honestly, the graphics aren't that bad, but the whole game just feels old. Like Half Life 1 old. Add to that the plot, which makes no sense to me, and spends entirely too much time without actually explaining anything, and the game comes across as utterly uncompelling. If you're a fan of the series, you may understand things better, and may consequently like the game more, but at this point I just have no interest in ever firing the game back up.			"

It's a short ride since Episode 2 and 3 (I think they were doing 3, not sure) are never going to be made due to the poor sales. Still, show your love for the devs and buy this game anyway.

Souce engine expression is never get old for me.Solid gunplay and adpative A.l. similar to HL2. Too bad there're just few weapons.Also, arena mode is really entertainment for people who love fast shooting.However, Ritual developers were owned by other comapny and there's no more episode come out.

												This review covers both SiN (which doesn't seem to be available from Steam any more) and SiN Episodes: Emergence. I have finished both games, but that was before ""the great reset of play time counters"" some years ago.SiN:An interesting game which had the misfortune of being released round about the same time as Half-Life. It also had the misfortune of being absolutely full of bugs which were only fixed with a huge (30Mb+) downloadable patch, at a time when most people only had dial-up connections. It had an interesting story, and very well designed levels, where actions performed in one map would affect those later on in the game. Many missions had several ways in which they could be solved. Well worth a play if you get the chance.SiN Episodes: Emergence:The first game I ever played which used the Source engine that wasn't made by Valve. Excellent graphics and sound, wonderful level design and pretty good AI. Brilliant, but unfortunately the creators sold the company to people who seem only interested in shoveling casual games on people, so we'll probably never see a sequel. Shame. It's not terribly original and you'll finish it in about three hours, but it is a lot of fun.			"

												It's a damn shame this series of games was never completed. SiN was a classic from my childhood, and although it hasn't aged too gracefully (that said, neither has Quake II, Unreal, or Half-Life), it holds a fond spot in my heart. I never played SiN Episodes: Emergence, since I hadn't heard anything about it when it was released, and afterwards, I only heard bad things about it. Frankly, I don't understand why this series receives so little attention, and so much negativity. SiN Episodes: Emergence has a splendid soundtrack, a very immersive set of environments, arguably better gameplay than most games from its era (Half-Life 2, Call of Duty 2, etc.), competent AI (appropriate use of cover, grenades, flanking, etc.) and a story I'd love to see completed. Sadly, I cannot say I recommend this series. Not because the games are bad, but because neither of them really have a place in the modern world. SiN has such a steep difficulty curve that it will put off most modern gamers and SiN Episodes: Emergence is merely an introductory chapter to what was supposed to be a game series comprised of nine episodes.It's a damn shame this series of games was never completed.

												Got this on release. I actually had to redownload and ""play"" the game for five minutes to review because back then they didn't track time played on Steam.It's a really solid game. The music is good and the Personal Challenge System that makes the game harder to match the player skill is a really cool idea and works well (on release there was a bug that would cause the game to become harder and harder which is hilarious but that was patched sometime in 2006). However, it turned out it didn't sell well enough to get any sequels. ripVerdict: Don't buy it unless it's like a dollar because it's part one of a series that will never be completed. If it's really cheap or you REALLY like the original SiN then it's worth getting I guess.			"

Posted: November 2, 2014
												This game is a SIN. There I said it. 6/17/16 Watch out as there are a lot of joke reviews on the Store page here treating this like Cory in the House. Buckle up this is a long ride.What's the world come to? Where episodic games on the Source Engine go the way of the gun. The game is not very good what with the poor level design and boring visuals. It's a sin that there's so little content across the board BLADE! (That and the game has super awkward (unsexy) female designs that objectify them in the worst most pre teen way possible.) I'm no prude, femenist, SJW or pathetic cuck but when a game gives you the opposite of a boner you know something is wrong as you groan and look over your shoulder to see if anyone has somehow been watching you silently, judging you the whole time as they shake their head reminding you that you should call your family and say you love them as you stare this♥♥♥♥♥♥game in the face. The character models could give Fallout 3 a run for it's money as these are the worst character models I've seen in a Source engine game since Contagion.Obviously the creators of an engine know how best to use it but it's shocking that a game can look this BAD on the Source engine a whole two years after Half-Life 2 was released. Many other devs at the time put it to good use and recent titles like Titanfall (Didn't play it) showed the Source engine may still have some life in it yet. The people are wayyyy smaller than doors and all the original art assets (Non recycled HL2 props.) look too large or cartoony to match the world around them which already looks horrible. There's no cohesion. Hell the HUD looks like something that would appear on an ugly,outdated,out of touch Kindergarten website. I think it uses some font that's like comic sans too. The character designs are inconsistant,uninspired,dull and basically look like the one artist on staff gave up and put whatever he could on the screen to get paid and go home (I feel his pain). The story and voice acting is also awful which helps make and add to the ""♥♥♥♥♥♥WE GOTTA SHIP SOMETHING GRAB THE INTERN"" feel that the game may have been going for. Worse yet is it's AI which is so badly bugged to hell even after a suppossed patch (Did they not even shoot their guns before?) that it should get a world record or something.The grunts (I don't remeber their names which is funny because they certainly know yours BLADE.) are probably the dumbest AI I ever have and ever will see. They often kill their own men and blow them selves up when they aren't piling up in front of  a door ,facing the wrong way,failing to use cover,getting stuck or literally jumping on top of massive piles of their own men killing themselves in the process. YES I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not they will get stuck on the massive piles of corpses that stack up when you camp or find certain spots that:(A) Spawn them (B) Respawn them or (C) Infinitley respawn them. Better yet sometimes after you shoot them or they shoot you they will instantly forget that they have ever seen you actually saying things like ""Damn it I know he's here somewhere!"".But wait, THERES MORE! While they are ""smart"" enough to use hand gestures to coordinate with their team they aren't smart enough to know how or when the right time to use them is. They often will get killed because instead of shooting you they start waving. Sometimes they will send waves of themselves to their doom by asking other grunts to use steps or to walk twoards piles of explosives that they themselves will shoot and be killed by. Oh and you see that screenshot of a soldier behind cardboard boxes on the store page? That poor ♥♥♥♥er is stuck. Most of the time unless you are forced to kill everyone to progress you can just walk past the enemies as they say something unintentionally hilarious like ""You'll never get past me BLADE!"" before setting themselves on fire in the background. Hell you could probably run though most of the game as they have such bad aim that they'll make Stormtroopers look like Quiet. The final thing I noticed was that sometimes the AI will ♥♥♥♥ up so badly that you'll enter a room after a quick save just to find they've saved you the trouble of shooting them by killing themselves in some sort of amazing manor leaving you awestruck as you try to figure out how they killed themselves this time.The plot and characters are also awful and forgetable with the voice acting approaching but not quite reaching Resident Evil levels of bad. The only reason you'll remember who your playing as is thanks to the grunts shouting your name at you the one and only Blade. The dumb grunts are the most memorable thing in the game in fact as their unintentional stupidity has stuck with me even after all this time. I remember one enemy stuck in the ceiling with a jetpack. Another walked away slowly his back turned to me as I killed everyone around him. One said ""Nice try Blade!"" before getting killed by his teamate who promptly got stuck on a door. One man stared at me without shooting and did nothing even when I shot at him. The smartest thing I saw someone do was take cover behind a pipe and try to shoot me. But alas he could only hit the wall and I walked behind  him and watched as he got out of cover and shot the wall at the end of the hall while ignoring me. EVEN the mutants (Spoilers I guess.) get stuck on small bumps I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not. Even though many are the height of the player when crouching they absolutley CANNOT walk and or fit through the pipes and other small areas that they are DEFINITLEY intended to. Hell, they are smaller than the player how do they not fit under large crouchable pipes?When you tally up all of it's problems it's almost so embarrassing that if for no other reason it may be worth a picking up for a laugh if nothing else interesting is steeply discounted. It's extremely short as I beat it in 2 hours my first time through on the highest difficulty. It will be remembered as that game you didn't own that breifly had a check box in Garrys Mod 9, having a surprisingly kick♥♥♥♥♥main theme and for bankrupting it's developer which is actually kind of sad though considering that games quality not unexpected. This is game is the Yang to Half-Life 2's Yin and this review is the longest I've ever done. 10 bucks can get you way better games on Steam like DooM as an example which is a far better shooter than SiN Episodes: Emergence. If you want a second opinion check out Gggmanlives review. This games Metacritic score is a joke.			"

												Sin Emergence is a little known sequel to the little known Quake clone SiN. It has generic characters, gameplay and was actually planned out to be a series of 9 episodes. When the first didn't sell well they canned the whole project.In general Emergence reminds me a lot of early Source engine games like Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines, Dark Messiah etc. In that they are fairly easy to run today but don't look all that inspiring. SiN plays like a Quake-esque mod for Half Life 2, which was one of my first thoughts playing it.The one redeeming quality about this game was it's much hyped ""Arena"" mode. Which was superficially based on Max Payne 2's Dead Man Walking mode. In it, you run around surviving against endless waves of enemies whilst the difficulty dynamically shifts depending on how well your doing. Ala, Godhand. However there's only a handful of maps available, most of which are garbage.I bought this game for less then 4$ on a Steam sale and it's probably worth that much honestly. It's not too impressive and doesn't capture the appeal of the Source engine.			"

One school day, a boy named Tom was sitting in class and doing math. It was six more minutes until after school. As he was doing his homework, something caught his eye.His desk was next to the window, and he turned and looked to the grass outside. It looked like a picture. When school was over, he ran to the spot where he saw it. He ran fast so that no one else could grab it.He picked it up and smiled. It had a picture of the most beautiful girl he had ever seen. She had a dress with tights on and red shoes, and her hand was formed into a peace sign.She was so beautiful he wanted to meet her, so he ran all over the school and asked everyone if they knew her or have ever seen her before. But everyone he asked said ""No."" He was devastated.When he was home, he asked his older sister if she knew the girl, but unfortunately she also said ""No."" It was very late, so Tom walked up the stairs, placed the picture on his bedside table and went to sleep.In the middle of the night Tom was awakened by a tap on his window. It was like a nail tapping. He got scared. After the tapping he heard a giggle. He saw a shadow near his window, so he got out of his bed, walked toward his window, opened it up and followed the giggling. By the time he reached it, it was gone.The next day again he asked his neighbors if they knew her. Everybody said, ""Sorry, no."" When his mother came home he even asked her if she knew her. She said ""No."" He went to his room, placed the picture on his desk and fell asleep.Once again he was awakened by a tapping. He took the picture and followed the giggling. He walked across the road, when suddenly he got hit by a car. He was dead with the picture in his hand.The driver got out of the car and tried to help him, but it was too late. Suddenly he saw the picture and picked it up.He saw a cute girl holding up three fingers. "

The storyline and settings were varied and kept you on your toes.The downside is that it's short, this was supposed to be the first part in a episodic content release, that... unfortunately never got the attention/support it richly deserved. So without spoilers, it will leave you wanting for more.

												Although it can occasionally feel like Half-Life 2 Lite, SiN Episode: Emergence is an intriguing, above-average shooter. Such a pity that Ritual's acquisition by MumboJumbo quickly hammered nails into the game's coffin. Another failure for the much lauded ""episodic gaming"" fad. (Which is kinda ironic, when you consider how something like the Assassin's Creed series perfectly embodies what publishers were hoping to do with the phenomenon, although in that particular case we ended up paying 60 bucks per episode, and perhaps a bit more once you throw the DLC on top.)

												What Duke Nukem should have been, an FPS. A couple of rail segments and you're into the shooting in 3-4 minutes. Nicely envisioned world, good voice work, jetpack enemies, fun, but way too short and this first installment is also the last. A real shame. If only Gearbox had picked this up instead.			"

A lot of the guys will start to wear helmets. Like hitting the body? More armour for those baddies. It is pretty cool. Plus the game keeps tons of stats. Glorious, glorious stats.			"

												Before playing SiN Episodes: Emergance, I would highly recommend playing the Original SiN to gain backstory on the events unfolding. I highly recommend this game due to its gripping action, interesting charactrers, well put game design, great voice acting (which some of you may recognize), and the very simple, yet deadly weapons to choose from. However the cons to this sequal are: Lack of voice acting of Blade (the main hero), and interactive elements that were from the original game, such as: Computers, Panels.  Other cons: Lack of Dark Environments from the original SiN, Electrka looks god damn gorgous but her face looks way different compared to SiN. Other than that, Grab both games and have an old school pass through memory lane. And by the way...........""I'm gunna make you my ♥♥♥♥♥!""			"

												(THIS IS FOR THE FIRST SIN GAME AND NOT EMERGENCE)Still one of my favorite games of all time. SiN remains my favorite FPS ever created due to its interactivity, visuals, style, storyline and pure variety and fast paced fun to the gameplay. Sadly overshadowed by its competitor Half-Life even though SiN had done leaps and bounds more than the original Half-Life ever did. SiN kept the old school massive non-linear fast paced style of games such as Quake, Duke Nukem 3D, Blood and a bunch of other examples of the glory days of the fps. But while keeping that old school style it brought in innovations such as vehicles, intelligent AI that could call for backup or run for cover, location based damage modeling, destructible environments, dynamic music, location based armour, and a whole slew of other achievements. Compared to Half-Life the location variety, soundtrack and overall gameplay is leaps and bounds above it. It gives me a much more fast paced, fun, varied and non-linear experience. While Half-Life gave you a research facility, a desert and... a research facility. SiN gives you a bank, a factory, an underwater plant, a warehouse, an office building, a construction site, apartment buildings, mines and an assortment of other locations that I can't bring off the top of my head. While Half-Life gave you slow tromps through a linear environment, SiN gave you large open levels with tonnes of hidden areas, secondary objectives and an incentive to explore for weapons, armour and ammo. While Half-LIfe gave you limited interactivity, SiN gave you interactivity to the level of Duke3D with interactive computers used with DOS promps, destructible environments, secondary objectives or items that could drastically change future levels, along with an assortment of others.Overall SiN shall forever remain one of my favorite FPS games of all time, it's a shame that it was ignored due to the release of Half-Life and the slew of bugs that plauged it until the first patch. Rest in peace Ritual Entertainment, killed by the industry and being bought out by a casual company.			"

												I am truly agrieved that Ritual Entertainment went under not long after the release of this title, as it made a very strong start to what I feel would have been a fun series of games. I don't even remember how I came to be in posession of Emergence, but I sense I bought it because it included the first Sin game, a singleplayer FPS based on the Half-Life engine that I did not have the opportunity to play when it first released. While Sin was a good game in it's own right, I feel like Emergence more fully realized the vision of the game's setting- A gung-ho paramiltiary police force battling the agents of a genetic research firm gone mad. Besides, how many games have a black protagonist that isn't a racial caracature?			"

												Honestly, this is kinda a wasted potential. I grew up playing the old game, which I loved, so I had high hopes for this new installment. Sadly, the game lacks a bit of originality gameplay wise, as it copies Half-Life's source engine, it just feels like it's a copy and paste job, just different skin. And since developers wanted this to be in episodes, the game ends before if even started.Still, the game works, and it features some interesting characters, design wise if nothing else. Sin still has one of the most hottest female villains around, Elexis, now modeled after adult model Bianca Beauchamp. All in all if you aren't expecting much and want an oldie shooter, there is some fun to be have here.			"

												I had bought this at a Circuit City because I was bored and was curious about this whole 'SIN' thing. I didn't enjoy the demo of the original game much, but I was thinking more modern FPS design would help fix it! And I was pleasantly surprised. This is a leaner, shorter version of SIN without all the tedious level design (well, significantly less tedious anyway.) The scripted sequences are nice and it is fun to shoot the dudes in the head with your pistol. It's not much and it lasts about four hours, plus you're never going to ever get a sequel with this. Given all that, though, the work they must have put into this game and their subsequent closing down was the bellwether for the failure of the episodic model - too much work for too little payoff (and profit). Still, it's worth a playthrough.			"

												Although it can occasionally feel like Half-Life 2 Lite, SiN Episode: Emergence is an intriguing, above-average shooter. Such a pity that Ritual's acquisition by MumboJumbo quickly hammered nails into the game's coffin. Another failure for the much lauded ""episodic gaming"" fad. (Which is kinda ironic, when you consider how something like the Assassin's Creed series perfectly embodies what publishers were hoping to do with the phenomenon, although in that particular case we ended up paying 60 bucks per episode, and perhaps a bit more once you throw the DLC on top.)

												This sequel sees the return of the two main characters from SiN: Elexis's breasts. Also you are playing as Blade again but as you never see him in this game and there is not as much cool banter with JC  it is easy to forget this. The levels are more linear than SiN with lots of locked doors but all the problems of SiN are gone from this game. It feels very much like Half Life 2 and this is no bad thing, the world looks very nice and you can interact with lots of things. Overall this is a very nice shooter with one massive flaw. It is called SiN episodes but there is only one episode. The game almost feels like a prologue to the rest of the game that was never released. For the price it is still very much worth buying.			"

												Pretty decent game. It's good. If you have some extra money and it's on sale, I recommend buying it, but don't buy it for 10 bucks. It's not worth it. It's mostly just a Half life copy wich is targeted for adults			"

												Good to kill a bit of time, fairly boring fighting mainly the same enemies especially towards the end. Alot like Half Life in gameplay but not upto standard story or design wise. Could have been alot better but worth a look if your in the mood for a HL style shooter.			"

												I honestly loved this game, it was old school shooter, with good cyberpunk, mixed with plenty of attitude and great (for the time) graphics, it had a really good supporting cast, and a really boss nemesis! The storyline and settings were varied and kept you on your toes.The downside is that it's short, this was supposed to be the first part in a episodic content release, that... unfortunately never got the attention/support it richly deserved. So without spoilers, it will leave you wanting for more. But then any more, I'd rather something leave on a high note, and with a bang, which SiN Episodes: Emergency absolutely does!Definitely worth the price of admission at it's full price!			"

												Heard some not so positive reviews on this but I decided to pick it up on a cheap sale anyways. It plays a lot like Half-Life 2, maybe not much of a coinsidence since it came out around the same time. I guess I must think that's a good thing as I really enjoyed most of the game. Some of the later city level parts aren't quite as good as the earlier ones, but overall I feel it's a solid experience if you can find it at a low price.			"
