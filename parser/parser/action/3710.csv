												Drokking fantastic. That classic Dredd humor with some surprisingly decent shooting. Arresting perps is satisfying beyond belief. Unlawful posession of a hamster? It's the cubes for you, criminal scum. A cool primary weapon with all of the weapon modes from the comics and some great cutscenes with Dredd being badass as usual. If you want an old-school shooter with great humor and a wacky story-line, this can't be beat. Especially for a $1.34.			"

												If I went by the reviews I'd not have gotten this game nor wasted any time playing it.  I got it on a Steam sale and it is worth full price.Sure there are flaws, acknowledged.    One of the levels stopped giving me hints and I got stuck.  Exiting the game and reloading (not reinstalling) it brought back that levels hints so I could proceed. BTW that particular map was a little different that it required some thought to figure out how to defeat the judge.But the game is FUN, not frustrating and I kept going even after sometimes dying a lot.THIS not the average shooter where the whole world is a free fire zone;  where any sighted  sprite or actor, is likely hostile, and you shoot it.In DREDD, indiscriminate killing  has bad consequences.  There are citizens that may appear suddenly in your face and , after years of computerized  ""shooter training;"" instinct is full-auto to THEIR face.  OOPs, reload save.  Even while blasting identified bad guys, one has to be careful of citizens, allied judges or the surrendered nearby.   --some actors are your allied judges.--some actors are criminal scum but can be disarmed / arrested (for me more satisfying than head splats)--the arrested /surrendered criminal scum are helpless and you have the moral obligation to avoid having them killed by errant gunfire; most likely coming from your own barrels.--some actors are citizens and you do not want to see them harmed, and in many cases you are trying to rescue them.--you can ambush criminal scum to gain a tactical advantage, but it counts against you.--you can challenge criminal scum and lose tactical advantage, though some will surrender; giving you the opportunity for that oh so satisfying arrest lingo ie ""YOU JUST EARNED YOURSELF xxxxx Time IN THE CUBES.""  And there is a level where you VISIT these cubes.   Jump off a catwalk on a container then into the iso cube, if curious.  A bunk, a toilet and print across the wall, CRIME DOES NOT PAY.  Unlike Fallout 3, your pockets are not deep.  You can only have two weapons which requires some decisions.   Firefights may use up your ammo of your preferred Judge Gun; and that's another thing, setting  criminal scum on fire with the incendiary round is inadvisable.  You overreaching cop, you. There are plenty of vampires and zombies to try it out on.   Your Judge Gun has all kinds of ammo types which replace gun variety in other games.  There is even some kind of grenade (I have yet to use).  Some levels you can go through Judge Gun ammo quick and there are other found weapons to try.  Once ammo is used up, these found weapons can get you through the level. Depending, although, on how things go, you may be trading them out for different found guns.  The grenade launcher may not be the best choice as blowback bites.   To save ammo, some adversaries can be tackled in melee mode with little risk.  Yes, health can run quite low and it may  require several save reloads to get through a level. The voice acting is hilarious, reminding me of Duke Nukem 3d, arresting a perp yields ""tough cop"" howlers such as  ""throwing away the key,"" or ""there's an iso cube with your name on it."" or ""you're taking the big ride;""  to name a few.  Tone quite close to the 2012  movie Dredd. Let's just forget about that Stallone attempt.  I think even Stallone wants to forget.The bizarre fashion world of Judge Dredd  can take some getting used to. For example, there are  numerous fatties with bellywheels to help prop their enormous bulk.   Apparently though, they are not an aberration as one might expect to see in a singularly unique character;  but a conscious citizen  lifestyle.  Wikipedia explained them  as ""Bored citizens who have turned to gluttony as a means to pass the time.""  Views  from rooftops and other outside areas can be breathtaking. Mega City One looms in the background, an architectural metropolis.  The skyline is packed with elaborate skyscrapers and futuristic aircraft ply the skies.  For a few minutes at least, I would take in that scenery marveling at its artistic skill.  I like to take a look around at the aesthetics of the environment and not just blow through the level.  There is a nightclub that had some interesting decor, for example.I'm playing this on an IMAC 27""  WIn8.1, bootcamp with an old USB Logitech gamepad not updated past WinXP  but it works fine on 8.1.  Like all other games,  I just have to re-import the profile after computer reboots and insure the profile is set to persistent (no there is no option to install the gamepad outside the program fldr).I'm sorry this game was not more popular, it has a lot of good things in it I'd like to see in other games; you do not have to kill the entire world to win.9/110A good look at what the game is about if you are still reluctant to give up the cheeseburger cash:http://superadventuresingaming.blogspot.com/2012/01/judge-dredd-dredd-vs-death-pc.html "

												First off, let me get this out of the way : This game is objectively bad, but the following is why I think you should pick it up anyways.This game is an arcade shooter where the campaign is a means to unlock the more challenging ones. This game is based on the comic book dystopian future of Judge Dredd, where you play as the franchise' namesake Joseph Dredd. In this game's camaign, you fight through levels where you have to not only take down crooks by shooting their guns off or injuring them a bit before arresting them, you also have the dark Judges to contend with, as well as vampires. Exact plot details are lost on me as it gets really stupid. The game shows signs of brilliance and potential to be a great comic book video game franchise like the Batman Arkham series, but Rebellion ran out of money, and what we are left with is a 3 hour campaign that is pretty unpolished and unoptimized, even on more modern systems. And that's where a lot of the problems with this game come from, lack of budget and time. It doesn't have any great widescreen or FoV options, the enemy AI can sometimes glitch out and do stupid things. As such, I can understand how many could be put off by this game.On the other hand, this is a budget shooter that costs less than a Cheeseburger combo at McDonalds. Not only that, there are plenty of arcade style challenges that are unlocked when playing through the campaign, and they are actually quite fun. For a budget shooter, this one has a surprising amount to offer in terms of replayability. Not to mention, Rebellion did put in the effort to try to make it feel like a Judge Dredd game. If you are bored and are looking for something quick and inexpensive to chew through, you can definitely do worse than this game. If you are a fan of the series looking for something extra to add to your collected curios, this should at least amuse you.			"

												Recommended with reservation.It's short. Six hours max.The graphics are ancient. They are a bit too colourful in places.Sometimes enemies fly off when you kill them.Rescuing hostages in the hospital is a bit maze-like.However being a childhood Dredd reader I liked it when I played it years ago. Out of curiosity of forgetting what it was like I just bought it again in the Black Friday sale (2014). I had a blast. It's gun and run and flows fast. There is still the odd surprise. It's a shame it will probably never be re-made and improved and lengthened. Given its short length I can understand why it was panned in reviews years ago. Being a fan I can understand why I liked it.High-ex.			"

												The prosThe story keeps close to the comics delightfully. Your Dread quips are terribly enjoyable (just keep hitting e). Arresting people is fun, the list of charges is amusing. The gameplay is smooth. It's easy to play. If you've ever played a quake game this will come easy to you. Navigation is simple. And the guns are satisfying.The consThe visuals are dated. It's a overly bright skin wrap effect at times. Which is ignorable mostly. My main gripe is the scacity of goodie drops. Ammo isn't hard to comeby, but good luck getting a health drop.I haven't tried multiplayer yet, but I'm looking forward to it.But for a Judge Dread style shootfest and a good laugh. Even the shortness of the main story can be ignored. It's nicely intense. A good buy!			"

												It's so bad it loops around and becomes a masterpiece.I punched everyone during the tutorial, and they sent a killsquad after me. I hid behind the plexiglass in the jump and crouch course, and they couldn't pathfind around it, but there was a hole big enough for me to punch through. I punched a guys shin until he died and took his gun, then shot the guns out of the hands of all the kill squad members and stole them, leaving them unarmed. After that I shot them in the knees and watched them play the ridiculous limb crippled animation over and over until they died from a broken knee.  "

												A violent FPS based on the famous comic book series from 2000 AD.The production value is somewhat poor. The graphics look very dated, the animations are jerky, the AI is stupid, the vampire and undead enemies are poorly coded and animated, the level design sometimes feels very obtuse, and there's a plethora of weird bugs.However, if you're a fan of the comic book, there's certainly fun to be had here. Rebellion nailed perfectly Judge Dredd's unique sense of humour and the rendition of Mega-City One is spot on. It's violent, gore, stupid, hilarious at times, and pure mindless fun.The headshots are awesome (instant bloody decapitation!). You can immolate people. Kill by ricochet. Fire homing bullets. And even reliably disarm perps by shooting their weapons off their hands, allowing you to arrest them, instead of killing them. You can also kill your allies and civilians. It's funny that you can abuse of your authority to arrest innocent civilians, while listening to their complaints make it all the more hilarious.Aside from the solo/coop campaign, there's a survival mode and many LAN multiplayer modes (you can replace humans with bots too). The multiplayer games, being fast and violent, can be very fun to play with a group of friends.			"

												Bought this game on PC for the nostalgia from my PS2 days, great decision. Despite its incredibly aged graphics, the fast paced gameplay stands up to the likes of Doom and and other arcade shooters, with the gore to go along with it (decapitations and gallons of blood galore). The storyline is good, leading the player to action around pretty much every corner. But the best part is that you can arrest fat people for obstruction. Seriously, buy it.			"

												Sardonic and quirky humor, simple - almost stupid story arc, naked vampires covered in blood that are in very good shape, zombies that are very much out of shape, and obese people; all there to arrest or kill at your leisure. A very relaxing five to seven hours I must say. The colorfull, out of date graphics add to the pleasing nature of this arcade shooter; would it be more appropriate for this to have terribly detailed next gen graphics? No, it would lack the cartoonish charm. The game is aging very well.			"

												Admittedly this game hasn't aged brilliantly... That being said it is a lot of fun to play, the shooting mechanics are solid and you are a non Dredd fan you might as well pick it up during a sale. also the low price makes it a perfect way to treat your friends at christmas without going out of pocket or resorting to buying bad rats. Now as a Judge Dredd fan I can say that in my opinion the Dredd universe is faithfuly represented, the storyline covers Dredd's general duties for example foiling bank robberies, arresting perps for low level crimes and generally applying the law to the means streets of Mega-City-1. The storyline also covers the more radical elements of Dredd's universe, the dark Judges escaping for example; this is the main plot point, hence the name Dredd Vs Death. Other threats Dredd will have to tackle are zombie and vampire infestations, dark cultists and the mad scientist Dr Icarus. If you are a fan of the comics you will likely notice many references to them in the game. The other part of the game aside from the main Dredd focused storyline is arcade mode, this pits the player in a challenge map pitted against infinitely respawning enemies usually with a time limit or number of kills that have to be reached as the win condition, although these aren't as fun as the main storyline they lightly reference the comics, such as playing as DeMarco P.I in one map. Overall I would say buy it if it's a sale and you want something to give your friends which is inexpensive, fun to play and most importantly, not bad rats. On a side note this is probably the most faithful recreation of the Dredd universe in video game.			"

More than 10 years old this game still brings loads of fun and still better than the new Judge Dredd movie!+Visuals - with a maximum resolution of 1280x1024, still this game looks really cool, most likely the dark palette. Funny ragdoll models, various enemies, everything looks nice (except 2D guns on the ground XD ).Freaky FOV doesn't make this game worse, you'll get used to it. +Soundwork - amazing sound work, all the character well voiced, a lot of funny jokes, and Judge Dredd himself have nice voice (And face XD )+Gameplay: Great campaign - 10 missions + 10 additional arcade maps with various missions. Even had multiplayer (but game spy arcade is dead), legendary Judge Pistol with various bullets, and ofcourse - arrest everyone for everything - too fat - get half a year, farting in public - jailed forever. Don't shoot innocent people, just Judge them and jail for life!+Works properly on the modern PCs! Even looks nice with low res.

												Judge Dredd vs Death is a first person shooter that gives me a huge nostalgic buzz when playing, this game was originally on the Sony Playstation 2 and I used to play this when I was a kid and had a blast!The PC version of this game really does show how dated this game actually is however with the poor graphical quality (Not even that good for the time it was made) it still looks passable and the unique Dredd dystopian aesthetic with the character assets and environments is somewhat pleasing still.I did encounter a few problems with this port; the resolutions are really funky and do not scale well with any display and gives weird resolutions like 2047 x 1894 which was odd, you also get the occasional flickering but I guess this is expected to come with a dated game. You do get AA options and AF options to increase the fidelty to polish away the jaggys.Is the game fun? YES, if you enjoy dumb shooters with quirky mechanics and hilarious at times early day ragdoll physics this game is for you, the npc's give off hilarious dialogue as you arrest them for stupid things such as 'Possession of a goldfish without a license'. There is also co op mode (Not sure about online functionality however split screen works.), and an arcade mode (Not sure about online functionality also) as well as a challenge mode which allows you to unlock cool cheat codes for the main story. As of the time of this review this game is on sale for £1.24 and I think it's pretty fun for an old solid fps with 3-4 hours (Not counting other modes) of classic gameplay. Just don't go into this expecting a triple A masterpiece, it's far from it.Edit: Split Screen apparently is non existant. Arcade mode is the challenge mode, and I think 'Battle' is the arcade mode with bots or multiplayer.			"

												This game was a neat blast from the past.  It'd be difficult to argue that it's objectively great from any perspective, but my history with first-person shooters led me to have a good time.  However, playing the game is this odd mix of attempting to arrest as many lawbreakers as you can while not taking damage.  There are rules that a new player must parse out, such as which enemies to kill first to make others surrender, or if it is possible to make certain enemies surrender.  Obviously, you could play the game in a ""scorched earth"" capacity and murder everyone, but that's a bit dissonant with the theme.  I enjoyed the future world, Dredd's voice acting, and the incredibly obese citizens that wheel around their bellies. I AM THE LAW!			"

												This is probably the best single-player first person shooter since Painkiller or Brutal Doom, and my favorite multiplayer tied with TF2 and Quake III. It's a silly, bloody, run and gun brainblasting shoot 'em up on one hand, a chuckle-bringing satire on police brutality on the other hand, and a seamless adaptation of the Dredd series from comic to FPS on some weird third genetic defect hand. It reminds me of the Soldier of Fortune series with it's PS2 graphical standard and excessive bloodshed, but it's also a polished and fun shooter with originality and fun-factor to spare. I love it. There's much more I could say, but I just love it. It's dirt cheap, too. Buy it. Now.                                    This game is perfect, but in it's own flawed way.                                                                                             Charm out the wazoo.                            Buy it, then friend me and we can 1v1. It'll be fun.			"

												Judge Dredd: Dredd vs Death is not based on the movie but on the cartoon series. I must admit I'm not familiar with the cartoon but a First Person Shooter in a Sci-Fi Universe (cyberpunk) is always right in my book. The game launched in 2005 and even back then the graphics were pretty bad, just compare this game to Quake 4 or FEAR.... I didn't mind the graphics much but it's obvious why this game didn't do well in the ratings. The story is not that great either just the 'things go to hell, kill bad guy' type of story. Gameplay is just what you would expect from an old FPS and the A.I. is not very good. Perhaps the game is not that great but I'm still going to recommend it, simply because I had a good time playing it and I loved the cyberpunk theme and atmosphere. This game is not for everyone so I only recommend it to FPS fans who don't mind bad graphics and love sci-fi.  "

												game from 2003 feels like dumbed down half life 1 meets duke nukem. story is fun, very basic but it gets the job done, cutscenes have dredd look like grumpy cat.  very basic exploration leads to more ammo and health items. you can get 'lost' and wonder around for a bit because you havent fully completed an objective (aka 1 gangmember to arrest somewhere) a map or objective checklist would have been nice to have. melee feels way to slow to be effective whilst all the enemies are in your face, this game is often as dark as doom 3 was, only you dont get a flashlight in this game. shotgun is only useful at close range but anything 'smarter' than a zombie is going to be a pain to get near and shoot fast enough with 1 shot every 4 seconds or so...if you walk into a new area enemies spawn left and right, see a corner you cant direcly see into? enemy... pathfinding AI is downright terrible, both civis you have to save often get stuck on nothing or doorways only to get flagged with a waypoint. shooting them sorts that at cost of your 'judge rating' boo hoo. enemies both gangmembers and zombies can run around to the benny hill theme, cant look up if youre just 1 floor up and make for easy pickingthe waypoints you get can be a PAIN to deal with, see that last enemy vampire thats jumping around you trying to claw you to death? yes lets give him a waypoint starting at his hips covering everything up. forget getting a headshot once the last enemy is 'waypointed' spray and praybecause its an old game it supports resolution up to 1600x1200i got 3-4 hours of gameplay out of the single player and it has an online feature that i didnt checkoutgiving credit where its due, the game does have a ton of funny jokes and wise cracks you get to run around and shoot stuff and in that the game does it  decently... bought it on sale and would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun simple fps dipped in dredd sauceit was a budget game when it came out and it aged as such			"

Intro & SummaryJudge Dredd: Dredd vs Death is like one of those B movies that's really bad and ugly, but intelligent and funny enough that it becomes a real masterpiece and great fun. It was also released back in the era of games like Postal and Carmageddon in a time when being unique was prized, and being crude and over the top wasn't a bad thing, so long as the gameplay was fun.Highlights* Great humour and satire, really tasteless and crude but smart, and funny* Fast pace, there's always action, or something funny happeningMistakesThe majority of this games problems come from it's total lack of budget and polishing, presumably due to rushing to meet deadlines. While the problems somewhat add to the appeal, and help make the price great value, they keep this from being a great FPS.* Probably too short. The price makes up for this, but it can still leave you hanging* Dated graphics and a lack of settings (FOV, etc) can cause problemsRecommendationsFor just £5.59/7.99€/$7.99 this is a very fair buy, albeit for a short playtime of just 4-5 hours. A great multiplayer and tons of characters also lend towards the good replay value. If this is on sale, pick it up. If it isn't, it's probably worth sticking on the wishlist if you have a sense of humour. "

												If you're wondering whether this is a faithful adaptation of the source material, the answer is a resounding Yes. You get to wield Dredd's famous Lawgiver gun (complete with six modes of fire) and the control scheme includes a ""You're under arrest!"" key that gives your enemies a chance to surrender. The game awards you for doing Judge-like things such as arresting criminals and rescuing civilians while you blast your way across Mega-City One.The campaign isn't all that long, but completing it does unlock lots of side challenges, which in turn also unlock additional content for the multiplayer modes, which include your standard Deathmatch variations (and yes, they have bots) as well as a Dredd-inspired ""Judges Vs. Perps"" gametype.The campaign had a few frustrating parts, sure, and the jump physics feel a bit floaty, and the reloading animations seem to go in slow motion, but despite being rough around the edges, I felt that it delivered on its promise of making you feel like Judge Joseph Dredd himself, almost to the point of shouting ""I AM THE LAW!"" at your screen.

												""I am the law""TL; DR : If you are a big fan of the 2000 AD comics or liked both Bredd movies, then buy when there's a discount.DreddvDeath is a FPS game by Rebellion where you battle against Judge Death, who has escaped again from imprisonment and is still trying to complete his goal. Yeah, the plot is that simple. It's a decent game that gets dredd right but it forgot how to be fun! The problem with this game is that it lacks fun, it has its moments, but most of the time you ll feel lost in barren levels. I expected a heavier emphasis on action but I got sorely disappointed.The controls are okay, they are solid and responsive BUT, there are some commands that are totally irrelevant during the second half of the game (although I do admit that the idea they had for them was a very good one). Then there's the audio which feels like taken from a Paul W.S. Anderson movie and the SFX are a mix of stock sounds (which I found hilarious).The recreation of Mega City One was great, but the outdated visuals make it less engaging (seriously, they were outdated even for its time ofrelease).I had some fun with this game, in fact, how I wish they would have mada Dredd 2 and use this story as the basis for the plot (with some polish it could make a great movie), but I cant recommend this to anyone. It's little flaws pile up to the point where the game stops being enjoyable.Buy it with a 50% or higher discount or if you're a hardcore Dredd fan. "

												Dredd vs Death is a short, dystopian fps where you go through the levels helping the citizens of mega city one until inevitablly you are sent somewhere else to help people and fight punks, cultists and undead until you eventually learn that 4 boss characters have escaped from prison and then you help the people where the boss characters went and beat the bosses, until you beat the final one, Death.The fps gameplay is mostly standard, you get to have 2 weapons maximum and you have to keep the pistol that all judges use. The judge pistol has several ammunition options such as explosive. flammble. and ricocheting options, but I found that they werent particularly useful or even detrimental; lighting people on fire didnt seem to do much damage and if they run towards you then you risk being burned. The high explosive mode doesn't have a huge radius for hitting enemies and most of the time its not worth the time required to change ammo from the normal ammunition. Additionally, on some levels you don’t get much of a refill on the judge pistol and usually have to rely on using an alternate weapon and these alternate pistol modes use your limited ammo faster. There is also some unneeded fluff such as  a reputation system where reputation increases when you arrest people and help citizens not get killed and decreases when you attack friendly targets and people who have already surrendered to be arrested; but this only matters for ratings unless you have the lowest reputation by killing friendlies, then the game will cause a mission failure. At some times there were bugs such as me sniping off some enemies that were set to be killed by a script and that caused a mission failure. Something that can get annoying at times is that its not clear where your next objective is, but the gameplay is fairly passable fps gameplay once you get past the bugs.The music in the game wasn't particularly memorable to me, but the dystopian setting and various advertisements for dubious fictional future products added to the atmosphere of the game. Given the short length and dated graphics in this game, I wouldn’t go out of my way to pick this up, but it was in a bundle and I got my copy from trading so I figured why not. Unless you really love the Dredd universe no matter the implementation, there are better games for your money.			"

												The game has a very particular look and design. It can be kind of funny according to some details of the story, the environment, NPCs, Dredd's comments and so on. Definitely is very cool to be able to arrest anybody walking on the streets with no reason, ;-p.The lack of challenging puzzles, final bosses or particular tough enemies make this game far too easy to overcome. I was only struggling once in a while when running out of ammo.If you are a Judge Dredd's fan, you will enjoy a few hours playing this game but don't expect something very serious.			"

												You know, it's kind of a shame this game exists and kind of not. On one hand it's a big bunch of lost and wasted potential which is really kinda sad but on the other hand it does a lot of things really good, speaking of its setting and all.But first things first: the story.Remember the movie? Yeah, neither do I, but what I do know is that the game's got nothing to do with it except for the fact that there's Judge Dredd in it. But since it originated from the comics it's fine.You are Judge Dredd, a badass cop in Mega City One who's trying to bring law, order and justice upon a chaotic world in which the line between crime and not-crime is blurred. The thing is: Some time ago the Dark Judges Judge Death, Fear, Fire and Mortis, who tried to kill everything in this city (they go by the motto ""The crime is life, the sentence is death"") were banished by Dredd and his associates but the local death cult of Mega City One now tries to free the Dark Judges and succeeds. Your quest is clear: Stop them at all costs.But what can I say, it's a short game. Once they're loose everything goes down pretty ♥♥♥♥ing quickly. I mean, really quickly. It's something like this: You're on patrol screwing up the bad guy's operations when suddenly: Problems at the Dark Judge containment facility. Then the Dark Judges escape, then there is a mission which completely unexpectedly leads you to the heart of the death cult of Mega City One, then you do some other ♥♥♥♥ and then come the last five missions where you are ordered to go to places where the Dark Judges try wreaking havoc. But I gotta say: the world fears 'em but srsly, the Dark Judges are weak. Three of them can't be killed by convential means, sure, but luckily there are conveniently placed things in each area that make defeating them possible. So all of the fights are pretty damn boring. Especially the last fight against Death. Because it wasn't even a fight. So the boss fights are terrible and in every sense hilariously awful.While we're at it: what about its gameplay?The gameplay of Judge Dredd: Dredd vs. Death is pretty much your standard FPS from that time. But it's got some unique features. The first one being the ability to arrest people. You know, the first couple of missions you are running through dark alleys and stuff with a lot of perps to arrest. So you shoot a bunch of guys until the others give up and then you arrest them. You can also kill them but that decreases your law-meter and hwen it reaches zero some other guys will hunt you down so you better don't do that. The arresting precedure has some kind of humour I must say. If you can read everything the perp is guilty of and how long the sentence will be. It's a pretty unique, if useless, feature but I liked it.Another feature is your main gun. It's not your standard issue pistol. With this thing, you can change ammunition types on the fly with the press of a button so that you can choose between several ""shot types"". For instance: Ricochet, explosive, incendiary, heat seeking or standard. It's a nice feature but also pretty much useless because I used the standard ammunition all the time anyway without even thinking about using something else.If I wanted to use something else I switched weapons. There are a couple of weapons in this game and you can carry two at all times. There aren't a lot of weapons, but there's some diversity. Two different pistols, two different shotguns, a machine gun, a sniper rifle which also can function as a light mg, a grenade launcher and a laser rifle which can also function as a sniper rifle. And you can hit people with your fist of course. And yeah, since it's a linear shooter, you can only have certain weapons in certain levels.Speaking of levels, let's talk about the modes in this game. There are two modes: Campaign mode and Arcade mode. The campaign mode is what you'd expect. A campaign with the story (that goes on for about maybe 4.5 hours tops) and all that. The arcade mode is different in that its missions are focused on mostly killing things (with the exception of the last few) and that it has nothing to do with the story whatsoever. In arcade mode, you initially have one mission out of twenty (I guess) unlocked and the missions unlock with progression through the main game. ""Why is that?"" you might ask. Well. Some arcade missions let you unlock cheats upon completion. The game developers wanted to make sure that you play through the game at least once before you can have each and every cheat.Each completion of a campaign or arcade mission grants you a rank of how well you did and either an arcade mission (campaign mode) or a cheat (arcade mode). Or it grants you a playable multiplayer model.Oh yeah, that's what I forgot. The multiplayer. Wanna know why I forgot it? Because the game's got no servers and multiplayer is virtually impossible via the internet. Just ignore that mode, you won't be able to play it anyway.Now, if we look at the game mechanics and ♥♥♥♥ there's really nothing new here that's outstandingly amazing and the enemy types are also not all that thrilling. But the game runs well on modern day systems (it should), it's got no bugs I would've spotted and it didn't crash a single time. That's an A+. Maybe. Sorta kinda.So, to wrap this up, let's look at the setting.And I wanna say it now because it's true: the setting is really cool and I love it. There aren't a lot of redeeming things about this game. But if there is one thing that I really liked it's the setting and the little bit of dialogue you can listen to while traversing through some areas. It's a dark, dystopic world which has a sense humour to it I really enjoy. Postal 2 was really great at conveying this humour to the player. If you wanna spot that humour on more occasions than the obvious dialogue in Judge Dredd: Dredd vs. Death you have to read between the lines. But still, it's great.It kinda shows in what world we might live a few decades from now. I had to laugh at lines like ""Grot Pot: With a snack THIS delicious, who needs nutricial value? Warning: may cause death"". Or ""All terminal patients are to remain in their beds. I mean, what's the point?"" upon a zombie apocalypse in a hospital. But that's not all. The NPCs you'll see and the areas which you will go through are awesomely designed. The big mega mall with tons of unhealthy food and other consumer goods and the rampant consumerism in that world which is conveyed to the player. Or the Smokatorium, a place for all nicotine addicts since public smoking is prohibited. And then the message ""We are legally obligated to remind you that tobacco is very, very, very bad for your health. But that nicotine sure is a rush, huh?"". The world and its design are great and this is where the wasted-potential-part comes in. With a setting this good the game devs could have made something better than this. But anyway. That about wraps it up. It's not a great game. If you think about it, the gameplay and story are pretty damn boring tbh. There aren't any game mechanics that are really ""cool"" so to speak. But the setting is really ♥♥♥♥ing great if you ask me. If it's cheap on sale I'd recommend you buy it. If it isn't on sale however you should spend your money on something more fun than this game. Still, I'll give it a ""recommended"".I myself played it because of its nostlagic value. Had a demo when I was a kid and now I found that game on Steam so I bought it during a sale. Was kinda worth it.			"

												This game is one of my favorite underrated gems from the early 2000's. You get to play as Judge Dredd. If thats not enough to make you wanna play it then there may be something wrong with you. Dredd vs. Death is an FPS by Rebellion in 2005. You play as the Judge Dredd and shoot and arrest your way through thugs, robberers, vampires, zombies and fat people. Dredd vs. Death is filled with the exact humor from the comics that will keep you grinning throughout the campaign. My only complaints are that the campaign is fairly short and that the multiplayer community is dead by now (it has been about 10 years since release). Even though it has a short campaign, dead community and dated graphics it's still a fun game to pick up and play.			"

												Judge Dredd: Dredd vs Death is an Ego-Shooter from the year 2003. While the graphics of the game haven`t aged so well, the humor definitely has. The one liners of the protagonist are spot on and that you have the power to arrest people because they are too fat or don`t possess a goldfish license just has to put a smile on your face. A bit annoying is that the jump movement is broken and you will only jump every fifth time or so. Fortunately the game requires you only to jump three times over the whole game.Dredd has to restore law and order in various sectors of the city while he fights against zombies, vampires, criminals and the four dark judges of the apocalypse. The mission have a great variety of locations and each feels a little bit different. Besides the interesting story there is also a arcade mode, in which you have defend hostages and need to defeat waves of enemies. The multiplayer is kind of dead, but if you got some friends you can also play the whole game in a coop campaign. One of the biggest weaknesses of the game on the other hand is the length of the campaign, which only lasts about 4-5 hours. But this 4 hours are truly entertaining and gave me in every second the feeling to be Judge Dredd, the only who can the defeat the criminal scumbags. I AM THE LAW !Result: As a Dredd fan I really enjoyed the game, it captures the atmosphere very well and is quite entertaining as long as it lasts. But if you are not Dredd fan, don`t like old games and if it is not on sale you will maybe give this one a pass due to its short campaign. Everyone else should at least take a closer look and at sale it sure is a good choice.7/10			"

												Picked this up on a whim and was pleasantly surprised.Sure the graphics are very dated (something a few steps above Half Life 1) but the gameplay is there - these are the guys that made Aliens vs Predator a few years earlier (PS imo AvP2 is way better what now eh). Also the music is pretty amazing. Story is you are the LAWRGG and you shoot lawbreakers and later some ghosts from another dimension or something. Silly fun stuff.A little twist is there is a kinda SWAT type element - you can shout orders to comply (at any time at anything - dumpsters are hardcore unrelenting criminals i tell ya) and cuff people. Some will surrender right away or if wounded enough or if they see you making new holes in their buddies. Each arrest increases a LAWFDDGF meter which can also decrease if you just shoot anything. Sometimes arrests factor into secondary objectives but mostly its a higher finishing score or a game over (i assume) if the meter reaches zero.Fun detail with that is you get a quick rap sheet which each arrest. Fat people you cuff for just being fat will be charged for stuff like ""Obstruction, 6 months"", enemies will get an extra homicide charge for friendly fire, and the smart ones who surrender right away will be charged with ""illegal assembly"" or somesuch. Stuff repeats after a while but i still got the occasional chuckle out of cuffing dudes in a zombie infested lab for having no hamster pet permit.Its kinda short - i blew thru it in around 7 hours (or maybe thats because im so good eheuueeueu) - but thats not necessarily a bad thing, maybe one more level or so but its ok considering the price.The only real problem i had was is you can carry only two weapons : a fixed slot for the Lawgiver pistol (which has multiple firing modes to be fair) and a second slot you can pick and choose. However Dredd obviously doesnt feel like carrying around ammunition if it isnt in a gun and so ammo isnt shared - whatever you have is dropped along with the gun and another of the same type will have its individual count and Lawgiver ammo is kind of rare. Which often resulted in me taking the secondary weapon with the most available ammo and not one id actually liked to use or in the cases of some later levels backtracking because there where lots of different guns with little ammo. Guess console ports are to blame.All in all a fast fun shooty game. Buy it creep! "

												This is an old game. It was released generally in the early 2000s and therefore, more modern advances in video graphics (i.e. DirectX9, shaders, HDR and volumetric lighting) and subsequent assumed conventions and expectations in games are not present. The game is short compared to a typical average epected singleplayer FPS and the the user interface is clearly venerable.There's too little variety in the characters. A fewe citizen archetypes, singular enemies. The storyline, despite being classic Dredd and with the Dark Judges, fails to truly hold my interest - the plot progression and game level objectives seem too separated and distinct from the main events unfolding and the results of success or failure are only visible as survive to the next level or game over.That's the negatives out of the way. If you're still reading, you might want to know that this game truly captures Judge Dredd, Mega City 1 (complete with fatties, scrawlers, Isocubes, Surfing and more) given the time of release and the technology employerd, the game does an excellent job of recreating the city environment faithfully to Bolland's artwork from the comics, and a typical cast of characters to boot.At the time of the game, Judge Hershey is CJ, Judge Anderson of course makes an appearance, but also there are the medics, Tek-Judges and mentions of the SJS (who investigate you if you don't uphold the law well enough). The voice-acting is hilarious and I am still unsure if this is intended or kitsch, but it certainly doesn't spoil the fun.Despite the short completion time for the main storyline singleplayer game, there are alternative gamemodes which promise a little extra replay value, and a multiplayer aspect, but unfortuantely, the internet multiplayer relied on GameSpy network and so is no longer functional, but if you have LAN connections you can play with others.

												A pretty fun shooter. Don't expect a masterpiece, but it's nowhere near as bad as critics claim it to be. Most gunfights are quite fast paced and satisfying, and that's what FPS games are all about. The control and handling is smooth, and most weapons are very fun to use. Graphics might've aged by now, but they do a decent enough of a job to make a believable sci-fi setting and to make you feel like you're in it.The game spans 10 story chapters. The first few levels have you fighting and arresting the perps, and the latter levels are more trigger happy and mostly have you fighting hordes of zombies and vampires. Some of the levels are done really well (The Docks, The Lab, The Hospital, The Undercity), whilst a few others were more of an annoyance than anything (The Training, The Smokatorium). The training level should've been completely optional and isn't a very interesting way to introduce new players to the game. However, if you can stomach it, the game really picks up from there.There isn't much of a story there. The dark judges escape and you spend most of the game hunting each one down. The boss fights were somewhat disappointing. 3 of the 4 of them simply involved you walking around the level and pressing switches, and only one of them was an actual full-on battle where you had to shoot the baddie down. Having said that, most FPS games tend to have very badly done boss fights, so wouldn't be fair to single out this game specifically.The game also contains some arcade levels, but they lose their appeal very fast as you realise most of them is just you vs a big group of enemies with too little health. The (5-6 hour) story campaign is the only reason to play this game really, so if you're up for some fun sci-fi gunfights, you should have a good time playing this game.			"

												I am a very big Judge Dredd fan, and I must say that this game surprised a lot in how faithful to the original comic books it was. However, the story part of the game was fairly short (took me 5 hours). Gameplay-wise it was a solid fps and I have nothing to complain about the controls. I wish someone would make another Dredd game someday. Maybe with an open-world setting and interesting side quests. There is great potential in a free roaming cop-game with quirky twists. So for the Dredd fans, this is a definitive must-have, especially since this is so ridiculously cheap (I bought this for under 2€ during a sale if I remember correctly) and for others this could be a great opportunity to be introduced to this fantastic character.

												I cannot stress enough how fantastic this game is!Firstly, this is true to the comic style, the characters look brilliant, the guns look brilliant, the voices are brilliant, the maps are brilliant etc etc, for a game made in 2003 it works and looks fantastic! The main story is wonderful! 11 chapters in total (12 if you count training) and they are all linear and fun, there is even the odd slightly unsettling and creepy level, such as the under city and the shopping mall (I won't reveal any spoilers!) I've played this game since I was 9 (I'm 17 now) and probably completed it over 60 times but man, I still love every second of every mission! Dredd's hardcoreness is perfect in this game! The arcade missions are also lots of fun, working to unlock all the cheats so you can play campaign again and have fun with cheats like infinite law meter and touch of mortis! Multiplayer is also a lot of fun with bots and friends over Lan (I think you can still do online??)When you play this game and read the comics, you'll see why you could be left expecting more from the films. The Stallone film is a bit naff and not true to Dredd's personaility but the costumes and sets and props etc are on point, but the 2013 film catches Dredd's personailty greatly like this game does, but the costumes are a bit eh. You'll think to yourself ""Where were those damn vampires, zombies and dark judges?????""All in all, buy this game right now! If we can get this game some exposure maybe we will finally see a sequel or remake, so get buying and raving! It will not disapoint, I assure you!			"

												Pros:Story: pretty good keeps to the comics.Audio: Music and Voice acting is ok.Weapons: good variety of ammo, bouncy bullets, fire, etc etcCons:Gameplay isnt great, player movement is pretty ♥♥♥♥ in story mode, tends to be better in battles (multiplayer/vs bots.)Story Mode is short (completed 3/4 hours)Graphics badly dated and the models are ugly. Other info:Difficulty on story mode which i played on normal was pretty easy, boss fights and levels are pretty straight forward. You can only take one path. The boss fight on level 10 was probally the hardiest but still pretty easy compared with other games.Arcade is pretty fun but gets boring quickly.Online is supposed to be fun, the game runs very similar to quake but I could not find any servers even with google.To be honest the game is pretty ♥♥♥♥ and if it did not have judge dredd in the title nor the comicbook story (the dark judges arc) you would probally not even bother to look at the store page. I like judge dredd but I feel this game isnt even worth buying as a fan. Its not that its the worst fps game but its just really boring and generic. give it a pass.4/10I AM THE  LUHHHHHHHHHHHH			"

												Bite Size Review - Judge Dredd: Dredd vs. DeathThe Good:+The old school gameplay, levels with bosses +The cheesy one liners are pretty good+Old school game, but it has checkpoints which is actually really nice+Old school game, but it has waypoints, which helps in navigating some of the levels+Colorful graphics+Funny design choices (some civilians are really fat, like 1000 pounds and walking around its cartoony and fun)+Vampires and Zombies (I ♥♥♥♥ you not)+Arresting mechanic, you hit E to tell enemies you have hurt a bit to surrender, and then F on enemies to slap cuffs on them and see a tiny bio of what they are charged with, it's kind of coolThe Bad:-Really only 3 variations of enemies (zombies, vampires, and cult members)-Weapons feel somewhat useless compared to the Judge Pistol, your default weapon-Story, go here and kill boss repeat, its fine but just don't expect amazing -Graphics are old looking, and Dredd’s face is oddly wrinklyThe Verdict:Straight up, I bought this game for $2. I had 3 hours of fun with it, during which I arrested purps, shot vampires and zombies, and got to hear cool one liners. The weaponry in the game left a lot to be wanted, since the default pistol was the best one by far, and there was nothing special about the story. This is a true B game if I ever saw one, and I enjoyed just running around the colorful levels and shooting stuff. "

												Im a big fan on 2000AD and Judge Dredd, but this game is not very good..... at all, it took me 3 hours to beat the campaign  and I was playing on the hardest difficulty, The levels are linear and the objectives are always the same ""Go Here"" or ""kill him"" or ""Defend the civilians"".There is a variety of weapons in the game, but because your initial weapon, the lawgiver, has so many shooting modes like ricochet and incinderary ammo, you wont have a reason to use any other weapons in the game becuase ammo for them is usually scarce, unless you meat ahorde of enemies that all use the exact same weapon, one level I recall, a cult group used heavy machine guns, ALL OF THEM, so I was constantly getting ammo for the gun, it was so powerful that I beat the level in about 5 minutes. The Dark Judges were dissapointing laughly beatable, For supernatural creatures that are unkillable, they sure were easy to defeat and we got barely anytime with them, the build up was good, but the executuion was terrible. The story felt shallow and non canon, the satire and crude humour of the comics is here, but thats it, its there, but nothing else. After beating a level, you will be awarded with multiplayers skins, but there is no incentive to go back and get them all, because the online mode of this game is shallow and boring, it might have been interesting back in its inception, but compared to todays standards, you are going to get bored....FAST! Maybe get this game on sale, but dont expect much,It wont add anything to the Dredd universe or lore, a terribly mediocre game.			"

												I wanted to like this game, as a fan of 2000AD I didn't think I could be as solidly insulted as I was by the first Dredd movie ever again. Gods was I wrong, while the artwork is reminscent of the lines of the 90s comic the story is lacking real substance. The gameplay itself is frustrating, enemies often being hard to engage effectively for various reasons. Arresting had a fun interesting lines and largely did justice to the comic but if you want a decent 2000AD game you'd do far better with Rogue Trooper.As for me I'd rather sing ""Tutti-Frutti"" while JImping outside Grand Hall of Justice before playing this game ever again.

												Dredd vs Death is fun and even charming, but it's honestly pretty bad. The gameplay is...not great.Essentially, you have your lawgiver (with its many firing modes) and the ability to yell commands at citizens. See someone scrawling? You can run them down, force them to surrender and put them in the cubes for life. Dredd v Death’s gameplay is that it’s arcade based. You’re always being scored based how many enemies you kill, how many years you sentenced, and how long it took you to complete the mission. In order to get the best score, you cannot kill perps, you have to shoot the weapon out of their hands (or kill their leader unit) then go and individually arrest and sentence each one of them. This contributes to the tone of a Judge Dredd game, but it really ruins the pacing since you have to stop to give a dozen life sentences before moving onto the next dungeon. The other problem is the mass amount of escorting. There are only 11 levels and 4 of them have escort missions. When you realize that civilians are killed in 1-2 punches, you’ll understand why this is an issue.  Additionally, the difficulty curve here is incredibly steep.  Vampires, the most common undead enemy, take 5 armor piercing bullets to kill on Normal difficulty. They take 7-8 on hard. This is an issue because the lawgiver uses the same ammo bar for every kind of bullet.  More powerful bullets use more ammo. Additionally, more powerful ammo types have a lower rate of fire. What all this means is that on normal difficulty, you’ll quickly run out of bullets toward the end of the game. If you’re playing on hard…Grudd help you.Although the lawgiver has been lovingly recreated, there aren't a lot of opportunities to make use of it. You'll use standard and armor piercing 90% of the time. Ricohet is basically useless. You're often penalized for using hot shot. It can take 5-10 ""high explosive"" shots to kill a single enemy. I couldn't even find a single time to use the heat seeking ammo mode. Levels should have been designed to make use of these ammo modes. Instead, the levels are incredibly simplistic offices and hallways. The graphics are pretty bad (even for the time) and the city feels vacant, empty, and lifeless. The story… is also not great. Here it is: Dredd’s on patrol. Vampires show up. Vampires are taken to prison. Vampires break out of prison. Dark Judges break out of Prison. Dredd has to go capture them.   There are 11 levels in Dredd v Death. The Dark Judges don’t break out of prison until the end of the lengthy level 2.  Not only that, but one of the levels is just a boss fight, nothing more. So what is good? The humor. The humor is this game’s saving grace. You can arrest any citizen for insane trumped up charges such as littering or owning a gold fish. Almost every level includes a silly announcer to match the environment.			"

												The game is not worth your money, not even during season prices. The campaign story is short, boring, silly and forgettable. Sometimes, enemies will be able to shoot you easilly, probably due to bot aim - I don´t think that is correct game design. Nobody plays multiplayer, so only the single-player matters nowdays. The only cool thing in the game your standart weapon that can fire mutiple types of rounds, but still, I found myself only using half of this, since the other half are completely non-usefull and miss targets.Also, personally, I don´t like the story of a future dystopian totalitarian society, where there is no freedom, police brutality is tolerated and you can get be sentenced for several months in prison for ""ilegally"" owning a fish or a hamster as pets.Cannot recommend it. 3.5/10			"

												A super fascist in a future city fights a transdimensional wraith who only understands death to be the correct state of existence. Why isn't this game the utter perfection it deserves to be? Who took the unstoppable, mortal personifcation of law and his putrid counterpart who wars on life and turned it into a third-rate Duke Nukem? Where is my Lawmaster bike? Where is the untold genocide that Mega City One is famous for? They are not here. They are buried in time, in the black and white pages of old British comic books. Seldomly are they unearthed and adapted, and just once in an epoch do they recieve Dredd's perfect justice.			"

												It has fun ideas like switching weapon modes for the main gun and 'arresting' people (thugs etc just because you can). I had some fun with it but overal it gets repetive (maps are ok, weapons beside of the pistol that can switch fire modes are generic, enemies are generic). Graphics are also not that good for a 2005 game in my opinion. If steam would have a 'maybe' option to recommend the game I would select that instead of 'no'. I would love to see a new Dredd though with better gunplay + graphics and with richer maps. The Dredd universe has lots of potential.			"

												I got the game for less than two dollars. Unless you get it that cheap, you're not getting a good price. It's just funny to read some of the signs and arrest some people. Lots of great satire involved in both. However, once the shooting starts, it all falls to pieces. There are various gunshot types for the handgun, such as incendiary rounds, armor-piercing rounds, heat-seeking rounds, explosive rounds, ricochet rounds, burst normal rounds, and maybe something else I'm forgetting, too. Anyway, it's really impressive for one gun when this game came out. However, the enemies you encounter on the latter part of the first stage and during the second stage are easier to kill with punches...slow, wound up punches. The gunplay simply isn't fun. Despite all the ammo options, actually shooting the enemies just isn't enjoyable for me. The difficulty is pretty high on Normal and I can't be bothered to try it on Easy. I probably -could- do it, but aside from the satire, there's nothing fun about this game so far to make me want to keep playing it instead of ignoring it or just watching for the satire portions on Youtube.

												Dredd vs. Death is an old school shooter with an extra component about arresting the perps that had surrendered. Don't shoot unarmed people, but any one armed is fair game. Heck, if you want to take a few hits, shoot legs or punch/pistol whip perps to make them surrender, THEN cuff them for higher ratings. You can't shoot everybody. The problem is the game was dated, and relies on health paks (finding them) and hiding enemies that pop out that you have to constantly scan left and right for enemies at all angles. So you end up looking around every corner, making it feel like the original Doom. The story was quintessential Judge Dredd, though the cutscenes are a bit outdated. And the different weapons are a bit underwhelming. Even the multiple modes of the pistol is a bit underwhelming as you don't see them being useful yet, at least in the earlier missions. And the checkpoints are far apart that made playing difficult in parts, esp. when you don't get extra life or health paks when you reload. It's oldie, and mainly for nostalgia.			"

												I'd agree with most of the other reviews.  The more interesting aspects of the earlier levels, arresting perps for criminal offences in particular, are abandoned early on leaving 75% of the game as wandering round dark corridors killing legions of undead.  Dredd's Lawgiver is accurately reproduced from the comic strip although there's no role here for the Lawmaster bike.  Equally this is 95% ""shoot 'em up"".  There's no crime investigation, gathering clues, interrogating witnesses.  There's only the odd puzzle to break up the sort of non stop gun play last seen in ""Desperado"".  Also being Judge Dredd other than restocking ammo for or replacing your secondary weapon there's no role here for looting and upgrades.As with many games of this type the penultimate level is more difficult than the final level - primarily due to its length and limited medi kits.Like other reviewers I'd recommend getting the game in a sale where (with at least 50% off) you won't mind the relatively poor even for its time graphics and limited gameplay.Why the positive mark then ?  Well it is 2000 A.D.'s iconic Judge, weapons and characters are accurately imported from the original stories, and it's a competent first person shooter.That said the game that could be made now of the comic by a Bethseda, Rockstar, or Bioware could be awesome - more locations, more varied NPC interaction, some L.A. Noire style detective work, far better graphics.S.x.			"

												Pros:1. Fun FPS that encourages you to not just kill everything in sight, as you want to arrest people for points. You can accomplish this by shooting weapons out of enemies hands or injuring them until they give up.2. Nice open colourful levels to explore and find hidden resources or complete optional sidequests. 3. Great sound track that thumps along to the action in the game. 4. Decent voice acting for Dredd and some of the other charcters.5. Additional side content of arena fights an multiplayer is available.Cons:1. It's short, you can complete a Normal casual pace playthrough in 5 hours of the single player campaign. Once you've dealt with the hospital the game races to the finish. Specifically it feels like levels are missing, in the later half of the game, perhaps due to the developers running out of time or money.2. The boss 'fights' are really lacking in excitement or challenge. I realise that you cannot really kill the dark judges, but they needed to come up with more interesting engagements. In the end I still recommend the game, because I had an enjoyable FPS experience mostly during the first half of the game and due to a lack of an alternative Dredd game.			"

												I haven't played much of it, but from what I have played, I can see that this is a good game. The Graphics are old, but not unplayable, this game isn't just using the name of Dredd to make a shooter, it would fit the comic. It sounds like what Dredd should sound like, the Lawgiver feels like the Lawgiver, with changable ammo for it(Normal, AP, Ricochet, High Ex, Heat Seeking) at a click of a button(actually you scroll with the mouse wheel to do so). The NPCs like Fatties offers funny dialogues, but humour is also given by the reasons for arrest: The game generates sentences which includes real crimes like rioting, assault, resisting arrest, and also owning a fish/hamster without a license which earns you a month in the cubes. As Dredd you can arrest anyone you want, Afterall: You are the law.			"

												really fun, solid gunplay and the judge dredd voicing really makes it. The ragdolls make it that much more fun and judge dredd's signature pistol having all the unique firing modes was great. Arresting people was pretty humourous, especially fat people.I would've liked it to be a bit longer with maybe a few more enemy variants, after being exposed to vampires and zombies I expected the other dark judges to have unique enemies to go with them but alas the game was still quite good.

												The introductory levels are a little slow at first and some mechanics of the game can be a little clunky at times in some of the scenarios of the game. But even with that though, I had much fun playing this oddity from start to finish as Megacity-One's most hardass Judge with an itchy trigger-finger and an itcher pair of handcuffs in a crime-ridden, monster-infested future. The only thing I consider disappointing about it is that the story-campaign lasts about eight hours and that this game only has LAN-only multiplayer -meaning you will have to install a LAN-faking client like Hamachi, Gameranger or so on to connect with your friends online with some stablity issues. It can't be helped though, seeing as this is a 2003 game.All-in-All, if you like classic shooters with some sleazy-cheesy style and have some time to kill, don't miss out on this little rusty gem.BE THE LAW!

												-The game is based on the 2000ad Dredd strip, NOT on the movies. So expect a lot of the cheesy dialog, one liners and the satire usually found in the comic.  What you should not expect are high production values, the game not being a very consolized shooter or a long single player campaign. I found some (mostly from melee based) enemies just stand between obstacles like pillars and irregular terrain without reacting to the player. Same thing if you stand on high ground or similar situations, so the AI isn't a high point either.-The enemies are varied at the start but in the end you'll fight pretty much the same type of bad guys in the last 3 levels making it a bit boring if it wasn't for the ammo constraints due to the fact that in story mode you can only choose your secondary weapon and all the Lawgiver modes  share the same ammunition.-On the good side it has a lot of references to the strip and its many iconic stories and characters, an arcade mode with short levels you unlock as you complete the story mode (with some interesting cameos) and a funny, but really short campaign. The game is fast paced and doesn't pull any punches when it comes to difficulty unlike most modern shooters released during these last years, containing also enough flavor and variety to compensate for its flaws.-I recommend it if you have nothing else to do with the ""hard earned"" money you got selling cards, and I strongly recommend it if you like the comic strip Dredd. Stay away if you only watched the movies or if you don't really want to play what it  was a budget game when it was released.			"

												If you like FPS games and Judge Dredd and know how to not take things too seriously, this is a good game.  Personally, I love FPS games and Judge Dredd, so I had a blast playing through the campaign.  I'm not a nitpick every little detail Dredd fan, but I've got a couple of the ""Case Files"" books full of early Dredd comics and some other Dredd comics, so I know about Dredd and the world he comes from.Looks wise, it won't win any awards, not even by 2005 standards.  It's not photo realistic, nor do I think it's intended to be.  Since it's based on the comics, I think they were going for a comic look and they succeeded.  Still, it's not an ugly game.  It's got decent graphics and the recreation of Mega City One is pretty fantastic.  Plus, since it is from 2005, I'm able to play on nearly max settings and it looks really good on those settings.  The only thing I wasn't able to max was the AA (anti aliasing) because 8X won't work on my system, for some reason.  But, I got it working at 4X AA.Plot wise, it's pretty simple.  Obviously, you play as Judge Dredd, the super cop, prosecutor,  judge, jury and, if necessary, executioner of the future.  The story is simple, Judge Death and the other Dark Judges have escaped (again) and it's up to Dredd to hunt them all down.  The campaign takes you all over MC1 and even into the under city, old New York and to the Deadworld, home of the Dark Judges.  You fight street thugs, zombies, vampires, cultists and, of course, the Dark Judges themselves.  Mostly, it's run and gun, with fast paced action and levels.  I don't think any level took more than 30 minutes, the shortest was less than 10 minutes.  I have 7.2 hours in the game, but not all of that is in the campaign.  I've also played Arcade Mode some.  The array of weapons is nice.  Of course, you have the standard Justice Department sidearm, the Lawgiver, with its variety of ammunition.  You can also pick up secondary weapons.  There are other pistols, rifles, shotguns, machine guns, grenade launchers and even laser weapons.  One of the most fun aspects of the game is the ability to arrest and sentence people.  Some are enemies that surrender, others are people off the street that you sentence for whatever ""crimes"" they're committing.  Loitering, parking violations, possession of a hamster or goldfish without a license, smoking, whatever.  Also, if they talk back, you can add on 10-20 years for resisting arrest.  In some levels, I had over 3,000 years total sentences given out.  And, once the campaign is over, there's always Arcade Mode, which adds to the replayability.The game does have a few issues, which is why not taking things too seriously is necessary to enjoy it.  I understand there were some issues with development, so the campaign isn't what they were hoping it would be.  Still, it's fun if you take it with a grain of salt.  There are some AI bugs, like enemies that ""fly away"" after being shot.  But, that stuff is actually pretty funny, in my opinion.  None of it really makes the game unplayable, in my opinion.  If all of this doesn't have you already pushing ""Add to Cart,"" wait for it to go on sale if it isn't already.  I got it on sale for a little over a dollar during the Black Friday sale, and it was money well spent.  Still, I'd say it's worth the asking price, but that's just me.			"

												This game to me is a great experience. I read a few of the Judge Dredd comic series and it actually includes the Dark Judges. I find them to be a very important part of the Judge Dredd universe as they're so unique and just as badass as Dredd himself. I'd recomend this game to any fans of the comic or even fans of the newer movie. Learn the roots of what inspired the newer style of Dredd. Those golden shoulder pads man. Mint. "

												In Dredd Vs Death, YOU ARE THE LAW! Prowl the streets of Mega City One as the cities greatest judge as you punch up and arrest perps and civilians, Lay down the law on Zombies and Vampires by blowing them way with your Lawgiver and dispense justice to the sinister Dark Judges, vile undead from another dimension that fully believe life itself is a crime and that the sentence is death.I'll say it up front, This game is really for fans of the Judge Dredd comic book seires as this little gem from the early 2000's can be described as very true to the source material. Meaning its NOT like the Sylvester Stallone movie from the 90's and it is NOT like the Karl Urban ""Dredd"" movie from a few years ago. Think of it a mix of both. Its cartoony and campy in some places while it still has a bit darkness to it. As a game on it's own there isnt really anything spectacular or innovative about it when it to the point that one can easily compare it to Halo: Combat Evolved that came out two years prior. The game runs well on PC and in terms of comparison the only things i can say about DvD that's really different than Halo would be the following:- The world itself (of course)- A points system where if you manage to obtain a high ranking after you complete a level you will be rewarded with extra game content such as new skins for multiplayer (which has a VS Bots mode if for whatever reason you wanted to play some Dredd pvp) and mini games a for a bit of extra new game plus.- The lack of vehicle use. There's not even a level where you can ride on Dredd's iconic Lawmaster bike.- Your primary weapon, ""The Lawgiver"" is going to be your main weapon in the game. While there are some other weapons availiable to you such as shotguns and grenade launchers, you will find  yourself using the Lawgiver alot more as it multiple firing modes (e.g. Rapid Fire & Incendiary rounds) are the best response to the varity of threats in the game.- And that you have bosses.The four bosses in the game, The Dark Judges: Fear, Fire, Mortis and their leader Death are not your regular boss battles, since they are undead they cannot be killed by traditional means and sometimes the boss fight requires you to do something different in order to win and to achive a higher rank at levels end. For example in order to defeat Judge Mortis at the hospital level with the most ""brownie points"" you will need to rescue all the hostages he has with him and yes they too can be killed at the slightest touch.In conclusion. This game as i mentioned is not for everyone except for those who either are fan of the comics this game is heavily based on and those who are looking fora cheap FPS to help pass the time. I recommend this game as the former but as the latter do not expect too much from this game.			"

												This game is just plain and simply awesome. Though it doesn't stray too far from the average FPS genre, it certainly makes good use of it's license. It uses the Judge Dredd universe very well and definitely isn't being shy towards content. Graphics aren't the best or most polished, but it doesn't need to be. The gameplay and levels all feel nice and story has a good pacing and takes pages from the comics. Judge Dredd is a very entertaining video game and I would gladly play through this again. 11/10			"

												I haven't played much of it, but from what I have played, I can see that this is a good game. The Graphics are old, but not unplayable, this game isn't just using the name of Dredd to make a shooter, it would fit the comic. It sounds like what Dredd should sound like, the Lawgiver feels like the Lawgiver, with changable ammo for it(Normal, AP, Ricochet, High Ex, Heat Seeking) at a click of a button(actually you scroll with the mouse wheel to do so). The NPCs like Fatties offers funny dialogues, but humour is also given by the reasons for arrest: The game generates sentences which includes real crimes like rioting, assault, resisting arrest, and also owning a fish/hamster without a license which earns you a month in the cubes. As Dredd you can arrest anyone you want, Afterall: You are the law.			"

												Well, a very good friend of mine gave me this for ST. Patricks day and i can say now that most of the negative reviews are fairly wrong, or are just out there to bash an old game. I personally admit the game does look pretty dated after 12 (kinda important to remember that) years. Please allow me to repeat that, this game is actually 12 years old. Give it a little slack on the graphics part. Overall the graphics arent the worst ive seen but im guessing they wanted gameplay over shiny looking walls and the like.For actual gameplay, i quite enjoyed it actually, combat feels a little challenging, enough to keep me focused, not enough to make me feel threatened once i get use to it. Also yeah, you can only have 2 guns at a time. Would you prefer a ton of guns that are boring and poorly fleshed out or a good couple of guns that feel how one would think they would? The Lawgiver pistol in particular is a fantastic weapon you will always have with you and can do its job pretty well. Personally speaking i honestly dislike the none Judge weaponry but there is probably one that fits your play style.Performance, my office laptop that runs on windows 8 can manage the thing so im pretty sure people having problems with it are using something the game hates. To be fair for whatever reason my laptop seems capable of running anything short of AAA titles from 2013 onwards, everything prior and after (that isnt an AAA title) it can manage with ease. Back to the game, its overall pretty good if a little short, the Civilian AI is pretty stupid and often will just stand around and get brutally murdered if you leave them there.Finally the whole thing on the whole is dated (12 years old, i shall never stop pointing that out where relevant) but by far and away not the worst game, and certainly good for some fun, plus it has bot support in multiplayer (i think, actual multiplayer is probably long dead but you can setup multiplayer games with bots when you solo it) as i said before the guns and gameplay are great and all but sometimes you'll be a little (at least) frustrated with the civilian AI, and occasionally your team mates, had one of them get stuck on the stairs and i had to go back for him. I would rate the game about maybe 8-9/10 on the whole, only things i objectively dislike is the civilian AI, occasionally the health system as its kinda weird, and i did have the weapon ammo counter go weird and i couldnt tell whether i had ammo or not, and because i was curious (and quite stupid) i wasted my last magasine finding out, though id put this down to simply not being able to see the ammo counter clearly.

												This game is just plain and simply awesome. Though it doesn't stray too far from the average FPS genre, it certainly makes good use of it's license. It uses the Judge Dredd universe very well and definitely isn't being shy towards content. Graphics aren't the best or most polished, but it doesn't need to be. The gameplay and levels all feel nice and story has a good pacing and takes pages from the comics. Judge Dredd is a very entertaining video game and I would gladly play through this again. 11/10			"

												You know all those dystopian sci-fi games where they make the reports of today on police brutality look like kids fighting on the playground (i.e. Half Life 2)? Yeah, well the difference between those games and this game is that, instead of being the leader of group of rebels trying to fight the law, YOU ARE THE LAW! Want to arrest a fat person for owning a hamster without a licence? Go ahead. What about giving a life sentences to some teenagers who were spraypainting an abandoned building? Whose going to stop you? Just remember to go stop that genocidal, undead maniac trying to destroy the world in the meantime.			"

												OK, I played this game on my channel, so you can see that at some points all I wanted was to punch myself in the face cause it can get so incredibly hard. But, this game is great.The graphics are alittle vibrant, but there were times where the atmosphere was creepy and I got jumped afew times. Has an interesting machinic with the arrest feature (which was sad that after a while it becomes unused and unnecissary) which still made you feel as if you were a copper arresting litteraly EVERYONE because EVERYONE is shooting at you. Ragdoll was GREAT! It is someones point of view to look at ragdoll and judge, for instance, someone might be mad that the ragdoll takes away from the realism of the game.  But for me, it was freakin halarious.  Watching a body spasm after getting shot with a shotgun never gets old.Story line was good and (I think) well thought out, and even though I wanted to quit when it got encreadibly hard, I was interested to see what would happen next.  Voice acting was alittle strange, but ok. One-liners were cheesy but will stick with you forever (update: every time I read a Dredd Comic now,  cannot read it with out Dredd sounding like the game voice actor)Don't expect to play this with anyone other than yourself or a friend, cause the servers dead.One very agrivating thing though was the autosave locations and the OPness of EVERY enemy in the game (friendly advice: see a zombie or vampire? Stay the hell away).  You'd get super far into the fighting, nearly almost done with the objective, then get cornered by a zombie who could get one lucky swipe, and be forced to restart all the way back from the start. This gets VERY agrivatingIn General, you'll get a few hours (around 3-4 hours) of Gameplay, and if your a fan of the Judge Dredd comics, chances are you'll like this.with accordance to gameplay, and Dredd comic book accuracy,My overall rating:8.5/10			"

												-The game is based on the 2000ad Dredd strip, NOT on the movies. So expect a lot of the cheesy dialog, one liners and the satire usually found in the comic.  What you should not expect are high production values, the game not being a very consolized shooter or a long single player campaign. I found some (mostly from melee based) enemies just stand between obstacles like pillars and irregular terrain without reacting to the player. Same thing if you stand on high ground or similar situations, so the AI isn't a high point either.-The enemies are varied at the start but in the end you'll fight pretty much the same type of bad guys in the last 3 levels making it a bit boring if it wasn't for the ammo constraints due to the fact that in story mode you can only choose your secondary weapon and all the Lawgiver modes  share the same ammunition.-On the good side it has a lot of references to the strip and its many iconic stories and characters, an arcade mode with short levels you unlock as you complete the story mode (with some interesting cameos) and a funny, but really short campaign. The game is fast paced and doesn't pull any punches when it comes to difficulty unlike most modern shooters released during these last years, containing also enough flavor and variety to compensate for its flaws.-I recommend it if you have nothing else to do with the ""hard earned"" money you got selling cards, and I strongly recommend it if you like the comic strip Dredd. Stay away if you only watched the movies or if you don't really want to play what it  was a budget game when it was released.			"

												really fun, solid gunplay and the judge dredd voicing really makes it. The ragdolls make it that much more fun and judge dredd's signature pistol having all the unique firing modes was great. Arresting people was pretty humourous, especially fat people.I would've liked it to be a bit longer with maybe a few more enemy variants, after being exposed to vampires and zombies I expected the other dark judges to have unique enemies to go with them but alas the game was still quite good.

												A classic addition to anyone's library. I will take all of biased fan-dom and set it aside for the time being and recommend this game purely for its general all round entertainment value. Sure, the story is (Very) short and the combat can feel a little clunky when you compare it to the likes of other games of its time (Yes Halo we're looking at you!) but I can't help but look back with fond memories over this little gem. The only crime this game commits is leaving us wanting for more content, a crime that will unfortunately earn this title life in the iso-cubes of history as one of many titles that could have been so much more. Worth the money in a sale for definate.			"

												As of now I have 5 hours clocked on this game and I have completed it.I loved this game. It's graphics have aged quite badly but hey this game came out 2003 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge_Dredd:_Dredd_vs._Death The Music has an 80's vibe like I am playing Command and Conquer games again and loved avery minute of it. The level at the start can seem bizzare and unintuitive but they get better the further in you get.Enemies actually have fairly good AI. Gang members hide behind cover, run away from yoiu, run at you and in many cases are better than many games AI from today.You get to see Mega City One, Undercity, Docking yards, Smokatorium, A Hospital, the famed Reclamation where meat wagons go. They really tried hard with the games settings and took full advantage of the Dredd Universes style and famed spots within and underneath Mega City One.You will mot likely have to look up certain boss fights especially Judge Fear as it is not well explained how you defeat him.All in all I really enjoyed this game for less than £5.00 well worth its selling proice I can only hope future Judge Dredd games use this as a basis of how to make a good game and build up from it and add to it.Thank you Rebellion for making this game it was incredibly enjoyable.

												Probably one of my favorite aspect of this game is that in most cases you don't have to kill people as long as you can disable them from using thier guns. It then lets you know how many years worth of arrests you made at the end of the level.If half life 1 era graphics are not your thing then you will be turned off by the visual. It seems odd because it has ragdoll physics in it which has me wondering when exactly ragdolls where introduced into gaming. I know half life 2 wasn't the first game to use them but I didn't think older era games had them too.Overall it is a wondeful that is well within the spirit of the Judge Dredd comics. I hope the make a sequal with updated graphics. That would be great.			"
