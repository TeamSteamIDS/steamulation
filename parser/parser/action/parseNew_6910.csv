												In 1997, John Romero of Ion Storm Dallas approached the producer of System Shock, Warren Spector, said ""Make the game of your dreams. No limits"" and the end result was the creation of Ion Storm Austin and their first game; Deus Ex.Deus Ex is a First-Person Shooter/Role Playing Game with a heavy emphasis on stealth and thinking carefully about your surroundings. The game provides you, from start to finish, with a number of ways to solve every single problem put in front of you. The level design is open ended enough for any method of completion.The game is inspired by Looking Glass Studio's System Shock and Thief and as a result, the freedom you have to approach and complete your objectives is simply staggering. You are given a huge world to explore, some tools you might want to use to complete your objectives and let loose upon your environment. Careful exploration is needed to uncover all of the hidden gadgets, secret tunnels and small story elements.The only time you will ever receive a Game Over is if you die. There are no penalties for doing things your way and the game dynamically changes as you play. People in the game may think differently of you if you don't do what they expect of you and may effect certain things as you progress through the story.Speaking of Story, the story of Deus Ex is one of a heavily political and conspiratorial nature. You play as JC Denton, an agent on his first day with the UNATCO, an organization that deals with the growing rise of foreign and domestic terrorism in the early 21st century. It does not take long however for JC to discover that he is merely a pawn in a huge political game that leans far beyond his own understanding.He will have to travel far and wide to gather the help he needs from unsuspecting allies. Hong Kong, Paris, New York City and various US locations will be visited, all of which have a fitting Tech-noir feel and stellar music to match. One listen of the music for Hong Kong and you'll never forget it.Being an Role-Playing Game as well as a shooter, Deus Ex allows you to customize your character to your preference. The game features a skill system that will allow you to improve JC in a number of fields. Like big guns? Master the Heavy Weapons skill and go in with the GEP Gun blowing people and locked doors to bits. Want to silently infiltrate every location with skill and precision? Master Computers and Lockpicking to open doors, hack security machines, ATM machines for money (if you don't find any bank account details lying around) and read e-mails for clues about the environment you're in.Another notable part of Deus Ex are its unforgettable characters. Every major character in the game has a well rounded personality with their own expectations of you. What you do in the world or tell them can affect how they treat you which might be crucial in your immediate future.There are boss battles in the game but some may be avoided entirely by learning information from other characters. If you do walk into a boss fight, you even have the choice of running right out the door behind them and not bother engaging them at all! When was the last time a game let you do that? Things might even happen to that character later on if you don't fight them.With all the above praise, Deus Ex is not without its small faults however. Some of the levels are huge and empty of detail, forcing long walks if you want to get anywhere specific in a short amount of time. The large empty levels also make the game feel a little devoid of life in some places. A lot of areas that look as if they should be full of people, are completely empty except for maybe two or three characters at once.With every conspiracy theory under the sun under the microscope in Deus Ex, you must learn to question everything and trust no one.  You may even find that things that this game was talking about in the Year 2000 are happening right now or have a very real possibility to happen at some point during our lifetimes; wealth and the increasing gap between the rich and the poor across the globe, omnipresent electronic surveillance, technical augmentations that can enhance the human race beyond what nature intended and much more.It's a roller-coaster ride of a game that everyone simply has to play to experience at least once. Your favourite game was probably inspired by this piece of art so do yourself a favour, set next weekend aside and play this game already. You will never leave the house without your tin-foil hat again!			"

												Deus Ex is one of the Greatest Games i've ever played. And I remember when space invaders came out!You are doing yourself a terrible disservice by not trying out this game, even though by todays standards the graphaics may lack.. but the substance, and the depth and ambiance is there.Dont let my lack of play time on steam fool you. I still have my original ISO and its installed on my laptop.I purchased this game just in case.. and also so i could write a review of this game.I can honestly say I will never; not be able to run this game. Even if it means keeping a relic of a pc around 50 years from now just so i can fire this game up on occasion and play it, I will do just that.Cheers. "

												Where it all began. Can't believe that this was released on Windows 2000, 15 years ago! Still to this day we are gifted with excellent mods for it, currently Caustic Creative are developing a wonderful overhaul mod named Deus Ex: Revision (be sure  to check it out!).This was one of my first childhood games, I can still remember certain stealth patterns to the levels. Really good to revisit from time to time and like I mentioned, mods really revitalise an old classic. JC Denton the badass! The question is, which ending did you choose?For those wondering, the storyline of the Deus Ex series is as follows;2027 – Human Revolution2029 – Mankind Divided2052 – Deus Ex2072 – Invisible WarSo the events of the original come AFTER the events of Human Revolution.

												Deus Ex has to be one of -the- best RPGs I've ever played. The 30-something-hour story is quite interesting and spans many different locations filled to the brim with things to discover and areas to explore. The dialogue does have its quirky moments where the recordings feel so off, but it does not impact the overall experience in any significant way. If anything, the corny lines and the questionable delivery of said lines only add to it. The music in this game just kicks♥♥♥♥♥and fits the mood perfectly. Deus Ex: Game of the Year Edition is most definitely worth your time and money. I don't care how much or little you're planning  to pay for it. Just get it, ok? :)			"

												What can I say about Deus Ex, it has some of the best story telling in any game ever, and you definitely won't find another game that gives you as many options to complete it the way you want to, it has a perfect mix of RPG elements, stealth, combat, plot twists, has A TON of alternate story lines, and a lot of really fun augmentations, basically you haven't played a good RPG until you've played this.Do not let the Unreal Engine 1 graphics scare you, also know that it has some wonky AI at times, and some really hilarious voice acting, but fear not, there is still more details in this game then several modern games today combined. Kinda sad really that in the 11 years since, nobody has managed to come close to its artistry, forget matching or surpassing this gem.			"

												FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, INSTALL A MAP PATCH BEFORE YOU PLAY THE GAME! The GOTY Edition has older editions of the maps due to an archiving error at Ion Storm. There is an unofficial patch to restore the maps to the correct versions which fixes many things. Without it, many pathways are missing, bugs unfixed, and an entire ending looks like crap.http://www.dxm.be/navigator.php5?lang=en&content=202Deus Ex was a pioneer in the action RPG genre. It manages to tell a great story without ever forcing the story in the way of gameplay. There's a few unoficial patches that let you run this game better on modern PC's. There's a lot of good mods for this game, which is really good.GAMEPLAY:Deus Ex's gameplay has aged a bit, although it's still very fun. Most notably, the game has a level of interactivity that has rarely been reached even by modern titles. The game isn't very linear, it more or less just nudges you in the right direction. The first few missions are kind of slow, so don't quit before you complete them. Pretty much all of the maps are large and expansive and have tons of items, enemies, and unique NPC's scattered around. There's a huge level of interactivity in the game world, which was a big selling point when this game came out. You have a variety of skills in the game that you can upgrade. You gain skill points by completing objectives or discovering hidden areas. You can also get ""augmentations"" to give your character new and unique abilities. Some people say that the shooting gameplay has aged - if that applies to you, remember to upgrade your weapon skills. It makes a huge difference.(You may want to install Shifter or Biomod to improve the gameplay, although I prefer the original.)PRESENTATION:The graphics weren't paticularly amazing for the time (they weren't bad, either), but it manages to use what they had to create a wonderful atmosphere. They depict many run-down decrepit buildings littered with homeless, sick people to show a country on the edge of collapse. The music is great and really adds to the atmosphere. Every location has it's own unique soundtrack that fits great and adapts to what you are currently doing. This game has full voice acting along with tons of unique characters, so the voice acting quality will vary. All main characters will have at least decent voice acting.(If you want to augment your graphics even further, install the D3D10 renderer and New Vision)STORY: (Don't worry, I'm not spoiling anything):Deus Ex takes place in a cyberpunk vision of the world where high-tech prosthetics and transhuman augmentations are commonplace. You are introduced to a memorable cast of characters. A great thing they do with their characters is that they take care in reminding you that they are still human beings and not just targets or objectives. It's all about uncovering ancient secrets and it's pretty cool in this aspect.Its story was great for the time - and even today it is rarely equaled in the philosophical depth it has. The gameplay was revolutionary, blending shooting and RPG elements. In summary, I'd definitely recommend this - it's a truly classic game.			"

Posted: September 16, 2014
												First of all, don't let the Steam game hours fool you. I am a 6 year veteran of the multiplayer of this game, and have completed (and replayed without completing) the single player multiple times. It was in early 2000 (2001-2002? Maybe later?) that I began playing this game. We had a 'Sold Out' retail copy of the game, it was rare to find the game elsewhere. I had multiple go's at the single player, somehow managed to complete it in my youth with the help of my father, and got curious about the multiplayer feature... in fact that was the most memorable thing for me, and I'm sure many people have already reviewed the story of the game, so instead I will share my long time multiplayer experiences with the game. Maybe someone will actually read through it and consider trying to host servers for this game, or bring friends in to start another population, who knows? Maybe even one of my many forgotten friends from Deus Ex back in the day will see this and remember me.I don't remember what player name I used starting out, I frankly don't think I even used a custom name... I just went under the many ""player"" variations. (Player5483, etc. It randomizes IIRC) Of course, I wasn't a good player, being a slow typer, younger with less reflexes (I had to be like, 5-6 years old or a little older at the time.) I was there to experience GODZ, Deja Vu's attacks on 0 aug servers, the move to MTL and Nepthy's (or whatever its name was)... everything. It wasn't until I went on Nobody's (That was his name) maps, an edit of Silo with a Stargate type of mutator active (I had no understanding of UnrealScript or mutators/mods in my younger age), that I got an actual username.There was a bar after teleporting, in which a Bartender NPC (said nothing, performed no functions) resided, standing still and blank. I decided that to better suit the atmosphere that I would bartend... getting my official username ""Bartender"". In that time I had played many modded servers for the pure sake of fun instead of competition, was even involved in a machinima recording with a great friend of mine back then, who I no longer have contact with. That same friend eventually got involved with a clan named DXC (Deus Ex Council, I think it was?), and I wanted to be a part of it with him. It was then that he said that they're looking for people who are ""good"" at the game. It frustrated me at the time, that he said I was not good enough to be in the same clan as he was. At the same time, that was what drove me to compete and practice, to eventually surpass him.After he had turned me away from the DXC thing, I joined up with RTK, otherwise known as Ready To Kill, a 0 augs (augmentation) clan focused on competition. It was there that I made many friends (Karkian, Maverick/Mustang, Killing Machine, Jima, and others), who taught me the tricks of 0 augs combat, being the tricks of movement to throw off the hitboxes, where to aim with an assault rifle/shotgun, leading and predicting player movement with a sniper rifle, and most of all... it gave me my headstart in to gaming. I've had good and bad days, I've went off on people who just clearly outclassed me that day, I've pulled off feats that people accused me of ""hax"" purely because I worked hard to develop that reflex/skill. I've seen players like Clix who just clearly dominate 0 augs who I could only wish that I'd be able to hold my own against. I've seen the mappers and modders make both fun maps and great fighting maps, which amazed me as a kid growing up... practicing my skills in this game for quite a few years.I did end up beating my close friend on most occurrances of him fighting me, he had left DXC by that time and made his own clan. I had been promoted multiple times for showings of skill, and it was a wild ride in the multiplayer world of Deus Ex for both of us. It was around 2005 family issues arrived (parents got divorced, was not doing well in elementary school due to issues back then... somewhat involving this game heheh), and I was not able to play as often. I had dropped out without much of a goodbye, got addicted to Runescape later, and dropped back in around 2008 just to find out that my favorite clan was dropping out of Deus Ex, and I couldn't find my friend anymore. It was then that I gave up Deus Ex, because the disc was undergoing major wear and tear, and the game had taken its toll on me in immense rage having warped my mind (I practiced on that game a LOT, and as a kid I had not developed the anger management skills to understand a loss in a videogame doesn't equate to any real life value loss).It is now 2014, the Gamespy servers for this game are shut down, effectively putting the final nail in Deus Ex's coffin, which was already becoming a dish only served cold. There are those among what remains of the Deus Ex Multiplayer (DXMP) community that are trying to host master servers to replace Gamespy, so that servers can be hosted once again. Do I think Deus Ex's multiplayer could return strong today? I don't know what to think, most people had started leaving Deus Ex after 2005... and all the servers on the master servers I've tried are empty. The good servers with interesting mutators/maps, whether RPG, botkilling or 0 augs/full augs... are gone. I'm afraid that DXMP is forever dead... and may it rest in peace as the biggest influence in my young gaming days. I only regret that now I have the technical interest to learn how to mod with UnrealScript and the unreal engine for Deus Ex and other games, to be too late to contribute anything before it croaked.In a nutshell, that's my 5-6 years history with this game in its multiplayer form, but since Gamespy's shut down its servers, multiplayer probably won't matter to all but the persistent. So, what about the single player? The single player back then was very good, it was a system in FPS that was new and different from how FPS's worked at the time. Now? I think people can still get something interesting from it, even in its age... but you might want to get some mods to tweak the graphics. I couldn't play Deus Ex any other way than how it was made to be honest, but some people can't stand looking at low poly counts. The story is cliche, but how it is all executed... I felt involved in something bigger than I could imagine, and I found that exciting. I don't know how active the modding community is, but I have heard of singleplayer big name mods coming out for this game... and I feel you should give this game a try if you like single player. I hope that one day multiplayer will make a comeback, but I think that it has finally ran its course.			"

NOTE: Since GameSpy was shut down, to continue multiplayer and to be able to see the servers, visit www.deusexnetwork.com with instructions on how to change the masterserver address.Deus Ex: Game of the Year Edition is a masterpiece. If you didn't play it yet - you definetly should.An exceptional mix of FPS / RPG / Stealth / Adventure. Took me 62 hours to get the whole 3 endings and still didn't get enough of it.You get to play as UNATCO (United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition) agent J.C. Denton. Not a simple agent, but an augmented bionic man. Find out betrayal, carefully choose who your friends and enemies are and, finally, decide the fate of the world.The game gives you freedom in everything. You don't get a Game Over except you get killed, throw yourself from a building, drink booze or do drugs till you overdose, or smoke cigarettes till you get cancer. Overwise it doesn't care what path you choose as long as you can survive the consequences. And there are choices to be made every instance. Use lockpicks to open a door or find a key for it, look for computer login info or use your computer skills to hack it, find acces codes for door keypads or use multitools to disable them, jump on your enemies and slaughter them the way you like it, or look for alternative ways, tunnels, air ventilation systems, etc, and avoid unnecessary kills. It's very rewarding also. A lot of augumentations to choose from, a big variety of weapons, ammo, tools, enemies, locations, etc, which will increasingly keep you interested in going through this cyberpunk conspiracy story.Proclaim yourself God, be part of The Illuminati, or plunge the world into another Dark Age. The choice is yours.			"

Warning: This review isn't augmented, but it wears sunglasses at night. It was written for the Steam Awards category ""Test of Time"" of which it was nominated for by this guy. You can blame its length entirely on that fact, and not on the fact that I'm too lazy to write a proper review for one of my favorite, if not favorite game. You've been warned.Deus Ex is perhaps the greatest video game ever made. And no, that isn't hyperbole, it really is that good. Deus Ex was one of the first games to have it all, from the graphics, which were beyond and above others of its time perhaps outside of No One Lives Forever (another fantastic game of ye olde), to the carefully crafted story and its branches -- allowing the player to make choices for themselves which aren't always clearcut ""good or bad"" as you'd have in other games, and have real consequences, as well as slow-but-steady, thoughtful gameplay that allowed you to truly feel in control as you decided how to act, lethally or unlethally, stealthily or in-your-face. Something that to this date, lots of games fail to do, even if they're privy enough to try it in the first place.Deus Ex holds up as a bastion of great design, a game that can be played many times, in different ways, and you'll likely still find out something you didn't know about it. It's a game so nostalgic that you can feel the nostalgia playing it for the first time. And then the second, and the third. It just keeps going. Playing Deus Ex isn't just playing a video game, it's committing to an illuminati ritual you'll be doing for the rest of your life, replaying every inch of the Statue of Liberty and the streets of Hong Kong until you're ready to do it again. Oh and it kinda sorta predicted 9/11, so there's that.If there's anything you can do is thank Ion Storm & John Romero for this masterpiece -- you could say in the end he did make us his wench. And do yourself a favor and pick up Deus Ex & Shifter Mod to treat yourself to a true blast from the past, just one more playthrough at a time.			"

Intelligent & challenging // Recommended for those looking to experience a classic+ Absolutely tons of customization options; with such variety, few people can really boast that they have played the same game twice+ Narrative is both mature and showcases an impressive amount of depth+ Augmentations, also, offer great freedom in character tailoring; some are arguably more useful than others, but overall the sense of freedom inherent in this mechanic does well to complement the same freedom found throughout the rest of the game+ Modular damage; limbs and body parts experience damage separately, and this translates competently to gameplay (eg. taking too much damage in a leg will result in poor movement)+ The player is offered spectacular freedom in how level objectives and advancement are to be handled+ Level design is applaudable; everything flows well from one area to another, and layouts are generally sensible+ Soundtrack is absolutely fantastic; sets the mood, doesn't necessarily distract, and stays with you when the game is off+ Dialogue and writing is absolutely superb; this is easily one of the better aspects of the game, and it presents well even today- Speed/compatibility issue; this may not affect everyone, but there is an issue with compatibility on modern machines which causes overall gamespeed to increase drastically (there is a workaround, but it's something of a hassle to fix)- Visuals and animations really show their age; these don't hold up well today, but it's not bad enough to detract from the overall experience- Voice-acting, though it can be quite good, is a mostly underwhelming effort; some voice actors go as far as to be terribleLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												This game is like a box of your favorite cereal: you might have accidentally left it open in the cabinet and forgot about it for  a couple of weeks, but after you pour another bowl of it, it still tastes great.I say that because this game is outdated, cripplingly so in certain regards.  The enemy guard AI has a field of view that can be equated to holding two paper towel rolls up to your eyes.  If they spot you, you can trolley out of sight, and they won't come investigate.  The AI doesn't noticeably improve as you progress further into the game (it's especially jarring because the guards you come across look like menacing and dangerous, but it's like they forgot their prescription glasses at home), and instead the game relies on subsidizing the amount of cheese tactics you can perform (by the end of the game, some of the enemies can only be taken out by a soft spot on their back using the cattle prod).  The controls are beyond archaic, and I don't think they even made sense back when they were conceived in 1999 (you use the + button on the number pad to quicksave).  The resolution does not appear to surpass 480p without getting yourself one of the many mods this game has to make it playable in the days of DirectX12.  The general quality of the game (from a presentation perspective) is so bad it's legendary.How's the actual meat of the game?  Well, the story is serviceable.  It's beautifuly timeless due to its themes of how far are we willing to give the government control over our lives to protect us from terrorism, and whether or not the government might get carried away in abusing their power.  This game was released before 9/11 and world paranoid about terrorism, but not so early before that society was wildly different.  There really isn't a lot of character development; a character starts and ends the game acting similarly (you could argue the protagonist, JC Denton, gets development, but he could act wildly depending on your actions).  With that said, the people you meet along the journey become good guys or bad guys solely depending on your opinion of them (for example, is Paul Denton justified in wanting to treat being a UNATCO agent like a day on the police force, or is he just being a blind hippy by not wanting to kill some ♥♥♥♥ing ragheads (or this game's French equivalent, the NSF).Gameplay wise, the primitive AI doesn't really lend itself to any tense gameplay you might see in other stealth games like the Arkham games, Metal Gear Solid, or successors like Dishonored.  The stealth approach is just as valid as the loud approach, and it's not impossible to adjust depending on your supply reserves (save your cattle prods, kids).  You get skill points by doing objectives.  They improve your general skills (though they're not impossible to use without the said skills).  Don't put skill points in Swimming.  This game carves out its niche with its use of the nano augmentations.  As you progress through the story, you'll get the choice to augment yourself by choosing one of the two options you're given (e.g. you can choose to augment your feet to move quicker, or to move quietly).The game really shines through with its level designs.  If you dedicate the time to explore the levels, you start to realize that there is no one way to approach a situation, and there are areas you could easily miss which houses a ton of augment upgrades, supplies, or even some weapon modifications.  You might want to invade a park through the front door, being caught immediately and blasted down, or you could survey the park, and find a back door that's loosely guarded, and housing your true objective much sooner.  Which objective is best?  Well, you get to your target either way, and that's all that matters.  The first path to the objective might not be the best route for you if you want to want to pick people off, but somebody who wants to toss a tear gas grenade in and then take down the group would already be stroking their boner at the opportunity.This is why I recommend Deus Ex.  Nonlinear stealth is tough to pull of meaningfully (looking at you Metal Gear Solid V).  This game blends together talking with civilians to learn how to get your best edge, to watching your step so that you don't get caught by the bad guys.  You can try to bypass an electronic grid by using a multitool, or by just looking for a route to bypass the grid.  It's a game where the only reason your choice matters is for what you had to do to do it.Final Words: ""A bomb's a bad choice for close-range combat.""			"

												Whoa, what a game. Here's a review from someone who's NEVER played the game before a week ago, and I have to say it's still worthy of all the praise it gets from the long-time fans around here.In short:Good+ Biggest plus is the story, still relevant maybe even more so today.+ Took me over 30 hours to beat on Normal difficulty and only 1 ending.+ Gameplay. Surpringly smooth platforming and stealth mechanics. Feels good to change playstyles.+ Best level design in a single player FPS I might have ever seen. Lots of places to explore and secrets to find for an FPS, even by todays standard.+ Figuring out certain problems actually requires you to use your brain instead of quest arrows pointing the way you have to go and telling you exactly what you have to do.+ Completing objectives the way you want to feels AWESOME. You really feel satisfied after completing a mission.+ Even though the graphics have aged, the voice-acting and sound-effects are still great! (explosions are LOUD) A bit quirky and stereotypical at times, but still endearing and engaging. It really grew on me after a while.Not-So-Good:- Controls might be too complex if you're not used to old single player games with lots of buttons and menus. I got used to it though.- Certain sections might be frustrating. Be prepared to die a lot to find out exactly what to do or what path to take for optimal survival.- The graphics haven't aged great and you need to get used to it before you start to see all the details like what grates you can or can't open, which buttons to push etc. etc.- Personally not a fan of some of the RPG-elements. You shoot guns as if you're drunk with parkinsons in the early game.- You might want to play through it in one go because of the crazy storyline, but the game is LONG so you're forced to take your time with this game. Might actually be a good thing though! Expect it to be far easier after your first playthrough though.So basically Deus Ex is a fantastic game for any one who enjoys single-player, story-driven games and can overlook some of the elements that haven't aged well. There is enough action for any FPS lover so I recommend it to any one who has enjoyed games like Half-Life 2 or the more recent Fallout games. So put this game on your wishlist and buy it ASAP! This truly is one of the classics every video game fanatic should have played at least once!			"

												Deus Ex, the one and only. Its basic concept rooted back to the System Shock titles, but, the way I see it, Deus Ex is more refined, and have a ton of originality on its own.When I just finished it again recently, I wrote a big, sky-high praise to this game, for being so cool, that it is still unmatched, even with all new Deus Ex games, Ken Levine stuff and so on. This text is more clear-viewed edition - however, it is still far from usual pro/contra weighted review.Mostly, my admiration about the first Deus Ex is based on the passion to cyberpunk background in general. As, for some reasons, the most of the modern games bearing this tag, are not really worth that -punk suffix, which itself is too hyped at moment, with cadavers like diesel-punk, or even worse, blues-punk or something. Now, I don't really want to dive deeper in all that, but I'll state it like this: while the original Deus Ex is certainly a cyberpunk story, the newer additions - aren't. They're close, sure. We have basic ""hi tech, low life"" scenery all around - but the bottom line behind it, the feelings those newer installations are calling upon - are not of the -punk world. Or maybe it is corporations point of view on the cyberpunk world, and not its dweller's, which is more close to mine.There are still producing some games with that original CyberP fleur - like Shadowrun games, for instance. But, again, in case of the first Deus Ex, the result is more refined and pure, especially in the aftertaste.Now, with all those quasi-philosophy intro words said, let's settle the main question - is the game worth playing?With all those passed years - and visuals were not top-notch even in the year 2000, so now, after more than 15 years, they surely can take away many possible players. But that can be dealt with - at some degree, at least. Check DeusEx graphics fixes in the web, there are some good tweaks about it. However, even with enhanced graphics, there's still a big question of gameplay adaptability - or how else would you call a problem of modern players physically and especially mentally unable to play old games. The mechanics were different then. The level of expectations - from players to game designers, and vise versa - was much different as well.So, the simple answer of ""should you play it now"" is - ""yes, you can try it, but no guarantee"". One thing that is certain, however, is that ""youtube playthrough"" will not give you even the quarter of it's real depth and coolness. Deus Ex is all about multiplexity of choices. Not some scripted ""morale choice"", which happens from time to time, with pre-programmed consequences. Now, I'm talking about open-world freedom of what to do, in the given circumstances.And that's where I'm back on the philosophy railings again. All those freedom of choices, isn't just about ""kill or be killed"", as it goes with 90% of videogames around. The choices you're gonna make if you'll start Deus Ex - are off the usual borders of ""good"" and ""bad"". They're beyond Kant's dogma or some ""golden rules"" - all that is not working in the post-industrial and post-human world that we see in the Deus Ex.So, there it goes - the legend of the game design, released when the average part of today-players was not yet ready to play. It is the monument, one of the pillars gamedesign are based upon now - just like Doom or Diablo. Sadly, but unlike those titles, there are still no good enough projects that surpassed it's glory, with newer and better technology and overall greatness.So, mark is 10/10, but is it recommended? Only for the most strong-willed species around. No crutches included.			"

												Pretty much objectively one of the best games of all time. Nearly every aspect of this game has aged very well. The plot is engaging and intelligent. The gameplay allows you to approach nearly any situation in nearly any way you wish and the levels are so damn big and well designed that you will often find all sorts of alternate ways to do things each time you play. For that matter there are so many little things and side missions you can find in the game that it is almost always worth exploring everywhere that you can. Not to mention that the game WILL reward you for exploring. Building a character is so much fun and there are so many things that you can specialize in and it will change the way you play the game in very significant ways. The story is very malleable and you can pretty much do anything you want and rather then giving you a ""MISSION FAILED"" thing when you kill a story important character the game will mold to your actions. The Music is awesome and really captures the atmosphere of the game.Pretty much the only two things I could imagine somebody objecting to would be the graphics and voice acting. Which sure, I mean the graphics ARE pretty ugly but if such an old game having bad graphics bothers you so much then you can easily download some graphics mods to make the game much more paletable for you. (As a side note this game has a pretty decent modding community you should check out.)And while the voice acting can be pretty bad it (thankfully) is the funny kind of bad so you shouldnt be bothered too much by it.

												For me, the best game ever made.Origionally played a pirate copy when it was first released back in 2000 just for something to do one night. I've then gone on to purchase the game maybe 3-4 times. Completed the game so many times with every ending possible and I even have the soundtrack to the game on my phone. I can't remember the last game ive actually wanted to complete recently let alone several times. The story line is absolutely fantastic, something games developers just dont seem to spend time on these days *cough* Destiny *cough* ...but also, the sheer volume in detail, there are so many hidden extras...like the Majestic 12 base hidden in the sewers in NYC. Modern games would have shipped that as DLC and it took me 3-4 play throughs to discover it.One of the first games to offer a non linear play through, it gave you options on different ways to storm a building and even tested your morality by giving you the choice to kill or spare. I remember being amazed by being told off by your in game boss for going in the girls toilets for a quick sniff around, who would bother to code little things in like that these days?Graphics are terrible now I admit, but pick yourself up a HD pack along with a copy of xpadder for joypad use and you'll quickly discover just how much you've been ripped off the last time you spunked 40-50 bucks on the latest console game.

												Possibly the best PC game of all time.Even 16 years after this game's release, we have not seen any game that even comes close to Deus Ex. There's no game that indulges into subjects like human nature, government, religion, technology, and ethics. No other game has the replayability this one has, with multiple playstyles, pathways, and secrets.You would expect games to have advanced from this and learned from it, but as time goes on it seems like a relic from a bygone age, a time when player choice mattered, story mattered, theme mattered, instead of profit margin being king. EDIT:For those Linux/Mac users hesitant to pick up this game I have good news: It works perfectly on Wine. I've been running it on my Mac for a few months now and haven't had any crashes.EDIT 2: Updating this review for the 'cheevo. This game should win the ""Test of Time award"", hands-down the best game ever. Remember, every time it's mentioned someone reinstalls.There is no reason why anyone should not play this game.			"

												tl;dr Do yourself a favor and buy this game if you're even slightly interested. Absolutely incredible game. Timeless level design and story, GOAT imo Overview Deus Ex is a classic FPS/RPG from the year 2000, but it manages to offer more player choice and better level design than most games today. The story also manages to stay compelling and creates a sense of tension as you uncover a massive international conspiracy.  Gameplay tl;dr for gameplay: loads of choice and neat weapons plus the signature augmentation system, offers a lot of replayability even if the gunplay and melee are weak by modern standardsDeus Ex plays like traditional stealth games from the late 90s with RPG and FPS elements. It has some odd controls that may take some getting used to for those of you more used to modern games, but keys are fully rebindable. Deus Ex offers a massive range of weapons and tools to help you through levels, from tranquilizer crossbows and 10mm pistols to sawed-off shotguns, snipers and an energy sword. If you wish, you can finish the game without killing any enemies and silently strike from the shadows with your trusty baton or riot prod, or you may choose to assault your enemies with shotguns and rocket launchers. Deus Ex is all about choice. The signature feature of Deus Ex is the Augmentation system. Throughout the game, you find canisters that, when installed with a medical bot, give you a choice of a new power. This may be an invisibility cloak, health regeneration, stronger melee attacks, ballistic protection, etc. These drain bioelectric power, which may be refilled with biocells or a repair bot. You can also find augmentation upgrade canisters that let you upgrade your existing augs (less energy consumption, new perks, etc). Health is also an important system, as each body part has its own health bar. For example, if you lose all health on your legs, you lose your legs and crawl around until you heal them with a medkit or Regen aug. Lose all health in your chest or head, however, and you will die. Deus Ex also has a skilled system. Each major gameplay function has a skill associated with it that has four ranks (Untrained, Trained, Advanced, and Master). Each rank increases your proficiency in that area. You automatically start with Trained Pistol skill from the outset. Upgrading your skill in a weapon skill (Low-Tech, Pistols, Rifles, Heavy) increases your damage and accuracy with that weapon type with each rank you take and in the case of Heavy lets you move faster with said weapon equipped. Upgrading your Electronics or Lockpick skills decreases the number of multitools or lockpicks required to hack defense systems (cameras, laser grids) or open doors. Computer skill controls how much time you have to hack a computer terminal and access emails, security controls, etc. The list goes on and on. Weapon mods exist in Deus Ex, too. Silencers obviously make weapons quieter and more effective for stealth purposes, laser sights negate the need to line up a shot for max accuracy, scopes let you fire accurately from a distance, recoil and accuracy mods affect those traits respectively, clip mods add ammo to your magazine, etc. etc. etc. Beware of adding a scope and a laser sight to a weapon, however, because having a scope installed negates the laser sight's accuracy bonus for whatever reason. This does not apply to sniper rifles, however. Almost every weapon has multiple ammo types. For example, the minicrossbow has lethal darts, tranquilizers, and flare darts. The assault rifle has an underbarrel grenade launcher, the shotguns have buckshot rounds for organic targets and Sabot rounds for armor-piercing (security bots, etc), and so on. As far as actual combat goes, the gunplay and melee gameplay are very weak and unsatisfying overall thanks to iffy hitboxes and unsatisfying animations, but that's more of a limitation of the time the game was made at. Again, the combat is defined by augmentations and creative combinations. Overall, the gameplay holds up to modern standards in terms of creativity with items and the unique augmentation system, but the gunplay and melee combat is weak thanks to it being a very old game. Loads of choice and replayability offered by the augmentation system, weapons, and skills.  Story  For a fifteen-year-old game, Deus Ex has an amazing globetrotting story revolving around conspiracies in a world ravaged by a plague. Deus Ex contains many exotic locations and memorable characters to assist you (or fight you) along the way. I would rather not spoil too much of the story or locations, but I will say that your choices do matter and some will come into play later in the game than you would expect. I don't know what else to say about it without spoiling, but it's a crazy story with plenty of twists and turns along the way.  Design I feel like Ion Storm got the 2050s cyberpunk aesthetic right. It mixes the current world at the time with their vision of the future. Plenty of neon lights, futuristic weapon designs and armor, hologram communications, etc. Even though this game is 15 years old, it manages to be immersive with its very natural-feeling level design. The excellent visual mods New Vision and HDTP also do wonders and I would highly recommend them. But back to the level design; it's quite amazing how much work went into the levels. Each hub area or level is tailored for any playstyle you could have. They made it feasible to complete the game with perfect stealth and no kills, melee only, full-on combat, or just hacking security systems to mow down enemies with turrets at your disposal. This adds even more to the replayability, knowing that the game will never force you into any particular playstyle.  Conclusion As someone who played Deus Ex for the first time this year and just finished it, I feel that Deus Ex is a masterpiece. It gets everything right where it counts, and its only real weakness in my opinion is the dated combat. The level design and player freedom combined with the story more than make up for it, though. I strongly believe today, as I write this, that Deus Ex is the best game ever made, hands down. I love Ocarina of Time, Half-Life 2, all the usual suspects, but this is really a special game that every RPG/stealth/FPS fan owes it to themself to play. I got it in the 2014 autumn sale for $1.74 USD, and it's absolutely incredible value. Even at the current full price of $6.99 it's well worth it. I'd rate Deus Ex a 10/10. Masterful, timeless game. The only thing that could make this game better would be a from the ground up remake with modern visuals, mechanics, etc. You owe it to yourself to play this game if you're even slightly interested in Deus Ex.

												Year 2000, Microsoft release a videogame for windows, named Deus Ex... And now, 14 years later, im making this review. The review of one of the best games i´ve ever had the chance to play, and personally, the summit of videogames.Deus Ex has a cyberpunk hue, which is a subgenre of SCI-FI in a near future (specifically in the 2052) such as Blade Runner, Matrix o The Sprawl Trilogy of William Gibson. Also is an acction videogame stapled with Rpg mechanics, adventure and Simulation. With all these traits, Deus Ex gives you the chance of make profit of your own skills, there are a lot of ways to achieve your goal during a quest. Despite of the fact that there are 4 genres of videogames taking part in this game (rpg-fps-adventure-simulation) the gameplay is just hilarious, and all this because these 4 elements are so well coordinated that you get over the prejudice of having ""gameplay issues due to the quantity of the genres"", just attending the story and the characters.In addition to this, as we accomplish goals we will be rewarded with ""skill points"", these are used to enhance our skills in different ways, moreover we can improve our weapons with a wide variety of ""Weapon modifications"".We assume the role of Denton. J.C. Denton is an special agent under the orders of U.N.A.T.C.O. (United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition) with nanotech-augmentations. As we fathom into the world of Deus Ex, we will discover that the society has been splitted by the differences between ""augmens"" and people who cannot pay them, the illnesses and the expensive heals, and of course, between goverment and people. As the plot unfolds, JC will face organizations like Illuminati, Templars or Hong-Kong Tryads.And what about the OST? Well if they Succeeded with a 4stylegenres-mixture in the videogame...why not mix musical genres too? Its just amazing how this music complement the game with a gorgeous melody made with Techno, Jazz and Classical music. Just check it on your own here.Personally, and as i said in the top of this review, for me this game is the Pinacle, the summit of videogames. I still playing this game, and yet i keep finding new resources to achieve my goals in the game, just amazing..And sorry if i made any mistake, i just woke up and i had to write this. :mortis:			"

												And I wondered why people praised this game so much, well, now I know why.My first Deus Ex game was Human Revolution and it became one of my favorite games. With that said I never got to play the original Deus Ex until now and I can finally say my life is complete.How can a game from 2000 be so advanced for its time? The presentation, the narrative, the characters. the enviroment, the music, all the little details. All of this makes Deus Ex not only a great game but a masterpiece.And I almost forgot about the gameplay... I would say that it is the most important and the most refined aspect from the game, it's what it makes Deus Ex. Sneaking behind a guard and knocking him down silently, finding new paths through the ventilation vents, upgrading yourself and using augmentations, all of it is worth it.Before I considered DXHR to be one of my favorite games(and I still do) but now that I've played the original I can see how HR turned out so great.THE CONSPIRACY IS REAL!

												The genius of this game is still unsurpassed to this day, not even the future sequels as good as they are match this games genius. Warren Spector truly captured the Cyberpunk genre perfectly along with a good concept of asking ""What if all the conspiracies are true?"" it's the most immersive FPS/RPG hybrid you'll ever play. Do I recommend? Steam why the hell would ask such a dumb question?			"

												Just the fact that I'm writing a review is evidence of how good this game was, as I rarely bother with reviews. This game was worth it, however.Old, blocky graphics usually deter me from even considering a game since I'm a very visual type person, but the plotline and heavy, detailed dialogue made me quickly take back any complaints. As a person whose first Deus Ex game was Human Revolution (played in 2015, no less), the original game still managed to make me feel nostalgic. I even grew FOND of all those low resolution textures about halfway through the game.Game of the year, and for good reason. Where Deus Ex lacks in visuals, it provides in storytelling, character interaction, variety, the freedom of choice, loads of the unexpected, and a rad as hell soundtrack. Not to mention how thorough the developers were with filling in just about every single voice line and detail they could no matter what kind of tricks you tried to pull in the game. Simply amazing, and the very opposite of linear. Play through the game 10 times, you'll keep finding secrets and surprises.Get it. Play it. You won't regret it, even 16 years after its release.And remember, stick with the prod!			"

												I should be mad at Deus Ex for lying to me.  The game showed me the incredible potential video games had, to combine genres and transcend the genre, and promised me that the best was yet to come.  Well, it wasn't.  Deus Ex was the best, and the future is still trying to love up to that promise.  Sure, a few games here and there come close (VtM - Bloodlines, Human Revolution) but they never quite reached that little extra, that little dose of genius and obsession, that elevated Deus Ex to one of the greatest games of all time.

												82 hours...sheesh! (and counting,imma atleast have 1000 hours by end of year)So,let me explain a few thing before we dwelve into the review,mmkay?This game is an elderly piece,espically since it came out start of second millenia (in gaming years anything 5+ years is elderly).So you will expect issues if you're not used to millenia age game (i.e right mouse button is use instead of ""e"" or etc.).Easily fixable in keyboard and mouse settings,so your modern age controls are there :).Although,this is clunky and glitchy on modern systems (download New Vision mod instead of Revision ((TRUST ME)) ).So how's the game?Damn good! The story is rough to get into from the first mission,the introduction will confuse you,but you will understand everything by fourth mission.JC Denton has no emotion,but that's the player,he's suppost to represent YOU! It dosesn't break immersion as you (suprising for a anicent game).Summary of the plot?You're JC Denton,or whatever you picked your name as,but you will be always called JC Denton.JC is a starter for  U.N.A.T.C.O (United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition Operations) based in Liberty Island.JC is an nano-augmented agent,the prototype per say for the new generation of augmentations,your brother Paul is also augmented like you.You can see the diffrence between generations,as Agent Navarre and Agent Hermann are mechanically augmented (you will meet them in UNATCO Headquaters).So what is UNATCO's job? Their job is to protect and distribute the vaccine Ambrosia,manufactured by VersaLife,due to a massive plague,known as ""Grey Death"".Thing is,a domestic terrorist group known as ""N.S.F"" (National Secessionist Federation,they want to seced from the Union) keep stealing the shipments.As the best duo for the job,you and your brother are signed to deal with these missing shipments,but something seems off about your brother.As you get deeper to the roots about the NSF,your brother uncovers a massive conspiracy involving an secret society called ""Majestic 12"" who is possibly behind the dystopia that has ravashed the world and even the ""Grey Death"".Gameplay?Gameplay is an FPS/RPG hybrid with an optional stealth mechanics (IMO,stealth for advanced players).You have your skills and augmentations,now you can't get every skill mastered and every augmentation available,you have to decide on the skills and augmentations you want for your playthrough (I.E skills:Lockpicking,Electronics;Augs:Regeneration,Cloak).So it makes it very interesting on how you choose,and makes multiple playthroughs possible by learning about diffrent augmentations to use.As for the maps,they look small,but in turn they are very big when it calls for the little nooks and crannies that are in the map,play again to find that recoil upgrade!Graphics? The game looks old,still up to date?*sigh*The game runs on a modified Unreal Engine 1 engine.Of course it looks dated,but the New Vision mod helps by adding new textures to certain things that needs visual upgrades (avoiding the Revision mod).I've gotten past everything by focusing more on gameplay and story.Worth it?Oh yes,definetly! This game is worth multiple playthroughs,due to being so big and complex! I'm on my whatever number playthrough.Absolutley worth the very cheap purchase!Multiplayer? Mods?Gamespy shut down the multiplayer back in 2014,but a community-made patch has fixed this and it is better than ever!As for mods,there is mod support,but I have no clue on the current state of that,only ones I know that were popular was Nameless Mod and Malkovian.So don't expect and total skyrim-esque mods.Cujo's 5 Step Rating™?Story- 5/5(Top Notch Legit) - Very well thought of,very deep,and very hooking!Gameplay- 4/5(Bootyful) - Can be clunky at times,but only if you don't choose skills to your play style.Graphics - 2.5/5(Okay?) - 4/5 if it were 2000 - Graphics take a hit,but for me,doesn't affect the gameAudio - 3.5/5(Almost Bootyful) - 5/5 if it were 2000 - Soundtrack is excellent! A favorite of mine is ""Enemy Within""Atmosphere - 5/5(Top Notch Legit) - Very dark and gritty,that is what you want when you have a game with this kind of story.Overall - 4/5 (Bootyful)- A masterpiece,for the time it came out,and a legend in the PC gaming world.Would definitly recommend to anyone who needs something to satisfy them for quite a few hours! (My best game of all time in my book ^_^) "

												- Your appointment with FEMA should be finalized within the week.

When I mentioned we could put him on the priority list for the Ambrosia vaccine, he was so willing it was almost pathetic.- This plague... the rioting is intensifying to the point where we may not be able to contain it.- Why contain it? Let it spill over the schools and churches, let the bodies pile up in the streets. In the end they'll beg us to save them.- I've received reports of armed attacks on shipments. There's not enough vaccine to go around, and the underclasses are starting to get - Of course they're desperate; they can smell their deaths, and the sound they'll make rattling their cages will serve as a warning to the rest.- Mmm. I hope you're not underestimating the problem. Intelligence suggest they're behind the problems in Paris.- Bunch of pretentious old men playing at running the world. But the world left them behind long ago. We are the future.- We have other problems.- UNATCO?- Formed by executive order after the strike on the Statue. I have someone in place though. I'm more concerned about Savage. He's relocated to Vandenberg.- Our biochem corpus is far in advance of theirs, as is our electronic sentience, and their 'ethical inflexibility' has allowed us to make progress in areas they refuse to - The augmentation project?- Among others. But, I must admit, I've been somewhat disappointed with the performance of the primary unit.- The secondary unit should be online soon. It's currently undergoing preparations and should be operational within six months. If necessary, the primary will be terminated.- We've had to endure much, you and I, but soon there will be order again. A new age.

Short version: 93%Deus Ex is an old game, but still among the best cRPGs you can find. It offers a wide variety of options and choices, which are supported by a complex and conspiracy-heavy storyline keeping up your interest. Just don’t forget to get the community-created patches to make the engine compatible with modern video cards.Long version:The internet likes lists, especially if they want to collect the best of all times in a specific category. If you find one about the best cRPGs, you’ll more than likely see Deus Ex near the top of that lists, and for good reason.The gameplay is all about freedom. Freedom in play style: you can take out your enemies in lethal and non-lethal ways (you can finish the whole game with only taking one life), or you can sneak past them using cover, or create a diversion (throw an object, hack security, or even blow something up). You can rely on your wits, your items or your special augmentations, which– like magic in fantasy games– let you do supernatural feats as long as your energy levels remain.There is also a freedom in the story. Almost all goal can be reached in at least three different ways; all of the maps include several hidden spots and secret routes that lead you to shortcuts, additional rewards or sometimes even new secondary goals. And to make the list complete, you can choose among different endings for the story, which is something that even some of the best RPGs out there couldn't tell about themselves.The game was made on arguably the best engine of its time, Unreal, which really shines in night scenes. (Pardon me the oxymoron.) This not only creates a very fitting atmosphere, but it's also integrated into the game: there are plenty of dark corners to hide – and that’s another reason why Deus Ex is often compared to another successful FPS/sneak hybrid, the Thief series.The plot itself is an amalgam of all modern conspiracy theories ranging from the little grey people of Area 51 to the Illuminati and government-controlled epidemics. Still, it’s a very complex story with a lots of questions regarding human nature and sociology. And if we add in the excellent and memorable soundtrack, it's easy to understand why this game is still ranked so high even to this day.			"

												This is, and always will be, one of the best and most revolutionary games of all time. It is one of many places where I need to call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on metascore, because it deserves more than 90. I would not go as far as to say it deserves a full ace, but about 96-97? Sure. Back when it came out, it was the biggest deal. Sure, Half-life laid the foundation for FPS games, but this game is no mere FPS. It is an RPG, and an excellent one at that. Comparing it to other old-school RPGs, it would always come out on top for me.The best feature of this game is, it does not stop you from finding your own solutions to problems. Say there is a laser tripwire that sets of an alarm. You can solve this problem in so many different ways. You can run through and shoot your way through. You can hack the control panel. You can find one of usually at least two ways around it. Or, alternatively, you can stack up some boxes and jump over it. The game will not stop you. Also, everything you do actually matters. It matters if you go lethal or peaceful, it matters if you talk to people or not, it matters if you explore and it affects the game, and the story. It is up to this day, one of the most sublime non-linear RPGs on the market. The story is very good, provided you are into conspiracy theories. The hero, JC Denton will struggle with or against UNATCO, the UN, US government, NSF and even the Illuminati. To avoid spoilers, I will just say that the conception is just fantastic, but you need to experience it yourself. The graphics don't hold up today, unfortunately, but a true connesieur will be able to look past that, as lack of graphical fidelity is the case with many games of the past age. The soundtrack makes up for it, though. This is one of many cases where music from a game is a real piece of art.You would do yourself a great service if you bought this game and played it to completion. It bears the name of a classic with pride, and does not disappoint. After a little bit of tinkering it will run at 1080p, and the controls are fully customizable, so you should make do with those somewhat clunky mechanics.It is really that good. And dirt cheap too. Take my word, and pick it up.Deus Ex gets my 0451/10			"

												I played through this game fully back in the day when it originally launched, and I lost myself in it. Whilst the game hasn't aged well visually, and the voice acting is terrible, the amount of freedom afforded to the player to make decisions is still impressive. The feeling of reactivity and decision on the player is quite exhilerating, especially as the game goes on and decisions have further reaching impact.The opening can feel clumsy, but as you realise how immersive the level of reaction can be, and the opportunities you have to make meaningful decisions, the game really comes to life. The endings lack a little impact due to how they are presented, but the journey to making those decisions is worth the investment, the game is a true classic. It's a shame most games since have focused more on narrative and mechanics as separate elements, rather than blending decisions into meaningful influences on the game (as an aside, I think the closest to achieve this other than Deus Ex is Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines).Whilst Deus Ex: Human Revolution never lived up to the freedom and openness and impact that the original set in place, the two slot together beautfully lore-wise, so if you've played one and not the other, I'd highly recommend them both.

												The game is undoubtedly a good one. I feel like I would have loved it more if I had played it back in 2000 instead of 2014. By now, I must view it as a retro-style game, and because of that I felt like I had to rush through this game in order to play the next two in the series.All in all, the plot was a bit convoluted, but by no means bad. It was dark and gritty enough to keep me interested to see what happens in the end. However, the ending was a bit disappointing since I had expected a lot more movie/cinematics. That's what I get for applying 2014-standards to a 2000-game.I think to rate this game fairly, I should give it a 8/10 at least. The sheer number of ways to get through the levels alone can qualify the game for a GOTY status since it allows the player to try numerous methods to accomplish the goals.The music was very good, surprisingly, and I think it definitely caught my attention so that I would feel more immersed in the cyberpunk environment of Deus Ex.Overall, I'd give the game a 8/10. I wish I could have enjoyed it more, but I found this gem of a game too late in my life, and I'm sorry that I missed out a little on how much fun it could have been. Hopefully, the reader of this review can take the game slow and enjoy all that it has to offer.			"

												Every time you mention the blessed words ""Deus Ex"", someone reinstalls it. With good reasons, too. This game is absolutely phenomenal. The levels are huge and varied, from New York to Paris, to Area 51, to my personal favorite Hong Kong. The game is designed around player agency. You not only get to manipulate what happens in the plot, but there are tons of different weapons, augmentations, and skills. The huge levels each have multiple paths in them based on all of these different possible combinations, and since you cannot get every augment (If you even find an augmentation canister you can only choose 1 of 2) or upgrade everything, there is a high amount of replayability which does not get old. It is sad that a game from 16 years ago is more complex and interesting than the majority of releases today. Deus Ex is a hugely influential game and deserves its place as at least one of if not the greatest PC game of all time.			"

												Timeless classic and a game that brings nostalgia. Considered by many to be the best PC game ever made with it's amazing storyline. Made in times when storyline was important (if not the most important) part of game development. Graphics today can only make a smile on your face but remember this game is 17 years old and was considered ""beautiful"" in 2000. I've been returning to this title so many times - for fun, with cheats or just to see the story again, every time discovering something that I didn't in previous run and I hope it will be the same today. The only downside is poor AI, enemies don't see you sometimes even if you stand with them face to face. Sadly multiplayer is dead since gamespy shut down their servers.  I have a small wish that someday it will be remastered but likely it will never happen.			"

												One of the best games released, and certainly the best in Deus Ex series (following games are quite pathetic in comparison). Great story, atmosphere, dialogues, gameplay (non-violent playthrough totally possible, including avoiding bosses), and probably the only game of this kind that is so good. I recommend it to cRPG players, to FPS players and to stealth games players as the gameplay will higly depend on the player. The only thing I dislike in Deus Ex are some quite crappy levels where it's easy to get lost even on a tiny map, but it's only about some of the levels, most are alright. It's a classic that you ought to play. You might want to skip other games in the series. The first Deus Ex is the only one that matters, and so far there is no other game that might compare with it.			"

												A game based around choice, it ends up being a must for anyone who enjoys fps/rpg hybrids, realistic difficulty modes, good stories or cyberpunk. Come in ready to think as much as act, and you'll enjoy this game.That aside, the game's main issue is the age that shows through it, namely the amount of reused models that are visibly re-purposed character by character through reskin.Thankfully if you have issues with that there are a plethora of mods to deal with the visuals.It would be advisable to modify it to run in widescreen regardless of your lean towards or against remastery.http://kentie.net/article/dxguide/For extra visual splendor you might wish to try the New Vision mod, which replaces every single texture in the game.http://www.moddb.com/mods/new-visionAnd finally, at the end of the day you may wish to try a new gameplay experience when you're done with the game once or twice.

												Deus Ex has to be one of greatest games of the 2000s. Deus Ex was a fantastic games from developers who were not that good at the time. It's a genre defining classic. Well okay, the graphics might not be the greatest, the gun play is really bad, and the AI really acts like blind maniacs. But the idea and concept of the game was truly uncomparible to any other game at the time. One of the greatest aspect of the game is the writing. Pretty alright voice actors and you can choose what kind of sentence you want to say to a person and that can affect the game. If you do something to character, like walk into the womens bathroom, they will remember that and will mention it and even my boss told me about it. The controls are extremely clunky for todays standards and there are also a crazy amount of keys. Not very user friendly for todays standards. If these controls came out in a game in this day and age, it would spark up some controversy with some.The health was also like no other. You have health bars for your head, torso, left and right leg, and left and right arm. This can really affect your gameplay if you've damaged a part in your body. If you damaged you leg, you would start limping. Augmentations are also really interesting. You can get a augmentation for turing invisible! I wished that seriously every game had that ability. While I was playing, but you can't swap out these augmentations for other ones, so you have to be careful with what you are sure you are getting. Now lets talk about the soundtrack. The soundtrack is very well composed and the person who made the soundtrack also made songs for the Unreal series. Look, this game isn't for everyone. Some people will like this and some people not. When first playing the game, I found it one of the most confusing games that I've ever played and I didn't really enjoy it. Would I recommend this game today? Yes, if you arn't too bothered by the graphics. As for the sequel, NO! Never play it. It's as if the developers didn't know this game was going to be this great and they tried too hard to do the same thing again. I can't wait for Deus Ex: Mankind Devided. 10/10			"

												It's the Greatest PC Game of All Time. It says so on the box, I swear! If it doesn't, ask anyone who's left Liberty Island. They'll tell you so.Incredible gameplay, with an interesting world, moody graphics, and a sexy ambient soundtrack that strikes the ""comfy"" cyberpunk nerve like none other. You might not immediately warm up to it, but you'll quickly learn to love what has been created here. Deus Ex is a meaty as hell game, and one of the indisputed kings of Player Agency.Also, manually save your progress often. Trust me.Have fun!			"

												While some details of the game haven't aged well, Deus Ex is one of the penultimates of gaming to this date. An experience of fluid gameplay, ability of flexible playstyles, non-lethal runs, excellent writing, and terrible accents, it is something that everyone should always have had played. Probably multiple times.I got this game on disc in 2000 so I don't have many hours on the stame version!			"

												Dislike this game and someone will burn your house down. Either that or you will catch Grey Death and die horribly like so many others in this dystopian cyberpunk world. Or maybe some punk from Hong Kong with an accent so horribly bad it's kind of amusing will rob you and give your stuff to the Triads. I'm sure there's plenty of other things aside from this that could happen as well.Or you can like the game. The choice is yours.More seriously, this game's age is immediately obvious once you start playing it. And yet it is still a great game with flaws that, at this point, are more charming or amusing than irritating. Gameplay and story are among the best ever done for any game ever. The weaknesses lie in the dated graphics and some terrible voice acting (particularly in Hong Kong), though it's still better than Oblivion's and has more than a few unintentionally funny moments, especially from your player character JC Denton (""What a shame""). That's really it. It's pretty easy to look past the flaws however and to see a game that is superb in (almost) every area. There is real quality here, and passing this one up (particularly when it's super-cheap in a sale) is a missed opportunity. Play it.Play it or else you might be sent back to the people... in a body bag.			"

												this game can be a little hard to get into if you're not used to older pc games, it took me multiple attempts to finally be able to enjoy it but god i'm so glad i did. this game is beyond great. the amount of work put into letting the player do whatever they want to complete objectives is at times astounding, and there will be plenty of moments where you're taken aback at just how in depth it gets. this game also isn't afraid to delve into and discuss openly the themes and ideas its world evokes, and they make for some incredibly philosophical discussions between players.a lot of games in the past five years have claimed that ~every decision matters~ but this game, a 15 year old game, is the only game where i feel like i can say with complete certainty and honesty, that every decision matters			"

Do I recommend Deus Ex?Well, that's easy... if you understand the impact of ""age"" on games, then YES, you will enjoy this title.Otherwise if you think a game like TES:Oblivion is 'old', or you don't know how to change button assignments.. then no, you probably won't.It's a classic game that everyone should experience, and although it has aged a bit, I think it holds up enough in the visual department that it should be enough for people to adjust. It's no worse than Half-Life for example. Controls are completely customizable so you can set up the keys to match any FPS configuration you prefer. With a little google help it's only a matter of downloading the correct OpenGL or D3D9 dll's for modern hardware to have a smooth experience.(I am not affiliated with this website, but I have used it myself... obviously use at your own discretion: http://www.cwdohnal.com/utglr/ )My bias towards Deus ExI have recently finished Deus Ex: HR. Just last night actually. While it is a 'respectable' game in its own right, I will use it as a ""modern day"" example to compare with Deus Ex to show why I think the first game is far superior even today.I have played Deus Ex back in 2001 on an old 233mhz computer, in windowed mode using software rendering, barely pushing 5-10 fps with loading times that would equal 8-10 minutes between levels. That's right... I sat through that for the entirety of the game. Then I replayed it again about 8 years ago, and more recently the other month. (I own a GoG copy also so my Steam hours are low.)What does Deus Ex from 2000 have in comparison to todays 'like' titles Limb damage similar to _Fallout_. Does not exist in DE:HR Skill levelling similar to _Fallout Tactics_. Does not exist in DE:HR Clever secrets. (Actual, clever secrets, not just obscured vents.) Better variety of tools. More use for augmentations. Separated hacking and lock picking tools. No annoying 'mini-games' to lock pick or multi-tool. More 'realistic' alert system. If you are found by 1 enemy, the entire map doesn't suddenly know you're a threat.There are definitely quality of life issues with Deus Ex. For example, unmodded: you have to loot a body before you can carry it and hide it. no grapple melee like DE:HR or MGS, etc (this is debatable I suppose) some of the outdoor maps do have vast empty spaces, such as the opening level. strongly encourages you to play stealthily. Although this is the best way to 'experience' the game, it does mean that if you try to use the Baton (trained) on the face of an enemy that's shooting at you, after 3-4 hits you'll be dead and they'll still be standing. If you however sneak up behind them, 1 hit KO is the way to go.ConclusionDeus Ex has deep gameplay even beyond the surface. While it's not perfect, and its age is starting to slowly show, I would not disregard it especially in comparison to its supposed successors. In comparison to DE:HR, there are more options, more consequences, less annoyances, better challenges and rewards. Puzzles are actually puzzles and not just obscured vents. Passwords are hidden in clever ways, like birthdates and book names found around the world. Sometimes they can be a little too obscure, sure, but the added feeling of accomplishment is undeniable when you do eventually stumble across them.Thanks to a separated skills and augmentations system, your character will feel powerful when you do choose an Augment between A or B for each slot. Unlike DE:HR in comparison, your character doesn't feel ""weak"" for missing augments, but instead feels stronger for having attained them and in turn will never be able to just ""buy everything"".Weapons are significantly better too... you have to improve your _skills_ in particular areas, such as weapons, so that for example it will reduce the spread of your gun to improve accuracy throughout the game. What this means is that you have to consider your distance to your target before firing as you might miss! Compared to DE:HR, you won't suddenly be a 10mm sniper across the map because you found a laser pointer. Plus, the enemies aren't always 'conveniently placed' in pairs or less, so there will be times when you will actively choose to avoid combat instead of clearing a level just because you can.People who would enjoy this are people who can distinguish the difference between playing an old game with old design choices compared to those who cannot (i.e. quality of life issues mentioned above).People who would _NOT_ enjoy this game are people who will complain that the default control scheme is clunky without realising they can change the button assignments to match any contemporary FPS.It's not perfect... but it encompasses more than any individual game does today. When you play this game and experience all the nuances it has to offer... consider for a minute how incredible it would be with a contemporary engine and some minor improvements. Then you will understand how this game was so amazing in its time, and despite its age, still offers gameplay that most games don't today.			"

												If you need a game that was totally ahead of its time - here is one. Deus Ex is one of the very first, fully realized sandboxes, learning heavily from previous titles like Thief or System Shock, the game offers player near unmatched freedom in approaching the objectives, while the game's basic rules, smart level design and multitude of items only support that idea. Yes, it looks ugly - no doubt about that - and it does have some truly awful shooting mechanics, but once you get into it - you'll love it.			"

												Members of the Trilateral Commission have gone on to become Presidential candidates and there is a conspiracy among these well connected elites to use the powers of the UN to bring about a global world order that begins with a continuation of a historical process that has been occuring since the 1920's whereby the wealth gap increases until we begin sanctioning off the lower classes and killing them off in a modern form of Eugenics where only the wealthy and elite survive.JC Denton: ""Do you have a single fact to back that up?""It was at that moment that I loved JC. This is what I like about JC: he's realistic. I'm tired of dimwitted protagonists that act shocked at twists we all saw coming, or act like teenage anime protagonists that believe in the power of friendship. JC is real. Albeit a little...odd. I think they were aiming for ""Robo-cop"" with him, which would explain his frank, albeit odd, manner of speaking. Such as when someone asks if their new partner is going to be the type to wear gaudy glasses, to which he reponds, ""my vision is augmented"". It's pretty humorous how matter-of-fact he is, but entertaining as well. I like it.In case you haven't figured it out, Deus Ex is a video game taking place in an alternate future where all the conspiracy theories Alex Jones espouses are actually true. You're Jesus Christ Denton, an augmented agent of UNATCO, a UN style organization that attempts to maintain the peace of the world, a world gripped by a dystopian future whereby a ""Gray Death"" illness is causing turmoil among the lower classes as the pandemic kills off people and the rations of cures seem to only go to the upper class. The game has you going out on missions in large maps with primary objectives and secondary objectives you get right away or by talking to locals. The maps are large because the levels are meant to be tackled in various ways, such as through grates or hacking. You're meant to explore levels and find a way to accomplish your goal, which is why this game has meme status as a title meant to be replayed over and over for years on end. It's sort of amazing that even to this day this level of openness in accomplishing objectives still feels fairly new. And it's not as if Deus Ex is some MONOLITH title where you can do 900 different things to complete an objective, but the fact that more games haven't caught on is sort of surprising. It's not as if the game has a divergent plot: the plot still moves down a linear path, so you can't say that linear storytelling is impossible if you have options in gameplay.I will say that the game's shooting mechanics leave a lot to be desired. The game's combat handles oddly; it's not bad or anything, it's just not the best shooter. I talked to someone about this and they told me its becase Deus Ex isn't a shooter...and with all the options in how to tackle objectives...I can sort of see their point. Or rather, it doesn't HAVE to be primarily a shooter, which is to its benefit as its a below average shooter. The game is like this partially because there are upgrades to weapons for accuracy and reload times, and you can upgrade proficiency in these weapons through your skill tree. My only issue with it is that it doesn't feel like you're ADDING to your proficiency but rather placing BACK what the developers took AWAY. There's a definition between addition to the original and placing back what was originally there; it's like actual DLC and merely unlocking what's on the disc. The game becomes a better shooter when you upgrade, but you'll have to really go far into the game for taht to happen.Also, unlike MGS where gunfire and shots alert the facility and everyone takes note, in this game an enemy firing his gun at you and getting killed won't necessarily alert his allies in the facility. It's not really a large issue, but it leads to a sense that the enemy alertness and ai isn't fantastic as you get away with making more noise than you really should be able to. You can have a loud firefight with a shotgun and after taking out two people, go back to stealthing as if nothing happened, so long as you take out the people in the immediate vicinity. It becomes apparent that this isn't MGS levels of tightness in stealthing. Despite that, move over Half Life why wasn't this game of the decade for 2000-2010. It has everything a complex game needs to remain relevant years later. Typically, a game that tries big things is outdated later on down the line, and simpler games tend to last longer due to how simple they are (Doom). But Deus Ex still has an engaging plotline, variety and versatility in tackling objectives, maps that are still commendable in their size and areas to explore, complexity in its mechanics and RPG elements, and most of all it still has a feeling of being unique in the totality of its package. Usually the crowd overhypes things, but nope. The crowd is right: Deus Ex is an awesome game that is still good to this day. *HIGHLY* recommended.PS. God damn is this game long without feeling like it's just padding♥♥♥♥♥♥out. Why can't more games be lengthy AND packed with content. Usually titles drag out but not this one: there's purpose to the length.			"

												Deus Ex is another staple game, in my opinion. It's old, and it shows. The voice acting is so cringe worthy it's hard to actually listen to the dialogue between laughter. The graphics have aged as well as 3 year old oranges, and probably smell about the same. The combat? Fun. The writing? Enjoyable. The cybernetic systems? Cool! People who were fans of the Metal Gear franchise would enjoy this game, although I wouldn't go so far as to say that people who aren't familiar with the genre would.I do have to say, the writing is very dark, so when you encounter bits and pieces where it makes fun of itself - like the spam email requesting you commit suicide - it's very enjoyable.

												This is one of the best games I've ever played, but don't expect it to be immediately great. The first level is kind of confusing, you need to rebind the controls, you need to install 'Deus Exe' to get the game running well, etc etc etc...If you can get past all that, this is a global adventure full of prophetic things like class conflict, terrorism, loss of privacy, transhumanism, globalism, rich """"""philanthropists"""""" manipulating society [cough cough soros cough cough], and more. I would recommend if you're a fan of stealth games or a political thinker, and don't mind dealing with an older piece of software.Play on Realistic for the best experience: you die a lot faster, but so do your enemies. Forces you to come up with strategies on the fly and experiment to get yourself out of a situation. The game's quality slumps only a few times: the mission where you board a superfreighter is nowhere near as exciting as it should be, and the MJ12 undersea base is similarly boring.As a music freak I am obligated to tell you that this game has some of the best songs you will ever hear in a game. There's so much good♥♥♥♥♥♥here that every player has a different answer as to what their favorite is.			"

												It's a level design clinic.  The only other game that's in the frame is Hitman: Blood Money, but these levels are stronger because there are just so, so many ways to get it done.  By the time you complete a level, you've almost assuredly missed half of it.Add to that meaningful character build choices and a wealth of freedom of choice, and you've got yourself a masterpiece.  Want to sneak around and bop everyone over the head with a baton?  Sure.  Prefer to go in guns blazing and use the GEP gun to solve the big problems?  That works too.  Snipe them from a mile out, brain them with a silenced pistol from behind...you've got options.  About all that's missing is Force Lightning.Then there's the sheer volume of content, which is almost too much.  New York is about the length of a conventional game these days.  Then there's Hong Kong and the endgame.  It doesn't get much better than this, if it does at all.			"

THIS GAME SCORES [0 1 2 | 3 4 *5*] = ~92% (83%-100%)I've played this to death, so when I ask myself ""Play Deus Ex?"" the answer is now ""Nah."", and this would negatively color my judgment. But if I really ask myself, I'd have to say that this is by far my favorite game of all time. I must have done more than 20 complete play-throughs, and that's a conservative estimate.This is (so far) the best execution of what happens to be my favorite kind of game: The lone wolf 1st person 3D experience. An immersive setting with story background and world simulation where I can (within tight limits) do whatever I want. Bonus points if I am somewhat a special/superior character, however borderline pathetic that may sound.So much for the review of this game.OTHER GAMES LIKE THISGames that satisfy some of the above criteria:Deus ExDeus Ex: Invisible WarDeus Ex: Human RevolutionDeus Ex: The Fall (which is relatively crappy, and most of all it has damn low FOV, but that can be fixed now according to PCGW[pcgamingwiki.com])Deus Ex: Mankind DividedThief: The Dark ProjectThief II: The Metal Age (2000)Thief: Deadly Shadows (2004)NOT Thief 2014, I don't like this one.Neon Struct (which was very obviously made to deliver on at least the bare minimum of said criteria - recommended, but you should set your expectations low for a good experience)And quite a few more. BUT NOT ENOUGH! Seriously, this kind of gameplay - if it's well done, you will get my money. I'm thirsty enough to even dwell on crappy such products like Far Cry 3/4 which are very obviously a theme park and very obviously uninspired.A MISSING GENREWhile I'm making wishes - what I very much desire to come into existence: A mix of Deus Ex like gameplay and Minecraft. No wait you don't know what I mean: Did you ever create a monster grinder in Minecraft? What's great about that is that the world's elements and simulation are intuitively used to create a considerably different additional element in the world. All of a sudden, you have a ginormous machine in which you constantly hear monsters die, and you get their drops in a central outlet. So, what do I mean when I say ""mix of Deus Ex gameplay and Minecraft""?The best way to demonstrate this is to point out a key difference between Deus Ex: Human Revolution and its predecessors. In DX:HR, the automatic turrets can not just be hacked (which is cool but possible in all DX games), but you can carry them around which allows to create new strategic situations. This is emergent gameplay! I must say that DX:HR's use of this aspect is a bit underdeveloped, but anyway: That's an example of you using elements in the world intuitively to alter the game's situations.So, what if you could build traps (camera wired with explosives; if certain characters are seen, the explosives go off)? Or you could take a terminal and reprogram/reconfigure it somehow. A fully destructible environment would be cool, too: Realize that so far, when this has been done, the destruction was just far too easy. In reality, if you'd explode a LAM on a wall of the 'ton hotel, it would wear down the wall, possibly even knock out a small part of it, but overall you'd do little damage. And shooting a whole magazine into a wall would not make a hole in it.So, what if a realistic form of destructibility and ability to construct (Requiring the right tools and considering weight limits, so no way you can carry around a wall.) were part of the game? What if the machinery you deal with in the end of Deus Ex (1) is somewhat really functioning with its water pumps and such, instead of the buttons just being facade that drive the story? What if in Doom 3, if a firefight damages the pipes and cables around you too much, a side-mission emerges completely naturally/logically: Before you can progress, you have to repair stuff.Do you have any idea how incredibly high the replayability of THOSE games would be? Deus Ex with its fixed world is already high in this regard, but with a more modular world, we'd do real damage to the game market economy :)An additional bonus would be this: 3D game worlds are only facades. Maybe you don't notice, but when you explore a new game world, you actively try to find out which types of doors (or whatever element) are real and which types are only decoration. This factor alone considerably lowers immersion, because even if visually nothing negatively changes to you, you're still looking at the world through these filter glasses instead of just looking at the world. But if the game world would consist of Minecraft-like objects (Not necessarily cubes. E.g. a placed computer terminal object could have its corresponding shape.), you'd know that everything is real, every ""door block"" (or whatever) would fundamentally be like any other door block. And you'd know that the wall is not paper thin with a hall-of-mirrors void behind it, but there is always substance.Minecraft survival is great (Let's ignore creative mode here, and let's also mostly ignore the ability to build.), and 1st person story shooter games are great, what's still COMPLETELY MISSING (Seriously, WTF? Do you realize how crass this is?) is games that mix the two properly. We have plenty of multiplayer destructive environment shooters, but we don't have such a thing as a single player experience in a realistic environment with story and not too much fighting. That's a completely unwritten book. An entire genre waiting to be created, ground waiting to be broken, gaming history waiting to be written.			"

												One heck of a learning curve, but once you understand what this is, you'll love it. It's not an rpg, a shooter, or a stealth game in the usual sense, but an odd mixture of the three that really can only be described as deus ex. It's difficult for me to pinpoint what makes it so great, but from what ive gathered it has to do with the level design, and your choices of skills to upgrade. For example: on one playthrough I built a ""James Bond,"" type character who would sneak through levels with his silent pistol and use grenades and stealth drones to eliminate larger targets, then on the another I made a hackerman type character who had very little in the means of combat, but could sneak past enemies to hack the security systems to turn off cameras and open doors. On the next I built the deus ex equivalent of the terminator. Able to move so quickly and take so much damage that no army could withstand my reign of terror. Once you understand the game, you can play it in just about any way you want... Except for master level swimming and poison resistance. Don't even try it.Protips:*The sides of the redicule do not indicate the exact margins of where your bullets may go. You are more accurate than you think.*Robots are mean, avoid them.*There is always a way to sneak into a compound, even if it appears to be a forced combat situation.*running away is always an option*The gep gun is the best option for a silent takedown.

												A game with a great story that has a lot of crazy plot twists and many different maps ranging from New York to Hong Kong and Paris, all made extremely well to cater to both stealthy and guns-blazing gameplay. A traditional RPG in the sense that you are able to make J.C Denton exactly how you want him to be, with many different things that you can upgrade, ranging from combat abilities like improving his aim with rifles or pistols, and non-combat abilities like lockpicking and hacking. You can acquire the points needed through completing the current map, many different side quests that can be found in that area and also finding secret locations. The combat in the game can be seen as dated by lots of people and they are not wrong, but when you take into account that it has to be how it is due to it being an RPG, you will learn to forgive it. How the combat abilities work is that you will need to aim your crosshair on the enemy and it will slowly become smaller, which gradually improves the accuracy of your shot. So, if you do not train in the pistol skill, it's going to be very inaccurate and slow to become accurate and will lead to boring tedious gameplay, so I personally recommend upgrading your pistol skill to Trained right at the beginning of the game.There is lots of great albeit corny dialogue throughout the game with all the amazing characters in it. The only negatives for this game is that it is relatively uneasy to get into due to the first map being extremely large and it's quite easy to get lost. Also, some of the dialogue in the game are very low quality, not in the sense that the writing is bad because it's a game from the year 2000, but some of the mics that the voice actors used were very poor quality. Some areas like Hong Kong and Paris have characters with hard to understand accents, and this is most likely on purpose as English would not be their primary language, and personally I loved this.If running on a modern system, I recommend getting some things that allow for higher resolutions and increased FOV, there is a great guide on Steam which helped me a lot in quickly setting it up. In my opinion, don't use the HD character models.

A uniquely compelling game with an intricate storyline, vast amounts of dialogue and interesting technical presentation.This review originally from May 2009.Deus Ex is foremost a unique game in its field. It is really quite unlike any other game I have ever played. It shares territory with titles such as Half-Life and Tomb Raider, but also takes inspiration from some role-playing games as well. It seems to have carved out or invented its personal little niche in the game market, by mixing two normally contrasting game essentials. It manages to successfully combine puzzle, shooting and RPG elements to create a really exceptional atmosphere. While it may have several middling faults which will occasionally make you cringe, it is mostly an extremely fun and thought-provoking game, inspired by both modern conspiracy theories and philosophy.The storyline is based in the near future, and revolves around nano-augmented (basically this just means technologically enhanced) Agent J. C. Denton, who works for the United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO), based out of Liberty Island, New York. As is normal, the world of the future is not a safe place to be, and UNATCO must protect the citizens of the Earth from various terrorist plots and evil denizens. Primarily in the first mission of the game, you must regain control of the Statue of Liberty and Liberty Island, which has been seized by an organisation known as the NSF (National Secessionist Forces). The plot is far to complex to go into detail, and it would also spoil the game, but save to say that the basic premise is that Denton must work to solve problems relating to deadly viruses (which has the lovely sounding name Grey Death), corrupt governments and world domination attempts. The plot is really the best aspect of Deus Ex, as without it, it would not have anywhere near the same novelty value. The game is also extremely long, taking often upwards of twenty hours to complete, and if you were to go hunting for all the many hidden locations, objects and side-quests it will take much longer. Luckily, there are only a few dull moments during this, as you will be visiting New York, Hong Kong and Paris on the globe-hopping crusade. It can however become slightly annoying when you must retrace your steps several times in order to return to previous locations in each city. During this epic journey Denton talks to literally dozens and dozens of other characters, all of whom have a great array of responses, and can be conversed with many times. However, this leads me to probably one of the largest faults of Deus Ex: the character voices.Although every character talks a great deal, and the scripts themselves are very good and involving, the voice acting is frankly rather below standard. Absolutely no characters (with the possible exception of arch villain Bob Page) seem to have any genuine emotions in their voices at all, and instead inhabit a world where emotions have seemingly been destroyed, or at least mainly forgotten about. Denton and his brother Paul both speak like they have walked out of the Terminator films as reincarnations of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Even when people are hurt, they shout or scream only in a vaguely half-hearted manner. Listening to all of these emotionless and mainly blunt conversations can sometimes get a bit tiresome; although you will often be too engrossed in the subjects they are discussing to notice this. On top of this, mainly the musical score is also rather dull, and mostly sounds very similar and unremarkable (though it will inevitably slowly grow on you anyway), apart from the classic main title theme. However, general sound effects and ambient sounds are quite good.Thankfully, gameplay itself is consistently solid throughout. It is theoretically possible to get through the entire game without killing anyone (save from one or two characters who must be incapacitated), as you are given a wide range of both lethal and non-lethal weapons with which to take on enemies. However this can get extremely difficult (as you will be frequently running out of non-lethal ammunition) and furthermore, you are given no incentive to do so (apart from the honour). It is much easier (and often all the more fun) to go in with all guns blazing, although this may not always be the best way to handle a given situation. Shooting and targeting is relatively easy, although it can be tricky earlier in the game when skill levels are lower. Graphically, the game isn't much to look at today, but that just gives it the much sought after ""classic"" feel.A nice touch is to give Denton the various abilities to learn skills such as lock-picking, hacking computers, swimming and making aiming easier, through the reward of skill points, which are earned by achieving certain goals or fully exploring the different maps. This can make your own version of Denton able to complete certain tasks much easier. At first, this system seems overcomplicated, and to be frank it often is leading to an RPG-ish feel, and could have probably been implemented more simply, though the scheme is easily workable. The gameplay also has several nice problem-solving virtues, and situations can be resolved through a number of ways. The game makes use of a detailed inventory menu, from which you can see objects picked up, check health and review known information and objectives. Also, you handling of situations will influence other characters views and opinions of you, subtly changing the storyline. Due to this, it is very unlikely you will ever replay exactly the same story.Deus Ex is simply different from anything else, and stands out from the crowd on its own plinth. It is a welcome change from the more stereotypical action-adventure, and blends many different elements almost seamlessly together. Although it does have some minor faults, I still highly recommend it to anyone, as everyone should be able to overlook the mediocre voice acting and still thoroughly enjoy this game, in all its ""cyberpunk"" glory. In retrospect, Deus Ex has to be looked upon as a worthy contender in any “Greatest Games” list. The true value lies in the morality, philosophy and conspiracy themes the story focuses upon, which help to stimulate both the mind and psyche.			"

												Deus Ex 10 / 10 (2001)Play as Secret Agent Denton to serve and defend your Country.... A 3D First Person Adventure. The Story is Complex; discover plans within plans and be prepared to make choices that have a drastic impact on the game and the finale(s). 100% Enjoyable. Develop your Character's Skills with Nanobot upgrades, there are multiple paths that will allow you to play Your prefered Strategy (Negotiate VS Sneak VS Speed VS FullMetaljacket). This was one of the first real Sandbox games, so many paths at every point .... so many options.I originally played this on a 17"" Mac in 2001. I locked myself in the Room after the first 30 minutes and marathoned the game in 2 days. I was hooked. Since then I have replayed DeusEx many times.... including when it came out on Steam (2007). It has lost none of the Magic. This game was My Favorite Game of All Time (2001 - 2012) because the story was so rich but did not get in the way; the player is Free to discover as much or as little of the story as necessary; One of the greatest games of all time....The Story will captivate you. The Graphics are dated but not distracting. The Audio is quite engaging, and a number of the compositions are simply outstanding (esp. in Paris and in Hong Kong). The Remix of 'Siren Synapse' (The Hong Kong Theme) by the OST Composer himself Alexander Brandon is available on OCRemix.org and is a real gem.... get it on this page under the 'download' tab near the top:http://ocremix.org/remix/OCR01914Interview with Alexander Brandonhttp://ocremix.org/info/Composer_Interview:_Alexander_BrandonAfterthoughts: This is not Quake or some other FPS....

												So this, the original Deus Ex is a game that defies logic. 16 years after inital release this game it remains the only game that truly follows through on the promise that any playstyle can complete the game. the ability to simply sneak past an enemy or snipe it from across the map, or even run around with a lazer sword swinging away at anything that moves. The gameplay remains to this day as tight and fufilling as it has always been. The only real issue that stands befor players today is the graphics, however these issues have been all but resolved through texture update mods that one can find easily through the game's very newsfeed.

												Deus Ex is a game that most of you should know already. It is a game that revolutionized the FPS genre as the original ""Thinking Man's Shooter"". It was groundbreaking in every single aspect, from the open-ended gameplay to the storytelling to the RPG elements it borrowed.Basically, Deus Ex is an FPS with some RPG elements added on to give your character a better sense of progression. You start off as just another agent but as you improve your skills and acquire new implants you become a truly unstoppable force.The maps are huge and sprawling with tons of enemies and civilians and there is never just one way of going about accomplishing your objectives. Everywhere is littered with secret tunnels, hidden stashes, locked doors, automated defenses and patrolling sentries. Although the storyline isn't quite open enough to say that every game plays differently you can safely say that each map has hundreds of different ways to complete it.The storyline will from the start seem like a classic cops vs. terrorists but as you progress through the game you will find that nothing what it seems and nobody is who they pretend to be. You will find that your actions have real tangible gameplay consequences as you decide who should die and who should live and there are many surprises waiting for you down the line.It's not a game that holds your hand and tells you who to kill and who to spare, more often than not a first time player will allow his enemies to live never realizing that there are real consequences and rewards to putting a gun to their head and ending their existence right there. Similarly there are those who can be spared or saved from death that will come back to help you or haunt you later in the game. This is all something you have to figure out for yourself as you play through the game and I wouldn't want to spoil it for you.Although the graphics have aged quite a bit since it's release the availability of high-resolution texture packs and other fan-made graphical enhancements means it's playable even in this day and age.Deus Ex is perhaps one of the greatest games ever released for PC and, in my humble opinion, the greatest shooter ever released. It's only real competition being from the System Shock games.Truly a masterpiece of gaming and hopefully one day we will see a proper sequel.			"

												The original Deus Ex has made its way into my all-time favourites since my very first time playing it about three years ago, and it is unfortunate that I did not experience this masterpiece when it came out. Just over two months ago, I finished replaying it, and those were amazing two-odd weeks ploughing through its almost perfect campaign.This is the ultimate epitome of a first-person role-playing game. Even its very few flaws do not result in any considerable frustration, and the fluidity in gameplay and mechanics outbalance the blemishes, thanks to its excellent insertion of the augmentation system and its relevance to mission progression, or its meticulously designed maps, or its well-balanced and concise skill chart. Stealth would need a little improvement in terms of AI response and timing of critical moments (e.g. the player finds situations in which, after being flat-out spotted, the only urgency is to hide behind a crate so that the sin is forgiven), and it must be said that this is the game’s most apparent problem. In sum, the challenge that the stealth element poses is greatly reduced by the enemy’s poor response and follow-up actions to spotting. Another problem is the shallow issue of graphics and general animation. Naturally, this is a minor aspect to worry about, but it could be argued that textures, as well as said animations, are not en par with games from the same period, such as the posterior Return to Castle Wolfenstein, or even the preceding System Shock 2; both more visually appealing than Deus Ex.It could be argued that story, writing and player’s choice are the pillars that hold the game up there on the eRPG Olympus. The main premise encompasses themes such as global conspiracy, scientific/pharmaceutical agendas, corporate domination of geopolitics, and the confines of biological manipulation. The approach to such themes demonstrates the maturity and profound research done by main writer Sheldon Pacotti, and the ideological directions that the game can take will depend solely on the player, without any biases ultimately affecting the general mood. Main missions are no-nonsense tasks that are as intimately related to the plotline as a story-driven gaming narrative can get, and the side missions are an additional flavour to the lore that periodically unravels with each book or data vault accessed. Everything works in perfect unison. The long and versatile campaign can be played several times and still not be exhausted from all the plot possibilities that arise should the player simply pick a different choice when dealing with a major objective. The choices shall always be there, whether the headway involves breaching into a building to reach a quest target’s whereabouts, or choosing the fate of the populace from a destitute area portrayed in a grim future. Additionally, the story carries convincing alternate chronicles for the fictional geopolitical scenario that it proposes: the protagonist J. C. Denton travels to multiple locations in different real-world countries and, either through news segments found on papers casually lying about or through dialogue, is able to make sense of the plot and the dystopian intricacies that it articulates. In fact, every piece of plot-related data is cleverly placed and communicated, and even the interpolations are executed meticulously and with later lore to back it up as the player advances through the missions. The several twists in the narrative never wane, precisely because every bit of adversity is accounted for during gameplay and is there to integrate the political dilemma posed by the storyline.Remarkably orchestrated, Deus Ex excels at virtually every aspect of gaming development, which paved the way for the title to become such a successful franchise afterwards. Incorporation of several gameplay dynamics may be its most notable quality – quite a novelty for a late-90s/early-2000s game, and a virtue that it shares with the likes of the aforementioned System Shock 2, for instance –, even though story and writing may be its greatest one *for an RPG*. In terms of audio production, besides some decent voice acting, the beautiful soundtrack conveys the game’s cyberpunk aesthetics, and the synth-based music is an aural delight composed by Unreal genius Alexander Brandon and Michiel van den Bos, among others. Deus Ex is a genuine gem of its time and onwards; a complete package for those who crave for a mature action-RPG experience and/or for those who want a taste of high-quality sci-fi in a videogame.

Soon you will have your God, and you will make it with your own hands.Often considered the greatest game of all time, I came into the original Deus Ex with high expectations. I played entirely unmodded, wanting to see what the game was like all those years ago. GameplayProbably the most important factor in the enjoyment of a game is gameplay, and Deus Ex delivers in this department. It does take some time to adjust to the somewhat clunky controls and mechanics of the game, but when it all finally clicks for you after some experimenting, you feel immensely rewarded. All it takes is to find a style of play you really enjoy, and there are many different styles. For example, the first mission provides you with an immediate choice of weapons: Rifle, Crossbow or GEP Gun. Then you are let loose to blast terrorists or sneak around, or any mix of the two. So many different choices in every level, it would take me a very long time to describe it here. StoryI don't want to spoil anything, because the story is one of the best I've experienced in gaming. But here is the basic premise: You are the newest agent in anti-terrorist organization UNATCO and are sent to stop a group of terrorists called the NSF from stealing a cure to a virus... The story unfolds from there...Graphics, Atmosphere and SoundThe graphics are quite dated but still functional. There should be no real issues here; gameplay and story is what matters. The main issue is facial animation for me, and I did get some texture clipping, but mods and other things likely fix this. The atmosphere is great, I felt as though I was actually there. I don't, again, want to spoil anything; it's best if you experience it for yourself. The soundtrack is truly excellent; a techno-beat to most of the music, and a little bit of jazz sprinkled in here and there; brilliant stuff. I listen to it outside of the game it's that excellent.

Before rambling, I would like to give a special thanks to Brother Tasty and my actual brother, TableTerrorsMatt, for proof-reading this review. Deus Ex is a stealth action game created by Ion Storm in the year 2000. Now this legendary entry in the gaming industry is considered one of the most innovative of all time to many, included in its theme of stealth, roleplaying, choice, action, exploration, and many other labels, as its popularity has transcended since its creation. In Deus Ex, you play as protagonist JC Denton, an operative for UNATCO who’s primary focus is to thwart a terrorist organization, NSF’s, tactics, such as the theft of a chemical weapon known as Ambrosia. The player given primary and optional objectives during the briefing for each mission, and then are allowed free reign to complete said objectives in, pretty much, any way they wish.Here are a few items that I found of interest in Deus Ex:Roleplaying - As protagonist JC Denton, players traverse various stages with given objectives while gaining experience points to enhance aspects of their character’s statistics. The upgrade system is impeccable, and allows the player to proceed in situations in nearly any way possible, which allows for multiple forms of play and progression. Another element of great importance is how choices-both in and out of dialogues-affect an abundance of things within the game. For example, your starting equipment choices and statistics will influence how you manipulate the world and its peoples, allowing you to uncover a multitude of secrets. Simple actions such as going to the ladies’ restroom to check for loot may prompt simple dialogue changes, hence why Director Joseph Manderly, the protagonist’s boss, scorned me for doing so. A touch of realism is portrayed in Deus Ex as well since getting paid actually feels like getting paid. For example, Director Manderly will explain your monetary and experience gains after each mission within a conversational flow, which accentuates a seamless transition between operations and downtime.Stealth System - It is difficult to entirely describe the sensation that is this title’s stealth gameplay presents. Character augments, statistical upgrades, and player skill all contribute to the experience, yet this game seemingly knows how to also look past these and simply demonstrate a stealth ‘feel’ in comparison to relying on only the said features. Like nearly every other game created in the genre, the player can maneuver while hidden through territories by utilizing the crouch command-activated with the Control key-and by passing silently in the shadows, preferring muffled or melee eliminations over brutal assault. Several useable items such as the stun rod and tranquilizer rounds for the crossbow emphasize the purpose of stealth, but are not so overpowered that it makes the approach simple; player timing and cunning are key to success while dodging enemy forces in Deus Ex.Player and Non-Player Dialogue - As described previously, many of the actions that JC Denton can perform may be mentioned by non-player characters throughout the game; some of these exchanges can occur randomly-such as in the incident mentioned within the spoiler text-, but mostly appear within conversation with others. There is also a great dialogue selection when speaking with civilians or UNATCO personnel ranging from calm and inquisitive to brash threatening.Level Design - Though similar themes may be present through individual missions, each level retains its own unique feel and layout that abstains from any two levels being blindly alike. Deus Ex utilizes a multiple-layer design in many of its missions, with street-, basement-, and roof-accessible venues that contribute to the open-ended gameplay; this may not seem like a huge feature, but with so many stealth action games forcing players to endure ‘straight’ level mechanics while claiming its style to be open-world, this ideal is magnificent. Strewn throughout each level are also intricately-placed traps and alarms that Gary Gygax himself would be proud of.TL:DR - Deus Ex is undoubtedly a legend in the gaming world, and continues to shine in its current age. This title near-flawlessly executes a stealth gameplay experience that all fanatics of the genre must play. There is so much more I would like to say about Deus Ex but nothing anyone could say can truly bring justice to how innovative this game was and still is. I highly recommend this title to individuals who enjoy stealth action, roleplaying, and cyberpunk themes. Thanks for reading.Do you enjoy these reviews?

Soon you will have your God, and you will make it with your own hands.Often considered the greatest game of all time, I came into the original Deus Ex with high expectations. I played entirely unmodded, wanting to see what the game was like all those years ago. GameplayProbably the most important factor in the enjoyment of a game is gameplay, and Deus Ex delivers in this department. It does take some time to adjust to the somewhat clunky controls and mechanics of the game, but when it all finally clicks for you after some experimenting, you feel immensely rewarded. All it takes is to find a style of play you really enjoy, and there are many different styles. For example, the first mission provides you with an immediate choice of weapons: Rifle, Crossbow or GEP Gun. Then you are let loose to blast terrorists or sneak around, or any mix of the two. So many different choices in every level, it would take me a very long time to describe it here. StoryI don't want to spoil anything, because the story is one of the best I've experienced in gaming. But here is the basic premise: You are the newest agent in anti-terrorist organization UNATCO and are sent to stop a group of terrorists called the NSF from stealing a cure to a virus... The story unfolds from there...Graphics, Atmosphere and SoundThe graphics are quite dated but still functional. There should be no real issues here; gameplay and story is what matters. The main issue is facial animation for me, and I did get some texture clipping, but mods and other things likely fix this. The atmosphere is great, I felt as though I was actually there. I don't, again, want to spoil anything; it's best if you experience it for yourself. The soundtrack is truly excellent; a techno-beat to most of the music, and a little bit of jazz sprinkled in here and there; brilliant stuff. I listen to it outside of the game it's that excellent. ConclusionIf you have never played Deus Ex, then what are you waiting for? At least say you gave it a fair go, and you will have been able to experience what was once the height of gaming, and now is relegated to perhaps a lesser position, but is still truly excellent. jmcone's personal rating: Highly Recommended "

												A true legend, Deus Ex is the ultimate game, the game every other game wants to be. It is complete with a story worthy of a trilogy of books and their respective movies and an amazing, breathtaking, dynamic gameplay.What's your style? You could hide in the shadows, lockpick that door, walk around slowly, and silently take down that guard with your electric prod, or, you could blast through that iron door with a LAM and annihilate all enemies with your plasma rifle, or perhaps you could hack into their security system and turn it against them, the possibilities are infinite, but beware, your actions, decisions, and even the way you play the game WILL have consequences.""Never know when I might come up against heavy armor. Give me the GEP gun.""Update: Updated review to get an achievement :B1:			"

												Deus ex fanboys will try to decapitate me for saying that i liked the game but didn't love it. I know for a fact that i would have loved it if i played it when it came out but i only played it for the first time a few years ago so the game is a little dated to me. This game can be brutal to newcomers or modern gamers that don't play these classic pc games. You are not specialised at any skills at the start of the game so those first few hours can be very difficult and you can easily f*ck up what you chose to upgrade and you cant reverse it.Stages like Hong kong, raiding the warehouse in new york and the ocean lab is why i really like this game (and the laser sword) however i do feel the gameplay is a bit dated and some of the stages i found really boring like paris. I still think its a great game and you should try it at least once. 8/10 (Great)			"

 One of the best games of all time. Deus Ex is one of the first games I've played. And this is one of my favorite games. It has everything - a magnificent atmosphere of cyberpunk, the interesting part of the story and memorable characters, varied gameplay and an excellent level design. By 2014, the game is outdated only graphically, to play it is still interesting, and part of the story is far superior to all the current trends.			"

												How many years had passed since I first played this game? Nine? Well even after all this time, it's hard for me to find game which would give player great story with many ways of aproaching it. One of the things that didn't age well here are the graphics. Of course, you can repair it with some mods (if you're at moding try ""Malkavian"" mod), but animation may still bug you out. Is it worth it? Hell yes. You can put hours upon hours, and still find something like hidden stach, weapon, dialogues or even locations. My advice is to wait a bit, so you can save some penies on bigger discount.			"

Choice and Consequence.Even in recent times, no other game comes close to the feeling of choice and consequence that Deus Ex offers.Along with atmosphere and quality of writing, it's one of the game's most obvious strengths. They are both factors that persist throughout the entire game allowing players to forge their own J.C Denton. At a time when players had not seen this marriage of complex storytelling but in a 3d world, Deus Ex managers to offer up an incredibly rich and adult story while pulling it off effortlessly. Huge props to the writers(s)Unfortunately time has not been kind to the gameplay and presentation of Deus Ex. The game was not a stunner on release, and the gameplay will definitely seem antiquated to most people. But it's not bad by any means, it just lacks a lot of niceties that modern games offer.Do yourself the favour. It's consistently named the best PC game of all time for a reason... "

												Extremely entertaining stealth and sniping gameplay that is negligibly marred by the suspension-of-disbelief-shattering stupidity of the guards. The shooting is atrocious and the guns are boring, but interestingly enough, on high difficulty (where open gunfighting is non-viable regardless) this isn't even apparent. The story is so conspiracy-theory laden as to be comical, but merits a mention as an interesting cyberpunk tale.			"

												The ambience, the environment itself, the sensations I felt when I picked it up for the first time were...inefable. Okay this game is so great because some guys from Looking Glass (the dev team behind SS2, that is System Shock 2) decided to make another great game.It is pretty similar to SS2 in a variety of ways:-inventory-Role-Playing-Game features are almost alike-weapons are almost alike tooThere is something more:-talking with other people will help you get through a lot of troubles-there is some simple Stealth mechanic which makes the game more interesting-non-linearity makes replaybility feasible-deep reasonings around philosophical concepts (not too much I assure you and they are not unnecessarily mind-bogglingly complicated as Hegel)This game talks about how humans modified their bodies to become more powerful through cyber implants. This shifted human potential limitessly. You are the newest model: a genetic enhanced human being. Someone is hiding something, but for the moment you are safe. Watch your back Agent, for lots of issues lie up ahead.There is the DeusEx Editor if you wish to spend some time building your own levels.In short:I recommend this game because it is a must have in the FPS-RPG hybrid genres. I consider this game as the indirect offspring of SS2 and because it is a lot more deep than most games nowadays, I want you to consider this tiny review with a great deal of care.Thanks for reading.

												Let me start off by saying that I am not writing this as if I'm halfway into the game or I've only completed the first mission and collectively soiled myself in pure excitement and leftover tacos. No, I have just finished the game not more than 10 minutes ago, and managed to grab all 3 endings in the process. I will tell you right now, although games like Oblivion and Portal cloud my top 5 favorite games with the ham fisted strength of nostalgia, this game is one of the greatest games I have ever experienced. The stealth is near-superb, with the only hiccups being that bodies will go undetected and JC will be chewed out for killing, even though everyone was rendered unconscious. I played through the game utilizing only the stealth crossbow, taser, and police baton in a fruitful effort of not killing anyone, but the beauty is that you can play through however you want. Depending on how you allocate your skills, you can speed through maps toting a nuclear death launcher or a small machine gun, paving the way with bullets. You can be cautious and invest in disabling security, then sneakily headshotting enemy troopers. Or you can be like me, and be the ghost that is never seen. All of the above only focuses on the gameplay aspect. The story? Fantastic. It has the right amount of plot deviations and well versed story telling that surrounds itself in conspiracy. The graphics? They are subpar, but for the year 2000, not too bad. The soundtrack? While it is very 2000-centric in nature, it still holds up very well and fits the mood of the area. It will leave your ears wanting more and more.So, do I recommend this game? Yes. Yes, very much so. No matter what your playstyle is, the game will fit it like a glove. Don't hesitate to purchase.

												I remembered having invested a huge amount of time playing this game last year immediately after buying it from winter sale and here's what I can say about this game based on what I can remember,  What I liked about Deus Ex  ;-  Gameplay variety  such as hacking an ATM or computer using ICEBREAKER, using multi-tool to unlock the door, being stealthy allows you to be a pacifist like rendering your enemies unconscious with stun gun or baton (with correct aug upgrades and skills), insta-kill your enemies with headshots with Stealth Pistol upgraded with scope and better damage or simply sneak past as many enemies as possible-  A well written story of a cyber-punk sci-fi thriller  about an augmented man working for an anti-terrorist faction against NSF who finds himself in a complicated, black and gray morality situation with corrupted people and others with best intention willing to do some shady work such as  a noble terrorist leader willingly gives away weapons to some punks who used them to mug a hobo -  Augmentations and skills In my first playthrough (pacifist-run), JC is trained in using Low-Tech weaponry and heavily augmented with Combat Strength so that I could knock out enemies with a baton on their heads while remaining stealthy. Later on, I made JC ♥♥♥♥ing bulletproofed with dermal armor and can regenerate his health at faster rate while knocking out most enemies with single hit using a ♥♥♥♥ing baton because JC is master in Low-Tech weapons.-  This game acknowledge your actions  For example,a) I remembered one time when my superior scolded me for entering a female toilet room.b)  During my escape from UNATCO, at a train station, I stumbled upon Anna Navarre who blocked the entrance to the exit. As usual, I decided to run away to the exit and surrendered to Gunther after finding myself completely outgunned and outmanned by UNATCO forces. But I got curious about what would happen if I choose to fight Anna so I reload a previous save and tried to fight Anna with my missle launcher. To my surprise, I killed Anna with maybe 5 or 6 rockets...and Gunther swore a revenge on me later on. Usually, pacifist players would kill her with a kill-switch in which I did in my first playthrough c)  Before I defect to NSF, I managed to turn the satellites to certain directions and eventually a villain found out about this and sent a group of UNATCO soldiers to take me out. Of course, I reload a save and knocked every UNATCO soldiers out in a building and once again to my surprise, the villain told me that I ""won this round"" and I'm going to die within 24 hours because they made a kill-switch specifically for me -  Attention-to-detail Admittedly I only read some newspapers, books or whatever to understand the lore and background of this game. But I do noticed for the fact that the writers put amount of effort to put any existed theories into the game such as Area 51, Illuminati and so on. Perhaps, I should read as many as I can in my next playthrough?-  Replayability This game is designed to be played in many ways as possible. Thus, giving me an excuse to play the game for a second round with a different build for JC in the future.-  Soundtracks -  Runs really well in modern laptop, for the most part  On the otherhand, there are numerous flaws in this game such as  ;-  This game is too ♥♥♥♥ing dark I remembered at one of certain points in the game where I had to navigate myself at the top of apartment buildings filled with NSF soldiers equipped with snipers. Even if I did make my game more brighter, I can't see a thing in distance and it makes me nauseas.-  Some cheesy voice acting especially from Asian characters... -  The graphic for its time seems a bit out-dated even compared to other games released at 2000/2001 that I've played -  The dialogue choices in the game seems limited -  Some skills are pretty useless and not worth investing skill point on them specially swimming and hacking Though hacking is not entirely useless, its just that you have to click the ICEBREAKER and wait until it allows you're in and from there on, you can deactivate the cameras, turrets and bots quickly before the timer runs out.Overall, I give this game 8.5/10. Deus Ex is far from perfect but its a well-made game that gives you many solutions to solve problems without resorting to killing enemies.  Hell, you can even finish the boss fights using words if you try to look for this solution with effort  "

												This is one of the best games ever made, I never got to play it when it was first released, so i bought it in the Square Enix titles sale, because i heard alot of good things about Deus Ex. Was Deus Ex  that  good?  YES   Yes, Yes, Yes. It was even better than I expected *Spoilers Ahead*Deus Ex drives you into a futuristic dystopian world, where you find out that the government is corrupt, that UNATCO (The organization that you worked for) is corrupt too and that they are working with different organizations that hide the vaccine to the plague from the civilians, one of those groups, Majestic 12, is doing experiments with humans and animals, and other terrifying experiments.In Deus Ex you change sides from the UNATCO to the NSF, Illuminati, Triads and the Silhouette. Turns out your brother, Paul Denton, worked for those organizations, and you have to the option to follow him or not, and later in the game you will have to make a critical decision if Paul lives, or dies. The more you advance and play the game, the deeper you go into the conspiracy.The Atmosphere in Deus Ex is just simply amazing, despite the old graphics (which i dont really care about, i dont play games for their graphics) it feels like you are really trying to find out the truth in a dystopian world, and the awesome  music is done by a musical genious, Alexander Brandon, who also made soundtracks for Jazz Jackrabbit 2, Unreal Tournament, Unreal, and many more games. By the way, this game predicted 9/11... when you start the game... you should notice.Deus Ex: Game of the year Edition is a masterpiece. Everyone should play it.			"

												Prior to Deus Ex: Human Revolution and the success of that title, came Deus Ex, the game that started it all. Playable in 16 and 32 bit, this game shows it's age even on the higher graphical settings. More simplistic than later incarnations of the series, Deus Ex, still packs a punch as a fun and exciting game, taking you through the Deus Ex Universe. If you loved Human Revolution, you must play the Original Deus Ex, just to absorb the back story. If you are new to the series, I recommend the original Deus Ex, prior to playing the newer, later games in the series, to get the full back story. All in all, it is still a great game and there are aspects of the game that look visually amazing, such as some reflective surfaces. Still a Thumbs up.			"

Deus Ex is quite simply a class apart.By the time I acquired a PC of my own, Deus Ex had already succeeded Half Life as the cutting edge game of choice and as such it was one the first titles I owned on the format.With so many well realized characters, set pieces and working objects ranging from hacking tools to working vending machines, Deus Ex followed Duke Nukem 3D‘s example by offering one of the most interactive game worlds ever seen.Although playing around with the basket ball on the junkie-owned court in the first open level was fairly pointless in of itself, it’s the little touches like these that gave Deus Ex a reputation for exceptional realism and believability.Ultracool protagonist JC Denton visits many detailed environments over the course of the story and the open nature of each one forms a basis for the game’s lasting appeal. Whether you storm into a hostage filled room guns blazing, enter quietly through an open window or hack the code lock on the front door; there are many different approaches to each situation you find yourself in.This is combined with a satisfying character progression system that allows JC to increase his proficiency in everything from firearms, lock picking, computer hacking and even swimming. Because of the range of non-violent solutions to each scenario, Deus Ex is often considered to be closer to an RPG than it is a straight shooter; something that was a very new and exciting prospect in 2000.In a similar vein to another PC classic Thief; Deus Ex blends stealth, gunplay and a mature cyberpunk setting to great effect and has created an enduring legacy for its legion of dedicated fans.The game’s final quarter is a bit weak though and many aspects of the story form a labyrinthine mess of conspiracy angles when you get down to it, but none of that spoils what is an excellent game and one rightly regarded for letting players take their own individual approach to the task at hand.Deus Ex is the game that taught other games how to grow up and reach a wider audience.Exceptional.Read the full retrospective at my blog »[www.celjaded.com] "

												This hybrid of genres (RPG, First Person Shooter, Stealth and Adventure) is a gem. Despite the years, is a very complex game and introduced a series of mechanics which are still praised today.PROS :- Incredible story (What begins as the simplest thing in the world, ends up becoming a story full of conspiracies and betrayals to the point of not knowing who to trust, followed by a climax that few games can reach).- The decisions you make along the adventure change the narrative of the ending.- Completely open-character to all missions (From the first to the last, you have multiple ways to fulfill your primary and secondary objectives).- Long campaign (If you dare to explore absolutely everything, you will ensure a minimum of 60 hours of gameplay).- Multiple options for character customization (Integration of augmentations that allows you to perform specific actions and skills that can be enhanced at different levels).- You can mold the character to fit your playing style (If you're a pacifist, you can create a stealthy character to avoid direct confrontation, or if you prefer to face the situation ala John Rambo, you can create a real killing machine).- Wide variety of weapons (From improvised weapons to non-lethal, knives, pistols, shotguns, rifles, bazookas, energy weapons, etc. Many of these, completely customizable in their performance).- Various options to interact with the NPC's (Resolving a situation by the way of the dialogue, intimidation or force. Your choice affects the opinion of other characters and their behavior towards the protagonist).- The exploration is encouraged (Many hidden areas that keep items, ammunition, experience points to spend, etc).- Features Multiplayer option (Amazingly for a game of these characteristics, you have the option to play in LAN or Internet. At the time of writing this Review, there were about 15 active servers with people in them).CONS :- Relatively small inventory (Although this is not necessarily a bad thing, but merely strategic. You must decide very well which items to carry).- Some bugs and graphical glitches (Textures that become invisible, walls that inexplicably you can go through in certain situations).An unforgettable story set in a Cyberpunk atmosphere of the mid-21st century. The multiple customization options added to the various narratives that you have for your style of play, ensures that the Single Player mode will be played more than once.My Score: 8.8/10Note : Played it on Windows XP - SP3			"

												Few games exist in this mortal plane that provide the degree of choice and freedom Deus Ex provides. Want to run around and bludgeon everyone on Liberty Island to death with a crowbar? Go ahead. Want to explode every dog in Hong Kong? Go ahead. The fact that this game came out in 2000 is mindboggling. Sure, the graphics look like♥♥♥♥♥ but the massive levels and sheer scope of the experience as a whole more than compensate. The ending(s) alone make for one of the most memorable choices in gaming history. Buy it.			"

												Need I say more? This is the best PC game of all time. Nuff said!For me, the best game of all time has to be Deus Ex. This game combines different genres (FPS, RPG, Stealth and action) into one and it was the very first piece of media that actually made me think about socio-political issues in real life. It also taught me the consequences of choice and how different choices can lead to opposite or even unexpected results. It might be a dated game by today’s standards, but this game actually respects the player by interacting with him/her through choices and liberty of gameplay to reach from point A to point B while maintaining the player grasped into the plot that is masterfully delivered and never feels unrealistic or over the top. It makes you think on the final outcome of all the choices and paths you have taken and can even make you second-guess yourself for doing it. This game teaches you that there is no right or wrong, just different ways to do things.			"

												""The best way to predict the future is to create it.""Even after a decade Deus Ex remains a masterpiece of visionary game development with a great storyline full of intrigue, political struggles and social commentary. The immersive atmosphere is rounded out by strong role-playing elements and fantastic music. In addition this game provides a broad spectrum of customization (e.g. weapons and bionic components), resulting in a high replayability. The only shortcoming comes in form of the clumsy combat system, which has not aged well.  Fun fact: A film adaptation based on the game was originally announced by Columbia Pictures in 2002, and the release date was scheduled for 2006, but the film never got past the scripting stage.  --My rating system consists of six categories in descending order of importance:-	Atmosphere-	Characters-	Details-	Tactical gameplay-	Story-	Combat & ControlsBased on the performance each category will receive one of the following grading: -	S-Rank: excellent-	A-Rank: very good-	B-Rank: solid-	C-Rank: satisfactory-	D-Rank: inferiorIf the S-Rank is awarded, a quote from the game or personal comment will be added as a token of my respect (in brackets).--Atmosphere: S-Rank(You've got ten seconds to beat it, before I add you to the list of NSF casualties.)Characters: S-Rank(Now everyone will see why I needed a skull-gun!)Details: S-Rank (I know your UNATCO killphrase: ‘Laputan Machine’.)Tactical gameplay: S-Rank (You can’t fight ideas with bullets.)Story: S-Rank (Trust no one.

												Note: All of these hours are played without any gameplay mods whatsoever. Probably 3 hours on GMDX and that's it. Everything else is the original game. One day soon I'll play some fan missions, maybe. Also this doesn't count the hours I've played on disk which too is a lot and I don't leave the game on without playing it, well purposely anyway.This is my fave game of all time and has been since younger childhood. The first time playing through this was the best experience in any game ever. Absolutely mind-blowing. I just wish I could reexperience playing it for the first time because by now I've played over 300 hours on it (including my disk). This and the Thief series are the most magical games to have a first playthrough of ever. This game has a lot of flaws that also add to its charm, so instead of the normal Pro's and Con's, I'm going to have a Charmy Flaw list as well.Pros:+Great sound design+The greatest soundtrack I've ever heard+Incredible writing and story+Great UI+Kick♥♥♥♥♥weapons (except the PS20)+Characters are extremely memorable+Heaps of interesting locations+Sub-plots and mini storylines+Optional sidequests are great+Non-linear, multiple outcomes, ways of doing things+Five playthroughs worth of stuff to find and then some (not exaggerating)+Perfect length (took me 22 hours first playthrough)+Which means awesome pacing+Multiplayer ways of playing, lethal, non-lethal, stealth, all-out, no augs etc.+Great dialogue system+Upgradeable skills+Lots of replayability+A really good roleplaying multiplayer (if you want it to be)+Shadow based and line of sight stealth system, Thief like but not invisible when in dark+Have to mention UI again, I mean, it's REALLY good+Feels like a real world (""Who will help the widow's son?"", ""Excuse me?"", ""Oh sorry, I thought you were someone else."")+Nice plotwist early on+Every character you meet is memorable, every one. That dude shouting holy stuff at Battery Park. That rude newspaper girl in Hong Kong. That annoying boy who's annoying to the rude girl in Hong Kong. That♥♥♥♥♥♥who keeps asking you stuff in Kell's Kitchen (Used Car Salesman?). Those two lesbians in the club in Hong Kong etc.+Great bossfights+Extremely moddable, just like every other UE1 game, even a baby could do it (except Rumi)+Will update review in the future+Great artdesignCons:-PS20 is useless-Most augmentations are useless-Difficulty gets a lot harder all of a sudden at the end-Default FOV is quite small-Graphics were getting decently out-of-date by 2000-Will update review in the futureFlaws/Charms:*♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice-acting here and there (The Aussie chicks)*Hearing footsteps through rooms*AI getting stuck opening doors*Will update review in the futureSound: 9/10Graphics: 6/10 (graphics were getting old by 2000, but the art-design holds up very well)Gameplay: 10/10Content/Replayability: 10/10Overall: 10/10I can't recommend this game enough.

												This is one of the best games I've ever played.It's an action/RPG first person game with a lot of different ways to play. You can go inside a building through the front door, or you can find a back entrance. You can hack computers, digital locks, and security consoles, but you can also get the password somewhere. You can pick locks, but you can get the key from somebody. You can kill your enemies, but you can just avoid encountering them at all.The level designs are just brilliant. They're big, but not huge. You can easily memorize them, so it's easy not to get lost. Some of the levels are visited more than once and it feels different everytime, yet you still remember the places.The graphics aren't amazing and they may look outdated, but they fit the atmosphere perfectly. The music is great and every location has its own soundtrack that fits to what you're currently doing.The story is great and a little bit complex with conspiracies here and there, but there's not much to tell without spoiling it. This game is set in 2052 and it takes place in a chaotic world filled with terrorists, drugs, diseases, and augmented humans. There's a lot of memorable characters in this game, and every single one of them has their own personality. You can kill some of the important characters but instead of failing the mission, it will change the story and you will have to face the consequences.In short, it's a great classic game with a great story and music that combines RPG, FPS, action, and stealth elements with a lot of different playstyles to choose.

												This classic was released in 2000, but you shouldn't be scared off by its age – on the contrary: Deus Ex is one of the cherries on the cake of pc gamings heyday; one of those titles you have to have played.Deus Ex offers a unique and fantastic storyline of conspiracies in a dystopic world, which was made so absolutely beautiful and authentic by all those many details you can discover: conversations, e-mails, newspapers, books, bulletin news, sidequests – you name it. I could write an endless text about how superb the story is, but I don't want to spoil anything and everyone should discover it for themselves.The gameplay also offers a great variety of possibilities to attain a goal. And that doesn’t limit to the question, if you should kill or avoid an enemy:  There is always more than one way and often more than two. And some of the consequences don't occur at once, but later in the game.Believe me: There is a reason why Deus Ex is always among the Top 10 of the best games of all time.			"

												This game is truly is a masterpiece in terms of everything a game has to offer.With a dynamic storyline, excellent gameplay, and a diverse cast of characters.  Not to mention with a beautiful soundtrack to accompany this game and lastly a well in-depth tutorial for players to easily understand. This game offers multiplayer for those curious enough (not sure if it's dead or still active).The only grip with this game but is easily fixed is the mouse senstivity and also when the game registers your PC in terms of what performance it should play on. Make sure you set them low when your in-game.One more thing don't play this game for very long you will feel dizzy and almost sick to your stomach. This is just a health concern and not an actual negative, just a caution.I highly recommend this game. So if you want a game with a dynamic storyline, characters, a worlds mythos and excellent gameplay get this game now.			"

												Great game. Must've blown away minds back in the early 2000's, where FPS were one route, one way to play. In Deus Ex, you freely get to complete objectives in your very own playstyle, be it stealth or guns blazing, or tapping into computers and turning bots and machine guns on to your side. The story is very immersive and interesting to play through, bringing up topics that conspiracy theorists and the average citizen round the world daily or at least spamodically discuss, such as one world government, the United Nations, and marital law and also FEMA.Thats about it really, the sound track is amazing, and i think the voice acting is good aswell. Speaking of graphics, this might not appeal to members of the younger generation such as myself, due to old game mechanics, and LOTS of complexity, but i really do urge people to try this game out, there's no other full fledged game out there like this and it really is one of a kind.There's also a huge modding community that's still active.

												It is essential that you play this game, if you are even remotely interested in any of the following:- Stealth- Role-playing games and character personalization- The world around you- First person shooters- Meaningful player choice- Conspiracies, poverty, plagues, high-power a**holes and other real-world issues- Political storms- Technology, human augmentation and AI- Complex, scarily realistic characters- Lemon-limeDeus Ex was a pioneer in so many aspects when it came out fourteen years ago. The radical choices you could make (one example: you can actually trot away from boss fights, like a hippie chasing a butterfly). The fact that the game lets you play any style you want: gun maniac to stealth hacker, superior smart-mouth to humble and reasonable agent, and anything in between. The near-perfect blend of shooter, stealth and true RPG elements. The intellectual coherence of the game's philosophical and political conversation, most of which is starkly valid today. And just when you least expect it, a subtle touch of perfectly balanced humour.I won't spoil a bit of this game's fantastic story, which is a complex OCEAN of meaningful events, each one offering enriching, frightening and stunning insights into the condition of the world and the nations that live in it.One issue: the crossbow is useless as a stealth weapon. If an enemy is hit with a tranquilizer dart, they run around screaming, shooting and activating alarms for several seconds before passing out. It's useful if you're doing a pacifist playthrough. For stealth, stick with the prod. pro- with the prod.Just please, please don't let the graphics put you off. The game is widely considered a strong contender for the best game of all time. Don't let your addiction to particle clouds and tessellation and ragdoll physics and 9-hour playthroughs keep you from experiencing this sublime game.			"

												First of all, WOW. This game defied all my expectations. I didn't expect to be given so many choices or so many possible endings, especially from a 14 year old game! It was engaging, challenging, moddable, and overall: enjoyable! You may be skeptical at first, but by the midway point you're intrigued. By the endgame, you're hooked! Personally, I have not used any mods, and I only completed one ending, but DANG. WHAT AN ENDING. If you enjoy games with serious plot, action, stealth, decision making, and laughable voice acting on all the non-essential characters, buy this game! $7 is a pittance compared to the mighty wealth of enjoyment you will get from this title. You will love this game!			"

												When I first started playing this game last year, I hated it. Not because of the aged graphics and slightly dated gameplay, no. It was because I had huge difficulties finishing even the first level. I didn't understand that the key in this game is to experiment, find a playstyle and weapon-combination that fits for you and most importantly try different routes to reach your goal. But once I understood all this, my experience with this game changed entirely... It became my favorite game of all time!It is extremely satisfying each and every time you complete your objectives in this game. This is for one main reason, which games of today seem to have forgotten:YOU completed the mission on your own, without being handheld by the game the whole time. You found your own route and tactic to reach the objective and complete it. You don't just get a minimap in this game, or follow a questmarker till you reach your objective. No, you have to gather information, maps or drawings. You have to make notes, complete sidequests and search for hidden (and a bit less hidden) areas and paths. Long story short, you really feel accomplishment because you were the one who did all these things, you weren't just following a marker. The gameplay of this game feels a bit old at times, but it is still fun and rather deep. You have a ton of different weapons, and they all fit to different playstyles. They all work pretty good, except for a FEW hit-detection issues with certain weapons. Augmentations are also a major part of the gameplay, but I'll let you figure out that part yourself :)You can complete a level however you want, and there are a TON of ways you can play. You can be stealthy, a ruthless killing machine or an invisible hacker, OR you can go with one of the countless different variations in between. It is a ton of fun, as you can play exactly as you like.I don't have much to say about the story, because it is epic, exciting and thought provoking, and I am afraid to spoil anything for potential new Deus Ex players. Just believe me, it is GOOD, and it changes according to your actions and choices throughout the game. It was mindblowing even it came out, and even today it stands out as one of the best stories gaming has to offer.This has already dragged on for too long, as I expect most people to have heard more than enough about thIs game to know it is an old masterpiece and a legend in the gaming industry. I really hope that, more people will experience this gem for the first time after reading this review. It is, and will probably keep being my favourite game of all time! :)P.S. The game also has a superb soundtrack, really good stuff!			"

												DEUS EX is a Role Playing Game with First Person Shooter elements in it, made in the year 2000 by Ion Storm and published by Warren Spector, releaced for the PC, using the Unreal 1 engine.This is the greatest game ever made of all time (PC)No I'm not kidding, lying, or even just saying that to signify it's importance or how great it is:This really IS the greatest videogame ever made for the PC.It has won over 200 GameOfTheYear awards, and many areas of videogame ideas and influence of even compleatly different generas can be traced back to Deus Ex.The concept for Deus Ex came from Ion Storm (Austin) being split into three groups:Group 1 was dedicated to creating the best PC exclusive FirstPersonShooter everGroup 2 consisted of people with a lot of experiance in RolePlayingGames, andGroup 3 mostly included people from Looking glass studios, whose recent success in Thief: the dark project, wanted to see a future version of their FPS Stealth game.And by combining the ideas and thoughts of all 3 groups, Ion Storm (Austin) created the greatest PC game of all time. And when you play it, you won't find it hard to believe.The plot is set in a dystopian world during the year 2052, and follows the rookie United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO) agent JC Denton (hint: YOU), as he sets out to combat terroist forces (the NSF), which have become increasingly prevalent in a world slipping ever further into chaos, through a highly contaigus viris called the Grey death, only curable by the vaxine Ambrosia. As the plot unfolds, Denton becomes entangled in a deep and ancient conspiracy, encountering various organizations (to say whom would spoil too much), conspiracies, lies and twists, that carry on throughout the whole game, as he travels through various environments and cities, from NewYork, to Rome, to Hong Kong, and manny more.The RolePayingGame parts include Upgrading skills and Augmentations to increase JC's effectivness in the field, and choosing diologe between characters, which not only effects the way characters treat you, but also the effects of the multiple endings, and the multiple roots and pathways PRIOR to said multiple endings.But the real inovation in Deus Ex lies within the open-endedness in the levels: It's not a sandbox game, but its levels have manny pathways to the objectives and manny ways to approch them. You can go in all guns blazing, which gun is up to you, or choose different weapons, Lethal or Non-lethal, and try to stealth through it, and because JC has an inventory system, this is possable, although that certain weapons take up a bigger space in the inventory slot, and the re-aranging of the items has created the name ""Inventory-Tetris"".Remember when I said Non-lethal? Yes it is possable. You can stun, or knock out enemies to make them unconsious, meaning you didn't kill them, or hack a security turret to kill them, meaning YOU didn't kill them. Also, you can skip past the Boss fights entirely, not killing them or knocking them out.Heck, it won a guiness world record for being able to compleate the game and only have to kill 2 PEOPLE.It's that kind of deph you will find here.Obviously, it's not just stealth, and a few areas require you to shoot through them, and the FPS elements are pretty good:There's no iron-sights since they hadn't been invented at the time, although you can upgrade some weapons to have a scope on them, although if you aren't trained in these areas, your aim and crosshair will fumble and spread all over the place. There's no regenerating-health (F that cow-waste) or Heath-bar per say. Damage is taken through to the different parts of your body. Too manny arm shots & you're gonna struggle with aiming. Too manny leg shots, and you're gonna have trouble with movment. Health is replenished by using Med-kits on the different body parts, eating food found in certain places (i.e a drinking fountain or resteraunt), or using Androids found in a few places in various environmentsAnd the MUSIC: holy heck the MUSIC. Just look up the Unatco theme on YouTube, and you'll see how AMAZING the music is.It was composed by Alexander Brandon, who also did the Unreal tournament music, and a few others I haven't listed. OK...Now I've praised Deus Ex long enough, time to get into the problems.It's not perfect. When I say best PC game of all time, I mean that all the things good about it outweigh the bad parts so much, that it makes it the best Pc game of all time: it's THAT good.The first problem is for the modern era: it has aged like absolute COW-WASTE. The visuals are very dated, & it wasn't ground-breaking for it's time either, and that can put off a lot of first-timers.The second problem is with the design choices:Certain skills & augmentations are downright USELESS.Ask any Deus Ex veteran about the ""Swimming"" skill, and they'll instantly get what you mean. The skill is never needed to progress ANYWHERE in the game. This is the same-ish issue with ""Environment training"", because being able to use radioactive suits, dull effects of poisons, and things of that nature isn't that helpful.The skill for ""Melee weapons"" is also debatable in usefullness, because half-way through the game you are given a powerful sword that can kill most enemies in 1-2 hits.Stealth can be a bit glitchy with certain weapons downright wierd.The Crossbow with tranquilliser rounds for instance:The effects on the poison depend on where it hits the body. If it hits the head, it takes 1-4 seconds to pass out. Anywhere else and it takes 5-12 seconds, during which time the enemy can run around, warn other people, set off alarms, & be a downright pain.Also, the final problem, and this is directed at YOU if you plan on getting this, is that it has a VERY small accessabuillty factor.It can be hard to get into, if first-timers don't know most of the flaws.They read all of the reviews saying how awesome it is, and load up the game, expecting a good old time; YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO. They'll see the character creation screen, put a few points into lethal weapons, and gun handling, expecting to shoot their way through the first mission, only to find themselves out of ammo, and not killing anything.People who expect to play through the game, and listen to all the audio diologes, collect every weapon, hack all the security cameras, and upgrade everything on the first playthrough; It will JUST NOT HAPPEN the first playthrough.You may get into the universe, and master everything in the game, but this WILL NOT happen during your first playthrough.But at the end of the day, Deus Ex still stands the tests of time, and deserves ALL of those GOTY awards it got.You know the saying with Deus Ex? Every time you mention it, someone re-installls it? Yeah, there's a reason for that.So the 2 big questions are:Is it Really the best game ever made of all time on PC? andShould you play it?To answer both those questions simply: YES*And I said Yes with the asterix ( * ) as a disclaimer for first timers.Because there are problems with it that you should watch out for, but get over them, and there really hasn't been a better game then this.Deus Ex also had 2 sequels: Invisible war, and Human Revolution (the latter better well known), and while fans will argue till their mouths are sore over which is better, out of the 3, Deus Ex is the best of them.I  EXTREMALY HIGHLY recommend this game to pretty much anyone into this.6/5			"

If you don't like it, I don't like you.-Like The Matrix in art style.-Like cyber punk mixed with conspiracies.-Go stealthy, lethal or non-lethal--find the beam sword.-Go loud, kill everything! Get a GEP GUN!-Upgrade guns, long before it was the cool thing to do.-Be diplomatic. Talk their asses off!Most important of all: your vision is augmented; always wear sunglasses at night.			"

												YES, Deus Ex was and still is great.. Hard for me to say though, because my impression of it is from 2000, not current. Even back then it's graphics were a bit ugly but Deus wasn't about graphics, graphics didn't make Deus Ex the game that made video games worth playing. It wasn't just ""Here's a firearm now go kill whatever you simple-minded.... NO, Deus Ex was much more than that..    Deus Ex was all about the large world to explore and investigate. To play it the way you wanted to play. You didn't have to be a homicidal maniac, you could use stealth and wit. Afterall Deus Ex was/is about ambiance and if you go around killing all the NPC's is does lose the ambiance. It also impacts the storyline..			"

												My best game ever ... and a GOTY one :)I have enjoyed it since early 2000s and finished it from scratch about 10 times! Last time was in 2013 ^^As each game of the series, you will move in an awesome cyberpunk environment, which is as complex and consistent as in the best SF books. Cyberpunk games are usually really interesting because they often deal with a lot of interesting concepts such as transhumanism, bioethics, economy and law.### Pros:- Good story & great cyberpunk environment involving corporations, secret societies, viral diseases and charismatic characters- FPS game with many weapons and their modification, an inventory management system and physical augmentation upgrades (regeneration, stealth, moving speed)- Large number of side quests (you have to speak with most NPC to find them)- Play as a stealthy ninja or Rambo since you can choose your game style- Your choices will have major consequences on the subsequent missions (e.g. death or survival of main characters, long or very quick boss fights ...)- Difficult game in realistic mode, especially at the beginning since you start as a “noob agent”- You will not finish it in 10h (by contrast to many recent expensive bull$hit games) and there are several endings### Cons:- Graphics are pretty poor from a 2014 point of view since the game is OLD ... however, the fan community released mods (NewVision + HDTP) to improve textures and resolution :)- Use the hardest difficulty since the AI can be improvable### Conclusion:You must have Deus Ex in your games library ... just buy it in sales for less than 2 bucks ^^19/20			"

												There is a reason why people commonly use phrases like ""every time you mention it, someone reinstalls the game"" and ""best game of all time"" when it comes to this game - the hype is justified for a reason.Released in 2000, Deus Ex has stood the test of time thanks to its innovative gameplay concepts, engrossing storyline and well-written characters, both major and minor. The game puts you into the shoes of JC Denton, a government operative who is thrust into a world of violence, politics and intrigue while struggling to figure out who to trust.The game combines elements of an FPS with an RPG-style management and upgrade system, well-written and developed characters and a variety of interesting locales to create an experience that is still unmatched. Whether you're searching through the streets of New York to take down a generator, investigating a conspiracy in a high-rise office building in Hong Kong or trying to stop a missile launch in the middle of the desert, the game throws a variety of situations at the player in the context of a major global conspiracy.One thing I've always enjoyed about the story, and which keeps me coming back time and time again to replay it, is the range of possible solutions (and responses) to various problems faced in the game world. You can do things that seem counterintuitive or even absurd, and the game will recognize and praise/admonish you for your actions. Want to kill that nosy reporter, despite the fact that no one has asked you to? The game recognizes it. Want to skip the first mission by throwing a gas grenade at the front door of UNATCO HQ? The NPC's remark on it. Wait too long to talk to an NPC? They may have different introductory dialogue based on when you visit them.Likewise, the characters are very well-written, and have actions that extend beyond conversations with the player and into e-mails, newspapers and books found around the game world. All this material is optional, and players can skip it as they so choose.The combat and NPC reaction to damage can come off as a bit ""stiff"" to modern audiences, but the movement and reaction system in general still holds up quite well, with enemies and NPC's reacting to damage and running away if they are hurt, stopping to reload and changing their firing position or chasing after the player during combat.If there's anything I can criticize this game for (and that's very hard to do), the GOTY does introduce a couple of musical/ambient sound bugs that can lead to multiple pieces of music playing in the same level. Besides that, though, this is still the same tried-and-true Deus Ex experience - you'll play it for the deep characters and storyline, and stay for the different gameplay approaches and solutions (not to mention all of the mods and total conversions!).Deus Ex is a classic, and it's a game I'm honored to have both in my physical and Steam library.

												One of the greatest and most intricately designed RPG's of all time, Deus Ex offers dynamic gameplay which allows you to approach in-game situations how you please, the levels are sandbox styled and consist of non-linear layouts which span multiple different paths to your objectives giving you the freedom to explore and find your own way  through levels depending on how you like to play. Overall this is one of the greatest games ever made, do not be thrown off by the 'dated' visuals (which I find amazing and better than modern games but newer generations might disagree) otherwise you'll be missing out on a masterpiece!

												So Deus Ex.The definitive PC experience. One of few games which wouldn't work on consoles at all.It's a cyber-punk First Person Role Playing Game in which you play as a cybernetically augmented special agent JC Denton on a mission to defeat a terrorist organization, all while a elaborate conspiracy uncovers itself through the course of the game. The game starts with our hero arriving onto the Liberty Island, NYC. There, he has to free a captured agent and take the terrorist leader into custody. It is a simple and fairly easy mission, which really feels like a sandbox, where you can test different equipment, see which elimination method you prefer etc. All the levels are open and free to explore, and the game rewards you with useful items and extra skill points you can use to improve JC if you do so. There are always at least 2 ways to get somewhere, even when NPC's tell you there is only one way. You need to be resourceful, and outsmart your oponents. The game shows a staggering amount of detail, as every little thing you do affects dialog and NPC reactions. Walk into the lady's restroom? Get scolded by your boss for doing so.Don't give a hotel owner in distress a pistol? Well, you better come to him when JoJo shows up or he will die.You can talk to many different NPC's to get intel, which will help you in your mission. What seems like a simple bum, can give you info about a secret passage, giving you a chance to avoid sniper fire. Deus Ex's soundtrack is incredible; It's a perfect exaple of old video game OST's: Powerful, catchy and memorable, the kind you'll want to stand in place and just listen to. A fantastic thing the game did, was remix the game's main theme using church organs in the cathedral level.The game itself tackles serious problems, such as which is better: globalisation or isolation, martial law or complete anarchy. Now, let's get into gameplay. The gunplay is very outdated, it feels fairly sluggish and not rewarding. The stealth system, while not perfect, is enjoyable. The augmentation system enchances the gameplay a lot, by giving you lots of new fun abilities, such as higher jumps, stronger hits, or even a remotely controlled spybot with a EMP attack.Overall, the game is great. The story gets deep, and while outdated, the mechanics are lots of fun. Subjectively, I'd say You should really check it out if you haven't.			"

												About 2 weeks ago, I bought the original Deus Ex and Deus Ex: Human Revolution: Director's Cut.  Really, I was buying Human Revolution, since that was the game I was really interested in.  I bought Deus Ex on a side thought, as it was $1.39 and all the old gamers kept saying ""It's a masterpiece!""  Besides, I wasn't sure that Human Revolution would run on my potato PC.2 weeks later, I finished the game, and for a couple minutes just stared at my computer screen saying ""Wow"".  I know realize that Deus Ex is indeed a masterpiece...although now that term seems inadequate.Set in 2052, Deus Ex follows the story of JC Denton, nano-augmented agent for UNATCO, the United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition.  Basically, the world's gone to heck in a handbasket.  A horribly lethal virus, the Gray Death, has spread throughout the world.  UNATCO controls the distribution of the virus, but, as it is in short supply, UNATCO makes sure that the vaccine gets to the rich and powerful, the ones deemed ""vital to society"".  The lower classes have no options, and millions of them die on the streets.  As a result of the lower classes's poor treatment, multiple terrorist groups have sprung up, including the NSF in America and Silhouette in France.  As a member of the ANTI-TERRORIST COALITION, your first missions as JC are to fight the NSF in search of a stolen shipment of Gray Death vaccine, (known as Ambrosia).  Immediately, the games environment perfectly fits the bill.  The entire game is at night, or soon before morning, adding to the dark environment of the world.  On the streets of New York City, it seems that the only people are either terrorists, police, or bums.  The entire city feels oppressed and dangerous.  But the game doesn't stop there.  As events progress and truths are revealed, JC travels across the entire world, visiting such places as Hong Kong, Paris, and the famous Area 51.  There are certain open-world areas, although largely without the side-quests that were found in the prequel.  However, this is where Deus Ex's greatest strength is: freedom.The open areas of Deus Ex are very large, much larger than anything we saw in Human Revolution.  Even the linear levels  were so open that I, in multiple cases, had to keep a rule to make sure I covered anything.  The same is true for the gameplay.  Within a level, there are multiple places to enter a place, achieve an objective.  Unlike games of its time like Half-Life, screwing something up in Deus Ex does not mean it's time to reload from the last save.  Even though it is sometimes simpler to do it the intended way, Ion Storm made a way to do it another way.  I'm sure that another player did something completely different then me based on their playstyle, weapons, resources, skills, and augs. The game does have some flaws.  The graphics are incredibly dated.  Upon first installing the game, the game had poor lighting, making it nearly impossible to see in some areas.  In addition, some of the augs are pretty useless, being useful once or twice but never being worth purchasing again.  Other than that though, I can't find a significant flaw with the game.This game is completely worth the price.  There is no reason not to get it.  9.5/10.			"

												Do yourself a favor and buy this game if you're even slightly interested. Absolutely incredible game. Timeless level design and story,Pros+ Absolutely tons of customization options; with such variety, few people can really boast that they have played the same game twice+ Narrative is both mature and showcases an impressive amount of depth+ Augmentations, also, offer great freedom in character tailoring; some are arguably more useful than others, but overall the sense of freedom inherent in this mechanic does well to complement the same freedom found throughout the rest of the game+ Modular damage; limbs and body parts experience damage separately, and this translates competently to gameplay (eg. taking too much damage in a leg will result in poor movement)+ The player is offered spectacular freedom in how level objectives and advancement are to be handled+ Level design is applaudable; everything flows well from one area to another, and layouts are generally sensible+ Soundtrack is absolutely fantastic; sets the mood, doesn't necessarily distract, and stays with you when the game is off+ Dialogue and writing is absolutely superb; this is easily one of the better aspects of the game, and it presents well even todayCons- Speed/compatibility issue; this may not affect everyone, but there is an issue with compatibility on modern machines which causes overall gamespeed to increase drastically (there is a workaround, but it's something of a hassle to fix)- Visuals and animations really show their age; these don't hold up well today, but it's not bad enough to detract from the overall experience- Voice-acting, though it can be quite good, is a mostly underwhelming effort; some voice actors go as far as to be terrible "

												Fun Fact: A woman put this game on a chip and implanted i in her skin, that's how much she loved it.Deus Ex, which many of you probably know due to the infamous ""Bomb"" scene, is a true revolutionary by the literal definition. It's a game people seem to respect more than enjoy, but I disagree. It's probably jsut me, but I don't see its age at all, and I still consider to have the best replay value I've ever experienced with a game. Why is that? One simple word, choice. Deus Ex isn't a perfect game. Hell, it has more flaws than I can list, but it does what no other game I've played outside of anything Eidos has made, it gives true free choice, no illusions, no cop-outs, no story routes that converge, true freedom. It counters the world of the game. Deus Ex takes place in a dystopic United States, whose government has seized control of the planet. Paranoia plagues this world after terrorists attacked New York and destroyed the Twin Towers and the Statue of Liberty (This game was made in 2000, what a coincidence) and an anti-terrorist organization named UNATCO polices the world against the terrorist organization, the NSF. You are JC Denton, a cyborg recruit for UNATCO. A plague called the Black Death sweeps the globe, killing off the Proletariat, its cure in the hands of a select few in power. Suspicions are raised, questions are asked, paranoia grows. Is the government sacrificing freedom for safety? Where has this plague come from? What is the true intention of UNATCO? And that's about all I can say without spoiling. The game has enough twists and turns to make even M. Night Shaymalan blush. The game is everything you'd expect from a dystopic sci-fi fiction combined. Everything is thrown into the melting pot of conspiracy: the MIB, Illuminati, the Templars, evil corporations, Area 51, hushed up alien landings, gene-splicing experiments, the debate of man VS cyborg, and self aware AI are all crucial to the plot. The result leaves you as paranoid and confused as any other person living in this time, and the morality of good VS evil become decisively grey. There is unbound choice and freedom in Deus Ex. Being an RPG that just so happens to be in first person, the game doesn't have a black and white good or evil morality system. Instead, the storyline judges you from the sidelines in secret. The choices you make don't really matter (Some are a tad more advantageous) and none prevent you from unlocking a new skill or getting a new ending. There are an infinite ways to solve a scenario. Facing a boss? You can run away! You can knock them out if you wish (it is entirely possible to beat the game without killing anyone if you try hard enough). Need to break into a building? You can kill everyone and walk in, you can crawl through nearby sewers, you can hack the security to turn on the guards or disable it altogether, the list goes on. Deus Ex is also something most modern games struggle to be, it's balanced. Throughout the game you can score new Augmentations, cyborg superpowers. Each Aug is a choice between two different play styles. Do you want the Aug that makes your footsteps silent or do you want the one that makes you run faster and jump higher (Go with the 2nd actually, it is so much more beneficial for creative players)? Being an old RPG shooter, EVERYTHING requires skill points, but unlike System Shock 2 (A very similar game) the game doesn't punish you for investing in other skills (Though if you stupid and just fully max Poison Resistance and Swimming then you're ♥♥♥♥ed) because each scenario can be solved in so many ways and each way rewards a different playstyle. The choices in Deus Ex are some of the hardest I've ever had to make in any game. No, no choice gives you a different gun or anything and they don't affect the game, but there's deep rooted philosophical questions and ideals tied to every choice. The title is derived from ""Deus Ex Machina"", ""God of the Machine"", which means that no matter how hopeless a scenario is, something good will come out of it. That being said, I can not think of a more ironic title for a game as this one. Nothing good comes out of Deus Ex, and each dilemma typically involves judging the fate of mass groups or even few individuals between two evils. Do I allow this terminally ill man suspended in stasis to live with the hope that he can one day recover or do I put him out of his misery? It doesn't affect the game at all, but it's still one of the most haunting decisions I've ever made in a vidya. And that's the genius of Deus Ex, it's a game that sticks. It's story is so massive and so deeply rooted in real life conspiracy and philosophy that it's impossible to decipher in one go. Deus Ex tells a story most films struggle to, it is a sprawling epic that hits hard and never misses. Each little choice feeds into our larger and ever growing fears of our privacy being seized, secret oligarchies, tyranny, anarchy, and forces us ourselves to ask the most important question, ""s there any better alternative in a world as ♥♥♥♥ed as ours?"" The struggle of JC is one I will never forget, and the game itself created the core of modern gaming to say the last. 14 years later and games, and even the creators of the game itself, are still struggling to surpass Deus Ex. It still has the best and most established writing I've encountered in a video game while also allowing for free choice and having the storyline mold around the player. The game's penultimate moment is choosing between three possible endings, and it's still the single hardest decision I've ever encountered in gaming. Each one is dark and depressing but a necessary evil in some eyes and all 3 tie in different philosophical views on humanity and the state of the United States, which become more relevant with each passing day. It is a given that the difficulty curve is beyond ridiculous and it takes a heavy investment to know how to create your own style, but it's well worth it. There's an old saying on ♥♥♥♥♥ and is in fact written in the Rules of the Internet, ""Every time you mention Deus Ex someone will re-instlal it"". But I find this gross, as I can never imagine uninstalling it in the first place. It has been and will probably always be my favourite video game, and what I consider to be among the very top greatest games ever made. I don't rate games but if I had to it'd probably be 9/10, the difficulty curve is Satanic on a first playthrough and the voice acting (Specifically in Hong Kong) at times is hammy at best. But that adds to the charm to me, but I know it isn't universal. Also, the soundtrack is beyond Godly,

												Deus Ex is my favorite video game of all time.You play as JC Denton, a man whose body was augmented with nanomachines. He works for an anti-terrorist organization called UNATCO, and is sent on various missions. However, everything is not as it seems.I don't want to spoil the story, so I'll just leave it at that.The gameplay is brilliant. Typically, there are multiple ways you can go about doing any given task. In the first level alone, you can kill the NSF terrorists, or simply sneak past them. Get the code, disable the security, and go in through the front door, or sneak in through a back entrance. Save Gunther, or skip out on doing so. The first level isn't as good as I'm making it out to be, though - it's honestly one of this game's flaws.Speaking of flaws, the game's AI and graphics haven't held up well since its initial release, and the voice acting is... to say the least, pretty bad. Certain sidequests in the game feel unrewarding (with one of them not even rewarding you properly at all, due to a bug.) The weapons aren't very balanced, with the default pistol, GEP gun, and a certain melee weapon I won't spoil the existence of being incredibly overpowered.The game's narrative and storytelling are both incredible by video game standards. It's full of twists and hidden details (a plot-important NPC makes a brief, difficult-to-spot cameo very early on), a lot can be learned about the game's lore from reading notes lying around, hacking into people's computers and reading their email, and just talking to everyone you see. The game does a good job of building its world through the dialogue of random, otherwise unimportant NPCs. Honestly, I wish modern gaming could do things like this. Even the prequel, Human Revolution, didn't get it quite right - Every single NPC feels the need to talk about current events, augmentation, et cetera, whereas the original tended to focus more on other things.On top of all this, the replay value is absolutely insane! Every time you play through the game, things can go very different from the last. Each time, you'll often find things you didn't know existed in your previous playthrough. There are so many ways to play through it that it's worth it to just try everything at least once!Honestly, this game is one of the few I would give a 10/10 rating to. Everyone needs to play this game at least once.BE WARNED: To play this game on modern systems, you will need to get a patch called Deus Exe. This can be obtained here: http://kentie.net/article/dxguide/ Without it, the game will crash on startup.			"

												Perfect balance between FPS, Stealth, RPG and Adventure genres, the fact the Deus Ex was released 11 years ago puts almost every recent games to shame. The cyberpunk/conspiracy story by itself is a narrative masterpiece, so if you haven't played it yet, you ARE a moron.If you choose to rise from the shadow of stupidity, follow the path of enlightenment and install this game, there are great mods around to make it shine even brighter. Do it... do it NOW!!!			"

												Cant praise this game enough. Endless replayability and choices are meaningful, characters are engaging and multiple endings make this a must own. Graphics are quite dated, even for its time but it doesn't detract from the game in the slightest.The only drawback is that it is unlikely that there will be another game like this. It is truly unique in its presentation and use of topics such as nationalism, terrorism, corporate greed and conspiracy theories without sounding cliche'. Nor does it pander to the dumbed down audience that only want to shoot first and think never.11/10 would commit corporate espionage again.			"

												A stealth rpg fps cyberpunk epic if ever such a thing existed. Deus Ex does what few games do, blend so many genres together in a meaningful way within its game world. The story works perfectly pulling no punches and drawing you deeper away from the reality you perceieve and towards alternative future where everyone comes with a question and not all have answers. The characters are well written and heartfelt and the choices you make impact gameplay in so many ways. The gameplay itself however is heavily stealth emphasised and the areas can get confusing so be prepared to bring up a walkthrough for some of the different areas. Overall, Deus Ex is a gem so far ahead of its time it almost seems modern.			"

												Fun Fact: A woman put this game on a chip and implanted i in her skin, that's how much she loved it.Deus Ex, which many of you probably know due to the infamous ""Bomb"" scene, is a true revolutionary by the literal definition. It's a game people seem to respect more than enjoy, but I disagree. It's probably jsut me, but I don't see its age at all, and I still consider to have the best replay value I've ever experienced with a game. Why is that? One simple word, choice. Deus Ex isn't a perfect game. Hell, it has more flaws than I can list, but it does what no other game I've played outside of anything Eidos has made, it gives true free choice, no illusions, no cop-outs, no story routes that converge, true freedom. It counters the world of the game. Deus Ex takes place in a dystopic United States, whose government has seized control of the planet. Paranoia plagues this world after terrorists attacked New York and destroyed the Twin Towers and the Statue of Liberty (This game was made in 2000, what a coincidence) and an anti-terrorist organization named UNATCO polices the world against the terrorist organization, the NSF. You are JC Denton, a cyborg recruit for UNATCO. A plague called the Black Death sweeps the globe, killing off the Proletariat, its cure in the hands of a select few in power. Suspicions are raised, questions are asked, paranoia grows. Is the government sacrificing freedom for safety? Where has this plague come from? What is the true intention of UNATCO? And that's about all I can say without spoiling. The game has enough twists and turns to make even M. Night Shaymalan blush. The game is everything you'd expect from a dystopic sci-fi fiction combined. Everything is thrown into the melting pot of conspiracy: the MIB, Illuminati, the Templars, evil corporations, Area 51, hushed up alien landings, gene-splicing experiments, the debate of man VS cyborg, and self aware AI are all crucial to the plot. The result leaves you as paranoid and confused as any other person living in this time, and the morality of good VS evil become decisively grey. There is unbound choice and freedom in Deus Ex. Being an RPG that just so happens to be in first person, the game doesn't have a black and white good or evil morality system. Instead, the storyline judges you from the sidelines in secret. The choices you make don't really matter (Some are a tad more advantageous) and none prevent you from unlocking a new skill or getting a new ending. There are an infinite ways to solve a scenario. Facing a boss? You can run away! You can knock them out if you wish (it is entirely possible to beat the game without killing anyone if you try hard enough). Need to break into a building? You can kill everyone and walk in, you can crawl through nearby sewers, you can hack the security to turn on the guards or disable it altogether, the list goes on. Deus Ex is also something most modern games struggle to be, it's balanced. Throughout the game you can score new Augmentations, cyborg superpowers. Each Aug is a choice between two different play styles. Do you want the Aug that makes your footsteps silent or do you want the one that makes you run faster and jump higher (Go with the 2nd actually, it is so much more beneficial for creative players)? Being an old RPG shooter, EVERYTHING requires skill points, but unlike System Shock 2 (A very similar game) the game doesn't punish you for investing in other skills (Though if you stupid and just fully max Poison Resistance and Swimming then you're ♥♥♥♥ed) because each scenario can be solved in so many ways and each way rewards a different playstyle.

It doesn't affect the game at all, but it's still one of the most haunting decisions I've ever made in a vidya. And that's the genius of Deus Ex, it's a game that sticks.

Each little choice feeds into our larger and ever growing fears of our privacy being seized, secret oligarchies, tyranny, anarchy, and forces us ourselves to ask the most important question, ""s there any better alternative in a world as ♥♥♥♥ed as ours?"" The struggle of JC is one I will never forget, and the game itself created the core of modern gaming to say the last. 14 years later and games, and even the creators of the game itself, are still struggling to surpass Deus Ex.

												Even if it's not the best game ever made (and you can make an incredibly strong case for it), Deus Ex is, in 2016, without a doubt the most influential when it comes to modern game design. It was the first game to well and truly demonstrate the potential of ""immersive sim"", a term that you'll read a lot when researching this game. And it's just a fun, breathtaking game. Bold and ambitious and sprawling and surprising. And by God, it holds up.Have you played a game in which you come across an overheard conversation between two guards? Or read a newspaper article or character diary laying around? Or experienced an unexpected consequence of an action you took? Or found a starting-level combination safe with the key containing the letters 0 4 5 and 1? That game owes a heavy debt to Deus Ex. System Shock had audio diaries in '94, RPGs had choices and consequences, but the vision of Deus Ex is a living world, a world that is not just a playground for the character you control but a place where people have to live while you are out busting heads. Combat can and will break out in any setting, but the game shines in Hell's Kitchen. Return from defusing (or detonating) a few hostage situations and you're dumped on the streets of Manhattan, where people are walking around, trying to survive. It feels like a shell of a city because it is - a plague is spreading, jobs are drying up, people are giving up. The game doesn't come out and tell you this in big block letters, you just have to look around and you know (environmental storytelling is old hat in big-budget 2016 games, it was unheard of in DX times). Go to the bar and buy a cold beer for a guy on the job, try to get the bartender to open up about her cyborg implants. Go to the free clinic, where people are talking about the ongoing civil war and waiting to die of sickness. Break into a random apartment and find the bodies of overdose cases. Hack into ATMs and steal cash. Talk to vagrants on the street about how their friends have been vanishing in the sewers...Most of the game is like this - you play as JC Denton, rookie counter-terrorist, who stumbles onto a global conspiracy. Every ""hub level"" (Hell's Kitchen initially, but there are others) has a central objective, something you have to learn or someone you have to deal with, but you're not given direct instruction on how to accomplish it. You're dropped on the curb and left to figure it out, by helping people who live around it or gunning down resistance or just studying the levels and finding the air ducts (thank Deus Ex for how common they are now) and trapped back doors, and using your skills or your superpowered jumping legs to access them, then go in guns blazing or in and out like a cat burglar. And Deus Ex's most celebrated innovation, so imitated in later games, was the ability to go non-lethal, by sneaking past or using tranquilizer darts or knocking people out with a baton (the last is much harder than the first two). If you don't kill anyone, the game will notice and react, at least in the early-to-mid game.Gameplay-wise, there are some learning curves - Deus Ex uses an RPG system for its combat, meaning if you don't invest in a rifle skill (using points earned from completing objectives or for finding things off the beaten path), you're going to have to sit and steady your aim for a few seconds if you want to hit anything closer than arm's length. The stealth system is functional but rudimentary - it's mostly about line of sight, but sound and light levels factor in even though you have to play them by ear. It is possible and even advisable to stick with a pistol through the entire game (the pros, however, choose the GEP Gun).Flaws? There are some. The voice acting is horrible (and eventually, vaguely racist) but at a certain point, it loops around to being great, one of the game's charms (""what a shame""). Some skills are less useful than others. Knocking someone out with a baton requires a head hit from behind which is remarkably frustrating to achieve. And the story, as it expands into epic scope, loses reactivity and some of the Immersive Sim qualities that made it so revolutionary. But it is indeed epic in scope. They sold the demo on CD at Target back in the day, and there was so much stuff in it that I was convinced for awhile that I'd bought the whole thing for cheap. The game is never less than incredible, always showing you new things, throwing dramatic plot curves and more formidable challenges at you. The soundtrack is pure MIDI synth and befitting the cyberpunk setting, with some wonderful (if proggy) tracks.And the replayability? Believe the hype. The game takes choice more seriously than nearly any other game does, and by extension, more than most players do. There is a scene in which you are cornered by your enemies and a friend tells you to run while they stay behind - when I first played, I thought ""this is a game and a well-worn action movie trope, clearly I'll die if I don't do what they say"". I left, and later on I found the friend's dead body. Five IRL years later, I decide to replay the game for the nth time and think ""You know what? I'm going to take down as many as these mooks as I can before they kill me."" So I didn't run, and I killed all the attackers, and the friend lived to show up again, hours later, in a spot where every single playtime before I had run into a conversation about the dead friend. When people say they're still discovering things in Deus Ex, believe them.Deus Ex very slowly came to become the most influential game in AAA development. Games that once would have taken after straight-up shooters like Doom or ""atmospheric"" shooters like Half-Life have slowly begun to emulate its storytelling in key ways, jump-started by Bioshock's evocation of DX environmental storytelling. Many games have tried, in their own ways, to pay tribute to Deus Ex. Dishonored and Dishonored 2 probably come the closest in terms of going whole-hog in recreating the magic, but they don't quite get there, as good as they are. Alpha Protocol takes its bravery with regard to choice and consequence to new levels. And the Square Enix prequels, well, they're love letters, but they lack the fundamental boldness of spirit, the risk-taking, that make Deux Ex what it is.This game costs you almost nothing now, and once you acclimate to the controls and visuals and rhythms of gameplay, it will reward you, and if you're open to it, you will join its considerable cult. It is an undeniable achievement, a grail of design but also a hell of a game to experience. If you haven't tried it, try it. Choose the albino JC, take the computer skill, and walk into the ladies' bathroom when you get back to base. You will become a believer.			"

												Some words of warning: this game looks and feels its age.  Graphics are really poor by modern standards and even at the time I hated the feel of the modified Unreal v1 Engine that this game uses, so those who put a high premium on look and feel should stay away.If, however, you can tolerate these shortcomings, you should know that everything that made Deus Ex one of the best games of all time is still intact.  This game pioneered open-ended gameplay and still does it better than most modern imitators: the level design and character creation system enable players of every persuasion to meaningfully approach the game with their own style.  For example: some bosses can be insta-killed through dialogue if thorough players found, via hacking, the necessary code words.  You can even kill everyone that the game's plot absolutely cannot do without, and characters will react accordingly.  The plot is rich and the world is immersive, with secrets that cannot be discovered by players of one build or other, creating a sense of credibility - like Dark Souls (my other favourite game ever), Deux Ex doesn't willingly give up all its treasures, but demands to be explored.In summary, this game started a genre, and it's still the paradigm of the action/RPG because it does so many important things so much better than its modern imitators.  If you're a fan of immersive, reactive action/RPGs, you NEED to play Deus Ex.			"

												It feels a bit redundant for me to recommend this game to people, but then again why shouldn't I do it over and over again and again.Do you like FPSes?  Do you like RPGs with character and equipment upgrade systems, as well as pseudo-magic systems?  Do you enjoy multiple game paths?  Conspiracies?  Futuristic settings?  Stealth gameplay?  If you answered yes to any two of those.... Get. This. Game.Deus Ex is a classic, in the sense that it is a huge milestone for PC gaming overall.  It seamlessly blends FPS and RPG elements of the day into a combined experience which resonated so well it became a standard in itself.  Newer games like Borderlands, Fallout 3/New Vegas, the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, even Oblivion and Skyrim use much the same formula.  Deus Ex may not be the origin of that formula, but it is definitely one of the better implementations of it.  Dozens of games have tried and failed to recreate that balance of elements... sadly including some of the Deus Ex sequels.What makes this game get such a strong recommendation from me though is the replay value.  Quite simply the game is so densely packed with content and secrets that you can have played the game for literally years and completely miss certain bits of dialog or secrets.  Add to that the alternate playthrough methods opened up by carrying different weaponry, investing in different skills, selecting different augmentations, and its easy to see why the concept of spending years playing this game is not far-fetched at all.  Don't let my apparent play-time fool you; I've had the game since it was originally released, and if Steam counted that play-time it would be in the thousands of hours.In short, if you don't have it already, get this game.  Play it once.  Maybe it play it again.  Then, once you're hooked, get a mod that enhances and/or fixes the game and play it again.  Repeat for the next 1-3 years of your life at a minimum.  The last part is likely not optional once you complete the first two steps.			"

												If I had to go back to my teenage years and choose one, and only one, game that shaped my mindset and outlook on the world at large, it would be a close contest with Deus Ex and System Shock 2. Deus Ex is eerily more relevant today than it has ever been - released in the summer of 2000 and writing this review with the hindsight of 15 years, in-game you won't see the World Trade Center in the New York skyline, you'll read newspapers about martial law being declared in the United States, and deal with a global oligarchical conspiracy that intends to cull the population of the planet through a controlled epidemic. The themes and ideas presented in Deus Ex are not for the light of heart, and perfect for the skeptic and those that realize that what you're presented with on the evening news is anything but the whole, true, real picture. All the world's a stage, and Deus Ex illustrates that magnificently. Deus Ex is an arguably timeless video game that transcends the medium into something much more than a way to spend a few hours shooting bad guys. It is a thought provoking and radical experience that changed my life, much as a masterfully written novel would.It's time for my 3-4 year annual playthrough. Why contain it?			"

												Like the reviews and description suggest, perfect mix of combat, stealth, role playing elements, there are TONS of ways to complete missions, plot twists, A LOT of alternate story lines, a lot of fun augmentations, basically you haven't played a good RPG until you've played this, it's actually better than the Elder Scrolls in my opinion. I'd give it a 10/10 and I'll conclude this recommendation on a short tutorial on how to configure this game to run properly on modern systems with Windows 7 or later.

I'd reccomend this to everyone, no matter what kind of games you like since there are several ways to play it. I'd advice you to adjust the hotkeys before you play, makes the game much more enjoyable.			"

												Deux Ex, This is one of the best games I have ever played. A Seemless blend of FPS and RPG elements. The game has a fantastic story line that keeps you guessing. Each mission has a different way for you to complete it, which gives it a high replay value. With Nano Augmentations, Large Variety of weaponry and fairly complex puzzles the game has much to offer. I recommend this game to young and old gamers alike, this is one game you cannot pass up no matter the age.Final Score: 92/100			"

Heck buy the whole Deus Ex Collection.I also like how that one male death scream is universal. You will do it upon dying, your enemies will do it upon dying, civs caught in the crossfire do it, even the bosses do it! EVERY!SINGLE!TIME!It's one of the best things bout this game.

												A really entertaining game.With many possibilities to achieve any objective given to you, to the point that you might still find new ways to play through it after a couple of runs.An engaging story that becomes stronger as you get to know other perspectives, with tons of little details thrown around the world as newspapers, conversations, and e-mails.Clever level design and mechanics that let you choose whichever kind of gameplay you want to go for. Like taking a tactical approach, going like a spy hacking around security and stunning your enemies, or going full commando.And you're not forced into a linear way to complete each level. Most of the time, you're free to complete your objectives in whichever order you want. And once you clear a ""stage"", you keep all of your current items and money for the next one, making the transition between maps very natural.If you can get past the old graphics, you'll find a masterpiece.The only con I can think of is that you might need to download some mods to make it playable in new computers, because it will look DARK in its unaltered state.

												Althought Deus Ex broke ground in its day and is frequently listed on ""top 100"" lists as one of the most influential video games, I find it difficult to recommend today.The freedom to solve puzzles in the manner of your choice is appealing, and rarely has it been implemented so well. Deus Ex is hard, and that's good; it forces you to plan ahead.But the interface is really difficult to use, and the AI is so inconsistent that it breaks game immersion. These were problems when the game was new.Today, the original Deus Ex offers a walk down memory lane for people who played it when it was originally released But for younger gamers who are searching for some PC game history, it's confounding. I would recommend instead another groundbreaking game from the same era and same studio: Thief 1 and 2, which have aged much better.I give a cautious recommendation for Deus Ex, but only for people seeking historical perspective.

												We all know the cliche's: cyberpunk, dystopian future, with a morally grey protagonist who ends up entangled in something far bigger than himself. Hell, what am I talking about? We LOVE these damn cliche's!Deus Ex manages to deliver everything we love about the ol' William Gibson novels (which are turning out to be rather prophetic these days), while offering a pretty wide variety of CHOICE. What sorts of choices? From augments to multiple ways of handling situations. Wanna run-n-gun it? Do you. Wanna go Solid Snakin' it? Slither, homey. Wanna be diplomatic? Everyone needs friends. Just be sure to equip the augments that play nice with said play style.Graphically, Deus Ex uses the ol' Unreal Engine. So don't expect face melting graphics. However, for retro gamers like myself, these ""old"" graphics lend to the atmosphere in Deus EX: a time when cyberpunk was more escapist and less like what we all now live.In terms of difficulty, Deus Ex can be punishing. Particularly if you choose augments that don't work well with your tactics. At its time of release, this mechanic was still very experimental in gaming. Deus Ex definitely plays best on a second or third (or fourth or fifth) play-through.			"

												It's always a case of ""should I, should I not"". People talk about reinstalling this game every time they hear it, but do they actually play it? To innovate is good, but to stand and innovate is better, and Deus Ex innovates upon some previously laid down foundations from the System Shock series, but does not stand.It's your choice- it might have been the game of the year for its time, but until then, find a way to demo this game before you truly commit. For some, its clunky mechanics may not be worth it.			"

												For the longest time of owning this game on Steam (When I have literally owned a disc version since it came out over a decade ago), I have been trying to work up the courage to write a review on this game. I don't feel worthy, plainly put. This game is my all-time favorite game. It has everything; from game-changing augmentations to a branched storyline that changes as you make altering decisions. I just recorded a walkthrough of this game and posted it to YouTube, and it was such a fun ride! The nostalgia was so pleasing. I have beaten this game countless times. Really, I don't even want to try to count. I LOVE this game, GET this game, you WON'T regret it!!!P.S. About the multiplayer game not working, the original master server was shut down.

												I played Human Revolution so many years after the first Deus Ex that it wasn't clear to me why I had such a better experience with this game than with the newer one. To find out, I tried replaying this, but it was just too old-looking, too ugly, too clunky for me to bother. Enter Revision, aimed at exactly what I wanted to do: replay the first game, in such a state that I might be able to actually enjoy it.The mod pushes the original game's engine to its limits and beyond. But even with that in mind, don't go in thinking Revision will look like a game from 2010. It's more like what we remember games from 2002 to look like, and this game, unmodded, looks like what we think we remember games from 1991 to look like. But suffice to say, although it does look old, it is a smooth and enjoyable experience. You're not playing Revision in order to get wowed by next-gen graphics, you're doing it in order to enjoy the original Deus Ex using a modern computer. And the mod delivers a really great experience, preserving the important elements from the original year 2000 edition, and upgrading what needed it. Awesome. This game gets a 10/10. And I don't hand out 10s easily, at all. But it deserved it back in 2000 when it was released, and still deserves it today, given that Human Revolution was no match for it.Now back to the comparison between the original (well, the Revision Mod, but it's the original anyway) and Human Revolution: this is better than HR, and here's why. Over the course of the first mission in this game, my guy had obtained: a pistol, an electric prod, a mini crossbow, all of which are given to you at the start, depending how you choose what they give you, as well as, 4 gas grenades, a sniper rifle, a flamethrower, a crowbar, a combat knife, a baton, 3, yes, THREE weapon upgrades: a laser, a scope, and a mag expansion, and then the non-weapons: 2 sets of night vision goggles, a hazmat suit, a rebreather, and I might forget a toy or 3. Oh, and an augment to add to your character.Compare that to the MISERY that the 2011 game imposes upon you, where you have practically nothing (I forget the details) and weapons and upgrades are hard to come by, not mentioning that you have NO ROOM in your inventory to carry anything extra.BUT THAT'S NOT ALLThe first Deus Ex allows you to use your augments a LOT during the game. As such, you eventually turn into a kind of super-human being of disproportionate abilties, only the missions get progressively more impossible, REQUIRING you to use your augments and numerous toys in order to accomplish them. The 2011 game gimps you. The energy bars are SO RARE that you rarely get to use your superpowers. So between the lack of invetory space, toys, and energy bars, the 2011 Deux Ex: Human Revolution is far from as enjoyable as this game, which lets you do so much more.My hope is that Mankind Divided brings us back to this formula. I don't mind having to expand the carrying capacity, but I mind being so gimped that I can only carry a pistol and a tranq gun, and then 2-3 knick-knacks, for the first 5 hours. I don't mind upgrading my energy cells and recharge capacity, but I mind not being able to use my augs because there are 2 energy bars per level, allowing me 20 seconds of augmented abilities per 3 hours of play.I understand those things make it EASY to ""balance"" the game difficulty, but I also know it makes the game a hell of a lot less fun to play. We want toys and we want to be able to use them!!!This game? AWESOME. The Revision mod? AWESOME. It lets you see all that there is to hope for in Mankind Divided, and it's a heck of a good time.			"

												After almost 5 months of crawling through dark sewers, rummaging through the pockets of dead men, not cleaning my house and being late for work on several occasions, I completed the epic adventure and moral journey that is... Deus Ex. Even though it was released way back in 2000, and had never been considered pretty, I'd found that most well honed gamers still revered Deus Ex as a quintessential, almost religious-like, gaming experience... something I'd never experienced before (in anything.)So, sometime around the beginning of the year, I crawled into the skin of one J.C.Denton, spy guy.Deus Ex wasn't a difficult game for me (especially set on 'easy'), but it was challenging.  To spill blood or not to spill blood? (I'm a natural born spiller.) Should I  help the crazy lady find her cat? (I didn't.) Am I to go east or west? (I usually just turned left.) Will these decisions make a difference, somehow? *shrug*Deus Ex  was a game of Nerves and Patience and Decisions... and bullets.But, especially, Decisions.. which, by game's end, had become pretty monumental. Yeah, I really can't say that I had heaps-o'-fun playing Deus Ex. Sometimes it felt long and grueling. Or dark and oppressing.But, then, that's how it is, when something is intelligent and thought provoking.  And that's why I kept playing, because.. well, it was the object of the game.  I felt that, if I could make it to the end, I might, somehow, come out better than when I started.And, I think I did.			"

												Deus Ex is one of the best accidents I have ever tripped over.  I received this title as software bundle when I bought a video card, back in my early days of building rigs.  I had no idea what it was, but my roommate at the time said he had heard good things.  Boy was I in for a treat.Deus Ex is (yep, still is) the pinnacle of you picking whatever way you want to achieve your objective.  On top of that, you get conflicting objectives, forcing you to choose your path; thus shaping the game into one of three outcomes.  Sometimes it’s easy to get lost exploring the alternate routes you didn’t take on the way to an objective; it’s that engrossing.You are given a wide variety of skills, powers (cybernetic augmentations), tools, and weapons to go about your business; more choices to shape your gameplay.  As you play through you’ll get “skill points” (just another unit of RPG exp), and pick up “augmentation canisters” to establish your superhuman abilities.  You can even get upgrade modules for the weapons (silencers, lasers, etc.).To tie it altogether is a polished cyberpunk atmosphere with a well-written narrative.  The graphics limitations of the time are compensated for by legit voice acting, and AI behavior that’s impressive for the time it was released.A testament to this title is how the fan community has produced patches to maximize its performance on modern systems.  It makes playing it all over again that much more fun…over a decade later.  It is far better than its sequel (garbage), and still better than its flashy (but still good) prequel.Now, for the paltry price offered, why on earth would you not pick this up? "

Product received for free
A role-playing sci-fi game with loads of features, a very interesting story, great music, and iconically bad voice acting.I couldn't get into it the first few times I played it and I disliked it from the first few hours of gameplay but after a few recent restarts I learned to appreciate it. There are loads of gameplay features but much of them are pretty broken if not outdated, which was initially one of the main reasons I disliked the game at first.There are a multitude of skills you can upgrade that are given to you right from the beginning: Lockpicking, Electronics, Medicine, Computer, and Swimming. The Weapon Skills in the same window are Heavy, Pistol, Rifle, Low-Tech, and Demolition. If you don't know what weapon you just got benefits from what skill, you can check the info on its description.I realized that the skills aren't actually mandatory for the game's progression and I'm pretty sure you don't even need to upgrade any to beat the game; they're there to make certain play-styles easier on the player so should you obtain enough points to upgrade. For example, Lockpicking just decreases the amount of lockpicks you use for a heavily-locked door, Computer allows you to hack computers if you don't feel like or just haven't found the login/password for a terminal, and all the Weapon Skills increase damage & accuracy. As a good role-playing game goes, you can't legitimately max out everything in one playthough, at least not as far as I know anyway.Fancier upgrades can be found in the game via augmentation canisters that are located throughout the game with various functionalities that all eat up your energy meter when used. You're not a shake flashlight so you have to recharge your energy meter when appropriate via these recharging robots or a certain recharge item you can find throughout the game.Augs consist of things like the ability to lift heavier objects, run faster, EMP shield, and more. Each canister gives you a choice of what two augs you want to install to its desired slot. Unfortunately you can't replace already installed augs so you need to choose wisely on what you want to have. You can  quicksave/quickload to see how one augmentation works if you must. There are also upgrade canisters you can find that upgrade said installed augs for improved functionality.During my mostly-stealthy, mostly-non-lethal playthrough I found only a select few augs to be of any use and some I regret installing.Taking damage is pretty unique in this game as each limb has their own HP.If your legs' HP reach 0 you'll have to crawl instead of walk. If your arms', then your efficiency with weapons is decreased. If the head's or torso's reach 0, then you die. With medkits you can heal each limb individually. Miraculously you can practically regrow your limbs via food & drinks though you'd have to consume a hefty ton of those for that idea to come to fruition.Much of the game has you doing things manually with one of these things being the inventory. There's no inventory-tetris in the game despite several items taking up more than one space which can be a real pain sometimes. You can't rotate items so if something takes up 2 squares of inventory space horizontally then you'll have to make 2 empty horizontal slots yourself since there's no auto-arrangement when it comes to inventory space. It's a bigger nuisance if you're trying to pick an item up but you don't know how much space it needs so your only choice is to ignore the item altogether or drop several items on the ground hoping you've made enough room to even pick it up.One of the selling points of the game is how there really are multiple solutions to problems as advertised.Door's locked? You can lockpick it. No lockpicks? You can shoot it, hit it with a melee weapon, or use explosives depending on whether or not the door's weak enough. Is the door immortal? Either find a key or find an alternate path. The game's designed for each level to have at least more than one way to get through something save for one part of the game. You're even rewarded with supplies and usually skill points for exploring nooks and crannies.And of course you can go about the entire game using non-lethal measures.The gunplay is a little unreliable until you upgrade the appropriate weapon skill and/or you upgrade the weapon of choice with upgrade mods that you can find throughout the game. It's even more unreliable to go guns blazing in the beginning as well. Your crosshair is spread wide open until you stand still for a bit but even then the bullet can look like it just went outside of the crosshair diameter. For some reason the crosshair thing applies even to melee weapons, even if it's not visibly shown. I'm not entirely sure how the gunplay is played out if I upgraded their appropriate weapon skills since stealth was so strongly encouraged and that's how I often like to play games like this.The AI awareness when you're sneaking about is weird. They're certainly ""functional"" but how they work can easily shatter one's suspension of disbelief; they don't often hear gunshots when it looks like they should, sneaking up to them & colliding with their models doesn't alert them, and etc. etc. For some reason, to do a 1-hit takedown, lethal or non-lethal, on most humanoid enemies you have to hit them on their lower back for it to work. Hitting the head steathily just treats it as regular damage. You also have to collide with their bodies as you swing your weapon an inch above the belt region, otherwise it's just relied on RNG on whether or not you hit the desired spot.The tranquilizer darts are said to be ""quiet"" but it's hardly so when it doesn't instantly take them down and the enemy just runs in circles until they finally go down. Only if they're alone (as well as not being near an alarm button) will it be considered ""quiet"" as no one will be alerted while they run around until they drop. Even if an alarm is tripped in any manner it's easy to just hide and wait until the alarm silences and then everyone just goes about their usual stuff.You can loot a body, whether unconscious or dead, and can only pick them up when their inventory is empty. But there's no point in picking bodies up aside for comedic purposes since no one cares if there's a new body on the floor; all anyone cares about is if they ""witness"" the attack itself.The story is very interesting to say the least even if they are often portrayed through silly voice acting. Depending on what you do throughout the game, certain dialogue pieces change, characters die, characters appear at a different time, and so on. Sadly the story as a whole doesn't change no matter what you do aside from the endings.I found several bugs & glitches throughout the game. One that can potentinally ruin someone's playthrough are possible CTD's during critical parts of the game, though I've only come across that once. Basically, each time I loaded up this particular save file the game would crash immediately after the helicopter I saw left the area so I had no choice but to load up the next recent save file.Despite the FPS-looking nature of the game it's overall a role-playing game, though it looks like you can treat it like an action game if you so desire.I played the game without mods and it's been overall fine if you can deal with the bugs & small text.You'd also have to look past the outdated/broken graphics & certain functionalities of some gameplay mechanics and shoddy voice acting but if you can get by those then there's a better chance that you can see the game's probably not just something people put on nostalgia-glasses for to praise it.

												Absolute brilliance,  way ahead of its time, lots of RPG elements  a very good story some nice tunes and a very well thought level design. Don't forget to use the new vision texture pack from moddb.com and  the  DX10 renderer ( google it ). Graphics have  aged terribly  but with a little bit of  tweaking and modding  they should look  acceptable to  every1 except those  brainwashed graphic ♥♥♥♥♥s  who have finished  crysis  20 times in a row.   The model animation and the AI  isn't that good, even half-life back in  98  scored better in those areas, but its dynamic gameplay still can't be matched ,  why  don't they make  games like this  anymore ? :(			"

												This game is considered a classic.  And it's not hard to see why.  Though it was not the first game to try to combine first person shooters with an RPG style of game, it blended the genres together very well.  There are multiple paths to approach each problem, and sometimes your choices have an effect on the game.The game is not without flaws.  There are some very over-powered items in the game that can let you get through it without spending any points in your combat skills.  For all the branching paths the individual levels of the story may take, you're still ultimately shunted down the same end goal.  The AI is not particularly observant at times, and even coming across bodies of other dead guards they will not react (made even more noticable in that you can pick up and movie bodies, but there's no reason to.)Despite these flaws, the story is entertaining, the combat fairly effective and there's frequently ways to avoid it altogether if that's your thing.  Blending RPG elements into FPS games is commonplace now, but this was the game that truly cemented that revolution (along with other classics like System Shock 2).			"

												A game that holds up well over time - Deus Ex is a first person RPG/action hybrid that tells an engaging story about conspiracy and world domination in the future. For its age, the voices, music, and environments are quite good. All of the levels are thoughtfully designed, with freedom to allow the player to consider multiple ways to complete them, and it provides direction without the hand-holding found in some more modern games.Its only major flaw is graphics, which weren't particularly impressive even when the game was new. There are user-created mods that can significantly improve this, but it is still within the limitations of the engine. If you are able to ignore the outdated graphics, this game will leave a lasting positive impression on you.Also on Steam is the Deus Ex: Revision mod, which adds and alters many of the existing areas and is fun to play if you've already experienced the original.

												It's still the best game of all time. Seriously (not seriously. But... seriously)The graphics and voicework that were roundly mocked even when the game first came out now have a sort of retro charm to them.You'll need to lightly mod the game to get some things to work properly (thankfully, there's a surplus of guides on steam for doing just that)The game came from an era where forcing people to complete a separate tutorial just to grasp how the mechanics worked was totally expected.Yet, when you get through all that - it's still nearly impossible to find a game with the same scope of ambition. With so many intersecting playstyles and mechanics. With so much content that any one playthrough is likely to miss a fair bit. With an adult storyline that deals with important political issues in a realistic (and far-seeing) manner without ever preaching at you.It's amazing. If you haven't played it before... you really should.			"

												Despite some clunky mechanics, Deus Ex is definitely a great game, I can see why it is one of the, if not the highest rated game of all time. Great nonlinear leveldesign lets you find your own solutions to problems that can be tackled in multiple different ways. Music by none other than the composer who already made Unreal a feast for the ears.But rather than go over the good things that already have been stated a thousand times and list them a 1001th time, I find it appropriate to inform about some drawbacks you won't see mentioned nearly as often:Deus Ex is quite a challenge to run on modern PCs, and this is coming from an old Unreal Tournament veteran who knows how to edit every setting of every config file in his sleep.You'll have to spend some time fixing the game before you can even start playing. It suffers from a number of issues, like uncapped framerate which leads to it running too fast, prematurely cancelling ingame cutscenes/dialogue, screen tearing, crackling sound/music and mouse/cursor issues.There are a number of fixes available for some of those problems, some of which work better than others. The best renderer is a newer, fan-made OpenGL renderer, which you'll find on the net and requires the 1112fm update, also available on the net. This OpenGL renderer makes the game look just like it did back then, and has some important features like a framerate cap. I've also tried the often recommended DX10 renderer, and found that it makes rather drastic changes to the way lightning is handled in the game, usually for the worse, so I cannot recommend it.There's a 3rd party launcher for Deus Ex that apparently fixes many issues, but I don't like running additional software so I did most other fixes by manually editing the .ini files. Unfortunately, I have not found a solution for the mouse behaviour, particularly because it's the cursor in the menus rather than the ingame sensitivity that is way too high, with no way to change it. This makes going through the inventory, the logs and everything else you do in the UI a downright painful experience. And you will spend a significant amount of time dealing with the interface.Going through all that trouble is worth is though. When you're done pulling your hair out trying to get Deus Ex to run properly and scavenging the internet for various fixes, you're left with a great game that has a decent amount of replay value.

												Deus Ex is one of the best accidents I have ever tripped over.  I received this title as software bundle when I bought a video card, back in my early days of building rigs.  I had no idea what it was, but my roommate at the time said he had heard good things.  Boy was I in for a treat.Deus Ex is (yep, still is) the pinnacle of you picking whatever way you want to achieve your objective.  On top of that, you get conflicting objectives, forcing you to choose your path; thus shaping the game into one of three outcomes.  Sometimes it’s easy to get lost exploring the alternate routes you didn’t take on the way to an objective; it’s that engrossing.You are given a wide variety of skills, powers (cybernetic augmentations), tools, and weapons to go about your business; more choices to shape your gameplay.  As you play through you’ll get “skill points” (just another unit of RPG exp), and pick up “augmentation canisters” to establish your superhuman abilities.  You can even get upgrade modules for the weapons (silencers, lasers, etc.).To tie it altogether is a polished cyberpunk atmosphere with a well-written narrative.  The graphics limitations of the time are compensated for by legit voice acting, and AI behavior that’s impressive for the time it was released.A testament to this title is how the fan community has produced patches to maximize its performance on modern systems.  It makes playing it all over again that much more fun…over a decade later.  It is far better than its sequel (garbage), and still better than its flashy (but still good) prequel.Now, for the paltry price offered, why on earth would you not pick this up? "

												I played this game as a ten year old in 2004, when it was comparatively new, after someone installed it on one of our school computers. I bought it during a summer sale nearly a decade later and got really, really into it. All the characters look the same, aiming is a pain, it -never- autosaves and the stealth elements are clumsy at best. This game should be horrible – but somehow, it isn’t.In fact, Deus Ex is one of, if not the, best game(s) that I’ve ever played. If you like games with a strong sense of setting, it’s a must-play. The dark, filthy cities and the gritty techno music give you the feeling of a world that doesn’t have much time left. The developers also did a superb job at creating a world that feels fun to explore – there are plenty of (actually interesting) secrets to find, and many opportunities for sequence breaking.The dialogue is sharp, analytical and often thought-provoking, characters get philosophical at the drop of a hat and the plot manages to tie most famous conspiracy theories from the last century or so together without falling apart. J.C. himself is also really suave and charismatic despite looking at least twenty years older than his given age, kind of like a mix of Dirty Harry, Rick Deckard and Neo. All in all it's a very satisfying experience. They simply don’t make them like this anymore.P.S.: The Shifter mod improves some of the game's minor flaws and also adds secret weapons.			"

												This game is quite well-made, especially the story. I recommend it to anyone who likes their cyberpunk mixed with action, but anyone can play this game, with a few edits to the controls on the keyboard, plus the New Vision graphical enhancement mod. Word of warning; Your choices actually matter in this game. Just a heads up.			"

												One of the best games ever made. A compelling cyberpuck storyline with incredible detail, RPG character development, FPS gameplay, large open areas with multiple approaches to every problem, and incredibly dated graphics...Look past the graphics (and mod the game so that it loks as good as it can), and you are in for a special experience.

But for those who want a thinking man's FPS, this is it. Great characters, great environment, and great plot. Be sure to also download a few select Deus Ex mods for the best experience, such as New Vision, Shifter, Project HDTP, Deus Ex Enhanced, & Kentie's Deus Exe. Seriously, just play this game.

												Deus Ex is both a symbol of beauty and of great sadness.  It's full of choices and branching gameplay that is rarely seen in any other game, and few games have even come close to meeting what Deus Ex did a decade ago.  It may change the way you look at games for the better.One last thing, the first level at the Statue of Liberty is extremely scrappy and not indicitive of the rest of the game.

Great story, characters and dialogue. Every location is filled with secrets, diffent paths to complete your objective and lots of stuff to find. It takes around 30+ hours to complete if you try and do everything you can in each location. You can gun your way through the game killing everybody or you can be the silent type knocking enemies out. I'd highly recommend this game to anybody, it's amazing.			"

												If you can get past the bad graphics and clunky combat you will find one of the most unique and enjoyable gameplay experiences. I played this game in 2015 and still found it to be extremely compelling. The level design is excellent. There is true freedom of choice that effects the story. Side characters and side missions are extremely enjoyable. The design of this game is nothing short of incredible. The story is very enjoyable and even though the game is so old i found my self on the edge of my seat to see what the next twist is. The world is so immersive and well developed and I really feel you would be doing yourslef a disservice by passing this one up. The game is also pretty cheep for the amount of content. Doing only one story route the game is going to last around 20 hours and this game is not very expensive. There is also a mod that improves some of graphic assets if the bad graphics really bother you. Finally not to be forgotten this game has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard period. The soundtrack is really amazing and even if you do not play the game go listen to it on youtube it's awesome. Seriouls this game is a classic and should be played by all fans of rpgs and shooters.

												You see this cardboard man who looks like he replaced his scalp with a freezer unit and his eyes with lazer pointers? You hear his incredibly inaccurate thick German accent as he complains about a conspiracy by the custodial staff to replace all the soda in the vending machines with Orange flavor instead of Lemon-Lime?Well you see, he actually thematically represents the possible future plight of being left behind by the world due to physical augmentations becoming rapidly obsolete as new technology replaces it, and you not being upgraded due to the cost and lack of empathy from your superiors. This shatters your self-confidence and renders you irrelevant within society, furthering your frustration and anger that culminates in a hatred for the protagonist whose augmentations far surpass your own. This hate is unleased in the brutal execution of your employer's enemies and finally comes to a head once your unfeeling superiors send you to kill the rogue agent protagonist, fighting more for your own vitriolic feelings rather than for the puppetmasters that care not if you are melted down for scrap like a broken, inoperable machine.So that's something			"

												This is by far one of the best games I have ever played. Not only did the games scenes and backgrounds look great, but the dialogue is incredible. The whole design together really gives the feel of a dystopian future of the USA and the whole world where politics, businesses, and corporations rule all.The story is definitely the strong point. You play as JC Denton, a nano augmented agent of UNATCO, formed to fight terrorists after the bombing of the Statue of Liberty. You uncover conspiracy theories and many other ideals from all over the world and travel to uncover the truth. While I played I actually really felt the story coming to life and wondered if this was the same way our world was headed.If you enjoy shooters while getting an RPG elemnt, I highly recommend this. Its a beautiful gem from the minds of Warren Spector and Ion Storm.			"

												""Why contain it?'s cool.""-- VoltaireOne might argue what really makes a great game. Game mechanics, plot, characters, visuals, level designs, good marketing move to release at certain time or other nerd stuff. So why's everyone keep telling that a game with broken mechanics, outdated graphics, nonexistent ai and muhconspiracyfoilhats plot is one the best games ever made?It's always delivery. Deus Ex setups setting and drag you in from the first minutes, every time you play you will find something new: new newspaper article you didn't read, new way into some important building,  another chat from hobos about area 51 and stuff like this. Every level in this game is made for exploring. First time i played (2012, so no nostalgia tripping here) i didn't even know there's sidequests in this game. ""Kill a prisoner against my orders!""-- Joseph StalinWide variety of weapons with most of them being useless until you max out weapon mastery like it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Morrowind, one-shotting soldiers and randomly running enemies probably make it a bad FPS. But every time you find new weapon mod in some dumpster you're overjoyed like a boy who sees♥♥♥♥♥♥for the first time. Halfway in the game you're just noscoping with sniper rifle and stabbing people with jedi nano-sword and you're unable to notice any flaw, since plot has no brakes whatsoever and you jump around the globe engaging in terrorism and other pleasant activities.""I am the bartender... I am your man.""--BartenderBunch of ABSOLUTELY useless skills and augs that are in no circumstances would help you WHATSOEVER, non-existent economy and dialogue decisions once in forever would probably make it a bad RPG. However, with a way that characters react to your decisions and even playstyle,JC's killer quotes and a lot of really interesting stuff you will argue with absolutely random people (this barmen in triad club talking about how chinese dictatorship is far superior to corrupted Burgerland capitalism. I don't even want to mention this cool AI dude in some room in Illuminati hideout) along with sometimes pretty non-linear ways to handle stuff (Only time when game-designers will not let you do whatever you want and force you to bend to the plot by throwing at you invincible enemy and a bunch of invisible walls can be noticed only by true MLG autists like me) will make you forget this too. Not to mention that main character is collest and dangerousestest ♥♥♥♥♥ in da hood (major fault of deus ex 2 was a bunch of tumblr-like characters, even JC will talk some boring quotes of old farts like nobody's business).""I think the black people didn't show up for work at all...suspicous...""-- George WashingtonAnd atmosphere! It really feels like you're secret agent on the run in decaying near future society: uncovering conspiracies, killing corrupt officials, engaging in corporate espionage, lethally throwing soy food at soldiers, blocking enemies with cardboard boxes, using explosives to climb walls and healing yourself by jerking off a water cooler for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minute. While majority of good old games is rendered barely playable by time because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ interface, already fixed in remakes/sequels ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanics, applied wizard science to launch them or what not, deus ex instead of being a barely moving old fart is a motherflipping MC Vspyshkin: game is unarguably pretty old, but is still fun and kicking butt. Once you played it one time you will reinstall every time you hear The Synapse on the internet.And with all this replay value, there's also mods and multiplayer.Considering all that, i can only give this game 100 rusty skull-guns out of 100 and encourage you to play it as fast as possible in case you haven't.""my 3 daughters turned up dead, heres your op bonus 1000 credits"" -- Manderley			"

YouTube™ Video: Deus Ex: Does It Still Hold Up? 

			Views: 403		

			We take a look at the original Deus Ex to see if it still holds up today. Check out DAKNAP's video here: http://bit.ly/1peQM4g		

After almost 15 years, the legacy of this game still live strong, there are many games that follow the step of the original Deus Ex like a whole feature, games like Bioshock, S.T.A.L.K.E.R, Dishonored and also the new sequels Human Revolution and Mankind Divided, but...Does this game still hold up? Getting over the ugly graphics by today standards, bad voice acting, not so good stealth, RPG and Shooting gameplay, this one still a badass game.Why?The level desing is so superb that even today I still find new ways to finish a level, it serve all the short coming that the mechanics have, is so open that you can roleplay in this game, is so complex that can feel like a good level from a 90´s FPS and you can beat those levels without killing anyone.The Story is complex and a fun ride, if you are a sucker for Cyberpunk fiction this is one of the best tales of the genre, it goes over the cheesy dialogue and the sometimes hilarious execution, to deliver a fun tale, fun in a Cyberpunk 2020 RPG Module.The Music and the art direction, make me forget about the ugly graphics, to the point that sometimes I get so inmerse that I can stop playin until I find a to rest (in game), the levels seems so livable (I don´t know if that a word) that I sometimes seem myself care about the nameless soldiers and goons, I feel bad for them. In the end, the awnser is yes, even in 2015 there are no game that match this one in my opinion, there are many that came close, but at this time, this one still the second coming of Christ. ALL HAIL J.C DENTON.			"

												What can I say about this game that thousands haven't already said? It's ahead of its time, hell, even today's time in some aspects. It is mind-blowingly open ended, every problem has at least four possible solutions. The game, however, is very dated in some parts, but it is very easily overlooked once you get into it. I am playing this game on a 2012 Toshiba laptop, which means that it'll pretty much run on anything. Again, buy this game, $7 is an insultingly low price for this masterpiece.			"

												In Deus Ex, you play as kleptomaniac supercop JC Denton, whose newest line of bodily augmentations allows him to be superhuman while suffering minimal disfigurement, with the unfortunate side effect of being unable to change his facial expression. In this deeply personal narrative, you will help JC Denton struggle to control his constant food binging as well as his chronic alcohol addiction. In the midst of his stuffed and drunken stupor, he must struggle to avoid crushing dearly beloved pet cats and dogs with his uncontrollably lethal feet, as well as fight a global conspiracy.A plague has beset the global population, and in a future in which Obamacare has never been repealed, health care in America is as terrible as it ever was. In New York, the native population of bums and hipsters struggle to get their treatment (hard to distinguish). Terrorists blow up the statue of liberty, and in a stunningly subtle act of symbolism, the UN sets up a global police agency right over the ruined remains of the symbol of freedom.  As a member of the global police force with the worst police brutality managment known to all mankind, you have been tasked with harassing tea partiers who mistakenly believe that the Constitution is a document which is still obeyed. As you responsibly taser/beat/shoot/blow up in mutual understanding with the community you protect and serve, you uncover a conspiracy to undermind the governments of the world.JC realizes that a global agency is behind the creation of the plague, in a conspiracy to  cull the population of South America  sow disorder in governments across the world so that they may take over. Not an organization to be outdone, they have shown an impressive resume in various feats such as spending billions in research to manufacture laser swords and bringing dinosaurs back to life. Never let it be said that capitalism is not a pragmatic and beneficial economic system.In a globe trotting chase for the ultimate 3D printer, JC and friends realize that the global organization has taken the internet hostage at Area 51 in cooperation with the ayy lmaos and Seth Rogen. JC goes to Area 51 to save his waifu from being compromised, but then he learns that the ayy lmaos are actually just monkeys, which is something no one really doubted about Seth Rogen.In this game where every choice matters, you must choose to save the internet or release the virgins from their prison.9.5/10 It's OK -IGN			"

												There is no designated order of things to do, whichever direction you take is always the right one! Game is built around exploration but the punishing combat mechanics will see you mashing that quicksave key or lose precious progress to a two second firefight that didn't go in your favor. (Bots that aren't using sniper rifles shouldn't be able to instant kill headshot you.) They coupled together a magnificent soundtrack with the most hilarious (so bad it's good) voice acting I've heard in quite awhile. Ye olde countable polygons and short drawdistances (complete with fog) reminiscent to the N64 and playstation radiate an unsettling vibe similar to the first couple Tomb Raider games. Despite an emphasis on multiple interlocking branching paths in each map, thirty hours is quite awhile for the mechanics to start feeling formulaic. It boils down to finding the keys/login information/rockets/lockpicks/hack tools you'll need to open the next door and then pulling up the item or information and punching it in. Augmentations should have been passive and not reliant on yet ANOTHER finite bar of constnatly depleting energy. If you're going to make your game dark as all hell (as opposed to orange) the flashlight shoudln't sap your energy leaving you potentially irrevocably blind. The cache of items you can hold is unforgivably small and the firearms are HORRENDOUSLY IMABLANCED. I put every upgrade onto the assault rifle and it still couldn't carry its own weight. You only need the pistol, crossbow, dragontooth, stun baton, and of course the gep gun. A masterpiece in it's own time. Also there's an irritating bug that crashes the game about two thirds of the way in on the frigate escape.			"

												This game is one of my all-time favorites.It's a mix between FPS, stealth and small RPG-elements in it. You can upgrade some skills and  also choose from different implants, which will help you see through walls, jump higher, be stronger etc.It is set in a dark, cyberpunk-themed world, where mechanical augmentations are quite common.I don't want to spoil to much of the story, just summarized shortly, as the story is one of it's big strenghts:You are working as Agent JC Denton for UNATCO, an anti-terror force, which is operating worldwide, especially against the NSF, a terror group. At the beginning you are doing some missions against the NSF, which has stolen a  vaccine against the so called ""grey death"", a virus which infects lots of people.As the story progresses, you are dragged deeper into the mysteries and conspiracies of this world. What is this Virus? Who is Majestic 12? What is Echelon?I highly recommend this game to all of you (if you don't mind a bit outdated graphics), it's worth every cent imho :)I still get goosebumps when listening to the intro-music in the menu!! ^^			"

Deus Ex is very clearly a game that was ahead of its time. Though the graphics and sound have not stood up well to the test of time, the gameplay alone can still hold its own against that of modern games. This is coming from someone that didn't play Deus Ex back in 2000 when it was released -- my first experience with it came a decade afterwards. Even with all of 2010's shiny, new games, the one thing I kept thinking about Deus Ex was, ""This plays like a game that was released today.""If you consider yourself a fan of all games (and can forgive the older ones for showing their age) then you owe it to yourself to play Deus Ex. It is an amazing game that completely deserves all of its praise, as well as the place of honor it holds in the annals of video game history.			"

												This game may be old but where it lacks in graphics it makes up for in gameplay and story. Few games have captured me so much that every single book and newspaper I see lying around I read. Either it contains information related to the plot or some halrious ancidote about nothing important. I found so far that everything is kept fresh and there is always motivation to move on to the next room and explore everything just to find the hidden box of ammo. The stealth requires patience but nothing is more satisfying the eliminating a whole wharehouse of guards one by one. Wish more games were made like this one.			"

												Deus Ex is one of those games that define what an RPG is; a game that allows you to build and progress your character throughout the game and make choices throughout the game's solid plot to build your own take on it. Throughout the game creative thinking is encouraged to reach some areas, surpass obstacles, or even defeat certain enemies. The stealth mechanics are crude, however, the enemies seemingly having tunnel vision alot of times making it easy to sneak past them, or peak around a corner at them, somehow without them seeing your head poke out from behind a wall. The difficulty can be pretty weak when it comes to the enemies, I recommend playing on Hard or Realistic for a decent challenge. For a game released in 2000 the graphics are pretty solid though by today's standards they're pretty primitive, but that doesn't matter, graphics mean nothing so long as you have fun. You have a couple of different skills for different methods for making your way past the game's enemies, security systems and some hazards, but skills only enhance your capabilities with the tools, weapons and items associated with them making them more efficient, but in some cases it is hardly needed, for instance, with Explosives you don't really need skill enhancement that much, explosive weapons already do enough damage to instantly kill the majority of enemies you encounter. (And in the case of grenades you can have plentiful amounts of them.) But skills definately help in getting a better aim faster with ranged weapons, and modding and enhancing said weapons is a nice touch when you can stick a ""silencer*"" on an Assault Rifle or a Sniper Rifle, turning a sniper into a quiet one-shot-kill weapon most of the time. (so long as you aim for the head) Ontop of that, slow reloads on your shotguns? There's a mod for that. Trouble with the gun's shots hitting your target? There's a mod (and skills) for that. Want to turn a pistol into a marksman weapon? There's a scope mod for that. Multiplayer I haven't played much of but I vaguely recall it being fun but also confusing, can't really comment on it, but I can certainly comment on the actual game itself: A classic that has stood the test of time.9/10*Unlike real life -suppressors- the silencer in the game actually makes weapons silent to enemies.

												Real conspiracies. Severe consequences. Intense action role-playing.Writing this takes me back to pre-Steam times. I played this game for the first time back in year 2001 and later on made either a partial or full replay every 3-4 years. Everytime I was overwhelmed and impressed with immerse story that takes you all around the world, all these well written characters, movie-like screenplay and captivating sound environment. I would spend many hours looking in every corner, putting the pieces back together and digging the story and it's background, discovering secret areas, thinking about philosophical questions hidden between the lines - pretty much embracing Deus Ex. (A huge portion of this was successfully recreated and implemented in Human Revolution - which I would like to recommend as well). Deus Ex is among my few best games I have ever played, literally a diamond of a game. Everything about this game is exceptional: moral choices and it's consequences, elastic gameplay, the atmosphere, all the ambiance you can experience. Everything, in a way modern games try to achieve with mixed success.Did I mention replay value? Tremendous. Someone mentioned Deus Ex and I reinstalled deciding to not to give up and push on till I see the credits! Game from year 2000 won with growing line of brand new titles. To my amazement I managed to discover three new hidden areas and finding them after several replays was really rewarding. Has it aged well? For 2000 game, hell yes, only of you can handle near millennial style of boxy graphics and somewhat wooden animations, but really it doesn't matter and shouldn't bother you since backbone and writing of this game is really solid and presents still open and actual questions like: global government, NWO, infiltration, genetic enchancement and augmentations knocking to our door. ""Trust no one. Question everything"" - Play Deus Ex and soak in and embrace the night.			"

												One of the best games you will ever play.  If you want a surprisingly believable story involving government and global conspiracies with a multitude of characters & a wide variety of skills to upgrade, buy this, you will not be let down.  The soundtrack  is phenomenal, the music matches exactly what the level and setting feels like.  There are lots of skills in which you can put skill points into to make yourself a deadlier close range fighter, a pinpoint sniper, a more proficient hacker, and more.  The augmentations are awesome, you can give yourself the ability to cloak, to see through walls, to run as quiet as amouse, and much more.  There's an abundance of weapons which you can upgrade to give it a laser, a scope, make it more accurate, and more.  There's really just more of everything.  You get to go to Hong Kong, Paris, and even Area 51, the places are very memorable, with the amazing soundtrack to accompany them.  One thing that people would argue as being a flaw of this game, is the voice acting, and while I do agree it's mediocre, it's that voice acting that gives the game even more charm to it.  Fighting with enemies isn't really that much fun though, it's a standard 'click until dead' combat system.  + Believable and gripping story with lots of twists+ Best video game soundtrack ever+ Many skills and augmentations+ Many weapons with modifications to boot+ Memorable levels and great level design+/- Mediocre voice acting- Battles could be done much betterWithout a doubt, the best single player game ever made.

												""Deus Ex is a game that brought Cyberpunk universe and the gameplay to the next level."" Ya surely saw this quote somewhere on the internet, but how can this old game made in 2000 is so damn important? Is it enjoyable? Does it hold up to today's standards? You shall see these answers in this review!The game takes place in 2052 where the world is plagued with the Gray Death and some people are desperate to recieve a vaccine called ""Ambrosia"" with any dangerous means. You play as JC Denton, the agent of UNATCO which protects people from terrorist organizations, until your brother left and joined the terrorists, while the organization you work on wants him dead without giving any information you want to know why. Why your brother did that? What is UNATCO hiding? I cannot spoil further. But I can guarantee that you will meet many conspiracies related to it.When it comes to the graphics, in 2000 it was really amazing what you could do with Unreal Engine 1. Today it is pretty much outdated but there are still some modifications that lets you play on higher quality graphics such as DirectX 10 Deus Ex with New Vision and HD models installed. If you are really bothered with normal graphics then get em, if not then enjoy how Unreal Engine 1 did in 90s if used correctly.The gameplay is outstanding. Despite it is a FPS game, it also has some RPG elements on it and no ya dn't level up. Instead you recieve Skill points that you can spend to upgrade your skills. The Skill Points are recieved if you complete any main objectives along with side missions, yet there are also recieved as a bonus if you use a different route. Now we are talking about the 1st main thing...You have multiple choices in this game, if you want to concentrate more in getting past undetected, lockpick the lock, hack the terminal and use turrets to do your job? It is possible. Going gun-blazing and use any tricks you have at the disposal to deal with the enemies? CHECK. Also any action you take in a populated area may affect your progress as well!Now the 2nd main thing about this game are...augmentations. You can modify your body parts with the correct augmentation to gain more sweet stuff that can be used anywhere and change your gameplay style and upgrade them!. Be aware that there are limited slots for some body parts to modify. Wanna go invisible and jump really high and run fast at the same time like a ninja? YOU CAN. But be aware though that there is a limited energy for using augmentation so if you have multiple augs on, then deal with the fact that you may run out of them pretty fast.There is a lot of weapons in this game yet using them depends on your skill level and you can upgrade them with the correct kit for more interesting results, except these two some weapons can use different ammo which some enemies are weak against it. For example using the Sabot shells will allow you to deal more damage against robots than the Buckshot shells. Combining your weaponry with augs may give you great results like using Targeting aug at the level 2 with laser sight pistol lets you sniper your enemies without wasting any ammo for sniper rifle or use the Agressive Defense System with Balistic Protection augs and shotgun to become a tank which no missile or bombs won't hurt you.The music in the game fits perfectly for any situation and the world itself filled with cutting edge technology and the dialogues may be cheesy but funny while the weapons gives some oomph when you fire.If you consider getting this for a low price then DO IT! It is worth any money for not only how amazing this game is but as well as game mods that give even more dramatic changes in the gameplay to make it more fun such as The Nameless Mod and other.			"

												Deus Ex, despite being released in the summer of 2000, is still one of the greatest role-playing shooter hybrids available on PC. If you're a fan of futuristic settings or the cyberpunk science fiction genre as I am, Deus Ex's storyline and environments should be right up your alley.Set in 2052, you take on the role of JC Denton (JC supposedly refers to Jesus Christ) a rookie to an anti-terrorist organization called UNATCO. But things quickly get out of control and you are soon involved in a huge conspiracy involving various factions - including the Illuminati and the Hong Kong Triads, as you travel over the world to unravel this conspiracy.The game allows a great deal of freedom and various choices - you will also have a few multiple endings to achieve. Deus Ex is a branching game, meaning there are always multiple paths to choose from, you could even choose to not kill anyone at all through the entire game - which is a lot more complicated to do than it sounds, trust me!

												There's not much I can say in my review that hasn't been said in the other positive reviews on here. Deus Ex is a first person shooter/RPG hybrid, regarded by many as the best game ever made. Is it? In my opinion, no, but it is still a great game. If you've played System Shock or Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines, you should feel right at home here.Let's get a few of the 'bad' things out of the way first, the things I've seen a lot of people ♥♥♥♥♥ and moan about on here and on Metacritic. First off, yes the game is ugly. Look at the screenshots before you buy it. If you don't like how it looks, then don't buy it, simple. The graphics are bad, the character models are fairly wooden, and the voice acting is so bad it's good. Oh, and the default key bindings are pretty bad. But you know what? You can re-map the keys. So it's really a non-issue.Onto the good stuff. This game focuses a lot on inventory management. It's like an old RE title, or Diablo II, where you have only so much room in your inventory for items. So you'll constantly be wondering if it's worth it to carry around the huge flamethrower or keep a couple of pistols and a sword; personally I find this a great change in pace from some games that just let you carry around everything. The sheer level of character customization is crazy. You get skill points, but only at certain points; you gain nothing from defeating enemies, unlocking doors, etcetera. When you find a secret room or explore a certain area, you get skill points, and you get them from completing objectives. Then its up to you where to put them. Pistols, rifles, melee combat, explosives, pickings locks, swimming, healing, and more. You can't master them all (withoug exploting a bug late game) so you have to manage the skill points wisely. On top of that, you can find countless modifications for your guns, among them recoil, reload speed, range, scopes, and laser sights. Oh, and and on top of that, you have several slots for augmentations to your body to give you healing power, quicker speed, strength, defense, and more. But you only have so many slots, and the augmentation items you find carry two for one slot. So do you take health regeneration, or an energy shield? There are so many ways to customize the character to your playstyle it is really astounding.The levels themselves a huge and allow for a variety of routes. In the first mission, I was looking for the person I needed to speak to for my objective; he was to allow me to get into the building where my foes were. Instead I found a big stack of boxes and jumped up on them until I got to the roof, totally bypassing that part of the mission. Later on, if you're careful and look everywhere and make the right decisions, you can even find information to skip entire boss fights. The story can be a bit on the confusing side, but it's well written and takes into account a lot of different conspiracy theories from the real world. I can't say to much without spoiling it so I'll leave it to you to figure it out. So should you get this game? Yes, absolutely. For $6.99, it's practically stealing.			"

												If you are a fan of RPG, FPS, or stealth games you NEED to play this. Deus Ex is up there with Bethesda's games in terms of sheer freedom of play. Wanna be stealthy? Go for it. Wanna go balls to the wall guns blazing? No problemo. There's also hacking, lock picking, nano augmentation, hiding bodies, dialog options, multiple endings, you name it. This game was stupidly ahead of its time. Even the story is eerily conspiratorial and prophetic. A dystopian cyberpunk future where global governments use surveillance and engineered pandemics as population control. Did I mention the game predicted the destruction of the WTC at the hands of a terrorist organization? in the year 2000. Now with that being said, this is an old♥♥♥♥♥game with wonky shooting and dated graphics. Essential mods you will need to maximize your enjoyment of this undisputed classic include - BioMod, HDTP, and the New Vision Mod.			"

Deus Ex is a branching game, meaning there are always multiple paths to choose from, you could even choose to not kill anyone at all through the entire game - which is a lot more complicated to do than it sounds, trust me!

												One of my favorite games on my list, Deus ex is a game like no other. It introduces unique storyline and an rpg-esque  feeling to it. A great thing about this game is that you can choose how you want to play. Like for example, you can play the game non-letal or lethal. And your choices you make in the game will change how parts of the game happen or what will happen. Also you know its a good game if you want to replay right after beating it ;)			"

												This game is seriously the best game ever made.  It seamlessly merges a captivating story, comprehensive RPG elements, wonderful stealth mechanics, and exciting gun battles.  It's a game that focuses on environment rather than inexplicable yet convenient chest high walls all over the place to take cover behind.  The graphics aren't that great anymore, but if you are looking at a game released in the early 2000's for graphics you are being silly.  Regardless, there are mods you can use to improve them.  Deus Ex set the bar for all RPG FPS games since its release.  It is absolutely worth the cost.			"

												Deus Ex is personally my favorite game of all time, as even over a decade later, its story and gameplay hold up as some of the finest amoung all video games. The story is one of intrigue, as the main character JC Denton finds himself a pawn in the schemes of the numerous powers to control mankinds destiny and must unravel the conspiracies that truely move the world. With ideas of globalization, corporate power, and internet monitoring playing prominent roles, Deux Ex ends up even more relavant today with its almost prophetic themes. In terms of gameplay, while some aspects might feel slightly cluncky, it still allows for some of the most freedom in accomplishing objectives, from stealth, diplomacy, and long range gunning to barging in guns blazing and even running past bosses. In both these aspects of story and gameplay, Deus Ex is unmatched and is a required at least one playthrough from anyone.			"

Set in a bleak future where the populace clamors for the treatment to an artificial disease and the FEMA director vies for absolute power, it's up to agent J.C. Denton to restore order. With great writing, an immersive world, and a very tough decision to make at the end, ""Deus Ex"" and its threequel ""Human Revolution"" should be on everyone's shortlist of games to play, like, right now.

												They don't make games like this anymore. It is exceptionally well-written in every single detail. At first it's funny how it manages to incorporate all the popular conspiracy theories, and it becomes frightening when they all turn out to be true. The way people are kept in line with constant terror alert, the shoot-on-sight cops, and the artificial plague is a very dark vision of the future, but the events since the release of the game suggest that it may be prophetic.The role-playing elements, and the non-linear and fully interactive environment provide lots of freedom to the player: in every playthrough one can find new ways to complete an objective and discover new details hidden in unexpected places. It is advised to talk to every NPC for several rounds, because almost all of them have something interesting and potentially useful thing to say. Mirrors are rarely found in games for some reason, but, interestingly, in this one they are abundant (check yourself in a mirror to see how bad the character animation is). If you can ignore the outdated graphics and the weak voice acting, you get the best PC gaming experience ever created.The music is also noteworthy, Straylight Productions composed another perfect soundtrack after their previous work in Unreal. It's interesting to compare the cover image of this game and its sequels: this one shows the moment of enlightenment, while the others show aggressive thugs.If you liked the game, check out The Nameless Mod as well.

												There's not much I can say in my review that hasn't been said in the other positive reviews on here. Deus Ex is a first person shooter/RPG hybrid, regarded by many as the best game ever made. Is it? In my opinion, no, but it is still a great game. If you've played System Shock or Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines, you should feel right at home here.Let's get a few of the 'bad' things out of the way first, the things I've seen a lot of people ♥♥♥♥♥ and moan about on here and on Metacritic. First off, yes the game is ugly. Look at the screenshots before you buy it. If you don't like how it looks, then don't buy it, simple. The graphics are bad, the character models are fairly wooden, and the voice acting is so bad it's good. Oh, and the default key bindings are pretty bad. But you know what? You can re-map the keys. So it's really a non-issue.Onto the good stuff. This game focuses a lot on inventory management. It's like an old RE title, or Diablo II, where you have only so much room in your inventory for items. So you'll constantly be wondering if it's worth it to carry around the huge flamethrower or keep a couple of pistols and a sword; personally I find this a great change in pace from some games that just let you carry around everything. The sheer level of character customization is crazy. You get skill points, but only at certain points; you gain nothing from defeating enemies, unlocking doors, etcetera. When you find a secret room or explore a certain area, you get skill points, and you get them from completing objectives. Then its up to you where to put them. Pistols, rifles, melee combat, explosives, pickings locks, swimming, healing, and more. You can't master them all (withoug exploting a bug late game) so you have to manage the skill points wisely. On top of that, you can find countless modifications for your guns, among them recoil, reload speed, range, scopes, and laser sights. Oh, and and on top of that, you have several slots for augmentations to your body to give you healing power, quicker speed, strength, defense, and more. But you only have so many slots, and the augmentation items you find carry two for one slot. So do you take health regeneration, or an energy shield? There are so many ways to customize the character to your playstyle it is really astounding.The levels themselves a huge and allow for a variety of routes. In the first mission, I was looking for the person I needed to speak to for my objective; he was to allow me to get into the building where my foes were. Instead I found a big stack of boxes and jumped up on them until I got to the roof, totally bypassing that part of the mission. Later on, if you're careful and look everywhere and make the right decisions, you can even find information to skip entire boss fights. The story can be a bit on the confusing side, but it's well written and takes into account a lot of different conspiracy theories from the real world. I can't say to much without spoiling it so I'll leave it to you to figure it out. So should you get this game? Yes, absolutely. For $6.99, it's practically stealing.			"

												There's a lot that's been said about Warren Spector's brainchild, that over-achieving cousin of Daikatana. What I'll say is this: it's dated, a bit janky with some bad (if heartfelt) voice acting and graphics that aren't exactly eye-pleasing.Yet...the very fact that all of those things are seen as lovable quirks by its fans are a testament to everything else Deus Ex did right, all the way back in 2000.And, as it turns out, there is such a thing as a free (graphical) lunch. The Deus Ex: Revision mod is a total aesthetic overhaul of the original game (including music) made over a period of 7+ years by dedicated fans. It's almost comparable to Black Mesa, except the Revision crew largely left the gameplay alone. The purists in the fan community still don't like it, of course, but they're friggin' nerds anyway.Suffice to say even without Revision, Deus Ex is a timeless classic and formed one of the cornerstones of video gaming's adolescent period; not to mention it's just a good stealth FPS/RPG in general for its age. The gameplay by itself could be partially considered a product of its time - the combat while satisfying enough for me is clunky like Bethesda's Fallout model, some of the augmentations are mostly useless and the aug activation buttons take up your entire F-key row. The presence of lean keys and an interactive item toolbar are welcome, at least.If you're not familiar with FPSes and can't manage to get a grip on the (reconfigurable) controls, you will have a hard time more often than not. Actual progression takes long enough that many people who play and replay the game, even veterans, stop after the first couple levels; it doesn't help that some of the lategame levels can be a slog at times. It's comparable to Half-Life 2 in this regard.Those are, however, the only criticisms I can think of. While I'd say there's too much that's been stuffed in to really call it elegant, when the good stuff clicks? It's really good. There's enough meaningful choice and emergent gameplay here to surprise you even after you read this review. Deus Ex rewards exploration and forethought, and while I'm not some jaded, entitled complainer, I'd like to see more of that in today's games. It was certainly innovative back when it was released. If you find the game slow going, I would advise you to simply stick with it. The amount of player choice and customization even in the vanilla game is also noteworthy for a title this old.As for JC Denton and his quest? While it's kind of corny, convoluted and obviously influenced by 1990s conspiracy theory culture, it ultimately grabs you by the collar with its twists, intricacies & personality - and doesn't let you forget it. It's reactive enough to the player's actions that I'd say it's also comparable to Undertale.And the music. It isn't to be missed; rarely do game soundtracks achieve so much harmony with a game as in Deus Ex.Now, this was still back in the Bad Old Days of Pentiums you needed to upgrade every year and action heroes who could be described as Gruff Man or Big Boobs, so while Deus Ex probably isn't the 2000s equivalent of The Talos Principle, it's still definitely a cut above the rest of its time.There is...was...multiplayer as well, but not only did it use the now-defunct Gamespy service and is very likely dead, it seemed largely perfunctory. It's still nice to see Deus Ex-style gameplay in a multiplayer environment, but if you somehow get it working you'd need to bring friends along for that particular diversion.In conclusion, if you are interested in gaming history and/or action RPGs and have a tolerance for old games, play this. You won't regret it.A word of advice, however: visit this guide, scroll down to ""Installing Patches"" and install the two listed there. Launcher/graphics stuff is up to you, but at least patch the game up.			"

Mods and graphical patches have brought this title up to date and with AA/SGSSAA/FXAA/AF it looks fantastic using the new DX10 renderer. One of the longest and definitely one of the best first-person RPGs ever made. I've beat this game 5 or 6 times and each time I found things I'd never seen before. Remember: You can only get the intended and proper Deus Ex experience on Realistic difficulty.			"

												Despite the dated graphics and often poor VA, Deus Ex rules supreme for its combination of excellent storytelling and great (though at times borked) gameplay. Even now, years after its original release it remains a strong contender amongst modern titles; no mean feat for a game from 2000. So good I rebought it upon its steam release.We are the invisible hand. We are the Illuminati. We came before and after. We are forever. And eventually... eventually, we will lead them into the day.

												There's a lot that's been said about Warren Spector's brainchild, that over-achieving cousin of Daikatana. What I'll say is this: it's dated, a bit janky with some bad (if heartfelt) voice acting and graphics that aren't exactly eye-pleasing.Yet...the very fact that all of those things are seen as lovable quirks by its fans are a testament to everything else Deus Ex did right, all the way back in 2000.And, as it turns out, there is such a thing as a free (graphical) lunch. The Deus Ex: Revision mod is a total aesthetic overhaul of the original game (including music) made over a period of 7+ years by dedicated fans. It's almost comparable to Black Mesa, except the Revision crew largely left the gameplay alone. The purists in the fan community still don't like it, of course, but they're friggin' nerds anyway.Suffice to say even without Revision, Deus Ex is a timeless classic and formed one of the cornerstones of video gaming's adolescent period; not to mention it's just a good stealth FPS/RPG in general for its age. The gameplay by itself could be partially considered a product of its time - the combat while satisfying enough for me is clunky like Bethesda's Fallout model, some of the augmentations are mostly useless and the aug activation buttons take up your entire F-key row. The presence of lean keys and an interactive item toolbar are welcome, at least.If you're not familiar with FPSes and can't manage to get a grip on the (reconfigurable) controls, you will have a hard time more often than not. Actual progression takes long enough that many people who play and replay the game, even veterans, stop after the first couple levels; it doesn't help that some of the lategame levels can be a slog at times. It's comparable to Half-Life 2 in this regard.Those are, however, the only criticisms I can think of. While I'd say there's too much that's been stuffed in to really call it elegant, when the good stuff clicks? It's really good. There's enough meaningful choice and emergent gameplay here to surprise you even after you read this review. Deus Ex rewards exploration and forethought, and while I'm not some jaded, entitled complainer, I'd like to see more of that in today's games. It was certainly innovative back when it was released. If you find the game slow going, I would advise you to simply stick with it. The amount of player choice and customization even in the vanilla game is also noteworthy for a title this old.As for JC Denton and his quest? While it's kind of corny, convoluted and obviously influenced by 1990s conspiracy theory culture, it ultimately grabs you by the collar with its twists, intricacies & personality - and doesn't let you forget it. It's reactive enough to the player's actions that I'd say it's also comparable to Undertale.And the music. It isn't to be missed; rarely do game soundtracks achieve so much harmony with a game as in Deus Ex.Now, this was still back in the Bad Old Days of Pentiums you needed to upgrade every year and action heroes who could be described as Gruff Man or Big Boobs, so while Deus Ex probably isn't the 2000s equivalent of The Talos Principle, it's still definitely a cut above the rest of its time.There is...was...multiplayer as well, but not only did it use the now-defunct Gamespy service and is very likely dead, it seemed largely perfunctory. It's still nice to see Deus Ex-style gameplay in a multiplayer environment, but if you somehow get it working you'd need to bring friends along for that particular diversion.In conclusion, if you are interested in gaming history and/or action RPGs and have a tolerance for old games, play this. You won't regret it.A word of advice, however: visit this guide, scroll down to ""Installing Patches"" and install the two listed there. Launcher/graphics stuff is up to you, but at least patch the game up.			"

												This game may be old but where it lacks in graphics it makes up for in gameplay and story. Few games have captured me so much that every single book and newspaper I see lying around I read. Either it contains information related to the plot or some halrious ancidote about nothing important. I found so far that everything is kept fresh and there is always motivation to move on to the next room and explore everything just to find the hidden box of ammo. The stealth requires patience but nothing is more satisfying the eliminating a whole wharehouse of guards one by one. Wish more games were made like this one.			"

												Deus Ex is one of the most influential games ever made. No genre describes this game as it seamlessly blends action, stealth, RPG and story elements into one unique game. It's safe to say that this is the best game in the Deus Ex series, with Human Revolution taking second place in my opinion.Firstly, I will talk about the gameplay. The game has three difficulty settings, and I prefer to play on normal. It isn't ridiculously difficult, but first-time players will be challenged and may find the game rather punishing. You really have to explore every inch of the game because if you run out of lockpicks or multitools, things are going to take a turn for the worse. But I think that this encouragement to explore really enhances the experience. This game makes you think. You can't just run gung-ho into combat because you WILL die. Instead, it makes more sense to creep around in the shadows with a melee weapon or sniper rifle, picking off unaware foes and dragging their bodies into a dark corner where nobody can see them. However, the stealth is often very inconsistent. There was one time when I sniped off a guard from afar and his comrades didn't even notice, but there was another time when I did the same thing and everybody was immediately aware of my exact position. Thankfully, there's always another way around an objective, and this open-ended level design is a hallmark of this series. The game has RPG elements such as skills that let you specialise your character, and a wide range of augmentations that allow you to regenerate health, see through walls, go invisible and even detonate rockets as soon as an enemy fires them. These elements force you to choose a playstyle that suits you well, and caters to any player's needs. Want to go in charging like a living tank? The ballistic sub-dermal armour will let you take more damage without dying. Want to sneak in the shadows like a ghost? The cloak aug will stop enemies from seeing you. I found the most useful aug was regenerating health, because you will frequently take damage from hazards littered liberally around the environments. Choices matter a lot in this game. For example, if you tell Jaime Reyes to stay in UNATCO, he meets you later in Paris and gives you a killphrase that allows you to bypass the fight with Gunther Hermann. This brings me to my next point: this game has the BEST BOSS BATTLES OF ANY OTHER GAME EVER. You don't even have to do them. You can just run right past. You can even kill bosses in earlier levels so you won't have to do them later on. I wish other games used this mechanic!         Not everything is perfect, though. This game has plenty of issues. I have encountered many bugs, from getting stuck in doors, to characters transmitting me the same message ten times, to using my jumping aug to jump through the ceiling of the 'Ton hotel and then landing on an invisible floor 3 feet above the ground. But to be honest, this doesn't detract from the experience and in some cases even enhances it. I mean, it would be fairly logical for me to be able to get stuck inside a repair bot, wouldn't it?  Maybe not. In any case, this is a fun game to play.       Now I will talk about the presentation. This game is 17 years old, and graphically it really shows its age. Character models look blocky, textures look blurry, and the environments are so ridiculously dark that I couldn't see things a metre in front of me in some cases. But the game is still really immersive, and although some sci-fi elements are REALLY far-fetched, the game still feels real. The political themes of the game mirror real life and in some cases, the game even feels like a social commentary. This results in a game that is still immersive despite its laughable graphics, and is probably the number one example of ""graphics aren't everything"". "

												So, this game made in the year 2000? Well, it's hard to believe. Game is about future so does it's codes too. Too many details for an old game. For example, I went to women restroom and I got caught then she tell on the boss about me and he chew out. Whatever, game is really good for it's release date. You can upgrade your skills by completing missions, exploring areas or using speacial ways to accomplish missions. Also you have a technological body so you can add yourself some Augmentations and you can upgrade them by finding Augmentation Upgrade Canisters. You can hack computers, bypass the secure codes and lockpick the doors. These are too hard for you? Just poke around a little bit and you'll find the nano keys for doors, security codes and logins to computers. So this is what this game like. Just give it a try I'm sure you'll love it!			"

												Its storyline is gripping, the environment rich, a lot of people to talk to, many sidequests to solve.You can choose how to complete a level (melée, infiltration, sniping etc.) and combine all of those.The development of Your capabities is three-fold: You can level up Your skills, aquire augmentations (special powers) and get weapon modifications - some of these You can combine to some degree (e.g. You can get temporary weapon skill increase by using an aug instead of increasing the weapon skill), so combining them intelligently definitely will give You an edge on the field.The setting itself is futuristic cyberpunk world, full of conspiracies, where the protagonist have to try his best to staly alive and further the agenda of one group or another - because in Deus Ex Your choices have consequences, and these may not be readily apparent.A 1000 Kudos to the creators, May Your BioEnergy Never Deplete!

												I want to tell you a story. It has spoilers, so consider yourself warned.My JC Denton was a good agent. In the field, he was an intelligent, efficient snipe-happy hacker, with a pistol for emergencies. (Side note: Silenced sniper rifle + laser-sight pistol, both at Advanced skill level =OP.)However, when he infiltrated the building Paul Denton told him to to show him that UNATCO was corrupt, my JC mixed up his objectives and went to the roof, where the satellite dish he was supposed to change if Paul was correct was located, instead of the basement, where the proof was. This was a bit of a dilemma.Then my JC Denton had an epiphany.He realized that he would work for whichever side allowed him to shoot, loot, and hack as much as possible. So right then and there, my JC hacked the satellite dish and looted what was inside, betraying his country for some immediate cheap thrills. Don't get me wrong, he wasn't psychotic; my JC was just extremely vindictive, self-righteous, and challenge-seeking, and he had a lot of guns.He then went through the rest of the game, shooting and looting and hacking all over the place, and when the time came, he took the only sensible option and merged with Helios.Deus Ex has a lot of problems. It looks awful, there aren't enough character options for the action-oriented player, the voice acting is atrocious, and some enemies have way too much health (lookin' at you, greasels). However, any game with this amount of player choice and understanding of the player (one time, when lost and trying to leave a cathedral, I walked up to a French chef and JC promptly asked how the hell to get out of there) deserves whatever recommendations it can get.Seriously though, f*ck all the transgenics.

												Deus Ex is truly a masterpiece. Despite the name there is no Deus Ex Machina effect whatsoever - everything is logical and consequential and every detail is a piece of whole - user's password can tell you about his life more than you can hear from anyone, organisation name contains a key to it's entrance, and internet adresses hint major plot twist. The world of demolished Lady Liberty is surprisingly and eerily real both in it's behaviour and as a very possible future of ours. It also one of the most stylish worlds out there. Without overusing design cliches and descending into self repetition it keeps cold, metallic demanaur faintly lit by distant LED lights and blue ROM module colloids from the start to the end. And the wonderful tracker soundtrack by Alexander Brandon and Michel van de Bos is making perfect - transcendent.As for the gameplay. On the first glimpse arsenal is quite poor - less than ten types of firearms, couple of throwables, few melee choices and array of tools - but what this game about is you, as a player, as a character. Main tool in your arsenal is your head - numerous ways to approach the objective are only multiplied by your skills and the most useful tool in game - augmentations, which allow you to perform superhumane tasks such as invisibility, wind speed combined with impossible jump height or even projectile-stopping nanite shield - everything is in your hands. But beware that you are limited not only by supply of bioelectricity, but also with finite augmentation possibilities. The brighter you burn the faster you expire and one possibilities take take place of anothers. So at the end your head - is your main tool and weapon, not even the GEP gun.Don't be scared off by strange and old look of unreal engine or somewhat obsolete (i'd say more outmoded though) futurology - game holds it's mark to this day and is, and never cease to be a truly amazing and unique experience. Give it a shot. And don't play it like game - feel it, live in it. Because it's how it's meant to be. Because it's worth it. And remember - trust nobody, question everything.			"

 A measly review wouldn't do this game justice. I've had this game outside of Steam for quite a while now:For years, games come out one after another in a specific genre with the sole intention of being better than the last in many fields, or being unique in a multitude of ways. The genre of ""RPG"" or ""shooter"" is one that is often explored to the very end of it's capabilities - the introduction of new technology in games like Fallout 4 and The Witcher 3 are games that were and are very easily promised Game of the Year time and time again. But through the embers of blazing releases and trailers, there is a game that pioneered a variety of things in undue time.And a measly review wouldn't do it justice.Deus Ex is most likely one of the best games I've ever played. It's old, unoptimized, and sluggish nature is something I can very easily ignore and regard as setbacks of the age it was released in. Though it's time deteoriorated the mechanics and features, it also gave it an advantage - it shook the medium, and the seismic shock can still be felt to this day. The story is something that draws you in and immerses you into a world of conspiracy. The music is a lovely additive, and you can feel every synth, piano key, and guitar riff even for the time it was composed. The set pieces are convincing, well-made, and lovingly crafted with attention given all the way down to the back bowels of a New York City borough. Deus Ex is a marvel of engineering for the year 1999, and it's accomplishments can be appreciated in the present time.Buy this game and play it through if you haven't already. DO IT. "

												It's not easy to review Deus Ex. So much can be said about it, but then, so much already has. There is a good chance you have already played and completed it - but if not, allow me to suggest why you should. Deus Ex is an FPS/RPG sci-fi masterpiece, packed with action, stealth, conspiracies and philosophy. You will often find it referred to as 'greatest game ever' or at least in many people's Top 10 list, and you might wonder what the appeal is. Even fans can agree that it’s not the best looking game out there. The enemy AI isn't great and the voice acting... well, the less said, the better. These flaws aren’t very subtle either, they are quite blatant - so if the game has these problems, how can so many people find it so amazing? What defines a great game is not an absence of flaws, but an experience so rich and rewarding that any flaws - no matter how obvious - are happily ignored because they do not detract from the game overall.Nevertheless - do people claim Deus Ex is great just because of nostalgia goggles? Yes and no. Deus Ex pioneered a number of things that have become standard practice since, and so someone coming to it completely fresh won't find it as innovative as someone who played it when it was first released. Despite that, it still shines when it comes the most important part of the game - the story. If you are the sort of gamer who cares more about the polygon count, or skip through all the text so you can get back to the shooting, this might not be the game for you. For everyone else, prepare for a wonderfully rich and detailed world with secrets around every corner. Prepare for characters that will assist you with vital information, only to find out later that they were lying through their teeth to manipulate you into furthering their own plans. Prepare for hidden agendas, dangerous enemies, international conspiracies and difficult choices.Deus Ex is designed so well that despite being very linear, if feels like an open world game. Every level has different methods of approach that can completely change your game experience. Most importantly - your actions have consequences. It's not usually as blatant as 'go this way to save this character or this way to save this character' but far more subtle, with different ideas and philosophies introduced to you for you to decide which one you think should be the right choice.It's my favourite game. Many others say the same. This review, as well as all others, is attempting to put into words something better left unsaid - something far better experienced. It's Deus Ex. What more can you say?

												Deus Ex's bland graphics, questionable AI and somewhat clumsy gameplay can't hide its age, but its unique mix of first-person action, puzzle and RPG elements with a bold, groundbreaking focus on story and characters changed the landscape, and would signifcantly influence developers for the decade to come, demonstrating that a game can share qualities of film or literature and still be successfull. It's exploration of human nature is still valid now, more than a decade later. If only Ion Storm had replayed this game before making Invisible War... If you're not a graphics aficionado, and don't require the latest in tessellation, filtering, or ambient occlusion to have an engaging experience, Deus Ex may be worth your time. If you don't know what any of those are, this is even more likely the case. Being a prequel with some of the same characters, Human Revolution also draws many call-backs (or ""forwards"") to this game.			"

												Deus Ex, or ""God within"" if you wish, is one of those games which defined what a good game should be.  It brings you into a world where every conspiracy you've ever heard of is true.  The Illuminatti, the Majestic 12, the myths about Area 51, every one of them.  Then they ask you, what kind of person are you?  Every choice you make has reprecussions.  Every person you kill has their blood on your hands.  Every door that is opened shuts another.  What kind of world will there be when your journey is done?Notes:  This game is UGLY and requires internet patches to get working on Modern computers, however once you enter the world you won't want to leave without seeing everything through to the bitter end.  The gameplay is solid.  The storyline is great, even by modern standards.  And the world feels amazingly real once you get past the bad graphics.  Don't miss out on this masterpiece.			"

												A milestone in the history of games. The first game which came to my mind instantly when I wanted to nominee one game for the Steam Awards in the ""Test of Time"" category. It's now almost 17 years after it's initial release and it's still one of the best games ever made. If you have only the slightest interest in rpgs, shooter, stealth or narrative driven games then you have to play this game.Maybe the only game in which I've found countless new possibilites, secrets, dialogues or level areas even after I've played it now more than a dozen times from beginning to end. The amount of freedom you have as a player is monumental, you can be  very creative in how you want to play all the brilliantly designed levels, Gameplay mechanics, narrative and sound design are also extremly well made. I also suggest that you play this game vanilla at least once or twice before you alter the experience with some (well made) mods out there.			"

DEUS EX - Every time you mention it, someone will reinstall it.Three years after I first played Deus Ex: Human Revolution and enjoyed it immensely, it was finally time for its big brother. I tried the original Deus Ex a few years ago, but I just couldn't get passed its outdated visuals (including New Vision) and especially its awful animations. Which I think is probably typical for the Deus Ex series, since Human Revolution also wasn't a looker to begin with. But I suppose I kinda matured in terms of gaming in the last two years, because when I started Deus Ex again a few months ago, the visuals didn't bother me.But enough about me. Besides the convincing dystopia future with its own share of society problems dripping with atmosphere, I needed some time to adjust to the gameplay. Because it has been quite some time that a game didn't spoon-fed me how to play the game or which way to go with a huge pointer on-screen. Overwhelming at first, but the level of player freedom makes you comfortable very quickly. You get a relatively big area each level where you can go where ever you please, do whatever you want in a manner you find appropriate. The excellent level designs makes sure of that. Later on, based on the augmentations you choose, you get even more options that suit your play style. No wrongs or rights.+ Excellent level design, a lot of player freedom, all roads lead to Rome.+ Not a single moment of holding hands, just good ol' fashioned exploration and finding the way on your own.+ Dystopia cyberpunk future and its problems are represented very well and convincing. + A great story to boot that rarely to never loses its grip.+ A lot of choices and consequences that can make your life later on easier or harder.+ Great atmosphere and an even better soundtrack.- Ugly face animations, probably even for 2000 standards.- Mediocre/static voice acting, except Bob Page whom I thought sounded excellent.- Stupid AI, though understandable considering it's 15 years old now.I still prefer Human Revolution (first love and all that), but now I can understand where most of its brilliance comes from. If the next Deus Ex, Mankind Divided, can combine the strengths from both Deus Ex 1 and Human Revolution, and somehow iron out their respective little flaws, Mankind Divided will be a very, very unforgettable experience. The hype is real.9/10			"

												This game is one of the best I've played. Before I got into sandbox games like The Elder Scrolls and Fallout series of games I played Deus Ex. This plays differently than both of those titles, but it does sanbox play in its own way very well. The game can be advanced in any way you desire, be it stealth gameplay, run&gun, smash things with a crowbar, hacking terminals, killing everything you see, non-lethal takedowns, etc...You also have access to a rudimentary skill system that allows you to focus your expertise in whichever areas you so choose. You can be extremely skilled with handguns or relatively skilled with rifles, heavy wepons and melee weapons. You can increase the effectiveness of your medkits to heal you for more or focus on avoiding combat by getting more usefulness out of your lockpicks and multitools (high tech lockpicks for security doors and cameras).You will gain access to augmentations for your character as well. These are upgrades that have an active effect when you need it most at the cost of bio-electrical energy (basically a secondary resource like mana). These augs can be chosen from one of two per body part. You can augment your arms to deal tremendous melee damage or give you the strength to move heavy objects. You can augment your legs to give you faster movement speed or increase the height you can jump as well as ruduce falling damage. You can augment your lungs to allow you to hold your breath for longer periods underwater or to filter harmful substances from poisoned or irradiated areas. You can augment your skin to reduce damage from projectile wepons or from energy/fire weapons. There are many different combinations you can choose from, and each will help a particular style of gameplay. The choices are left entirely to you.Then there's the story. I won't give away spoilers, but know that nothing is what it seems nor is anyone who they really seem. There are many great twists and turns beofre you reach the end, and there are several different endings depending on your actions throughout the game. You can advance the story any way you want through your actions and dialogue choices. Deus Ex does this very well by allowing you to decide for yourself what actions you want to take in any given situation. Did that guy betray you? You can trust that he won't do it again, not trust him and never deal with him again or kill him for screwing you over. For every choice you make there will be some sort of effect on some aspect of the game, be it causing you to switch alliances or just a quirky dialogue change. Due to this there is a great deal of replayability that will keep you playing through over and over to see what would happen if you did things differently.Remember that this game was released in 2000, so don't expect hyper-realistic visuals and sound effects or nop-notch voice acting. What this game does best is to deliver a fun, memorable gaming experiece that sets it apart from your average yearly installment of CoD.BE FOREWARNED: To those who come from playing games like The Elder Scrolls and Fallout you will have to leave items on the ground never to be seen again. There is no storage nor are there vendors. The game revolves around you only taking what you inetend to use. It kills me coming back to this game after playing Skyrim. I hate leaving rocket launchers and flamethrowers behind due to my compulsive desire to take everything, but after a little while you get accustomed to it. As you increase your skills in certain areas you will find weapons you don't specialize in are less desirable due to their ineffectiveness and lack of monetary value. I specialize in handguns, and in leveling my skills in that area the usage of handguns becomes more fluid. I become more accurate, can use them more effectively while running, deal more damage with them, etc.., while with a sniper rifle I would have to stand still for a good ten seconds to get a good bead on my target, have a hard time aiming and deal less damage. It gets to the point where when I see a rocket launcher lying on the ground I don't even want to pick it up.I would highly recommend Deus Ex to anyone who enjoys a game with a good mix of story, solid gameplay, freedom of choice, decision making and consequence. 10/10 a classic.

												For those of us who remember the N64, Goldeneye 007 was up there with Ocarina of Time, and Super Mario 64 as one of the most popular games of the system. Deus Ex reminds me in many ways of Goldeneye.The gameplay is unmatched. Every level presents new scenery and new challenges. Just like in Goldeneye, you have various objectives that must be completed. And to complete the objectives, you have to deal with enemies as well as many other hazards, There are multiple ways to get to the objectives; do you clear the resistance or do you use your tools to get through the securely locked doors? This game features level ups in the form of augmentations and skill points. Skill points are gained by finding secrets and clearing objectives and can be used to better your skills, while augmentations are enhancements that can enable you to do things like healing, causing enemies to blow themselves up with rockets, or seeing through walls! You find these in canisters; found throughout certain areas. It's a fun game and for all you diehard Goldeneye fans (and even if you aren't), you'll love this game. Quite frankly, I don't know why anyone wouldn't. So go and get it.			"

												In the opinion of many professional (and unprofessional) video game reviewers and commentators, Deus Ex is hailed as one of the singular greatest arguement for the greatest game of all time. The in-depth story is as long as it is captivating, taking the player on a global journey from New York City, to Shanghai, to Paris and California and a rather surprising ending location. The story is unparralled in it's depth and creativity, despite broaching a genre which has been entrenched in many fictional works. The gameplay is superb, and serves as a model for close to every FPS/RPG succeading it. Ultimately, the excellence of this work is somewhat inhibited due to the aged graphics which it holds, the faces being a notable point of contention. But this minimially detracts from the experiance, and the atmosphere is unparalled despite this. However, Deus Ex belonged to a generation of games helmed by Warren Spector and other early PC innovators. This collection of programmers and coders worked on some of the most renowned games of all time, System Shock 2 (1999), Thief (1998), and other celebrated classics. They run in tandem with a more focused RPG genre, led by the Fallout games, Elder Scrolls games and other Dungeons and Dragons isometric games largely held as the culmination of masterpieces for the PC. In a sense, Deus Ex is sort of the harbinger of a new age for PC games, one which sort of loses a touch which System Shock 2, Thief and Deus Ex had, and this is inherent within the sequel, which abandons many of the tropes which made Deus Ex a masterpiece. Morrowind serves a similar function albeit for the RPG side, with Oblivion and Skyrim notably streamlining many RPG aspects within that particular game. That is not to say the sequels for Deus Ex are bad. On the contrary, Invisible War is good - but strange. Human Revolution however is noteworthy and worth a playthrough, if only for the grandiose set-up it leaves for this game. Overall this series is one of the innovators within gaming, and thus should be worth consideration.			"

												Solid Game.Although it was made in 2000 and some of the controls are a little messy. Using the 10 or so augmentations or powers requires pressing the F1, F2, ..., F12 keys, but they can be re-mapped in the options menu. Thank God.The game does a good job at letting you play to your own playstyle. Going loud or stealthy both work. I personally tried a non-lethal stealth approach the beginning of the game, until I realized that tranquilizer darts take a few seconds to kick in. That's when I decided to make the switch to lethal, but silenced weapons. Something I wish I knew earlier. The story can also change depending on what decisions you make in the game. Become allies with certain people, and you might get better stuff. I haven't flushed out this system for myself yet, however.Also, think hardly about what augmentations you want. They're permanent. While a spy drone may sound cool, a defense augmentation can go a long way when you need it.This game reminds me a lot of the Half Life. Great level design and story. I only wish we had a sequel with JC Denton in it, instead of what we have in Deus Ex: Invisible War. He seems like a cool guy. RIP.Mind you, I did apply some mods to up texture resolutions, and to fix some game-breaking bugs that apparently existed. With a 750ti, the game runs at a smooth 144 FPS. It's an old game, what do you expect?I'd rate this sucker a 8.5/10. I'd give it an extra point if it had a better UI and augmentation controls.			"

												Its storyline is gripping, the environment rich, a lot of people to talk to, many sidequests to solve.You can choose how to complete a level (melée, infiltration, sniping etc.) and combine all of those.The development of Your capabities is three-fold: You can level up Your skills, aquire augmentations (special powers) and get weapon modifications - some of these You can combine to some degree (e.g. You can get temporary weapon skill increase by using an aug instead of increasing the weapon skill), so combining them intelligently definitely will give You an edge on the field.The setting itself is futuristic cyberpunk world, full of conspiracies, where the protagonist have to try his best to staly alive and further the agenda of one group or another - because in Deus Ex Your choices have consequences, and these may not be readily apparent.A 1000 Kudos to the creators, May Your BioEnergy Never Deplete!

												I want to tell you a story. It has spoilers, so consider yourself warned.My JC Denton was a good agent. In the field, he was an intelligent, efficient snipe-happy hacker, with a pistol for emergencies. (Side note: Silenced sniper rifle + laser-sight pistol, both at Advanced skill level =OP.)However, when he infiltrated the building Paul Denton told him to to show him that UNATCO was corrupt, my JC mixed up his objectives and went to the roof, where the satellite dish he was supposed to change if Paul was correct was located, instead of the basement, where the proof was. This was a bit of a dilemma.Then my JC Denton had an epiphany.He realized that he would work for whichever side allowed him to shoot, loot, and hack as much as possible. So right then and there, my JC hacked the satellite dish and looted what was inside, betraying his country for some immediate cheap thrills. Don't get me wrong, he wasn't psychotic; my JC was just extremely vindictive, self-righteous, and challenge-seeking, and he had a lot of guns.He then went through the rest of the game, shooting and looting and hacking all over the place, and when the time came, he took the only sensible option and merged with Helios.Deus Ex has a lot of problems. It looks awful, there aren't enough character options for the action-oriented player, the voice acting is atrocious, and some enemies have way too much health (lookin' at you, greasels). However, any game with this amount of player choice and understanding of the player (one time, when lost and trying to leave a cathedral, I walked up to a French chef and JC promptly asked how the hell to get out of there) deserves whatever recommendations it can get.Seriously though, f*ck all the transgenics.

												Deus Ex is set in a dystopian middle of the 21st century, filled with religious extremists and powerful organizations, and stricken by a devastating new plague. The main character is JC Denton, a nano-augmented agent working for an international counter-terrorist organization. But as the plot unfolds, we realize that the situation is much more complex that what we expected.Released around the year 2000, Deus Ex provides outdated graphics and sound effects (even for its time, it was not the state-of-the-art). The musics are simple, and the AI is not very clever. Yet, the game has two major qualities.First, its complex and deep storyline. Various organisations are involved (terrorists, Illuminatis, Chinese triads, corrupt military forces, rogue artificial intelligence, political plotters, etc.) and all are related to each others. So, many 	unforeseen developments will occur, JC Denton will have to find out everyone's true motives, and where to put his trust. All of this allows for an extremely long single-player campaign, with many different levels and chapters. And if that was not enough, the game is full of philosophical and political cyberpunk-themed reflections (freedom of the people vs efficency of the state, the foreseen dependance of our modern society on connectivity...).Then, its extremely well designed gameplay. Deux Ex is a mix of RPG and FPS. The RPG part provides secondary quests, hidden objectives, useful and talkative NPCs, and choices to make that will influence the storyline (several endings are possible). There is also a system of skills and nano-augmentations, that you will have to manage in order to build up your character the way you want. This strongly influences the FPS part, which can be either infiltration or action-oriented, depending on how you upgraded JC Denton, or managed your items inventory. There are also many ways to complete the game, as Deux Ex will almost always provides several solutions to solve an issue.Thus, Deux Ex is a very intelligent game, with a great plot and a very interesting gameplay. It's not surprising some call it a masterpiece, and if you've never tried it before, you should.			"

You have five different ways of performing a task as simple as opening a door. While playing this game you are constantly questioning humanity, morality, and society. Who do you trust and what consequences are you willing to accept? Should you eradicate your misguided and well intentioned enemies or sneak through with the constant fear of death? One way or another, you are JC Denton. Your nanosuit and augmentations put you at Captain Falcon levels of awesome. I played this game in 2012, so there's no nostalgia blurring my view. In this timeframe I also played titans like Half Life 2, Mass Effect, and Bioshock. This blows them all out of the water.

												This is one of the best games I've played, and I've played and finished it in 2016, 16 years after its release. I first played Human Revolution. Whilst the hacking system is better in HR, this original game is also fantastic. There are multiple ways of playing this game, but you'll find you get more satisfaction from playing stealthy. Don't worry if you don't, you won't be penalised for it. You can play it as an action shooter if you like. The reason I clocked up 40 hours on one play through is mainly because I'd reloaded if I wasn't happy with my play style, or if I messed up my stealth.The augmentations are a blast! The Ai's pretty funny as well.I'd recommended this game to fans of Metal Gear Solid, Splinter Cell, and BioShock. Even Half-Life fans would enjoy this because of it's story. The RPG elements are simply that, you don't need to go around grinding to level up or anything.The lore and the story of this game are spot on. The world isn't thrown in your face, it's yours to explore, and the story is enough. I get irritated with a lot of games now trying to be action movies. This game doesn't do that, it's a good honest title.TAKE NOTE:Make sure you safe frequently and often -- don't rely on binding quick saves. Mine corrupted, and it seems a common issue. Make manual saves, I'm afraid e.g. <level name> suffixed with 'after guards', 'before aug', etc. I had gigabytes worth -- they take up a lot of space!			"

The story is compelling, the visuals aren't that bad, the music is dynamic and addictive, and the gameplay is very non-linear. You can be stealthy or you can go in guns blazing. There are lots of ways to complete missions and lots of secrets to find. Cannot recommend this game enough.			"

												The best video game of all time, bar none; the sequels Invisible War (horrible game) and Human Revolution don't even come close. The game takes place in the year 2052 where the world has become a ghetto ravaged by war, terrorism, and disease. A new plague, known as the Gray Death, is spreading rapidly with no cure; only a vaccine known as Ambrosia can prevent infection, and only if you can keep taking it. Worst of all, production is extremely limited and most of it is rationed out to key government and utility workers. You play as UNATCO (United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition) agent J.C. Denton, fresh out of the academy, on his first mission to reacquire a supply of Amrbosia that has been stolen by the terrorist group NSF (National Secessionist Forces). But it doesn't take long to figure out that something much more sinister is going on.Deus Ex features incorporates conspiracy theries (Illuminati, Trilateral Commission, Knights Templar, Majestic 12, etc) into a well-integrated cyberpunk storyline. It is the most cerebral game I've ever played, which focuses on the ideas of liberty and authority with very intelligent dialogue.The gameplay is incredible as well. Deus Ex is a FPS/RPG hybrid and the best I've seen in it's genre. You gain skill points that you can invest into different skills, such as Heavy Weaponry, Lockpicking, or Medicine. You also receive nano-augmentations throughout the game that can be toggled on or off at the expense of bioelectrical enegry, such as Quiet Movement or Invisibility.The only downside to this game, if you want to call it that, is that the graphics are outdated as the game came out in 2000. However, there are lots of mods that improve things like texture quality which make the game more visually pleasing. If you were a PC gamer around the time though (Half Life, Unreal, Tribes, etc) then it shouldn't phase in you the least bit.Play this game NOW. You're not a real PC gamer if you haven't. 10/10.

												Deus Ex is often claimed to be the best game in computer game history. Personally I agree but it's not without it's problems. Join me while I take a look at this critically praised title.The StoryDeus Ex begins in the docks of the island where the statue of liberty is located at. The island is under lockdown because of a terrorist attack by an organization called ""NSF"" that has managed to overtake the entire island. You are ""JC"" Denton, a nano augmented super agent working for the security agency UNATCO (United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition) and your task is to infiltrate the statue of liberty and capture the leader of the terrorist attack alive. You meet up with your brother: Paul Denton which gives you a weapon and the location of a contact that can help JC into the statue. JC is later tasked with working under the supervision of his machine augmented collegue Anna Navarre in several tasks related to attacks against the NSF. The story has no problem introducing new characters to you. All the major characters you meets are colorful and memorable but most of all they feel real.Level DesignWhen you exit the docks you come across patrolling terrorists pretty much instantly. How you prefer to go up to the tower of liberty is entirely up to you as there are a number of ways to do so. The level design in this very first level is optimized to be as open as possible with plenty of secrets so it makes newcomers confused as to where to start and how to approach the problem. If you search around you will find to be able to get the Sniper rifle and the Crossbow on the very first level of the game.The other levels in the game varies with open areas and enclosed areas but they're never entirely linear. They are more often than not full of branching paths but of course there are a few linear levels which JC has to venture though but even those can be progressed through in different ways, making for a truly varied experience. Almost all levels in the game allows for a subtle approach (or even several) but a direct assault approach is never out of the question either. However, the game rewards subtle approaches more than lethal ones which is apparent even in the first few levels of the game.There is however one level that I want to bring up, directly before you arrive in Hong Kong - where you need to rescue your helicopter from a hangar of some sort: While not being a bad level in it's own right - this level did not add anything to the game and felt entirely unnecessary to me.RPG ElementsJC Denton starts out with a couple of skill points which he invests in different skills. These are in several different areas ranging from very useful to merely a convenience. The developers are aware of the convenience skills and they cost a lot less than the more essential skills that you can invest in. So if you want to be able to be a great swimmer it will not cost as much as being a good hacker or a good shooter but it will still cost something. Even if you don't have any skills in the different areas you will still be able to do these tasks - albeit at a higher cost of the resources to carry out the tasks. For example you might come across a locked door. If you are untrained in lockpicking you will only be able to unlock 10 points (of a universal maximum of 100) from the lock per lockpick. As the tools of these trades are relatively difficult to acquire large numbers of and locked doors being plentiful this skill easily turns out to be one of the most useful ones. So if you're untrained you will merely have to be more selective in the doors you want to try and unlock. If you run out you can also sometimes just blow up the door with explosives but the explosives in this game is even more rare than lockpicks. Unlike lockpicks though - explosives mostly only need 1 charge to succeed.Deus Ex also features an ""augmentation"" system where you get to choose between different buffs and abilities JC will permanently be outfitted with during the game. JC can choose between being better at smashing peoples skulls in with melee weapons or lifting heavy boxes and crates. One allows JC to take people down in one hit and the other allows him to bring cover or trap people. You also get other kinds of abilities like being able to either be invisible to people or to cameras or being able to see details of your target (like health and weapons) or have night & heat vision. You always have to choose between two augmentations that works in similar ways but they also need to be upgraded and upgrading is something I think the game could have done without; because without the need to upgrade, augmentations could have been playing a larger role (especially in the early parts of the game) instead of being a bonus on top of JC's more useful Skills system.Combat and StealthBecause this is an RPG - Deus Ex's combat changes according to the skills JC acquires during the game. The game favors silent takedowns as the game isn't afraid of pitting you against several enemies at once, but in a way it is possible to try and engage the enemy with lethal weapons as well but perhaps not as rewarding. Eventually though JC pretty much needs to equip himself with some form of lethal weapons due to the increase of armored enemies during the later stages of the game. This oddly enough gives a sense of progression and a strange dynamic to the fights where you have to use the less lethal weapons against human grunts and the lethal ones against the tougher ones.There is one strange thing with Deus Ex's aiming system where you have to crouch in order to get maximum accuracy. It's mainly a way to allow players who doesn't have good fighting skills to still be able to defeat someone with a gun. The games has some other, more desirable options open for such players such as throwing grenades and using pepper spray.Of course sneaking is the greatest asset to JC and you don't have to skill up in order to be a great ninja in this game. In fact: JC starts as a pretty good ninja right from the start. As long as the player sticks to the shadows or behind the enemy he's not going to be able to see JC coming and be entirely in the mercy of the players whims.ConclusionDeus Ex does have it's problems, just like every single other game but somehow what Deus Ex tries really works. The story, despite it's weaknesses is ultimately very good. The pacing is brisk and you're never without any goals. The level design ranks as one of the best in games up to this point. And unlike so many other games from 2000 this game actually looks really good. Much of what isn't done very good or great is at least solid and the game has very few apparent weaknesses.Most games I play have quirks that makes the experience playing them somewhat worse by being central mechanics. Deus Ex's problems are very minor in comparison of it's qualities. The augmentation system that I mentioned earlier is after all ""a bonus"" since JC's power really comes from his skills system. That's why I believe Deus Ex is as great as gaming has ever gotten and deserve a 6 out of 6.			"

It wasn't until a few missions/hours in that I was really hooked, but as the story became more understandable and the levels more varied (and there are a lot), I got to look past the dated graphics and A.I., and found a really deep, enthralling title with lots of rewarding exploration and true varied playstyles: you can complete any level how you want and there are a number of ways to do it. I would recommend Deus Ex to any fan of shooters, as it can fit almost all shooter playstyles: run and gun, stealth and snipe, superhuman abilities, melee, etc. The story and voice acting is great, and a long, content-filled adventure of conspiracy and tension.

Nowadays it lacks some of the simple things like changing music, more kinds of different npc looks, and overall a better.Nothing of that was bad, but after about 2 hours per level listening to the same music my head started to hurt.This game got some things even current games lack: - Full voice cast- Manymany items, not only useful ones.- Big world with many places you actually don't have to visit- A choice between good or bad (kill or sneak in this case)- A complex story.Too bad after 14 hours (with at least 6 hours to go) the game crashed at a certain point, no matter which savegame I used or which of the multiple ways I went.

Its one of those games where you never want to really finish it because its so good, you dont want to see the ending come just yet. Ive reinstalled 3 times already and still havent seen the endingThe level design is very open and large for its time, Im always impressed at how many paths are crammed into the level without being to obvious. This is a short review, Its my favorite game of all time, it has flaws, but those flaws give it some character. I highly suggest you hop into it if you ever have a weekend to get ingulfed in a game. The first 2 levels arent top tier by any means, so dont let  them drive you off like they made me for awhile. I played this in 2014, and loved it. So dont believe the very few haters of this game when they say only people who played it when it came out like the game. "

Ill toss my opinion in the sea of maymay reviews and BOMBs etc etcIll start off with the badThe gameplay is clunkyThe graphics are♥♥♥♥♥♥br>The game will most likely run like♥♥♥♥♥♥without a fanmade patch or fix like DEUSEXEThe voice acting is bad and can have some very bad actors here and thereNow for the goodThe voice acting is bad and can have some very bad actors here and there (its one of those wierd quirks in the game that makes it enjoyable and unique, not just a bunch of british people making everything sound dramatic)The graphics, while bad, have a style to them that I havent seen matched in any other game, not even the subsequent Deus Exes... its very dirty and cool temperant with all the blues and greys, with vibrant colors sprinkled across the levels to keep it just interesting enough to the eyeThe gameplay is indeed garbage, but it has a charm to it as well, it hard to explain and very subjective, but you might find yourself laughing your♥♥♥♥♥off after you smack a guard in  the back of the head with a baton and he falls flat on his faceThe real gem of the game is the story and writting as well as characters and twists in the plot. Its one of those games where you never want to really finish it because its so good, you dont want to see the ending come just yet. Ive reinstalled 3 times already and still havent seen the endingThe level design is very open and large for its time, Im always impressed at how many paths are crammed into the level without being to obvious. This is a short review, Its my favorite game of all time, it has flaws, but those flaws give it some character. I highly suggest you hop into it if you ever have a weekend to get ingulfed in a game. The first 2 levels arent top tier by any means, so dont let  them drive you off like they made me for awhile. I played this in 2014, and loved it. So dont believe the very few haters of this game when they say only people who played it when it came out like the game. "

												I've just beaten the game yesterday--first playthrough--and I've had a bit of time to reflect. I wish that I hadn't read a ton of reviews of people building this game up to be the best game ever. So if you haven't played yet, my advice is to go into it expecting that it'll be above average for its time (also assuming you're old enough to know what to expect from that era :P ). I think you'll enjoy it a lot more.I went in with VERY high expectations on the storyline becuase of all the reviews on here and wound up underwhelmed. Not only at the end of the game, but throughout as well. Just always wondering when it was gonna get really good. While the storyline was ok, I was never drawn in by it, and my reaction at some plot twists was more ""huh...didn't expect that,"" than actual surprise.One main reason I never got pulled into the story was the absolutely horrible voice acting. They had 1 real person doing voices for like 15 different characters. With the lack of facial variation in the game, I was often confused if it was a new or old character I'd just met up with. The reason the individual voice acting was so bad is there was a complete lack of emotion in the voices. Impressively lacking I'd say. Like they grabbed people off the street. At first I thought it was about concerns for the size for the game fitting on disks back then, but the voices actually have acceptable bandwidth, just no change in pitch or volume. Finally in the last hours of the game ONE of the characters was emotive, raising their voice and changing the stress in the voice. Who knows, maybe it WAS a disk space thing, I'm not an expert.As you may have noticed, I do recommend the game. It's pretty good, and I hope I can relect on its backstory for when I play the later games (I know to skip Invisible War). But I think that there are a LOT of people who view it through star-struck eyes because they played it when it came out or it was the first game of this type that they played. Just as the original Halo has a special place in my heart, I realize I probably wouldn't think so highly of it if I started with the latest FPS games and THEN played Halo for the first time. But aside from Golden Eye, that was the first game of that sort I ever played--and right when it came out--so it left a huge impression on me.			"

												Deus Ex is undoubtedly one of the best games I have ever played and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys an FPS/Si-Fi/RPG that also has an amazing story and gameplay. Among other things what I loved most about this game is the incredible ammount of choices that differ from choosing how you will take out a group of enemy or wether an NPC lives or not. Overall, Deus Ex is a masterpiece that any gamer would enjoy.			"

												Minor spoilers below.One of the most beloved classics, Deus Ex's gameplay hasn't aged too well (although Deus Ex: Revision helps) but I still recommend it to anyone who loves Human Revolution, Mankind Divided, or games with similar themes (Metal Gear Solid franchise).It was one of the earliest hybrid FPS/RPG games, taking after the System Shock games but being far less linear and more ambitious.  Overall I'd say it has a slightly more ""choice and consequence"" than Human Revolution, with unforeseen consequences happening much later in the game resulting from not so obvious choices unlike today's games.  Both this and Human Revolution have a ""button press"" style ending although it isn't literally just a button press like Human Revolution is.One of the major distinguishing factors between Deus Ex and Deus Ex: Human Revolution is the overall style the games go for.  Deus Ex has a sort of 80s action style, evident in the soundtrack and protagonist dialogue (man of few words who tends to deliver one liners).  Human Revolution and Mankind Divided on the other hand have a more serious and grim tonality.  Despite this different in style, both games end up feeling quite similar.  Vaguely similar gameplay, similar emphasis on exploration (improved in Human Revolution courtesy of more detailed levels and even bigger, content heavy hubs contrary to popular belief, at the cost of less total levels), similar environments and similar story themes.As far as story goes, Deus Ex is undoubtedly more complex than Human Revolution and most other games in existence.  It has so many plot elements going on at once, yet it never burdens itself or becomes confusing.  The dialogue isn't excellent, and it does have numerous moments of absurdity but not any worse than most films (e.g., we're supposed to believe that Denton easily bribes is way into a top secret facility, or how you travel to Area 51 right after nuking it and there's no radiation anywhere).  If this game were to be remade with largely revised dialogue and without the things I just described, it would be one of the best video game stories ever, but as it stands it is still well above average.  One of the reasons this game was named ""Deus Ex"" was because it tries to make it a point to not rely on Deus Ex Machina.As most would expect by now, Deus Ex does make use of environmental storytelling, although Human Revolution actually does a better job at this thanks to even greater levels of detail.  There is so much interaction in all levels of both games, and so much exploration.  When exploring and interacting you will find lots of reading material, whether it's newspapers (or Human Revolution's oddly more advanced equivalent), computers, datacubes, excerpts from books with thematic similarities, etc.There are often debates about whether or not this game is better than Human Revolution.  Truthfully, both games are so good that everyone who likes one game should try the other.  Human Revolution has slightly better character development and dialogue, it has one of the best persuasion systems ever made, it has much better stealth gameplay primarily due to the AI (in Deus Ex, if one person sees you or is wounded without even seeing you, every enemy in the vicinity knows your precise location for the next 20 seconds or so).  Many like to praise Deus Ex's level design (the openness and interactivity) but Human Revolution is not only more detailed, but its hubs (Detroit and most of all Hengsha) are MUCH larger with far more content (side quests). Both games showcase lots of dynamic physics effects to boost environmental interaction.  Deus Ex does not have a cover system like Human Revolution does.  It has first-person shooter mechanics with leaning.  Compared to Human Revolution it has more activated/hotkeyed augmentations which is nice.  You are certainly more powerful and advanced in this game than in Human Revolution, which makes sense considering Deus Ex takes place over 20 years later.  Denton has nano-augmentations rather than mechanical.The AI can really take a lot of enjoyment out of both stealth and combat, and so does the primitive clunky aiming/crosshair system.  Also it's terrible that cameras are invulnerable in Deus Ex... one of few synthetic limitations it has.  Furthermore this game's balance is off; harder difficulties simply make the player more vulnerable but not so much the other way around, although this is fixed by Deus Ex: Revision which is another reason to play that instead of just this.  The mini-crossbow is worthless because it only grants an instant knockout if you hit the enemy in the back of the neck; if they aren't knocked out, then they along with all nearby enemies know your precise location for the next 20 seconds and rush you.  Deus Ex lacks in effective non-lethal stealth weaponry unlike Human Revolution.  The riot prod is really good, that's it.If you can deal with the terrible AI and clunky combat, then install this game and then install Deus Ex: Revision over it.  Play Deus Ex: Revision exclusively.  Read my review of that if you want to know more about it.			"

Gameplay is still fun, and while it can be a bit of a chore at times, it is quite enjoyable.For the time, I would say this game was 10/10Nowadays, I would say 8.7/10 Honestly, I found DX:HR more fun, but this game has aged so well you can't pass it up.Also, one of my Top 10 games of all time.

 Introduction Deus Ex is a first-person shooter published and developed by Ion Storm Houston in June 26, 2000. Directed by Warren Spector, Deus Ex is about one man’s destiny of becoming the God in the Machine to make a truly fair autonomous world government that appeals to the minds of the living – though this is only the first of many choices to take.Deus Ex is an incredibly influential game of it's time known for level design and scripting which has been designed towards various players actions that a player may take to complete an objective, a breakthrough in “emergent” gameplay and through experimentation secret dialogues and other rewards unlock through the exploration and reward.  Deus Ex’s setting is that of a futuristic cyberpunk world shrouded in ambiguity and fear as a nanite-virus known as the Grey Death spreads across the American continent and rural areas committing to the genocide of millions of people! The working classes, now cower in constant fear and terror of their government’s policies. It’s dark ambience and semi-realistic representation of 21st century world in turmoil coupled with the scale of its maps, intelligent design and humor help deliver an intense, conspiracy-themed world with high re-playability. Gameplay Deus Ex is a hybrid of First Person Shooter and Role Playing elements. Though semi-linear, there is many quests to do in the game which offers a challenge and reward of skill points or weapons/upgrades. There is a total of 10 skills in the game; Computer, Rifle, Low-Tech, Pistol, Heavy, Environmental Training, Swimming, Medicine, Electronics and Lockpicking.  These Skill upgrades improve Denton's ability to hack, swim (rarely used), shoot certain types of weapons without movement or accuracy penalties, regenerate more health, deactivate security restrictions such as a locked door to an armory or shop, gain access to robots interfaces and drones.4 difficulties are Easy, Medium, Hard and Realistic, all 3 increase NPC health and damage dealt but Realistic Realistic deals heavy damage on different body parts for both parties depending on what weapon is used to kill a target. Recommendations Lore-heavy with elements of interwoven themes concerning the socioeconomical abuse of a nation, the results of a corruptive government and the dangers of indiscriminate survillence giving the game a great sense of scale, depth, and mystery compared to games of its time.Modification friendly. Deus Ex uses Unreal engine to run so many SDK tools can be used to create new content. My recommended ones would be Deus Ex GMDX, Revision, Shifter and the tons at MODDB; http://www.moddb.com/games/deus-ex/mods Criticisms; Minor Requires Kentie’s Direct3D 10 renderer for extended options and playability.Deus Ex is very clunky gameplay wise with a considerable amount of skill bloat. To briefly explain this, a lot of augmentations overlap the Skills in the game such as Swimming and Environmental Training which are notorious for being the least useful skills to train in the game because they can be replaced with items or biological modification that do the same thing and better.Graphically poor, even for it’s time. Designs of certain weaposn are bland and nonsensical (such as the Stealth Pistol being a bullpup pistol) Animations are varied but stilted and wooden looking.Deus Ex's level design can be very confusing and maze-like at the end-game. The best thing to do is  is to explore and find new things. Gunplay The gunplay has a great selection of combat tools and different ammunition but is extremely clunky and spread is random until you gain the Targetting augmentation or use Gun Modifications to upgrade Accuracy of the selected weapon. You can use everything from Crowbars, Tasers to Rocket Launchers and Turrets (with the help of a Computer Skill) to take down enemies or you can use stealth and toss a throwing knife into the throat of a weary enemy. The game takes heavy considerations for what body parts are hit - for example, hitting a crowbar at the base of the spine will instantly knock or kill a target or a gunshot of a large rifle to the torso or head will terminate their life and in opposing manner you as well on Realistic Difficulty.  Music Deus Ex music was composed by Alexander Brandon, who is known for focusing heavily upon electronic and classical hybrids similar to Vangelis’ works. It is dynamic, peppy and very beat heavy - influenced in a unique way by the players actions. Assaulting enemies and friendlies will cause the music to be suddenly rough, choatic classic electronica hybrid ochestra (yes, it is THAT good) to a calm, placid ambient drone that heals the ears when visiting the bustling cities when walking around or sneaking. You should have a listen to Alexander Brandon's works as they are very sublime for their time. Graphics The Unreal 1 engine was updated in Deus Ex to allow for coloured lightmaps, textured shading, mipmapping, skeletal animation (to include more advanced animations). Though Deus Ex paled in graphics in comparison to other games, the world is still believable and large for it's time. Due to the expandability, the source code and SDK's packaged with Deus Ex, this produced many modifications from graphical, gameplay and to minor changes such as changes to HUD. Mechanics Deus Ex uses a 'Skill Point' design to allocated a fixed price of skill points which are earned by doing quests, use of dialogue, clever exploration or by experimenting with certain actions in the game's environment.Deus Ex awards exploration, inquistiveness and theres tons of hidden content, including story, items, mini-quests and lets you play as if it were an open-world and it gets better from there! Many, many guns to choose from, many ways to play stealthy or violently.Deus Ex makes much use of emergent gameplay, meaning your actions can take serious consequences and changes to rewards and storyline. The very first level can be played in many different ways - some that you would think the developer would miss! Storyline The introduction begins with two mysterious figures amongst a large statue of a hand palming the globe, explaining their plans for a new augmentation project and the virus known as Grey Death.Meanwhile… J.C Denton, a rookie officer at UNATCO is briefed to take action and arrest an NSF commander by his brother Paul Denton. UNATCO is an anti-terrorist organisation founded after the Statue of Liberty was blown up by Northwest/Nationalist Secessionist Forces, a “terrorist” group. J.C Denton is sent with his brother Paul Denton to find the source of the deadly plague that haunts American civilizations with an atmosphere of death and secret control. The player as JC finds out more and more about the sinister plague and the lack of Ambrosia, its cure. This leads you, the player (and by extension JC) into finding out much more than what meets the eye as you find leads all round the world leading you to the ultimate conspiracy.			"

												Deus Ex! A Nanopunk/Cyberpunk themed action role playing game, combining first person shooter, stealth and role playing elements.Developed by ION Storm and Published by Eidos Interactive/SQUARE ENIX and designed by Warren Spector and Harvey Smith.Set in a dystopian world druing the year 2052 the plot follows UNATCO Agent JC Denton to combat terrorist forces. As the plot thickens Denton becomes entangled in a dark and deep ancient conspiracy.A game that has received universal acclaim and recieved multiple awards!The games storyline is unmatched by any other, the blending of genres: Role-playing, FPS, Adventure and Immersive Simulation makes this game the greatest of all time. Touches a lot on world affairs and it really takes a hold of you throwing you into dark and deep government conspiraciesGood:-The story is truly amazing it will overpower you!-The gameplay incoporates four genres and it blends together perfectly-Expansive environments with a lot of exploration.-Dialogue and back story improves the overall experience and there are some funny and cheesy one liners from NPCs.-RPG Elements are designed very well-The soundtrack of Deus Ex is flawless! The music really adds to the experience and the atmosphere, with subtle ambient street music to blasting bass/electronic tracks in combat.-Highly replayable I have played through at least 10 times.-The games graphics although not amazing really add to the atmosphere of a dark world which really puts Deus Ex into context.Bad:-Nothing, this game is flawless.There will never be a game in my heart that will replace this masterpiece of a game!Worth the experience, worth the penny, worth playing at least ten times!10 Foxes out of 10 Foxes :D			"

												Fifteen years and some forty save files later I'm STILL finding new things almost every time I open this game. It's amazing that Deus Ex managed to pack enough worthwhile content to make every playthrough feel unique, and not just in the game's scenarios themselves, but how you handle them. Every single weapon and aug has potential to do great things depending on how you build your character, with the exception of extremely situational, one use items like the P2000, or gimmicky augs like the Spybot. Deus Ex is a game that's hard to compare to others, because of how neatly the package is tied together. It's the way the atmospheric elements like music or even something as simple as lighting combine with the meandering you'll end up doing in the game's hub-worlds, and the hubs are where Deus Ex becomes a completely different expirience. Sure it's fun to play one of the good ol' linear levels with fairly straightforward objectives, but the sprawling, open areas are where the game goes from an explosive action flick to a gritty neo-noir with hours worth of sidequests and aimless exploring. For me, this is what makes Deus Ex so great. It plays off of the best characteristics or all the pieces that put it together. The soundtrack can easily switch from a fast-paced electronic beat to a faint ambiance to fit each level specifically. which perfectly coincides with combat. In one level you'll be mowing down every NSF soldier you see with a Sawed-Off, and the next you'll be methodically weaving between buildings, hiding from cameras and deciding to silently take down that group of enemies or avoid them all together. The game reinforces this shift between styles with the limited amount of items you can find. Instead of holding you back from entering an area in the game meant for later, it'll slightly nudge you away by guarding it with really tough enemies, or locking the door with a numpad that takes 4 tools to open. It's the small elements that were taken account with the level design in mind, especially with the hubs that elevate the game so much. While the story starts to sound like the focus group were a bunch of tinfoil-hatted conspiracy theorists, it's all explained so well and in great detail that makes it seem more ""realistic"". There's constantly data being thrown at you that it can be hard to absorb, but it creates a scale that really isn't realized until you pay more attention to it. Reading datacubes on tables or emails on a computer will give more insight into what's going on around you, and more importantly the people involved. Characters you liked early on might become more despicable, or vice-versa depending on how much you know about them from those optional little bits of character development that are placed throughout the game. Hell, this review is just another paper thrown into a file cabinet, but it's more of a personal love letter to the expirience I've had with Deus Ex over the course of my life. It seems every 3 or so years after I haven't played it in a while I'll reinstall it and sink another 50 hours into, and those little things I find that I didn't notice when I was a kid 10 years ago will put a huge smile on my face. It's by no means a perfect game, and it's not the first game to mix different genres in a very similar way (see System Shock), but it's a game that has to be expirienced first hand to know just how great it is.

												   This game...playing this game, I can see why it earned the title ""Game of the Year"". After playing this game from start to finish (40 Freakin Hours mind you), I can say that I was surprised and interested at the story, the cast of characters, the gameplay, and the music. Deus Ex is one of those games that allows you to do whatever you want. You can either play the game as John Rambo and kill every single enemy in your way, or you can play the game as Snake and take out enemies stealthily. It craves for you to get immersed into the complex story and make some pretty story-altering decisions. This game is an FPS game but there is an RPG element to it as well since you can upgrade your abilities or ""augmentations"" as the game calls it. The atmosphere of the game is apparent as you hear the music and face multiple adversaries. Overall, this game caught me off guard with the amount of content that it has in store for you, the player.    Let's get into the positives of the game first. Even though this is a 2000 game and the graphics may not look appealing, the positives of the game overcompensate it. In this cyberpunk and futuristic world of Deus Ex, you play a new agent of an organization (called UNATCO) named JC Denton. You will find that JC and the various people throughout this universe are ""augmented"", meaning that they are combined by the powers of nanotechnology. He has a brother named Paul Denton, and both of you are taught that you are a part of UNATCO, the organization that brings peace to the world of 2050! Even though JC and Paul are trained in combat and have massive amounts of knowledge on the world of Deus Ex, they do not know one thing: their past. Without spoiling the game, the truth hits them right in the face and they are forced to trust their instincts and make some risky decisions. The story of the game is complex, for there are many characters, many organizations to explore, and many twists to understand. The game gives you options that can make you make your own story in the game and this becomes extremely critical when you have to decide between three different resolutions for the end of the game.   The gameplay of Deus Ex is a lot of combinations. Like I said, you can play the game as Snake and stealthily kill people with your silenced weapons. Or you can play the game as John Rambo and explode people with your GEP gun (You'll know what that is later when you play this amazing game!). NOT ONLY that, but also there are other features such as the ability to hack terminals and computers. Since this is a highly technological world, JC can hack in order to bypass security, obtain key iinformation, and use the turrets and robots to his advantage (If you have the upgrade for it!). There's also a lockpicking mechanism, where JC can automatically open a locked box or chest with one or more lockpicks. You can get essential items by doing this. You can also use melee weapons, assult rifles, shotguns, explosives, pistols and so on! One unique thing is that you can use your augmented powers that you gained. For example, you can super-sprint or you can soak bullet damage! Be careful not to rely on this too much because this uses your energy!!! So as you can see, the gameplay has a lot of factors into it.    The atmosphere of the game is apparent and unqiue. The music is pretty catchy with its electronica influences and it fits with the different and various locals the game has to offer. The developers actually took the time to simulate realisitic email discussions that you can read if you hack or login to a computer. Also, there are ""datacubes"" that you can read if you find them. Although these seem like minor things, it adds a lot to the information-seeking mentality of the game. The characters you meet throughout the stages add to the atmosphere of the game as well. Hell, you get to chat with augmented people, people who are busy clubbin', gang members, and AIs for crying out loud. The developers definitely did a great job establishing the futuristic atmosphere of the game.   Now that I pretty much said the positives, let's go into the negatives. For one thing, Deus Ex has a weird way of saving data. If you don't know how Deus Ex works, YOU WILL lose hours of content. I'm not even exaggerating.  In this game, DO NOT EXPECT AUTOMATIC CHECKPOINTS, YOU MAKE YOUR OWN CHECKPOINTS!  There is none of the typical checkpoint system we see in most games. For this game, you can save anytime you want and you can make multiple save files if you want. This took time for me to get used to but this is still considered a bit of a negative in my book. Another negative is the inventory system of the game. There are times where I wanted a specific gun but it couldn't fit in my inventory. Deus Ex's inventory system is similar to the Resident Evil 4 inventory system, where everything is based on block space. So if you don't have any more blocks, you don't have service. I don't know but it feels like inventory space fills pretty quickly, especially when you get more than 4 guns or more. The explosive guns take up way too much inventory space and I rarely use them as a result. One last negative is that the AI (I'm talking about the enemy AI not the AIs featured in the game!) are stupid at times. Sometimes they run past you and sometimes, they kill themselves.   Overall, Deus Ex is amazing when it comes to the complex and immersing story, the multiple-sided gameplay, and the unique atmosphere. Some negatives include a weird way to save the game, inventory space problems, and derpy enemy AI. I'm glad I bought this game when it was on sale and this game is definitely worth more than the $4 I paid. If you're looking for a challenge, if you are looking for a unique premise, if you are looking for freedom of choices, then this game is worth trying out.			"

												It seems kind of unfair to review a living legend. Imagine if someone asked you to critique Tetris. What would say? It would be hard not to look at things through rose colored glasses. Luckily, I had only heard that Deus Ex was great when I first picked it up. I wasn't a fanboy, I didn't really care, even though I had played and enjoyed Human Revolution. And when I got my hands on it, oh boy. Everyone was right.Deus Ex is fantastic. Like, the type of fantastic that doesn't exist anymore. Imagine a game that accounts for everything the player can do. Deus Ex is just short of that, and only fails to be utterly perfect because it hasn't aged well. There are no autosaves even though there really should be. The voice acting can be horrid. An automatic inventory sort would've been nice. Deus Ex has tiny problems that are really only caused by being a product of a different time. All in all, unlike I a lot of people, I still don't think Deus Ex is the greatest game ever.....(read comments)			"

												I've been meaning to play DE1 for the past few years, given that I have heard so many good things about it, but I was too busy playing other games. Regardless, given the fact that this game is available on Steam (and was only about $5 when I bought it, can't beat such a deal), I decided that it's finally time to give it a try. And so I did, being extremely impressed with the game. My knowledge of older (2000 and prior) game titles is limited to MS-DOS games like Wolfenstein 3D, Commander Keen, Doom, Quake, Blake Stone, etc., and as such I didn't play anything like Deus Ex or System Shock, or other important games of this time. I am stating this because I am making it clear that I have absolutely nothing to compare DE1 to. With that said, this really is a phenomenal game. As plenty of other people have said already, the amount of ways to get past a certain mission, being able to do things at your own pace instead of being forced into a linear storyline type of game is quite refreshing. It's not quite an open-world game, but that's completely understandable. The lore of DE1 is unparalleled in video game history, in my opinion. It's the kind of game that comes along once in a lifetime, blows everyone and their mother away in sheer disbelief, and is never matched in overall quality (at least in its genre, though one can argue that it has its own genre, again making it unsuitable for comparison to other games).The bottom line is that I really can't find anything wrong with this game. I waited way too long to play it, but it's better late than never. Others have claimed that it would probably be more enjoyable to have played DE1 in its prime (the year 2000 where there was little or no competition in that regard), but as I've already said, this game hasn't quite been surpassed by anything. Therefore, I don't believe that it makes a difference whether you play this game in its heyday or (almost) 15 years later. This is a highly excellent game that I'll recommend to anyone, and the fact that it runs on very much any computer made in the last ten years (even netbooks), makes it even more accessible. 5 out of 5 stars for this game.

												An exquisite, futuristic,  sci-fi masterpiece. So many titles that fall by the wayside never standing the test of time, yet Deus Ex remains over the ash heap of long forgotten games.To me what made this game so appealing is the universe in which it exists. A future that could easily be our own with the technology, conspiracy theories and similar named global powers that have had an effect on the real world we experience today.  Often if you took the time within the game to read information about current events happening and the parallels between our worlds it often seemed prophetic. That makes this game all the more intriguing and a satisfying experience. Character interactions also shaped the way you approach the game throughout. Do I try to talk my way out? Do I try to sneak in to accomplish my objective or go in guns blazing? Depending on the type of playstyle you want, you could distibute your skills and augmentations in specific ways so that your enemies would barely know you were there and if they did, it would be too late.Such an awesome game..I would definitely recommend this game to fans who love a futuristic, dystopian, and cyberpunk universe. You will not be disappointed.			"

												For as dated as a game this is, BUY. IT. NOW.Firstly, the combat is not very good. But who even goes out and releases fire in a game like this? If you want to do that, then play DOOM. (My all time favorite game.) It's even more fun to play it stealthily. Yes, the AI is dumb and will do the whole ""HUH? I HEARD SOMETHING."" thing. But at least when one guy detects you, it's only them and not every other person in the room, their wives, their children, their pets, the grandchildren, Kermit the Frog, etc. (Unless he presses that dang alarm.)Also, the RPG elements play a good role in the game. When you learn how to use a pistol better, you don't get crap like just plain higher damage. You actually get stuff that would make sense, like faster reloading and quicker aiming down.The story is great. I won't leave any spoilers, but it left me leaning forward in my chair.For the graphics, you can fix them with the HD mods and such. Also, make sure to fix the framerate issues in those mods by putting on VSync and such.But the one thing that I will say is somewhat critical to this game, is the voice acting. ""MISTAH JAY SEAH DENTAWN. IN DA FRESH. AS DAHK AND SEWIOUS AS ID BRUDDAH.""So, I'd say it's a 9/10, despite how aged and flawed it is. Just buy it. BUY IT. It's one of my favorites.

												Exceptionally great game. When the first level of the game has like 5 different ways to approach it, is filled with multiple secrets and npc dialogue, you know you got a great game. The variety of how you want to do each level is astounding. You can go loud and lethal and kill everything in site (including your allies), or you can do what I did and take the stealth/non-lethal approach and just knock everyone out. You can literally beat the entire game without killing a single person. Hell, some levels you can avoid interaction with other units entirely. You can just stealth your way through. Weapon variety is good, but what makes it unique is that some weapons have multiple ammo types allowing for interesting diversity. Really fun stuff. Just all around awesome game with tons of replay value and a plethora of content for the price. Still holds up today and is generally better than most games out right now. And just for the record, to those saying that the voice acting can be racist. That's not true. Accents are based on nationality, not race. Chinese, German and Russian are not races, they are nationalities. So saying it's racist to have someone with a crappy, stereotypical German or Chinese accent is just plain wrong.  It's like saying someone doing a New York accent is racist, when New Yorkers aren't a race. :P			"

												What can I say? One of the best titles ever made. There are mods available to modernize the game, but I'm quite happy to play this as is. I try to play this once a year and it hits the spot every time. Sadly no one plays the MP, but its negligible in comparison to the engrossing single player campaign. If you've never picked this up, I encourage you to do so (it's generally less than $2 during sale time). Make sure you relax when you get to Hong Kong.			"

There's a reason this game's called the best game ever created15 years ago, this game came out. (Happy birthday Deus Ex)It's heeded as the best game ever for a reason. It's not because the gunplay is fantastic or because it's ""The Next Big CoD Rival""CoD was this game's rival and still is.The story's foundation are actual conspiracies from the 90's and 2000's, which is part of what made it amazing. To tell the other parts would spoil it.The characters, while having bad voice acting, were some of the most alive characters in any videogame. The characters displayed real emotion, and their characteristics affected how they acted and how they viewed your actions.The levels are pretty expansive, and offer multiple solutions to a problem that aren't obvious. From the streets of NYC to underground laboratories and military airfields, this game has plenty of environments of all shapes and sizes.The music is a part of what makes the game legendary. The game has set music for each level/area of the game, and all the music sets the mood extremely well. Each track has different scores based on what's happening in-game.The gameplay itself is also amazing, but clunky. The stealth is pretty nice, and the weapons and tools you have at disposal offer many different ways to approach and deal with a problem. Inventory management is big too, and makes you decide whether you want to dedicate yourself to big weapons with little room for more, or small weapons with multiple tools to use. When you navigate a level, you aren't told what to do. There is no waypoint or minimap. You're given, usually, a map of the area you're in, markers on that map, a compass, and you set off exploring the world yourself, getting clues and information on your objective as you explore.The skills and augmentations also play a big role in gameplay. Before you start a game, you are shown a skills screen. You can upgrade or downgrade skills at the start to fir the playstyle you want to start building on, whether it be based around stealth, gunplay, or both, it's possible. Augmentations are gained through the collection of Augmentation Canisters. You can find these throughout the game, and each canister has 2 different augmentations. Once you install an augmentation for each body part, you cannot remove it. Through the use of Augmentation Upgrade Canisters, these can be improved, and some body parts have more than one slot (2 or 3), so you can have plenty of different augmentations to choose from and use.TL;DRPros:Amazing musicAmazing level designsCharacters full of lifeHuge range of character customizationGreat storyLarge amount of world interactivityCons:Clunky gameplayMessy graphics (Although fairly good for a game from 2000)Voice acting isn't exactly good, pretty bad at some pointsUnoptimized for modern machines (Not heavily, but some things can fix the little things wrong with the game. Get Deus Exe to fix some of these: http://kentie.net/article/dxguide/)Just buy the game already.			"

												Deus Ex! A Nanopunk/Cyberpunk themed action role playing game, combining first person shooter, stealth and role playing elements.Developed by ION Storm and Published by Eidos Interactive/SQUARE ENIX and designed by Warren Spector and Harvey Smith.Set in a dystopian world druing the year 2052 the plot follows UNATCO Agent JC Denton to combat terrorist forces. As the plot thickens Denton becomes entangled in a dark and deep ancient conspiracy.A game that has received universal acclaim and recieved multiple awards!The games storyline is unmatched by any other, the blending of genres: Role-playing, FPS, Adventure and Immersive Simulation makes this game the greatest of all time. Touches a lot on world affairs and it really takes a hold of you throwing you into dark and deep government conspiraciesGood:-The story is truly amazing it will overpower you!-The gameplay incoporates four genres and it blends together perfectly-Expansive environments with a lot of exploration.-Dialogue and back story improves the overall experience and there are some funny and cheesy one liners from NPCs.-RPG Elements are designed very well-The soundtrack of Deus Ex is flawless! The music really adds to the experience and the atmosphere, with subtle ambient street music to blasting bass/electronic tracks in combat.-Highly replayable I have played through at least 10 times.-The games graphics although not amazing really add to the atmosphere of a dark world which really puts Deus Ex into context.Bad:-Nothing, this game is flawless.There will never be a game in my heart that will replace this masterpiece of a game!Worth the experience, worth the penny, worth playing at least ten times!10 Foxes out of 10 Foxes :D			"

												This is probably the best FPS of all time. The story is fantastic, and the game plays almost like an RPG with how you level up your character's skills and abilities. The game is also extremely long. It will probably take you 20 hours just to get through it once. The levels are all large and almost sandbox like, with tons of places to explore outside just the mission you are trying to do. The people in the world can also converse with you and give you interesting information. The game supports multiple play styles (Stealth, run and gun, melee), making each experience and playthrough different. It also has several choices that affect what happens, and three different endings. It's simply a masterpiece. Buy it if you don't have it already. If you do have it, play it right now.			"

												It actually suprised me that this game is over 15 years old. Theres just so much content, multiple ending, choices that affect your world, actually good voice acting, and mechanics that, while are a bit clunkey, aren't the worst. Even the graphics look good from a game of that time. Would definitely recommend to anyone who loves oldschool games and rpgs in general, this is one of the best. There is a problem with this game running too fast on modern computers(dialogue finished before actually done, player moves too fast, etc.) and a problem with low fps, but check the community hub for discussions about it, there are many good mods to fix this.9/10			"

												Hands done one of the greatest FPS/RPG mixes of all time, as well as one of the best overall games of all time. Two things make this game especially good: the story and the gameplay. The augmentations that you use to add new abilites really drastically change the ways you can approach situations instead of just adding passive bonuses like most perk-like systems in so many other RPGs. Each problem you encounter has a dozen ways of solving it and can be solved by any type of character build, so each player can play through the game in their own unique style. Combat has this aspect as well, as you level up your skills with different weapon types, so you can play as a sharpshooting sniper or a rocket-launcher weilding maniac. Without having to explain every game mechanic, all you need to know is that the gameplay is deep, complex, and can be enjoyed basically however you want.While the actual plot line isn't the best, it's the underlying themes that really make it stand out. Not a lot of games ask the types of questions that Deus Ex asks. How much control should the government have on the people? If people were left to govern themselves, would the good side of humanity win over the evil side, or is man's hunger for power and control too great? What does it mean to be human? Are machines more perfect than man? It's a very philosophical game, and it's great to see different, distinct endings that aren't black-and-white in their morality, they all present different governing philosophies, and it's up to the player to decide which they think is the best as they play through the game.The only drawbacks to the game are the awful voice acting, dodgy engine and the shoddy graphics. However, if you're going to prevent yourself from playing this game because of the poor graphics (even for 2000) and the engine hiccups, your really shouldn't. Particularly with this game as it's rightfully a classic and should be played by anybody who enjoys RPG's, FPS's, or both.			"

												   This game...playing this game, I can see why it earned the title ""Game of the Year"". After playing this game from start to finish (40 Freakin Hours mind you), I can say that I was surprised and interested at the story, the cast of characters, the gameplay, and the music. Deus Ex is one of those games that allows you to do whatever you want. You can either play the game as John Rambo and kill every single enemy in your way, or you can play the game as Snake and take out enemies stealthily. It craves for you to get immersed into the complex story and make some pretty story-altering decisions. This game is an FPS game but there is an RPG element to it as well since you can upgrade your abilities or ""augmentations"" as the game calls it. The atmosphere of the game is apparent as you hear the music and face multiple adversaries. Overall, this game caught me off guard with the amount of content that it has in store for you, the player.    Let's get into the positives of the game first. Even though this is a 2000 game and the graphics may not look appealing, the positives of the game overcompensate it. In this cyberpunk and futuristic world of Deus Ex, you play a new agent of an organization (called UNATCO) named JC Denton. You will find that JC and the various people throughout this universe are ""augmented"", meaning that they are combined by the powers of nanotechnology. He has a brother named Paul Denton, and both of you are taught that you are a part of UNATCO, the organization that brings peace to the world of 2050! Even though JC and Paul are trained in combat and have massive amounts of knowledge on the world of Deus Ex, they do not know one thing: their past. Without spoiling the game, the truth hits them right in the face and they are forced to trust their instincts and make some risky decisions. The story of the game is complex, for there are many characters, many organizations to explore, and many twists to understand. The game gives you options that can make you make your own story in the game and this becomes extremely critical when you have to decide between three different resolutions for the end of the game.   The gameplay of Deus Ex is a lot of combinations. Like I said, you can play the game as Snake and stealthily kill people with your silenced weapons. Or you can play the game as John Rambo and explode people with your GEP gun (You'll know what that is later when you play this amazing game!). NOT ONLY that, but also there are other features such as the ability to hack terminals and computers. Since this is a highly technological world, JC can hack in order to bypass security, obtain key iinformation, and use the turrets and robots to his advantage (If you have the upgrade for it!). There's also a lockpicking mechanism, where JC can automatically open a locked box or chest with one or more lockpicks. You can get essential items by doing this. You can also use melee weapons, assult rifles, shotguns, explosives, pistols and so on! One unique thing is that you can use your augmented powers that you gained. For example, you can super-sprint or you can soak bullet damage! Be careful not to rely on this too much because this uses your energy!!! So as you can see, the gameplay has a lot of factors into it.    The atmosphere of the game is apparent and unqiue. The music is pretty catchy with its electronica influences and it fits with the different and various locals the game has to offer. The developers actually took the time to simulate realisitic email discussions that you can read if you hack or login to a computer. Also, there are ""datacubes"" that you can read if you find them. Although these seem like minor things, it adds a lot to the information-seeking mentality of the game. The characters you meet throughout the stages add to the atmosphere of the game as well. Hell, you get to chat with augmented people, people who are busy clubbin', gang members, and AIs for crying out loud. The developers definitely did a great job establishing the futuristic atmosphere of the game.   Now that I pretty much said the positives, let's go into the negatives. For one thing, Deus Ex has a weird way of saving data. If you don't know how Deus Ex works, YOU WILL lose hours of content. I'm not even exaggerating.  In this game, DO NOT EXPECT AUTOMATIC CHECKPOINTS, YOU MAKE YOUR OWN CHECKPOINTS!  There is none of the typical checkpoint system we see in most games. For this game, you can save anytime you want and you can make multiple save files if you want. This took time for me to get used to but this is still considered a bit of a negative in my book. Another negative is the inventory system of the game. There are times where I wanted a specific gun but it couldn't fit in my inventory. Deus Ex's inventory system is similar to the Resident Evil 4 inventory system, where everything is based on block space. So if you don't have any more blocks, you don't have service. I don't know but it feels like inventory space fills pretty quickly, especially when you get more than 4 guns or more. The explosive guns take up way too much inventory space and I rarely use them as a result. One last negative is that the AI (I'm talking about the enemy AI not the AIs featured in the game!) are stupid at times. Sometimes they run past you and sometimes, they kill themselves.   Overall, Deus Ex is amazing when it comes to the complex and immersing story, the multiple-sided gameplay, and the unique atmosphere. Some negatives include a weird way to save the game, inventory space problems, and derpy enemy AI. I'm glad I bought this game when it was on sale and this game is definitely worth more than the $4 I paid. If you're looking for a challenge, if you are looking for a unique premise, if you are looking for freedom of choices, then this game is worth trying out.			"

												If you've never played this game before, I really don't know what to say, because it is extremely old as of this writing (2015) and for that matter, it was technically quite outdated already when it came out in the year 2000 (which the reviews at the time noted with gusto). People who wouldn't have liked it back then most probably wouldn't like it now.But if you can get into old games just fine without having played them when they were new(ish), there really is no other game I can recommend as much as this one - assuming that you have an affinity for FPS/RPG hybrids. It still remains my absolute favorite computer game of all time, but I'll spare you the ""FGR loves Deus Ex"" backstory this time.When it comes to gameplay mods, there are gems like GMDX that make the gameplay feel more modern and competent. Mods like Deus Ex: New Vision and Deus Ex: HDTP enhance the graphics (to ultra-high resolutions in the case of the former), which might make the game more pleasing to some people. And don't forget Deus Ex: Revision, which enhances the map architecture to the limits of Unreal Engine 1.5.Yet for me, while playing the game with ultra-res textures and high-res models is extremely fun, it is only when I play the original game with its outdated graphics and exploitable gameplay functions when I feel right at home.

												I first played Deus Ex when it was released on retail way back in the 2000s. I finished it 3 times and now that I can't find the CD any more, I insist on having Deus Ex in my Steam library. Why the fascination?Because Deus Ex was one of those games that really broke the mold. Along with Thief, this game showed that, hey, maybe an FPS doesn't really have to be about shooting. Maybe an FPS can also be an RPG.Deus Ex gives you guns but lets you sneak around enemies instead. It presents you targets to kill but also lets you pacify them diplomatically. It gives you a dozen options and rewards you for taking any one of them. It's a game that gives you an awesome futuristic world and tells you and, instead of telling you to blow it up, the game lets you immerse yourself in it.During a time where many games were mere mortal shooters, Deus Ex stood out as something divine.

												My first exposure to Deus Ex came with the PS2 port back in high school, and I am happy to say, after a few hours of playing the PC version (with the graphics fix that is very, very necessary if you're planning on playing anything other than a slideshow whenever water's around), that my fondness for the game is not due entirely to my nostalgia goggles. The game is by no means a good-looking piece of software, but the atmosphere is brilliantly realized, and the overall feel of the world is absolutely masterfully done. You will certainly want to rebind the controls (especially F12 (which is your flashlight by default) unless you've already changed the Steam screenshot keybind), and it might take a bit of time to get back into the turn-of-the-century control scheme, but this game is well worth revisiting, or visiting for the first time.Rarely does a game feel this cohesive.

												So, I finally decided to play this highly critically and publicly acclaimed game. I´ve installed the high-res mod ( very important IMHO) and started playing.  I was surprised how the game and mechanics are well driven and executed (vs the animation - horrible, but hey, this game is 14 years old!), but what is the most incredible thing on this game are your decisions and their affection on the whole story and gameplay. You can do basically what you can think of, you can do everything very stealthy or rambo style, you can talk your way through and shoot every single madafaka in the head. Now I see why all the fans of the original Deus Ex loved  Human Revolution, because Human Revolution is a very good sequel and it respects it´s predecessor in every way. Now it all makes sense.  I love the story, I love the gameplay (it´s pretty hard though) and I love to search every single bit of each location. There is a good ""skilltree"", augmentations (that one I screwed up, I´ve chosen some augmentations that I won´t use much) and inventory that doesn´t sucks. I have no idea where I am in the story ( maybe one fourth?), but so far it is very, very good RPG FPS, and I am sure when I will finish it, it will be one of my favorites game of all time, despite the fact that I´ve played it 14 years after it was released :)			"

												Deus Ex is great, and it's awesome you can get it on Steam, but be warned: this game is frustrating. Being stealthy is my favourite path to go in this game, but it is infuriatingly difficult to pull off, even on lower difficulty settings. One false move and you're in a firefight, and you have to load your last save. Playing this game for me was just one big process of Save, Load, Save, Load. I still haven't finished it because of that problem. But not everyone's experience with this will be the same.			"

I can't think of very many games with such good level design, ever. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI does throw a wrench in it, but I was only playing on Normal.

												One of my favorite games of all time. I've played it around the time it came out and multiple times throughout the years and it never gets old. Sure the graphics are outdated now but putting that aside, it's still a fantastic game. The many choices to approach an objective was revolutionary at the time and adds variety to each playthrough. It has a great conspiracy theory type story as well that will draw you in. This is a 10/10 game in my book.			"

												Deus ex is an amazing game with huge amounts of depth and complexitiy. The open ended nature of this game helps create a believable world, and every possiblity that you can do is acounted for, for example you can kill an allied agent when you are ""not supposed to"" and your handler would react. The Story of the game involves basic conspiracy theory tropes, but they presented in a way that makes you ask serious questions, like questioning whether or not society is really connected to government(taken from an readable book from the game).

												This is probably the best FPS of all time. The story is fantastic, and the game plays almost like an RPG with how you level up your character's skills and abilities. The game is also extremely long. It will probably take you 20 hours just to get through it once. The levels are all large and almost sandbox like, with tons of places to explore outside just the mission you are trying to do. The people in the world can also converse with you and give you interesting information. The game supports multiple play styles (Stealth, run and gun, melee), making each experience and playthrough different. It also has several choices that affect what happens, and three different endings. It's simply a masterpiece. Buy it if you don't have it already. If you do have it, play it right now.			"

												I cannot recommend a game more highly than this one. The adage that whenever anyones mentions Deus Ex you have to re-install it is true, and there is a reason for it. The argument that it is simply nostalgia that keeps people playing holds no ground.While the graphics and AI haven't exactly stood the test of time the rest of the game does not pull any punches or treat the player as if they are anything but smart. The story is deep and long and worth telling. The gameplay is RPG told through the first person perspective, and it refelcts accordingly. Your abilities are limited but progress to your desires.The dystopian cyberpunk vibe is both exhilerating and creepy at the same time. The feeling of 'Oh man I hope the future is this cool' is balanced with, 'Could it really get this bad?' This is the best PC game ever.			"

												So, I finally decided to play this highly critically and publicly acclaimed game. I´ve installed the high-res mod ( very important IMHO) and started playing.  I was surprised how the game and mechanics are well driven and executed (vs the animation - horrible, but hey, this game is 14 years old!), but what is the most incredible thing on this game are your decisions and their affection on the whole story and gameplay. You can do basically what you can think of, you can do everything very stealthy or rambo style, you can talk your way through and shoot every single madafaka in the head. Now I see why all the fans of the original Deus Ex loved  Human Revolution, because Human Revolution is a very good sequel and it respects it´s predecessor in every way. Now it all makes sense.  I love the story, I love the gameplay (it´s pretty hard though) and I love to search every single bit of each location. There is a good ""skilltree"", augmentations (that one I screwed up, I´ve chosen some augmentations that I won´t use much) and inventory that doesn´t sucks. I have no idea where I am in the story ( maybe one fourth?), but so far it is very, very good RPG FPS, and I am sure when I will finish it, it will be one of my favorites game of all time, despite the fact that I´ve played it 14 years after it was released :)			"

For 7 bucks, you get one hell of a ride as an international cop in a globe-trekking adventure in a mid-21st century world where millions die from an unknown plague and active civil war in 'stable' Western countries push society closer and closer to the brink. Although certain gameplay elements, in particular AI behavior ('Duh, my buddy five feet away just started yelling about cops and started shooting, let me continue my patrol - oh wait it's that cop!') and graphics date the game somewhat, the story and atmosphere/level design rivals that of more celebrated franchises today.

												A true classic that no one should miss out on, especially if you're a fan of the shooter-RPG type element games. This is one of the few games that I beat repeatedly, probably 10 times, since it's release. I always enjoy going back once a year or two to play it again, and it always seems like there's something new or something I've missed in each playthrough. This is definitely on my list of top best PC games out there, and truthfully.. this game did more for me than Half-Life did back in the day (although I enjoyed it as well of course). While the graphics may not look great, those who can look past it will find an amazing game with an addictive RPG-shooter style set-up that can be replayed over and over. This is a TRUE classic, and one that shouldn't be missed. And with such a low price (especially considering how big the game is and how much replay value there is), there's just no way to go wrong. So wait no longer, and play Deus Ex. You won't regret it!			"

												Deus Ex really surprised me, in a good way. I underrated this phenomenal stealth-shooter-RPG hybrid at first, because of the terrible graphics and sound.You play as a cyborg in the future that gets wrapped up in the shadow government when agencies try to seize all government power. The story is built from conspiracy theories. It's ultimately pretty simple, but it works and gives the world an interesting feel.For each problem in Deus Ex, there are many ways to solve it, and many ways to build your character to take advantage of them. You can gun down enemy bases soldier by soldier, or use non-lethal force to sneak in and out with no casualties. There are many viable options, and this is where the game really shines.However, the graphics are horrible (even for its time), most of the music isn't very good, and the voice acting is hilariously bad.I got this really cheap, and I've loved it. I've probably spent a good 40 hours on it, and I can definitely recommend it.			"

												This game, guys. This game. Those screenshots up there? Yeah, that's how dated the graphics are. It was released in 2000. The gameplay, on the other hand, is a standard-setter for the RPGFPS genre. Never played Deus Ex? This is your chance. Get ready to be tactical about your entrances. Plan it out a little before you fire off a shot, or don't shoot at all. You can be stealthy! You can hack that door! You can bash that other one down and shoot people! The Deus Ex series' level design alone sets a standard. Sure, you have exact goals to get to. You have about a dozen ways to get to each one, however, and the harder you have to look, the better it generally is for your health bar.The weapon spread is realistic. Didn't put any points into using that kind of gun? You're going to have to stand there for a while to be able to land your shot, or you'll miss the broad side of a barn in broad daylight. Put ALL of your points into using that kind of gun? Give it about one second. Yep, headshot. I will admit. There is no recharge for your augments' energy supply, nor is there any health regen. You have to find items to recharge your energy, and medkits for your health. But that's part of the charm of these old shooters. You don't just sit there patiently and undo all of your mistakes. You play through it right. Not all that hard to do so, though, they do have some pretty darned easy difficulty settings and a quicksave button. The dialogue is not this game's strong point. Oh well. The story itself is good regardless. The optional objectives, as is the norm for Deus Ex, are highly rewarding to carry out. <spoiler redacted> to complete the optional objective in the first mission and you'll see how lucrative it can be. On a scale of six to potato, this game is... Y2K Standards Raiser. And at the time I'm writing this, it's seven dollars. The campaign will take you a lot longer to beat than I've put into it. It's worth the seven dollars. Did I mention there's an incredible number of mods for it? No? Damn. Best part. There's mods for it.			"

The pacing seemed slow, and the lack of ammo just wasn't fun for me...   I was playing like a shooter.Fast forward to 2013.  I decided to play this after getting it in a Deus Ex bundle,  and holy crap I was surprised.  The game I remembered was a clunky shooter with crappy guns... ( Honestly, I felt the same way about Mass Effect when it first came out.  )  I see now that it's an inteligent rpg with an action mask.   I was rewarded for being cautious, investing skill points in non-combat abilities, and using non-lethal approaches.  Also, the story is actually good~ "

												Deus Ex has an excellent story with unique gameplay. It's a combination of splinter cell and half life with RPG elements. Edios integrates all these elements into one game perfectly. This game was done so well that you can take different approaches in a combat scenario and you'll encounter the same difficulty in each approach.  Those who enjoy RPGs and games that aren't necessarily action packed will find this game very appealing. Anyone who enjoys RPG's should at least give this game a shot. It can be one of the most thrilling gaming experiences ever.Gameplay: 18/20 ...

												Definitely one of the best games out there. You can easily get immerssed in this RPG/FPS. This game opened the door to many games we know today, such as Fallout 3 and Borderlands, with it's cutimizable character, stats, scenarios and story.The setting is dark and feels influenced by the X-Files. The locations compliment it's story, with the dark tunnels and night missions, you get a feel for a world that is doomed and falling apart. Very good characters, music, and dialog.Recommended for those who're looking for a great story and atmosphere.			"

It's also a fantastic stealth game where you can knock out your enemies with a baton, electrocute them or use a dart gun. And the plot! The plot is entertaining with various backstories and conspiracies.There are so many ways to beat the game and get through the sprawling environments.

												Ignore the cheesy cutscene at the start. Ignore the awful graphics, the dodgy AI, the bugs - just bear with it for the first hour. The first few missions are basically tutorials; a prologue establishing the atmosphere, the sense that you're merely a pawn in a larger conflict, and how you want to play the game. Then, the twist comes and your thrust into a world of conspiracy, corruption, and moral ambiguity. The huge levels and the amount of choices available makes 'Deus Ex' exceptionally replayable also. You may be surprised to find that there are many sandbox elements. There are many areas with large volumes of NPC's who can be toyed with, as well as many hidden nooks and crannies. Exploration will usually reward you with additional story, rare items, or both. Regrettably, these areas only show up after the first mission. Once you get used to the combat, you'll find it smooth. The abundance of open areas means sniping is possibly the most rewarding option of the game. But there are also flamethrowers, rocket-launchers, grenades that can be turned into mines, plasma-rifles, assault-rifles that can also throw bombs, and a LIGHTSABER (well, it's not called that...but it totally is) Plus you can apply upgrades that turn you invisible, regenerate your health, lift heavy objects, see though walls, deploy a remote-controlled missile, and can make you jump like your in 'The Matrix.' Of course, 'Deus Ex' is at heart a roleplaying game - even though it has plenty of FPS and stealth elements. Unlike 'System Shock 2,' you can pick up any weapon and use it...but you'll be terrible. You'll move like a drunkard if you pick up a rocket launcher untrained, you'll aim like a drunkard if you try sniping, and you'll hit like a drunkard if you try melee. But you can still pick them up in an emergency. (The only thing you can't do untrained is hack computers.)'Deus Ex' is bugged, but whilst it may sound odd, it's bugged in a quirky way that only breaks the immersion if you want it to. You can use mines to climb up buildings to reach places your not supposed to get to until later - which often causes NPC's to completely freak out. You can cheat during boss-battles by setting mine-traps, throwing TNT at them mid-conversation, or just running past them. Enemies won't attack you whilst  in the shower out of politeness, and Paris nightclub guards won't care if you murder someone before their very eyes. Finally, you can get the entire Anti-Terrorism squad to attack a vaccum-cleaner. My advice is play the game straight first time, then spend every playthrough afterwards trying to see how you can turn 'Deus Ex' from serious cyberpunk-thriller into hilarious funland. The recent 'Deus Ex: Human Revolution' is worth your time, but it can't hold a candle to it's grandfather. Whilst it might seem uninuitive and difficult to begin with: stay with it. You will be rewarded with one of the best games ever made.			"

												This game is so freaking great! I cannot stress enough how much I love this game! However, let me try.Deus Ex is full of wonderful dialouge, multiple approaches to combat, and situations that literally left me short of breath. The pacing is perfect, with the more political segments unraveling at just the right moments to make you question everything, and the fights making your heart race. I played this game first on the PS2, where it was called Deus Ex: Conspiracy Theory, and it was one of the first games to make me think about my beliefs. I questioned a lot of things after playing certain parts of this game. And I love it for that. It's not just a shooter. It's not just an action game. It's beyond that.I highly recommend this game if you want a fun, tricky, compelling game that will not just stay in the background. It jumps out at you and grabs your brain. Be prepared.			"

												Not since I played Bioshock 2 have I experienced such a game as this. There's so many things this game does right that I can't list them all, but I'll go over the highlights:- Fantastic music that really matches (and enhances!) the atmosphere of the game- Awesome level design- RPG type ""augmentations"" that are straightforward enough to allow the player to make intellegent choices on their playstyle, as well as actually being useful- Choices everywhere. For example, it is possible to play through the whole game without killing anyone (by the use of glitches, although that's not too hard). There are also so many different ways of doing things like opening doors, fighting enemies, talking to people, script breaking, etc. Lots of replayability!Just buy the game. BUY IT.TEN OUTA TEN			"

												If you haven't played Deus Ex, don't play the new one. I mean, play the new one. Just play this first. You can skip part dieux.DX is an RPFPS, and really pretty much the best one there is, even to this day. The controls are good, the voice acting is really quite good for the time, and the graphics are still passable (at the time they were so good that this game came with my 3D Prophet 2 Ultra).As far as gameplay, I have no complaints. This game is so open-ended that you can figure things out accidentally without finding the clues that are meant to help you solve the puzzles. Don't know the access code? Go ahead and brute force that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥; You'll hit it eventually.That made me remember my one complaint: no journal. You need a notebook with you to write down clues and access codes. Or an eidetic memory. That could also work.Anyway. Deus Ex gets a solid A from me.			"

												The game that made me question my country and government. (lol)If you can get past the old graphics (Which I frankly love), I'd say give this a shot.The game is set up around real-world governement conspiracy theories, which makes it all the more interesting, about groups like MJ-12, the Illuminati, etc and how the play their ""secret hand"" in the decisons that are ultimately made by all governments. It even goes deep with rumors as to what is actually happening at Area 51 based off of what has been found so far by the populace and leaked.The combat style is old school (Game is from like 2000, don't expect stuff from Metro etc.) and the AI can be pretty funny at times, not to mention the voice acting on some of the forign charecters will make you laugh to no extent, but thats since they used who produced it to do the voice acting since they didn't have enough to hire etc. And it does take some getting use to, you have your skills. (Heavy Weps, Small Arms, Knives, Hacking/Computers, Swimming etc) and you level them up by spending points you get for progression through the games storyline and by completing side missions and finding little secret areas in game. accuracy is debated by how long you let the reticle focus in on your crosshair, if its far from it, you will likely miss, as to the oppisite, you'll hit directly where you're looking at. Higher your skill with that said wep, faster it closes in for that accurate shot.You can mod your weapons, and this has the oh so great augmentation of your char. (Such as cloak, spybot, Aqualung, Ballistic Shield etc) to make you be able to play this silent in the shadows, or the brute who goes out blasting (If you try to be the brute against bots.. Well, I'll let you learn yourself. Same with commandos :)  )This game is linear, to a point. But the enviroments are huge, with lots of hidden secrets. What you do drastically changes others views on you, and how the story progresses. Some events happen no matter what, but most can be changed and affected by you.My opinion? A must play. The story in this is comparable to none in terms of depth, immersion, and wanting you to re-play to see what would've happened if you chose a different solution. I can't tell you how many times I've replayed this since honestly I lost count. This game never ceases to bore me, I somehow always get sucked in to it because of the amazing stories in it. The combat though not sounding exciting, fits this game very well. It takes getting use to, but it is very damn fun.Oh, fun fact. Example of some of the insane weapons in this game: A grenade that turns robots AI against their opponents. This effect persist throughout that whole level, HR it did not. You can also hack terminals and turn turrets onto your side as well. Very, very fun for setting up traps or making a group of people just go cray from their turret randomly opening fire on them. xDOh, also. This beats Human Revolution by far.. I enjoyed it, but this is soo much better. You may not think so, but the story and gameplay in this (FOR ITS TIME) was too damn good to ignore. HR's is predictable and not really dependent on choice, instead of the illusion that you have an impact on the actual ending.. this doesn't have the illusion, it impacts.Must try, you won't regret it.

												Possibly my favourite game of all time. An incredibly deep, immersive FPS/RPG with a rich story, memorable characters and an amazing variation on playstyles. I have completed this game so many times I have lost count, yet each time I discover something new that I hadn't seen before. The games dialogue reacts to everything you do, whether you kill people on sight or simply knock them out, whether you remain hidden or run out in plain view, obey orders or find your own way, how much exploring you do, how much you interact with others. Each time changing the dialogue and story in subtle ways. It's stealth system was one of the most robust for it's day, very much focussing on sticking to the shadows and staying low behind cover. However you may decide to become a literally bulletproof death machine, wielding rifles, swords, rocket launchers and more with equal ferocity.Definitely worth the purchase. A classic game with a mature, well researched story on the possible future.			"

The pacing seemed slow, and the lack of ammo just wasn't fun for me...   I was playing like a shooter.Fast forward to 2013.  I decided to play this after getting it in a Deus Ex bundle,  and holy crap I was surprised.  The game I remembered was a clunky shooter with crappy guns... ( Honestly, I felt the same way about Mass Effect when it first came out.  )  I see now that it's an inteligent rpg with an action mask.   I was rewarded for being cautious, investing skill points in non-combat abilities, and using non-lethal approaches.  Also, the story is actually good~ "

												Deus Ex has an excellent story with unique gameplay. It's a combination of splinter cell and half life with RPG elements. Edios integrates all these elements into one game perfectly. This game was done so well that you can take different approaches in a combat scenario and you'll encounter the same difficulty in each approach.  Those who enjoy RPGs and games that aren't necessarily action packed will find this game very appealing. Anyone who enjoys RPG's should at least give this game a shot. It can be one of the most thrilling gaming experiences ever.Gameplay: 18/20 ...

Compare DE's blueprints and compass with DE3's great big *%£$ destination arrow. The fact everything isn't over simplified and handed to you on a plate makes success in DE a far more satisfying affair than it's more pretty but shallow and obnoxious sequels.The graphics are old and the game can be glitchy, but this does not take away from this real masterpiece of a computer game.

Deus Ex is a tour de force that flawlessly combines deep and involving RPG elements with classic 90's style FPS gameplay. A must have in every PC gamers collection.			"

												Most modern games hold your hand. They say, ""Oh what's wrong? Can't find the boss key? That's all right, we'll skip this one. No, you did nothing wrong. Here's a puppy. It comes with a skirt."" Not Deus Ex. This game gives you a picture of your hit, a map of London, takes all of your ammo, and kicks you into the middle of a warzone in France. Play this game if you've got the grapes.			"

												Not since I played Bioshock 2 have I experienced such a game as this. There's so many things this game does right that I can't list them all, but I'll go over the highlights:- Fantastic music that really matches (and enhances!) the atmosphere of the game- Awesome level design- RPG type ""augmentations"" that are straightforward enough to allow the player to make intellegent choices on their playstyle, as well as actually being useful- Choices everywhere. For example, it is possible to play through the whole game without killing anyone (by the use of glitches, although that's not too hard). There are also so many different ways of doing things like opening doors, fighting enemies, talking to people, script breaking, etc. Lots of replayability!Just buy the game. BUY IT.TEN OUTA TEN			"

												This game feels like playing a cyberified Thief: The Dark Project (which is the best video game ever, in case you didn't know).It has similarly expansive levels, where you can choose your own routes and there are plenty of neat things to discover.It has the same open-ended gameplay: you can sneak around and take moments to take down a guard unnoticed, or you can go in guns blazing when your careful plan of infiltration gets foiled.Yes, it also has the same stupid AI and ugly graphics, but the creative level design and the sheer 'immersiveness' of the game makes you forget about them in a few hours.There are some rpg elements thrown into the mix as well (like dialogue trees, different skills to learn or customisable cyberware), which are always fun to play around with.So what are you waiting for?

New players will find the graphics dated and the gunpay horrendous, but everyone should really give this game a chance as the game sucks you in to its story, world, and missions with ease.  Multiple endings, mid-story event changes, every object can be picked up, stealth is viable and fun, robots, guns, conspiracies, and so much more.  Try it![GET ASAP]			"

												It's very hard to not recommend Deus Ex, it came from a time when the RPG genre was at it's strongest and nearly beat em' all, it was completely unrivaled in terms of gameplay and depth until Morrowind stepped into the ring and took it's belt. It is still to this day one of the best games ever made, but sadly hasn't been given the time and attention that it deserves by the community, and is still very dated despite what mods you install. The quality of the game however will force anyone with a fully functional brain to quickly forget about the awful graphics. If you want the best RPG of all time, and swords/magic aren't your thing, Deus Ex is more than a worthy second place.9/10			"

												Deus Ex was only supposed to be a great FPS, but it also turned out to be a great RPG title with unique dialog and character interactivity. But wait! There's more! It's also a fantastic stealth game where you can knock out your enemies with a baton, electrocute them or use a dart gun. And the plot! The plot is entertaining with various backstories and conspiracies.There are so many ways to beat the game and get through the sprawling environments. It's also a game of epic scope for travelling across the globe, from NYC, to Hong Kong, to Paris and parts of Southern California. JC Denton will also go down as one of the most badass protagonists in video game hisotry.9.3/10			"

												The original great immersive rpg game with a fantastic story. The entire world is dangerous. Its easy to die, but easy to live to. And the range of interactions with the world, simply fantastic. Choices are also less linear than most present day rpgs. I remember being shocked when i realised that some characters did not ""have"" to die if you manged to save them (often a difficult task), or you did not ""have"" to kill them, and whether they did or not changed the future plotting (and to a decent degree by todays standards).To date, only Witcher II offers greater plot choice pathing than Deus Ex. And to date only Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines managed to improve on the social interaction aspect and character development. Sure some of you are going to say bioware, blah blah, and they do do a good job, but its not quite the same when its characters in your own party that are falling all over themselves with development, and yet that development often has little or no impact on the overall plot. I prefer the NPC's (who are the obstacles or aid to the plot) to be the developed ones. And you will find this in Deus Ex.This game still remains one of the best, despite the dated graphics and dated 1st person persepctive (We all know the camera from just behind is the best view so you can actually see all the cool gear, and cool moves that your character does :)			"

												Deus Ex is both my favorite game and arguably the greatest PC game of all time. It appears frequently at or near the top of best ever lists by both journalists and the gaming public. It was ranked #1 of the top 100 PC games of all time by PC Gamer, PC gaming's most widely respected publication.These accolades are no surprise when one sees how brilliantly the game succeeds on so many levels. The story is a masterfully crafted, globe-hopping cyberpunk adventure through which the player's character navigates a dystopian future world on a mission to unravel a Gordian Knot of conspiracies, secrets and lies. Both the player's character and the world he inhabits are shaped by nanotechnology, the former for better, the latter for worse. The player assumes the role of JC Denton, an agent of UNATCO, an international anti-terrorism organization. The terror he combats is largely attributable to the Gray Death, a nanomechanical virus that has ravaged the planet. Denton, however, is immune to the virus thanks to nano-augmentation, a cutting-edge technology available only to elite government agents. Nano-augmentation endows Denton with an array of superhuman powers such as infrared vision and invisibility. Augmentations may be customized to suit a particular playing style, for example stealth artists may opt for the footstep-silencing lower body augmentation while aggressive circle-strafing gunners can choose increased speed. The game's augmentations perfectly complement the open-ended design that is its greatest feature of all. Every level features secret areas for circumventing enemies, gathering intel or finding resources. These avenues might be accessible only with certain abilities, for example a fence might be surmountable only to players with the speed-boosting aug that allows them to leap it or the strength-boosting aug that allows them to stack enough heavy crates to climb it. Every mission can be approached in multiple ways using stealth, force, diplomacy or a combination of the three. The story itself actually adapts to the ramifications of the player's approach to the missions. The game is so open-ended, in fact, that there are only two required neutralizations. It can played as a straight-up run-and-gun shooter, a sneak-through-the-shadows stealth adventure or anywhere in between. Further complementing the open-ended gameplay is the RPG-style stat system in which players can develop proficiency in certain weapons or skills such as hacking, lockpicking, or even swimming. This level of freedom was unprecedented in shooters at the time of the game's release. Before, such games would tell the player  ""Go here, do this."" Deus Ex, through the very end, asks: ""What do you want to do?""Deus Ex is superb in other areas as well: There is a great arsenal of weapons both lethal and non-lethal, familiar and futuristic. A favorite of many is the nano-edged sword, which when combined with footstep silencing aug, is immensely fun to assassinate enemies with. The weaponry is so well-integrated with the augmentation and skill systems that by the end of the game the player feels like a techno-deity. Although the story veers rather outlandish at times, the game never stops encouraging players to think skeptically. The graphics, from an artistic standpoint, convey the game world's bleakness very effectively. The game is set entirely during dusk and nighttime; blues, blacks and grays feature predominantly in its palette. The soundtrack never feels incongruous with its setting and the theme music is one of the most memorable in gaming history.Deus Ex is not a technically perfect game. Its graphics were somewhat dated at the time of release, the foreign accents are hilariously bad and the boss fights are a drag (though all but two are optional). These flaws do not detract, however, from what a monumental achievement this game is. Deus Ex may not be the most technically polished game of all time, but it is among the most influential. Doom and Wolfenstein 3D established the first-person shooter as a genre, but Deus Ex elevated it to an art form. This was accomplished through its ingenious fusion of role-playing elements with familiar shooter conventions, giving birth to a new genre: the action RPG. The action-RPG has become one of today's most popular genres; echoes of Deus Ex can be seen everywhere, from the decision-trees of the Mass Effect trilogy to the plasmids of BioShock.Any game as influential as Deus Ex must be considered a classic, but to call this game a classic is almost an understatement. The defining aspect of video games as a medium is interactivity, and interactivity is maximized when the player is granted as much freedom to shape their role within a game as possible. Deus Ex fostered this freedom to the utmost degree. Deus Ex was not only the instantiation of a new genre, it was and remains to this day, the highest instantiation of what a game can be. "

												Deus Ex! A Nanopunk/Cyberpunk themed action role playing game, combining first person shooter, stealth and role playing elements.Developed by ION Storm and Published by Eidos Interactive/SQUARE ENIX and designed by Warren Spector and Harvey Smith.Set in a dystopian world druing the year 2052 the plot follows UNATCO Agent JC Denton to combat terrorist forces. As the plot thickens Denton becomes entangled in a dark and deep ancient conspiracy.A game that has received universal acclaim and recieved multiple awards!The games storyline is unmatched by any other, the blending of genres: Role-playing, FPS, Adventure and Immersive Simulation makes this game the greatest of all time. Touches a lot on world affairs and it really takes a hold of you throwing you into dark and deep government conspiraciesGood:-The story is truly amazing it will overpower you!-The gameplay incoporates four genres and it blends together perfectly-Expansive environments with a lot of exploration.-Dialogue and back story improves the overall experience and there are some funny and cheesy one liners from NPCs.-RPG Elements are designed very well-The soundtrack of Deus Ex is flawless! The music really adds to the experience and the atmosphere, with subtle ambient street music to blasting bass/electronic tracks in combat.-Highly replayable I have played through at least 10 times.-The games graphics although not amazing really add to the atmosphere of a dark world which really puts Deus Ex into context.Bad:-Nothing, this game is flawless.There will never be a game in my heart that will replace this masterpiece of a game!Worth the experience, worth the penny, worth playing at least ten times!10 Foxes out of 10 Foxes :D			"

The best experience of your lifeThat`s right there the best game ever for PC forever. You can`t go wrong with Deus Ex. No sequel, prequel, clone, inspiration, spiritual successor and whatnot could ever dream to match its supremacy. That is indeed the GOD of games, including every known category and platform.That said, don't ever mod this game. Do not tamper with its currently perfect state. It shall never be rebooted, remastered or re-imagined. Because even those people who did it could ever reproduce the same level of success afterwards. It's like their hands were guided by something else. It is ideal the way it is. Even it's ""flaws"" were imperative in keeping the cohesion of this piece of artwork.I was blessed with the godsend honor and infinite landscapes of joy by playing this game right on its launch date. Had many playthroughs throughout my life since them. And once I start, I cannot focus in anything else until its conclusion. "

												For as dated as a game this is, BUY. IT. NOW.Firstly, the combat is not very good. But who even goes out and releases fire in a game like this? If you want to do that, then play DOOM. (My all time favorite game.) It's even more fun to play it stealthily. Yes, the AI is dumb and will do the whole ""HUH? I HEARD SOMETHING."" thing. But at least when one guy detects you, it's only them and not every other person in the room, their wives, their children, their pets, the grandchildren, Kermit the Frog, etc. (Unless he presses that dang alarm.)Also, the RPG elements play a good role in the game. When you learn how to use a pistol better, you don't get crap like just plain higher damage. You actually get stuff that would make sense, like faster reloading and quicker aiming down.The story is great. I won't leave any spoilers, but it left me leaning forward in my chair.For the graphics, you can fix them with the HD mods and such. Also, make sure to fix the framerate issues in those mods by putting on VSync and such.But the one thing that I will say is somewhat critical to this game, is the voice acting. ""MISTAH JAY SEAH DENTAWN. IN DA FRESH. AS DAHK AND SEWIOUS AS ID BRUDDAH.""So, I'd say it's a 9/10, despite how aged and flawed it is. Just buy it. BUY IT. It's one of my favorites.

												The game that made me into a lover of Cyberpunk, from the (good) team at Ion Storm back in 2000, that brought forth this amazing game, made a landmark in gaming. A Cyberpunk-RPG hybrid that is still to this day, unrivaled by any game in the genre. Deus Ex, is a game that can have you go back through the main story so many times and get so many different outcomes it is insane. The game is a testament to Warren Spector and his team on how games can be made that can stand the test of time regardless of its sub-par graphics by today's standards. The story is incredible, it dives heaviuly into the idea of consparcy theories so much, it is astounding. This is a must have for any gamer to have. Overall: 95/100			"

												Hands done one of the greatest FPS/RPG mixes of all time, as well as one of the best overall games of all time. Two things make this game especially good: the story and the gameplay. The augmentations that you use to add new abilites really drastically change the ways you can approach situations instead of just adding passive bonuses like most perk-like systems in so many other RPGs. Each problem you encounter has a dozen ways of solving it and can be solved by any type of character build, so each player can play through the game in their own unique style. Combat has this aspect as well, as you level up your skills with different weapon types, so you can play as a sharpshooting sniper or a rocket-launcher weilding maniac. Without having to explain every game mechanic, all you need to know is that the gameplay is deep, complex, and can be enjoyed basically however you want.While the actual plot line isn't the best, it's the underlying themes that really make it stand out. Not a lot of games ask the types of questions that Deus Ex asks. How much control should the government have on the people? If people were left to govern themselves, would the good side of humanity win over the evil side, or is man's hunger for power and control too great? What does it mean to be human? Are machines more perfect than man? It's a very philosophical game, and it's great to see different, distinct endings that aren't black-and-white in their morality, they all present different governing philosophies, and it's up to the player to decide which they think is the best as they play through the game.The only drawbacks to the game are the awful voice acting, dodgy engine and the shoddy graphics. However, if you're going to prevent yourself from playing this game because of the poor graphics (even for 2000) and the engine hiccups, your really shouldn't. Particularly with this game as it's rightfully a classic and should be played by anybody who enjoys RPG's, FPS's, or both.			"

Disregarding the pending prequel Deus Ex is still worth a try on it's own merits with the ability to tackle situations in a multitude of ways including stealth, non leathal and guns blazing. All in all Deus Ex is a game that every serious gamer should try at least once, to appreciate where we have come from and to see how far we still have to go.			"

												The game that made me question my country and government. (lol)If you can get past the old graphics (Which I frankly love), I'd say give this a shot.The game is set up around real-world governement conspiracy theories, which makes it all the more interesting, about groups like MJ-12, the Illuminati, etc and how the play their ""secret hand"" in the decisons that are ultimately made by all governments. It even goes deep with rumors as to what is actually happening at Area 51 based off of what has been found so far by the populace and leaked.The combat style is old school (Game is from like 2000, don't expect stuff from Metro etc.) and the AI can be pretty funny at times, not to mention the voice acting on some of the forign charecters will make you laugh to no extent, but thats since they used who produced it to do the voice acting since they didn't have enough to hire etc. And it does take some getting use to, you have your skills. (Heavy Weps, Small Arms, Knives, Hacking/Computers, Swimming etc) and you level them up by spending points you get for progression through the games storyline and by completing side missions and finding little secret areas in game. accuracy is debated by how long you let the reticle focus in on your crosshair, if its far from it, you will likely miss, as to the oppisite, you'll hit directly where you're looking at. Higher your skill with that said wep, faster it closes in for that accurate shot.You can mod your weapons, and this has the oh so great augmentation of your char. (Such as cloak, spybot, Aqualung, Ballistic Shield etc) to make you be able to play this silent in the shadows, or the brute who goes out blasting (If you try to be the brute against bots.. Well, I'll let you learn yourself. Same with commandos :)  )This game is linear, to a point. But the enviroments are huge, with lots of hidden secrets. What you do drastically changes others views on you, and how the story progresses. Some events happen no matter what, but most can be changed and affected by you.My opinion? A must play. The story in this is comparable to none in terms of depth, immersion, and wanting you to re-play to see what would've happened if you chose a different solution. I can't tell you how many times I've replayed this since honestly I lost count. This game never ceases to bore me, I somehow always get sucked in to it because of the amazing stories in it. The combat though not sounding exciting, fits this game very well. It takes getting use to, but it is very damn fun.Oh, fun fact. Example of some of the insane weapons in this game: A grenade that turns robots AI against their opponents. This effect persist throughout that whole level, HR it did not. You can also hack terminals and turn turrets onto your side as well. Very, very fun for setting up traps or making a group of people just go cray from their turret randomly opening fire on them. xDOh, also. This beats Human Revolution by far.. I enjoyed it, but this is soo much better. You may not think so, but the story and gameplay in this (FOR ITS TIME) was too damn good to ignore.

For those of you who don't know, this games first pperson interface predates the interface for Oblivion...  By nearly a decade.  Play this game, you won't be sorry.			"

												I cannot recommend a game more highly than this one. The adage that whenever anyones mentions Deus Ex you have to re-install it is true, and there is a reason for it. The argument that it is simply nostalgia that keeps people playing holds no ground.While the graphics and AI haven't exactly stood the test of time the rest of the game does not pull any punches or treat the player as if they are anything but smart. The story is deep and long and worth telling. The gameplay is RPG told through the first person perspective, and it refelcts accordingly. Your abilities are limited but progress to your desires.The dystopian cyberpunk vibe is both exhilerating and creepy at the same time. The feeling of 'Oh man I hope the future is this cool' is balanced with, 'Could it really get this bad?' This is the best PC game ever.			"

												This game is a thumbs up. The various locations build a great cyberpunk world. Despite being 15 years old, I'd still say the game looks great. Many of the buildings you come across will be burned into your memory. The music is very, very good and only adds to the already top notch cyberpunk atmosphere. The amount of freedom you're given in your choices and paths you take is staggering for a game so old.It's not without some flaws though. The story gets borderline silly with the amount of conspiracy mumbo jumbo thrown in seemingly just for the sake of being conspiracy mumbo jumbo, the voice acting is downright horrid, and the final boss fight is a bit of a let down. Despite the story shortcomings, it still manages to ask some tough questions about ourselves. Eventually you'll have to come to your own conclusions, and it's there where this game truly shines.			"

												A lot can be said about Deus Ex. One could mention its fantastic soundtrack or its incredible atmosphere/worldbuilding, but that would barely be scratching the surface. Deus Ex's story, in my mind, delivers a powerful message which actually puts itself forward well, and without using the incredibly flawed comparison of augmented individuals to represent oppressed groups which later games in the series tried. It is truly a story of conspiracy, class division and espionage at the highest level of government that really isn't to be missed.Deus Ex is the definition of cyberpunk, and to this day I've never seen a game pull that theme off with such grace and faithfulness to the originators of the genre (namely William Gibson's excellent novel Neuromancer, which I would reccomend to any fan of Deus Ex). I'm not here to write an in-depth pros and cons list about this game, just to sing its praises along with so many others really. Looking past its semi-wonky gameplay and the incredibly dated graphics, Deus Ex is a classic which everybody deserves to experience at least once. If you've ever even passingly considered yourself a fan of cyberpunk, be it from Shadowrun, the Matrix or anything else, play Deus Ex. If you've ever seen somebody playing it and thought to yourself that you might enjoy it, play Deus Ex. No matter who you are, there are very few circumstances under which I would not advise you to play Deus Ex. One of the most deep, interesting, complex stories I've ever experienced in a video game, and all for £5, even when it's not on sale. Icarus!			"

												The 1990's culminated in three monumental titles that undeniably would shape the FPS adventure genre for years to come: Half Life (1998), System Shock 2 (1999), and Deus Ex (2000).Deus Ex was doubtlessly ahead of its time and shares a great deal of the qualities that made Half Life and System Shock 2 superb. Deus Ex's story is about the choices individuals make concerncing technology, and how those technological choices alter the future in positive and negative ways.Everything I want in an FPS adventure is present in Deus Ex: The story is intriguing, the gameplay has depth, and the soundtrack is phenomenal. If you are looking for an old school FPS adventure, Deux Ex is definitely a top choice. There is an easy to use mod that updates the graphics and smoothes them out significantly - highly recommended!9.5/10			"

												I cannot express how much I absolutely love this game. This game is a classic it was ahead of its time, I love the gameplay and the mechanics. This game also has a interesting story to it and it is the FPS I have ever played. This game kinda reminds me of Batman Arkham Asylum in some aspects. You can sneak and hide in the vents and stealthly pick off your enemies one by one. You can distract enemies by making noise and throwing objects. You can also hack computers, use lock picks on doors, and blow up doors. Deus Ex gives you lots of choices to accomplish an objective. The way you kill is also a factor. You can use melee weapons, pistols, heavy guns, and sniper weapons. You can actually increase you effectiveness with using these weapons by raising your experience level in them. I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a very good classic game.			"

												Literally one of the best video games I've ever played. It combines stealth, RPG, cyberpunk, and action so perfectly. Simply running around and talking to strangers is a lot of fun, let alone sneaking through facilities, hacking into computers, and reading nearby databooks. Only problems is that the voice acting is a little cheesy and I can sometimes get really lost. Also, I know you're suppose to use stealth, but my God, it'll take you twenty rounds of assault rifle ammo to his skull to even dent an enemy's health bar. But besides the laughable voice actor, moments where you can barely know what to do, and overpowered enemies, this game is dead near perfect and you should play it.			"

												One of the best games I have ever played. Solid 10/10.As a person who finds it hard to get into dated games that I don't already have a nostalgic attachment to, I found I had no problem with Deus Ex. The dated combat and graphics become endearing after a while and it doesn't really bother me. The areas still look visually pleasing despite the graphics, especially Hong Kong, which is probably my favourite area. The  actual gameplay brought me some of the most fun I'd ever had in a video game - it's quite challenging, depending on how lethal you want JC to be, and it makes you think, not just gun people down (although it's quite tempting to just throw grenades at everyone and go crazy). As for the story, it's well written and interesting, full of great characters and unexpected twists, and it presents you with a tough choice at the end. The Deus Ex soundtrack is also absolutely gorgeous - it's definitely one of my favourite game soundtracks.I cannot recommend this game enough. "

Compare DE's blueprints and compass with DE3's great big *%£$ destination arrow. The fact everything isn't over simplified and handed to you on a plate makes success in DE a far more satisfying affair than it's more pretty but shallow and obnoxious sequels.The graphics are old and the game can be glitchy, but this does not take away from this real masterpiece of a computer game.

												This is probably the best FPS of all time. The story is fantastic, and the game plays almost like an RPG with how you level up your character's skills and abilities. The game is also extremely long. It will probably take you 20 hours just to get through it once. The levels are all large and almost sandbox like, with tons of places to explore outside just the mission you are trying to do. The people in the world can also converse with you and give you interesting information. The game supports multiple play styles (Stealth, run and gun, melee), making each experience and playthrough different. It also has several choices that affect what happens, and three different endings. It's simply a masterpiece. Buy it if you don't have it already. If you do have it, play it right now.			"

												There are plenty of genres where you could lament the absence of good games and the FPS genre is certainly not one of them. There are however few games much like Deus Ex and this is a real shame. Deus Ex not only makes an excellent and lengthy FPS, it makes for an excellent and deep story driven RPG experience too. A focus on just one would have made a good game and it is a testament to just how great Deus Ex is that they have been combined so successfully into an even better one. Even if neither of the genres is of interest to you, you should at least try Deus Ex to see if this wonderful fusion can’t change your mind.			"

You can explore alot on this game and i mean..... ALOT. You can interact with everything and anything alike, so you'll get lost before you know what you're suppost to do. All of this great content with a cost of only a SUPPRISING $7 dollars!			"

												One of the best games I have ever played. Solid 10/10.As a person who finds it hard to get into dated games that I don't already have a nostalgic attachment to, I found I had no problem with Deus Ex. The dated combat and graphics become endearing after a while and it doesn't really bother me. The areas still look visually pleasing despite the graphics, especially Hong Kong, which is probably my favourite area. The  actual gameplay brought me some of the most fun I'd ever had in a video game - it's quite challenging, depending on how lethal you want JC to be, and it makes you think, not just gun people down (although it's quite tempting to just throw grenades at everyone and go crazy). As for the story, it's well written and interesting, full of great characters and unexpected twists, and it presents you with a tough choice at the end. The Deus Ex soundtrack is also absolutely gorgeous - it's definitely one of my favourite game soundtracks.I cannot recommend this game enough. "

												Literally one of the best video games I've ever played. It combines stealth, RPG, cyberpunk, and action so perfectly. Simply running around and talking to strangers is a lot of fun, let alone sneaking through facilities, hacking into computers, and reading nearby databooks. Only problems is that the voice acting is a little cheesy and I can sometimes get really lost. Also, I know you're suppose to use stealth, but my God, it'll take you twenty rounds of assault rifle ammo to his skull to even dent an enemy's health bar. But besides the laughable voice actor, moments where you can barely know what to do, and overpowered enemies, this game is dead near perfect and you should play it.			"

Great gameplay coupled with a good story and held together with great game mechanics ensured that this game would not be forgotten soon. The ability for the player to make choices that feel like they actually have an impact on the game world adds to the immersion, and after completing it you might find yourself compelled to play it again to make different choices.Rating: I WANTED ORANGE/10			"

If you can get past the awkward aiming system and lackluster voice acting, you have yourself a game worthy of any ""Top Ten Games of All Time"" list. Everything you do feels like it has an impact on the world, with the game acknowledging your choices and playstyle. Multiple playthroughs are encouraged, especially since you can't have every augmentation at once, and there are bound to be a hundred little things you missed on your first run.Highly recommended, one of the best games ever.

												Old but gold. Especially for a game that is over 15 years old.Definitely buy this.  For 7 bucks, you get one hell of a ride as an international cop in a globe-trekking adventure in a mid-21st century world where millions die from an unknown plague and active civil war in 'stable' Western countries push society closer and closer to the brink. Although certain gameplay elements, in particular AI behavior ('Duh, my buddy five feet away just started yelling about cops and started shooting, let me continue my patrol - oh wait it's that cop!') and graphics date the game somewhat, the story and atmosphere/level design rivals that of more celebrated franchises today.

												Exceptionally great game. When the first level of the game has like 5 different ways to approach it, is filled with multiple secrets and npc dialogue, you know you got a great game. The variety of how you want to do each level is astounding. You can go loud and lethal and kill everything in site (including your allies), or you can do what I did and take the stealth/non-lethal approach and just knock everyone out. You can literally beat the entire game without killing a single person. Hell, some levels you can avoid interaction with other units entirely. You can just stealth your way through. Weapon variety is good, but what makes it unique is that some weapons have multiple ammo types allowing for interesting diversity. Really fun stuff. Just all around awesome game with tons of replay value and a plethora of content for the price. Still holds up today and is generally better than most games out right now. And just for the record, to those saying that the voice acting can be racist. That's not true. Accents are based on nationality, not race. Chinese, German and Russian are not races, they are nationalities. So saying it's racist to have someone with a crappy, stereotypical German or Chinese accent is just plain wrong.  It's like saying someone doing a New York accent is racist, when New Yorkers aren't a race. :P			"

The best experience of your lifeThat`s right there the best game ever for PC forever. You can`t go wrong with Deus Ex. No sequel, prequel, clone, inspiration, spiritual successor and whatnot could ever dream to match its supremacy. That is indeed the GOD of games, including every known category and platform.That said, don't ever mod this game. Do not tamper with its currently perfect state. It shall never be rebooted, remastered or re-imagined. Because even those people who did it could ever reproduce the same level of success afterwards. It's like their hands were guided by something else. It is ideal the way it is. Even it's ""flaws"" were imperative in keeping the cohesion of this piece of artwork.I was blessed with the godsend honor and infinite landscapes of joy by playing this game right on its launch date. Had many playthroughs throughout my life since them. And once I start, I cannot focus in anything else until its conclusion. "

												Hands done one of the greatest FPS/RPG mixes of all time, as well as one of the best overall games of all time. Two things make this game especially good: the story and the gameplay. The augmentations that you use to add new abilites really drastically change the ways you can approach situations instead of just adding passive bonuses like most perk-like systems in so many other RPGs. Each problem you encounter has a dozen ways of solving it and can be solved by any type of character build, so each player can play through the game in their own unique style. Combat has this aspect as well, as you level up your skills with different weapon types, so you can play as a sharpshooting sniper or a rocket-launcher weilding maniac. Without having to explain every game mechanic, all you need to know is that the gameplay is deep, complex, and can be enjoyed basically however you want.While the actual plot line isn't the best, it's the underlying themes that really make it stand out. Not a lot of games ask the types of questions that Deus Ex asks. How much control should the government have on the people? If people were left to govern themselves, would the good side of humanity win over the evil side, or is man's hunger for power and control too great? What does it mean to be human? Are machines more perfect than man? It's a very philosophical game, and it's great to see different, distinct endings that aren't black-and-white in their morality, they all present different governing philosophies, and it's up to the player to decide which they think is the best as they play through the game.The only drawbacks to the game are the awful voice acting, dodgy engine and the shoddy graphics. However, if you're going to prevent yourself from playing this game because of the poor graphics (even for 2000) and the engine hiccups, your really shouldn't. Particularly with this game as it's rightfully a classic and should be played by anybody who enjoys RPG's, FPS's, or both.			"

The ability to customise your character with the enhancements you choose makes it interesting and gives variety if you enjoyed the game enough to play through it multiple times - which I have.Also the game was an early game which provided options on how you can go about playing through - you can choose to go through stealthily with non-lethal takedowns, you can go in all guns blazing or you can go a technical path by taking over automated defenses and camera's.With how cheap you can pick the game up now and how many different ways there are to play through the game it's definitely worth it in my opinion.

The story makes you to keep going  even when their  faces aren't even moving  while talking; its just the the story and the script that is so good and even the voices some aren't very good but the game has that something that  make you like it. I personally don't like old games, I dont play much of them.

And you definitely won't find another game that gives you as many options to complete it the way you want, as Deus Ex.  And yet so few of you have it.  Don't let the Unreal Engine 1 graphics scare you, there's more details in this game then 2-3 modern games put together. Kinda sad really, in the 11 years since nobody has managed to come close to its artistry, forget matching or surpassing.

												Despite ancient graphics, ancient controls, and simple and by now basically cliché mechanics it somehow stands the test of time. 16 years after its release it is still a fantastic game with an engaging and well-told story, with well-designed levels, and with just the perfect difficulty to both feel challenging to get through just right, yet not impossible to do so.Deus Ex offers a lot of choices. You can play through the game ten times and still approach most of the game's challenges in a different way. Its level design does in that regard surpass most games ever made, and I have to say that the game just does everything... right. There is no level in the game that feels unnecessary, like it doesn't contribute to the story, like it doesn't offer a new kind of puzzle to beat, be it with guns blazing or with trickery.It is a bit of a hurdle to get it to run on modern computers and with today's resolutions, but once past that anyone trying this is in for a glorious ride, and one that anyone enjoying first-person, story-centric stealth (or action) games shouldn't pass on.One doesn't have to play the older Deus Ex games to enjoy the new ones, but they are so good there's just no reason not to.

												When people say this is the greatest game of all time, they are telling the truth. I didn't think it was possible for a 16 year old game dubbed ""The Greatest"" by so many could possibly live up to the hype, or even hold up to modern standards.I was wrong.  It has aged very well (besides the graphics, but it is surprisingly compatable with modern systems). It has more substance than possibly any other game I have ever played, and it puts every modern AAA title to shame. You should at least attempt to play this game before you die.			"

												“Without leaps of imagination or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities.” (Gloria Steinem)Nowadays, most games are well-polished updates of old games: Beautiful or retro graphics, good stories, new environments, well-rounded gameplay - but without new ideas, without invention, without creating anything of their own.Deus Ex was different.Its developers created something never seen before, something fresh, giving players a degree of freedom and choice in accomplishing their objectives that was unprecedented. They got the graphics, sound, story, and other elements on a par with or better than others at the time, but they did more than just that. The game did not fit into an existing genre, it defined its own, took that evolutionary leap into the unknown that has become so rare in the industry. By now, many other games have followed in its path. But Deus Ex was a groundbreaking title, it was the first of its kind. +1 for taking that leap:  11/10			"

Buy it for your netbook or whatever you play your games on when you are on the train. Buy it if you saw it the first time around but never tried it.

												**Deus Ex is my top #1 Favorite game of all time. **It wasn't the amazing ambient soundtrack, the well developed characters you meet and interact with, the game breaking RPG elements in the game, the kick♥♥♥♥♥weapons and items you may find, or the fact that you travel around the world in pursuit of your goal....., it was the well written STORY that kept me coming back! Every time I sat my down and loaded Deus Ex during the wee hours of the night, I was always thinking, ""Whats going to happen next in the story? :D"". No other game has had that kind of an impact on me ever since and that's what makes Deus Ex special. It is a diamond in the rough of gaming. So do what I did, don't do any research on Deus Ex. BUY the game, play it and see for yourself why it's my #1 game of all time. **GORE_TORN'S HIGHEST OFFICIAL SEAL OF APPROVAL!**			"

												The _only_ deus ex game, in my opinion. Sure, invisible war has a few fun parts and ideas, and Human Revolution looks shiny and is modernized, but this game is where the series both begins and ends. Fun first person adventury-shooty game that has complex mechanics if you want to use them, but you don't specifically need to use them if you don't want to. I reccomend getting kenties dx10 renderer, new vision, and biomod to play the original campaign. When you're done, get ""The Nameless Mod"", which is a shining example of HOW TO make a game, and make it GOOD. Human revolution only wishes it could be as good as The Nameless Mod, seriously.			"

												""If god did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him"" Judging by the fact that you are reading this, you have most likely glanced at the game of which this review is about. And you may have noticed the fact the title is partnered with the ostentatious declaration of ""game of the year edition"". One of my biggest problems with this game is that it does not deserve such a title. A more appropriate accolade would probably have to simply be ""Deus Ex: Game of century edition"".Yes, that's right, I found a game that's better than Half-life 2, deal with it 2012 me!This is the part where one usually describes what the game is and a bit about the gameplay, but Deus ex has an exception. But, as a rule of thumb, most people classify it under the simple and undeserving title of ""FPS"", a name unworthy of such a masterpiece. This is due to the seamless blend of RPG elements, Stealth and, of course, First person gameplay of the shooting variety (and no, Fallout 3 is not a ""better example"" because Bethesda never quite grasped what the words ""role-playing"" mean, and give out skill points in as plentiful quantities as the loading time in their games due to the excessive consolization that plagues this industry like the Grey death). Of course, the game is much more complex than this, as you are not necessarily limited to sneaking around urban dystopia and secret laboratories. One can simply go in guns blazing (but this usually results in immediate death) or, in contrast, can complete the entire game without killing a SINGLE person whatsoever. The amount of choice and the way it reacts to your decisions is frightenly high.But, nothing is perfect. The gunplay is fairly weak and the graphics and animations are fairly dodgy, due to it running of the already fairly dated unreal engine. The levels, whilst very expansive and well designed, are a bit boxy and bland, even within the context of a ruined 2052 cyberpunk setting. Its true strength, however, lies within its story. Without spoiling too much it revolves around the player, a ""nano-augmented"" agent (don't worry, it is kind of explained in-game) called JC Denton, who works for UNATCO (United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition), a group formed by the united nations in response to increasing global tensions, including a terrorist strike on the statue of liberty (the game was made in 2000, so it was still perfectly fine to discuss terrorist attacks on New York). But as the player fights the various organizations, he starts to realise there is something very wrong with his overlords, and finds himself a player in a secret war for world dominance. The themes, factions and events in the game are likely from a conspiracy theorist's nutty dream, but simply keeping up to date wiht the state of the world simply provides foreshadowing for the dystopia presented in this game! Whilst most of the exposition and dialogue is extremely well written, its delivery and voice acting is not as refined, simply watch any play through of Hong Kong or Paris to get the idea. But, I suppose there is some charm to hearing Asian triads debate about philosophy in silly accents!On the subject of sound, it is quite obvious that the music does an excellent job of making up for the questionable voice acting. When you first boot up a game and simply get chills from the title screen, you know you've got a gem in your hands! All the the levels have an apprpaite soundtrack that suits them, with seperate themes for ambient, combat, conversations and death. Ah Hong Kong, never again will I be able to go anywhere remotely Asian without feeling like stepping into Wan Chai market for the first time...My final word is that you should absolutely buy this game. It is very cheap ($1.74 in a sale!) and there is simply no excuse for not playing this. There is a well-known phrase that ""Every time you mention Deus Ex, someone will reinstall it"", but this is complete bullocks because no one in their right mind would ever uninstall it; it is the best 700mb on their hard drive! The point being, this is easily the best PC game, if not the best overall game, ever made. It is really quite sad how no game has ever been able to match it after 14 years in terms of complexity and competency.What a shame...			"

												Alright, so I'm playing frickin' Kirby frickin' Kirby Superstar, but guess what? That's not even the point of this video. Alright, I'm gonna talk to you guys about something. Frickin' Doos frickin' EX. WHAT THE FRICK? Okay, seriously, what the frick is this frick? Doos' Ex? WORST FRICKIN' NAME for a video game, one of the worst frickin names for a video game I've ever heard. I mean, COME ON! DOOS EX? So frickin' dumb. BUT GUESS WHAT?! THE TITLE ISN'T EVEN THE WORST PART OF DOOS EX! IN FACT IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE! Alright? I haven't even played Doos Ex and I already know it's a terrible game. In fact, from what I've seen so far, the game gets a negative 30,000 out of 10. That's right you fricks! And guess what? Guess what? I'm gonna explain why this game is frickin' frick! Alright, let's start it up, shall we? Alright, so first of all the game tries too hard to be frickin' violent, real, and dark! I mean, what the frick? These kind of games are frickin' dumb because they are all the frickin' same.OH! I'M GONNA RESCUE YOU! OH I'M GONNA GET KILLED *Imitates gunshot noise* WAAH! WAHH! WAH! WAHHH! WAAAAAH! *Collapses on floor*. So frickin' dumb. Alright? Just a funny impersonation of those types of frickin' games.So this game's one of those games and guess what? IT'S FRICKIN' HORRIBLE! I mean, come on, and the story's so dumb and a bunch of people are dead. ARE YOU FRICKIN' SERIOUS? I mean, really? Really? What the frick? We don't frickin' care! You're just laying like *imitates dead guy holding gun*. Frickin' dumb. And then we have these frickin' cops they're just frickin' talking to each other. WHAT THE FRICK? Oh oh no it's a frickin' cop frickin' video game. DON'T WE ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH OF THOSE? Such a frickin' rip-off. Oh, we should do this because it's a creative idea AND WE CAN'T COME UP WITH ANYTHING ORIGINAL UNLIKE NINTENDO AND SUPER MARIO!Super Mario is the best gaming franchise in the world. Don't deny it! It's the best game franchise in the world and you know it. WHY DO YOU THINK, WHY DO YOU THINK MARIO GAMES ARE SOME OF THE BESTSELLING GAMES ON THE PLANET? ""Oh, I don't know why,"" WELL I'LL TELL YOU WHY! It's because MARIO actually has good games. His games are platforms, the best genre of gaming in the world. AND LET US NOT FORGET HE IS THE KING OF PLATFORMING! HE SET THE STAIRS FOR PLATFORMING! Alright? Not Doos Ex! Doos Ex didn't set the standards for anything! Alright?Second, let's talk about what style game it is. It's a Minecraft style game WAAAAAAAAAAAA! ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I HATE FRICKIN' MINECRAFT! I don't like Minecraft 'cause people waste their lives on there every single day. They're probably just sitting there, y'know, probably just sitting there eating countless bags of chips and turning themselves into frickin' jelly and playing the frickin' game, building frickin' tiles and blocks everywhere and avoiding creepers and inviting their friends online BECAUSE THEY PROBABLY HAVE NO ACTUAL FRIENDS. And using their frickin' weapon sashes to BLOW THINGS UP BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO! So frickin' dumb. Play Mario, play frickin' Mario guys. Alright? Mario is on pretty much every Nintendo system. In fact, he is on every Nintendo system. Alright? The Wii U? Buy it! Playstation? Xbox? DON'T BUY IT! And also, I don't really care about the Nintendo and Apple rivalry because they aren't really rivals. Why do you think Nintendo makes apps for them? So Apple, I don't care you can buy stuff from them too for all I care. Just as long as you guys, y'know, agree that Nintendo is the best gaming company in the world.And I'm sorry if it sounds like I'm forcing my opinions onto you guys 'CAUSE I'M NOT! BUT I'M SIMPLY SUGGESTING WHAT YOU GUYS SHOULD REALLY BE PLAYING! I'M NOT FORCING YOU GUYS! I'M NOT TELLING YOU, ""IF YOU DON'T PLAY NINTENDO, THEN YOU MUST DIE"" 'CAUSE THAT'S NOT THE CASE! I'M SIMPLY IMPLYING THAT NINTENDO'S THE BEST GAME COMPANY IN THE WORLD AND THAT'S WHAT, THAT'S WHAT GAMING SYSTEMS AND GAMES THAT I RECOMMEND THE MOST! ALRIGHT?ERRRRRGH! And another thing. Let's talk about... okay, you see when you look up at Doos Ex, people say that it and Minecraft aren't alike, but LOOK AT IT! Look at the controls! The CAMERA controls! The CHARACTER controls! THEY'RE FRICKIN' UNCONTROLLABLE! BOTH GAMES! BOTH GAMES! *grips sword*Oh yeah, this is my sword by the way. I made it on my own. Unlike you frickin' fricks BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT! Look at it, and then look at the inventory of weapons in Doos Ex! Reminds you of Minecraft, doesn't it? This game- Doos Ex was made before Minecraft but guess what? I STILL DON'T LIKE MINECRAFT! As a matter of fact, I bet in the modern world most people only play Doos Ex because it's like Minecraft! Well guess what? I don't freaking care. I don't like Minecraft and I don't like Doos Ex. I may do a rant on Minecraft in the future.BUT THAT'S THE FUTURE! RIGHT NOW I'M RANTING ON DOOS EX! ALRIGHT?! IS THAT FINE WITH YOU FRICKS? ARE YOU GOING TO HATE ON MY VIDEOS FOR THIS? HUH? HUH? Anyways, 's'continue, shall we? So, um, basically it's a Minecraft-style game which was made before Minecraft though. So, I'm not saying it's a ripoff, but I just hate those kinds of games? Alright? This game is like early Minecraft except Minecraft is more of a simulation game AND THAT'S NOT EVEN THE POINT!Uhm, let's see, oh yeah! Another thing that I hate about this game, alright, I mentioned that the game is uncontrollable, because guess what: IT IS! It is uncontrollable! The camera is uncontrollable, the character is uncontrollable and guess what? All first person games are uncontrollable! People should just y'know, make like, y'know, platformers! Platformers are the best genre. They could make other genre games too. I'm not saying only limit every single game to being a platformer. I'm not saying that. There could also be puzzle games, party games, racing games I DON'T CARE! Please just- please, gaming industry. Just get rid of first person shooters! JUST DO IT! FIRST PERSON SHOOTERS ARE HYPNOTISING GAMERS! They're drawing gamers away from the actually good games Please! Please! Alright?I was born in 1998 when, y'know, that's when Mario 64 and Zelda were popular, especially Ocarina of Time and Super Mario 64. THAT WAS WHEN PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAD TASTE IN GAMING! I wasn't a gamer at that time because I was a frickin' infant, but I got into gaming when I was like, what, 4 or 5 years old and that was when people actually had taste in gaming! That's when Mario reigned because people actually knew what to play. That's when many first person shooters came into play such as Call of Duty and I have to say, around, around 2006 or 2007 that's when, y'know, the quality of games started to go down. Not Nintendo though, but I'm talking about other companies. SEGA being included. Sonic's better now, but still. Sonic '06: DON'T EVEN REMIND ME OF THAT! Gosh.Anyways, so the game's uncontrollable and the camera is uncontrollable and the level design is just horrid. Alright? It's just plain horrid! You go around talking to people exploring the frickin' environment and it's boring as frick. I'll get onto the setting of the game a little bit later, but.AND GUESS WHAT?! When you, y'know, go around and you just, y'know fight people- POORLY DESIGNED. It's half baked; it's- it's just NYA! Why did you people even ask me to talk about this game? Why not ask me to talk about an actually good franchises like Rayman, or, Kirby or Metroid or, y'know, the frickin'... y'know, the frickin'... let's see... or just some other frickin' franchise that's actually good. A franchise that I might actually like?~SammyClassicSonicFan			"

												'Deus Ex' is easily amongst the top five RPG games I've ever played. Ancient PC and backwards-compatibility *cough* is a match made in heaven. I'm a bit late to the party but glad I ended this absolute classic. Coming to the game, the environments were expansive, open, involved a lot of running around and backtracking. This was in contrast to Human Revolution which proved to be fairly linear in comparison. Voice-overs were monotonous and emotionless. But I didn't mind it too much as it suits the entire grim cyberpunk-themed setting of the game. HR was no different in this regard either. Mission structures were very well done. Lots of alternative routes to complete objectives. Many games have a broken system but Deus Ex was flexible enough to cater to both playing styles. I liked how you could go full stealth, all guns blazing or settle with a mixture of the two.Exploration rewarded bonus points which were redeemable in the form of skill upgrades. It was virtually impossible to fully upgrade all skills early in the game so my protagonist never felt over-powered at any point. My main gripe was with the augmentations. Apart from a few augs, I never really found any utility for the others and I tried a variety of playing styles. The story was excellent! It was rich but not too convoluted or branched-out as is the norm in RPGs these days. The plot was focused and almost all side missions had relevance to the main storyline. And the story characters were largely interesting, in a peculiar sort of way. Some observations about its prequel, Human Revolution. I like how it stuck to its roots and also fixed many of the original's shortcomings. Hacking, for instance, was a much improved feature and augs were better utilized.In terms of similarities, playing style was appointed at the very start. You get to choose between a knife (if you like hand-to-hand combat) or a crossbow (if long-range is your preferred method). Some unforeseen choices determine the fate of your friends and allies. Boss fights were, again, laughably easy. And not to forget, multiple endings right at the final juncture. I loved this game. Had the option to apply mods to improve the textures and lighting but I chose to play it in its original glory. Even after more than a decade, this game not only holds but has also aged very well.

												Finally got around to playing this game, after a couple of false starts. I really found it difficult to get in to initially. I failed to make it through the first level every time I played it. Admittedly the game does start with a challenge, and it continues to be challenging throughout. You really have to embrace stealth until you get some decent weapons and skill points. I recommend the mini crossbow and tranq darts! The game really gathers pace after the first level, the soundtrack is excellent, and somehow the graphics stop being so terrible. Use the light aug in tunnels/airducts and dark areas. Save your game often because you can die really easily and there are no automatic save points - you can save the game at any point you want though. It's really great, I have played it non stop for two weeks and just finished it. I think it will have replay value as well because you are offered so many choices during the game.			"

This game has got all the cool stuff like secret passages, freedom to do stuff your way, cool dialogue options (walk in to the girls-room for fun. You won't regret it) If you decide to enter a building using obscure jumping paths, you will notice in the end the developers actually designed everything. There is so much detail and attention to almost everything in this game.

												Deus Ex is a cyberpunk FPS aRPG and is largely regarded as one of the best games of all time. Says something about how just how good a game is when the main argument isn't that this was one of the best games ever made, just whether or not it's aged well over time. That Deus Ex is superb, or at least was superb, is completely uncontested.One of the biggest talking points about Deus Ex is that ""the graphics have aged"". When games like Jet Set Radio, Vagrant Story and Resident Evil Code: Veronica were released in the same year and still hold up to contemporary standards, the argument doesn't hold. Simply that the standards have risen, and so Deus Ex's mediocre art design, and that their environmental modellers clearly bit off much more than they could chew, can no longer ride on the novelty of 3D graphics. They simply did not have the capabilities to bring their vision to life, and instead of making compromises chose to march forward anyway - and that shows.Likewise, that Deus Ex's mechanics have aged into something clunky, doesn't hold weight when mechanically beautiful and smooth games like Rayman 2, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 and Banjo Tooie were released the same year and are still incredibly fun to this day. System Shock 2, another FPS aRPG, was released a year prior and controls smooth as butter. Deus Ex's mechanics didn't suddenly become clunky, they just always were. Regardless of contemporary comparisons, though, the game still has is fair share of problems. After Hong Kong the game easily starts wearing out its welcome and starts dragging on - even though the story itself goes on a rollercoaster ride. It doesn't help that by the end of Hong Kong, they have introduced and established every single mechanic, weapon, augment, tool, and all bar one of the very limited enemy types, and never elaborate or experiment on them beyond that. For all intents and purposes you just largely do the same thing until the end of the game.Clunky mechanics mean that while the game touts supporting multiple playstyles, a pure Stealth/Pacifist run will outright put you to sleep. Inching along with the world's slowest crawl and using the very limited selection of stealth takedown weapons just isn't fun, it's monotonous and awful. The idea of supporting multiple playstyles that take you through completely different paths through the game also falls apart, because after the first mission or two you'll be outright ransacking every corner of levels -  and are largely expected to, to account for JC Denton's vulnerability and lack of resources.Despite all of this, Deus Ex is rightfully regarded as an incredibly good game that has earned the right to your time.It's Blade Runner, bereft of the emotional dialogue, with equal parts near-future Ship of Theseus-induced existentialism, a timeless narrative of class warfare, and a massive dose of utterly ridiculous conspiracy theories treated as fact. The dramatic voice-acting doesn't hold up (""JC, A BOMB"") but the usual cool delivery and rapid-fire discussion of the themes delivers on the premise expertly, with Jay Franke doing a fantastic job as JC Denton. JC Denton is a fantastic example of being a blank slate without actually being a blank slate. The perfect fit for a sounding board for the various political ideologies and conspiracy theories throughout the game, he serves to question and debate the various factions without ever noticeably projecting his own agenda beyond trying to do the right thing.Deus Ex doesn't need perfect graphics, or even fully realized mechanics to be an excellent game - it has managed to cement itself at the higher end of the Wall of Fame with its expertly-directed dialogue, pleasing mechanical complexity and utterly brilliant and satisfying level design that easily remains just as good to this day.And this is why you should buy it and play it right through to the ridiculous end.

												This game is a classic, one of the most deserved GOTY awards  ever received. It is also my nomination for the Test Of Time award.Sure the graphics were dated even at launch, and some spaces seem cramped (especially outdoors) partial scale-models, but it still plays very satisfyingly. The story is fun and cohesive, options abound on how to play, act, and complete missions. There are plenty of RPG elements to make JC feel like YOUR character.The opening Liberty Island mission is still one of my favorites of all time.10/10, would get yelled at for going into the ladies room again			"

												i had just beaten the game. it was amazing, there is (with an exception of a few games) NOTHING that comes close to what this game has achieved. even with its faults, this is one of, if not the greatest games i have ever played. this game proves that even with faults, you can still achieve something so stellar.i am currently undergoing my second playthrough of the game on realistic difficulty with the mods New Vision (makes the games' environments look pretty) and Shifter (adds things that should have been in the game in the first place and fixes allot of bad things in the game), and by god, it is even better. i have currently already poured about 8 hours into the game on my second playthrough, and i am only on the THIRD MAIN MISSION. this game has so much to offer if you go looking for it.on top of that, every decision you make changes the game, from the big things, even to the tiniest detail. for example you can go into the girls bathroom and then get yelled at, and when you go meet up with your boss later on, he will tell you to be careful and stay out of the girls bathroom. but big things can even change what you will do in the next mission. every pretty much playstyle is available in this game. for example so far i haven't killed anyone, and i have mostly relied on melee weapons, but i also have a minicrossbow tranq gun with me. you can be the ruthless killer who kills with nothing but the objects in his hands, or you can be the guy with the silent gun. but you can also be the guy who just wants to go in guns blazing (but it wont be easy), or the guy who picks off enemies from a distance. be who ever you want, where ever you want, whenever you want. mind you, this is not an easy game.so go. go and buy this game. you will not regret it.

												You probably already know why you should buy this game.The branching story.The endless gameplay choice, allowing players to leap between genres from stealth to FPS to hacking simulator and so much more, as well as allowing you to merge these together.The size (this game is huge!).It's cheap and everyone loves it, so the thing preventing you from buying it is probably the barrier to entry that old games often have. I was cautious about this too but, too my surprise, it's not that bad.I would reccommend installing Kentie's Deusexe alternative launcher as it fixes pretty much every problem with modern PCs.Now.Because it's based on player choice, it's usually quite easy to find at least one way to do an objective, so it's not that traditional old game thing of ""what the hell am I supposed to do"". The game has a handy journal which keeps all important information (codes, usernames etc.) which you find in the levels, so you don't need to remember any of these things. Your objectives and sidequest objectives are also stored here. Sidequests can be found in each individual level, usually off NPCs. Completion of these sidequests gives you Exp, items or tips on ways to complete the main objective.                  Each level is like a mini open-world, with people to interact with, paths to discover and sidequests to find/complete. The paths are mainly straightforward and the levels are designed to cater to any playstyle. I enjoy how NPC interactions, particularly debriefings, change depending on what you do. This is to be expected from this type of game, but not to this level. For example, I shot a barkeep to get some free beer (no, you have an alcohol problem) and I was rebuked for it afterwards, with the boss-man even referring specifically to the bar. It extends beyond even this level. At one point I was rebuked for visiting the ladies' toilet. Now that's attention to detail.               Also, becuase of the fact that the main character is voiced by a dev not a voice actor, the lines are very montone and there is a kind of sarcastic humor (I'm not sure it's intentional) which I just find wonderful.Important tips:Don't go non-lethal on your first run, as I tend to in stealth games. It's much more difficult than in most.Don't do a ghost run on your first runThink before you apply weapon modsThere is a ctrl + c, ctrl + v function that works in the journal so you can copy/paste info.I know this isn't the best review, but I thought I'd give it from the perspective of someone who only started playing this year as most of the ones that I saw were from people who played it back in 2000 and have immense nostalgia.Also, the trenchcoat's pretty good.

												Deus Ex is probably best described as a first-person RPG. Set in the near future, you take the role of JC Denton, a nanomachine-enhanced agent working for UNATCO (United Nations Anti-Terrorism Coalition), and set out to foil terrorists and terrorism plots.  I'm not going to spoil the story, but I think in general it's compelling.The gameplay is sublime in that it offers you a variety of ways to approach your objectives, coupled with some of the best level design I've seen in any game. One way of breaking down the game is that you'll receive mission objectives: find this, kill this person, get into this building and so on, but you usually have multiple approaches as to how you tackle them. Deus Ex has you find and use the weapons and tools you find in the environment. In that respect it is familiar ground if you're used to old-school Doom/Quake/Duke Nukem-style first-person shooters. However, unlike those, that primarily focus on the shooting (of course), in Deus Ex it's generally an equally viable option to use stealth and incapacitation to acheive your goals  Or, you can be sneaky in an alternative way and take the cyber warfare route- hack computers to open doors for you if you don't want to look around for the door code, or if you don't have a lockpick to use on it. Your inventory has limited space (think of your items as shapes on a grid that you have to try and slot together as best you can), and the skill points system means that you'll place different emphases on different items. Some will be more useful to some players than others. The skills system is the most prominent RPG element. As you explore places and complete goals, you will earn skill points that can be invested into different skills in order to level them up. Do you want to upgrade your skill with rifles, so it's easier to kill them with a sniper or assault rifle, for instance? Maybe you could use the points to upgrade your hacking abilities instead. Maybe you can use them so that you can heal more health with medkits? Your choice, and in general, neither option is 'wrong'. There's a nice tradeoff between ""Do I drop my rebreather so I can pick up the knife?"", for instance, and ""I've found an underwater passage- I wish I didn't drop my rebreather"", if that makes sense. The level design is great, and complements the wide variety of options. For instance, you'll usually find a door code written down somewhere if you aren't able to hack it open. You can usually disable alarms that would attract enemies... Or you can shoot your way through them if you're feeling confident. There's a wide variety of options to access areas in most instances- it is pleasingly complex. Regarding shooting... it's a double-edged sword. Deus Ex has combat in it. It's certainly permissible to upgrade the different weapon types and kill enemies that way, but it's.... I'm trying to think of how to put it.... It's not that it's not a shooter, or you can't play it like a shooter, but it really is not like Doom, for instance, where it's not an option to avoid your enemies, really.The way the weapons work is that you keep your aim on the enemy for a few seconds in order to make the shot accurate. You can find in-game weapon mods that increase clip size, accuracy, add scopes and silencers for instance, but in general it means that if the game becomes a firefight with you and a bunch of terrorists, you will be likely to miss a lot if you keep moving around. This is in contrast to the likes of Doom, that relied on you moving out the way of enemy fire, and never penalised your accuracy for it. Here it's slower, and dare I say, a bit clumsier, because, well, it's just not a straight-up shooter. It doesn't seem to be designed like an FPS, put simply. Basically, if Deus Ex were only a FPS, it would not compare that well to the classic PC shooters- Doom/Quake/Duke Nukem etc. As it stands though, it's a fantastic game, with intricate level design that allows multiple angles of attack, as well as multiple tools and skills that allow you to choose your approach, and by extension, how you choose to play the game, without seeming like you're forced onto one track, the mentallity of ""I put points in lockpicking, so I have to keep picking my way through doors each time."". Nope- perfecly feasible to look around for a code if you feel like it. It's a fantastic example of level and gameplay design, Deus Ex. Thoroughly recommend.			"

												*EDIT* Now that i fully finished the game, i get why it's constantly in the top spot or contending for it on all list of top games, it's purely art. 16 years later with what's now considered crappy visuals, laughable voice acting, ugly combat, it still tops out. There's something magical about it, the story, the constant acts of betrayal, down to the choices you have to make, it was a thrilling and enjoyable ride that i would definetely reccomend to anyone interested in rpgs, fps, or just general story telling. A must own game.Only 5 hours into the game and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥i'm overwhelmed. I kind of regret never playing it before. This game offers pretty much everything you want in a tactical fps whether you want to go head-on combat (Which isn't encouraged by your higher officers) or a full on stealth gameplay with lockpicking, hacking, finding new paths by exploration, negotiating with people, reading notes and so many other ways. Even for a 2000 game in my opinion it still looks nice, the enviroment is well done, the music is great, lots of variety in weapons and items with almost everything having a use. Well, can't wait to see what else this game has to offer, to be updated.			"

												Is DEUS EX the greatest game ever?It might be. Seldom, if ever, has a game blended so well elements of first person shooters, stealth, assassin and puzzle games, all into an RPG with great combat, minigames, and a self-driven narrative. While it is stylistically dated--shades of the MATRIX show throughout--the story is a rich one, and the game has remarkable replay value. Rarely is it ever the same game twice. Play it now, play it again, and live the perfect Cyberpunk RPG. 15 years after it hit shelves, it's still a treasure for gamers everywhere.			"

												Holy christ, I just saw this game on sale for one dollar and seventy-four cents. $1.74. Get it. This game is an absolute gem and a legend within the cyberpunk genre. An early rpg/fps entry that oozes nostalgia and exudes genius. I'm not the best at reviewing games, but there are those hidden amongst Steam that I feel are too amazing not to promote... this is one of them.You play as agent JC Denton, a shiny new nano-augmented agent (successor to mechanically-augmented agents) in a counter-terrorist organization dubbed UNATCO. The secretive politicking and social banter you'll be exposed to can be overheard from enemies mid-conversation, read through security terminals throughout the gameworld, deluged via e-mails sent to your character (as well as other non-player characters, provided you can gain access to their accounts...) will influence how you want to play your character. Do you blindly obey the higher-ups in your organization, or lean toward the ideals of UNATCO's enemy--a 'terrorist' organization calling themselves the NSF.Between the conspiracy theories, feeding homeless kids for intel, jumping on rats, getting turnt on zyme, breaking into storage rooms for bags of soy nuts... there's intelligent humor and timeless music to help you immerse yourself in Ion Storm's take on a futuristic dystopian United States of America.OH AND NOT TO MENTION: REVISION. It's a breathtaking graphical overhaul of the game, provided as a free DLC through Steam. Deus Ex is given a facelift for the 21st century (which goes deeper than mere graphics, mind you) and you're also given the option to play the game with two of it's most famous mods-Biomod and Shifter.Again, I'm no good at reviewing but by all that is holy, you need to pick up this classic masterpiece in PC gaming. $1.74, I still can't believe it!!!Welcome to the coalition, JC.

												Every time I play this game, I find something new. I must have played it through at least 7 times at this point. No other game I have played has had the level of detail or choice that this game offers. Developers now have to worry about making sure their game fulfils so many different criteria, but this game could just focus on being a great first person RPG. All you need is the HD texture pack and DX11 launcher, and it runs as well as it ever did, and looks great too. A timeless classic.			"

												Deus Ex: released Jun. 22, 2000A summary of gameplay: exploration and stealth (or combat if need be)To make it clear, this game, unlike its sequel is amazing, the world is filled with so many plot points (hidden away, to be discovered) and a large variation of approches for hostile territories. You never have a formal tutorial, but an optional and advised traing, which only covers basic mechanics, the rest is for the player to learn, wether that be ideal stealthy approches or how to survive a shootout. Overall, can't but keep my hands away from this game as it's always fresh every replay. Reccomended: YES!			"

												Alright I'm doing this for the steam awards thing, but I just want to say this is one of the coolest old games out there. Honestly, I was torn between nominating this or half life for the test of time award, but I decided to go with this. The story is fantastic, and the world is incredible. Lots of options in what you do. Really my only concerns are the game play (for example, shooting was a little messy) and the setup to get the game to work well, since it isn't great for today's systems. I can't remember the program you need to make it a bit better. Mouse acceleration was also a problem. If you'll excuse me, I have to go redownload this.			"

												When people say this is the greatest game of all time, they are telling the truth. I didn't think it was possible for a 16 year old game dubbed ""The Greatest"" by so many could possibly live up to the hype, or even hold up to modern standards.I was wrong.  It has aged very well (besides the graphics, but it is surprisingly compatable with modern systems). It has more substance than possibly any other game I have ever played, and it puts every modern AAA title to shame. You should at least attempt to play this game before you die.			"

												I thought my hours were low in this game until i browsed through the reviews. This game should have won the Test of Time Award last year. 17 years after release the vanilla game is still getting 92% positive reviews. You can't beat it. Then to top the icing on the cake. Say you've beat the game 5+ times (me), and you would like to play it but want a twist on it. Easy. There's tons of fan missions, backstory missions, Graphical upgrades for those of you who don't like the early 2000s graphics. I actually like the graphics myself, but I am going to download the GMDX mod, so it can be a little different this playthrough. Next time, I will do the modded missions. I just don't see myself getting bored with this one any time soon.If you don't own this game and don't mind older graphics, you need this game.If you don't own this game and hate old graphics, you need this game and GMDX.There are other graphics mods but they don't look as polished and GMDX isn't even out of beta yet. Also, GMDX is an entire overhaul for the game, not just the graphics.The gameplay style isn't just your typical FPS. Far from it. You are limited on ammo, you have to find upgrades and there are lots of secret passages. My description is not doing the game justice though. To kill or to incapacitate? Either are very viable choices. The changes that are made are usually very minor. Although you can make a few choices in the game that will cause different outcomes for people.I usually play lethal in this game. I have done non lethal for one or two of my playthroughs.$7. 105 hours and counting. Lots of mods. It's well worth your money. You could probably catch it on sale at some points too, but its more than worth it at full price.BTW, my favorite weapon is the Dragon's Tooth. Once you get it, you will know what I mean.And no, I didn't play the game when it first came out. The first Deus Ex that I played was a demo of Invisible War, then many years later I saw this game had outstanding reviews and it was on sale, so I bought it. This was around 2009 or so.  At first, it was too difficult so I uninstalled after about 30 minutes. Then I gave it another try about a year later.			"

												A very atmospheric and immersive for a game that was made in 2000, it certainly doesn't show its age, sans the graphics, which look great for Unreal Engine 1.  This game has a vibe kind of like Blade, The Matrix, at least that is how I feel.  The music is absolutely ""unreal"" and the voice acting is top notch for a game made in 2000.  The game can be played in many different ways and has tons of unlockables.  Very rewarding, I cannot stress that enough.  If you enjoy old school FPS games where the maps were non linear, sidequests were there for fun, and secrets were scattered, this game is most certainly for you and is worth every penny.  Truly an experience like none other.  In other words, BUY IT.			"

												Deus Ex...wow... Deus Ex, for the uninitiated is one of the best PC games of all time. And, I do mean taht literally, there are only a couple that are better. First things first, every PC gamer needs to play this. So, what is DX? Deus Ex is a stealth RPG from teh late 90s. It (obviously) looks absolutely terrible, but it even looked bad on release. The plot is hokey, featuring the illuminati, nanomachines being used to augment humans into supersoldiers, and artificial plauges. But, for some reason, everyone absolutely adores it. Gamers are universally overcome with nostalgia, and Deus Ex has so much content and ""emergent gameplay"" (putting things in teh game you don't even know how people will use it or if they can) that like so ew titles these days can have multiple pllathroughs that share nothing more than cutscenes and dialouge. The gameplay an stealth is actually kind of tough, and you will learn to love the quicsave adn quickload buttons. The sound is comically bad in many places too. However, there are some mods, like Deus Exe, HDTP, New vision adn teh upcoming Revision that hep it look acceptable. Seriously, go play it, or maybe watchthe totalbiscuit video on it at least. 11/10			"

												This game is the best game of all time. The story is deep and draws from major conspiracy theories (Ex. Illuminate,Chupucabra, The Mothman). As you progress through the game you will gather skill points. All skills have 4 levels:UntrainedTrainedAdvancedMasterThe game is very balanced, until you get a master skill in weapons. You see as you progress in weapons the changes are noticeable but not tremendously game changing, but... once you hit master in a weapons category.... you are GOD. My pistol (as long as I am aiming at somebody) can't miss. I have put 4 accuracy mods (each pumping up the accuracy by 2% I think) and all I have to do is aim above the torso and everybody DIES. There are many skills to talk about, such as lockpicking and bypassing electronics. You can open any door and bypass any alarm as long as you have enough multitools (electronic lockpicks) and enough lockpicks (well um... not-electronic lockpick). But a person who is not trained in the lockpicking and elctronics skills will leave more broken lockpicks and shorted out multitools than a minecrafter leaves behind broken pickaxes and shovels. So investing in those skills is not necessary but it really helps (but a word to the wise NEVER INVEST IN SWIMMING THERE WILL NEVER BE A TIME WHERE SWIMMING IS REQUIRED TO GET TO A OBJECTIVE! IT IS A VERY STUPID IDEA!) However by far the best part about this game is that it has more freedom of choice than any other game out there. There are literally hundreds of ways to solve a objective. Let's say you need to recover sensitive data about your organization.What do you want to do? Do you want to equip your trusty plasma rifle (heavy weapons) and go in guns blazing, or do you want to sneak in and quietly neutralisethe guards, or how about you hack that computer you didn't even know about and flood the entire building with lethal amounts of radiation then equip a hazmat suit and grab the data without ever pulling the trigger, or maybe you bribe that terrorist guard you didn't even know had dialouge and have him gat the data for you. Well what do you choose, I mean you don't have to, you can find your own way in (THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE SWIMMING NICK!) because there are definetly more options that I haven't found yet. Okay you got the data and you ar eleaving the area WHEN SUDDENLY! The terrorist leader appears! As far as you know he is a very bad guy! He has killed friends of yours before and he will probably do so again! He asks for the data and he will kill your brother if you don't give it to him! Now it appears that there are only two options, BUT WHAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW EAS THAT AFTER YOU MAKE YOUR DECISION IN THAT BRIEF TIME THAT HE WAS HEADING TO HIS CAR... you could put a bullet straight through the back of his head. You know the dozen armed men that he broght with him will be SUPER♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥if you did that, but hey you are super badass JC Denton you probably have a way out of this predicament already... or maybe you never got into that situation at all.....

												""If god did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him"" Judging by the fact that you are reading this, you have most likely glanced at the game of which this review is about. And you may have noticed the fact the title is partnered with the ostentatious declaration of ""game of the year edition"". One of my biggest problems with this game is that it does not deserve such a title. A more appropriate accolade would probably have to simply be ""Deus Ex: Game of century edition"".Yes, that's right, I found a game that's better than Half-life 2, deal with it 2012 me!This is the part where one usually describes what the game is and a bit about the gameplay, but Deus ex has an exception. But, as a rule of thumb, most people classify it under the simple and undeserving title of ""FPS"", a name unworthy of such a masterpiece. This is due to the seamless blend of RPG elements, Stealth and, of course, First person gameplay of the shooting variety (and no, Fallout 3 is not a ""better example"" because Bethesda never quite grasped what the words ""role-playing"" mean, and give out skill points in as plentiful quantities as the loading time in their games due to the excessive consolization that plagues this industry like the Grey death). Of course, the game is much more complex than this, as you are not necessarily limited to sneaking around urban dystopia and secret laboratories. One can simply go in guns blazing (but this usually results in immediate death) or, in contrast, can complete the entire game without killing a SINGLE person whatsoever. The amount of choice and the way it reacts to your decisions is frightenly high.But, nothing is perfect. The gunplay is fairly weak and the graphics and animations are fairly dodgy, due to it running of the already fairly dated unreal engine. The levels, whilst very expansive and well designed, are a bit boxy and bland, even within the context of a ruined 2052 cyberpunk setting. Its true strength, however, lies within its story. Without spoiling too much it revolves around the player, a ""nano-augmented"" agent (don't worry, it is kind of explained in-game) called JC Denton, who works for UNATCO (United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition), a group formed by the united nations in response to increasing global tensions, including a terrorist strike on the statue of liberty (the game was made in 2000, so it was still perfectly fine to discuss terrorist attacks on New York). But as the player fights the various organizations, he starts to realise there is something very wrong with his overlords, and finds himself a player in a secret war for world dominance. The themes, factions and events in the game are likely from a conspiracy theorist's nutty dream, but simply keeping up to date wiht the state of the world simply provides foreshadowing for the dystopia presented in this game! Whilst most of the exposition and dialogue is extremely well written, its delivery and voice acting is not as refined, simply watch any play through of Hong Kong or Paris to get the idea. But, I suppose there is some charm to hearing Asian triads debate about philosophy in silly accents!On the subject of sound, it is quite obvious that the music does an excellent job of making up for the questionable voice acting. When you first boot up a game and simply get chills from the title screen, you know you've got a gem in your hands! All the the levels have an apprpaite soundtrack that suits them, with seperate themes for ambient, combat, conversations and death. Ah Hong Kong, never again will I be able to go anywhere remotely Asian without feeling like stepping into Wan Chai market for the first time...My final word is that you should absolutely buy this game. It is very cheap ($1.74 in a sale!) and there is simply no excuse for not playing this. There is a well-known phrase that ""Every time you mention Deus Ex, someone will reinstall it"", but this is complete bullocks because no one in their right mind would ever uninstall it; it is the best 700mb on their hard drive! The point being, this is easily the best PC game, if not the best overall game, ever made. It is really quite sad how no game has ever been able to match it after 14 years in terms of complexity and competency.What a shame...			"

												i had just beaten the game. it was amazing, there is (with an exception of a few games) NOTHING that comes close to what this game has achieved. even with its faults, this is one of, if not the greatest games i have ever played. this game proves that even with faults, you can still achieve something so stellar.i am currently undergoing my second playthrough of the game on realistic difficulty with the mods New Vision (makes the games' environments look pretty) and Shifter (adds things that should have been in the game in the first place and fixes allot of bad things in the game), and by god, it is even better. i have currently already poured about 8 hours into the game on my second playthrough, and i am only on the THIRD MAIN MISSION. this game has so much to offer if you go looking for it.on top of that, every decision you make changes the game, from the big things, even to the tiniest detail. for example you can go into the girls bathroom and then get yelled at, and when you go meet up with your boss later on, he will tell you to be careful and stay out of the girls bathroom. but big things can even change what you will do in the next mission. every pretty much playstyle is available in this game. for example so far i haven't killed anyone, and i have mostly relied on melee weapons, but i also have a minicrossbow tranq gun with me. you can be the ruthless killer who kills with nothing but the objects in his hands, or you can be the guy with the silent gun. but you can also be the guy who just wants to go in guns blazing (but it wont be easy), or the guy who picks off enemies from a distance. be who ever you want, where ever you want, whenever you want. mind you, this is not an easy game.so go. go and buy this game. you will not regret it.

												This game is a classic, one of the most deserved GOTY awards  ever received. It is also my nomination for the Test Of Time award.Sure the graphics were dated even at launch, and some spaces seem cramped (especially outdoors) partial scale-models, but it still plays very satisfyingly. The story is fun and cohesive, options abound on how to play, act, and complete missions. There are plenty of RPG elements to make JC feel like YOUR character.The opening Liberty Island mission is still one of my favorites of all time.10/10, would get yelled at for going into the ladies room again			"

												Deus Ex is probably best described as a first-person RPG. Set in the near future, you take the role of JC Denton, a nanomachine-enhanced agent working for UNATCO (United Nations Anti-Terrorism Coalition), and set out to foil terrorists and terrorism plots.  I'm not going to spoil the story, but I think in general it's compelling.The gameplay is sublime in that it offers you a variety of ways to approach your objectives, coupled with some of the best level design I've seen in any game. One way of breaking down the game is that you'll receive mission objectives: find this, kill this person, get into this building and so on, but you usually have multiple approaches as to how you tackle them. Deus Ex has you find and use the weapons and tools you find in the environment. In that respect it is familiar ground if you're used to old-school Doom/Quake/Duke Nukem-style first-person shooters. However, unlike those, that primarily focus on the shooting (of course), in Deus Ex it's generally an equally viable option to use stealth and incapacitation to acheive your goals  Or, you can be sneaky in an alternative way and take the cyber warfare route- hack computers to open doors for you if you don't want to look around for the door code, or if you don't have a lockpick to use on it. Your inventory has limited space (think of your items as shapes on a grid that you have to try and slot together as best you can), and the skill points system means that you'll place different emphases on different items. Some will be more useful to some players than others. The skills system is the most prominent RPG element. As you explore places and complete goals, you will earn skill points that can be invested into different skills in order to level them up. Do you want to upgrade your skill with rifles, so it's easier to kill them with a sniper or assault rifle, for instance? Maybe you could use the points to upgrade your hacking abilities instead. Maybe you can use them so that you can heal more health with medkits? Your choice, and in general, neither option is 'wrong'. There's a nice tradeoff between ""Do I drop my rebreather so I can pick up the knife?"", for instance, and ""I've found an underwater passage- I wish I didn't drop my rebreather"", if that makes sense. The level design is great, and complements the wide variety of options. For instance, you'll usually find a door code written down somewhere if you aren't able to hack it open. You can usually disable alarms that would attract enemies... Or you can shoot your way through them if you're feeling confident. There's a wide variety of options to access areas in most instances- it is pleasingly complex. Regarding shooting... it's a double-edged sword. Deus Ex has combat in it. It's certainly permissible to upgrade the different weapon types and kill enemies that way, but it's.... I'm trying to think of how to put it.... It's not that it's not a shooter, or you can't play it like a shooter, but it really is not like Doom, for instance, where it's not an option to avoid your enemies, really.The way the weapons work is that you keep your aim on the enemy for a few seconds in order to make the shot accurate. You can find in-game weapon mods that increase clip size, accuracy, add scopes and silencers for instance, but in general it means that if the game becomes a firefight with you and a bunch of terrorists, you will be likely to miss a lot if you keep moving around. This is in contrast to the likes of Doom, that relied on you moving out the way of enemy fire, and never penalised your accuracy for it. Here it's slower, and dare I say, a bit clumsier, because, well, it's just not a straight-up shooter. It doesn't seem to be designed like an FPS, put simply. Basically, if Deus Ex were only a FPS, it would not compare that well to the classic PC shooters- Doom/Quake/Duke Nukem etc. As it stands though, it's a fantastic game, with intricate level design that allows multiple angles of attack, as well as multiple tools and skills that allow you to choose your approach, and by extension, how you choose to play the game, without seeming like you're forced onto one track, the mentallity of ""I put points in lockpicking, so I have to keep picking my way through doors each time."". Nope- perfecly feasible to look around for a code if you feel like it. It's a fantastic example of level and gameplay design, Deus Ex. Thoroughly recommend.			"

												There's a cliché about this game being re-installed every time it's mentioned. That's very nearly true for me because I can't even remember how many times I've re-installed this game. I never played it until it was almost 10 years old and woefully out of date graphically but, man, this game blew me away. The freedom of choice, the sense of exploration,  the atmospheric setting, and the awesome old-school tracker music all come together to make this game an unforgettable experience. It isn't perfect (mainly because of the terminally stupid and nearsighted AI), but it sure comes close.			"

												First of, by reviewing this im putting myself into gaming expectations of the level of late 90s.Deus Ex is actually a VERY good scifi game for a 2000 game.RPG elements and dialogues that can overcome most (if not all) of the games that tried to combine FPS and RPG till then (and after it).Unique ingame features and elements.Good graphics with big environments, nice music.The story is very interesting, paying attention to the dialogues helps the player get deep into the plot.Ingame there are some many cool characteristics.Upgrades and updates, special skills, a very great variety of items, a decent small number of weapons, interesting unteractions with NPCs.Also all the game is put during night. The player really gets the sence of diving into a spooky underworld with crime, conspiracies and unexpected turnout of events.Recommended for gamers who like to look into things with different perspective.And a nice way to see how the Deus Ex series started.

												Truly one of the very best games ever made. The graphics are dated but the gameplay certainly is not. This game is an FPS with dialogue choices similar to modern games like Fallout 3/4/New Vegas. These dialogue choices that you are given do matter and do create differences in the story. There is a rudimentary lockpicking and computer hacking system. There are basic stealth tactics that can be used. Story missions take place in open world maps that change from one to another as the game progresses. It's really a fantastic experience. It will always be near the top of my all time list.			"

If you want to go guns blazing you can. If you wanna sneak around and hack stuff, you can. If you want to be an INVISIBLE NINJA slicing people up with your LASER SWORD (my strategy), you can.Also, the plot is really interesting, full of betrayal, conspiracies, and liars. You know the story is good when you want to wander around the city, talking to everyone just in case someone knows something about the big picture.It's a bit dated gameplay/graphics wise, but still: good game.

												Deus Ex is fun. I played through of this because I like Mankind Divided, then went back to play through Human Revolution, and the next step was naturally to play through the original game again, to see how it holds up.To begin with, on a modern machine (assuming you have an 1080p screen), get New Vision. It doesn't change anything when it comes to gameplay, but it makes sure that you can read the books as the scaling isn't really working with the original game. New vision also improves the textures, so the game looks slightly better. Otherwise you are stuck with low resolutions and some problems with the game being very dark.When it comes to narrative and storytelling, the first Deus Ex is still on pair / actually better than Human Revolution (Mankind Divided is worse). When it comes to choices, it is on pair with Human Revolution. When it comes to action, it is a hair better than Human Revolution and much better than Mankind Divided. The game is playable with stealth (althrough it is very difficult compared to the later installments), you can run around guns blazing, you can go non-lethal and you can go melee. There are a lot of options and choices. The game doesn't really moralizes too much on decisions (like Mankind Divided), so the player can do as it likes.I was actually surprised how good the game still is and how well it aged. Deus Ex is one of the best fps games ever made and I was suprised how well it still holds, after all these years.			"

												Far better than my experience on the PS2, however I find this game very hard, especially if you are new to this kind of game that gives you many, many options. You have to know what you want to specialise in or otherwise you get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you every time. I hate the lack of a shop too, somewhere I could offload the junk I pick up to buy some new stuff would be great. However the story itself is what it's famous for and it is quite believeable that the things that are going on behind the scenes could actually happen in a futuristic world.			"

												This game is a masterpiece! Of course it didn't age well, but if a game has a golden ribbon on it, saying masterpiece, then it doesn't matter how old it is! BTW it predicted the terror attacks on the World Trade Center (9/11/2001) and other things as well!


Deus Ex came out in 2000 and predicted that the World Trade Center will be destroyed by terrorists.

												I remember when this game came out back in 2000.  It was around my birthday and I absolutely had to buy the game.  In fact I wouldn't leave my parents alone because PC Gamer, well to put it simply, they said I HAD TO GO BUY THE GAME RIGHT NOW!! haha.  So finally getting them to cave in, I bought the game, went home, and installed it and oh dear god, I lost myself in a world where everything just felt right.  The mechanics, the messages, the feel, the world, hell even the somewhat dated graphics felt good.  That game shed so much light on me on what a game should be.  Graphics were not everything.  Story.  Story was the soul for a game.  And sure I dont have very many hours in the steam version of this game, but if I could bring up my old save files and show you, I would have hundreds.  I think when I did finally stop playing the game for other games, I clocked in nearly 500 hours.  If not more.  I beat the game even on the hardest difficulty.  This game seduced me and sure there were some flaws (seriously which game doesnt have flaws in it) but stop reading this review and go play this game right now!!			"

												(Obviously doesn't represent my actual game time as i spent all of it on the non-steam retail copy)Deus Ex to me is the greatest game ever made.Now that's not to say that it doesn't have its fair share of flaws as no game is ever perfect and they all have their flaws. the graphics even at the time weren't great and were pretty blocky even then, the AI can be really stupid at times and a lot of the foreign voice acting is laughable at best but what makes Deus Ex so great isn't any individual aspect on it's own but the experience as a whole.From one of the most amazing and memorable soundtracks of all time, to one of the best storys in videogame history full of plot twists and memorable characters, to the wide open level design and the sheer variety of gameplay methods to tackle each mission, even to all the different conversation choices that can make a serious impact down the line.It's all these elements combined together that makes Deus Ex truly a one of a kind game that is unlike any other and even  if you are one of the people that can't get past dated graphics and some of the gameplay features, there are plenty of mods out there that can help make the game feel even better.Theres even tons of replay value as well with all the different choices and augmentations that you can take as well as all the secrets that you can find on each level if you look hard enough, i was still finding new secrets years after i finished the game for the first time. Bottom line is if you even have a slight interest in Action/Role Playing/Stealth or just terrific story telling in general then Deus Ex is a game that you must experience			"

												Absolutely fantastic game, one of the definitive titles that comes to mind with the words ""Classic PC Gaming""While this game falls far short if you view it as either and FPS or an RPG, it shines when you strip it of a genre and see it for what it is, a unique amalgamation of the two combined with incredible level design, meaningful exploration, a compelling plot, one of the catchiest soundtracks around, and that special voice acting so bad it's charming.While the game feels rather clunky at first, especially if you don't understand how the RPG mechanics affect the combat, this is soon overcome, and JC(your meme-tastic protagonist), will be running at obscene speeds, leaping over giant robots, tanking bullets, breathing underwater, and shooting drones out of his arm. The game has fantastic replay value while taking you linearly through a series of large levels that can be completed in entirely different manners depending on your character build.Absolutely recommend for anyone who likes a quality video game, this one will take 20-30 hours depending on how you play it.

												Whoever excuses himself from playing this by saying that the game ""aged badly"", needs to rethink their life. Just like HL and SS2 did, DE changed how games were viewed by the public, giving the player a deep and rich story to be involved in, which went from real life politics to conspiracy theories, while revolutionizing with the new RPG FPS genre. Ion storm put all their effort and love into this game, which sadly didn't include all the features that were planned, but still turned out to be one of the best videogames to be released to date.  Whoever wants to know more about the DE universe, look up the Deus Ex bible.			"

												There are three endings, in which your choice literally determines the fate of the world; it’s remarkable how the writers managed to concoct such a situation from which three very different outcomes could emerge. And it’s genuinely difficult to choose, when the time comes (and unlike a lot of games I could mention, the conditions for each ending are very clear-cut). I went with my gut feeling just as I did the first time I finished the game all those years ago, picking a kind of benevolent dictatorship, which meant turning my back on an old friend. And I felt genuinely bad for betraying him, for derailing his most worthy intentions. When a game can elicit that kind of emotion for a character who is a few lines of code, some sound files and a 3D model, that’s probably about when you’re hitting the magic criteria of art.			"

Back in 2005 I was a kid with no money for games and I still would have bought a copy of this game then. I played a demo in 2002 that was cool as hell and I knew at some point in my life I would own Deux Ex. However they did not sell it in my area back then so I shamefully pirated it. Now I bought this game bacause it deserves it. I still remember all weapons, how they could get improved ... the augmentations on JC ... the puzzle, the areas, the ENDING(S)! Graphics are old now but who the hell cares when you have gameplay this good and a story that is even better! I recommend this game with all my heart, a truly epic classic.			"

												Deus Ex is a cyberpunk RPG with FPS elements... or is it the other way around? The game places you in the shoes of a nano-augmented U.N. super-soldier, fighting terrorism across the globe as you uncover conspiraces around you and secret underground bases literally everywhere. The story takes you through the dark alleyways of New York, the Paris catacombs, the cramped, neon quarters of Hong Kong and the white h- Oh, wait. The levels are huge, littered with bonus items and side-quests for the explorer, and even more context is added when you read the numerous newspapers, books and datacubes scattered around.It's all about freedom of choice. You can go through the entire game without killing anyone, sneaking through each area and pacifying targets with non-lethal means, but you can also play Rambo, running and gunning down enemies with a vast array of customizable futuristic weapons. On the other hand, you could stay perched atop a rooftop and pick off targets with a sniper rifle, or try to smooth talk your way into privileged information. You can also choose whether to enter an enemy base through the front door (probably not a good idea), find an alternate entrance through air ducts, or bypass a locked rear entrance by finding the code or hacking the keypad.The voice acting isn't great, the AI isn't terribly smart and some of the design choices were ill-advised (Swimming and environmental protection, anyone?), but they're easily overlooked. Graphically, it can seem a bit dated (It was made on the modified Unreal 1 engine, after all.), but this is easily remedied with the user-made HD texture pack, DirectX10 Renderer and ENB Series. Aesthetically though, it's gorgeous. It's a world of industrial decay, towering buildings, dark alleyways, a somber castle, an secret world under the city, a grayeard full of secrets, as well as some familiar settings (Hell's Kitchen, for instance, used a reference of the real-world location for its design)Add to that a vast plethora of mods and multiplayer deathmatch/team modes and you've got quite a bit of staying power. Oh, yeah, and the music is awesome.Upon release, this game received universal praise and earned top spots on countless ""best games ever"" lists, including PC Gamer's. To this day, whenever the game is mentioned, it's re-installed en masse. As revolutionary as Half-Life and highly influential, it's definitely worth a playthrough.			"

												First time I played this game, it was back in 2k02 on PS2, and I was clueless how to end this game (I didn't go further than Hell's Kitchen).Gameplay :This game was revolutionnary back in the days, because you could choose HOW to play the game (wants to play stealth, guns blazed, both mixed). And because of that, you always find new things. Even after 100 hours, you'll still find new areas and new histories. The developers put a lot of love in this game.Graphics :The graphics and physics are good for 2k, and it was full of glitches. But still, the gameplay was so good that you passed over the glitches and enjoyed the game.Sound/ambiance :This game has one of the best soundtrack I have ever heard in a video game. The main menu theme is just biblical (fall in love first time I heard it), and other sounds played in different areas of the game are pretty awesome, even scary sometimes.My advices if you want to play it :First levels are kind of easy, and it introduce you to the game. I would recommend to make sure you understand game mechanics before entering Hong Kong. After leaving the Boeing 747, the game's difficulty increase drastically (new enemies, etc...). So, if you feel like you missed something, replay the game at the beginning, and be prepare to go further.If it's your first playthrough, I would recommend this:- At the start of the game, upgrade your skills Computer/Lockpicking/Electronics at Trained. It'll help you to deal easily with most doors/security spots without wasting dozens of Lockpicks/Multitools.-  When Paul Denton give you the choice between 3 weapons at the start of the game, choose the GEP gun (a rocket-launcher very usefull against bots later in the game). You'll find on your way to the UNATCOHQ a mini-crossbow, and a NSF terrorist hold a Sniper Rifle near the main entrance of the Liberty Statue.- Make sure to check every areas to find some stuff : there is a lot of hidden places.- Through the game, I recommend to Master the Rifle skill, because you can OS every humans with an headshot and destroy turrets/cameras with one shoot. After that, upgrade Heavy skill to Advanced. It's necessary because holding the GEP gun make you extremely slow, and Advanced skill remove that slow. I would recommend then to upgrade Swimming/Medicine to Trained once it's done.- For the augmentations, it'll fits your gameplay path. But I recommend to pick these ones : Speed Enhancment for legs, Cloack and Radar Transparency for Subdermal, Regeneration(OP thing)/Aqualung/Synthetic Heart for torso, Spydrone for cranial, and Vision Enhancement for eyes(because your vision is augmented).I really recommend to purchase if you like challenging games.10/10			"

												Total 'effin classic. Period.You have an epic conspiracy tale that draws heavily upon Cyberpunk themes , like a blend of the X-Files and William Gibson's Neuromancer. Crazy rogue A.I.s? Check. Illuminati style conspiracies with century old roots? Check. Alien Autopsies in the basement of top secret military installations? Check.It's an FPS primarily but with a heavy dose of RPG. You will be finding and unlocking upgrades for both your characters augmented abilities and your weapons. This allows you to enhance your character towards the prefered path you take through the game. Whether you hack, stay in the shadows, or go guns blazing you'll find an element of the levels to meet your needs. Choice is the word, and for the most part every choice is fleshed out very well. However, gunplay is a bit wonky without enhaning your aim abilities, but for those worried stealth is really well done and feels fair. Nothing beats hacking a turret into killing the guards for you though. "

												Deus Ex is a classic of gaming, often considered the greatest PC game of all time. While I would give Thief II that honor, it's not hard to see why this game tops so many ""best of"" lists, and it's one of my personal favorites. This game may also be one of the best examples of why you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover, as it looks like absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ with freaky-looking human models, blocky levels, barf-inducing textures, and subpar voice acting. However, if you can get past all that, you'll quickly find that this game is something special. Deus Ex appears to be an FPS on the surface, but it's really an FPS-RPG. Throughout the game you acquire skill points that you can use to upgrade your skill with certain weapon types (pistol, rifle, heavy, etc.) You can use any weapon you find and have room for, but to be even remotely competent with them, you'll have to upgrade the respective skill, which increases damage and accuracy, and occasionally adds some other benefits. There are also other skills you can upgrade, such as Computer, which allows you to hack ATMs for money and security terminals to deactivate cameras and reprogram turrets, and Lockpicking, which decreases the amount of disposable lockpicks you need to open a door. The great thing about Deus Ex is that there is no one correct way to play the game. Every skill in the game, with the exception of Swimming and arguably Environmental Training, is useful, and there is a way to beat any mission with any skillset. You could use Multitools to bypass a security keypad to open a door, or you could hack a security terminal and open it from there, or you could lockpick your way into a drawer with a datacube containing the code, or you could just blow the door open with an explosive. There is always more than one way to solve a problem, something that is very, very rare in even the best games out there. The amount of depth this game has amazes me. Once I was in a high-rise apartment, and I decided to break the window and jump out, merely for the entertainment of seeing how far up I actually was. I instead landed on a balcony, lockpicking my way into a room with binoculars and a computer terminal containing interesting details about the lore of the game. My jaw was literally agape. I could not believe that such an obscure location would actually have something noteworthy in it. No matter how many times you play Deus Ex, you will always find something new, be it a new way to complete a mission or just a fun easter egg, and this makes the replay value extremely high. The game is massive, and I believe this to be in part due to the extremely low-budget graphics. Since so little time and money was spent on the look of the game, the mechanics could be polished to a mirror shine and the world expanded in a meaningful way, with things to find in every nook and cranny. I would also be remiss not to mention the game's fantastic story. It's a wonder the game managed to be so compelling despite the awful voice acting, and it speaks to the quality of the writing that this was achieved. The characters you encounter are lovable, and the overarching plot is both extremely complex and full of twists and turns, which is why, in the interest of avoiding spoilers and laziness, I won't be providing a plot summary. You'll just have to find out for yourself. Lastly, there is the music, which is phenomenal. Alexander Brandon's compositions are varied, memorable, and always fit the location and the themes of the story (edit: I derped, there are two other composers as well, named Michiel van den Bos and Daniel Gardopee). On top of that, the music isn't just nice to listen to: they also serve a gameplay purpose. During the missions, the music that plays will normally be very ambient and fade into the background, but when enemies are alerted of your prescense (this game has optional stealth), the music will become more intense, not only to change the mood from that of quiet sneaking to fast-paced gunplay, but also to let you know the enemies are on to you even if you're too far away to see or hear them. The rest of the sound design is solid, with satisfying gun noises that make shooting satisfying if you have to get into a fight. The only sound that isn't good is the sound of assault rifle bullets hitting a wall, which is utterly dreadful. It sounds more like rain hitting the ground than bullets colliding with solid steel, and it takes you out of the intensity of combat. Overall, Deus Ex's presentation has some problems, but the overall package is one of the deepest, most complex and most fun games ever made, and it also has the advantage of being utterly unique. No other game is quite like Deus Ex and few are as well-designed and compelling.10/10P.S. If you're a newbie and you want to play this game for the first time, I highly reccomend downloading this mod for the game:http://www.moddb.com/mods/biomodIt makes several balance changes to the game, ranging from small changes like buffing some of the melee weapon's damage, to massive overhauls, like replacing the useless Swimming skill with the very useful Atheltics skill, which increases speed and jump height on land as well as in water. There are also some new additions, like the ability to do a Thief-style wall mount if you upgrade your Athletics skill to Advanced, the ability to pickpocket keys from guards, and white phosphorus grenades. Additionally, the game runs smoother, saves take less time, the game autosaves when maps change, and overall it's a straight upgrade from the unmodded version. It'll help take the edge off some of the ways in which this game shows it's age.

												игрушка шикарная, затянула с первого уровня.упоротый сюжет по канонам рен-тв, но его развилки не в середине игры, как в последнем ведьмаке, например, а на последнем уровне. Действия влияют только на сложность прохождения. В отличие от Human Revolution, можно избежать битв с боссами - от некоторых можно убежать, пару можно взорвать без драки. Проходить можно разными способами и иногда даже не такими, которые предусмотрели разработчики. Финалы заставляют призадуматься о судьбе человечества (считаю правильной концовку, предложенную Трейсером Тонгом). Интересно, что первые уровни Human Revolution и некоторые пасхалки частично слизаны с этой игры.заметил особенность - атмосфера тайных лабораторий намного лучше передана в Half-Life, вышедшей на два года раньше. Может, в халве лучше дизайн или более подходящая музыка. В Deus Ex постоянное музыкальное сопровождение, тишины нет. Динамичная музыка, играющая во время сражения, должна предупреждать игрока о том, что его заметили, и в загадочных местах с неведомыми тварями она оказывается лишней. Понравилась музыка на рынке Гонконга, в штабе UNATCO и офисе Versalife.Пока игра нравится больше Human Revolution, которую я не осилил несколько лет назад.			"

												I don't want the hype to throw you back when playing Deus Ex. Already when it was release, there were complains about optimization (I think people where not aware of how much is handled in the background in this game), animations, ""boss"" battles, and some boredom you might get in the final levels. It is still the best game I have ever played (would it too much to have original Deus Ex with the engine of Mankind??? I doubt it but well see FF7). I mean, I played it two times and there were things I never thought of, like that famous killswitch!I dont like this version because I got used to gamepad nowadays, so it is a pity we cannot have the ps2 version. If you like deus ex HR and retro 3D games, if you love to reload a section just to see if you can pass it in a different way, if you like emerging gameplay, Deus Ex is your game.			"

Approximate hours spent since February 2001: 800-1500h+Nano-augmented agents will often encounter stress created by resentment among fellow agents, particularly those who have been mechanically augmented. In an effort to secure freedom and liberty for those under their protection, many UNATCO agents have chosen to sacrifice social acceptance for mission performance by surgically replacing limbs and organs with mechanically or electronically enhanced equivalents. But your nano-augmentations points the way to the future: thousands of microscopic, living, organic machines that exist in symbiosis with your body.Because such augmentations create only minimal disfigurement, they are likely to be a source of friction between you and other mechanically augmented agents -- but it is important to understand that UNATCO is an organization where individuals must act in concert. Each is important to the whole, and mutual understanding is essential to teams comprised of diverse human and augmentedagents. If you have any further questions or wish to discuss these issues, please feel free to send email to CarverEschells\\UNATCO.4352.768 to make an appointment.And welcome to UNATCO, agent.			"

												This classic, formative RPG is a great deal of fun and should not be missed by any fans of the genre. Sure, everything about it is dated; this is to be expected, given that it was released in 2000. The game's appeal isn't to be found in the graphics or the sound, or whatever else you might find archaic about it, but rather in the brilliant, immersive story and the pure importance that the game held for the future of the genre. Buy it; you'll have a good time, provided that you manage to be patient through the first hour or so.			"

												This game is so awesome because i love it when games talk about conspiracies.  This whole game is set on conspiracies which is awesome.  This game is one of the best action/rpgs game out there.  It is hard but not frustrating.  The story is really well done and the voice acting is crazy good for being an older game.  The stealth is great and works which many newer games don't get right.  It brings up alot of conspiracies that are still being talked about today.  Great game to play and have multiple endings so it has good replay value.			"

												It's too deep for a traditional review.This game is massive, it has more depth and complexity than any game nowadays could hope to produce under a AAA title because publishers or whomever expect all this shiny new graphics and need everything drenched in that hideous Hollywood syrupy formula.This game pulls no punches and unfortunately represents a failure in the industry because we will never return to this level of passion and drive, even its sequels, although good(great even) cannot stand up to it.IF you can get past the graphics and the uncanny valley character movements and the engine bugs then you will enjoy this game, if you like the setting I actually cannot see how you could not enjoy it.So lets just give it a thumbs up and leave it there eh?

												This classic, formative RPG is a great deal of fun and should not be missed by any fans of the genre. Sure, everything about it is dated; this is to be expected, given that it was released in 2000. The game's appeal isn't to be found in the graphics or the sound, or whatever else you might find archaic about it, but rather in the brilliant, immersive story and the pure importance that the game held for the future of the genre. Buy it; you'll have a good time, provided that you manage to be patient through the first hour or so.			"

												For something released in 2000, this game is absolutely exceptional. From the moment you start playing, you get to choose your own playstyle. It doesn't matter if you prefer sniping enemies from far away, stealthily sneaking past people, or running around with guns blazing. You do what you want to do. The story and gameplay are great too. The only thing I must critique is the controls that span from 1-0 and F1-F12. You're gonna have to get used to sometimes taking your right hand off of your mouse and moving it back quickly to press a button. Anyhow, I feel this game is definitely worth more than $9.99.			"

												Perhaps my second favourite game of all time (right behind Starcraft). Deus Ex is a superb mix of RPG and FPS that allows you to play how you want to play. Do you want to go in hot, with guns a-blazing? Then go right ahead. Do you want to skulk and strike from the shadows? Go for it. Do you just want to avoid any and all contact with enemies and live in peace as a pacifist? You can do that too. With nearly unlimited ways to play, and a 20-30 hour campaign with a very good story, Deus Ex is definitely worth the $9.99.			"

I must have played it for the first time half a decade after it was released, and it hadn't aged well.Yes I realise it was revolutionary in narrative, gameplay and design.But personally.I found the voice acting laughably bad, the combat clunky, the game design questionable (lol laser sword), and overall found it rather dull.I'm sure if I played it when I was still a babby in 2000 I'd probably love the game, but I don't, it was a real struggle to finish.

The games ability to make the gameplay the way you want it, be it stealth, or hacking into computers and turning turrets against their allies or simply being a tank, the combination of skills and augs makes the variations endless.

												This game is timeless in that it will forever be one of the greatest games...for all of eternity.Worst part was when it ended. Enough said.In all seriousness, though, it brings so many positives to the table that I would be hard pressed to think of any negatives.A FPS with abilities (nanotechnology), an inventory system, an immersive storyline with multiple endings, all packaged up with an affordable price tag...what's not to love?Especially with the new Deus Ex about to come out, be sure to pick this up if you haven't already. Some people say to buy whatever game when it's on sale. From how much I've enjoyed this game, along with the nearly countless other positive reviewers that would most likely agree with me, I'd say that even if this game doubled in price, it'd still be a steal.

The story is sort of all over the place and requers your attention to understand the small details.

												Here's an example of a great game that didn't age well. While nothing can take away its cult status and its place in the pantheon of gaming, actually playing it today is a pain. The interface is less than convenient. The upgrade system is cryptic, as you never know in advance which skills or augmentations you are going to use, and which are a waste of resources. The levels are huge, dark, labyrinthine, with lots of ladders and passages hidden in plain sight and no minimap or quest markers so you are guranteed to wander them for hours, not sure where exactly you are supposed to go. The gameplay is clunky, as the game isn't sure whether it wants to be an RPG, a shooter or a stealth action, making every play style equally hard to enjoy.However, all of this is worth enduring, especially if you are not just a regular gamer, but a game journalist, blogger or developer. Deus Ex provides a level of story detail that is rarely seen in a game even today, serving as an example of what this medium can achieve and provivding the hints on how to do it. The games tells a great, dark and mature story in a way that only this medium can: through your own actions, and the whole world around you. All the scattered books and newspapers, cracked emails, overheared dialogues create a grim world and a tight story like no linear medium, be it a book or a movie, ever could. The game is highly sensitive to your beavior too, providing feedback on tiniest of actions that sometimes echo through the story for far longer than you would expect. In the modern day this game might be hard to enjoy for those who play for pleasure, but if you want to understand how the videogames tick, it is an absolute must-play.			"

												THIS GAME HAS BALLS!- game predicted 9/11- you can kill childrens- game criticizes the European UnionNow seriously:I started playing this game only after finishing Human Revolution and......I understood why people called this game legendary.These days many games turn off player's thinking (what a shame), I was pleasantly surprised that game allowed me for killing importants story characters and making other unpredictable actions - non-linearity is a huge advantage of this game!Game has amazing atmosphere and dialogues which invite me to reflections.Soundtrack is epic! (UNATCO theme ♥)The only downside is voice acting but in some way it adds charm, and makes some moments memorable. I wanted good game, It gave me perfect one.			"

												It's a good old game and one of the best games ever, yawn.Anyway the graphics are pretty bad now. The controls are too (fixable).The game is based around you having special abilities, but none of them are special, they're usually of the ""deal more damage"", ""take less damage"" type. Enemies are completely oblivious to their surroundings. The stealth choice has no upsides except on the first level. There's quite a bit walking to do in the game too. Shooting precisely is based on standing still for a while (5+ seconds).The setting is great but the story of the game itself is pretty bad, completely revealed to you at the end of the first level.If you have a hard on for classic games, sure get it..

												The popularly accepted theory that Jazz stemmed from a simple combination of African rhythms and European harmony is in need of a little revision. Both African and European rhythms were employed. African music supplied the strong underlying beat (absent in most European music), the use of polyrhythms, and the idea of playing the melody separate from or above the beat. European music provided formal dance rhythms. Combined, these rhythms give Jazz its' characteristic swing. Likewise, the harmonies and musical ideas of both continents are present, the blue notes derived from the pentatonic scale, ""call and response"" and unconventional instrumental timbres of African music together with ""conventional"" harmonies and, most important, the formal structure of European music. The multiplicity of ethnic, cultural and musical conditions needed to spawn Jazz was thus unique to the United States, and specifically to New Orleans. The necessary philosophical impetus for Jazz, i.e. , democracy and freedom of individual expression supported by group interaction, are also American institutions.  "

												Here's an example of a great game that didn't age well. While nothing can take away its cult status and its place in the pantheon of gaming, actually playing it today is a pain. The interface is less than convenient. The upgrade system is cryptic, as you never know in advance which skills or augmentations you are going to use, and which are a waste of resources. The levels are huge, dark, labyrinthine, with lots of ladders and passages hidden in plain sight and no minimap or quest markers so you are guranteed to wander them for hours, not sure where exactly you are supposed to go. The gameplay is clunky, as the game isn't sure whether it wants to be an RPG, a shooter or a stealth action, making every play style equally hard to enjoy.However, all of this is worth enduring, especially if you are not just a regular gamer, but a game journalist, blogger or developer. Deus Ex provides a level of story detail that is rarely seen in a game even today, serving as an example of what this medium can achieve and provivding the hints on how to do it. The games tells a great, dark and mature story in a way that only this medium can: through your own actions, and the whole world around you. All the scattered books and newspapers, cracked emails, overheared dialogues create a grim world and a tight story like no linear medium, be it a book or a movie, ever could. The game is highly sensitive to your beavior too, providing feedback on tiniest of actions that sometimes echo through the story for far longer than you would expect. In the modern day this game might be hard to enjoy for those who play for pleasure, but if you want to understand how the videogames tick, it is an absolute must-play.			"

Let me put it this way:You've got your the-greates, the-best game, with great storyline? And it is not Deus Ex? So you're wrong. Just play Deus Ex and you will change your mind.Plot twist - it may look like FPS but really it is hybrid of thief/hitman and RPG game, just with first-person look. If you loved Half Life just know, that in Deus Ex SHOOTING IS JUST OPTIONAL. "

												Deus Ex: Game of the Year Edition is an FPS RPG and was released in 2000. Although the graphics were even dated back then, the game is liked by its fans for the story and the great open maps. The game is set in an universe where all conspiracy theories are true...+ Multiple paths to choose. Depend on your skills, too. + skill and augmentation tree+ Unique soundtrack+ A lot of weapons to choose from.+ My boss told me to stay out of the ladies restroom.+ Good level design+ iconic game- Unmodded state is unplayable. Works well with the right mods though.- Although fans love the story, I didn't, really. It has just too many conspiracy theories.- The game felt a bit too long. Didn't help that some maps are not memorable.- The protagonist is a conspiracy theorist. Therefore, his dialogue is stupid.- Some of the worst voice acting I have ever seen.- Some skills and augmentations are useless.- Stealth is feasible, but hard. If you don't know the maps yet anyway. Overall, the stealth mechanics aren't well developped.- The AI is badI'd recommend playing this game if you have ever played older games before and want to know why the game is loved by many. Since the game is really old by now, it's only playable on modern hardware if you download and install the following things: the kentie.net exe, a directx 10 (or 9 if you want to) and texture mods like new vision and maybe HDTP.Replay value: Potentially high with multiple choices, paths, endings and changed dialogueRating: 8.0/10Recommendation: Yes			"

												Graphics: the graphics were okish for 2000 when the game released. To bring it this century, follow this guide: http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ceuyh/step_by_step_moddingguide_deus_ex_i_spilled_my/Sound: nice voice overs, decent sound fx. Overall very atmospheric, if a bit low fidelity.Gameplay: good. The controls and interface are a bit clunky compared to what you may be used to but after 1-2 hours it stops getting in the way. The customization of your character is really meaningful with choices that are not just skin deep. However, there is no way to screw things up, the game can be completed without any items and with any build.Story: knocks your socks off. This game has real choice and consequence, plot twists, cospiracy theories melded together very smartly and, something that rarely happens nowadays: a great ending. Hard to explain without spoiling anything, but I think this is one of the best game stories of all time and it's the main reason you would want to play this game. There are usually about 3-5 ways to accomplish any objective and combat itself is optional (although sometimes combat is the easiest way to reach objectives).How to approach: the game doesn't have a compass/objective pointers, doesn't show your position on the map and generally does not hold your hand. Pay attentiona and have a faq at hand if you get stuck (but try to play on your own, it's more fun like that).			"

Alas, alas they lost! Weep for these lost souls, these many homeless, swept into the great dustbin of history!Deus Ex re-imagines the Luddite movement and brings it forward into a more modern context. In it, you play J.C. Denton, a man who finds himself leading the revolution against the neo-spinning jennys and the cyber-Jacquard looms, advanced textile machines that use cutting edge nanotechnology to greatly improve the output of the textile mills of Neo-England.

												You know, I first played this game when I was 14, in 2001. I liked it a lot then, but thought the graphics looked a bit outdated. Even for the time it was released, it was by no means a graphical triumph. Believe me, when I say the graphics haven't aged well, you can take that as a bonafide fact. If you don't believe me, you'll see what I mean when you get it. However, as I said, the graphics were never particularly grand in the first place. It would be nice if resolutions were fixed for more modern systems, even though this would take some time. I'm not asking for a complete reboot or remake of the game, just make the higher resolutions actually WORK - which they don't. Again, though, graphics shouldn't be considered a selling point in a game from 15 years ago - it's just a minor gripe. Unlike the graphics from many games of this era like any of the games from the Quake, Unreal, or Half Life Series, they haven't aged well.I realize my playtime here on Steam is extremely low (though my playtime otherwise has been much higher), but feelings of Nostalgia came screaming back to me as I started it up. After just a few minutes of playtime, I remembered. You should never hit a TNT box with a crowbar, no matter how good of an idea it may seem at the time. Oh, the hilarity. I'm glad that a lot of gameplay elements I saw for the first time in Deus Ex have stayed with games into the modern era, and I believe that as one goes into this, if they've been a gamer for practically their whole lives, or even new gamers, should take a look at things that probably started with this game and continued. The actual implementation of stealth in this game is pretty good, albeit somewhat clunky and kind of clumsy - however, it has been taken and run with into modern games. I'm not saying this is the only game to have done this, certainly Metal Gear Solid for the Playstation console did a great job of it as well, but Deus Ex did it slightly differently. The combination of the two has endured. The game isn't very hard, but it's not easy either, and maybe it's my poor eyesight, but I did need to crank up the brighteness of the game a good bit to see what I was doing. The voice acting for the time period was great, and they caught that ""Matrix"" vibe that I liked about the game the first time I played. In short, I can understand why opinions are divided on this game and have been since it came out, I personally think it's great and enjoyable, and you get out of it what you put into it, but some people think it sucks. With Deus Ex, it comes down to either loving it or hating it - I haven't really seen anyone with an in-between opinion on it that's played it. It either rules or it sucks, take your pick. If you played it in the past and want Nostalgia, definitely check it out, but don't expect anything to be more brilliant or prettier than it was in the past, because that's just not how it is. My only major complaint? The screen resolutions don't work correctly. This is irritating and really the only detriment to playing the game again in order to feel like a kid while I'm not currently working. For 6.99? Certainly worth the price, even if you're just a completist. 8/10 for innovation, storyline, gameplay, and cyberpunk style-over-substance healthy dose of cool.5/10 for graphics. Fix the resolutions, other than that, it will never be a graphical triumph, but you'll be able to tolerate it if you like cyberpunk visuals.			"

												Many people have lauded Deus Ex as one of the greatest games ever created, and by fockin' Bunne, they should! Ion Storm never had a ""pristine rep"", but what they did with Deus Ex wasn't just brilliant... it was DIVINE! Any game which lets players choose ENTIRELY how to play it is a game worthy of several bonus points in MY book! The stealth is a bit woinky and unreliable at times, in the sense that it's hard to know when someone's looking at you or not. But that's probably just part of the appeal. The weapon modding makes combat VERY interesting, as you can turn a simple 10mm pistol into a miniature sniper rifle, and you can turn a shotgun into an armour-wrecking monster of anti-bottery. Basically, it's hard to pin-point what exactly it is about Deus Ex that makes it such an amazingly brilliant game, without just going all broad and generic by saying ""everything"" and leaving it at that. But weirdly, that's probably the best answer you'll get outta anyone that's spent any amount o' time with it. 9.7/10			"

												The story is fantastic and has strong ties to the real world. The feeling that what your doing actually matters for your story line (even if it is limited) makes it so great. Graphics are aesthetically pleasing. Sound work is great.But the gameplay is a bit lacking. AI are a bit stoogey like they tend to be in stealth games so that you can actually do stealth, but they also have trouble putting up a fight against a real human who can figure out how to take advantage of their weaknesses and its not very hard to do it. Once you realize you can bunny hop everywhere with the dragon sword and win just about every fight you realize the gameplay isn't incredibly strong here. But doing that is fairly fun and enjoyable, but considering how difficult guns can be to use in terms of accuracy and damage it almost seems to easy and a design oversight. Theres enough variance in enemies to keep it fresh and with some enemies the sword trick isn't really going to work and its a better idea to just avoid them altogether and there are points where the sword trick will not work at all but these are generally short lived and not common.GET THE SWORD, GET THE SWORD, AND OH RIGHT....GET THE ♥♥♥♥ING SWORD. Even if the the base gameplay design in terms of shootouts and weapons are good to decent you have alot of choices to take ranging from no kills to straight stealth.  You decide how to play the game and thats really rare and makes up for all the short comings.Its a great game and stands out from the crowd. Its a bit of a shame that if you want to go with a straight guns route that its not as rewarding and more work than just bunny hopping around with the sword and face stabbing people.Its still a great game though. Totally worth a playthrough.			"

												Deus Ex is a gameplay-driven story and it's probably the closest video games will ever come to being a movie without sacrificing the gameplay. Well, Deus Ex and Metal Gear Solid, too. You play as a guy named Deus. Deus likes wearing sunglasses indoors at night time because he's a pretentious prick who just wants to look cool. You'll grow to like him anyway though because he has funny one-liners and tells a stripper to get a real job. Deus works a globalist anti-terrorist organization. This seems cool and all, but remember: GLOBALIST!!!!!Your organization is being funded by George Soros, but it's the distant future where Hillary Clinton won and everyone hates George Soros by now, so he calls himself ""Bob Page"". George Soros has been making some kind of virus that makes people♥♥♥♥♥♥their intestines out, but he's also been manufacturing the cure and selling it to the elites. He's fabricating conflicts and and outbreaks in order to necessitate a reliance on the government and establish a Globalist society. Deus thinks George Soros is a pretty cool guy, but then Alex Jones blows up the Statue of Liberty and tells him that George Soros is the REAL TERRORIST!!!!!Deus still hasn't made up his mind at this point, but the story gets pretty crazy. I mean, George Soros hooks himself up to this machine thing and becomes this robot god with some blue stuff all over his body. Deus goes through a bunch of 90's SciFi movie sets while cool robot music plays in the background. Check it out.The gameplay isn't really about shooting things, it's more about sneaking around and using the environment to your advantage. It's not really a puzzle as much as it is a problem. You got multiple solutions to everything. You gotta use your brain and manipulate the mechanics to get to the next area. It's really a game you have to ""understand"" to actually play.Really fun, actually one of my all-time favorites. Only people who don't like it are SammyClassicSonicFan and the Globalists.			"

												I honestly don't know how to describe Deus Ex. Its sorta like a mix between Skyrim and Half-Life, its almost its own genre. The game plays like an RPG but the stages are built like Half-Life, its very unique and the only way to see what i meen is to play it for yourself. Its also aged very well and still holds up to this day. If your a fan of late 90s early 2000s PC games Deus Ex is a must buy.			"

												I have 3 main problems with this game that make it borderline un playable.1.) Its to freaking dark! I can turn the brightness way up but then everthing just looks terrible. So I have a choice between not seeing anything and hurting my eyes or everything looking terrible.2.) The whole, your cursor has to stay over the enemy to increase your accruacy is just annoying. I do not like that mechanic in the slightest.3.) There is no point to stealth. I play a lot of stealth games and I love stealth. There really isnt any reason to here. You can blast someone away with rockets and space lasers and the guy standing 2 feet away wouldnt even notice.If you can get past that then there is a pretty good game here. It has quite a few ways to complete missions. Lots of stuff to explore and figure out. And you can kill just about anyone.This isn't a game where I can sit down and play through it in big chunks. Its going to be one of those I play an hour of it on the weekends until its over type deals.I still recomend the game if the issues above dont bother you or you can get it on sale. As far as bugs and such go, I have not seen any.			"

I watched a review and the dude said that calling this game perfection is an insult. So yeah I highly recomment this game and it probably runs on any pc.			"

												One of the best games of all time.  The atmosphere, the music, and the way in which the story is presented is like no other.  If you simply play through the game without exploring, you'll only get about 5% of the story (made up number, but you know what I mean).  This is a game that will warrant many playthroughs.  Prior to this Steam version, I've played the game over a dozen times.			"

UPDATE:If you purchase/obtain this game or own it on Steam without the patch, please download the free Deus Ex: REVISION mod available from Steam. It upgrades the graphics, makes the textures MUCH higher-resolution, fixes bugs, and generally and specifically in other ways makes Deus Ex a much more modern experience without removing the charm of the original game. Even old-timers like me appreciate the improvements and those younger gamers who can't stomach the old graphics or controls of the original game will find DX:REVISION much more palatable. Yeah, there's still text to read. Yeah, there are still more ways to complete each level than you're probably thought of yet. Yeah, this depicts a future time when all conspiracy theories are part of reality, just like the original DX did. The only thing that would make it better without a complete rewrite is the original fold-out paper pack-ins from the boxed game.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Some people in 2011 have a problem with DX from 2000 because it used the Unreal 1 engine and the sky/ground textures are low-resolution. I didn't have a problem with that because, if I were playing as if I were JC Denton, I wouldn't waste time looking at distant city lights mapped onto the skybox. Having them visible at all was a bonus.I thought it was awesome; I've played through it many, many times since the first release. I still hear the Hong Kong music in my head when I think about it because I've spent so many hours over the years running back and forth through that portion of the game. Heh. After I got a 3DFX card and was able to see the 3D-accelerated version's enhanced effects (Ooh! Shiny floors at UNATCO HQ, and I can play in a higher res than 320x240 / 512x384!), replaying was just that much more fun! Choosing different paths, favoring different factions, playing to the different endings, etc., gave DX a LOT of replayability, and the game is never too long!			"

												This is an old review for the game that I first played 10 years ago and I lost count how many times I have complete it since after.For a 10 year old game, the graphic certainly don't stand up, however the level design, the attention to detail is more advanced than any current game in existence.The story and the narrative are terrifying depressing... and more terrifying is that they are becoming real, this game came out before 9/11, before the era of terrorism, before the rise of China, before the mass inequality, before the mass surveillance of the world today... but yet... all of those themes were very heavy in the world of Deus Ex, and everything is slowly becoming real.The only thing that is lacking in today's world which the game have is the conspiracy stuff... but how knows, maybe that is real as well and we just don't know it. (Illuminati if you are really out there, please don't kill me or publish my browser history)For people that never played this game, I would recommend download some HD mods for this game, and have patience to at least get out of New York level, if you can do that, you will get use to the game play, and rest of the game magic will do it self.

												I honestly don't know how to describe Deus Ex. Its sorta like a mix between Skyrim and Half-Life, its almost its own genre. The game plays like an RPG but the stages are built like Half-Life, its very unique and the only way to see what i meen is to play it for yourself. Its also aged very well and still holds up to this day. If your a fan of late 90s early 2000s PC games Deus Ex is a must buy.			"

												I have 3 main problems with this game that make it borderline un playable.1.) Its to freaking dark! I can turn the brightness way up but then everthing just looks terrible. So I have a choice between not seeing anything and hurting my eyes or everything looking terrible.2.) The whole, your cursor has to stay over the enemy to increase your accruacy is just annoying. I do not like that mechanic in the slightest.3.) There is no point to stealth. I play a lot of stealth games and I love stealth. There really isnt any reason to here. You can blast someone away with rockets and space lasers and the guy standing 2 feet away wouldnt even notice.If you can get past that then there is a pretty good game here. It has quite a few ways to complete missions. Lots of stuff to explore and figure out. And you can kill just about anyone.This isn't a game where I can sit down and play through it in big chunks. Its going to be one of those I play an hour of it on the weekends until its over type deals.I still recomend the game if the issues above dont bother you or you can get it on sale. As far as bugs and such go, I have not seen any.			"

												Everyone already knows Deus Ex 1 is a near perfect game that still outdoes modern games including all the sequels.  I don't know who would look at reviews here considering the game's pedigree but if you are looking at this just buy the game. Deus Ex very fun and hugely replayable, the level design itself which allows many playstyles is still ahead of modern RPGs, let alone how characters react to what you have done before.Buy Deus Ex. Buy it for a friend. Buy it for your family. Buy a second copy. Just keep buying it because it deserves all the sales it can get. Deus Ex 1 is simply a phenominal masterpiece.			"

												I was at a part where I had to infiltrate a hanger and find some stolen medicine/cures on a plane and the area. I got to the plane and my characters brother tells me he's joined the other side, that it's safe to approach the plane. explains briefly that he's got proof that the government is behind everything. That I should go talk to the guy I'm supposed to arrest in the plane. So I go in talk to him and my partner comes in and orders me to shoot him. I ignore Her and keep talking to him. I want to find out what he knows Right. So I keep interrogating him he starts telling me about my parents that I'm a test tube baby and so on. My partner She starts to get REALLY upset, and says I'm disobeying orders. I still keep talking to the so called "" Terrorist"" about the government and then bam she shoots him and says he was trying to run. I Immediately Shoot her, and we have a little shoot out but I blow her up into pieces. and regret nothing. Then my tech dude at HQ who saw everything says he will erase the logs and cover for me. Tho I think they are starting to suspect I'm up to something as I've been knocked out, and thrown in jail and am now breaking out.Great Game			"

												I think Deus Ex is a good game, overall. Your charachter is highly customizable gameplay-wise, allowing you to get past your enemies in whatever fasion you desire (usualy). You can become a walking tank with maxed out weapons skills and biceps full of combat nanites, a silent assassin who is deadly with blade and pistol and can turn invisible, or just about anything else you think up. The storyline is fairly decent, and has some deep overarching themes. However, Deus Ex isn't some sinless saint. The game feels too long, especialy for one where there are so many methods to try out. I lost intrest about 3 missions away from the ending. There are also encounters with other augumented people which always seemed one-directional to me. They're immune to everything non-lethal, and they soak up bullets without missing a step. The only way I found to kill them was to just blow them up. Explosives in this game seem a bit overpowered too, since they basicly kill everything within 30 feet that has line of sight. Despite these flaws, Deus Ex is most definately worth 7 bucks. I know a few  tripple-A games with the same quality going for $60.			"

												Deus Ex was one of the very few games I went into without knowing a THING about it.When i first got into it I really didn't think i would've gotten myself immersed into right away due to the age, but holy jesus was I wrong!  Deus Ex was made by a company known as Ion Storm ,Yes the same people who made Daikatana, and to come from that to this beauty of a game is amazing, The graphics are dated sure, but the audio design and music REALLY keep it up to today's standards. Coming from a game made in 2000 the voice acting is really good, even down right hilarious at times when the jokes pop up and the music, GOODNESS the music! its something that really takes my 1st place surpassing that of Doom.The mixture of Techno and classical is a beautiful combonation that everyone should listen too! from the high-tech offices of UNATCO to the desolate streets of a worn-down Paris, it all sounds so pleasing to your ears. Now, down to the real meat of this game, the Story (no spoilers) and Gameplay.  Deus Ex's story is handsdown one of the best I have experienced in a long time, rivaling that of Half-Life 2. the Multi-Choice endings are perfect on how it makes the player feel with the end result. the game can even let you kill off most of the story-important NPCS right off the bat and it seems like the whole story shifts around your actions. Dont expect a short playthrough with this game either, it took me a good 24 hours to beat it while looking in all of the corners of the maps to find secrets and hidden areas.  Gameplay wise, Deus Ex is a great experience, the combat system is totally unique and intuitive and the Inventory system is done really well and the Nano-augs you can get really shift on how you build your character and progress through the game.  the Skills system is a bit basic sure, but it will make you choose which you feel is more important, and trust me putting it all into Pistols and Rifles is something you DO NOT want to do first thing with each level offering on how efficient your character uses said items. It's always best to put points into the skills that help you rack up more ammo and supplies.In ConclusionDeus Ex is a down right masterpiece and it down right deserves to be called the ""Greatest PC game of all time"" in my books, everything about this game is done so right and if one can mod it so it works with modern machines, your in for one heck of a good time!

												This game should be on any sci-fi fan's obligatory to-play list.This it how it was done back in the day, huge levels, a lot of levels, you really got your money's worth.So many games today feel cramped, have checkpoint saves and are played through in a few hours.Sure it's showing its age a little bit, but i'd rather take old and awesome before those graphics showcases that pose as games these days.

												I think Deus Ex is a good game, overall. Your charachter is highly customizable gameplay-wise, allowing you to get past your enemies in whatever fasion you desire (usualy). You can become a walking tank with maxed out weapons skills and biceps full of combat nanites, a silent assassin who is deadly with blade and pistol and can turn invisible, or just about anything else you think up. The storyline is fairly decent, and has some deep overarching themes. However, Deus Ex isn't some sinless saint. The game feels too long, especialy for one where there are so many methods to try out. I lost intrest about 3 missions away from the ending. There are also encounters with other augumented people which always seemed one-directional to me. They're immune to everything non-lethal, and they soak up bullets without missing a step. The only way I found to kill them was to just blow them up. Explosives in this game seem a bit overpowered too, since they basicly kill everything within 30 feet that has line of sight. Despite these flaws, Deus Ex is most definately worth 7 bucks. I know a few  tripple-A games with the same quality going for $60.			"

												Deus Ex: GotYE is a fundamentally great game! I don't want to even tell you what you can do. If you like the new deus ex and thought it was to short or to unforgiving for shooting-styled gameplay, if you like the thief-series or the gameplay of Dishonored than please try this game. I know the graphics didn't age that well, but they still function very well regarding the gameplay. Animations are also very clunky, Audio is very minimalistic and voice acting could feel a bit off. Anyway: I encourage to play the Deus Ex: Revision version which is available here on steam for 0€ if you own this version. It got all bugs covered(afaik) and adds some great details as well as achievements for all achievement hunters out there! "

												Just one of those games that truly defines the PC gaming platform.Deus Ex raised the bar for many standards on how games should be. With it's nonlinear style of gameplay allowing you to finish missions in many different ways, to it's vast customization, amazing story and various gameplay elements, Deus Ex is simply a masterpiece. Looking at it today, if you can get past the hilarious voice acting and it's bad graphics (there are mods that fix the graphical issues), you'll find one of the best games ever made. If you've never played the game before, imagine yourself in the year 2000, most of the games you've played past this point probably don't exist. Then after you're finished, you'll realize how large of an impact Deus Ex has made in modern gaming. That's how I feel this game should be experienced. This game might not make as huge of an impression to today's gamers who mainly play modern games so I feel that they do decide to play this, that's the way it should be done.9.5/10, an absolute classic and one of my personal favorites.

												Well, its a FPS with RPG elements, but that isn't really its main appeal. Its main appeal in my opinion is simply in the ways you can interact with people in the game. For example there is a part where you are ordered to kill someone and you have 3 choices. You can kill the person you were ordered to, you can kill the person ordering you to kill, or you can choose to kill neither. You can even go about dealing with enemies however you want. You can kill every enemy with bullets or explosions, you can avoid enemies using stealth, or you can non lethally take them all down. The game likes to give you a lot of options like that, so that every playthrough will feel a little different.			"

												Most of the positives and negatives of this game have been posted for years, but for me, what makes the original Deus Ex stand up against most is the way the narrative is handled. Not only is there conspiracies and plot twists, but the underlying thread of AI and cyberpunk philosophy still speaks to some of our uncertainities as it did in 2000. Sure the graphics look horrid, even with mods and the voice acting is very spooty, but the gameplay still holds up for me. Even now there's always 1-2 things I find in playthroughs that I missed before.Really love this game and would still recommend it for people that love narrative-driven RPGs.			"

												Although I prefer System Shock 2 over Deus Ex after all, I can't recommend this epic cyberpunk adventure enough. The plot with all its twists is more than convincing, the music top-notch (who doesn't love the Hong Kong Streets theme?) and the possibilites of augmentations more than numerous.Some gameplay mechanics (like knocking down enemies with the baton) aren't as smooth as in other games from the same era (Thief), but either way you shouldn't miss this classic. After the good ending flickered on your screen, you won't regret getting this game!			"

												Probably the finest game ever created.  Deus Ex is a conspiracy-driven, atmospheric first-person RPG title with remarkable story across a stunning array of locations from New York to Hong Kong. You play JC Denton; an American Special Agent stuck in a corrupt world of terrorists, disease and economic carnage. The game introduces itself in Liberty Island, New York where the city has been infected by a man-made virus set to wipe out the underclasses. Terrorists have hijacked a shipment of highly sought-after vaccine which has sent Manhattan into meltdown as people drop dead as they surrender their lives to the virus. As you begin your quest to restore order; you have to find the people who were behind the attack but also determine who and what caused the disease and more importantly why... 13 years on; this game outshines even the most ambitious modern day titles. The script is phenomenal, the characters are memorable and intriguing and the music is some of the best seen in a videogame. This is not a linear title either; you have considerable control in your actions with many various ways to complete objectives and affect outcomes.  This concept is largely unseen in today's bland offerings. The inventory system is simple but smart and ensures tough decisions on what you can carry. The XP points and augmentations can improve your character's abilities from hacking computers to general combat and movement. The RPG elements are extremely well implemented in this game and the interface is very user friendly.  The combat mechanics may feel a little ropey and dated but the positives outweigh anything negative you may notice.At any price; this game is worth getting as it stands tall against even the most elite games of this generation.  One of the finest titles in living memory and Deus Ex will live on for decades to come.			"

												Well, I've read somewhere one can beat this game killing only two people. TBH I don't have guts to prove this true, because I'm having great time assasinating everyone. This is definitely a good game with just minor AI problems and LOAD OF easter eggs. Gives a laugh and a thrill.9/10 seal of quality.			"

												As a card carrying Illuminati member I can vouch for the accuracy of this game. By 2052 the world will be like this, augmentation, survelliance, we're working on it. We know all about that stuff you watch you disgusting deviant. In the game you can be a stealthy secret agent man or a guns blazing killer. It has all the freedom of the real world without the consequences or problems. If you hate your reality you'll love escaping into this one, it has robots, guns and crossbows that make people run around grunting for a few seconds before they fall asleep. And remember, LAMS can't destroy steel beams.			"

												Deus Ex plays quite well after 17 years. The majority of games cannot lay claim to this feat. I would like to see JC Denton era of Deus Ex come to life. However, Square Enix would have to hone very close to the bone in order for it to be genuine. Such a game would have to capture the original Deus Ex ambience precisely while bringing something new. Not a lot new but something. Neat trick if they could pull it off. So, here is to the hope that they neatly wrap up Adam Jensen's era and start up JC Denton and Paul in a prequel game. Or even a game wherein JC regects the final scenarios of Deus Ex and bring about his own version. In any event, Deus Ex is one of the few games which deserves to be called ""classic."" Yes, that is almost cliche but for Deus Ex it is true. It is a ""classic"" video game. Never duplicated. So, it can be called unigue.			"

												If you like single player Half-Life (or the sequels), then you'll like this. I played it in 2010, so the graphics are old school, but it worked just fine on my Vista PC. Unlike Half-Life, the protagnist talks, and a lot of effort has gone into making the experience immersive and consistent. Throughout the game you can choose violent or non-violent solutions to problems, but at its heart this is a FPS for the thinking gamer. 96/100.			"

There are plenty of walk throughs online if you want a little help with codes and finding side quests. Buy it and enjoy it.			"

												I find myself amidst this Deus Ex conundrum.I have no nostalgia for this game, I didn't play it when it was new or recent, not even once - I had only heard about it and its legendary status. I finally got to play it in 2013 and despite the decade of immense hype I loved it. I must have played through the whole game about 3 or 4 times in a row in different playstyles and difficulties. Had I not picked it up again today I would have given it a glowing recommendation, praising its atmosphere, incredible length and size but inbetween 2013 and now I have also played about 100 hours of Deus Ex Human Revolution and despite its flaws I find it to be a much better game in almost every aspect. Deus Ex was a landmark title in gaming but replaying it now it feels so terribly clunky.On a technical level it's laughable even for its time which personally I don't mind as much because I grew up in the nineties but new players will definitely have a hard time getting accustomed to the graphics which do a big disservice to the UT engine. The voice acting is also comical, which I don't mind as much either, it's just something I need to mention in an honest recommendation.The game is sizeable but it definitely runs out of steam in the middle and while the story is pretty good it isn't anything you haven't heard before if you've played a game or read a book in the cyberpunk genre. Expect X-Files type conspiracy theories, AIs, a mysterious disease and allies of questionable allegiance. There are however some great dialogue scenes that really stuck with me. It's not high literature but it's admittedly a lot smarter and adult than most cyberpunk games.I also think that the wealth of choices you have in the story has been grossly exaggerated. It's mostly details like being called out on going into the lady's bathroom or a few lines of dialogue changing because you killed an ally because he would become a boss fight later on. There's no branching storyline to speak of but in the end you can choose different endings, albeit not as clumsily as in Human Revolution where you literally got 4 buttons to choose an ending from. My main gripe are the gameplay mechanics. Even when you know what you are doing and which augmentations and skills to upgrade, both gunplay and stealth mechanics feel quite clunky and unbalanced, and I found them highly frustrating on my most recent attempt at a playthrough. Those accustomed to newer entries in the series or other stealth games will probably demand more fluency and variety. You can always choose a slightly different route in the levels which takes the edge of these flaws a little bit but they remain much too noticeable to ignore.There's also the myriad of technical issues and bugs I've encountered with the steam port so far, which I don't recall from the retail version, which admittedly had its own unique bugs I could exploit. I liked how I never had to upgrade lockpicking because opening the inventory while using a lockpick would only drain one item no matter which level the lock had. Deus Ex is still an important milestone in gaming that everyone should have played through at least once, but I think it's starting to show its age quite badly. I was really looking forward to a replay but the first hour felt much too tedious I think I'm going to pass. It's not a bad game, if you have a lot of patience you might love it the way I first did but it has always been flawed. I treasure my memories of first playing it though.			"

												Stream Version might not work on your rig. this is why...Had to refund because it could not play on my pc. I could not walk, my character ran at like 1000%+ normal speed, the converstations lasted all of a few mili seconds, and could not even get pass the starting area. Looked up ways to fix it, but was unplayable. I7-2600k, 16 gig ram, gt 960 rig, could not get any help from support on this there for got a full refund for it. Playing it on console ie a ps2, would be a lot more stable, just have to go dust them off first. There was no frame issues, edited the settings in game and in the installer, just wasn't able to get it to slow down.As for the game over all:I owned this game when it came out in the 2000's .I beat all 3 endings. The story was one of the bests from all the games I played while in high school, I got it as a gift from an school friend of mine. It was engaging, it was hard,  I got stuck a lot, but it was worth it. The newer games in this series to me don't have the same feel as this BUT, I think it was due, like many others, your first game experence is normally the best. This and a few other games made me go 'wow' and 'wtf' at the end of it, and made me rethink things in life as a kid, to open up my mind for things etc.OVERALL for buying it on steam:There is a chance you might but this and it could possibly not work, which makes you have to get a refund on it, I tried for 30 mins to play the game, it was unplay able and at the start of this I put down what my set up is, one would assume, yea, system if powerful enough to have it work, but, I have no idea why the seed is so fast. I press forward and I move so fast I can cross a room in a blink rather then taking 1 step. To me that means it is not worth playing. Buy it but make sure to test it asap and if it works for you GREAT ... if not, stop playing it, research a fix but don't keep the game launched so you don't go over the 'refund time' limit.			"

												I would have liked to give this game a nice review. Sure, it's a bit dated and all, but it still has a nice atmosphere. But alas, in 2017, this thing is basically unplayable. Seemingly this is a newer thing, but right now it is completely broken. If you die and start over, your inventory breaks. Randomly the picture just disappears and all you are left with is the HUD and the sound of someone shooting at you. Only solution when it happens? Quit the game and start it up again. If this happened once in a while, it would be bearable, but it's all the friggin' time. I'm giving up. Maybe someone will patch it in the future?			"

												Sacrilegious as it may be to say but I don't like Deus Ex (Original). While I have already the ire of many devoted fans, let me preface this review with some info:-I love the idea of DX games, and I like Human Revolution and Mankind Divided. I appreciate the importance of DX but that doesn't mean it's perfect. -A game from the early 2000s is going to ask more from the player. Some of these aspects I like, such as the lack of handholding, while others I detest because they are aggravating or pointless.-The only mod I used is a launcher to use modern resolutions and FOV.-I have finished this game once after three restarts to better understand the gameplay. What convinced me to give this a negative review is that the game's quality worsens after you arrive in Hong Kong. Talking about its impact became more interesting than playing it.-My specific issue is how the game becomes more viable to use exploits like your sword than your tools. The lethal playstyles have never won me over with subpar FPS mechanics.And before anyone suggests I should have installed an overhaul, I like to play old games as true-to-form as possible. The only exception I'll accept is adding free-aiming to DOOM. I enjoy understanding each game's strengths and weaknesses, and when it comes to DX I find the weaknesses can only be accepted if the game scratches your niche.You're Going To Need a BackscratcherIf you like to go into games blind to enjoy learning as you go, I would suggest you avoid that habit. If you want to ignore my advice, then play the first few missions over until you find what works best; however, don't plan playing non-lethally for your first run.DX expects you to know what skills you should invest into and where you can find augment-canisters to get your abilities quick. What makes it particularly more annoying than other games is how the mechanics are constrained by your skills. Aim-reticules take far longer to line up if you move or are not trained in a specific weapon, which some of them are not as obvious without reading their details (ex. handling pistols improves crossbows.) As for the other skills, all they do is improve the efficiency of a certain skill either by decreasing the time spent or by improving how many tools you need to use for an obstacle. There is a common joke how you should never invest into Swimming; the same could be said for many other skills: Hacking and Health beyond untrained, and you forgoing Explosives and Environmental Training. This is because certain augments provide the same bonuses without items to take up your limited inventory space. Unfortunately, augmentations have an annoying issue: You have to play ""red-light-green-light"" with them, which is far too cumbersome to manage for what are passive buffs like combat strength. (They should still use energy but only when in context.)The worst problem is how it hampers non-lethal playstyles by the game's inconsistency. As much as I enjoy the versatile items from pepper-sprays to stun-rods to tranq-darts, it's obviously not as balanced in the late-game. For example, tranq-darts are not an automatic knock-out to the head; it's based on what skill-level you are for pistols, and for some enemies they are immune to your whole arsenal. Your only option is to avoid them. This wouldn't be a problem if the stealth system wasn't as simple as it is in this game, so you will be save-scumming far too often as compared to pulling out your sword (regardless of your skill) for a one-or-two-kill.  Trying to go guns-blazing also has its own problems. As mentioned beforehand, the augments have to enabled/disabled manually, which is defaulted to all F-number keys. Even if you rebound the keys the fighting would be too cumbersome to move, turn augments on-and-off, and aim properly, and the AI doesn't account for that amount of time. And choosing to use the pause menu to enable/disable breaks the pace. There is simply too much going on for action to make it a viable means with guns--but running around a sword is a sure-win tactic. I emphasize that sword's importance because it's one of the many game-breaking aspects fans come to love about the game. I don't enjoy breaking a game's balance so it irritates me more than others. The point of this is that by the time I got to the end all I needed was a sniper with a silencer, a sword, a shotgun for robotic spiders, and grenades and other consumables. (Some are too specific like fire extinguishers.) The extraneous tools quickly became forgotten because they were less efficient, and seeing how many tools I passed over made me aware of how often the amount of diverging paths are also illusions of choice.""When Stanley Came to a Set of Two Open Doors...""There is a section that best illustrates however mechanically diverse the game handles situations it's often an illusion of choice. During the third mission from UNACTO of finding Ambrosia, you sneak into the tunnels and stop at an impasse. To the right you can use a lock-pick to access the valve, and to the left you can use a multitools to turn off the lasers. (Or you can make a stair-case of mines to hop over the lasers.) Every option will lead to the same room.That moment epitomizes various things. For one, the only differences between using a multitool and a lock pick is how many of each item do you have and what skill-level are you. Second, whenever the game offers you a choice—to spare or to kill, to choose one side or action over another, etc.—it will always bottleneck to the plot. Third, once you see past the facade it's evident how the game is a linear set of missions with variables to play with. For the time, DX is impressive and should be noted for its innovation. My issue isn't that the game lies to you about the impact of your choices; it's how the mechanics are superficial paths with no challenge. Perhaps it's because I enjoyed the hacking mini-game of MD so much that the loading bar for hacking in DX made me longing for mechanical complexity with my tools.I don't even mind the endings because they have never mattered in DX games; what matters are the effects of the accumulation of your moment-to-moment choices. This quality is still in the original, but the effect I find lacks the impact of other games where there was more variety in how going about an objective changed the game. Let Me Repeat Myself: It's Not a Bad Game; It's Flawed Of all the things that disappointed me the most is the storytelling. This isn't to say the writing quality is bad; in fact, it's good in spite of the more glaring issue, the voice-actors. I normally enjoy hammy actors but the dialogue is so monotone that I couldn't even enjoy the sillier elements like the Illuminati factoids. (Jensen is no Shakespearean actor but he's more lively than Stonewall Denton.) I felt more attached to reading the emails to give more background on characters than listening to them.I don't hear many people bring up that issue of immersion for such a serious game of prophetic visions of the future. Maybe I could have felt more attached to the storyline had I been exposed to this game at a younger age when 9/11 was more relevant, but I will say the themes underlying the story are still terrifyingly relatable. That quality is timeless.  All of these criticisms are not to disillusion fans but to illustrate the flaws that are in this ""perfect"" game. As for those who say I don't get it, I don't think it's healthy to ignore issues with a beloved classic and then lambaste the modern takes for having unobtainable goals. All DX games have their flaws, some have a greater fall than others, but we can all cherish the core of DX.If that doesn't extinguish any flame-wars, just remember one thing: ""What good's an honest soldier if he can be ordered to behave like a terrorist?""

The game starts and two guys are standing around talking about a plague and riots and♥♥♥♥♥♥ Its like im watching CNN not playing a game. Anyway after the long boring intro you play the game and ohh boy does this game get much worse. Your brother comes and talks to you about how you shoulnt kill people and how you are police. YAWN! Anyway you run around with your pistol and YOU CANT HIT ANYTHING and die really quickly even on easy. You are supposed to be this cybernetic bad♥♥♥♥♥but you have the worse aim in video game history and go down like pinata. When you finally find the terotist leader, I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not. HE STARTS TALKING ABOUT TAXES!. It was a this point I turned the game off. If i wanted to hear about taxes i would have become an accountant.			"

												It makes me sad that I cannot in good faith recommend purchasing this game, because it is one of those incredibly important games in videogame history. Much like Wolfenstein/Doom, Thief, Half-Life, etc., the original Deus Ex figuratively ""broke ground"" in gaming by using elements from all of the aforementioned titles to create a game where stealth, ranged combat, NPC interactions, multiple paths to an objective, and a pretty impressive amount of lore and story elements, combining all of these to make a jaw-dropping (for the time) experience. It's still amazing to look back on this game and forever respect it for the road it has paved to inspire other games such as Deus Ex Human Revolution and its sequel, Mankind Divided, as well as Vampire - The Masquerade: Bloodlines and Dishonored and Dishonored 2.Why then, do I not recommend that you buy this game? Well, because this is one hideous game to look at, and feels painfully ""clunky"" with a lot that simply has not aged well. The sky in the outdoors areas feels faker than the original and much older Doom's skies (I am not me exaggerating), and much of the map feels painfully open with very long distances with nothing to interact with. You can run several hundred feet (100 yards or so) with virtually nothing to do on the first map of the game, in various parts of the level. You won't be picking up items, talking to people, killing or KO-ing anything, learning story, or even experiencing atmosphere. The game's first map is shamefully guilty of this, though it improves as the game goes on. Picking up and throwing objects has the most awkward and ""heavy"" physics I've seen in a game, and this title encourages save-scumming (quick saving and quick loading all the time) more than most games, because attacks that should be one-hit kills, like a trained skill level headshot from three feet away in stealth with a pistol, may take 2-3 shots to a head that's bare or wearing a ski mask, resulting in enemies hearing him scream, ruining your stealth. Same goes for lockpicking and multitools (hacking things that aren't computer consoles). ""I only have a handful of lockpicks. Is opening this case worth it?"" *lockpicks it and it contains terrible items* ""Wasn't worth it!"" Time to quick load. The newer games just handle this better, having risky hacking where you can be seen by humans or cameras, and can get cheeky/inventive by putting vending machines in the way comically so you won't be spotted. Speaking of which, my own complaints aside, many of which are undoubtedly personal preference, the fact of the matter is that the newer Deus Ex games are simply better in virtually every way. I'm in my 30s at present and was playing Space Quest III when it was brand spankin' new, so this isn't a situation of being too young to appreciate the original Deus Ex, and I played the original DX in the early 2000s, so I'm not just now coming into this game with Human Revolution and such already existing before I tried it. The problem is that while yes, this game broke incredible ground and deserves the respect it has, it unfortunately has been outdone by its sequels and most of the other games of its genre. You can get more Deus Ex from the (currently) two more recent titles in the franchise, and all the features have been carried over and improved in so many ways since then. While a game like VtM Bloodlines is very outdated compared to Mankind Divided, at least it can be argued that no other games exist in that universe that are in the Deus Ex ""genre,"" so there are reasons other than nostalgia for someone to play it. Since Deus Ex has been outdone by its sequels, there is no reason to go back, other than nostalgia, and chances are, people with DX nostalgia already own it, so there is no cause for recommending the game to them. In closing...it was a game that did fantastic things I will always respect it for, but it's clunky and outdated with a lead character who does not seem to care with comically bad line delivery and the better parts of its plot are in newspapers and books you just read in-game, reiterating that instead of playing this game, you could play a newer one and/or read about this game's story/lore online.

												Im one of those people who haven't played deus ex when it first released, i started playing games way after 2000. Even though i love some of the older games this one just feels too old to be full immersed. It is now 2017 and this game falls out by modern standards and anyone who says otherwise is driven with nostalgia. What i mean is i don't say that deus ex is bad or good, i simply dont recommend to buy it if you never played it before.			"

												I don't see what's so great about Deus Ex.To get the game to run on modern PCs various mods are needed. Alt Tabing out of the game or using the steam overlay causes a spectacular crash either way. Without the relavant mods the game has absolutely attrocious framerate issues.As a shooter the game is esoteric; aiming has nothing to do with actually trying to hit the target, it's determined by how long the player is willing to stand still doing nothing until the crosshairs decide to reach their smallest size allowing a projectile to land anywhere near the intended target; this, alongside the game's awkward default controls leads me to think that this game wasn't meant to be played using a mouse at all.As a stealth game Deus Ex is laughably bad, enemies can't see the player even if he was standing directly in front of them as long as he was a sufficent distance from them. Don't bother with the tranquilizer darts as enemies will spas out shooting at the player and running to the nearest alarm; which would be the exact oposite of tranquil. The only purpose it serves is being able to knock out Men In Black to take their ammunition as a opposed to them exploding for no reason after death.As an RPG the game holds very little options at all. What I do admire is that the game doesn't award skill points for killing enemies, which encourages going for the quiet approach. Skill points can be spent on the game's various skills, which include such wonderous options like Swimming. Honestly there's very little reason to spend points on any skill past rank 2 aside to fix the god-awful accuracy of all the guns in the game by leveling a weapon skill, since leveling lockpicking or engineering will see the player rarely ever run out of lockpicks or multitools. Yes, that's run out of, as in, it doesn't actually improve the player's ability; in the words of Spaceballs: ""Even in the future nothing works!"" since absolutely everything you use, lockpicks, multitools, armor, invisibility, will break and vanish after using it once and their relavant skills determine how long you can actually use it after activating it or determine the percentage a lockpick or multitool will knock off the lock.The game has a focus on Augmentation, to get them the player must gather augmentation canisters and upgrades. Each canister has two options for the player to implant, and the choice is permanent. Really the only useful ones are Regeneration(medkits and the medicine skill became close to useless after that), Speed(the levels are way too large and way too empty to take things slowly), and Power Regulation, as everything else is too wildly situational and expensive in bioenergy to be useful, even when I did use other augmentations they seems to have absolutely no effect. Despite claiming that his vision was augmented the default light augmentation only makes the player glow like a Christmas tree instead of granting nightvision, which is soon made rather pointless anyways.Comically, the game is hilariously easy for a simple reason, the weapons used by both the player and the enemy switch between useless and over-powered. About a quarter into the game the player is granted the Dragon Tooth, basically a lightsaber that kills absolutely everything that is human in one hit(even 'boss' enemies die to two or three hits with this thing, usually to only one if it hits the head); say goodbye to useless pistols and rifles that JC can't aim to save his life; yes, just sit there until your cataracts stop acting up JC, eventually you have to hit him! Really, there is absolutely no reason to use anything else except for it and the GEP gun. Speaking of the GEP gun, at the very start of the game the player is granted the options of getting a crossbow, a sniper rifle, or a GEP gun. Only mere meters away from the person who gives it to you is a free crossbow anyways. The GEP gun can kill anything is that is -or is not- human in one shot, it even comes with a lock-on feature to any target in the game! So there's the Dream Team: The Dragon Tooth and the GEP gun! Both available right at the start of the game! Incidentally the enemy also has access to such weapons, whom are virtually harmless as it takes them entire seconds to register that the player is a threat, that is if they actually see the player as their field of vision is about 5 meters far. Believe me I wanted to use the Plasma Rifle instead, but that thing is a peice of trash that deals no damage, takes too long to load, has an effective range about as big as its splash radious, the ammo is practically non-existent, and anything worth shooting at with it has an energy shield. All the other guns in this game suck for one reason or another actually, usually for their terrible damage and accuracy.The game features a little economy which is close to pointless as there are very few shops that sell things the player actually needs, so if the player has been hacking ATMs since the start it would be best to buy absolutely everything they find that isn't food as they will have few chances to buy anything else unless they're fans of hoarding Soylent Green chocolate bars.The story starts out rather predicably, the player plays as JC Dention, who they can actually give a 'real' name to which in true RPG fashion is mentioned only in text files on very few of the game's PCs. They work for the big bad gov'ment and have to stop the terrorists from stealing the useless vaccine for the plague, and I'm sure you already see where this is going. Mere hours(apparently a day, but I can't tell since there's no sun in this game) after joining the force JC betrays the gov'ment and fights for the terrorists and it turns out that the plague is man-made and the terrorists can make a cure! So with the help of some Artificial Intelligences and a bunch of useless jerks JC singlehandedly kills all the bad guys, launches some nukes, and destroys some bases before he reaches the final base that needs to explode and the game suddenly decides that it wouldn't be an RPG if there weren't final choices! Which feels rather token considering that game had no meaningful choices before that point, and it certainly didn't start there, since the only thing this choice does is grant a minute long cutscene and a quote from some moron from the 17th century before cuting to the credits.

												Please note: this first-impression review is heavily biased by two factors:- I suck at action games.- I play in my living room (with a Steam Link and Steam Controller).If neither of these apply to you, you should probably ignore this review.I had great hopes for this game, based on the many positivew reviews I read. Unfortunately, things did not work out well for me, I was hit right off the bat by two things:1) At the start of the game, I had no idea what to do. The controls are complicated and not obvious, and the Steam version of the game does not come with a manual. After repeatedly looking at the Settings>Controls menu, and lots of experimentation, I finally was able to figure out enough to complete the rather simplistic tutorial (after several attempts). 2) The entire UI is designed with a fixed size in pixels. The result is that, in a living room context, most of the text is not readable at any resolution higher than about 1024x720. Other annoyances:- Switching to another window often does really bad things, resulting in a need to hard-abort and restart. When using a Steam Link, this is a game-killer.- It always runs full screen, so things are distored at any aspect ratio (e.g. 4:3 used for lower resolutions) that does not match the monitor (e.g. 16:9).- This is an OLD game. The graphics were probably impressive at the time, but they are now quite dated.I may try again after I've finished my backlog of great games that don't have these problems (e.g. Deus Ex: Human Revolution).

												Unplayable, Game runs at 900 FPS for me, and physics are completely broken. I could bearly make the jump in the training area because of how fast the game was running. But when you get to the water part, the game drops to 200 fps, and it is a lot more playable for 5 seconds, until you pass that small segment. Text boxes are cut off before the audio can finish playing because of the games timing being off. I looked in the option menu to try to find a setting to limit fps, but I couldn't find it anywhere.

												Even though I respect the original Deus Ex for what it did for the video game industry, it has not aged very well. The game play is feels dated, the acting is just awful, and it's really boring for a stealth game. Which is a shame because I love stealth games. I will give the game this though. the stroy is pretty good so if you just want to play it for the story than buy this game. If you want great gameplay than get Human Revolution, or Mankind Devided.

												I picked this up ages ago. Played it for 5mins, got distracted (for a long long time). Finally came back to it and now I am remembering why I only played it for 5mins (might have been more like 15mins but it was a really busy summer with not much game time available so who knows?). Jumping.In the training scenario, the Jumping mechanism is what absolutely KILLS the game. I recognize this is a flaw in my personality that I can't move past this, since the game does not actually start at the training area and I am sure there are plenty of missions/areas/scenarios/encounters/events/etc where Jumping is NOT involved at all. But to me, this kind of roadblock makes the game entirely unplayable. So, if you're like me, avoid this ""classic"" and go back to 4x and roguelikes where at least the sadism is right out in the open.			"

You can get the same but better looking and easier to run from the newer Deus Ex.the fanboys of this game are utter trash who try to downvote any opinion thats even slightly negative, no matter how right that point is. It ruins the integrity of the game when proper and honest reviews cant even be posted. This is a classic game over a decade old that has sold millions of copies. Quit acting like children and crying when people criticize its age. A few negative reviews that are truthful are not gonna hurt the sales you overly nostalgic pieces of fecal matter.			"

												Deus Ex is a game that one only reads positive things about. I had high expectations ... and I got disappointed big time.The game starts out alright. But after a while, it becomes more and more repetitive. Re-visiting the same old locations over and over again is not my idea of good level design.I also ran into trouble with the game mechanics in Hongkong. Yes, the game lets you solve goals in different ways. But I attacked that level in a way that the programmers obviously did not anticipate. Essentially, it did what had to be done, but some goals remained uncompleted. I am about mid-game and I simply do not want to find out what happens at the end of the game, when these uncompleted goals might prevent me from finishing it. Unfortunately, my last save game before this mishap is roughly 10 hours in the past.All in all, the game has become so utterly boring, that I stopped caring about seing the end.Game over.			"

												Only played about 50 minutes of the game. The tutorial was pretty great compared to other games that just throw you in blindly. The graphics are outdated, but that doesn't effect the game at all really, except for those people that complain about everything. The way the skills are intergrated into the game is pretty neat, and probably a game changer at the time of the release, along with all the multiple choices. But it's just not that fun in 2015. It's an outdated game that everyone still thinks is great, for those who had played it back 15 years ago they most probably still love it, and would reccomend it to everyone. I can't reccomend Deus Ex as I find it more of a task to play than fun to play.If I had played this game 10 or so years ago, I probably woulda loved it, but the game is overhyped in this day and age, and it really isn't what a lot of people would expect.

												I'm going to get flak for this but, this game is a buggy mess and not what people have preached it to be, curb thy enthusiasm.1.	The idea you can beat the game by not killing anyone is only true because you bug the  !@#& out the game, you’re supposed to kill people at certain points, but by doing all manners of bugs you can use glitches to avoid it. Also getting ""Clean"" runs is intself rather game breaking. 2.	This game suffers from being way to long; most people would recall the first level, but if pressed would have no memory of some interim levels. If no one has sat you down and told you why warehouse levels used to be hated, let this game warm you up to the idea. 3.	 The game suffers from guess what the programmers was thinking from time to time.  The game lets you use almost any skill set, but you need to kind of understand what the game programmer’s logic was. I could never understand pistols in this game until I heard a post mortem of the game online and learned that they were supposed to be an “intelligent” choice where you used things like barrels and other game mechanics to supplement there strength. I cannot recommend this game in good faith having played through to the end, to say the bugs should be fixed would result in old fans not being able to get there ""clean"" runs. The length makes the better moments really far and few between. Overall get the newer games if your looking to play a deus ex game.			"

												This is ... not a good game.It would have been okay when it originally released in 2000, but the interesting story and characters are severely hampered by bad gameplay. The controls feel like steering a shopping cart, the UI is bad, and the foes are all bullet sponges (even the unarmored and unaugmented humans) in a world that hordes ammo like it was the zombie apocalypse.I really like everything about this game EXCEPT PLAYING IT. Interesting characters, complex conspiracies (poorly executed, but if they were doing it well you'd probably miss it), a dystopian future that is distressingly more plausible every day, choices and consequences, multiple options for resolving tactical challenges, lots of exploration and rewards for doing so, a strong emphasis on story, and the ability to alter the fate of the game world. Unfortunately, playing it is a tedious chore that is sometimes actually painful, and never fun.Great ideas, and the writing is good, but the only reason this gets praise still is nostalgia. People played it as children, loved it when they had nothing better to compare it to, and still remember it fondly. Stay away.If you want to play in this universe, Human Revolution is nearly as solid a story and has significantly better gameplay.Edit:Clarification about why I say the gameplay is bad.I sat down to play DX, and discovered that I could barely interact with the world, that the control scheme was just bad.So, I did my research. I learned that it used the same engine and similar features as System Shock 2 (another beloved classic). So, I tracked down SS2 and started playing.SS2 is violent, twitchy, and unforgiving. It also has an interesting discovery-based narrative (the story happened before you show up) that I found compelling. I put in the work, adjusted the controls, tweaked my upgrades to match my prefered play style, and beat SS2. I even had a lot of fun doing it.With all my training, I came back to DX. I adjusted the button layout to match my trained reflexes, put on my patience hat, and settled in to enjoy DX.Deus Ex still controlled terribly.System Shock 2 is older, less ambitious, and less well regarded than Deus Ex. SS2 also has smoother, more responsive gameplay, a more useful UI, and does a much better job of making the protagonist feel like an augmeted badass (regardless of playstyle).That's why I say DX has terrible controls. Because an older game, using the same engine, did it better.			"

												I’ll start off with saying I have no nostalgia for this game. I have never played any Deus Ex game before writing this review. I do, however, understand that this game was very well regarded back when it came out. And I can definitely see that. It introduced many ways to complete an objective and gave the player a sense of freedom. It also has an interesting augmentation upgrade system. So…I see where all the positive reviews are coming from. However, I couldn’t get into this game and had to stop playing after 4 hours.Deus Ex is clearly going for more of a stealth based game rather than combat. But the stealth mechanics (or lack thereof) make it extremely difficult to do so. The wide open maps don’t cater to a stealth approach. You are given stealth-like weapons but they all felt very underpowered and useless, so I wasn’t inclined to use them. I found it was easier to run up to enemies with the crowbar and whack them until they died. The default mapping of buttons is a bizarre choice by the developers. You can change most aspects of the controls in the options, however.Uninteresting story that I never got into. The bad voice acting didn’t help either. Although I think robotic sounding voices are intentional for the nano-augmented characters and mech characters. The enemy AI is also very bad. Sometimes they’ll run around and never shoot or they’ll stand there and fight. The damage the enemy inflicts on you is pretty big, even on medium difficulty. I also couldn’t figure out how I died a lot of times. There is a health meter per body part, but I couldn’t figure out what was important or how it related to when I died. On a positive note, there is a lot of story here. Many books, newspaper clippings and emails to read. As well as many NPC’s to talk to. There are side missions too. It’s a lot of content, which is great, but only if the gameplay makes me want to continue, which in this case it did not. Autosave doesn't exist so you have to quick save or save manually. You'll be quick saving and quick loading a lot.To get 60fps, use a different launcherDeus Ex runs at a very low framerate. Do a google search for “kentie launcher”. Install that and you’ll be able to get 60fps as well as have some more graphical options. Pros+Lots of extra story and Deus Ex world lore to uncover+Multiple ways to complete a level+Nice augmentation system for its time.+Inventory system is okCons+Story is uninteresting+Voice acting is subpar+Stealth mechanics lacking+Combat system is clunky+AI is lackingDeus Ex is a stealth based game with FPS elements but provides the mechanics and tools for neither. A game that was undoubtedly great in its time, but falls flat today.4/10 Below average			"

												Let me start off with this: I really, REALLY wanted to like this game. But I just can't get into it. Human Revolution (One of my top three favorite games of all time) sucked me in as soon as I saw the first cutscene and was hooked once I finished the tutorial. I have bought the it twice for the 360 (one regular copy. one director's cut copy), and I will most likely get another copy for PC. I am also super excited for Mankind Divided and will definitely buy it, once there are enough reviews to confirm that it’s good.. But this game. I just can't get into it. The tutorial was torture, the controls are funky, the voice acting seems bland (Human Revolution even had some bland voice acting at points but it did not turn me off from the game at all),  and the first mission just felt like a chore. The community that loves this game promised me things like “Trust me you will love this game”, “Best game that money can buy”, and “As soon as you finish the first mission you will fall in love with this game”. And the hype that the community has build up just shattered to pieces as I played it. I am not just hating on this game because I can't appreciate a good story, or don't appreciate the older classic games. I am hating on this game because the community that plays it have built up so much hype and everyone had me ready to play one of the greatest games of all time and I'm left just disappointed. The first thought I had after a 40 minute session with this game was ""Whoa, that was disappointing"". I don't hate this game and contrary to my review, I don't not recommend this game. I just don't know exactly who to recommend it to. Maybe I’m just spoiled by the graphics, controls, or features of modern games. Maybe I’m playing it wrong. Or maybe I’m not old enough to feel nostalgia for this game or how revolutionary it was at the time. I do know one thing about this game though. It did not nearly live up to my expectations that the community had built up for it. And before you yell at me for not even playing an hour of this game, It’s because I will be asking steam for a refund, because it’s unlikely that what I have seen from it so far will get any better by my standards. I’m sorry that I’m not able to appreciate what a masterpiece this was for its time, but I just can’t bring myself to like it. No matter how much I wanted to before I bought it and played it.			"

I don't mid the graphics because what i search for is deep and interesting gameplay NOT only history, the ""player bob"" mechanic is without a doubt the worst i have experienced in my life in any shotter game. Also the levels are too open for a ""stealth"" game and the character itself moves so much like a tank that even the best controls in the world wouldn't be able to fix him.Play System Shock 2 instead, it's older and somehow actually scary and atmospheric with the right texture mods,			"

												Okay, I've logged a few hours into the game so I suppose I'd better update my review:Firstly I had to rebind my keys into something that could be played with two hands..not a great start. First mission, movement was clunky and shooting bad guys became repetitive almost immediately. I like the inventory feature, picking up weapons, shouldering them...that's nice. I feel like the story so far is intriguing, if it weren't for the way the game plays I would definitely be interested into seeing how the plot adapts. I'll probably read up about it online, I can't bring myself to play through a game I'm not enjoying. I'm guessing on the majority of the people disliking this review will be hardcore fans of the game... those that played it as a child and remember it fondly. For my first time playing this I haven't seen what makes the game so special I'm afraid to say and will have to give it a thumbs down.This isn't a bad game, but not something I'm going to go back and play any time soon.

												This game is overated and honestly doesnt hold up. I recently played through Deus Ex human revultion on my PS3 and really enjoyed it. However I just find this game clunky and bad, such as the issues with controls and the fact that there is no third person. I love old stealth games such as Metal Gear Solid and Metal Gear. However one of the main reasons I enjoy them is because there in third person and I can always see around me, and although metal gear solids controls are not good compared to Deus Ex's controlls they are flawless.For me this was just dissapointing, but there is so much critical acliaim for this so try it if you really enjoy stelath or if its on sale however, the over complicated controls and lack of a thirdperson mode ruined this for me. Oh yeah let me guess all the people that said this wasn't helpfull are huge fanboys and cant take anyone saying anything negative about there game!			"

The cheese levels have only grown higher with time. Honestly the late 90’s cheese is really the only thing that I can still recommend about Deus Ex besides the nostalgia factor.

												Awful framerate, poorly aged visuals(even with mods) and off-balanced stealth vs combat mechanics.The stealth itself barely works because your stealth weapons are♥♥♥♥♥♥and it really doesn't help thta the AI is so god awful, too.My first experience with Deus Ex was Invisible War back on the first Xbox and I honestly loved it.Hell, THAT game plays better than this even considering the fact that it's almost like Deus Ex ""Lite"" in comparison.The raging nostalgia fan boys are right.This game DOES need a remake.Bad.The nostalgia biotches will likely rate this down but don't waste your time and certainly not your money just for a trip down memory lane or even to see what all the hype was about ""back in the day"".Just like System Shock 2, it's another game that aged more like cheese instead of wine.The♥♥♥♥♥♥stains in my underwear look better than this game and even though I grew up playing games as early as the NES and am not bothered that much by graphics doesn't excuse the fact that it plays and runs so horribly on a system that plays Alien Isolation and Crysis 2(on MAX SETTINGS) with little to no effort.The best thing about this game is the story, depth and soundtrack and 2 out of 3 of those can be experienced on YouTube and be much more enjoyable than playing this old but not so gold ""classic"".Game of the year, indeed.....when the year was 2000.

												Deus Ex is a relic of an older time--and it should have stayed there.No aspect of Deus Ex has aged in any graceful capacity. Its convoluted gameplay mechanics, overwritten story, and trenchcoat visuals were hoary and tired when it was first released, and it doesn't look any better today.Its allegedly open-ended gameplay only offers alternatives if you're prescient enough to bring materials and develop in-game skills on the chance of one, out-of-the-way grate being placed in the most obtuse location possible. Character development is a joke when only one third of any of your skills and upgrades have any use, and stealth is not an option when you can't even tell if you're properly hidden from line of sight, let alone when you need half a game's worth of EXP to develop anything resembling decent stealth stats. (Metal Gear Solid came out two years before Deus Ex; maybe they should have cribbed MGS's stealth instead of The Matrix's obsession with leather clothing.)This game also has some of the most infantile writing ever, hoping you'll be impressed by having celebrated tinfoil hat-supporters like The Illuminati namedropped. If you ever thought Dan Brown didn't try hard enough for REALISM, have I got the game for you!The greatest slap to the face is that Deus Ex is terribly optimized for modern PCs; you have to download a third-party patch to make sure this game looks decently lit. I stumbled around with my Eyeshine upgrade active at all times for over an hour before learning ""Hey, this game isn't meant to be THAT ugly!""Save your money. At the time of this writing, there's exactly one good ""Deus Ex"" game; it carries the subtitle ""Human Revolution"". This game is an appendix of a bygone era.			"

I can love games that are old, I adore oblivion but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game. Everybody praises it as being literally god itself but fails to realise the terrible controls, horrific graphics, AI that have less sense than a plank of wood and aiming having the ♥♥♥♥♥iest system in the word. It's lethal and non-lethal systems are crap considering that the contrast between them just leaves after a few levels. There is choice but it's smaller than you would believe and it still doesn't matter due to the terrible story.Honestly I don't enjoy each time I play it because it doesn't feel satisfying to play at all.

												I may get some flack for this one. I'm not averse to older games by any stretch of the imagination - my two favorites of all time are Riven and Thief 2. So returning to this it was NOT the graphics that threw me - it was the controls and movement mechanics, voice acting, and total lack of interest in the story. Steam only records a half hours - but it was my latest return to a game I had a physical disc for and have tried several times over the years.I'm not denying that the game was hugely influential, and loved by millions. I am not denying that at one point in time this game offered more choice and a singular setting and story for people. However it's 2015 and there are literally dozens of other games that anyone wanting this sort of thing could be spending their time on. So realistically - I would not recommend it.Some caveats/exceptions. If you loved the game as a child or when you were younger and wonder if it runs alright on modern OS's it seems to. The keys are mostly re-bindable, I simply don't enjoy the movement and mechancis itself. I should also say if you tend to PREFER older games to newer ones, go ahead and pick this one up. If you being hounded by several friends to just ""suck it up"" and try this one, I can attest that the fourth attempt and nearly 15-20 overall hours of ""sucking it up"" have only made me incredibly bored of this game.

												Deus Ex is a game that people will defend forever because of nostalgia, I used to be one of them, but since playing it last year this was the first time where nostalgia just wasnt pushing me through the game to the point of me wanting to finish it.Newer players will most likely not find things fun (SOME CAN FIND IT FUN BUT NOT ALL) Some reasons for this can be:Graphics, this sounds dumb but modern gamers sometimes cant look past graphics, this has been some peoples issue with The Witcher 1, not everyone will care but ive known this to be an issue with many, its why we have remakes, so get on it square enix remake this now.Gameplay, the game can seem clunky at times and has skillpoints that no person would want nor ever need but newers players wouldnt know this, some say this is just a learning experience but others could find this just plain annoying, stealth is AMAZING-ly easy as the AI would make better bricks than guards.The combat is mixed while very challenging which is great, it can seem kinda flawed with weapons such as the flamethrower and crossbow being so good you no need to grab anything else, leaving all the cool weapons just left.Story is unique and very interesting one the parts that hold up today with nothing else like itBut this is a game that has aged poorly unlike something like Quake or Morrowind in my opinionNewer players might not see bad because anything bad said about what people consider jesus just gets shunned away, but I do think this game has many issues mostly to do with age, YES THIS COULD BE APPLIED TO ANY GAME, but my opinion has led me to choose this as a poorly aged game.Best bet if your coming into this game fresh look up some gameplay of the main aspects of itIf there was a mid point on steam instead of yes play it or no dont I would put thatIf you can ignore its age your in luck because this game can be greatIf not move onIf your someone who has played this before and love it, why are you looking in the reviews exactlySo im sorry to offend what people consider the second coming of jesus, and you can wipe them tears now			"

The PS1 Spiderman games came out the same year, and they look much better, and play much better.The combat is painfully clunky, and the stealth is unforgiving, which compounds the combat clunkiness. The story is very compelling and interesting, but I can't get through the game to enjoy the story.5/10Note: I just got back from Jedi Outcast, one of the best games of all time.

For the rest of us it's just a little past it's time, and sadly I missed it when it was a current game. I find it much more interesting to watch youtube videos of the 'lets play' where people who actually know the ancient and obscure game mechanics play through. I can't really fault the game for being old but I don't recommend it currently on the same basis of not recommending pong or donkey kong.			"

												I personally am waiting for my refund, and I'll tell you why. Im not going to bring up the graphics, which were good for it's time, but the voice acting is horribly wooden and the ""accents"" of some of the ""foreign"" characters are just plain dumb. The dialougue scenes are very reminiscent of South Park canadians flapping their heads at each other in 90's era Hot Topic cotoure, which is kind of hilarious, but I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to be a parody. If stealth is going to be done, then it must be done well, and this game doesn't stand the test of time. In other words the stealth handles like a cow in a grocery cart. It has a great story, better than any game made in recent years and I don't even have to pause to think about that statement, but so do any number of William Gibson novels and there isn't a metric f**kton of saves and reloads between chapters. I honestly wish there was a novelization of this game so I could just read it, because the actual gameplay feels like a clunky punishment. If memorizing patrol routines is your bread and butter, and you relish the idea of waiting interminably for disposable henchmen to stop nose mining and move somewhere else then your ship is in. Otherwise, read Neuromancer and save yourself a heap of frustration and boredom.			"

												Deus EX-GOTYSee what I did?  This former game of the year is no longer such.  Deus Ex is arguably the most dated game on Steam and in attempt to fool you they stick ""Game of the Year Edition"" at the end of the title.  I don't need to tell you the Deus Ex series is horrible.  Human Revolution for example, a dog turd spray painted completely gold, is one of the worst games of all time.  Seeing how I couldn't even get past the first level I will keep it brief.+It's a videogame+Cyberpunk+Dialogue options-Messy inventory management-Headshots are not insta-kill despite the game telling you it is-Backstabs are not insta-kill-Which make stealth impossible even though that's one of the game's main aspects-Every ""gadget"" intended as a weapon is useless-Uninspiring terrorist plot-Jumping is near pointless since most objects have infinite height.  (You can't jump on a chair)-At times an item will be stuck in your equipped slot and there will be no way to unequip it-No auto-saves-No waypoints -No music whatsoeverAvoid at all costs.			"

												Excellent game complete with equally as excellent  features including; horrible stealth mechanics, crossbows bolts as strong as toothpicks, large open areas full of enemies(perfect for stealth gameplay), voice acting as bland as whole grain toast, almost impossible to accomplish first level, and fighting 20-50 blood-thirsty robots with 0-2 bullets and a tazer as powerful as trying to kill a rhino with a Snicker's bar. Needless to say, this game is a fantastic MUST have to any gamer's collection.			"

												There is only one way to complete the missions - stealth way. Shooting way is too hard even on Easy difficulty. So I would personally recommend this game only for Stealth lovers.Also, for those who like me wanted to see what Deus Ex actually is, I recommend to try Deus Ex: Human Revolution. This is Deus Ex done right. Yeah, the Stealth is still there, but it's not enforced.			"

												For an early pc game, it's pretty good. The problem I had with it though was that at certain points the fps just dove. So much so that the controls were unresponsive and the ai couldn't shoot me. I tried playing on lower graphics settings but there were no changes, leading me to belive that it was just how the game was made. If it ran, I would play it. But it can't, so I won't.			"

												Do people really read these?  It's got a great story, the gameplay is lacking, the graphics are hugely dated, but the AI hasn't aged a day because video game companies forgot that it's possible to update AI since the early 2000s.  Don't buy, pirate.			"

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, ""If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately."" Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 3 thousand26four, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very large sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												Another exaple of the cancer that is killing Steam. Maybe if you still run win 98 or maybe XP, with a dinky little 15"" CRT, you might be able to get something out of this completely forgettable mess. Otherwise find a modern game with modern graphics and an interface that actually responds instead of broken crap like this.  "

												Boring, lacklustre and broken.  Visuals are dated even with some of the very good mods out there.  Game mechanics, AI and physics are poor even using add-ons like GMDX - Ion Storm should have taken some inspiration from Looking Glass Studios on how to do these two years earlier but kudos to the fan modding community for pitching in some seriously great efforts with textures, gameplay and so on.Even overlooking technical details, this game couldn't keep my interest and I tried for over 20 hours.  It is not an engaging or intriguing story and the characters just aren't likable or memorable.Not only would I not recommend this game to a friend, I would not even recommend it to somebody that I don't like.  Getting an old game like this to run on modern hardware is only worthwhile if the game is worthwhile.  This is a turd that cannot be polished.			"

												I was wary when starting this game as it is often described as the best game ever but given its age I wasn't convinced these opinions weren't coloured by nostalgia. Having played through this I can see why people love it but I don't. It doesn't take the usual shoot all the zombies/Nazis/aliens in the face until you win approach it is stealth and tactics focused. You can take very different approaches to get through the levels depending on how you develop your character. It is not an easy game to get into as you are presented with a baffling array of skills with no real idea what will be useful. Once you get the hang of it the game is ok and that is my overall opinion there is nothing wrong with the game (well except the graphics and the voice acting) but there was nothing that made it special. Compared to other games of the era it is way better than shoot everything crap like Quake 3 but it was not as much fun as story based shooters like Return to Castle Wolfenstein or Half Life.			"

												After giving in to the hype I decided to put on my trenchcoat as JC Denton, ready to fight conspiracies. The game is fun, you gain experience, level up abilties and complete missions. The game had so many options though, would I pick rifles? Or Computers? Glad I didn't pick swimming because it's fairly useless.It's a weird combination of a shooter and a roleplaying game but the game is definitely dated, the levels are ugly and everyone looks the same.I always thought it was the same company ""Ion Storm"" that made Diakatana but it turns out there games are good, and certainly stay on schedule.Turns out they made a sequal that no one liked cause they dumbed it down to much.Thick b-astards.

												This game has so many problems. Where do I start?Well. If you have a slow/old computer then this game won't be so bad - because the game speed is heavily effected by FPS. The game was running over 12 times faster than it should have been - when you walked slow - you run. When there is dialogue/story - it skips through it fast and the enemies move quicker, etc. It is such a shame there isn't an FPS limiter on it.			"

												I don't know if it is that the game is 15 years old or what, but the controls are terrible. They do not work in todays controls scheme. For instance, Q E Z C are used to move the camera in the same way the mouse does. This was probably made to accomadate players who did not have a mouse in the year 2000, but everyone has a mouse nowadays and these keys could be put to better use. Also when people tell you graphics do not matter, they do. I feel that the graphical limitations of the time really hamstringed the developers ability to create a cohesive aesthetic so everything ends up looking plasticy in the worst kind of way.			"
