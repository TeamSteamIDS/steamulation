												Did you ever play 'Drug Warz', the game that introduced a generation to the 'buy low, sell high' method of wealth attainment which probably led to the tragic american housing crash of 2008? Did you ever wish that you could have that very game wrapped up in a semi pointless 3D world you could navigate by clicking on someone's name to instantly teleport to them instead of walking all that distance? Did you ever wish that you could do all that and get to utilize those elite twitch shooter skills you gained through endless hours of Quake III Arena while all of your friends left you behind to obtain quality educations, well-paying jobs and loving spouses?I know I did!So when I came across Space Trader: Merchant Marine I knew I'd found the game for me. Marvel at the 2004 era graphics in a game that came out in 2008! (Same year as that housing market crash, I smell the NWO behind this) Throw your hands to the sky when you first break the 7-figure ceiling just by virtue of buying things when they're crashing hard because it's bound to bounce back in the next 48 hours!Weep when you realize your job is terrible, you're lucky if you have thee figures in the bank and rent is coming due, the Illuminati forced the bank to foreclose on your house four years ago, (BECAUSE YOU KNOW TOO MUCH, DAMN IT!) and you aren't actually flitting between the stars flogging over priced Bananabis at every starport between Earth and Cygnus, you're sitting at your computer waiting to die.9.5/10 it's okay from a gameplay persepctive.1/10 for being a front for the Bilderberg group and secretly manipulating the masses, you foolish sheep.

												Honestly, the game completely lacks any and all substance. It's bland, forgettable, boring and tedious.     In the game, you play as an unnamed adventurer/trader, that sets forth to do one thing, become the Master Trader of the known universe/galaxy. One of the first missions is to find some chick that will give you a million credits on loan in order for you to buy a ship and start trading. You have a deadline when to get the million credits needed, and this formula repeats itself several times throughout the game, so much so that even the multiplayer is basically only that. Oh, and no one plays the multiplayer. In order to GET the million credits, you have to buy some commodities on Earth, and go to the Moon (which is just clicking a button) and selling your merchandise. Or you can do contracts. More on that later.      The trading system is very simple. You get to one of the merchants, you see the commodities they have for sale, and you buy it. There is a bar graph showcasing whether the market price for the item is declining or not, however the graph is pretty much nonsense, seeing as there's no trend whatsoever, and seems to be entirely, 100% random. To add to that, the trading is a pretty pathetic source of income, as even if you get lucky, you won't really earn a huge profit on anything you sell.      You can also find random commodities strewn throughout the worlds you find yourself, so there's no real reason to actually BUY commodities, as you'll find some semi-valuable stuff just laying on the floor in the map, free for the taking. Items range from wool to fetuses and radioactive metals and whatnot, and the ""illegal"" stuff is more valuable than the legitimate trading commodities. The game doesn't punish you for owning or selling illegal commodities, which was a wasted opportunity for some amusing gameplay as an actual smuggler. Shame.        The second source of money is through doing contracts or helping people out with arduous tasks. To get a contract, you have to go to the bar, where the barman will give you a target which you have to kill. This is where the game gets a slight instance of gameplay, by introducing an FPS arena, however, this falls flat as well, because the gunplay is so barebones it physically hurts to play through the FPS stages. The missions where you help people out aren't much better, as the case often is that you're simply collecting or buying X commodity and bringing it to some random dude or chick. Again, incredibly tedious.Also, the game came out 2008 if I'm not wrong. I originally thought it came out around 1999, when Freelancer came out, but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥2008????????????????????????????????       The music is obnoxious and not memorable in any way (read: elevator music), it features abysmal graphics, the little mechanics the game has are horribly unrefined, the economic system is non functioning, trading is next to useless unless you get some very rare, expensive commodities from missions, and the entire game feels like a chore.Overall, I'd give it a 3/10, would not recommend unless you have literally nothing else to do in your life.

												Space Trader is a very casual trader game.  You mostly trade stuff and try to make as much profit as possible in a predifined timelimit. Trading side is like playing the old drug wars but it has some extra quests dialogs and events added. On top of that there are bounties you can collect which take you to combat mode. If you catch the target, it's just more money. Additionally you will occationally get boarded by officials who try to make you pay taxes. If you are greedy, you will try and fight em, which will make the game even more interesting. Hard Stakes =) While the basic game is easy, the challenges can feel ridicilously hard giving something extra to the game.If you are looking for something special you will definitely be disappointed, but I found it to be a fun and easy going game.

												This game blows. The idea is great, but the execution is just plain awefull. I understand this is an indie title, but the graphics, gameplay, sound, just everything suck. Travelling between planets is just a click, you never even see your spaceship takeoff. The npc's look lifeless, and never change their facial expression. The enviroments are small and boring. The shooter levels are almost all the same, and play like a shovelware crap shooter. No strategy or anything. You cannot buy weapons for the fps stages, but you can by generic crates of weapons to trade. This is beyond dumb. I can't believe anybody enjoyed this game.			"

												Strangely likeable despite being somewhat terrible. The trading side of the game is solid and fun if lacking a little in inventory. Unfortunately it also has a really crappy FPS element to it which definitely lets it down as a whole. That aside, I find it quite enjoyable and the price is low enough that it serves its purpose as a timekiller. Your mileage may vary.			"

												If you just want something to kill time then its an ok game, very basic FPS scenarios that you can do when collecting bounties and such in missions and basic buy cheap/sell for a profit system...the only downside to this game is there is not a sandbox mode...which ends up making the game dull and redundant when you have to start from scratch every time you complete a mission.Def not worth the full price...worth the 49 cents I paid for it while on sale.

												Space Trader Merchant Marine was released in Oct 23, 2008. It boasts a score of 89% from a review by GameFocus saying, """"One of the best indie games of 2008. An innovative and addictive experience. Addictive, very fun and innovative are the best words to describe the game and the bottom line is this is a welcome addition to any gamer's library so buy this game and enjoy it.""This is very akin to the how 'reviews' reflected Bubsy 3D on its own packaging, to those that remember.The game is broken down into four different areas, exploration, trading, time management, and fighting/bounty hunting.The exploration is very limited, your only goal being to find crates of goods floating about, merchants, and the bar keep. The problem is that once you've gone through it once, you know where it all is, no variation, same boring bland walls, ect., and it honestly starts to feel like a chore.The time management is very simple. Go to X location from y location = z time spent. You have a set amount of time in every 'chapter' to complete a set $$$ quota. Besides the time spent traveling through the travel menu, any time spent at a location does not diminish the time that you have left. And as thus, does not really give you any time pressure.The trading is a joke, as, all you do it buy what's not doing well, and travel, and get guaranteed profit. It hardly reflects actual market value in the real world and makes the game largely unchallenging.The fighting/bounty hunting is terribly bland and cycles through the same maps. Stupid AI, overpowered guns, and cheap kills, makes it horrid.Now, all that said, this was made in 2008, 2-0-0-8, to be sure. Other games that were made in this period were:Fable 2 Fallout 3 LittleBIGPlanet Rock Band 2Gears Of War 2 SporeGrand Theft Auto IVNo More HeroesLeft 4 DeadProfessor Layton & The Curious Village Compared to that list, the time period the game was released, and actual content in the game... it makes it look mediocre, a joke, something that belongs in a 2000 release.

												Space Trader Merchant Marine is that strange situation where two very different genres have been combined together in the hope of hitting that once in a lifetime combination that everybody agrees is pure genius, like Vampires and Teenagers, or Ninjas and Cheerleaders. Space Trader doesn't quite hit that special recipe however.Space Trader is a combination of a numbers trading simulator and a first person shooter and by far and large the biggest problem is that playing the game you have trouble telling which of these two aspects feel the most tacked on.The trading part of the game is simple enough. You travel between various planets in the solar system, each planet has a a few merchants each selling a few goods. You buy as much as your bank account and cargo space will allow and then travel to the next world. Space Trader has no real in game economy however and everything is decided by the almighty Random Number Generator. The challenge of choosing which products to buy is virtually non-existent as all items for sale lists how below normal market value they are next to their name. There is also a legal/non-legal system in place however it has no real effect in game making the actual buying and selling of products extremely dull and predictable.You explore the various locations on foot, in a first person shooter aspect. The various trade hubs allow you run around a small area, collecting various sellable items littered about the place, trade with the local merchants and take on a number of missions. The missions mostly come down to ""Bring X items"", ""Transport X items"" or, the more common, shooter mission. The majority of the missions in the game, and perhaps one of the easiest ways to make money early on in the campaigns is the various bounty missions which are your basic FPS. You spawn in one of a few predetermined maps, kill a few henchmen and eventually a boss will spawn. All the while you can pick up loot that you can sell out in the proper game, and weapons, health and shields that'll help you on this mission only. The shooting is fairly poorly implemented, even for it's time. The weapons feel like pellet guns, the enemy AI is non-existent and the whole experience usually boils down to just sniping at enemies from around a corner.The music throughout the game is a high speed techno beat that, while I am sure some of you will love it, made me play with the sound off after a few sessions. There is no voice-acting and very little ambiance. Even gun shots and hit sounds leave much to be desired. Graphically the game is nothing to write home about but not much below what you would expect from an indie title either.All in all, Space Trader Merchant Marine is a game that tries to do two things and fails at doing either in an acceptable fashion. It's not a very good trading simulation and not a very good shooter. It doesn't sound or look very good and it doesn't feel very good. This is a game that can easily be skipped.			"

												This game is ok, so long as you understand that it is a very basic economic game with a little FPS thrown in.  What sucks about this game is that your money resets after each section.  So do not get a good  sales route going thinking that you will have some extra cash to play with after you close out the level you are on.			"

												Ever since I played the original Starflight, I've always had a soft spot for space trading type games. While Space Trader: Merchant Marine has a good trading foundation, it feels severely unpolished and overly repetitious. The game is essentially a hybrid shooter with trading elements. The gameplay is fun, but after the second chapter, you've pretty much done everything there is to do. I'd say most people will get bored with it after the first couple hours. The graphics are definitely dated, the limited voices are horribly comical, and the music does not fit the game at all. With another 6-12 months of polish, this game could have been decent. As it stands now, it is completely forgettable.			"

												Remember that game Drug Wars that you'd play on your TI-83?This is it.Okay, so its not exactly the same.  But all the basics are there.  You buy stuff and then go somewhere else to sell it in hopes of making a profit.  There isn't a whole lot else to this game worth mentioning.  There is a shooter element tossed in that just feels clunky and out of place, that I personally just avoided as much as possible.If you want to hone your trading skills before stepping into the TF2 Trading Market, then go ahead and get this game.  But if you never play it, you're not missing out on anything. "

												At first this game seems like fun, especially for its low price. While I admit that I enjoy playing it, there is a ridiculously unfair difficulty spike during the FPS missions. Basically, anytime you have to go kill someone, you get tossed into this terrible FPS minigame where the guns are crap, your controls are crap, and the AI is beyond unfair.Worst of all, if you fail an important FPS mission, you have to travel to another planet, then return to the previous planet to attempt the mission again, thus wasting a lot of time (the game uses time units to create an artificial challenge). I don't have a problem with that, except in the third chapter you are forced to make $20,000,000 for this woman who put a bomb on your ship. After you make the $20,000,000 you get an option to kill her instead. If you fail at killing her you have to travel away to reset the mission. But what happened to me is when I traveled away I ended up running out of time and failed the entire chapter.The reason I kept failing to kill her is because she is unfairly strong (combined with the crappy FPS gameplay and unfair AI). But what I don't understand is that the game plays off your failure as though you actually failed, and not as though it's just resetting you back before you attempted the mission. So why doesn't she just blow up your ship? If your failure happens in real time then she should be aware that you're trying to kill her and it would make sense for her to just blow up your ship and kill you - except she doesn't. But the time factor still remains and you can still lose by running out of time (remember the time limit was for you to make $20,000,000 for the woman you're now trying to kill).I don't know, maybe it's because I'm fresh off a rage quit, but the unfair FPS gameplay and unfair use of the time restrictions really♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. I was honestly enjoying the game up until it pulled this crap..			"

												It's a trading game where you're inexplicably asked to kill a guy to get your ship, then tells you afterwards you can take bounty missions. Bounty missions have infinitely respawning enemies that do lots of damage to you. Trading appears to simply be buying something with a red arrow on one planet, then selling it someplace with a green arrow on the other planet. There does not appear to be any space travel, just a quick cutscene warp.If this game becomes amazing a couple hours in, I'll never know about it because there was nothing there to hold my interest that long.

												You kind of already know what you're getting into when you're considering buying this game. Yes it's a budget indie title probably made by one person, this is nowhere near mass effect level. Now keeping that in mind this is a good game.For what it is it's very interesting, you have an alright trading and buying/selling system where you can walk around in a first person environment finding sellable materials and objects and you can sell them to random merchants who have their own independent prices. It sounds really boring but it's pretty easy and simple, buy low and sell high, there are stars next to amazing selling opportunities so it isn't super difficult.So you buy and sell stuff to earn enough money to pay off debts, you can also earn money through hunting down bounties.This is the coolest part of the game, you get to go into a Quake 3 Arena style FPS where you kill goons and lackeys until the bounty appears and you have to shoot him down, you have to pick up better weapons, health, shields, and sellable materials in this mode, it's a simple arena style FPS, but it's still fun.This game is an alright budget indie experience, it is not worth $5.00, but for $0.50 it's fun enough that I would reccomend it.

												PresentationSteam Sales are always a great way to buy more games than you'll ever be able to play, but between all the big purchases you will often find some random games to keep you busy when there's nothing else; Space Trader: Merchant Marine is exactly that kind of game, but unlike most small, indie games this one managed somehow to keep me around more than it should have, just because at its core, it's an addictive experience. The premise of the game is simple: you are a new trader trying to find your way in this business and since you don't own a ship yet you need to find someone who is willing to give you one. What follows is a simple story and you will see the little twists coming from miles away, but even with that in mind, the missing excitement of what's going to happen next isn't the thing that will keep you around. The campaign has only five chapters and once you understand the mechanics of the game you will have no problem making millions from trading food stamps, oil or even organs. This game simulates the stocks trades perfectly, following the same: buy low, sell high premise, and even though at first it may be hard to figure out how to make all those millions, once you get the idea, it will be only profit for you from that point on. There's no real reward for doing this except the fact that once you reach a goal you will advance to the next chapter and start all over, trading between different planets, but that little sense of advancement is what will keep you playing.Rating: 5.5GameplayThe gameplay in Space Trader is pretty straight forward: you start on a planet and you have to buy commodities that will bring a profit and travel to another planet to sell them at a higher price, keeping a constant watch on the time limit that each mission has, calculating the profit per shipment and the travel time in order to choose the best option. Finding good deals is easy since those always have a gold star indicating that you should buy them, so eventually it becomes just a matter of having enough money in your pocket or enough cargo space, and your only enemy becomes the time as you carefully have to choose where to sell the stuff you just bought. You can make money by taking bounty missions from bartenders or by completing small tasks for different people, so it's always a good idea to talk with everybody because you might find out some interesting things or take on some missions that will give you some extra cash. The shooting mechanic feels old, but that's probably why it feels so addictive at the same time, as you will most likely instantly connect the dots between those shooting sequences and games like Doom, and even though all those bounty missions will get boring pretty soon as each map looks and feels the same and there are only two to three different types of enemies plus the target that you're supposed to assassinate, it is a good distraction from the boring buy and sell mechanic that the game generally delivers.Rating: 6GraphicsIf you look at this game you will assume it was released in the early 2000's because it looks like it was made a generation ago; from the simple and stiff characters to the environments everything looks pretty bad and the repetitive level design doesn't help either. By the end of the game you will know every corner of each planet, you will start to love a certain section for how easy it is to complete a combat mission and you will hate another for how difficult it is.Rating: 5AudioThe sound in this game ain't exactly bad, but it's simply mediocre at best. The voice acting is horrible, but the soundtrack manages to save it sometimes, especially in the heat of a battle, but otherwise there is nothing that stands out, it simply gets boring as you will end up ignoring the other characters or laugh at how bad they sound no matter the serious, story essential thing they just said. There are intentional comic lines too, such as the robot that answers by saying WTF, but those only make the entire thing feel worse, as the game is undecided between trying to be serious and making fun of itself.Rating: 5ExtrasAfter completing the main campaign you can also try the challenge mode that offers three extra missions that are pretty easy to complete and the only real challenge comes when you try to get the achievements, and if you're into that the game can get interesting and it has even some decent replay value as you can spend up to 18 hours struggling to complete everything. It's also supposed to have a multiplayer mode, which puts you and a friend in a race to get the most cash from those challenge missions, but after an hour of banging my head against the wall I couldn't figure out a way of making it work.Rating: 5VerdictWhen a game is getting such a low score no one would actually recommend buying it, but in this case I'll make an exception: you should give it a try if it's on sale and you can get it for less than an euro, as for that amount of money it will keep you busy more than enough to justify the purchase. It is in no way a great game, one that you will remember after leaving it aside, but as long as you play it you will be entertained simply because it's so stupid it becomes like a good parody.Rating Overall: 5.3			"

												Okay.Yes, it's an 'old' game from five years ago, so you can argue that the graphics shouldn't be expected to be cutting edge...but the modelling and textures and the like look considerably WORSE than Unreal - a game that came out _ten_years_before_ Space Trader: Merchant Marine.I admit that I'm a fan of Elite-style games: a hybrid of space flight/combat and trading simulation - WC:Privateer, X: Beyond the Frontier, Freelancer, Frontier: Elite II, etc....this is NOT that type of hybrid, despite the implication of the title. This game tries to weld FPS and trading together, and does NOT do a very good job with EITHER.1) The trading is simplistic, static and easily exploited.For each 'sector', there are a small handful of commodities, only a similar number of bases/trading hubs to buy and sell the same at, so you could probably chart out all the prices on a Post-It™ note...or even commit the best 'trading routes' to even a dodgy, old and  forgetful memory.And you won't have to worry about breaking the economy with your efforts - apparently each base has such large demands and supplies of EVERY commodity that even a huge shipment moved by yourself has NO effect on prices on either end of your run.  Your only restriction to making money is finding the best profit margin, and the size of your cargo hold (& working capital)....but hey; you don't even really need to worry about trading to get up these thinly-justified goals for earning - a) you can usually find piles of items just sitting in nooks and corners on the trading hub maps, which you can then sell to collectors for a decent starting stake, b) you can also pick up a considerable amount of cash from doing the bounty (aka FPS) missions - not always from the up-front wages of that, but from looting commodities from the 'hideout' of whatever low-life you're supposed to assassinate.2) As others have said, the FPS is similarly unchallenging - the maps are limited in quantity and variety, the 'power ups' are uninspired (and ephemeral), and the opposing AI is laughable, resulting in no point in any gameplay strategy apart from sneaking quickly to a good vantage point and then sniping everyone just aimlessly standing around.As such, you have two poor component-games, that barely feel like they should even belong together; the overall story is threadbare and challenges even the most credulous willing suspension of disbelief.Normally, I have very low standards to play a game (gfx, music, v/o, story, etc.) but this game managed to sink below even those unchallenging requirements.Do not even bother with this on a steam sale - the ONLY reasonable justification I could say for buying this game would be to bump up your XP from sheer quantity of game-ownership, and even then, a heavy discount would be necessary....but even so, I would under NO account EVER suggest you PLAY this 'game'...

												The basic principle in this game is: buy low, sell high. Unfortunately there aren't that many things to buy and sell, but nevertheless the concept of trading and traveling between space stations is quite well implemented and works. This part is relatively easy, and once you get the hang of the game you'll see the numbers in your bank account grow exponentially. If you need some extra cash you can try your hand at bountyhunting, which teleports you to one of a series of FPS arenas where you get to shoot people. Very basic but enjoyable while it lasts.The biggest annoyance I found in this game is the lack of a sandbox / open-ended mode. The game is divided up into missions, guiding you through the stages of development for your very own space trading enterprise, but after each mission you basically start over.Other than that, this game is a lot of fun to play and although it won't be able to keep your attention forever (it can get a bit repetitive over time) it is a fun little game and a great timekiller if you have nothing to do for a couple of hours. The price is already fairly low, and if you can get this game in a sale like I did you basically just can't go wrong.			"

												A game that mixes trading and FPS shooting. This may sound really good game but nom beliie me, it isn't.First of all, everything is so bad about this game. The graphics, voice acting, musics and of course the gameplay itself. The gameplay is pretty much scavenging for stuff (and by stuff I mean anything you can sell, like wigs or drugs. Great game to teach yo kids to deal drugs.) and selling them to guys who pay the most and buying stuff from them and then trading them to someone who pays more and... Well, you get the idea. Oh, and every now and then you get to shoot somebody.Speaking of that, the FPS parts are terrbile. This game would have been much better without the shooting parts even though the trading is borinf and repetitive.Not worth the 50 cents I used to buy this game. One of the few games I entirely regret buying.			"

PresentationSteam Sales are always a great way to buy more games than you'll ever be able to play, but between all the big purchases you will often find some random games to keep you busy when there's nothing else; Space Trader: Merchant Marine is exactly that kind of game, but unlike most small, indie games this one managed somehow to keep me around more than it should have, just because at its core, it's an addictive experience. The premise of the game is simple: you are a new trader trying to find your way in this business and since you don't own a ship yet you need to find someone who is willing to give you one. What follows is a simple story and you will see the little twists coming from miles away, but even with that in mind, the missing excitement of what's going to happen next isn't the thing that will keep you around. The campaign has only five chapters and once you understand the mechanics of the game you will have no problem making millions from trading food stamps, oil or even organs. This game simulates the stocks trades perfectly, following the same: buy low, sell high premise, and even though at first it may be hard to figure out how to make all those millions, once you get the idea, it will be only profit for you from that point on. There's no real reward for doing this except the fact that once you reach a goal you will advance to the next chapter and start all over, trading between different planets, but that little sense of advancement is what will keep you playing.Rating: 5.5GameplayThe gameplay in Space Trader is pretty straight forward: you start on a planet and you have to buy commodities that will bring a profit and travel to another planet to sell them at a higher price, keeping a constant watch on the time limit that each mission has, calculating the profit per shipment and the travel time in order to choose the best option. Finding good deals is easy since those always have a gold star indicating that you should buy them, so eventually it becomes just a matter of having enough money in your pocket or enough cargo space, and your only enemy becomes the time as you carefully have to choose where to sell the stuff you just bought. You can make money by taking bounty missions from bartenders or by completing small tasks for different people, so it's always a good idea to talk with everybody because you might find out some interesting things or take on some missions that will give you some extra cash. The shooting mechanic feels old, but that's probably why it feels so addictive at the same time, as you will most likely instantly connect the dots between those shooting sequences and games like Doom, and even though all those bounty missions will get boring pretty soon as each map looks and feels the same and there are only two to three different types of enemies plus the target that you're supposed to assassinate, it is a good distraction from the boring buy and sell mechanic that the game generally delivers.Rating: 6GraphicsIf you look at this game you will assume it was released in the early 2000's because it looks like it was made a generation ago; from the simple and stiff characters to the environments everything looks pretty bad and the repetitive level design doesn't help either. By the end of the game you will know every corner of each planet, you will start to love a certain section for how easy it is to complete a combat mission and you will hate another for how difficult it is.Rating: 5AudioThe sound in this game ain't exactly bad, but it's simply mediocre at best. The voice acting is horrible, but the soundtrack manages to save it sometimes, especially in the heat of a battle, but otherwise there is nothing that stands out, it simply gets boring as you will end up ignoring the other characters or laugh at how bad they sound no matter the serious, story essential thing they just said. There are intentional comic lines too, such as the robot that answers by saying WTF, but those only make the entire thing feel worse, as the game is undecided between trying to be serious and making fun of itself.Rating: 5ExtrasAfter completing the main campaign you can also try the challenge mode that offers three extra missions that are pretty easy to complete and the only real challenge comes when you try to get the achievements, and if you're into that the game can get interesting and it has even some decent replay value as you can spend up to 18 hours struggling to complete everything. It's also supposed to have a multiplayer mode, which puts you and a friend in a race to get the most cash from those challenge missions, but after an hour of banging my head against the wall I couldn't figure out a way of making it work.Rating: 5VerdictWhen a game is getting such a low score no one would actually recommend buying it, but in this case I'll make an exception: you should give it a try if it's on sale and you can get it for less than an euro, as for that amount of money it will keep you busy more than enough to justify the purchase. It is in no way a great game, one that you will remember after leaving it aside, but as long as you play it you will be entertained simply because it's so stupid it becomes like a good parody.Rating Overall: 5.3Check the full review and a lot more about Space Trader: Merchant Marine at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=233 "

												Fun game and pretty cheap. The one problem I have with it is the chapter setup makes it seem rather limiting and you seem to lose all progress between the chapters.That said, its fun for what it is. The bounty missions are a nice change, explore mode (i.e. walking around) has some nice suprises in it and trading (the reason I played in the first place) works well and is what I expected.So buy, play, enjoy, just don't expect a deep several hundred hour trading game.

												10 our of 10 for this amazing title. It grips you from the first moment when you are left beaten and bloodied in a back alley of a traders asteroid to the climatic battle between you and the shadown orgnization that holds your family captive. Graphics are very detailed and immersive, with dx11 really shining here. Be prepared to have a powerfull system though, an i7 chipset with 6g ddr3 can barely handle this powerhorse. Sound is crisp with realistic detail coming though in every action you take, from the smallest rustle of papers on a desk to awe inspiring explosions ripping a frieghter hull apart.   So in conclusion, if you want a game with endless replayability, insane customization, rpg style progression, an advanced ai that will have you cursing your screen and The best damn campaign probably eve, then give Stmm a try.

												Space Trader: Merchant Marine is a bipolar game.  On the one hand, it tries to capture gamer interest as a commodities trading game, where you would buy and sell different commodities seeking to make a profit.  Yet, the game developers seem to realize the major flaw with this game--it gets boring quickly.  So they made a hackneyed attempt to spruce it up by adding a bulky, vastly inferior First Person Shooter component with graphics that are reminiscent of Doom.  I think the developers should have focused solely on the trading aspect, because consumers do realize the commodity trading simulation is the major draw of this game, and certainly not the FPS aspect.  How would I improve the commodity trading aspect?  I would offer unlockable merchants when certain conditions are met (i.e. a million dollars worth of legit inventory, or x number of cargo holds added to your ship), or create another category of goods.  What about the trader's personal reputation? What if the trader's reputation changes over time, as he deals in certain types of goods, and that influences pricing of wares from the NPC merchants?  These are some simple ways to spice up the trading simulation, and I'm sure the game developers could implement these additions quite easily.As it stands now, the game will capture your interest only until you get bored and tired of the commodity trading aspect.  How long will depend on personal tastes.			"

												If you're looking for a good FPS, this is NOT the game to run to. The controls are clunky, the weapons barely do anything at all to your enemies, the enemies to way too much damage to you, and unless you grind up to 1000 shields, you won't last ten seconds in the combat segments. The HUD isn't well thought-out either, using numbers instead of bars or icons for your health and shields, forcing you to take a crucial moment to read out your health and shields while the grunts pound them away. The graphics aren't appealing, either. The characters look only semi-realistic, fitting into the ""Uncanny Valley"" making them look actually really creepy, and the world models are too blocky and low-res to be serious-looking. The story just feels like an excuse plot, too. This game is definitely NOT worth the $4.99 normal price. If anything, 50 cents feels just about right for the little time and effort that was put into this game. Seriously, there must have been NO playtesting at all on this. The only thing I do like is the trading, and even then it's not enough to save this game. 2/10.			"

												Stay away... No free mode, just campaign. All you do is grab free stuff lying around the planet for free money, load your ship with the most steeply discounted commodity (infinite stock, static prices), and make millions flying it to the closest planet. Missions are lame. All you do is talk to people and walk around to find an item/person. There's also combat, which is a bad quake clone with abysmal AI. They devastate at close distances, but at long range they're pathetic. Radar means they can't sneak up on you. They won't even attack you 90% of the time you're on a different floor, so snipe away with the assault rifle and you automatically win. You have limited time to reach the campaign's money goal (money disappears after chapter), and time passes depending on the distance you travel. If it wasn't for the missions sending you to certain planets, you could just travel between two close planets. No economy to speak of, reused maps, and no space flight/combat. Lame.			"

The creators have put a lot of effort in the dialogs and storyline and thanks to the creative trading-and-exploring-system in this game, the player realy get a feeling of  making an impact on the bigger happenings of the solar system.Completed with many easter eggs, novel references and other secrets (like shipdriver Jamal) that can only be discovered by true fans of the ST:MM-saga this truely is a worthy game of the great storyline.

You also only have the ability to copy, delete or quit the console, quitting quits, copying does nothing, and neither does delete. You also can't even type into the console, so it's not even a very good typing simulator. If you like to pretend to be a professional haxor by looking at a console, then this is the game for you.

												I couldn't resist picking this game up for 49 cents just to see how bad it was. I wasn't disappointed! Have you ever heard of that movie The Room? It's supposed to be the Citizen Cane of bad films. Well if that's true, Space Trader is the Mass Effect 2 of terrible space games.It's hard to even describe exactly what makes this game so bad. Some games are so buggy or broken or just unplayable that they accumulate terrible reviews. Not Space Trader, it works totally fine! I couldn't find a single bug. Its problem is just a complete lack of ambition at every level. Everything about it is just earnest, straightforward and completely incompetent. It's almost like it wasn't made by a person at all but by an outside observer of the human condition - someone who just fundamentally misunderstands why humans enjoy things. Like, I don't know, a Martian or a hyper-intelligent dog or a robot from an 80's movie.The main mechanic of the game is an arbitrage simulator, kind of like Drug Wars - you know, that game for the TI82 graphing calculator that you could play in math class without getting in trouble? The main difference is that in Space Trader, it's pretty much on autopilot since the game marks the good deals for you. Also it's not about drugs, it's about such exciting futuristic commodities as ""Manufactured Goods"" and ""Copper Ore.""The combat mechanic is even worse. It's floaty and unreal, like trying to go back and play an old sprite based shooter from 1993. True this isn't a brand new game, but it is from 2008. That's the year Bioshock came out. Think about that for a second. Space Trader's gameplay was out of date by over a decade even back then.I think my favorite ridiculous detail about the game is in the dialogue. They got the perspective wrong, so when you're talking to the lumpy NPCs, you seem to be at about their nipple level. Sometimes... lower. If you have two quarters burning a hole in your pocket and you want to see just how bad this game is, give it a shot. On the other hand, you could just use the quarters to do your laundry instead. The Room is available on Netflix if you need something awful to watch while you fold.			"

												Wow, never have I played a game so visceral, benevolant and heart-warming. If you're a fan of the movie Gravity, stop what you're doing AND PLAY THIS GAME NOW! It's a mix between the mindblowing space scenes in Gravity and the seedy underground stock market in Wolf of Wall Street; add in a little bit of Goodfellas and Alien: Resurrection and you have Space Trader (A formula for success in my books).People say that games can never be a form of art, but Space Trader will prove everyone wrong. No doubt a cult classic that will sure catch on with the masses. You all want HL3? How about ST2!?  "

												Space Trader: Merchant Marine, I do not understand how you got 89% from Game Focus...The title sounds like one of those old school space trading games. Let me tell you that this game does not involve space in the slightest. The screenshots give you an extremely misleading view on the game, I read all the negative reviews, but i thought it just looked like plain classic awesomeness. I was really dissapointed.The only goal in this game is to sell random things. The stock market doesn't even make sense in this game either, the graphs show the possible profit, but they aren't even real, they're just there to make it look a bit cooler. I got this game for 40p, I think, and I feel as if I wasted way to much money on this. It does involve some shooter parts, but these are as bland as the trading itself. The guns you are provided with have no ability to upgrade, and you have no choice as to what gun you get. It's like a really, really, really bad Quake 3 Arena. Just don't get it. Do yourself a favour and go buy a bar of chocolate or something.			"

												At First it seems like a nice game to play, but, If you are looking for a ""Space sim"", this is not your type of game.Some FPS missions are broken by infinite respawns which makes it insanely hard to capture their Boss. The Challenge Mode is insanely difficult to unlock the other missions.Co-op mode is only for Challenge mode. So don't bother buying this game for Co-op.This game is pretty hard for kids, so it is not recommended for Kids even though it is rate E.			"

												This game in my opinion isn't too bad despite its age and graphics. But then again some people might get turned off by this game's gameplay or the graphics. I just wish that there was a neutral button instead of choosing positive or negative. This game heavily replies on your trading skills. If your trading skills are at a life-time low then this game might not be for you. Also this game has some FPS action but that only happens on the bounty hunt missions and the ship defending random encounters  (the ship defending random encounters will most likely to happen during chapter 5 of this game	. All in all, only buy this game during a sale and only if you're mostly interested in playing trading games/ somewhat FPS games.  Now do I recommend this game? Full price? No. Discounted price? Maybe. Heavily Discounted price? Absolutely yes! Just..... buy this game whenever it goes on sale...... xD			"

												Not a bad attempt to recapture the awesomeness that was Privateer, but the game lacks character development, engaging story, and the ability to just do what you want, when you want like Privateer did. I got this one on a huge sale (like, a few dollars) and I wouldn't have wanted to pay more.biggest design flaw is how the game is broken down into ""you need X amount of credits to pay your debt in 3 weeks"" and while you can do whatever you want in those 3 weeks, if you dont have enough credits, you have to REPLAY THE CHAPTER.Id have to vote no on this one not because its a horrible game, but because it didn't give me enough reason to recommend it.

												My experience in this game so far is best characterized by an interesting, persistant bug, that probably has something to do with my oddly-sized screen resolution.  There is a custom mouse cursor, and the part of it that I click with is about a finger's width above the top of the displayed cursor.IE, I must hover my mouse about a quarter inch below a dialogue option until it highlights, to be able to click on it.This is the level of care and precision that I'm finding in this game.  Decent concept, feels vaguely Mass Effect-y, with more trading and less talking.  Not very complicated.  Could have been polished a bit more.  You could probably waste an afternoon with it, if you wanted to.			"

												This game had such an interesting premise, and such interesting potential. I wish I could reccomend it, but alas, it's faults outshine what it gets right. Despite the name of the game being ""Space Trader"", the most valuable and worthwhile jobs are actually bounty hunting jobs. And to say that the combat is lacking is an understatement. The campaign mode resets your progress at the end of each chapter, eliminating any cargo or money beyond the final objective that you managed to save, as well as eliminaing all incomplete quests. The idea of growth and becoming a better and more important trader should have carried, but because of the artificial reset, fell very flat. I stopped playing the campaign after seeing my progression removed for no reason.And the free for all mode is lacking: from what I can tell, there is a mode that is basically unlimited time and complete freedom, but in order to get it, you have to beat the first challenge which is impossibly difficult. If even one of these issues were different, I would consider playing again, as the premise is solid and fun, but the execution here is not worth the time.			"

												|   11240 | Space Trader is a interesting idea of a indie game, travel around the galaxy and make profit, too bad the execution is not as well done, still a fun game for a few hours.In this game you are a nameless trader who just got the license to trade, but all you need is a ship, and so across 5 chapters you get to become the master traders dealing with corrupt officers, betrayals, and trade wars.The graphics are somewhat ok for a indiegame and the music is not bad but there's only 2-3 songs at all.The trade mechanics is very simple you buy stuff and go sell it at another planet for profit studying random events like drug busts making drug kind of items sell for higher and etc, but if this was a real trade game you would be able to negotiate for a better profit, you can't in this game.You can also partake in bounties, or fight the guards scanning your ship for illegal stuff in a simple fps kind of like unreal tournament, but not even close to good, still it does it's job.For 5 dollars this game is maybe worth it if you ran out of stuff to play, but you're probably better off buying it during a sale or bundle for less than a dollar.

												Clunky, predictable and casually easy. It's a nice way to kill time if you like to travel from one planet to another meeting demand with supply and occasionally finding a funny Internet reference or fighting some mean guys with guns.I had bought it in some bundle with at least half a dozen other games - I feel I payed the right price for it. I don't think I could recommend this game at $5, but I can think of much worse things to spend $5 on.I beat the final Challenge with ~$65m out of the necessary $25m without over-analyzing things - it's that kind of an ""easy game."" Don't play it to be challenged or amazed, it's more of a relaxing First Person game.Couldn't find anyone to play multiplayer with - so I don't know if that makes the game any more challenging.Don't expect to learn a whole lot about trading from this game unless you've simply never heard of ""buy low, sell high"" and pay-attention-to-when-the-game-tells-you-something-is-ridiculously-more-valuable-on-another-planet-before-you-get-there. Also, you need to spend money to make money - you won't get rich in this game if you piddle around with the least expensive commodities.c:P.S. Jenn Falkos looks like a blow-up sex doll			"

												Part trading game, part FPS, it fails at both.  The trading element lacks any subtlety or deeper strategy than ""buy low, sell high.""  The FPS portion is incredibly repetitive with laughable graphics and mechanics.  It's hard to believe this game came out in 2008.  In 2008, you could buy Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and it looks light years better than this.  This game barely compares to games that came out a decade earlier (think Half-Life).  Save your money - if you want to do space trading, go dust off your copy of Freelancer or X Rebirth; if you want a shooter, go download pretty much any other game that involves a firearm.			"

												The game is locked to a selection of low resolutions, the textures, animations and audio are all downright poor. The gameplay is fairly uninteresting. There's little to recommend it, except that it does occasionally have some pretty scenery.You can check out my first impressions here:

												Not bad at all. It's like basic version of X series, Freelancer and Freespace without a ship driving option. You experience everything in first-person view. There is a campaign mode called as challenges and you have to be successful in an exact time given to you. Most of game is about trading stuff between planets but there is also bounty missions to get into some action. In bounty missions you can use some weapons, eliminate guards and finally the boss in some multiplayer-kind of small levels.Also the artwork of the game extremely inspired(!) from Ground Control 2.You should try the game if you find it really cheap (in Indie Bundles or some other Indie game-seller sites). You can also feel first few years of 2000's while playing this game.			"

												No. no. no. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Ok, let's start with the beginning. I was just about ready to let off the fact that this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game should've been an iOS game all along, yeah, it's THAT complex, but ok, I let that slide, I said, why not give it a chance. And from then on, it NEVER STOPPED DISAPPOINTING! I would need a whole ♥♥♥♥ing book to detail precisely what's wrong with this game, but I'll try to keep it short. You never know what the ♥♥♥♥ are you doing. The game is never clear when it gives you a mission, the ""quest log"" which is a two line snippet of every mission on the ESCAPE SCREEN is ♥♥♥♥ing laughable at. NO INFORMATION WHAT SO EVER! You don't know where to go to find the person, it just say ""HE'S ON THE MOON"", well gee, ♥♥♥♥ING THANKS THEN! The ""planets"" themselves are a ♥♥♥♥ing joke, it's only one level the size of your average living room... And even then you can't find who you're supposed to talk to to finish your damn quest. Logical conclusion, MANY QUESTS ARE BROKEN! The ""trading"" part of the game, which is it's main gimmick is simple as hell, but guess what, no information there as well, I couldn't figure out what the ♥♥♥♥ the information it gives me on the screen is, and I'm not that dumb in real life, I got a good results diploma every year in high-school, but still, this game is a complete mistery to me. Interwoven along the ""trading"" part is some random shooting sections thrown out of nowhere, as a result of some ""missions"" you pick up randomly from strangers... you get insta-teleported to the ""mission area"" and ista-teleported back when you kill a guy. That's about as deep as the missions go. ALL OF THEM, hit missions, ""kill this guy"". Gun play is TERRIBLE, enemies bullet spongy as ♥♥♥♥, is basically DOOM with better graphics, let's put it that way. You CAN NOT save them game when you want, it has it's own stupid auto-save at the worst times mechanic, and then when you fail the main chapter mission, IT RESTARTS THE WHOLE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ CHAPTER, god forbit it takes you to the previous auto-save. That was the drop that filled the glass. I lost HOURS of progress because of it's stupid MORONIC saving system. This game is a royal mess. It doesn't know what it wants to be, it tries to be everything, from trading game to RPG to FPS, and it fails miserably at ALL OF THEM! Coupled with a badly constructed game, it makes the whole package a MASSIVE FAIL. DO NOT BUY, under any circumstances, these filths don't deserve a single cent! It's like they tried to make EVERY single bad decision a game developer can while making a game, then after they finished, they released this ♥♥♥♥♥torm! DON'T BUY EVEN AT GUNPOINT!			"

												I had this game in my library far before reviews were a thing on Steam (even before they tracked hours, remember that?)-- I remembered the game as being entertaining and was shocked to see all of the negativity. So naturally, I had to go back.Space Trader is best described in four steps:1) Find a starship2) Get seriously deep with the wrong people3) ???4) Profit.It's not a global marketing simulator, it's a game where you Han Solo your way through a gunslinging, profiteering, not-quite legit smuggling career. The only thing that matters in this game is making enough profits to survive the stage. There's a lot of fun to be had doing the very simplistic FPS missions while trying to grab the most profitable deals while racing against the clock (though you'd wish that clock were either shorter to keep the pressure on or longer to stretch out the experience).This was one of the first Steam purchases I'd made and, despite leaving the game to gather etheral dust in cyberspace, I have a lot of fun memories playing it. You won't put 100+ hours on this game but, if you're the sort of person who enjoys the above, you'll get a kick out of the short time you do spend with it. 7/10			"

												This game was terrible and not worth the time. I picked it up as a part of the Meridian4 pack when it was on significant discount.The story basically isn't there. There are objectives given at the start with poor resolutions at the end of a chapter but no real development. There's intrigue with a corrupt trade police but it doesn't actually go anywhere. While the main character does change over time, he doesn't feel like he's in any better a position at the end than when he starts despite significantly different circumstances. The time constrains make pure trading unfeasible, so you're going to be doing a lot of FPS arenas to make your goals with the bountys. The only good thing I've seen about this game is in the later stages with Jupiters moons having variable travel time depending on their orbits. That was a nice touch.			"

												A Pleasant Suprise. That pretty much sums up my expeirence with this game. You play as a ""Space Trader"" which is really a bounty hunter with a keen eye for stocks.PresentationThis game is an ugly child. It says 2008 but it looks like early PS2. The sound design is okay nothing really outstanding or really terrible.StoryBare-bones at best. You get a ship, pay off your debt, get betrayed, etc. etc. The characters aren't really engaging or interesting and you probably won't remember their names. GameplayThis is where this ugly duckling turns into a regular looking duck. The goal of the game is simple, collect money to pay off your debt. There are three ways to do this: bounty hunt, trade, and do side missions. Bounty Hunting is a personal favorite of mine, you get transported to one of like 5 locations, kill some gaurds and collect the goods, and when your target arrives you kick his/her respective♥♥♥♥♥ While the repeating stages can get annoying it does help you remember where all the items are to get the most profit. Trading is simply selling items to the shops, the twist is the prices rise and fall like stocks which depending on your stash can mean a big payday or patiently waiting for the value to go up. The sidequests can either be more bounty hunting, finding people and talking, or collectng x amount of objects. these can pay very well and give you the occasional options like when these two thugs wanted to poison the water supply you could do it and make some serious bank from selling water, or report them. Really worth a look and a high point of this bundle. "

												This game was terrible and not worth the time. I picked it up as a part of the Meridian4 pack when it was on significant discount.The story basically isn't there. There are objectives given at the start with poor resolutions at the end of a chapter but no real development. There's intrigue with a corrupt trade police but it doesn't actually go anywhere. While the main character does change over time, he doesn't feel like he's in any better a position at the end than when he starts despite significantly different circumstances. The time constrains make pure trading unfeasible, so you're going to be doing a lot of FPS arenas to make your goals with the bountys. The only good thing I've seen about this game is in the later stages with Jupiters moons having variable travel time depending on their orbits. That was a nice touch.			"

												A Pleasant Suprise. That pretty much sums up my expeirence with this game. You play as a ""Space Trader"" which is really a bounty hunter with a keen eye for stocks.PresentationThis game is an ugly child. It says 2008 but it looks like early PS2. The sound design is okay nothing really outstanding or really terrible.StoryBare-bones at best. You get a ship, pay off your debt, get betrayed, etc. etc. The characters aren't really engaging or interesting and you probably won't remember their names. GameplayThis is where this ugly duckling turns into a regular looking duck. The goal of the game is simple, collect money to pay off your debt. There are three ways to do this: bounty hunt, trade, and do side missions. Bounty Hunting is a personal favorite of mine, you get transported to one of like 5 locations, kill some gaurds and collect the goods, and when your target arrives you kick his/her respective♥♥♥♥♥ While the repeating stages can get annoying it does help you remember where all the items are to get the most profit. Trading is simply selling items to the shops, the twist is the prices rise and fall like stocks which depending on your stash can mean a big payday or patiently waiting for the value to go up. The sidequests can either be more bounty hunting, finding people and talking, or collectng x amount of objects. these can pay very well and give you the occasional options like when these two thugs wanted to poison the water supply you could do it and make some serious bank from selling water, or report them. Really worth a look and a high point of this bundle. "

												Long, long ago on a computer far away an enterprising game designer created a free program about the drug trade, and they called it 'DopeWars.' A bit shorter time ago I had a palm III and I got a game with the same name as this one, but it was a more conservative port of DopeWars with a bit of ship management added in.Now we have this latest entry into the 'trader' game pile, and I have to say I'm not exactly thrilled after nearly two hours of gameplay on just the first mission. This isn't to say that I don't see the potential, and I did have fun with the setup, but I noticed a few things that might be deal-breakers for those looking to just bounce around buying and selling.Firstly, you seem to make more money doing the side-quest shooter arenas that are basically fights against bots, quake 3 style, complete with respawning weapons and pickups. For a game about trading this seems a bit off message, but easy enough to let it slide, since it does provide a break to the actual game and gives you extra funds and inventory for trade.I think of it as something extra from what's on the tin.Second, extra cargo spaces are treated as a commodity, which makes no sense to me. They even fluctuate in price between planets so you could feasably make profit selling the only part of your ship that you can upgrade. This plays into my even bigger point, which is this game could benefit greatly from just a bit more effort in the space travel side of things. You go through this big setup as to the why and how of getting your ship, and the necessity of paying off the debt, but you never see this ship, nor any other. There is talk of space-pirates, but I doubt you really go into any sort of combat with them, unless it's another one of those bot-arena matches mentioned before. Plus it would be a great expense along with the cargo bays, something to use your money for. This calls back to the Space Trader from my palm iii days....maybe I'm just nostalgic.Third, the first mission itself, and a particular side-mission forced on you by the same person, aren't clear on how to complete. I was given the task of amassing a debt-payment of considerable size, which was easy enough, and given a bot-match that I complete as well, but they remained in my 'news' tab till the mission failed, reloading just dumps me back to the start. This appears to be a bit broken, surely in this future space universe we're dropped into, especially one with banks, you'd be able to make installment payments to pay off your debt if the challenge were more long term.As it stands, since the challenge has a short time frame, again it would make sense that the first thing you would be told to do after hitting the amount you owe in profit would be reminded that you have to pay it off, or at least told how you would go about satisfying the end condition. Maybe I'm just tired and it was blatantly obvious, I did write this up after basically struggling with it for two hours, and I haven't really looked into any guides or other solutions, but a game that presents itself so simplistically in places like this one shouldn't need a guide to finish the 'baby's first' challenge.Cutting this short (yes short, I can keep going) I'm giving this game a tentative recommendation based upon its current price and availability in a sales package, since for this much you get what you can expect, a game where you trade between planets in space, with a bit of bot-shooting added in for flavor, but if you're just looking for a trader without the fluff and semi-broken, non-intuitive bits to slog through there are plenty of free alternatives.

												So this game literally won't let you reload anything.  If a mission goes wrong(the place where i stopped and uninstalled was where i had to transport to a guy to get a code, and assumed my character would automatically tell the other npc, whereupon i realized i had to actually remember it, it wouldn't let me transport back and it ruined the whole mission and I couldn't get to do it again.  This is either sloppy design or trying to prove some stupid point, but just not worth playing.  It's cheap for a reason.			"

												Space Merchant is a game with an identity crisis. It is mainly a buy/sell stock market type video game of the future. It tries to incorporate first person shooter action as well. If you're looking for a market based game where you trade commodities based on their profits, this is your game. There are interesting characters to trade with a quite a bit to do. The voice acting is simply a joke. One of the most annoying sounds I've ever heard in my life occurs when you walk up to civilians and they say ""later"" or whatever it is. Makes me cringe every time! The tutorial was quite lacking, although I understand there is a fine line between innundating/confusing players with too much detail and letting them actually play the game. It will take you a couple times through to understand the nuances of it. For the first person shooter crowd, this is a definite pass. The ""run and gun"" aspect of this is simply a joke. There are three guns, a starter pistol, a shotgun, and a machine gun. Not exactly a wide selection by any means. When you pick up a new gun, some times the game will automatically switch to it, others it will not. This can be quite frustrating as you can imagine. Another issue is respawning location. You have 3 chances to defeat the bounty. The game randomly drops you off in locations, some times right by a henchmen. After a respawn, you stand very little chance defeating a well equipped good, meaning another chance wasted. The game randomly stops you midstride, which sucks if you're running away from someone who is shooting in your direction. Lastly, perhaps the biggest disappointment of all, there are no upgrades of any sort. You'd expect to improve your skills the more bounties you attempted or completed, but that is not the case. Every time is almost the same, making it quite repetitive. I'm rating this game as barely passable because I do enjoy playing it, despite its many flaws (mostly on the bounty hunter side).  "

												I think I got this game for like $.50 or something in a bundle but it was well worth more then $5-$10 as I think it is priced on steam.Been really enjoying playing the first few challanges and working into the main story line. Trading is pretty straight forward, shop around till you find things that are cheap and buy them up and wait for the price to rise. Sell when you can make a profit.Building up and getting more places to travel is a lot of fun as each place brings new side quests as well as new people and places to see and visit. All in all I think this is well worth some gaming time and would recommend it for anyone who wants to find them selves battling, trading, and making a fat sum off the market fluctuation.... or going bankrupt in a few hours.Either way, this game is worth every penny!

I'd rather say ""Dont waste your time, let alone your money"" but then again as someone who loves space trading games and the idea of creating an inter-galactic transport empire, it appealed to me. I was just very very let down by this title.If you really want to be a space trader in a multiplayer dynamic virtual economy, I'd recommend EVE Online, Star Citizen or Elite Dangerous so you can properly go for it. If your just looking for single player you could always try something like Freelancer with a mod or 2.			"

Product received for free
												To be honest, I was expecting disappointment, especially because I got it free, but it is not too bad. Granted it isn't Game of the year... or even game of the month material, but it is not bad.The trading is pretty basic, the side-quests are alright, the main story line is kinda thought out, and the combat isn't TOO bad. You make money in a few ways. Finding around 50-100 items scattered around a trading port in the planets, all of which seem to have citizens that do not understand the concept of keeping their items, both legal and illegal, in their safety deposit boxes, or safes, or houses. You can also buy and sell items, go bounty hunting, or do some tasks for various people (including aquiring certain items or... you guessed it, killing people). The combat includes about 3-5 different maps (some of which are altered slightly in appearance) that, after a while get somewhat mundane. The trading in pretty simple, which is a plus for some, but also a minus for others who want to use certain strategies to be able to maximize their wealth beyond seeing what is in surplus or demand. The combat includes getting 3 chances to kill a certain number of enemies in order to have the boss arrive. You can go around and collect items that are left about, as well as get cash off the bodies of your slein enemies. One of the major flaws though is that after the boss is defeated, he drops a bunch of items, sometimes more than 20-30 boxes around him, that can be picked up. This wouldn't be so bad, in fact it would be terrific if it weren't for the fact that each set of 4 or so items leave a text on the screen that shows what they were for several seconds. That text has to dissappear before anything else can be picked up (even the money, which is sometimes in the 10s of thousands, and even more). If the money is in a stack of many items, it may take a while to get it. Which brings us to another problem, you only have 10 seconds to pick up all of your loot after the boss is killed. After that, you get nothing more. Kinda sucks. But anyways, I give it a 7.5/10, not too bad, but definitely has a large flaw or two in it. But oh well, I got it for free anyways.			"

												Do not buy this game it is absolutely terrible, it's incredibly dull and the trading system isn't even any good you can just bounce between the earth and moon continually buying and selling the same things for constant profit.The gunplay is also extremely basic and tedious during the few times you get to actually use your weapons.It's also done in a weird chapter/challenge system instead of making it one continous story or an openworld/sandbox system which seems pretty arbitary.Didn't try multiplayer but considering the rest of the game i doubt its any good.

												Honestly,for 50 cents..it's quite a steal. The game is kept simple but yet entertaining. Graphics are a bit dated and the enemy A.I is stupid but it's the storyline and game mechanics which help cover those up.It gets kind of repetitive in the first few levels where you basically have to go around and sell and trade. Rinse and repeat this till' you get enough money to pay off your ship. Not to mention the levels where you see combat are the exact same and do not change at all.Other than that,for 50 cents,it's a pretty good game. $2 or higher isn't worth it anymore. "

												I really looked forward to this when I purchased it.  I got frustrated after I failed for the second time on the first mission.  I did all the bartender jobs and every quest I could.  I searched high and low for the lady to pay her back and couldn't find her.  I did not find any quests to turn in.  The goal is 1.5m and I hit roughly 4m the second time.  I had 2m in cash and 2m in the bank, and it still failed the mission.  The game requires that you play part of it as a FPS.  Normally that doesn't bother me, but being that it is required, you would think they would put a little more time and effort into that part of the game.  The controls are fine but the guns are finnicky, the ai is terrible, and the combat seems like I'm battling with a rubber♥♥♥♥♥♥♥gun at times since the bullets seem to go wherever they please even when crouching.  I do not recommend this game.			"

												I had a lot of fun playing this game.  It has a simple core mechanic: buy goods at your current location, pick another location to travel to and sell your goods there then buy new ones - repeat.  It has a secondary mode as a FPS that can largely be ignored if you don't like it.  As a fan of merchant/empire games and FPS games this was great for me.  They even have a plot and side missions voiced by a hilariously small cast of actors obviously altering their voice to be different people.Would have liked it to be longer and would definitely buy a sequel.

												I genuinely don't understand all the negative reviews about this game.  The graphics are cutting edge for its time (even if the audio is cripplingly glitchy), the market mechanics are easy to understand and make sense, and the FPS element of the game is comparable to several others of its time, like Quake III: Arena - without the great multiplayer (which is the only thing about Quake III that actually *was* any good), and adding playing with commodity prices.   This game's multiplayer support was dismal, but as multiplayer was sort of an afterthought and not really what the game was about, I can forgive this.  I've played a lot of games where the single player campaign is good, and the multiplayer not so much.  Big deal.  Personally, I don't do a lot of multiplayer - meaning I don't live for it like other players, and my good review of a game doesn't depend on it having a good multiplayer mode, so it wasn't a major factor in my enjoyment of it.  When you design a game to be single player and add multiplayer support later in order to appease that crowd, it's always going to be lackluster at best.  Another thing others complained about was the price.  I got the game through Humble Bundle with a bunch of other titles for a very low price, so I don't really have a right to complain with the rest.  I'll be honest, by itself for 4.99 on Steam I probably would have never looked at it twice, but having got it in the bundle and trying it, I discovered that it's a decent game...though I honestly only kept playing it after I completed it in an attempt to get all the Steam achievements.  Difficulty isn't too severe - the market system is easy to figure out, and the FPS AI isn't particularly smart, though they do seem to have something approaching super-human aim (which is something that Quake III was also guilty of).  The challenges are actually fairly difficult to master, but the campaign is reasonably easy to defeat.  All this being said, I won't recommend the game - It's past its time.  I won't hate on it like others have - for its age, it's decent, but there's very little to attract my attention to it now.			"

												Long, long ago on a computer far away an enterprising game designer created a free program about the drug trade, and they called it 'DopeWars.' A bit shorter time ago I had a palm III and I got a game with the same name as this one, but it was a more conservative port of DopeWars with a bit of ship management added in.Now we have this latest entry into the 'trader' game pile, and I have to say I'm not exactly thrilled after nearly two hours of gameplay on just the first mission. This isn't to say that I don't see the potential, and I did have fun with the setup, but I noticed a few things that might be deal-breakers for those looking to just bounce around buying and selling.Firstly, you seem to make more money doing the side-quest shooter arenas that are basically fights against bots, quake 3 style, complete with respawning weapons and pickups. For a game about trading this seems a bit off message, but easy enough to let it slide, since it does provide a break to the actual game and gives you extra funds and inventory for trade.I think of it as something extra from what's on the tin.Second, extra cargo spaces are treated as a commodity, which makes no sense to me. They even fluctuate in price between planets so you could feasably make profit selling the only part of your ship that you can upgrade. This plays into my even bigger point, which is this game could benefit greatly from just a bit more effort in the space travel side of things. You go through this big setup as to the why and how of getting your ship, and the necessity of paying off the debt, but you never see this ship, nor any other. There is talk of space-pirates, but I doubt you really go into any sort of combat with them, unless it's another one of those bot-arena matches mentioned before. Plus it would be a great expense along with the cargo bays, something to use your money for. This calls back to the Space Trader from my palm iii days....maybe I'm just nostalgic.Third, the first mission itself, and a particular side-mission forced on you by the same person, aren't clear on how to complete. I was given the task of amassing a debt-payment of considerable size, which was easy enough, and given a bot-match that I complete as well, but they remained in my 'news' tab till the mission failed, reloading just dumps me back to the start. This appears to be a bit broken, surely in this future space universe we're dropped into, especially one with banks, you'd be able to make installment payments to pay off your debt if the challenge were more long term.As it stands, since the challenge has a short time frame, again it would make sense that the first thing you would be told to do after hitting the amount you owe in profit would be reminded that you have to pay it off, or at least told how you would go about satisfying the end condition. Maybe I'm just tired and it was blatantly obvious, I did write this up after basically struggling with it for two hours, and I haven't really looked into any guides or other solutions, but a game that presents itself so simplistically in places like this one shouldn't need a guide to finish the 'baby's first' challenge.Cutting this short (yes short, I can keep going) I'm giving this game a tentative recommendation based upon its current price and availability in a sales package, since for this much you get what you can expect, a game where you trade between planets in space, with a bit of bot-shooting added in for flavor, but if you're just looking for a trader without the fluff and semi-broken, non-intuitive bits to slog through there are plenty of free alternatives.

												I gave this game a chance. I really did. It came as part of a bundle of action indie games. While it was not one of the games I was really focused on in the pack, I though ""what the hell"" and installed it. I was looking forward to a simplistic versioin of Privateer. What I got was a buggy, low quality game that I can honestly say does not stand up to most free flash games.There are only two real activites. Trading, which is very simplistic and requires very little strategy beyond taking advantage of the news events they throw at you, and paper thin combat / bounty missions.Inbetween those, you are lost most of the time. The final chapter is especially riddled with problems since you have very little clue as to what to do and a very tight timeframe in which to do it.I have played through the whole of the game, but I cannot recommend it. Even it you only pay fifty cents for it. I can see that the developers had some great ideas, but their lack of quality execution just killed the project. "

												There was potential in this game, love the market and profit/devalue of items in different places. but here is the bad: Combatno easily visible health. the ammo counter is tiny. and the worst part: the muzzle flash/bullet effects blur your screen so bad that its hard to aim. just wow. we're firing shotguns and rifles at each other there's no reason i should see large blue clouds in my screen every other shot. no cover system either. the AI randomly spawns while you're in a gunfight, so expect fools to pop up behind you while you're behind a crate shooting some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ behind you lights you up without your knowing because the screen is a blue cluster♥♥♥♥ of neon lights. itd be easier to have a gunfight on LSD.but aside from the HORRENDOUS combat. not a bad game 6/10			"

												I can think of worse ways to blow $5. It's a fun little indie game that lets you tear up spacenomics, get involved in space dramas, shoot up space criminals, and pick up floating crates that are right next to people you can sell them to. In space.If this isn't why we play videogames, I don't know what is.			"

												I love this game.  If you love violent/monster games forget it.  Slow paced.  Who cares about graphics.  If you are a kid and calling people chicks and dudes this is the wrong game for you.  Some violence with no blood and easier than most shoot 'em up games.  Basically a laid back game with story lines based on trading plus one story line with several chapters.  Achievements but most are easy to get.			"

												The game has an interesting concept, merging a space trading game with some first person action elements and missions, and even a bit of mystery (Where the heck is Lieutenant Dan?), however it falls short on many levels.Firstly, as a trading game it is pretty weak.  The economy simulation has a very limited number of commodities and the pricing mechanics are reasonably predictable.  Go to destination A, buy the highest priced goods that have the most recent lowest price, possibly split the cargo hold between the two top picks, then travel to the next destination to hopefully (and almost always) sell it at a higher price then repeat.  It's fairly tedious, and there is no buy/sell commission/overhead so you just sell off your entire inventory whether it is a profit or loss, then buy up whatever is the best deal on the current planet even if it is one of the things you just sold them, fairly unrealistic compared to any other trading games I've played as there is no buy-ask spread whatsoever.  There are 5 missions in campaign mode and the first 4 are more or less like tutorials more than anything and have only 2 or 3 destinations which is pretty suboptimal for a space trading game really.  The real game is campaign mission 5 which has 4 destinations and a bit of a story to it (albeit a weak one).  The biggest mystery in the game is trying to find Lieutenant Dan, which is a bit challenging, but also rather disappointing when you do find him.You then go on contract hitman jobs to kill various bad guys you've been either sent to take out, or that you opted into by taking a job through the bartenders.  The contract hits are incredibly repetitive due to there only being about 3 or 4 small maps that they play out in.The FPS enemy AI is 1990s quality, and the action isn't that great.  The meat of the game is in mission 5 which is the longest and has the most trading destinations (4 total).  You're on a countdown timer from 500 hours with each travel you take consuming some number of hours with which you must meet the trading objectives.  Problem is, from the start you can't trade anywhere due to a military presence halting trading, so you have to travel around to make money from hit jobs to then pay off the authoritarian police state guys to leave so trading can resume.The rest of the time you end up running around the levels collecting crates full of random commodities like Super Mario and selling them.  It's very tedious and gets boring quick.I finished this game just to see if there was anything at all exciting about it, but it was somewhat disappointing.  If it is a space trading game you're looking for, this sure isn't it.			"

												Update: I was using the onboard graphics but once I added a Nvidia GTX 750 Ti card the game runs now without the stuttering and hitching.So it runs and is not a bad game for the cheap price.Really cannot recommend this game.Once ST starts, during the intro, the game begins to stutter, freezes for 2 or 3 seconds, and does this every 5 to 10 seconds.This makes the game unplayable.For .49 USD it maybe worth it to some people to see if you can get ST to work but .49 USD is probably better spent on something else.There are those who say it is because the game is older and will not run on modern computers to which I say, why?Other older games on Steam run fine on my Windows 8.1 computer why not this one.I suppose if you have an older machine with older hardware this maybe a game you can try.

												although i play this game and enjoy it beacause its vintage i dont recomend to buy itcons*small enviorments*save-load doesnt exist (only autosaving which is useless)*if you lose you must repeat the whole chapter*bounty missions take place only in 2 diffrent place's*Every chapter is timed and the timmer goes down with every travel (planet,bounty hunting,mission teleporting)*The whole game is buy sell... nothing more *around 2-3 options when you speaking whith a NPC *i plays on a small window and you cant play it in full screen (belive me its really tiring for your eyes)*graphics are bad for a game of 2008 it is more like game from 80s (goldfinger was far better than this and it was  a game that realished 1986...)*In every travel a stupid android pop up and say NOT GREAT AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHI dont recomend you to buy it,i think its really not worth the money even if its in 4 euros if you going to buy it dont waste more than half of its price			"

												Shouldn't have passed the development stage.Stay away, and this is why:An interesting idea which starts out very nice, but is let down by shoddy graphics, poor game mechanics and linear gameplay. I'd rather say ""Dont waste your time, let alone your money"" but then again as someone who loves space trading games and the idea of creating an inter-galactic transport empire, it appealed to me. I was just very very let down by this title.If you really want to be a space trader in a multiplayer dynamic virtual economy, I'd recommend EVE Online, Star Citizen or Elite Dangerous so you can properly go for it. If your just looking for single player you could always try something like Freelancer with a mod or 2.			"

												I personally enjoyed this game throughly.  Has ""in"" references to popular games, sucha as when one robot quotes the Slylandro Probes from Star Control 2.  There are lots of things to do and it is fairly easy to beat.  Sure, it is better suited to the casual gamer, but it is cheap and fun.			"

												Do not buy this game it is absolutely terrible, it's incredibly dull and the trading system isn't even any good you can just bounce between the earth and moon continually buying and selling the same things for constant profit.The gunplay is also extremely basic and tedious during the few times you get to actually use your weapons.It's also done in a weird chapter/challenge system instead of making it one continous story or an openworld/sandbox system which seems pretty arbitary.Didn't try multiplayer but considering the rest of the game i doubt its any good.

												It's cute, it's short, it's got some enjoyable old school combat, and the trade aspects are fun and simple (although it's too easy to make a ton of money). If you've got a couple of hours to kill then you can blaze through it pretty fast. (My hours on record are bugged, I'd say I spent about 10 hours unlocking everything.) This isn't a stellar title, but if you liked the games that came out in the Doom era then you'll enjoy this, and it's often bundled or on sale. It's easily worth a buck.			"

												This is a great little budget game you shouldn't underestimate.  If you enjoy dope wars type of games and don't mind some sometimes challenging FPS combat, this is the game for you.  There's definitely a lot of challenge here and considering the price, it's worth it. Just don't expect 2016 level graphics and what-not, but what the game does have works. A solid title!			"

												I spent 50 cents on this game. I got 5ish hours of play out of it. I didn't finish it, but dang, I pay 12$ to see a 2 hour movie. Simple economics tells me that it was a good purchase. See how I am seguing into this being about trading? You go shoot people, you go trade things, that's what this game is. It looks like a game that came out early 2000's, plays a bit like it, so if that is a turn off, then don't play.			"
