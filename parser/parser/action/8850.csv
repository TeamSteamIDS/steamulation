												Why people insist Bioshock Infinite is amazing and that Bioshock 2 is a mistake is a complete mystery to me. One of the few games to actually make me cry, Bioshock 2 is a masterpiece following a masterpiece, a feat few other franchises can claim. I beg anyone who bothers reading this review. Buy this game, it is worth every penny.			"

												Bioshock 2 is an interesting beast: when it first came out, it was largely panned as being a rehash of the first game, and not a ""proper"" sequel. Yet, in retrospect having played Infinite, Bioshock 2 seems to be the one which will age most gracefully, and it has aged nicely thus far.Bioshock 2 is a First-Person Shooter in the vein of the original Bioshock, where you take on the role of a Big Daddy in the underwater city of Rapture. Where the original Bioshock explores the themes of Libertarianism, Bioshock 2 deals with Communism, perhaps not quite as strongly. Combat has been vastly improved by allowing access to both plasmids and guns simultaneously (which was used in Bioshock Infinite), while still retaining the full allotment of interesting weaponry. Additionally, trap versions of basically every form of plasmid are available for use in a series of ""protect the Little Sister"" sequences spread throughout the game.Bioshock 2 also handles the moral choice system much more eloquently than the first game, with some actual balance to the choices that need to be made - arguably the most successfully that I've found in any game.Ultimately, the game absolutely is more Bioshock, and it perhaps took place a tad too close to the original which is why it had as hard a time it did at release. Additionally, there's multiplayer achievements, but I don't expect that there's any real multiplayer activity at this pont, so...buyer beware on that aspect.All in all, it's a great time. and I highly recommend it. Also, I'd recommend picking up Minerva's Den: It's an excellent DLC which distills the formula to its core and is an all around enjoyable experience.			"

												BioShock unquestionably changed the world of first person shooters by setting a new bar for storytelling in video games. With an epic story that pitted sanity versus insanity, gamers played Jack, a plane crash survivor who stumbled upon the underwater city of Rapture. Your goal was not just freedom but also to bring down billionaire industrialist Andrew Ryan whose utopia dissolved into a freakish world of hellish experiments gone wild.It was a surreal experience that pitted the gamer against an army of the strange, the wrong and totally chaotic. Unlike those first person shooters set on alien planets, the future or on the battle field, BioShock was set in 1958 which only enhanced the gameplay experience in this alternate reality through the creepy music and settings. Of course, the stylised graphics and music made this even more plausible. Add in elements from the survivor genre to top it off and BioShock successfully created a worldwide hit.And here we are again, 3 years later and the underwater city of Rapture still breathes but a huge twist has been thrown into the story, thanks to the gamer now playing a Big Daddy. For the uninitiated, Big Daddy's were the huge golem like creatures from the original game who protected the Little Sisters. However, unlike the other Big Daddy's from the previous title, your avatar has free will and let's just say that if anyone or anything gets in your way, the repercussions will be deadly.Before starting your BioShock 2 experience, the viewer is treated to a very interesting cinematic that introduces you to the world of this bizarre universe. Although it begins in 1958 and without spoiling the story too much, you are separated from your Little Sister and you awake ten years later. When you finally do get control of your character, it's all a mystery as to who or what you are. However, just like the original, the story slowly comes together, piece by piece. If you want to get even more in-depth, diaries are littered throughout the gaming environment to enhance the story.As you wake within the Adonis Luxury Resort of Rapture City, you learn that this area was also used for genetic enhancements and so your journey begins of discovery and retribution. One of the main themes in the game is that girls are being kidnapped from islands around Rapture city in order to become Little Sisters for these twisted experiments. For this unnamed Big Daddy, you eventually have contact with Eleanor Lamb, the Little Sister you were once linked with. Unfortunately for her, her mother Sofia Lamb refuses to abide by your wishes and was the person responsible for your vile imprisonment. Needless to say, there are plenty of your in-your-face moments to the story of BioShock.To compliment the story and those wow moments is the amazing level design, especially the underwater areas. The game itself is a first person shooter, however it has elements of RPG and the survival genre to stir things up. Unreal Technology powers the gaming interface as you tackle the denizens of Rapture City from those gone mad on ADAM, the slicers and your gender twisted sisters which all produce a memorable and decent gaming experience.In terms of completion, BioShock 2 takes around 14-15 hours, give or take and has three alternate endings available to the player. For replay value, as the gameplay is so sturdy and the storyline so compelling, most gamers can easily get another play out of the game and go down another path to get that different ending. We've only completed BioShock 2 as a ""good"" Big Daddy, so we're eager to check out some of the other paths available for our character. Speaking of Big Daddy! The control system of BioShock 2 has been well mapped and gamers of all different levels of experience will easily be able to control all facets of Big Daddy, even its deadly drill connected to its arm. If you have played the original, it does take a small amount of time getting use to this monstrous creature as opposed to a human but best of all, Big Daddy has access to some powerful heavy artillery such as Gatling guns and the like. When it comes to combat, the player has options of melee, weapons or genetic powers. With that said, the game is quite violent at times, especially when you're using your drill to disembowel your enemies. Big Daddy's were quite powerful in the original game and to make things fair to your enemies, they have received a slight power make-over. As you fight Splicer's or Big Sisters, it's great how they use the environment to their advantage such as cover and even health stations to replenish their health. Depending on your difficulty setting, the AI can be quite vicious towards the player and does make the game that extra bit more challenging. I played on a medium setting and did get my butt handed to me on more than one occasion but that's where upgrades, new weapons and new powers come into play.When battling enemies, it's quite surreal seeing the enemies fight as they do mimic real-world players quite well. But sometimes you need to fight fire with fire and our favourite Big Daddy has a few of his own powers such as Telekinesis 3 which allows for almost Star Wars based powers as you throw items and even smaller critters around the screen. BioShock 2 supports dual weapons which is generally unleashed when your fighting one of the myriad of bosses but what I like about BioShock 2 is using the environment to your advantage such as flammable pipes, BOOM, or unleashing deadly electrical EVE into the water to dispose your enemies.In relation to bosses, they are quite powerful and if you do manage to die which you will, you will reappear in a rejuvenation chamber to fight again. My favourite battles in BioShock 2 are definitely the Big Sisters that pierce the sound barrier upon their arrival who have the force of a Big Daddy but unfortunately for you, the abilities of the Spider Slicers ""speed"" which will be frustratingly challenging at times but well worth the victory. Of course, not all BioShock is about fighting and you need to hack doors for entry, vending machines for supplies and even bots to fight at your side. ADAM is used to upgrade your powers and abilities and the player uses Little Sisters to harvest this powerful genetic material. Of course to get a Little Sister, the player must first dispatch the Big Daddy that is protecting them. Once a Little Sister is yours, you can them use them to draw ADAM from corpses. This brings another strategy into the game through the use turrets and traps because once the Little Sisters start to harvest, other enemies are alerted, so you need to defend them quite well. As EVE played a huge role in the previous game which allowed you to use your powers, this also needs to be collected and replenished in BioShock 2. Fortunately, there are plenty of EVE hypos littered through the environments and some foods that can replenish it.When it comes to graphics, BioShock 2 is oozing with eye candy and looks amazing on high definition. The level design is brilliant that is complimented with some great lighting and special effects, especially the water. The characters are well animated and contain some great texture details, making it easy to be absorbed into the story of this ""nameless"" Big Daddy. The soundtrack is fitting and has a retro 1940's feel to it as is the voice acting, especially from our villain who is as mad as a hatter.From the very first moments, BioShock 2 holds an iron grip over you throughout the entire experience as you're given a violent tour of the legacy of Andrew Ryan's Rapture and the repercussions of his troubled dream. Some may say, it's the same as the previous game but I digress, it's a whole new chapter to this amazing underwater universe and if you don't believe me - buy it and you'll find out.			"

												What was wrong with System Shock 2?What was wrong with Thief 2?What was wrong with Fallout 2?What was wrong with... Bioshock 2?Exactly. I'm not sure why many didn't even give Bioshock 2 a chance. It's great to be back in Rapture and the gameplay is improved upon in every single way. Dual wielding plasmids/guns is fun, the new enemy types are great, the Little Sister mechanics are awesome, the level design is fantastic, and the story is solid enough. Tack on Minerva's Den and it's just icing on the cake. If you were a fan of the original and skipped out on this one, all you've done is a disservice to yourself. It's a great game, so would you kindly give it a chance?			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Bioshock 2 Original Release: 2010 Genre Tags: FPS; Atmospheric; Action; Story Rich My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 8-20 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Auxiliary Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Fans of the intellectual property; Aesthetes; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseursREVIEWBioshock 2 returns the player to the vividly atmospheric world of Rapture and reintroduces all of the positive qualities that were prevalent in the first installment of this franchise. It is very, very similar to the first; so expect it to play like a refined continuation rather than an entirely new game. But it does offer a more intimate perspective on the underwater dystopia, as the player will take on the role of a unique Big Daddy this time around and will be much more connected to the city. Most of the features are extremely similar to their counterparts in the original game; however there was definitely fine-tuning applied to some aspects. Perhaps most prominently, the combat and overall gameplay is significantly more exciting this time around. Overall, it is a great game that was mostly successful in living up to the high standard set by the first game.Now, it is essentially a direct sequel. Having played both games, I would suggest that you attempt to play the first one before this, if you can afford the time and money. Although, it isn’t entirely necessary and you could opt to read a synopsis rather than play through the entire first game. But I would suggest you at least do that to get a little background information. Doing so will provide you the opportunity to fully enjoy the subtle nuances throughout the game.As for the specifics, Bioshock 2 is a fundamentally well-crafted game for all the same reasons the original was. At the forefront, there is once again an exceptionally intriguing atmosphere and a wondrous gameworld design. The city of Rapture continues to fascinate. Throughout your adventure, you will probably notice that all of the subtle niceties and ancillary details add up to create a very immersive and pleasurable experience. I personally feel the ambiance of the gameworld is best quality of this game and holds true to the brand.The multidirectional storytelling that was expertly executed in the first game also returns in this sequel. The main storyline will unfold as you progress through the campaign, but you also can learn a great deal about the backstory and lore if you explore and if you seek out the collectibles. A lot is left up to the player to determine how much he/she wants to learn about the lore. The narrative elements are mostly well written and enticing; and the foundation of it all is the superbly idiosyncratic NPCs. It all comes together quite nicely. All of that said, the narrative elements as a whole may feel a little less interesting in Bioshock 2 than they were in the first— perhaps due to the unavoidable loss of novelty of core concepts that is intrinsic to all sequels.As for the actual gameplay, it is significantly more exciting in Bioshock 2 than in the original.  There were nice refinements to the combat system, and the fact you now can maul people with the patented Big Daddy Drill is an added bonus. But also the actual fight sequences are better designed, and the layout of the combat zones provides more opportunities for creativity and hazard-kills. And new gameplay systems like the harvesting of ADAM from dead splicers really brings the high-action combat element of the game to the forefront of the overall experience much more than in the first installment.There is also a multiplayer mode and although it has the potential to be quite fun, it suffers from a low population and not-so-friendly community of regulars. If you have the patience to deal with the wait times and inevitable toxic matches, you will occasionally find yourself in some games that can be pretty enjoyable. But I wouldn’t count on the multiplayer adding too much value to the game; the focus is definitely on the campaign.In summary, I would say that Bioshock 2 is a very good game, although perhaps not quite as masterful as the original. It is strongly tied to its predecessor, and so it would probably be best to play both if you want to get the full experience. But either way, most established FPS/RPG gamers should be fully able to enjoy this game, especially fans of strong narratives and intriguing atmospheres.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												You can't say anything about BioShock 2 without comparing it to the first one. BioShock 2 was an improvement in gameplay, that's for sure. Plasmid in one hand, gun in the other made a fine combination and killing was finally... well, fun.

Gene Tonics added another layer of depth, even though at the end you can easily buy all the slots and fill them with the best tonics. Also, you get to be a Big Daddy, finally. After playing the first one, almost every player had this thought, how nice would be to play as one. So you get a drill and a rivet gun. Didn't change much in gameplay, but is neat.Visuals:-great visuals-really detailed world-some great character design-gives a really creepy feeling to the entire game

												2K did a really good job of supporting this game after it was announced that GFWL was being shut down. Most of the DLC is now included in the base game and the remaining piece of DLC is now available on Steam, and was given to every current owner for free. They also added full controller support.

												Bioshock 2 was set up almost from the onset to be a colossal failure. It was to follow one of the most critically acclaimed games of all time, by a different developer, with the inclusion of a seemingly tacked on multiplayer mode to a series that had absolutely no need for one. It had every possibility to be a disaster, which makes it almost shocking that it arrived in a state that was not only comparable to the original game, but improved and expanded on it as well in ways that would be hard to go back from. It’s the sequel I never expected; maybe nobody did.And important distinction to make before discussing Bioshock 2’s narrative, is that the first game was first and foremost the story of the city of Rapture and its fall into madness through its own attempts to create a lawless utopia. In comparison, 2 is almost entirely focused around a very small cast of key characters; their relationships to each other, conflicting ideals, and eventual goals which clash with each other and create this very personal, self contained narrative, within which Rapture is merely a setting instead of the star.In some ways this is a good thing. By taking the focus off of Rapture and onto a new, very small collection of characters, developer 2K Marin is able to craft a more personal narrative, spending more time developing the characters that matter and the relationships between them. In other ways, it makes the time not spent directly advancing the plot far less impactful and memorable than they may otherwise have been. Characters outside the very core plot are introduced and then discarded in ways that feel contrived and unmemorable, moving you along but never leaving much of an impact outside of your immediate encounters with them. This also contributes to Rapture being a much less interesting, tangible place to explore, feeling stale and lifeless when at one point it was remarkably well crafted and intriguing.On the whole, the narrative is rather significantly less mentally stimulating, disregard the deeper themes of ideology, morality, and freedom that gave the original such an astounding sense of scope and inspired so much discussion about the different ideas laced within the game. Bioshock 2 tries to mimic what Irrational Games did so deftly, but it comes out as something superfluously intelligent; tossing about grand ideas in the background of a fairly simple plot that never attempts more than it can feasibly accomplish. Simplicity isn’t a bad thing by nature, as the story is still engaging and arguably easier to follow, but I rather missed the more sophisticated philosophical questions posed by the original that was so substantially more contemplative and inspired.  The change to a strictly linear world design was also rather disappointing to me, as though there are logical narrative reasons you wouldn’t be able to return to locations after you went through them, it’s yet another thing taken away from the original that causes Rapture to feel like a rather hollow environment. It’s still full of the same distinctive artwork, excellent sense of place, and fitting music, but it feels so soulless compared to what it once was that it makes returning to Rapture again almost dull at times. There are things later on which actually add interesting, fundamental aspects to the city’s lore, but by that point it’s almost too late and the moment will likely be lost or overlooked by most.Whether the changes are improvements or make up for what was lost is debatable, though by and large the plot failed to leave the impression the original did, despite being well written and interesting in its own right. Perhaps its the issue of being in the shadow of such a monumental achievement that was Bioshock, that anything to come after that isn’t as incredibly feels significantly more of a disappointment that it otherwise would. Had 2 been released as in a vacuum I may have been more receptive to what it was attempting to do, but with the weight of its predecessor on its shoulders there was just - something - missing to draw me in quite the same way as I was to the original.Where 2 far surpasses the original though is through the numerous refinements and additions it makes to the mechanics, turning Bioshock from a brilliantly deep and satisfying shooter, into a smoother, even deeper shooter that streamlines and polishes off the few rough edges of the original. The core of the combat is largely unchanged, utilizing a mixture of firearms and plasmids (essentially superpowers) to take down a variety of different splicers (the enemies of the game), but the introduction of dual wielding, the ability to instantly switch ammo types, a collection of interesting new weapons, a significantly faster and less cumbersome hacking system,  and a scaled back but even more customizable tonic (passive upgrades) system do a lot to make Bioshock 2 a much faster and enjoyable experience.They’re small changes for the most part to be sure, but collectively add up to a much tighter shooting experience that makes it hard for me to imagine returning to the comparatively clunky original. Encounters with the most prominent new enemy, Big Sisters, is another brilliant twist on something the original began (in this instance the Big Daddy fights, which also return), as quicker, more capable and powerful enemies that present a large challenge and require you change your tactics as they are far more versatile and aggressive than their older counterparts.These improvements make Bioshock 2 one of the most enjoyable and dynamic shooters I’ve ever played. Where it falters in its storytelling and world building, it makes up for with the sheer entertainment to be found in its combat, which only grows as the game goes on. It might not wholly surpass the original, but it surely approaches it in a lot of ways, which is something I scarcely imagined there was any possibility it could. In some ways it feels more akin to an update than an entire new experience, but when that update is so fun and smartly designed I can't complain.On multiplayer…Surprising though it may be, 2K has fitted a multiplayer mode within Bioshock 2, and even more unexpectedly it’s not terrible! More than that, it’s actually a rather enjoyable mode that while totally derivative of every other first-person multiplayer shooter in terms of modes, progression, and character customization, it transposes the campaigns fantastic shooting into a multiplayer mode almost entirely intact. Your weapons and abilities might be slightly neutered, but the combat is so strong at its core that I found myself spending a surprising amount of time with the mode and enjoying every moment of it. Bioshock as a shooter is almost completely unreplicated in any other game, so having that in a multiplayer mode that even in every other aspect is fairly uninteresting is rather compelling, and most certainly worth checking out despite its dubious inclusion.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												James Cameron's Aliens (1986) isn't as handsome or terrifying as Ridley Scott's Alien (1979), it doesn't have the same dreary beauty or pioneering tone (and the new aliens look cheap by comparison), but Aliens is a hell of a lot more fun to watch. It's also more moving, and maybe the better movie. Bioshock 2 is the same, and I think better than Bioshock 1 in almost every way that matters. Bioshock introduced the world and set the tone magnificently, but it was only half of a good game. Bioshock 2 gets the combat and enemies right, locations are more dynamic and the plot actually has stakes. It felt like I was fighting for something meaningful by the end, and I felt like more than just a guy with a gun/drill. And the Little Sisters are stunning characters. They're terrifying and memorable every time, and even when they're not around you're dreading the your next encounter, preparing, remembering escape plans, stocking up on ammo and health. After surviving all the mad things in Rapture, you'll inevitably face a Little Sister. You get to choose when and where you'll fight, and this mix of fear, adrenaline and tactics is really special for an FPS. Yeah, the graphics took noticeable a downgrade and nothing here matches the opening minutes of Bioshock 1, but everything else is an improvement and it's a shame more people don't know that.			"

												[Review only Russian]Игра пройдена. Причем с обоими концовками. Чтож, подводный город по прежнему жив. Нам, как и нашему новому главному герою (объекту Дельта), предстоит побывать в тех уголках города, которых мы не видели в первой части. В комплекте так же будут новые противники, новые плазмиды и прочее. В общем, весьма интересное продолжение которое заслуживаем внимания.Теперь о плюсах:- ГрафикаПо сравнению с первым BioShock-ом, выглядит даже чуть лучше- Сюжет Присутствует. Так же в комплекте 2 концовки. Т.е. есть альтернатива где игрок в праве выбирать какая концовка будет и/или ему ближе- Звук/музыкаОтлично дополняет атмосферу игры и способствует более глубокому погружению- УправлениеУниверсальное и обладает удобством игры, как с помощью традиционного метода (клавиатура + мышь), так и с помощью диванного манипулятора :) (геймпад Xbox 360).Ну а теперь... о минусах:- ЛинейностьИдем только вперед и... вперед. Шаг вправо и/или влево, если это конечно не касается сюжета, сделать нельзя. Просто не предусмотрено.[update 09/06/2014]Иногда, после автосохранения в начале уровня, может без причины выбросить на рабочий стол. Неприятное явление, но, пережить можно. Поэтому... просто почаще сохраняйтесь... и получайте удовольствие от игры. Unterhaltsames Spiel =)			"

												The most fun gameplay wise of the bios but the antagonist is so horribly lame that... well it works on that level I suppose... cringe worthy whenever she spouts her lame bullcrap but entretaining on some level at least.Fighting the big sisters is good fun. Overall, underrated to be sure. Sure Bio1 didn't really need this sequel but it's a good game in it's own right with a nice ending I though so... just play it and don't expect it to be BIO1 when it comes to the story and characters and you'll probably like it just fine overall.

 Bioshock 2 Review + How To Fix the Game Crashing  Without any spoilers Game Grade: A-Shorthand Review: Battle against hordes of murderous splicers in the decaying, or more accurately, the decayed city of rapture.  Bioshock 2 will force you to choose between your survival or your morals.Detailed Review:Personally, Bioshock is my favorite series.  You can ask any one of my friends and they will reluctantly agree.  If you have not played the first Bioshock, then I highly recommend that you play it first.  They must be played in order to understand everything.  Bioshock 2 has just about everything the first one had, but I do not want to compare them too much.  There are different endings you can achieve depending on how you play the campaign.  Also, the storyline (which will not be spoiled) is the 'at the end of your seat' game play we all enjoy.  The map tends to be large which gives you countless options on new places to explore.  Bioshock 2 is a wonderfully gripping sequal.The first detail I would like to talk about is the replay value.  If you have read some of my other reviews, then you would know I talk about this a lot.  Replay value, to me, really makes a game worth your money.  As you may know, Bioshock is known to have different endings which rely on choices you make in the game.  There are multiple decisions you need to make throughout the game.  Some of those decisions are more difficult than the others.  To really get your money's worth out of this game, you should play to get every ending.  This will require many hours of game play, but each time you play it will seem like a brand new game.  There is also another game mode you can play called the 'Protector Trials'.  I am going to put this the best way I can.  Its hard.Another point I would like to make on Bioshock 2 is the storyline.  Bioshock 2 is considered a ""weak"" sequel to many people.  Although it is not as good as the first, it was a necessary sequal to the series.  Bioshock 2 focuses on the desperate power grab for the keys to Rapture.  I don't really want to spoil anything so I will leave it at that.Finally, I would like to address the map.  You can expect as much exploration in Bioshock 2 as the first Bioshock (a lot).  There are many secondary objectives and secret rooms just waiting to be found.  You can almost here their faint sceams.. ""Find me.  Please... find me.""  This is another reason why I think it has great replay value.  By exploring the map to the fullest, you will be greatly rewarded in more ways than one.  One thing that you should not expect to change in this game is potential exploration.  The map is a maze and you are the mouse.Overall, the game is enjoyable with countless hours of possible game play.  Although it may not be as good as the first, it is still a clear Bioshock game.  There is still a 'horror' factor involved with the murderous splicers (as in the first game).  This game is definitely worth the time and money as long as you pay attention and find the cules.  I hope this review helped anyone thinking about buying this game.  If this did not help, then let me know by posting a comment.I made the overall review a bit short to help people out with the common problem of crashing.  To “fix” the game crashing and you losing your progress, save the game every couple of minutes.  The beginning is the main place the game will crash.  Once you get about 15 minutes into the game, the crashing should not be a problem.  If you need more help on how to fix it, then post a comment and I will do my best to help you out.			"

												Bioshock 2 is viewed as the black sheep of the ""Shock"" franchise, created as a cheap cash-in sequel by a different development team that crafted the first Bioshock.  But beyond the initial impressions from fans and critics lies a very competent game, that in some spots actually outshines the original.Good Stuff:-The story is just as good, if not better, than the original.  Most people disliked the story because it didn't add much depth to the mythos of Rapture, but the story in Bioshock 2 is much more personal and is more about the citizens of Rapture than the city itself.-The gameplay is vastly improved.  Plasmids and Guns are duel wielded, making combining them in combat much easier.  -Mechanics are streamlined, not simplified.  Gene tonics no longer have a type and can just be equipped, assuming you have the slots.  Hacking is now done in real time on a simplified  mini-game.  Even the research mechanic is reworked to use a video-camera that gives you more research points depending on how well you combo your plasmids/weapons.  There are also new weapons and plasmids that are fun to use and don't feel gimmicky.-The art design is top notch.  The level designers have fun showing what rapture would look like with 10 more years of rust and decay.-More moral decisions beyond ""Save/Kill Little Sister"".  The game also uses your decisions to inform the last act of the game and the ending.-Final ""boss"" fight is much better than the one in the first game.Bad Stuff:-The first hour of the game stinks. Period.  After you get into the first real level, the game begins to open up and let you start having fun.-Some of the new characters have to be hand waved into existence, especially since they were supposed to be around before the first game but are clearly never mentioned in the first game.-Levels are much more linear and not as large as in the first game. There are few sidepaths, but mostly you'll be running from point A to B without backtracking.-There are a few new enemies but I would have liked more enemy variety.-You can use little sisters to gather Adam, but you have to protect them as they do it.  Most people hated the escort mission from the first game, so it's something to be aware of.   I personally enjoyed this part of the game due to the multitude of alternate amunition that makes setting up traps fun.-It's clear that there were some significant rewrites late in development, some characters introduced at the start of the game are simply left out of the rest of the game's plot.Ugly Stuff:-The FoV is very low and requires ini-rebinding to reset it every time you launch the game.  The problem is going into ironsights also resets the FoV, making you have to press your bound key to reset your FoV every time.-Occasional issues with audio cutting out if there were too many sounds are playing at once. Verdict:Ignore people saying the game is a cheap cash in: the gameplay is better and arguably so is the story.  Although there are fewer levels than in the original, the game actually took me more hours to beat than the first game: around 14 hours.  It’s also interesting that a lot of the story beats and themes end up being used in Bioshock Infinite (although I’m sure Ken Levine hates to admit it).Minerva's Den is also an excellent add-on to the base game, and lasts around 3 hours.  I'd recommend playing through Bioshock 2 on hard mode if you've played many shooters before, the difficulty curve stays pretty good throughout the entire base game.  Minerva's Den is a bit harder on the same difficulty however, so keep that in mind.			"

												BioShock 2 is on the same level as the first game, but that is all.  Rather than improve upon the original game, it merely continues what it accomplished.  The story is fitting and complements the first well, but overall it feels more like an expanded campaign than an entirely different game.			"

												BioShock 2 is good.  Not exactly a surprise given the content of other available reviews on Steam, but why is it good seems the more important thing, something I'll try to address here.  I'm going to tell you why I think BioShock 2 is a worthy successor in the series.First things first, to get right down to brass tacks BioShock 2 is a sequel, it is mostly more of the same gameplay (with a few twists) and the few innovations don't exactly break the bank in the inventiveness department.  A few new weapons and interesting plasmid variations and a small smattering of new enemy types don't do much to dispel the notion that the combat is totally more BiShock.  But that's not what makes a BioShock game, not really.  Sure, the combat has to be engaging enough to drive the narrative forward, but in this game it does that just enough.  No, much like the first, the true draw is the dark and twisted story, the narrative tapestry that shows the dark and twisted nature of those living in Rapture.This game has you playing as a Big Daddy, the stalwart if myopic defenders of the Little Sisters.  In particular, you play a “prototype”, a nameless everyman changed into a monster but also a kind of father, and it is the theme of fatherhood that, like the first game, shares the roost with a political ideology to form the basis of the disastrous tale of the fall of Rapture.  Where the first game gazed on what genetics truly determine, on the pure unbridled force of Libertarianism and Capitalism, this game focuses on what it means to be a parent, and the equal sociopolitical dangers of a Communistic ideal that crosses the line into religious fervor.  It is the other side of the coin to Andrew Ryan's Rapture ideal of the individual's power in Rapture, the ideal of not just the social as one entity in a metaphorical manner, but what might happen if science could allow us all to actually become one.  And just as in the first game, the dangers of extremist politics show how such ideas can rip a society, and in particular a family apart.This is the crux of the story: as the first game contained two father figures for the original protagonist, the Big Daddy is one of two parent figures presented in the game. Unlike before where you were being acted upon as a child with two parental figures, now you are one of the agents of change, and your actions effect the story in a more noticeable (if still superficial) manner.It also drips the kind of scary, jarring atmosphere that is at once engaging to behold and terrifying to think about, the constructive and destructive nature of humankind.  Water drips, walls crack, but unlike before the underwater world outside Rapture is at least nominally explored, and it is beautiful, but sadly littered with the detritus of the once grand city.  The decay of the amazing city of Rapture is at once enthralling and disturbing, an emotional range that was demonstrated in BioShock, and is absolutely in full effect here.To add to the positives Minerva's Den, a small DLC adventure contained within this game, is a wonderful look at how every last person in Rapture was hurt, changed, damaged by the vision of Andrew Ryan.  Rapture is a crucible and all it seems to produce is tragedy, and each game with it as it's setting allows us to see something of ourselves in it's tragedy.  With arresting visuals, a story just as dark as it's sibling, and the upgraded combat engine, this game is well worth the time.  It is the other side of the coin, the “2” in this case being a quite literal extension of the first, and that is a very good thing indeed.			"

 This game is like a very, very good book, except it's better.  Such a great story.19/20 , cause perfection doesn't exist, but I almost can't think of any negative points on this game.Better than Bioshock 1 and Bioshock infinite in my opinion.			"

												More fun in Rapture, but not without its frustrations. The political background is a little less clear (in my opinion), but the main storyline still compelling and tragic.In terms of gameplay, elements like Gathering (especially the Protector Trials DLC) encourage you make use of traps and plasmids that you could largely ignore in Bioshock 1. On the other hand, this forced flexibility means you can't always rely on your favourite loadout for the most difficult set pieces in the game.Multiplayer is an exercise in futility. Assuming you're lucky enough to even find a game with enough players, a single griefer can wreck your whole experience. If you're trying to get all the achievements, take my advice and just play enough public games to have finished on every map (and won the DLC ones) and save a Little Sister, and then boost yourself to Level 50 on a private ADAM Grab map.Since the migration to Steam, game crashing is a real problem. There are things you can do to mitigate it (like upgrading your hardware), but save early, save often, save anyway. And if you do crash, go back TWO saves as there's a good chance the last one was corrupted. Then save again.			"

												Story set in a city build on the bottom of Pacific ocean named Rapture. It's year 1968 and for last 10 years Rapture has been devastated by Sofia Lamb and her followers, who believe in creating first Utopian - Eleanor - by imbuing her combined genius of Rapture's citizens through human sacrifice. Eleanor wants only to escape with her father - Subject delta who was now revived by her after Sofia shot him in 1958. Eleanor now lives like a slave under Lamb. You have to save her from this destiny. I really enjoyed playing this shooter game even though I haven't played the first one. I look forward to play next sequel Infinite. In game there are many interesting features, like collecting audio logs which reveals what had happened before you were revived by Eleanor, improving weapons, traps and other. If you like FPS and storybased games Bioshock 2 is one you can't miss.  8/10 "

												Bioshock 2 is possibly one of my all-time favourite games and for good reason. It was this genre defining title that carved up modern FPS adventure games, adding a dash of horror and giving the player to opportunity to play for other team. Exploring the same city you first escaped from seemed at first like a bore, but a whole host of new abilities, weapons and incentives gave the game an edge along with some great spooks keeping the story fresh, enjoyable and engaging. Re-living the game and re-living rapture is a delight, for anyone who hasn’t been blessed with the Bioshock title, I dearly advise you to seek out the triple pack available on steam. You can get this on sale for $20.00 or so, and believe me it is worth playing both 1 & 2 before the third, Infinite. Honestly, great games with real content and staying power, everyone should play or own them at least once.			"

												Bioshock 2 is a FPS developed and published by 2K Games and is the sequel and successor of Bioshock. Most people think the first game is better than the sequel , but i disagree. In my opinion the sequel improves on everything from the first game alongside adding more interesting and developed characters and story.The Story (Spoiler Free)Bioshock 2 takes place after the events of the first game although the OPENING of the game is set 2 years prior the events of the first one.BioShock 2 opens on New Year's Eve 1958 (two years before the events of the first game), as Subject Delta patrols Rapture with his Little Sister, Eleanor. Eleanor is separated from Delta by her mother, Sofia Lamb, who uses a mind control plasmid on Delta to make him shoot himself. Ten years later, Delta awakens, revived by Little Sisters under the control of Eleanor. Delta is drawn towards Eleanor by their past Big Daddy-Little Sister connection. Brigid Tenenbaum encounters Delta, and explains that unless Delta reunites with Eleanor, he will fall into a coma. With the help of the Little Sisters under Eleanor's control and Tenenbaum's ally, Augustus Sinclair, Delta makes his way towards Lamb's stronghold.GameplayThe game is a FPS with RPG elements to it which includes both singleplayer and multiplayer modes although multiplayer is    totally dead nowadays so i'll skip talking about it. The game has a total of 6 weapons , each with significant weapon upgrades. Unlike the first one , the sequel doesn't allow you to upgrade every weapon to the max although once you pick and upgrade your favourite weapon , you won't really need anything the others. The game also comes with 2 tools: Hack Tool and Research Camera , who both help you greatly on your journey. Unlike the first game , the resources in this one are plenty , so you'll have a chance to buy almost every upgrade and plasmid out there. There are a total of 11 plasmids in this game which most can be upgraded to level 3. Unlike the first game , in order to upgrade a plasmid to level 3 here , you first need to have bought the level 2 version of that certain plasmid , but don't worry , the currency you buy the plasmids with is plentyful depending on if you know what you're doing. The game has several endings depending on if you decide to save or gather the little sisters/spare or kill the people you meet along the way. GraphicsFor a game that was released in 2010 the graphics are pretty good. They sure do bring that creepy and abandoned atmosphere the game offers alive.SoundtrackOne of my favourite soundtracks in a game , the musicians definitely gave their best when they were making it. Here's one of my favourite tracks of the game:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2d8TVBameoComplaintsMy only complaints are that the game tends to crash at random when you save , so save as often as possible , i warned ya! ^^ There's also a chance that if it crashes right when you save , it may corrupt your save file in which case you gotta find the corrupted save file and delete otherwise the game is unplayable. Only happened to me twice through my playthrough but i tend to ignore it.Overall:The game took me around 30 hours to 100% all of it's singleplayer achievements and all of them were very enjoyable. This is one of my all-time favourite FPS games , i totally recommend you to buy it! If you haven't played it yet YOU ARE COMMITTING A SIN!I rate a total of 10/10 and mind you , i actually mean it unlike all those kids out there claiming ""10/10"" on so many things they aren't even sure they likehttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=712033396Now would you kindly buy this game and give my review a like? :)			"

												""Daddy! You always save me from the monsters.""Bioshock 2 is the right choice for you if you like the first Bioshock.. If you wish it would never end.. If you really want to continue.. The gameplay doesn't change that much. Hacking system is now much faster but also harder because the game doesn't stop while you are hacking as it was before. But! In Bioshock 2 you don't have to switch between weapons and plasmids. You can have equipped both at the same time, which is probably the best gameplay change they made. Get used to the slow movement because you can't sprint anymore. Maybe it will make you feel little bit better if I tell you that you will be compensated somehow.. You will be able to walk on the bottom of the sea! ;)Atmosphere is great, filled with scary moments. Music makes them even scarier. It increases the tension. It makes you lookout for what is coming. It makes you so stressed that every single after death movement of a body will make your heart beat faster!Dealing with little sisters can take much longer here, especially if you are interested in more ADAM. You can use every little sister for gathering more ADAM for you before you save(harvest) her. She will show you the way to the right body. You must protect her as she gathers. ADAM guaranteed. Meeting with big sisters also guaranteed. But that won't be that pleasant.. They scream too much for my taste.. ;)The story is great. It might get a bit emotional so prepare your handkerchiefs towards the ending. ;)			"

												That is one of the game series that when I hear a new Bioshock game is coming out, I get so excited.All of the defaults of the 1st Bioshock got fixed, the enjoyment is at maximum level.Bioshock 2 is the direct following of the first but you don't need to play it to understand the story.You are Subject Delta, one of the first prototype of a Big Daddy protecting a Little Sister: Eleanor Lamb, the daughter of the new leader of the Ryan Industries: Sofia Lamb. However, this woman wants her daughter back, she sends a Mind Control Plasmid over the Subject Delta and pushes him to shoot his head. The story begins 10 years after, the Subject Delta revives by getting in a Vita-Chamber helped by a Little Sister and during the whole adventure you will find that you have a powerful connection with Eleanor Lamb.When the 1st Bioshock was a little boring because you only had to save Little Sisters, here you have plenty things to do.- A great multiplayer mode with maps of Bioshock 1 & 2 and new plasmids, but the old Windows Live server closed and it's now working by peer2peer so it's lagging pretty much with some people but still playable.- The Big Sister, the new monster of the game, appears only when you save all the Little Sisters. She is really powerful and has the only plasmids you don't have.- It's now possible to upgrade the weapons and use techniques of combat.- The DLC Minerva's Den shows the end of Rapture.Afterall, this is the most complete Bioshock ever made even though Bioshock Infinite is also good but, it all started here.Everyone of you should have played this game, atleast once.

												Back to Rapture in this amazing sequel, this time around... you ARE ""Big Daddy""!!!The guys at 2K Games knocked the ball out of the park yet again with Bioshock 2, further building and improving upon and already near flawless Bioshock series, adding sooooo much more content and switching things up to bring a new exciting side of ""Rapture"" to the playing field in the form of bigger, badder weapons, power-ups, skills and enemies.Visually STUNNING!! even tho the game is a couple years old, it still holds up very well, artisticly speaking, the style is gorgeous and the entire atmosphere just sucks you into the game, from time to time I get lost just staring at the beautiful work of art that is Bioshock 2.Sound design is some of the best in the industry, the old timey 30's-40's music/voice work and magical sounds and explosions from plasmids and awesome steam punk weapons, the screams and laugher of the inhabitants of Rapture and the distant clinks, drips and bangs of a leaky underground City all come together beautifully in 7.1 surround sound, so satisfying!Gameplay... WOW... it almost feels endless the possibilities and combos of each Plasmid and weapon, the multiple ammo types, perks and skills and even the level design itself if used properly is deadly, everything just flows together perfectly, you can tell this game was made with love and attention. The story/lore of the Bioshock series is the bread and butter, the core and the main reason we all fell in love with the series, Big Daddy, Little Sisters, Splicers and that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Andrew Ryan will forever be engraved into our memories, so much to read, listen, see and explore in the vast underground city of Rapture, so much going on at all times, no wonder you'll get lost in this game for hours on end!I can literally go on and on for days about how awesome the Bioshock series is, amazing how each game in the series gets better and better, they out do themselves everytime and I look forward to any and all things Bioshock in the future!!11/10			"

												In the underwater metropolis of Rapture, lies one of the most exhilerating, tense and memorable experiences that will always be known in the history of gaming. Bioshock 2 tells the untold story of Subject Delta, the Big Daddy who broke free, the Big Daddy that everyone has turned against, and his relationship with a specific little sister of Rapture, Eleanor. 2K Games has designed a game that expands Bioshock's mythology, but doesn’t lose any of the mystery. A game that introduces fascinating new settings and characters, but doesn’t forget or neglect those previously established. A game that gives the player devastating new power, but balances that with devastating new fear. A game that takes chances and makes changes, but almost always for the better. Playing as a big daddy, Bioshock brings destructive and fast paced arcade combat with the help of creative plasmids, setting alight, lifting trash cans and hypnotizing every single big daddy you come across. But in this mysterious dystopia, exploration is key feature to the immersion and overall enjoyment of this title, whether it is the hunting of little sisters, being hunted by big sisters or the spamming of the 'search' button. Much like its predecessor, BioShock 2 is slower and more methodical than your average shooter, but combat feels much more natural and effective than it ever did before. But I never said it would be easy.......nononononono. Being a Big Daddy sure does make you a badass but at the same time a vulnerable slow target that is very well suited to the games strengths. Rapture is a dark, dismal world that envelopes you with a blanket of isolation, excellent art direction, a great soundtrack, and a fantastic voice cast all team up with a powerful story to create an atmosphere so thick and intense that it is at times downright chilling.

												In Bioshock 2, you take control of a ""Subject Delta."" A man geneticly who-knows-what'd to, and then put in a giant blocky diving suit, forced by un-willing love towards a small (Equally who-knows-what'd to) child to seek out and protect her, lest he collapse into a coma, and die.It's a pretty cheerful game.Your tiny, coma-stopping, girl friend is the daughter of a sudo-communist dictator, in an underwater city named Rapture. When that dictator decided you've been Wall-Flowering for too long, she has a bunch of her goons hypnotize you, before she makes you shoot yourself in the head, in front of said coma stopping little girl.It's a pretty cheerful game.You wake up for unknown reasons 10 years later, and the underwater city is in a point of decay. bits of ceiling are missing and rooms are flooding. The only humanity left are insane and blood thirsty, addicted to a gene modifying drug called ADAM. Your little coma preventing girl is now a teenager, and you need to traverse the collapsing Rapture in order to reconnect with her. All the while her mother is sending the entire city in a religious frenzy to stop you at all costs.It's a pretty cheerful game.All jokes aside, I couldn't recommend this game enough. It's a solid and atmospheric sequel to the more philosophical Bioshock, but with improved combat, and visuals. You'll have to explore a more linear world than before, but the set peices and earie vibe more than make up for it. Definitely a must play if you're a fan of the Bioshock series, or just a general fan of shooters, horror, and want to call your games High Art.8.3 / 9			"

												BioShock 2 is obvious and palpable improvement of its predecessor. Every aspect of the gameplay has been finished, the action now frantic and without a breather, to level design that manages to hold off the drama of backtracking. The plot is compelling: an equal quality in the narrative will find it very difficult in another first-person shooter and the progress in the adventure can stimulate the player's attention by offering something new, it's a weapon, a plasmid or unusual setting particularly well. But problems remain: the game does not excel technically and many of the additions in the gameplay, as the underwater sections, leave the time they find. But above BioShock it is partly a victim of its own heritage. Too many parts of the game they know they ""already seen"", from environments, and nothing of this second chapter can match or surpass the splendor of his predecessor. BioShock 2 is beautiful, really beautiful but it is a masterpiece.			"

BioShock 2 deserves more loveLet me cut straight to the chase. Is BioShock 2 as memorable as BioShock? Perhaps not. Is the story as amazing? No. Is the story flawed in some senses? Yes. Is it a bad game? No, absolutely not. BioShock 2 is great in it's own right. It maintains most of the fantastic elements found in BioShock but (in my opinion) improves game-play in several ways.Positive:- Still fantastically atmospheric- Main story is OK BUT the story in Minerva's Den (DLC) is incredible.- Minerva's Den is really worth your time- One plasmid and one weapon equipped at the same time. YESSSSSSSSS!- Hacking system is greatly improved- Hacking from a distance!- Exploring is still as rewarding as ever - you'd be surprised how many places you can go- BioShock 2 is challenging, especially fights with Big Daddies/SistersNegative:- Main story is not as memorable as BioShock- You have to fight Big Sisters, even if you choose not to harvest Little Sisters (this makes no sense to me). But fighting them is still enjoyable.- I did not enjoy the multiplayer scene. There were very few players and some players were already at max level. Let me tell you, it is extremely difficult to play against someone with so many advantages. It is a shame because the concept is really solid. Conclusion:If you enjoyed BioShock I would urge you to give BioShock 2 a try too. Yes, the reviews are not as positive as they are for BioShock, but what really matters is your personal enjoyment of the game. I can say that I certainly enjoyed playing BioShock 2, and I think you would too.			"

-Quick Review-BioShock 2 is a First Person Shooter sequel to BioShock, the second game was released  3 years after the original (Release date: Feb 9,  2010). The game feels very much like you've returned to the city ""Rapture"" for more game play, however events are taking place about 10 years after those that transpired in BioShock 1. -Detailed breakdown review-Story:  Welcome back to Rapture, please keep your arms, legs, and morality inside your big daddy suit the whole time and enjoy the ride! Jesting aside, this game is dark and twisted... which is what most people seem to love about it.In this game you play as a ""Big Daddy"" (Basically the guy you see on the cover art, big armored behemoths) named Delta who is searching for his ""little sister"" (those little girls with the red demon eyes) named Eleanor.Just like in the last game as you play you unlock new abilities, weapons, upgrades for your weapons, and (""force skills that require that blue stuff"" Sorry, I can't help myself) Plasmids that require EVE to use. The game is very linear with no going backwards through levels, the game is rather challenging (unless you relish huge challenges, in that case this game is probably too passive for you. Basically the difference in difficulty is just how hard your enemies hit, not AI difficulty etc.)Game Play: Controls for this game are standard, the big difference between 1 and 2 is that you can keep more passive abilities called ""Gene Tonics"" active. There are a couple new weapons and a handful of new Gene Tonics.The starting weapons are the same ones you had in BioShock1, I don't want to spoil any of the next weapons just know they're fun, but I tend to find myself sticking with the bread and butter weapons. There are new secondary ammo types, for several of the weapons. I won't lie, I really like setting traps.It should be noted that I felt like I was playing in the exact same city, graphic-wise the whole city feels exactly the same with small changes. I don't like to talk about graphics in video games but for me this actually did feel like a continuation of the first BioShock Game.   Achievements: There are three types of achievement categories in this game: single player main story, Multiplayer competitive, and DLC. At this time I'm still working on many of the achievements (12/17/14) I have a majority of the single player achievements, nothing unusual to report on these achievements. The multiplayer ones require playing until max online level, so that will be a bit of a grind, it is also oftentimes difficult to find people to play with (depends on the time of day). Lastly DLC achievements, which I have always felt is a cheap way to get more life out of a game. (Blame the sims3 and EA, okay? That's why I'm so cynical about paying for DLC. haha) Price:  BioShock 2 is priced at $19.99, I acquired my copy from a Humble Bundle, so as usual I recommend getting the game on a steam sale or in a humble bundle. Since this is an old game, if you don't already own it I recommend waiting for a 75% off or better sale.As far as quality is concerned, I have 14 hours in this game and about half of the achievements, I think it's close to a good buy if you're just playing through the game once, if you're going to play on a higher difficulty, or through the game multiple times this game is a very good quality. Conclusion: Story = Awesome. Game Play = Effortless, natural and fluid to play. Achievements = Meh...could be better. Price = Fair. This game tends to appeal to people who like First person shooters and story games, with the addition of multiplayer it could appeal to the competitive crowd but there aren't nearly as many people actively playing.I recommend this game for people who like darker stories, and tend to enjoy first person shooters, regardless of their difficulty. Rapture will warp your perceptions of ""right and wrong""; as always, I've been impressed by the story.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update April 10, 2015:Here's the URL to see my review for BioshockHere's the URL to see my review for Bioshock Infinite "

												The main improvement over the first Bioshock is the storyline. To me this is centred on the main characters' unbreakable bond to his 'little sister' Eleanor, for which he would do anything to find and protect. There is also a sorrow and sadness to Rapture, the underwater city the game is set in. The ruined state of the city is captured in superb detail, and the glimpses throughout the many windows of the ocean add to this atmosphere. The diaries of some of the characters help to pull you even more into this immersive world.In Bioshock 2, the enemies were a lot more varied, in both their model and in how they could attack you. Also you could choose who lives and dies out of characters other than little sisters, giving you a greater feeling of involvement in the story and its progression. The music in Bioshock 2 cannot be overlooked either, and is used to great effect in places to give the 'retro' feel to Rapture. The sorrowful sounding string-quartet in the background during some scenes turns them into truly breathtakingly sad moments.Now add to all of this the gameplay, which is seamless and natural, complimenting rather than obscuring the storyline and mood of Rapture.

												BioShock 2 stunning, unique, incomparable game, I am glad that this game exists in this world, going through this game, I had the feeling that I did in this city, this dirty, alien, chaotic city, this unique shooter. This game has an incredible story, this city has an incredible, amazing story. I think of it we love him, I would recommend this game and give it an 10/10 points.

												A rightful sequel, that doesn't disappoint, improves a truckload of things and manages not to screw many things either. Hacking is finally fun, even if a little easier. Exploring rich philosophies and thoughtful characters and their visions, motives, fates is the game's main driving force, because the gameplay becomes boring after first two hours, because you are swimming in ammunition (just like in the first game with the exception that here it comes too early to be forgivable) and new genetic modifications that are inspired and original though absolutely useless cannon fodder from the gameplay view. Again the same technical problems as the first one, only a little worse. The story, the world and the characters are very well done and that's what BioShock is really about. Lack of Ken Levine here, will surely be compensated by Infinite, that will maybe even surpass the original.			"

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.There are moments in Bioshock that will live long in the memory, such as the first time you saw the spooky underwater city of Rapture from the safety of the bathysphere, or being forced to take part in Sander Cohen's sick games. There are fewer stand-out moments like these in Bioshock 2, but the moments that do stick with you are so well conceived and unbelievably well-executed, that they surpass those of the originalThe biggest change made to Bioshock 2's gameplay comes from the fact that this time around you're playing as a Big Daddy, but not just any Big Daddy, you play as the first Big Daddy, a prototype called 'Subject Delta'.Overall: If you are a fan of Bioshock you can not miss Bioshock 2. If this is the first time you play Bioshock game, this game will be Welcoming you.			"

												i enjoyed the first bioshock. no more no less. liked and disliked too many things to love or hate it. For Bioshock 2 however, the intro was awsome, the very first few minutes were pretty cool but the first few overall hours SUCCCKKKED. You are now the Big Daddy.... and nobody fears you, you do 0 damage, and get two shotted practically. but at about the three hour mark the game develops a plot, you gain supplies and weapon upgrades and boom. You trully feel like the monsterous beast you wer intended to be. I have not yet completed the game, i will modify the review if my opinion changes, but as of now i would recomend this game on sale, if not then it is up to you, if you would give the first game 3/5 or better then this is a good game to grab. Just get through those bumpy first few hours!			"

												Better than Bioshock 1.Particularly Minerva's Den.Before getting the drill, I was all like ""Eh, this is pretty much Bioshock 1 but slightly less system shock 2 I guess"". Then the drill got added to the inventory and it became extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good.Minerva's Den is absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic, and worth  buying the entire game just by itself. They also understood that without the drill,  the game would just be a workable shooter, so they did the right thing and gave you the drill at the very start. Just because of Minerva's Den, and the DRILL, I like this far more than Bioshock 1.			"

												Holy moly, I don't have any playtime on this game on steam because I played it on my xbox back in the day. Let me tell you, this game and the original Bioshock + Burial at sea DLC for Infinite. Together this is the ultimate video game story! This game has one of the deepest, most interesting and emotional stories of all time. I cried at the end of this game when I got the bad ending.This game starts off continuing from the bad ending for the first game, you have been stuffed into a Big Daddy suit and biologically linked to a little sister, however you are killed and revived in a Vita Chamber years later. Your little sister has since grown up and it is now your task to find her before you mentally deteriorate by not being with her. And while you're at it figure out what to do with your killer who is the sister's mother.That's all I'll say for the story, the graphics are very pretty and unique but starting to get slightly outdated today. Still no one should play this game for the graphics, this game's charm lies entirely in it's story and gameplay.Another thing to boast about in this game is the music, boy is the soundtrack for this game solid. The very talented Garry Schyman is back again and created another beautiful score, it's hard to describe how beautiful it is so just go give it a listen on youtube or something. Also give the tracks from the good old days a listen, there's some really old but good music in here. One song I really like in particular is Boby Darin's Beyond the Sea.So overall this game deserves a solid 10/10. There is absolutely nothing I don't like about this game, in fact there's nothing I don't like about this entire franchise, in my opinion it is the perfect video game franchise. It fits my taste perfectly and all my love goes out to 2k and Irrational Games.			"

												Bioshock 2 continues to say a story of the Rapture, undersea colony and I believe the emotional outcome of the game is very individual. Gameplay is lots of fun, with interesting foes and levels, captivating atmosphere and music. It points out various aspect of human nature and has lots to offer.""Love is just a chemical, no matter the origin. We give it meaning by choice.""

												Sequel 101: Take the original and make it bigger, better and more violent. Bioshock 2 covers its bases well with expanded gameplay, stage design and enemy variation. The story lacks the surprise twist from the original, but it makes up for it in buckets by simply being a better game. The original Bioshock was a surprise hit from 2007. It offered incredible atmosphere, a riveting story and entertaining gameplay. All the ingredients for an instant classic. The sequel had a lot to live up and it took a slightly different approach. Incredible atmosphere, an entertaining story and literally riveting gameplay. For the sequel you get to play as a big daddy, the huge lumbering divers on the game’s cover. Arguably the most intelligent design choice for a sequel since Terminator 2. Bioshock 2 is an insane power fantasy. You play as an armoured badass in the run down districts of the once shining city of Rapture. You are subject Delta, an old cover model and you are called back from the beyond to rescue your daughter from some head-shrink. Yeah, the story is a bit thin, but your motivation is clear: Save your daughter from a psycho and kill, murder and maim anyone who gets in your way. Playing as the big poppa gives you access to the iconic drill, a rivet gun (earlier pun intended), a huge machine gun, an elephant gun that has no business being fired from the hip, a spear gun taken from the bow of a whaler and a rocket launcher that probably fell of an armoured truck. In your other hand you command the forces of nature to shock, roast and freeze your enemies. You are a one man army and you are not going to let anyone get in your way. To compensate, the enemies are more numerous and aggressive. You’ll often fight against dozens while also hacking and setting traps at the same time. You’ll also brave gauntlets against an incoming tide of enemies while you defend your little sister helper while she’s gathering valuable power-up juice. The addition of these standoffs is a welcome one and adds some serious meat to the gameplay. Setting traps allows for some really creative tricks. This goes on from start to finish and gets more intense along the way. No difficulty falloff here. Difficulty in general; Bioshock 2 is quite challenging in its own right. Enemies hit hard and never stop attacking. So even on normal does it present a good challenge (unlike Infinite’s 1999 mode, which was as easy as shooting fish in a barrel.) Furthermore, the city of Rapture looks just as gorgeous as before. Ok, maybe the textures are a bit washed out, but when the place is flooded, everything looks washed out. One major problem persists the game and that is the stability. Bioshock 2 has a nasty habit of crashing to desktop for no apparent reason. I’m still vexed as to why it happens, but it annoys the living hell out of me and it has me save every ten minutes to prevent losing all that progress. Also, the controls are somewhat of a mess. You’ll have to tinker with them, but its manageable. There’s also a multiplayer mode…which I’m not even touching. I came here to drill people and save little sisters; and that’s just what this game lets you do.  "

												Bioshock 2, brings us back to the Steampunk-styled, dystopian alternate universe, where you have to unlock the mysteries of a city at the bottom of the ocean. I fell in love with the series after a short time playing the very first Bioshock. Bioshock 2 takes the story from Bioshock and continues it, deepening the mystery and making the player hunger for more. I found myself wanting to immerse myself in the story and learn all I could once again, while trying to survive not only the hidden things lurking around corners, but the scattered people who seem to have gone completely insame. I would recommend not only this game, but the entire Trilogy, as it was fun, exciting, and worth at least a playthough.			"

Only have around two hours in it and I'm hooked, the story is great, the gameplay mechanics are great and the game has a really unique level design & playstyle to it. I love how it has a steady mix between action, and then it has this really creepy susepense to it where you're caught off guard every time.Would definitely recommend, especially for two dollars and to get the HD remaster for free with it.Thanks Rotgrowl for buying me this game bud, you rock!

												There are just a few games that gets stuck in my mind as 'O fekkin' Wow!' This one doesn't give it away in the first few hours. The first time I started to play I left it behind after a hour or two. A year later someone told me I must be out of my mind to not at least give it one play through. I reread some of the reviews and was convinced that I missed something. So I gave it another try.......glad I did. Bioshock is damn damn good. Not only the story. The atmosphere, the story, the weapons....so damn good. I'm playing the DLC now and when I finished that I'm going to do it all over again on 'hard' mode.			"

												Sequals usually fall flat when people play them. Not very often does a sequal come by that impresses and wins over an original games audience. Lets face it, Bioshock 2 is a cash in on the success of Bioshock. Despite this, it does not fail as game, nor as a sequel. The overall gameplay of this game is far superier to that of the original. The weapon variety maybe not as diverse, and the weapon designs do not change drastically like the original, but still good weapons nonetheless. I mean, what other game can you play as zeus in a metal diving suit, with a gatling gun? In addition to this, the balence is better, the research process is better thought out, plasmids are not stupidly OP anymore, and you can actually get some neat tonics and upgrades to your Big Daddy. The little sister and escort sections are not tedious anymore either, they offer a nice break from the monotony of the main story. This is broken up with some nice tea parties with  former co-workers of yours, and some swims in the community fish tank. The games pacing is fluid from beginning to end, and does not chug at any point, unlike the original.Originally, my main criticism of Bioshock 2, is that it did not have that ""AHA"" moment the original had. Well lets just say that the DLC Mirvenas Den solves that problem. Everything I thought Bioshock 2 was lacking, that DLC contained. What it did, is offered that ""AHA"" moment that made the original so good. At first, I thought the DLC ending would be generic and terrible, only to find out the big plot twist at the end. This twist, along with the ending area/cutscene, offers a conclusive end to the rapture experiance. It finally wraps up the city in a satisfying way, something, neither game alone could do.In short, this game improves upon even facet of the original, maybe not to a shine, but certainly to some degree, and offers a conclusive ending to the original Bioshock series/Rapture. Giving this God-Forsaken underwater dystopia, finally a sense of peace.			"

												I previously did a written review on Bioshock 1 in 2012 which can be found at...http://planetarcane.blogspot.com/2012/11/backlogged-gaming-bioshock.htmlThat might help explain some of my thoughts on the basic premise before talking about Bioshock 2 itself. Now I know this game got a lot of flack when it came out. Both over the fact that it had multiplayer and that many felt it didn't live up to the previous game.I actually have to say I disagree on the second point. I enjoyed the story MORE in Bioshock 2 then I did in Bioshock. At a first glance the idea of playing as a Bid Daddy, these hulking monsters seems a tad absurd. But when you stop to think about it, they're not really monsters. They used to be human. Made all the more clear and horrifying in that opening cutscene where the Antagonist mind controls Delta before making him remove his helmet and shoot himself in the head all while we watch the event through his eyes. No I don't consider that a spoiler, it is literally the first scene in the game.The first game makes you stop and think about actions in games. How we just do what the game tells us. Bioshock 2 takes a pair we basically just saw as objects in the game previously A Big Daddy and his Little Sister, then put us in the shoes of the Big Daddy. But not just any Big Daddy, one who has had his Little Sister taken from him. His entire reason for living, not to mention being separated basically puts his life on a timer.And while I won't spoil it, the ending did bring me to tears. I can't deny that. But much like the first game IMO this one also suffers greatly from all the space in between the major story sections. After the opening, there isn't much that happens that is very memorable until close to the end of the game.I also found it weird that despite the situation your character is in, the game still expects you to kill other Big Daddies and take their Little Sisters for you own in order to make yourself stronger. Seems a bit contradictary to the main story.I can't actually comment on the multiplayer aspect of the game, not for lack of trying. I literally could not get a match started, there doesn't seem to be much of anyone playing online anymore.Overall I'd say it's an average game with an above average story. If you liked the first game and avoided this one because of reviews, you might want to reconsider IMO.			"

												Okay, so I've finished BioShock 2 twice now, with different choices and on different consoles.Let me break it down for you.BioShock 2 has an insanely good campaign, utilizing every mechanic you're taught in very diverse ways. BioShock 2 isn't labelled as open world, but there is plenty of exploring to do. There's tons of secrets; whether it be easter eggs, items or audio tapes that reveal the truth about Rapture. The campaign is of average length, depending if you're a completionist or a speed runner. I tried to explore as much as I could, and the campaign took me 8 hours. The campaign is emotional and gripping and leaves you to think over about the events that just occured. It's incredibly immersive and really makes you feel like you are Subject Delta, a deep sea diver who wondered upon the underwater city of Rapture, where he was accepted but not fully trusted. This led to him getting surgically modified; giving him vocal cord modulator surgery and bonding him with his own Little Sister, thus dubbing him a Big Daddy. Also, choices matter which makes it even more immersive as you decide your fate. Overall, I would give the campaign a 9/10, lacking only in some graphical features and seeming rather repetitive in some cases. Still, a MUST PLAY.The multiplayer is very enjoyable. You take the role of plasmid-bearing citizens of Rapture, all utilizing their own looks and characteristics. There is a levelling system in multiplayer, which is pretty cool (only if you play ranked). There are tons of diverse game modes that can keep you rotating through different scenarious and giving flavour (I use UK spelling, sorry Americans) to the multiplayer. There are many multiplayer communities that actively host lobbies (you can check them out on my profile, set as my primary group) which are extremely fun to be a part of. The multiplayer flows very well and has that arcade-y, arena-y feel to it. The multiplayer, I give an 8/10, an intense, fast-paced FPS experience, totally different from campaign.To summarise, BioShock 2 is a great game and a must play. It's one of the best games I've ever played. Don't waste money on the remaster as it does not feature multiplayer and has little graphical improvement. BioShock 2 gets an 8.5/10 from me. Be sure to buy this masterpiece!			"

Sunken, sunken is BabylonI've heard that BioShock 2 is a 'simple shooter', failing in comparison with original BioShock, and I've learned it to be VERY far from truth. This is a great and unique game that actually made me fall in love with Rapture. Some minor spoilers ahead.The level design is superb. Set ~10 years after the end of BioShock, this game features Rapture that now truly became a sunken Babylon, beautiful and forlorn, mysterious and sad. The small underwater parts are a nice touch, I've always wanted to be able to travel the ocean floor! And the part where you are seeing Rapture through the eyes of the Little Sister is also perfect and very creepy, and it adds to the story a lot.And the story itself fits the setting perfectly, and is as interesting and rich as the BioShock's one, or even more so (it's hard to judge but BioShock2 had larger impact on me personally). There are more moral choices you make through the game (a man chooses! *wink wink*), and it helps you to immerse into the narrative, and the narrative reacts to these choices (frankly, hearing Sinclair say 'so a tin man had a heart of gold' made me tear a little). The music and voices are very good too.Gameplay is simply the best throughout the series. You have 8 different weapons/gadgets and 11 plasmids in 8 possible slots, and you can combine some of them (trap+elemental plasmids), and you also use security devices (dear flying bots, Alexander and Diego and Sean and Thoroughfare and Diana and the others I remember each and everyone of you you were my FRIENDS thank you oh I'm gonna cry now), and there are some physical upgrades of various types, and the fully upgraded plasmids felt POWERFUL. The controls and the map demand some getting used to but are handy overall (I hated plasmid/weapon change in BioShock and, though it is perfectly reasonable, having only 2 weapons and a few physical enhancements in Infinite seemed rather restrictive, also, having NO MAP was a nightmare). Some say that guarding Little Sisters while they gather ADAM seems repetitive but I actually liked this kind of challenge - it was fun (with a right touch of nervousness) to prepare the location for the splicers attack using traps and other countermeasures.Overall, I loved the bathysphere atmosphere of the game a lot. There are fewer outright scary moments than in BioShock, but the place itself seems... haunted. Dark, and lonely, and dying, and mutating. Babylon turning into Leviathan.Can you pull in the leviathan with a fishhook or tie down his tongue with a rope?Can you put a cord through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook?Will he keep begging you for mercy? Will he speak to you with gentle words?Play it. Obey. OBEEEEY! Ahem. No, really, try it. Open the seashell and swallow the pearl. See it's glowing?			"

												""Would I recommend this game"" is a difficult question. The game itself is good. It may be the weakest installment in the Bioshock franchise to date, but the weakest installment of an amazing series is still pretty great. The reason I decided to say ""no"" is because of the amount of crap I had to go through just to get the game to play. I have about 16 hours of playtime logged, and I'm willing to bet a good half of it was spent troubleshooting, checking to see if various fixes worked, replaying segments and sometimes entire levels... it got old, fast. For a game that's been out for so long to not have a single fix for everything is pretty inexcusable, especially one that you're expected to pay for. I ended up looking up various guides on Steam and 2K's support forum to get the game to work, uninstalling and reinstalling the game twice, uninstalling and reinstalling programs on my computer, tinkering with files, settings, and compatibility modes, even editing the .ini file itself. The most prominent issues I had were it constantly crashing shortly after starting the game (just when you get the rivet gun), on the loading screen to Siren Alley, the loading screen for Fontaine Futuristics, and near the end of the Fontaine Futuristics level. All of these required multiple attempts on my part to fix and finally finish.On the other hand, my closest friend also has the Steam version of this game and reports not having the same problems. But for any game to give anyone this much problem, I wouldn't recommend spending your money on a roll of the dice to see whether or not it'll work (for the record, I had no problems with the original Bioshock, so don't assume that just because you played through that with no problems, you won't encounter issues here). It's truly upsetting that what could, and should, have been a pleasant, fun gaming experience turned into a frustrating nightmare, and as soon as I got to the ending, I uninstalled and washed my hands of it. Multiplayer? Other endings? Achievements? Forget about it, not worth the grief.If you do decide to give it a shot (in which case I recommend a console version), here's what I thought, issues getting the game to run aside: like I said, it may be the weakest link in Bioshock's Great Chain, but that doesn't mean it's a total waste of time. A lot of the gameplay was simplified from the first game (such as hacking, researching, even the Tonics all being in one area instead of being in four categories with different slots you need to open), some undoubtedly for the better (it's telling hacking and researching didn't appear in Infinite) and some for the worst. There is the mechanic of carrying around Little Sisters and guarding them as they gather, akin to the ending of the first game only much faster and less frustrating (with tonics to maximize ADAM and speed up the process becoming available fairly early). However, there's up to three Little Sisters per level, and each one can gather up to twice. It's really up to you how you decides to handle them, as in the original, but the fact remains you're still going to have to throw down with a Big Daddy and you're still going to have to deal with them somehow if you want ADAM.The main point that this game got a lot of flack for was the story. The game was, admittedly, a cash grab/attempt to keep the Bioshock name alive while Ken Levine and Take-Two/Irrational were working on Infinite, farmed out to 2K Marin. I, personally, think they did a decent enough job with what they had. The story lacked the symbolism and social commentary that made the first one so powerful, and a lot of the mystique and creepiness that Rapture had during the first outing is absent here. I won't even claim the story made total sense in the end (you pretty much need all the supplemental materials, including the dubiously canon novel Bioshock: Rapture by John Shirley, which did have input from Ken Levine, to make it close to solid). And, to quote the venerable Yahtzee, the original Bioshock's story didn't really need a direct sequel. But I wouldn't say the whole thing is a wash, either. For one thing, there's at least two moments in this game (I won't give spoilers) that I personally felt were some of the most powerful in the entire series to date.It really seems like when they were at the drawing board, whether intentionally or not, 2K Marin got it in their head that in making a game that wasn't basically an exact rehash of the first, they needed to make it as different as possible, and ended up creating the original on Opposite Day. WHAT FOLLOWS ARE SPOILERS FOR THE FIRST GAME!Whereas in Bioshock, you play a man that starts out with nothing and gradually finds his purpose throughout the game, in Biooshock 2, the main character has lost everything, including his identity (he's a Big Daddy), and is on a desperate journey, whether out of compulsion or genuine concern, to reclaim the one thing he had left. Whereas Andrew Ryan was a staunch objectivist who constantly extolled the value of looking out for yourself and acting in your own self-interest, the main villain of this game, Sofia Lamb, is a collectivist, with a cult built around being utterly selfless and willing to lay down your life if it would better serve mankind as a whole. Throughout the first game, you're guided by a man who seems kind, helpful, and sincere, but ultimately betrays you and reveals you were an unwitting pawn in his grand plan all along. In Bioshock 2, you're largely guided by a man who is a confessed and mostly unrepentant sleezeball, who makes no secret of the fact that he's mostly using you as a means to get him out of Rapture as well so he can profit off of the technology there. As he knows his plans hinge on you achieving your goal, he's willing to play ball. And let me add that 2K Marin deserves some major props for making a character that is so slimy, yet ultimately charming and likable.All in all, it's a fun game. You won't miss anything for skipping it, especially now that Infinite is out, and I personally wouldn't blame you if you decided to give it a pass and not bother with this slightly subpar installment in the franchise. But with 2K Marin now in charge of the franchise as a whole, it might be worth it if you're a fan of the series just to see how they've handled it in the past. Just, for the love of little yellow duckies, play it on a console and don't waste your time, money, and possibly hours of frustration trying to play the Steam version.			"

												KNOW THIS, the game is great, I enjoyed it alot.The reason it is not recommended, is strictly dueto technical issues.Gameplay:You go through 9 areas in Rapture City in justthe same fashion as in the first game; Taking onBig Daddies to get to Little Sisters, looting deadenemies and every kind of containers you comeacross, obtain and upgrade your weapons, plasmidsand gene-tonics. It's all in there.The main differences being first off how thisinstallment is not as free roaming as the firstgame was, where you could move between the areas.In this sequel, you have to make sure you've doneall you want to do in a level before you move on,because there is no chance going back once you do.Then you have the so called Big Sisters, a newenemy that will make Big Daddies seem like a 90year old, compared to Bruce Lee.Not only are you merely playing as a Big Daddy,you can also do his main-duty of adopting LittleSisters and protecting them, while they collectADAM from corpses to give you more.Controls:Not much to say, the controls are fluent.I can't see anything amiss in them, there areslightly more features than in the first game.Music:It's music includes old real life classics, a newcollection of course, mostly in the Jazz genre.You can tell from the background music when atough enemy is on the way, it gets dramatic.Graphics:The graphics are done exactly in the same delicateway like in the first game, having great water andfire effects.Story:Takes place 10 years after the first game, whichshould then be 1969. You are a Delta model of aBig Daddy, having been shot dead, but resurrectedand stored within a Vita Chamber by your ownLittle Sister, this back in 1959.The 10 years pass, and you awake with your goalof reunite with your, now grown up, Little Sister.Bug and Drawback Listing:*Random crashing, which is the most common issueyou may experience when playing. It may differon exactly how it happens, depending on who youask. For me, the game just shut down without anyinformation at all, close to 20 times in totalduring my whole playthrough.*Hits on enemies just refuse to register alotof times while in battle. This occurs often ifthe enemy is doing some kind of animation whileyou hit it, and is therefor seen mainly on HoudiniSplicers and Alpha Series, as they are using alotof graphical effects. But sometimes even a slowwalking Ledhead Splicer at distance, can somehowbe invulnerable, the shots will just go throughwhilst leaving its impact on the wall behind.This leaves little to no use for the improvedzoom upgrade to the speargun for example.It feels like the game design was primarly aimedfor the player going for the drill and plasmids.While the gun selection is showing a great mix,the hit registration sometimes drags it down.*Enemies can suddenly spawn out of thin air.This causes a problem if you have cleared a roomand are setting up traps for a planned battle.Suddenly random enemies can spawn behind yourback and trigger your traps that you have put timeand effort on for a upcoming fight.Conclusion:I'm afraid I can't recommend this specific portversion of the game.By purchasing this, you are putting it all up tochance. Its a lottery how the game will run onyour PC, depending on a combination of yourhardware, drivers and other OS softwares.Such application behaviour is by me, unacceptable.Get a console version instead.

So i got this one on my pc (because it was on sale) and I already like this game better than the first one. All I can say is, this game is an outstanding shooter with an amazing story, and you can also play as a big daddy so that is a really cool opportunity.

												BioShock 2, the very definition of a misunderstood sequel!And so here I was, about 4 years after I played the original BioShock for the first time (the one on steam was the second) and was left amazed by the marvellously haunting underwater world and history of Rapture, the time had come to see how the story moved on.Truth be told, I am by nature negatively biased towards sequels of great games, since the result rarely is on par with the originals.At the same time, from online reviews and friends opinions I was expecting a generally mediοcre sequel, not really bad, but a lot inferior.What I got instead was a great game that was a lot reminiscent of its predecessor and that at the same time managed to put it's own touch and distinguish itself from it!The game is vastly big, since, except from its main single player story, which is already long enough to be comparable to the first one's, it also includes a multiplayer campaign, plus two more DLCs, so let me analyze them one by one!- The single player campaign, for starters: you start out as a Big Daddy (an older model of it actually), with it's two trademark weapons (the drill and the rivet gun) and the ability to escort Little Sisters at their ADAM gatherings, which I found to be a really nice idea to stand out from the first game, since it gave you the opportunity to see the world from a different perspective.The story is a bit confusing at first, you don't know who you are and what you are doing and I'll admit that, while I initially liked that, as the game progressed on this ""amnesia"" of sorts got a bit tiresome, since it prevented you from enjoying the story and its (small) twists.The first game was ahead in that aspect, since it made you start out pretty much confident about who you were and what you were doing, only to destroy that all at its half, with an amazing twist, one of the best of its kind. However the remaining half of the original BioShock wasn't as thrilling as the first one, though it definitely wasn't bad, just decent.Now, BioShock 2 took another route, to the end of the game you get to know very few things about the protagonist, as, little by little, you learn something more, all until the final levels, where the big twist kicks in and you find all the truth about yourself! The twist was, maybe, just a little inferior from the one of the first game, but it was still very good.Continuing on, aside from the story, the game made some great additions in the gameplay, that improved a lot the old one. For starters, the weapons/plasmids system was positively changed a bit, making them easier to handle, while at the same time new weapons and plasmids were added, greatly differentiating themselves from the older ones.Speaking of gameplay, when I first played Dishonored (another great game) I remember describing it as a ""stealth based BioShock"", well... upon playing BioShock 2 I found even more similarities to Dishonored than the first game and not just in gameplay, but storywise too (ie, in Dishonored you have to save a little girl named Emily and in BioShock 2 one named Eleanor). After all, Arkane Studios was involved in the making of both games, so that probably played its part. However, there too, Dishonored took it's own distinctive path, so I wouldn't call it a ripoff, in fact it even improved on many of these similarities that I noticed between said games (like a fast teleporting plasmid present in BioShock 2's multiplayer, named Aerodash, which was a lot similar to the vastly superior Blink ability in Dishonored... and how much I missed that ability in BioShock 2... ).Moving on, aside from the improved weapon and plasmid mechanics and some new splicers, BioShock 2 introduced an amazing foe: the Big Sister, who essentially was an evolution of the Big Daddy! I found them great for a change in the game's world, since they were really tough to beat and getting ready to ""greet"" them was scary enough, sometimes (I even remember getting ready to fight one and getting my ♥♥♥ kicked, only to be saved by, not one, but two cluelessly walking Big Daddies, that, upon being caught in the Big Sister's attacks, started attacking her as well, saving my lucky self!).Another big change in the gameplay was the ability to ""wirelessly"" hack machines, a change which I ended up really appreciating, despite the hack being done in real time, with enemies potentially attacking you.The graphics and soundtrack were, more or less, similar to the first's, with the former being slighly improved, but nothing too great. In itself that was a good thing, since it made the game stay closer to its predecessor.The game's levels dimensions were also changed, since the first game had many levels split in two parts (maybe because of limitations PCs had at that time), while BioShock 2 had 9 huge levels, which I mistakenly thought to be few at first, though being slightly smaller in total.Lastly, the game's main antagonist wasn't as thrilling as the two ones of the original BioShock, but she was good enough.Thankfully the final levels, upon learning your true identity and onwards, were quite good and action packed, so much that they even provided you with a great ally, which I won't spoil and I'll let you discover for yourself (for a single level you also got to play as a Little Sister, which was cool)!The ending was, once again, faithful to the original, where some of your choices in the game affected its outcome (much like in Dishonored, too).- Changing subject, I'll now go to the multiplayer campaign: overall, I didn't feel satisfied by it and that being because the game had some, difficult enough, multiplayer achievements, while at the same time it was not optimized well enough, resulting in a lot of lag (myself aside, I found others having the same problem too) and in almost empty lobbies, making the achievement hunt quite frustrating.However, that said, the multiplayer part was not all bad, it's gameplay was in fact quite good and balanced (though not entertaining enough) and it took part in a period before the events of the first BioShock, during Rapture's civil war, making it a bit more interesting.- And to the final part, we get to the game's two DLCs: the Protector Trials and Minerva's Den.The first one was not much related to the main story, but not totally unrelated too. Once again reminding me of Dishonored's first DLC (Dunwall City Trials), it comprised of many challenges were you once again assumed the role of a Big Daddy and had to protect a Little Sister during her ADAM gatherings, but with a specific set of weapons and plasmids each time, making the whole thing fun enough, while mixing just a bit of story in it and awarding you with some extra art and trailers of BioShock 2, for every succesful gathering you made.The second DLC was, instead, a continuation of the story and ended up being really good and long just enough to keep your interest on. You once again took the role of a Big Daddy with a mysterious story on its back, immersing yourself in the game's levels to find it out, all of this happening in another, unexplored, part of Rapture, with new weapons and enemies mixed in (the Ion Laser gun being its coolest addition).The DLC's ending was good enough, with the final twist being slightly more predictable than the main game's, but not too much, while at the same time providing a good closure to the world of Rapture.All in all, I found BioShock 2 to be a fantastic game and only slightly inferior to the original, most of it being due to the fact that you were already introduced and familiar to the world of Rapture from the latter. Hopefully the third game, BioShock Infinite, will manage to reignite the marvel of discovering a hidden city, this time in the sky (can't wait to play it as well)!But don't let that frighten you, since you are once again in for a Shock, so... would you kindly play BioShock 2?

												What an excellent game! I bought it a while ago in the Bioshock Bundle (Bioshock + Bioshock 2) and finally played through it. In the beginning I had problems to play the game without crashing but found a solution in the Community Hub. The game was amazing and I really liked the story. The playtime was just perfect, I dedicated an evening to each chapter, but I just had to play the last three chapters in one session because it was so amazing. To everyone hesitating to buy the game, buy it when it is on sale, it should be -75% from my experience. But if you don't want to wait, buy it full prize, I think it's worth it.

												Plain and simple: The story to Bioshock 2 pales in comparison to Bioshock 1.The good news is that when not compared side-by-side, the plot seems to the second installment of the Bioshock franchise is decent. And the better news is that the improvements to gameplay are fantastic. The stupid pipe-puzzle hacking game has been replaced with a new ""stop the dial in the green (preferably blue) zone"" that DOESN'T PAUSE COMBAT. And now you can use plasmids in your left hand and guns in your right. The controls are sooo much smoother. Researching, AI, and enemy diversity are all improved.And then there's Minerva's Den. Get Minerva's Den.			"

												After having finished it, I will never quite understand why Bioshock 2 was panned the way it was. Mechanicly, it's equally as impressive (and in some parts, more so) than its predecessor. Of course after having played the first (and the first being one of my favorite games, period), the mystique of Rapture is worn just a bit, however that doesn't make it any less of an awe inspiring enviroment. The story, whilst lacking a ""game about games"" meta narrative (at least, from what I could pick up), is still well written and superbly delivered. The game is also as good looking as the first. The visuals as well as the haunting orchestral score create a tense and decrepit atmosphere that completely absorbed me, just as the first game did. Bioshock 2 stands shoulder to shoulder with its brothers, and I'd definitely recommend it if you're a fan of either of the other two games.			"

												The second game in the Bioshock franchise and some say it is better than the first, I can't make that statement on either of them because of how much I loved them both.Just like the first Bioshock this one changes the game on how you play a First Person Shooter and adds a whole new way of doing things with perfection to a tee and the added a multiplayer to this as well although it's not in the campaign it is still fun provided you have people to play with but thats no fault of the game. I personaly started out not being able to get into the game and could only get myself to play 2-3 hours at a time (also do to the crashes this game is known for) but then at some point I was hooked and could'nt put it down. The story picks up around the middle and becomes extremely challenging and a lot of fun with coloful characters to fight and get help from and playing as a Big Daddy made a hige difference in the play style of the game. The game looks beautiful just like the first and lets you explore a much different side of Rapture and they also added a bit of religious undertones to the game which I think were an amazing addition because it added to the story a lot without making something a huge part that you were confused if you missed.The only negative to this game is that on PC it crashes a lot and will induce a ton of rage but other than that perfection again.10/10			"

												Exploring BioShock 2's Rapture side places, I was totally confused of the amazed grapping city!The original BioShock and BioShock: Infinite were so much better than BioShock 2; The two of them had over the top elements in each hand also BioShock 2 had it too, but BioShock 2 ""can't"" be compared to both, although is BioShock 2 is alot more than you think right now. The BioShock franchise is totally uncompared to others.to me, no other developer can make a franchise that counts over the 8.9 rating. BioShock franchise have the best unique stories, endings and gameplays. If I say, what is the best franchise in gaming over all the had been playing franchise? I would ratherly say, It's a piece of cake question, goes to pretty eaisly BioShock franchise.BioShock:Story: 10/10result: 9.2/10BioShock 2:Story: 10/10result: 9.1/10BioShock Infinite:Story: 10/10result: 10/10BioShock Franchise:94.3% AmazingBUY THEM ALL!

												You can call me a hipster, but I like this one more than the original or Infinite. There's just something about this particular story, these particular characters and this particular Rapture, that was amiss in the other two. While Bioshock established Rapture as a location and told a story of its founder, Bioshock 2 focuses more on the lives of Rapture's ordinary inhabitants, and boy, does it add to the immersion. The storyline is less linear, allowing an option to spare or kill not only Little Sisters, but bosses as well, which leads to one of 6 endings.The core of the gameplay stayed almost untouched since the original Bioshock, but with some new features. Action-packed harvesting sessions and Big Sister fights are intertwined with the calm and tranquil seabed walks. In addition to previously seen weapons, you have Big Daddy's iconic drill and Rivet Gun at your disposal. Also, you can use both weapons and plasmids in a fight, without swapping one for the other (for me personally it seemed kind of stupid that it wasn't like this all along).In short, if you just finished Bioshock, and can't get enough of Rapture, get Bioshock 2 in a heartbeat. You won't regret it.Also, playing as a Big Daddy is beyond cool. 10 drill dashes out of 10.			"

												Well... Where to begin...The game is really fun to play, pretty long campaign,Graphics are fine(but who cares about graphics).Tho my game crashed sevreal times (Actually alot) but the storyline is well made so i continued.One of the reasons i played this game is because the adorable creature named ""Little sister"", how can you not love them, Learn to be True daddy and take good care of your “Little sisters”.So far this is one of my 4 Favorite games to play.To sum up, i recommend the game to everybody, it does worth the time and money to play itPersonal Score 10/10 "

												I found this to not be as ""scary"" as the original, but it had a lot more action in my opinion. There were definitely improvements in the combat (i.e. plasmid in the left hand, weapon in the right hand). This is a great ""sequel"" to the first game. It essentially leads off right where the first one ended. I will not spoil the story in this review, but this game provides great insight into the big daddy and little sister relationship.I played this game on the hardest difficulty for my first play through, I have not tested the other difficulties, but I would only assume them to be child's play. If you played the first one through, I would recommend playing this on the hardest difficulty.I plan to complete the game again and acquire all the achievements I missed from my first play through.If you have played the first Bioshock and enjoyed the story and game play I would recommend playing this one through as there is a lot of interesting backstory and improvements in the game play.*Purchased Bioshock Triple Pack from the Steam Summer Sale			"

												Bioshock 2 is a huge disappointment in comparison to Bioshock. The game's story was kinda blah, and well felt in it's own way too similar to the first. Unlike some I thought it was cool that it was in Rapture again, but they did not have to have the story completly the same.In Bioshock 2 the game is much different. In Bioshock 2 you are a Big Daddy. Instead of tommy guns, pistols etc. for weapons, you get Big Daddy weapons. This may sound cool, but it is not as exciting as it sounds. The game is in many ways babified, in they simplified things that did not need it. The hacking was simplified so easy a child could do it, and they give guides for things like the eve system that were straightforward to begin with. The game in general also feels more simplistic than the first Bioshock.The Multi-player was really blah and I think they could have made a better single-player if they spent more resources on the single-player instead.I originally owned Bioshock 2 on the Xbox 360 and got it in a 3 pack on steam for PC. On the Xbox 360 the game was stable, on the PC you have to turn off advanced graphics features offered by DirectX 10 to prevent it from constantly crashing, which is pathetic. I guess I would be mad if I did not get it almost free.I highly recommend getting Bioshock 1 if you have not played it, I only recommend 2 if you want to see what the story is like. I warn you, you will probably be disappointed. The only reason I am playing through it again is to get the steam achievements.			"

												TL;DR: Bioshock 2 is better than Bioshock 1 and you should definitely buy it.Improvements over Bioshock 1:-Dual wield plasmids and guns-More smooth gameplay-Level 3 plasmid upgrades-More moral choices-Your choices having a more detailed impact on the ending-Better preformance on newer systems-Some cool new Plasmids-A few new guns-More unique gun upgrades-Deeper exploration between litle sister/big daddy link-Cool multiplayer (pretty much dead now, but it's there)Improvements in my opinion (subjective):-More empathetic main villain-A better final boss fight-Cooler companion characters-I love the little sister defence sectionsNeutral:-Same environment style. Just as good as 1, but we're used to it by now so it's not as effective-Several Plasmids are reusedWeaknesses to Bioshock 1:-Stealth is nowhere near as prominant-A few bits of the story drag (Looking at you, Siren's Alley)-You'll be swimming in loot at the end of the game, removing most challenge-Doesn't have a huge twist in itOverall, this is a game that got alot of bad rep at launch just because it wasn't made by the orignal creators. Still, it's easy to see lot's of love went into this game. In fact, a few of the ideas from Bioshock 2 were taken into Bioshock Infinite. Now, more than ever, it's totally worth picking up for a blast of the Rapture experience.Now, would you kindly go and take your daugter back?			"

												This was a good sequal to its predecessor. More variety of enemies than the first, the characters were memorable but not as memorable as the first Bioshock. The music choice was very good for this game and it was so good that you would listen to the loading times longer than you need too cuz of the excellent choice of music. This is way much better than ""Infishit"" and has the most polished gameplay out of all the three Bioshock games because of dual wielding and it didn't feel like a ♥♥♥♥ing CoD game like what Inifnite did and the drill was very fun to use.

												Spoiler free summary:Sleek, interesting sequel, a worthy successor to the first game. Difficulty curve starts out a little high, and the MC takes way too few hits to be considered apprpriate for an Alpha-Series Big Daddy, but I'm willing to dive into it for the challenge, as well as to see what happens next. However, I cannot recommend it as this game crashes more frequently than tweens caught texting behind the wheel. Seriously, this game's been out for about six years now - there is no acceptable excuse for this.			"

												Bioshock 2 is another great game to the series. There are alot of aspects of this game that I liked and some i didnt like about the game.I'll start off listing the positives: + Great immersive gameplay.+ Wide variety of guns to use and some old ones from the past game.+ Story takes place back in Rapture again for the unique atmosphere.+ This game still had a creepy vibe till the very end.+ DLC was enjoyable and really expands on the game.Here are some negatives that come to mind:- I had 5 random game crashes where my game didnt end up saving. (To fix put ""-dx9"" in launch options.)- Some sound issues were present while shooting and getting hit by enemies.- While playing on the hardest difficulty I still found the game pretty easy.- Big sisters will ♥♥♥♥ you till the end. :(Overall this is a good game and I do recommend it to anyone.My Rating: ★★★★☆PS: Play Bioshock 1 for the story.Play Bioshock 2 for the gameplay.Play Bioshock Infinite for both aspects.

												BioShock 2 is one of my favourite games. Some time after it came out, I saw it was getting spit on and dismissed, but I didn't really pay attention to that, as I assumed it was the all too well known kneejerk reaction of the smug fanboy portion of the players.I got it and went in unbiased. I don't want to compare it to the others in terms of which I think is best, because I love them all separately and as a whole, but it does quite a few things better than the other two titles. What I can say is, I think 2 had the best combat out of the games, because there were so many possibilities, especially with the dual-wielding and the plasmid trap combos. That's not to say I think the combat in 1 or Infinite wasn't good; in fact, I liked it in both games, although less in Infinite. Of course, the latter had a variety of Vigor and weapon combos as well, but not nearly as big as 2.BioShock 2 also improved on many mechanics like the Camera, plasmid use, hacking, Little Sister interactions, upgrading, as well as things like the visuals and more. However, what I most love about it is the bond I felt with Eleanor and how my actions actually changed her character and demeanor. I really wanted to help her, I wanted her to be safe. And seeing the statues of me rescuing the NPCs through the Little Sister's eyes really made me emotional, as did the whole Little Sister adoption and subsequent saving mechanics. It was so touching to see how playing a merciful, forgiving Delta changed how the NPCs reacted to you and pretty much established you as the most human character in the game, even though you were, as Sinclaire roughly put it, a ""tin man"". And who can forget the Big Sister fights? They were the ultimate test for your skills, weapons, plasmids. And the ending monologue Eleanor does for the best ending, as well as that pan of Rapture with the main theme of the first game and her saying, ""And then, Father, the Rapture dream was over."" Man. That was one of the several moments in the game where I teared up and felt introspective about the whole (at the time) BioShock world.""The Ocean On His Shoulders"". How fitting indeed.I really like Lamb as a villain as well, because she was so different, yet almost as well-designed as Andrew Ryan in some aspects.I was invested all the way throughout BioShock 2, as I was with 1 and Infinite. I went in without prejudice and I got one hell of a good game out of it, so I can strongly recommend it.			"

												This is the best Bioshock. The combat is actually pretty fun, and the weapons convey the heaviness and power of a BigDaddy in a way that is, dare I say it: ""immersive"". Instead of plinking away at bullet sponges, you are tearing most enemies (even late game) apart like so much water-logged toilet paper. Very few games are willing to let the player feel like a mini-Boss, and I really liked it here. I also enjoyed the plot more this time around. It doesn't have any bits as cool as the ""Would you kindly"" twist, but overall the combination of the story, and the characters fits together better.  "

I thought I'd see for myself when the game was on sale for cheap and I have to say I disagree completely. The game is a lot more shootery than Bioshock, and a lot of the things that made everyone say ""wow"" when they saw the first game for the first time is not that effective anymore, but this is still a really good game.

												BioShock 2, and indeed the entire BioShock series, is not a game, but a work of art. The story is a tad abstract, but also deeply relevant: what is the essence of humanity, of self-improvement? How far is too far?If you are looking for a thinking man's FPS, this is what you've been searching for. Even if you don't enjoy FPS/story-driven  games, you need to play BioShock and its sequel. I also strongly suggest getting the Minerva's Den DLC, which is fantastic.That being said, if you don't own the series yet, wait until September when 2K release the remastered collection. Highly recommended otherwise.			"

												Review for Bioshock: Here.Review for Bioshock Remastered: Here.**Note: This is NOT a review for the Remastered version. If you would like to see my Bioshock 2 Remastered review, please click here.*Excuse the play hours. I've much more on console and the Remastered version.When Bioshock 2 was announced, it unleashed a shock-wave of excitement throughout the gaming community; its predecessor had been a monumental success, and people could not wait to see what the sequel had in store. Born three long years after the original title, it's safe to say that Bioshock 2 did not disappoint in terms of gameplay, visuals, and setting, although many fans agree that the plot and characters are not quite as memorable as those from the first installment.The game begins in the year 1958, two years prior to the events of the first Bioshock, and shows the main character that you play, known as Subject Delta, patrolling Rapture with his Little Sister, Eleanor. Some events happen, and the game fast forwards ten years later to the year 1968 (not 1970 as the store page misleads you to believe). Subject Delta, also known as Johnny Topside prior to his conversion into a Big Daddy, has set out to find Eleanor, who is now a young adult in her teens. Time is pressing, however, as the longer a Big Daddy is away from his Little Sister, the higher the odds of him slipping into a coma are. There's but one problem standing in your way, a highly manipulative and slightly insane woman named Sophia Lamb. She has replaced Andrew Ryan as the main antagonist, while Augustus Sinclair helps guide you throughout Rapture through radio messages. Yes, you read that right. This time around, you get to play as an actual Big Daddy; arguably the most appealing feature of the entire game. You can also take on other Big Daddies to take their Little Sisters, and you can protect them as they're harvesting ADAM from angels. After letting the Little Sister gather from two angels, you take her back to her vent and choose to either harvest or rescue her. Harvesting or rescuing Little Sisters has an impact on the end game cutscene, and there are a total of three different endings. New to the tried and true Splicers and Big Daddies are now Big Sisters, which wear much of the same gear as a Big Daddy but they're much slimmer, quicker, and deadlier.Another improvement to the gameplay is the ability to wield both a weapon and a Plasmid at the same time, where as in the original Bioshock you had to constantly swap between the two. However, there's a huge glitch in the game that causes your left arm, which is the one that uses Plasmids, to disappear until you either die or get talked to by Eleanor. There are also a new assortment of weapons, such as the drill, grenade launcher, and speargun, and there are a mix of new and old Plasmids to enjoy as well, 11 in total.Bioshock 2 feels a lot more linear than its predecessor, as there aren't as many non-essential rooms to explore. However, the lush environments and fantastic atmosphere more than make up for the overall closed maps. A huge feature, aside from being a Big Daddy of course, is being able to occasionally venture outside of Rapture, onto the ocean floor. The oceanic scenes and moments spent underwater are beautifully crafted, and make you realize just how small you are in comparison to the immense structure that is the city of Rapture. The Art Deco style has been down-scaled in this installment in lieu of a more steampunk style, which ends up coming full circle in Bioshock Infinite.One thing that really brought this game down was the inclusion of a multiplayer element. I'm not even sure if the servers are still active anymore, but I did play some multiplayer on console when the game was brand new. Like most games that should stay as a single player experience but don't, the multiplayer was terrible and mostly consisted of death matches between Big Daddies and Splicers. I'm not alone in my distaste for the multiplayer element, as you will see most other reviewers also scorn it as well. This 'feature', however, has been dropped in the Bioshock 2 Remastered version.Is Bioshock 2 better than the first game? Absolutely not. It's nowhere near as memorable in terms of story or plot, but the gameplay is where this title really shines. Playing as a Big Daddy is satisfying in every imaginable way, from the killing and being able to use a drill, to protecting Little Sisters and helping them harvest ADAM. It's the experience that fans would've been continuing to ask for until we got it, but luckily 2K had the foresight to just go ahead and do it. Sophia Lamb is definitely not as charming a villain as Andrew Ryan or Atlas, but she does have her moments. It's a worthwhile experience for the fan of the Bioshock universe, just don't go in expecting as gripping of a tale.Rating: 4.0/5.0 - Excellent, highly worth playing.𐌕𐋏𐌄 𐋏𐍈𐍂𐍂𐍈𐍂 𐌽𐌄𐌕𐤔𐍈𐍂𐌊 Curator | Group 𐌂𐌋𐌆𐌂𐌊 𐌅𐍈𐍂 𐌾𐍈𐍂𐌄			"

												The red headed stepchild of the Bioshock franchise, Bioshock 2 was the game that was made by another studio, has a multiplayer mode people felt it didn't belong and continued a story people didn't think needed to be revisited. That's probably what you know about this game. Well, I for one say Bioshock 2 is great, worth playing and shouldn't be skipped. It feels more like a side story that takes place after than a true sequel but Bioshock 2, and its DLC Minverva's Den, has a enjoyable story on its own rights with a better implementation of morality and multiple endings than the first. It's also the only Bioshock game I found to be balanced and enjoyable to play during the entire run. It offers more insight into the Big Daddy/Little Sisters relationship and true nature and its themes tie arguably closer to Infinite's than the original Bioshock.			"

												Its a proper sequel which expands not only on the story but also on the gameplay of the 1st. The only problems it has are technical issues such as broken DX11 mode and the occasional glitches, but despite all that I think this is the best Bioshock game all the way through. Minerva's Den DLC is excellent as well. I recommend playing this one first and then playing the 1st one which is also phenomenal in it's own right, then play Infinite.			"

 Bioshock 2 > Bioshock > Bioshock Infinite.And with this statment I could end it here. Bioshock 2 is an incredible steampunk thriller rpg fps game. OST at its finest, the story will definetly catch you. Multiplayer is something you can avoid, for the single player mode is the MAIN thing.You'll have a large variety of weapons as for powers (both active and passive abilities), high interaction with the environment, AI smart enough.Highly recommended, but only after you played the first chapter of the saga!Vote: 9/10. One point missing because they tried to make something as basic as the first weapon more powerful as the game goes on, but they forgot about some other weapons, such as the second, which is kinda useless after the third level.

												With minor gameplay improvements and noticeable graphical improvements over its predecessor, Bioshock 2 is a worthy successor which delves further into the dystopian city of Rapture. The storyline is not as gripping, perhaps because so much is already known about Rapture from the first game. But a few new gameplay tweaks make the combat much more interesting than in the first game and as a result make up for what the game lacks in unique atmosphere and interesting storytelling. Overall, it is worth a purchase for fans of the first game looking to see more of Rapture and enjoy the gameplay a little more during the ride. 8/10.			"

												Well.. BioShock 2... The premise is the same as in the original-Rapture, the underwater 'utopia' turned into hell when things go south. This time, I realised the character plays a big daddy (which is a pain and difficult to handle in the original) which goes by the name 'Subject Delta'. The gameplay in this one was almost the same with the original, with some extra new features like 'rescuing' little sisters from other daddies and to choose whether to gather adam, save or harvest them. In a way, the choices that you made (as well as killing other characters) will affect the decision at the end.The graphics is awesome as always along with great music. With some scenes where you get to go outside and stroll around underwater, the details (and items hiding there) are great. As the game progresses, you are helped with a few characters along the way (e,g, Sinclair and Eleanor). You are also helped with the usual upgrades throughout the game and what surprises me is that the number of secondary plasmids are heaps more than the original! Combined with some new weapons, different hack systems, defensive games (while little sisters gathering adam-be quick little one! I'm already using plasmids to make you gather more and work faster!), great audio logs, and nonetheless great story.Well.. for the verdict...Score: 9.2/10While the fighting system had improved by leaps, it felt slightly... off. I couldn't explain exactly what, but I guess it was because of the high expectations of the original. I was expecting a bigger twist, and something that the original lack, satisfying finale.All in all, this is a great game to play and a very good sequel try, knowing that numerous games failed to deliver on their sequel.

												The first one already was a strong experience; but I think I can say this second opus really deserves more love. I know a lot of the original Bioshock fans sulked it a bit for not being written by Levine and made by Irrational. But frankly, this sequel is very good on many points. First, and that's only my opinion, I find it way more ""cinematographic"" than the first one, so in a way, a bit more immersive, although the first really was a champion in that domain. It's also, still in my opinion, a bit more touching and stronger, in a matter of story and characters. Now for the gameplay, it's very similar to the first, exept for the glorious, simultaneous use of the weaponry (both Plasmids and weapons can be use at the same time).What else to say? You play as a Big Daddy so, by itself, this is a nice touch. :3----------------------------------------------------------------------------Le premier était déjà une expérience forte; mais je pense pouvoir m'avancer en disant que ce second opus mérite plus d'attention. Je sais que de nombreux fans du premier l'ont un peu boudé pour la simple raison qu'il n'était pas signé Levine et Irrational. Mais en toute franchise, cette suite est excellente sur tant de points. Pour commencer, et ça n'est là que mon opinion, celui ci est beaucoup plus ""cinématographique"", donc, d'une certaine façon, plus immersif, bien que le premier était déjà un champion dans ce domaine. Il est également, toujours selon moi, plus touchant et fort en terme d'histoire et de personnages. A présent pour ce qui est du gameplay, très similaire au premier, l'utilisation simultannée des Plasmides et des armes est on ne peut plus bienvenue. Que dire d'autre? Vous jouez un Big Daddy, ce qui est, rien que ça, une touche d'originalité non négligeable. :3			"

												Pretty nice game so far... It's weird to play a Big Daddy this time around, but nevertheless it's quite fun. They tried to change the game a bit, but in general the HUD and the plasmid and tonic system hasn't really changed. You can also decide between harvesting and rescuing the little sisters again. I, myself prefer rescuing them. Furthermore I play on hard difficulty, it's challeging in some situations, but it's quite managable, so, if you played the previous game, go straight for the hard difficulty.I Haven't finished the game after 11 hours of gaming, this also indicates, that Bioshock 2 is a good game, because you try to get every point of adam you are able to gather and rescue every little sister (at least for me, that is), also I tried to find every secret path and thus every diary.In conclusion I have to say that Bioshock 2 is more of an Add On (at least it feels like one for me) than a real stand-alone game. But if you played Bioshock 1, you should also try out this game (there is even a multiplayer-mode).			"

												Outstanding game and sequel, I actually enjoyed Bioshock 2 more than the original due to the new weapons like auto turrets, rivet gun & the drill. I liked the fact that the game emphasised using strategy and teamwork at times in contrast to just mowing down all the enemies by yourself and the auto turrets were especially a nice addition which complimented this.  In terms of the story, Bioshock 2 had a few twists but I felt the story wasn't as fleshed out this time around, however don't be mistaken, as the story is still very powerful in Bioshock 2 and is by no means a slouch. There was plenty of new characters who had convincing back stories and the game also alluded to some of the characters from the previous game which was a nice touch. On the contrary though, the plasmids could of been updated a little more as if memory serves they were the same ones from the original so it would of been nice to see new plasmids. Overall though, i'd definitely reccomend Bioshock 2 to fans of not only the series but fans in the fps genre as well & anybody who enjoys a thought provoking story.			"

												While I feel that this game has the weakest story out of all the games in the Bioshock trilogy, I definitely believe Bioshock 2 has the best gameplay. For one, dual wielding has been added, meaning you don't need to wait for your character to switch between having a weapon and plasmid out in the heat of battle. Because you play as a Big Daddy, the game has expanded upon the ways you can collect Adam to upgrade your plasmids. Like before, you can choose to harvest or rescue Little Sisters, but now you can also escort Little Sisters around so they can harvest Adam off of corpses for you. Also, hacking has been drastically improved. Not only can you now hack machines from a distance, but also the pipe minigame has been removed, being replaced with an extremely brief timing-based minigame that will make you want to hack things much more frequently than you did in the original.This is also the only Bioshock game to have a Multiplayer mode. It's a fun distraction, but it didn't really appeal to me as something I'd wanna dedicate my time towards, especially considering how small the multiplayer community is now. I never was unable to find a server to play on, but that's only because there's often only 1 or 2 servers available. That being said, the achievements in the Multiplayer are not only rare, but easy to obtain, so it might be worth checking out if you're into that.One final thing I want to point out is the Minerva's Den DLC. This extra campaign is definitely worth picking up, as it's extremely well written and designed. It's definitely better than the main storyline.All in all, Bioshock 2 is a fun Bioshock experience. That being said, I'd mainly recommend it to people who are already fans of the Bioshock series, as the changes that have been added to the gameplay aren't really enough to satisfy considering the underwhelming storyline. Basically, if you've played Bioshock and want more of the gameplay, play this. If on the other hand you've played the original and want more of the storyline, play Infinite and it's Burial at Sea DLC.			"

												Bioshock 2 is very similar to Bioshock, which is a steam-punk version of System Shock.The story is as interesting and with the same gradual build-up to the peak dramatic intensity of the ending, which is great. Although, some things are confusing, e.g., only after watching an explanation on YouTube, did I understand that Bioshock 2 protagonist is not the same as in Bioshock.They simplified the hacking system, made it more faster. The hacking in the first part was overkill.The enemies are basically the same, only brute splicers and big sisters are introduced. And it's fine with me. What else to think of, if it's the same environment with the same inhabitants?In overall, I can say that Bioshock 2 doesn't offer nothing radically new, it feels more like a remake – the way the Bioshock should have been made.Bioshock 2 offers a smooth RPG-FPS experience with an interesting story. It feels somewhat repetitive, as I approach each level in the same way and all the levels feel the same, too, although the difficulty is gradually increasing. At times I felt almost bored, but the last 2 levels compensate for that, as the story gets really interesting. And the ending is really, really cool. As in the first part, it is determined by your moral choices during the game.My overall rating is 7/10. It's a good game, but I wouldn't recommend to play it right after you have finished the first part, as they are very similar and you might get fed up with the Rapture environment.It's also quite short (less than 14 hours to complete the story), but, I guess, if it was longer, it might have been overkill.The game also has extra missions (to defend little sisters in different levels), which I personally didn't find interesting to try, and MP, which also offers some co-op challenges, however it is almost dead and it's hard to find at least 4 players to fill the arena.The Minerva Den DLC: a nice addition to the core game. 7/10. Reveals the true identity of the protagonist.			"

												An outstanding sequel to the original.  Graphics and sounds are clearer, crisper, and eerier than before.  The story brings you back to Rapture for an entirely new adventure that you'll absolutely devour.  Deeper and richer lore for Rapture, a story with plenty of twists, and new enemies that will freak you right the f*** out and push you to the edge in battle.Controls have been modified a bit and might throw you off if you play immediately after BioShock, so I highly suggest customizing them to suit your comforts.  Many of the weapons/powers are the same as the previous game and the upgrades operate in the same manner, so this might strike you as a tad bit stale (but it's still a blast regardless).9/10			"

												This is another great game, though it doesn't exactly live up to its predecessor. The mechanics are much the same as the previous installment, though some minor improvements have been made to the combat and genetic skill trees to make it slightly more fluid. All this taken into account however, the story feels like much more of an afterthought than did that of the first game (probably because, to a point, it was). Although it is still a great shooter, you don't lose much of the bioshock experience by leaving this particular installment out. Great mechanics, great atmosphere, great graphics, but the story is definitely lacking.			"

												To help put things in perspective, know that I first had completed Bioshock 1 and Infinite in my gaming lifetime. An odd order, yes. But it did help put things in perspective, both the evolution of the series as well as the reviews associated with it.In terms of gameplay, Bioshock 2 is a straight upgrade from 1. The looting and exploration is just as enjoyable as it was before, and bullet stock micromanagers will have a moderately satisfying day. The game isn't too hard, even on the highest difficulty. It may be rough to start out, as you don't have the Plasmids and Tonics yet that befit your playstyle. But as time passes on, you will be able to gather your bearings. As long as you somewhat try to use your ammo sparingly or at least wisely, you will have maximum ammo on most of your weapons, and your wallet will be full as well.A feature I've always liked, as money in this game isn't as much a currency as it is a resource which you can hold only a limited amount of. I've always admired how Bioshock's ""Money"" dynamic made it stand apart from many other shooters and RPG's and what not.When keeping visual design in mind, changing from a 'human splicer' in the predecessor to an 'alpha version Big Daddy' brings a visual change that really helps you immerse in the role. All the former weapons are present, but in bulky versions befitting what you are. The revolver is replaced with a Rivet Gun, but still fires just like it, the pump shotgun with a double barrel one and the crossbow with a spear launcher. It's a detail, but an important one.As a Big Daddy, you are still tasked to defeat other Big Daddy's to lay claim on their LIttle Sister. With the new weaponry and evolved plasmids, this task has become much more interesting. Setting up traps and following your plan like a script will help you get some proper first blood damage in, and then you can finish off the bugger with your weaponry. A task that is still quite intimidating, as the melee Daddies still know how to quickly close in on you, and the ranged ones carry some very hefty firepower. Even as a Big Daddy yourself, you'll need to Tonic up before you can take a prolonged beating. Wits are still very much required.And these wits will serve you well, as now you can fullfill your role as Big Daddy when finally claiming a big sister. Beyond the options you had in the first game, you can also have the Little Sister harvest ADAM from specific corpses. Each little sister can only harvest twice, and there's always more corpses than can be used. So exploration for more ideal locations does pay off.Which is where your trap laying skills yet again prove handy. Instead of taking on a mobile Big Daddy, you now need to strategically defend a stationary target while she drains adam. The act of draining seems to always attract a big crowd of Splicers. And it needs no explaining that the Splicer AI is well capable of ambushing you now if you think of cheesing it out.Not to mention the Big Sisters, who always come for you when all the Little Sisters in the level have been dealt with. They are pretty much twice as strong as a Big Daddy, much more agile and beat your face hard with an array of Plasmid skills. Being unprepared generally leaves you dead and beaten.But worry not, because you've got a new wide array of new and/or improved Plasmids to help you defend. Whirlwind Trap alone is a poster boy of this, as you can now imbue Level 2 traps with any other Plasmid skill you have, adding a unique feature to the trap. Ranging from Shock and Fire, to Hypnotise traps. The latter is especially handy to place with a Little Sister, in case a Splicer reaches her. Send that f*cker right back to fight his friends, or into another trap.Pretty much all Plasmids gain unique features with every level. But the Tonics get very interesting as well. Basic ones as Boozehound are now accompanied with reducing Eve usage, and there even is a Tonic in the late game where you can drastically reduce your Eve usage in return for only using your Drill (your new Melee weapon). I have tried the Melee build, using damage reduction and melee damage increase, and I can guarantee you that it's quite viable. Doing a Drill Charge (a skill the storyline will teach you) is very satisfying and lethal, although quite taxing on your Drill Fuel.Speaking of the Story...It's a mixed feeling. Of course it's not as impressive as the first one was. That said, it would take exceptional work to make that even possible. The story isn't bad, and certainly gives you enough encouragement to go on, it's just not as good...Which does explain why Infinite tried so hard to focus on it's story counterpart, sadly leaving behind some of the features we had loved the first two for.If you liked Bioshock 1 and want more of it, this game is absolutely worth it. If you think Infinite couldn't get any better... well, maybe you'll like it less, but it might still be worth it to put some context to some of the Infinite DLC.All in all I would say it's been a worthy successor, filling that Bioshock hunger I was having.

												Game crashes a lot making it unplayable. I've tried all the fixes that are avalaible on internet, but that didn't matter. To make it all worse it has no autosave and thus losing gametime or hitting hotkeys for quicksave every 1 minute. Wouldn't recommend to play this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port on PC.			"

												Bioshock 2 is a great game...If Levine took the work on it. But we got rehashes of ideas of the first installment, no more categories for tonics (you have only one very big slotplace to put everything you want). Chemthrower now merged with ADAM, and hacking now is remote (which VERY ease whole gameplay,thanks autohacking darts). For every harvested\collected little sister, you somehow get present as was in the first part but also frustrating bossfight with big sister, its the worst part of this game from my opinion. Gameplay now is linear train ride, you cannot come back to previous locations. Talking about locations only last one (Persephone) is greatest map in whole game. Multiplayer is dead, maybe because its boring. I would not advise not recommend this game, even with multiple ending it got low replayability. Buy it on sale.Oh and one thing, inside there is two DLC's: Protector Trials and Minerva's Den. First one is boring escort the sister get the points, cant say more.What about The Minerva's Den. This is the great DLC to play on, even better than the game itself. Really recommend buying bioshock 2 only for minerva den.P.S: Your saves can be crash at anytime! Be careful!  "

												Soccer is for subhumans.My first job was working as a ""Whatever"" guy at a grocery store. I was usually given whatever ♥♥♥♥ jobs no one else wanted to do. One of my tasks was to throw away criminal amounts of ""expired"" foods. This usually consisted of dairy and deli dept. foods, such as sandwiches, dough, etc.When I reached the ""I don't care anymore"" point of my tenure at ""Sav-a-Center"" I would take the trash outside to the dumpster and throw most of it away. Most of it. I would take care to save any raw dough, preferrably those Pillsbury biscuits in a tube, and I would see how high I could throw them against the back wall of the building. It was so satisfying when they stuck onto the wall and stayed there for weeks at a time.Eventually some New Orleans piece of ♥♥♥♥ took over the store and ran it into the ground in 6 months.			"

												It's absolutely fascinating - and a trademark of the Bioshock series - how Minerva's Den manages to turn a plot about regaining control of a central computer into one of the greatest love stories told in videogames.Also, one little detail at the end of Minerva's Den gives us - in retrospect - a measure of the savvy with which the world of Bioshock is constructed: in the office of Charles Milton Porter you find a color TV (http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/File:Standby_tv_color.png) powered up by three brightly colored tubes that stick oddly into it. Playing through both Bioshocks you see so many grayscale / sepia monitors (most of them with that frozen 'Please Stand By' logo on them) that they actually become a trademark for the series. And at the end of Minerva's Den when you see that color monitor you cannot help but feel that it doesn't belong there, that it cannot be 'in' Rapture, it must be there from somewhere else, from another world, like a seed of a new world that sprouts in dying Rapture, maybe, and you get the feeling that not only the ocean is finding its way into the ruined city, but another - more colorful - world is also leaking through the cracks in Rapture's broken reality and this could be, in retrospect, the moment that Bioshock's universe opens up to the Multiverse that will take the stage in Infinite.

												Story was overwhelming. Great Setting. Rich Characters. Awesome Pro/Antagonist. But all this great things about the game is just leaving me a little yet big impact on my experience, the game is buggy as hell on Windows 10 Pro x64 it always crashes on my PC. It can really let the exprience down so yeah, unless they fix it or patch it to support Windows 10 I'll recommend it but for now its a No at the moment. So they've announced a Collection Edition for the game I hope they have fixed this issue in that Edition.			"

												Years ago I played BioShock 2 and I had to restart the game over and over again because of the instant game crashes. I never found the solution, yet I played it anyway. Because I was in love with the game.Months ago I bought the game from Steam and I was sure the crash problem never solved, but I was wrong. The command -dx9 at the preferences screen totally solves the problem. I cannot express that feeling, that happiness.Because I know, I will never ever get tired of playing BioShock 2.

												Great action/shooter game with RPG elements. Whole Bioshock franchise is driven by fabulously written story, plot twists, interesting not black white characters in areas you wouldn't guess for a regular shooter. I love the whole series as ashamed I was when I started exploring this world with actual last game, Bioshock Infinite on PS.++ Story++ Characters+ Plot twists+ Plasmids+ Weapons+ Areas+ Got to play as Big Daddy- Repetetive fighting- Can get frustrating from grinding and killing same enemies over and over9,5/10  ""For every choice, there is an echo, with each act we change the world.

												While BioShock was a statement game and served as evidence that creativity doesn't come at the cost of commercial success, BioShock 2 follows along a familiar path for sequels. It doesn't take extreme liberties with elements that worked before; it improves them in simple but effective ways.To those who've been playing FPS games for years now know that this genre can be different from the default patterns.Still, like many sequels, what you get with BioShock 2 is a number of tweaks and improvements to gameplay.When it comes to story, unfortunately, none of the characters introduced in BioShock 2 are quite as fascinating as Andrew Ryan in the first one.My point is, if you enjoyed Bioshock, you'll like this one. But if in the end of the game, you were already tired.I don't think this is the game for you.			"

												Please note this review assumes you have played the original game 'bioshock'Bioshock 2 is a direct sequel to the previous installment 'bioshock'. Set years after the orignal release in bioshock 2 you play as a failed 'prototype' big daddy which i think was a great feature. Similar to bioshock, in bioshock2 you have to kill big daddy's, and rescue or kill the little sisters. However bioshock 2 expands on this where you can also use the little sisters to harvest additional adam. In every level after saving all little sisters, a big sister will hunt you down which you can kill for additional adam. I like how bioshock2 expanded on this and it gave the game the feeling that you really are a big daddy looking after a little sister.The new Toxins concept is brilliant and far better than bioshock1. Also hacking was a nightmare in bioshock1 and in bioshock2 i actually loved hacking, it felt fun to do unlike in BS1 where it felt like a grind.Pros-Combat is far superior compared with bioshock1-Guns are more fun to use compared with bioshock1-Does not get boring near end game unlike bioshock1-Improved Toxins conecpt-6 Endings compared with bioshock1's 3 (This could be good or bad)-Hacking system is wayyyyyyy better than bioshock1'sCons-Short game length (less than 10 hours on standard difficulty)-Bioshock1's story was more indepth and superiorIn conclusion i dont see why this game gets criticized compared with the original bioshock. It improved from bioshock1 in almost every aspect. The story is better in Bioshock1 but the gameplay is far, far, far superior in Bio2.If you enjoyed Bioshock1, you will most likely enjoy this game.

												For those of you who have played the original Bioshock, you will be right at home in Bioshock 2. For the rest of you, go play the original Bioshock first; if you don't you will be more than a little confused.A little background first: both games take place in a city called Rapture located on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. It was created as a utopia where you could choose your own destiny without the interference of governments or organized religion. As you can imagine this didn't last, and by the time you show up in the first game Rapture has deteriorated into a big free-for-all. The man who created Rapture, Andrew Ryan, serves as the main antagonist in the first game.The second game takes place eight years after the first one, which is surprising because I can't believe that the city continued to function for that long. You play as a Big Daddy who has been gone from Rapture for ten years.The city is now under the control of a psychiatrist named Sofia Lamb, and you have plenty of reasons to hate her. In direct contrast to Ryan's exaltation of the individual, Lamb is all about everyone working together. I find it interesting that all of these people who came to Rapture specifically for self-determination are suddenly working for Lamb.In Bioshock the end cutscene depended on what you did to the Little Sisters you found: did you save them or harvest them? In Bioshock 2 there was more to it. In addition to the Little Sisters, there were several characters who you could decide to spare or kill; different situations surround each choice. I have heard that there are something like 12 different endings to the game depending on what you decide to do. This is one of the significant things that they improved over the original game in my opinion.Other than that though I felt that the story wasn't quite as good as the original. While it wasn't too difficult to understand where Andrew Ryan was coming from when he went on his rants, I really couldn't understand the reasoning behind Sofia Lamb's plan to create a perfect society. Speaking of Ryan, many of the characters and recordings talked about him and their opinions of how he ran things; clearly Rapture was still living in his shadow 8 years later. I felt like Bioshock 2 was similarly living in its predecessor's shadow, especially because the creative minds behind the first game (read: Ken Levine) weren't directly involved in the second.The area that Bioshock 2 made huge improvements in was the gameplay. In the original game you had to switch between your weapon and plasmid, but in the second you always had both available to you. This alone made battles much more fast-paced and hectic. There was also more variety in enemy types; the splicers are a lot more deformed, presumable due to the extra years since the first game, and there are now brute splicers. They aren't quite as tough as Big Daddies but they fill in the gap between weak foes and really tough ones. The scariest enemy that they added was the Big Sister. They come after you sometimes after you have rescued a Little Sister, and they are tough. They use plasmids and melee attacks, and they are extremely nimble. I couldn't get a screenshot of them while they were alive because I was too busy trying to shoot them, but here is a dead one.There were new weapons as well: the metal pipe you wielded in the original game is replaced by the Big Daddy's Drill, and I took malicious pleasure in pinning enemies to walls from afar with the new spear gun.raphically Bioshock 2 is beautiful. The environment was almost identical to the original, but you can immediately tell the difference when you look at character models from the two games.			"

												After I finished the original Bioshock 1 I immediately wanted the sequel to see how it would continue and what happened after the first game. I wanted a game that would show me just what happened after Jack left Rapture and the city was left to rot for 10 years at the bottom of the ocean. I guess I got just what I want, which is probably my main complaint about this game. It feels like afterwash from the original in a way that it feels like I'm playing a DLC for the original or maybe even reading a fan continuation. The environments you got to explore, while still pretty cool, weren't usually as big or as major to Rapture as the ones and Bioshock 1. I feel like they should have added the older locations into this game on top of the fresh environments to make it feel like you're going through the same city. Also, to make sure that people don't get confused about the lore, no more bathyspheres. The story isn't anything to write home about, either. You control a special Big Daddy named Subject Delta who, can you guess what the main conflict is going to be? Yeah, he's looking for his Little Sister who was kidnapped. I mean, she was already kidnapped, but she was... Kidnapped... Back... It's a bit predictable, unlike the Bioshock 1, but the story still held suprises for me, even without a major twist in the middle. The characters have to be either the best or the worst thing in this game when it comes down to it. I really liked the characters like Sinclair, who reminded me of Atlas from the first game and Eleanor, your little/big sister. The antagonist was... Okay to say the least. Like the first game it had a pretty powerful message with it but I felt she talked a little too much. I know. It's a pretty stupid thing to complain about, but when she radios you every 5 MINUTES SAYING THE EXACT SAME f*$#ING THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN YOU GET A BIT TIRED, OKAY? As for the other characters, they were kind-of forgettable. Each section has a different character belonging to it, and at the end you get to either kill or spare them. Now, the endings system is alot bigger than Bioshock 1's was as in there are 6 endings instead of just 2. It has the same Harvest or Rescue Little Sisters system (with a fun Little Sisters protect minigame thing!) But, like I said, it also has different characters to kill or to claim mercy on. First is Grace, who I could understand sparing. The second guy I could also understand sparing and still being labeled as good. But the third guy, oh my gosh why are you even supposed to spare him and still be labeled as good? He begs you to kill him in audio recordings because he's insane and he is a giant mutant blob who can't move for Gods sake! How are you helping ANYONE by not killing him? I actually didn't know what to do when I got to this point because they both seemed bad thing to do. If you do kill him, you get labeled as a murderer in the ending, though! But what about those hundreds of splicers and big daddies you mowed through like overgrown weeds! They're insane too, but don't they deserve a chance at life if a giant mutant blob who can't move does? All in all, I liked the new gameplay and plasmid system. The weapons for your Big Daddy self were also really cool. I especially liked the one where you could hack from a distance or place mini turrets. Anyway, that's just my two cents on this game. If you enjoyed the first I would recommend it for everything it has to offer.			"

I will keep the short but sweet. First let me answer any question about the game.1- Do I need to play Bioshock 1 to know the goings on in the 2nd?. Answer is no.You will get many spoilers of what happened in the 1st game though.2- Is the 1st game worth playing? Extremely it is held by many as the best game of the bioshock series,its a personal favorite game of all time of mine. 3- Is the Minerva's Den DLC worth playing? Yes it is, its about 5 hours long depending on how much explorinig and 100% stuff you do.The story some consider better than the story of Bio 2. I personally found both stories to be about the same but not impressive like Bioshock 1.Now on with the short n sweet review.Bioshock 2 has a improved combat system over the 1st game. Everything moves more fluid and does not feel lagged at all. The A.I. is as always an enjoyable treat to encounter though the creepy & horror filled vibe that the first held us to seems not present here.However the story of the character you're playing contains the majority of the horror. I won't spoil but you really feel for the guy but not attached to him. Weapon variety is the same as in Bioshock 1 along side the 3 ammo types per weapon/tool. New though is a hacking tool which lets you remotely hack from a distance,very handy and needed in some situations.New plasmids and tonics make a debut as well increasing the variety without detracting ones from the 1st game.There are new variety of Big Daddies this time around along side the old ones of Bioshock 1.New splicers and turrent turrent types make a debut. The enivornments are familiar to Bioshock 1, but not as horrific as it. Quite a few pieces of background info regarding the 1st games characters are found throughout the game shedding more light to the behind the scenes of what happened. The game has a lot going for it, its just many story telling elements were a miss unlike in the first game.If you are a Bioshock fan its worth playing,just I doubt you will make a return to Bioshock 2 unlike 1.Like it or not, its a part of the franchise but story wise skippable in relation to the bigger story of the trilogy.This game is more a ""day in the life of a rapture citizen"" type of thing.Just you are a V.I.P.Tech IssuesThere are some steps you may or may not need to go through before you can enjoy the game as much as possible.I have a Nvidia 450 GTS 1gb vram with its latest drivers and a AMD Phenom II X4 920 2.80 ghz on Win7 64 Pro  and even after doing the crashing tutorial I got crashes periodically. I had the game on Win Vista compatibilty mode with admin privilages turn on.			"

												Little Spoilers inside:Wow...after playing Bioshock Infinite is Bioshock 2 even better!Its probably not a same Rapture as in first Bioshock (you know) Lamb is Comstock(not Andrew Ryan), You are Johnny Topside AKA Subject Delta - ""Booker"" (there is always a man) and Elenor Lamb is of course Elisabeth The lamb! A Special child.Story is not that good but gameplay is - for me thanks to Drill and plasmid combos better that in first one.So if you are new to Bioshock universe you should play it like this: Bioshock 1, Bioshock Infinite + Burial at the sea DLC and Bioshock 2 + Minerva DLC "

												What an awesome game.The story is a bit weaker than that of first game, but its good enough to get the player involved into it.The gameplay is fine, the fact that you play as a Big Daddy is really awesome and it gives another view for the player of Rapture and its inhabitants.But outside the new elements, the game stays mostly true to the first installment and that is definitely a good thing and if you like to hear every bit of the story and the side stories, its really awesome to explore every room and hear every recording, then Bioshock 2 is the game for you.The DLC, Minervas Den is also a great story for players who werent satisifed with just playing the main game and want more action, and then, you have the Protector Trials which are great if you just want to relieve stress and kill some Splicers.9/10. I loved this game and i think you will too, this series is really well done and the story was great with memorable characters.			"

												BioShock 2 is a really fun game. It's a well made shooter with interesting gameplay mechanics. It has a lot of the charm of the first BioShock, albeit with a weaker storyline. View BioShock 2 as more of an expansion for the first, and you can get a good 8 hours or so of solid enjoyment out of it.Also - the DLC for the game (specifically: Minerva's Den) is another interesting expansion pack that warrants a playthrough. It is basically a smaller scale of the full game, but with a more interesting story.It was amazingly fun to come back and play BioShock 2. As I said earlier, I haven't played BioShock 2 since it came out, so it was like playing the game for the first time again. Could not recommend it enough.			"

												 First of all I want to say that this is a review on the singleplayer + minerva's dlc since I've played only those, multiplayer wise I didn't try it or know if there is anyone playing it. I know people think about these game a step backwards from bioshock 1 but I'm inclined to say that I enjoyed bioshock 2 more, I say this because combat wise I say it's better having the ability of just having one power in one hand and on the other your weapon is such a better way of playing this game, I found that bioshock 1 was a bit clunky with that.  The difficulty on this game was harder (played both on hard) than bioshock 1 it had more variety and although big daddies were easier these variety made a difference, in minerva's den though lancers and alphas were much harder even on late build but big sisters were the same it would be just a matter of having the resources or not which I found on Minerva's Dlc to be harder to come by which made a huge difference in most battles. So this is what I liked a lot on bioshock story was also really good, found it more appealing than the first one.  Now for the bad parts which enraged me I will say that for you to play this you need to save manually instead of quick saving because you will get your save corrupted and it will not be fun the only thing that made me keep playing this game and finishing was that it was really good, which is a good thing but for the interesting part about why your save gets corrupted it's the constant crashing to your desktop that happens, I probably had only one boss battle that I didn't had to beat twice due to this constant crashing. But this is not the only bad parts, the controls are cr*p who the f**k uses the ""T"" key to zoom in your weapon? But it's rebindable so you can put your right mouse to zoom in which previously was for your plasmids which in your screen is the left hand so you are shooting plasmids in your right mouse? Wtf and also the game has a mechanic which I don't know why when you have a lot of ammo the game automatically changes from time to time to your other ammo and I got parts in the game where I was shooting with the rivet gun or spear gun trap rivets into bigsister face which she really enjoyed because it did crap damage. In the end though with these 3 negative problems which were persistent to say the least I enjoyed the game a lot and if it was not for that I would be bashing this game but it was good and I recommend it, can't compare it to infinite though because it's the next on bioshock series that I'm going to play.

												Bioshock 2A different approach to this one compared to Bioshock. You play as a big daddy and can use guns and plasmids at the same time, which is rather nice. You can adopt little sisters to gather resources for you and you need to defend them with traps and stuff. It is rather enjoyable. The story is not as good as the first Bioshock game but if you like big guns and plasmids this is one worth getting.7/10Welcome Back to the city			"

The difficulty on this game was harder (played both on hard) than bioshock 1 it had more variety and although big daddies were easier these variety made a difference, in minerva's den though lancers and alphas were much harder even on late build but big sisters were the same it would be just a matter of having the resources or not which I found on Minerva's Dlc to be harder to come by which made a huge difference in most battles. So this is what I liked a lot on bioshock story was also really good, found it more appealing than the first one.  Now for the bad parts which enraged me I will say that for you to play this you need to save manually instead of quick saving because you will get your save corrupted and it will not be fun the only thing that made me keep playing this game and finishing was that it was really good, which is a good thing but for the interesting part about why your save gets corrupted it's the constant crashing to your desktop that happens, I probably had only one boss battle that I didn't had to beat twice due to this constant crashing. But this is not the only bad parts, the controls are cr*p who the f**k uses the ""T"" key to zoom in your weapon? But it's rebindable so you can put your right mouse to zoom in which previously was for your plasmids which in your screen is the left hand so you are shooting plasmids in your right mouse? Wtf and also the game has a mechanic which I don't know why when you have a lot of ammo the game automatically changes from time to time to your other ammo and I got parts in the game where I was shooting with the rivet gun or spear gun trap rivets into bigsister face which she really enjoyed because it did crap damage. In the end though with these 3 negative problems which were persistent to say the least I enjoyed the game a lot and if it was not for that I would be bashing this game but it was good and I recommend it, can't compare it to infinite though because it's the next on bioshock series that I'm going to play.

												After I finished the original Bioshock 1 I immediately wanted the sequel to see how it would continue and what happened after the first game. I wanted a game that would show me just what happened after Jack left Rapture and the city was left to rot for 10 years at the bottom of the ocean. I guess I got just what I want, which is probably my main complaint about this game. It feels like afterwash from the original in a way that it feels like I'm playing a DLC for the original or maybe even reading a fan continuation. The environments you got to explore, while still pretty cool, weren't usually as big or as major to Rapture as the ones and Bioshock 1. I feel like they should have added the older locations into this game on top of the fresh environments to make it feel like you're going through the same city. Also, to make sure that people don't get confused about the lore, no more bathyspheres. The story isn't anything to write home about, either. You control a special Big Daddy named Subject Delta who, can you guess what the main conflict is going to be? Yeah, he's looking for his Little Sister who was kidnapped. I mean, she was already kidnapped, but she was... Kidnapped... Back... It's a bit predictable, unlike the Bioshock 1, but the story still held suprises for me, even without a major twist in the middle. The characters have to be either the best or the worst thing in this game when it comes down to it. I really liked the characters like Sinclair, who reminded me of Atlas from the first game and Eleanor, your little/big sister. The antagonist was... Okay to say the least. Like the first game it had a pretty powerful message with it but I felt she talked a little too much. I know. It's a pretty stupid thing to complain about, but when she radios you every 5 MINUTES SAYING THE EXACT SAME f*$#ING THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN YOU GET A BIT TIRED, OKAY? As for the other characters, they were kind-of forgettable. Each section has a different character belonging to it, and at the end you get to either kill or spare them. Now, the endings system is alot bigger than Bioshock 1's was as in there are 6 endings instead of just 2. It has the same Harvest or Rescue Little Sisters system (with a fun Little Sisters protect minigame thing!) But, like I said, it also has different characters to kill or to claim mercy on. First is Grace, who I could understand sparing. The second guy I could also understand sparing and still being labeled as good. But the third guy, oh my gosh why are you even supposed to spare him and still be labeled as good? He begs you to kill him in audio recordings because he's insane and he is a giant mutant blob who can't move for Gods sake! How are you helping ANYONE by not killing him? I actually didn't know what to do when I got to this point because they both seemed bad thing to do. If you do kill him, you get labeled as a murderer in the ending, though! But what about those hundreds of splicers and big daddies you mowed through like overgrown weeds! They're insane too, but don't they deserve a chance at life if a giant mutant blob who can't move does? All in all, I liked the new gameplay and plasmid system. The weapons for your Big Daddy self were also really cool. I especially liked the one where you could hack from a distance or place mini turrets. Anyway, that's just my two cents on this game. If you enjoyed the first I would recommend it for everything it has to offer.			"

												Bioshock 2A different approach to this one compared to Bioshock. You play as a big daddy and can use guns and plasmids at the same time, which is rather nice. You can adopt little sisters to gather resources for you and you need to defend them with traps and stuff. It is rather enjoyable. The story is not as good as the first Bioshock game but if you like big guns and plasmids this is one worth getting.7/10Welcome Back to the city			"

												Touching story with a twist at the end . . . as expected from a Bioshock game! Reviews said this was not as good as the 1st and the 3rd and that this entry in the series was the weak link, but I found it the most entertaning of all. Also the Multiplayer is not as bad as people say, it still has a lot of players and it's easy to get into it. Also the SP DLC is great since it delivers another well written Big-Daddy story that takes about 3 hours to complete!!			"

 Amazing!  Again a awesome game to play, a must have for a real gamer. After buying the triple pack and playing the first BioShock,I immediatly had to play BioShock 2, because I was so excited about the first game.And ofcourse, it was an amazing experience. The same dammly gameplay as the first Bioshock.With a new setting and meaning in the same feeling of the amazing story line of BioShock.In the first BioShock, the main setting was like: 'Become a 'Daddy'After that, you got a lovely daughter and everything was fine.In this game, 10 years after the events of the first game, your daughter has been taken away from you, and your mission is to find and get your daughter. And then leave the halls of Rapture with her.I highly recommend playing the first BioShock before playing BioShock 2,because it had to be much more fun.Those 2 games are like one game of 20 hours awesome gameplay and a fantastic story.

												Almost did not buy BS2 based on reviews I read. But it went on sale and so what the heck. Glad I did it was better than the first one. It was challenging. the big sisters were not easy and I had to find creative was to take them on such as having a turrent or NPC gun reight there, also found that using a corner or boxed room helped as I could control the confrontation better with traps and mines. Unlike the first one where I got lost or stuck several times, in (2) I only got lost/stuck twice, not bad at all.Its been a few years since I played the first BS but it seemed to me that the NPCs were better, a little more constant as well as aggressive in BS2,  which keped me on my toes.Anyway, it was well work the cost and the story stayed toghter pretty good. So if you haven't played to it yet give it a go.Thanks for the game :)			"

												Bioshock 2 was widely regarded as just more of the same from Bioshock 1. You play as a slightly more mobile Big Daddy, and your quest for the most part is to rescue a particular little sister.There were elements of Bioshock 2 I liked of course. Things like how you dual wielded plasmids and guns. It made combat far more flowly and less restricted like in Bioshock 1. At the same time they replaced parts of the original game. Rather then killing Big Daddies and absorbing/rescuing Little Sisters to get Adam. You protect a little sister from Splicers while she harvests Adam. I thought this was a nice touch and indeed it is a very challenging part of the game.However that's mostly where my favorite aspects ended. The storyline to Bioshock 2, while more or less decent wasn't as engaging as the original. It also featured tacked on multiplayer.However I have to give 2K credit, they patched out GFWL and ported Minerva's Den to Steam. Now Bioshock 2's Steam release is the greatest version of the game.

												A Review Mostly for me so I know I’ve completed the story, as well as feedback on the game.My Thoughts:- the 2nd game lets you play as Delta a Big Daddy and is a lot more fun than Bioshock has MP mode too added bonus to me the graphics look lower than it did in Bioshock but still worth is to play as the Big Daddy Achievements:- 54 of 68 (79%) Achievements EarnedGraphics:- Textures on weapons and characters a nice but seems as the environment graphic are low.Story:- You are Delta a Big Daddy and your Little Sister has been taken you must travel thro rapture and save her as well as yourselfReplayability:- not much to be honest but MP could be fun with a lot of friends to join you, altho MP is mega laggy unless host has good internet.What Could Be Added: HD textures or improved graphics.Rating:- 8/10			"

												Walk into the footsteps of a Big Daddy in Rapture. 10 years ago, you were doing a routine walk with your Little Sister. Now, she is kidnapped and you were knocked out for that duration. Welcome back to the beauty and glory of Rapture...now, quit standing around and work with Sinclair to save your Eleanor who is being manipulated by Lamb!This game has the same single-player feel from the first Bioshock, but with a few changes(i.e hacking). Your actions will affect Eleanor, so choose wisely on what you want her to become! During that time, as Sinclair says, ""You and me, kid. We're going places.""For the multiplayer version, however, could have met it's potential. There are many problems with it. First thing is that it uses peer 2 peer technology for connection with players around the world. There is no option whatsoever to host a dedicated server. You just find a room with the type of game, and that's it. Second, there are a lot of disrespectful people that come online. There is no option to mute them or ignore them, and even ignoring them on Steam doesn't help. Third, by default, your mic is on by using whatever settings you have on Windows(even if you don't have a mic, it goes onto Stereo Mix recording).TL;DR. Single Player is awesome. Multiplayer is good, but with too many problems.			"

												Bioshock 2 brings you back 10 years later, to the fallen city of Rapture. This time, you are a Big Daddy looking for your daughter that you lost to Sofia Lamb 10 years ago. In Bioshock 2, you are pared up with Sinclar, a former hotel owner who survived the great tragedy. As you fight the splicers and other Big Daddys, you get a sense that you are getting attached to this game in a emotional way. There are a few bugs in here but, not very noticeable. 9.1/10			"

												Even though I disliked Bioshock, I thought I'd at least try this game though it's sort of more of the same, I liked playing as a Big Daddy at the end of the first game so I thought it may make me enjoy this game more.I enjoy this game more, overall the game is much more fun. I don't feel bored playing it like I did with the first Bioshock. I like the story of being a Big Daddy, the story is very interesting and gameplay has improved you can now use both a plasmid and weapon at once, it makes things quicker instead of feeling so sluggish like the first Bioshock was so slow having to switch between a plasmid and a weapon.And I like that hacking seems better and you can now hack cameras as well instead of just destroy them.I reccomend having several saves as saving can be glitchy. I saved my game and it crashed in the process deleting the save that I was saving over, I previously had 4 saves and now had 3, so it must of deleted the save which caused it to crash or the crashing caused it to delete?? Iam not sure. It's a joy to be able to alt tab out of game without getting a black screen of death.When you open a map, you can't close it again by pressing the map key, but by clicking on a button at the bottom of the screen that says close or by pressing B on a XBox controller with no way to remap the key for PC controls. Controller exclusive controls on a PC game is annoying.I like this game much more than the first Bioshock, Iam enjoying it and rate it 7/10			"

												If popular opinion is to be believed, Bioshock 2 is a game that suffers under the shadow of the remarkable first game in the series, which is mostly regarded as being the better of the two journeys into the depths of Rapture (that is, if one can actually classify separate journeys into the depths of madness and depravity as being somehow being “better” than one another).  Some of this opinion is warranted, but in other crucial ways this game actually manages to outshine its older sibling.Let’s talk a bit about story and setting, as I feel that these two elements define the heart of the Bioshock experience.  Much like its antagonist, the first game was responsible for creating Rapture, the ugly, decrepit, and rusted out undersea dystopia.  In Bioshock 2 well you’ll sure see more … of the same.  The trouble with a setting like Rapture really is that it’s a bit self-contained, both literally and figuratively.  It’s wonderfully detailed, and there are hundreds of stories to be told (as evidenced by the many audio diaries that reappear in this game), but it’s still a microcosm.  So Bioshock 2 returns you to the same old Rapture you've seen before, to visit the same old menagerie of drug addled psychos you've set on fire before.  In a lesser setting this might prove to be an issue, but that’s just it; the world of Rapture has enough texture and atmosphere that it can still stand strong even if you do have some sense of déjà vu upon your return.  The weight of dread, hopelessness, and despair bears down on you every bit as much as the weight of the ocean around you, which in turn allows you to once again soak in the experience of Rapture.In terms of story, your reaction may depend on how you feel about canon and its role in a larger story arc.  Indeed there are some potential issues here in terms of overall canon.  It takes some firm suspension of disbelief to swallow the premise that the Rapture we saw in the first game survived another 10 minutes after our first departure, much less another 8 years.  The character of Sofia Lamb is bolted on to the canon in such a way that it begs the question, if Lamb was such a prominent figure in Rapture, why did we not hear of her in the first game?  How are there still splicers down here, being that they seem to be a pretty nonfunctional self-destructive lot, and I can’t imagine that they’d be capable of reproduction (nor would I want to … ewww).  So yes, there may be some issues with Bioshock 2 in terms of the overall canon of the series, but here’s the clincher, and a statement which may net me some detractors.  If you can look past the minor issues above, the story in Bioshock 2 is actually better than the first game.  Sorry Ken Levine, but the boys at 2K Marin may have managed to top the amazing story set forth in the original Bioshock.  In the first Bioshock, one of the major premises of the game revolves around the question of, “Why am I doing this?”  (And I’m hoping at least someone answered, “A man chooses, a slave obeys”).  The original Bioshock is brilliant science fiction populated by a colorful rotating sideshow of psychotic freaks.  But it missed a bit of the human element.  In Bioshock2 you know immediately who you are (in a basic sense), what you must do, and crucially why you must do it.  This opens up the opportunity for a more humanist approach to Rapture, being that the resolution of this tension allows for huge opportunities in characterization.  And Bioshock 2 seizes upon that opportunity in spades.  In the first game I was purely vested in the mystery itself which was great, but in this game I was actually attached to the characters as well.  This manages to add some emotional heft to the story which I felt was missing a bit in the first game.  (In truth this is probably helped by the fact that I myself am a parent, and the central themes of Bioshock 2 revolve heavily around what it means to be a parent … err … Daddy)So how’s the gameplay?  Well a lot like the first game, the difficulty curve here is a bit frontloaded.  As you gain plasmids, tonics, and weapons upgrades the game becomes significantly easier.  In some ways this is a bit unfortunate at least insofar as it would have been nice to feel that rush of badassery immediately upon stepping into the brass boots of a Big Daddy.  As it is you start off a bit weak and underpowered, slowly growing into your role as a walking fortress.  And that’s fine really.  It wouldn’t be super-fun or challenging if you started out as the biggest badass in Rapture.  Just as in the first game, Bioshock 2 really finds its groove when you start gaining power-ups to assist you in your endeavor, and it’s at this point that the gameplay absolutely shines.  It’s still an absolute blast to figure out interesting and advantageous combinations of plasmids, tonics, and weapon upgrades in order to rain death upon the doomed denizens of Rapture. There was one element of the first game that I did miss in Bioshock 2 which was the open world component.  In the original Bioshock  you felt the massiveness of Rapture in that you could travel from one end of the city to the other if you were so inclined.  In Bioshock 2 your experience is firmly divided into a level-based structure.  There are plot devices in place to help make some sense out of this particular element, but it warrants a mention.  To say that the game plays on rails is an understatement, being that your conveyance between levels for half the game is in fact a train.  It’s a minor thing, but I certainly would have loved to have the ability to return to previous levels for more in-depth exploration.  Oddly I also found some issue with repetitive tasks in the game, which I feel is also partly related to its strictly structured levels.  The way in which you’re tasked with the repetitive task(s) of rescuing a Little Sister, gathering Adam, dealing with the Little Sister, fighting Big Sister, wash, rinse, repeat … starts to feel a bit grind-y by the end of it.  It also impacts the pacing of the story a bit.  I think an open world setting might have relieved this issue somewhat in that it would have been nice to set my own agenda for handling the Little/Big sisters rather than being forced to handle everything in a level before moving onto the next without hope for return.  Once again this is a small issue in the grand scheme of things, but one that definitely became noticeable to me.  Luckily the combat allows for so much creativity and improvisation that this cycle rarely becomes a dreaded chore (despite my comments on grinding).So there you have it.  I must say that after two games of being trapped at the bottom of the ocean with the worst sort of abominations imaginable, I’m looking forward to taking my Bioshock experience to the sky in Bioshock Infinite, drifting through the clouds … with the worst sort of abominations imaginable. At any rate I found Bioshock 2 to be an excellent game particularly suited for fans of dark science fiction and horror, as well as anyone that enjoys story driven first person shooters.			"

												More of the same; fortunately, that same is awesome. Recommend experiencing BioShock 1 beforehand to gain a full appreciation of the storyline, leaving a few months gap between games in order to avoid Rapture burnout.First order of business: map Quicksave to an easy-to-reach left-hand key and use it often, to avoid repeating segments due to the frequent crashes to desktop.Also recommened: the Minerva's Den DLC.- Skinny from the Fat B*stard (curator link) "

												Bioshock (1) is a masterpiece.Bioshock 2 is awesome, but overall not as awesome as Bioshock (1). What is better:Gameplay: it's almost the same, but it's improved, I'd say it's a bit better than Bioshock 1. encounters with Big Daddy and Big Sister are awesome, the combat is definitely better.minigames are improved too. What is worse:Story\Locations: Nice story\locations, but for some reasons, I think that Bioshock 1 wins without doubt.Graphics: no improvements, Bioshock (1) was released in 2007, with nvidia dsr is still nice. Bioshock 2 was released in 2010 and with nvidia dsr is still nice too, but they look barely the same game. TL;DR If you are looking for a great sequel, you could be a bit disappointed, Bioshock 2 is a nice game, but you'll probably join the ""Bioshock 1 was better"" club. If you are looking for a nice game Bioshock 2 could be a good choice  "

												I can't help but rate this game in relation to its predecessors. System Shock 2 was the scariest game I had ever played back then, and Bioshock was a fine successor.  Bioshock 2  is also a fine game.  Primarily a first person shooter, but with enough customization along the way to feel a bit like an RPG, I would certainly place Bioshock 2 alongside System Shock 2 or Deus Ex as  games that are good enough at letting you do things your own way that you never feel like you're just playing a FPS.

												BioShock 2 suffers a curse that riddles many first sequels: being awkwardly hammered in between an absolute storm of a debut and an absolute killer of a third game. BioShock 2 is the disappointing middle child of the BioShock franchise, a product of a schism in 2K's original BioShock development team, bowing under the pressure of following up a global phenomenon in gaming and coming unfortunately before the series has decided what it actually is. However, in order to discover that, BioShock 2 had to exist.But there's more to it than that - just being a catalyst for BioShock Infinite's success. Although quite lacking in any rigid sort of philosophy, unlike BioShock which revels in it's nihilism and investigation of the perception of ethics, BioShock 2 works hard to reiterate the series' strengths. What it focusses on is everything but the original's cognitive plot, you get graphics, rich world, terror, heart-in-mouth action and an occassional tug on the old heartstrings. The opening movie and introductory level are superb, not matching the iconic opening of BioShock, but that is not an easily done thing by any game. The story and script are not stupid by any means and the game is not bad either. In actual fact it is quite fun playing as a Big Daddy but not as fun as you'd think. If it had gone all out in the brutality that Big Daddy's are known for, fast-paced chaos, carnage and bloodlust, it might have warmed me to it a little more. BioShock 2 however stays safe and tows that line between smart story and brutal, unflinching bad-a*sery, and we are instead given many sequences of wave upon wave of enemy with mines and traps and the occassional drill and plasmid.Still, it was good enough to make me happy as a BioShock entry and it was more than worthy of its namesake. Rapture, as always, is a pleasure to wander around and there is much that is new and much to be discovered. Despite the player character being hard as nails and heavily armoured, the game stays suspenseful throughout and the battles with Big Sisters are always huge slug-matches on the scale of King-Kong vs. Godzilla.Job's a good'n as we say in the UK.

												This game picks up sorta how the first Bioshock left off, you play as a Big Daddy, all big, all oafy and loud.  For fun make sure to play the game on the Hardest Difficulty, anything less and its just too easy.  This game is much shorter than the original but the pace feels good, it never drags, so dont let the length fool you.  The games mechanics are not as fun as the original.  Playing up until Dionysus Park a player can survive if they use resources carefully practicing ammo conservation, but on the Dionysus park level it all falls apart.  Enemies respawn real, real, fast.  Often times an enemy is killed then you walk around the corner and the same enemy respawns so fast and is shooting you in the back.  This is a HUGE problem because enemies dont always carry money to buy more ammo or supplies.  The lack of ammo or money to buy things is where the game breaks down due to this.  This broken gameplay of the weapons running out of ammo way to fast is compensated for by placing vending machines every 15 feet it feels like.  This could have been done less if either ammo was cheaper, or players could carry more ammo.  Being a big Daddy should be all about using the drill, but the drill requires fuel, fuel that evaporates way to fast even after upgrades making those vending machines every 10 feet useful.  The gameplay feels broken spending the whole game going to vending machines, the fuel should have lasted longer or there shoulda been an infinite fuel upgrade for the drill since its kind of the trademark big daddy weapon.  Hypnotize 3 is kinda useless, it lets you hypnotize big daddies which lasts for about ten seconds and worse if they throw a turret hypnotized or not it attacks you.  A good story and a fun game, def a must for bioshock fans.  Kinda thought this would suck and its nice that it isnt too bad.Rating:  7/10  Value:  $7.99			"

												With high expectations, I believed that I would be disappointed. Luckily I was wrong. Yes the game looks and feels very similar to the first one, but there is so much new, lengthy content in this game that makes your visit back to Rapture captivating and memorable. The story is not QUITE as epic as Bioshock 1, but is still intense and keeps you interested until the very end. The combat has changed just enough to feel very new with just slightly modified elements (eg. the ""dual wielding"" plasmids + guns). The weapons are fresh, and I love what they did with the hack system. Bioshock 2 stands as an amazing single player experience.			"

												It's very hard to find a game with such compelling ideals, philisophies and idealogies. This review is not so much a reflection of what how the game function but more about what it provides for the gamer. Bioshock 2, is indoubtly one of a prime classics in our gaming generation of today, if you haven't picked it up yet I highly reccommend doing so. No spoilers here but, the game takes you on a journey and a mystery as you find yourslef constantly asking questions what happened to the rapture? why have the people gone mad? why, when, what, how? I'm writing from a perspective that seeks a game to be more of a game, rather an interactive, immersive narrative. Do graphics still matter to this day an age, some would argue however, none would say this is a shallow experience but rather it is a deep and enriching piece of art. Bioshock 2 will remain to be one of the pinnacles of innovative story telling, but that's just my own opinion, please pick up this game.			"

												A continuation of the Bioshock series, Bioshock 2 puts you back in Rapture as a Big Daddy. A fun FPS with good dual wielding mechanics gorgeous and a great storyline. The experience was unfortunately tarnished somewhat by my initial playthrough when the game was still using Games for Windows Live (GFWL), and I lost my save approximately half-way through the game. I have since replayed it since it migrated to SteamWorks and the experience was far better, but not perfect, with several crashes during my playthrough.Unforunately the Multiplayer is somewhat dead, with little to no matches being played/hosted. However what I did play of it was enjoyable.Overall I thoroughly enjoyed the game (although perhaps not as much as the original) and would highly recommend it to fans of the series, or newcomers if it's on sale.

												I couldn't believe how hard I was after the ending.For a Video Game Dad Simulator, this is pretty fun. There's a shark, a cartoon scientist villain, and more!Varies up the gameplay immensely from the first by giving you a Big Daddy's arsenal instead of the Genericsville gun roster you had in the first game. Plot is leaps and bounds better than the first game, dropping stuff like The Big Dumb Twist in favor of greater insight into the culture of Rapture and it's characters. Graphics do their part to show you more of the ocean aspect of Rapture, more interesting skyboxes and varied viewpoints than the first game.This game has good DLC, Protector Trials are fun and let you master the various combat options you may not have considered going through the game the first time, and completing them offers you an extra method of difficulty for Minerva's Den. Minerva's Den has decent length and difficulty, has a good story, and is not in any way shape or form like Burial at Sea (please do not buy Burial at Sea it is garbage I feel genuinely bad for the poor suckers who got punked 30 dollars by buying those)			"

												Playing video games for the first time long after their release is not always a bad thing. Indeed it enables us to see how they endure the test of time. And only true jewels can stand it. What about Bioshock II ? As I had been blown away after playing the first opus, I expected a lot from this sequel. And so did many Bioshock fans. Here's my review :(See rating at the end of the review)____________________________GAMEPLAY: Quite similar to what we experienced in the first game. The gameplay is really focused on immersive and explosive fighting sequences. The difference with the first opus is that there's no real final boss but very often the player is opposing big waves of ennemies. Hopefully it is possible to prepare your defense by setting traps and mines, hacking security cameras and turrets. But if you want to collect all the Adam, these defensive fights become too repetitive. On a more positive note, some new weapons add more fun to the gameplay. I really enjoyed playing with the drill and the spear gun. Moreover, it's really interesting to combine different weapon's and plasmid's attacks. I liked the fact, that as a Big Daddy you really feel the strength and the weight of your character. There are also different levels of difficulty that you may choose depending on your experience in FPS games. So don't worry if you're not used to this type of game. I'm not, but I still truly enjoyed playing it.VISUALS, MUSIC & ATMOSPHERE: That's why so many people love the Bioshock saga : a deep immersion into an equally beautiful and horrific world. Of course, I already knew how Rapture looked like but I was still surprised by the beauty of the scenery. And even if the game engine is getting older, the esthetic of this chaotic city is still mind-blowing. The new developers have even got further with more cutscenes and submarine exploration that offers quiet and contemplative moments between the fighting sequences. I also have to praise the soundtrack, the voice-acting and the sound effects that are even better than in the first Bioshock.STORY: In this sequel, which occurs ten years after the events of the first game, we play in this sequel a reborn Big Daddy who's trying to get back to his little sister. Our quest offers us the possibility to explore many new places and to meet new cheracters. The most interesting ones are the utopist Sofia Lamb and the opportunist Sinclair who take the roles of Ryan and Atlas in the antagonist-protagonist pattern. Because we are more familiar with Rapture and it's doom, we are less surprised by the wickedness of its inhabitants but there are still some strong revelations. Many elements of the story are smartly scattered in the Audio Diaries that the player finds on its way. And as we move towards the end of the game, the story becomes more and more intense. To me, three of the four different endings are a bit overdramatic but they still have a great theatrical effect. LENGTH: It takes around 10 hours to finish the game. More than that if you don't use the quest arrow. There's four different endings that you can experience depending of your choices, but because the game is very scripted I wouldn't do it all over again. ____________________________  Gameplay 4.5/6   Visuals, music and atmosphere 6/6   Story 4/6   Length 2/2   - -   Global Rating 16.5/20 Even if we are familiar with Rapture, it is still a great pleasure to explore this submarine terrifying world. Bioshock II is not disappointing at all in terms of visual design and atmosphere. However, this sequel is bit more focused on action than on the story. As a result, the gameplay is more entertaining but the story lacks originality.			"

												I came worried that Rapture would lose its magic second time around, and left realizing how much of a fool I was. The city is more amazing than it was in the first game, characters better fleshed out, story more focused and generally everything feels significantly improved. While during the first game I spent the first hours just understanding what the hell the setting was about, this time Rapture felt like bleak home and I could appreciate everything from the beginning without that slow learning curve. Obviously, much of the mystery is diminished since it's not the first time. But you're compensated with better mechanics, stunning environments and a deeper story.Tonics and Plasmids are still a great joy, improving the FPS with light RPG elements of character customization. The variety of active and passive abilities allows you to choose between an impressive range of playstyles. Sneak? Melee? Guns ablazing? Setting traps? Hypnotizing enemies to fight by your side? Use machines to wreak havoc? You name it, you have it. Combined with an unparalled atmosphere and unique setting, using the foundations of the first masterpiece and building upon them, BioShock is 20-some hours of pure fun of the best kind in computer games.I recommend playing the first before the second. Otherwise, you'll have a hard time enjoying the most of the plot. You'll miss out on a lot of characters and spend too long trying to fill in the gaps by what you understand from the events. And this is a game you want to delve into the plot. If just for Rapture, its history and its imaginative premise.			"

												This game is probably my favourite single player FPS of all time, the story is engaging and the whole being a big daddy thing is more than just a gimmick as it ties in really well with the story, all the atmosphere of the first has been maintained, the graphics and art style are pretty much timeless and the voice acting is superb. As for the gameplay i'd say they added just enough to make it feel like it was more than just an expansion. The little sister defenses and big sister boss fights were great additions, the weapon upgrades and new passives fit really well and opened up countless play style options. One thing i love about this game are the journals you pick up, letting you get tidbits of backstory without interrupting the game while you sift through endless text (See: Elder Scrolls, Mass Effect, Dues Ex: HR etc). There are issues with this steam version however, Vsync is broken, DX10 doesn't work and having a second monitor enabled causes the game to crash randomly, all of which are issues i never had with the original release.

												A much more vibrant and refined  game than the original, combat, and hacking is a lot more fluid and the evironment is much more detailed. The narrative is more set in stone but  i feel this helps the game convey its story much better than the original (barring the obvious plot 'choices'). Still a bit too easy so hard difficulity is again recommended.To most a step back compared to the original but with the release of Bioshock infinite i feel this title was unfairly judged and is atleast equal if not slightly better than Infinite due to having far less handholding and and far more interesting characters (barring infinites shocker ending i suppose).Rapture just makes for a much more engaging setting than minor alterations of New Columbia ever will be.Bonus ; The minerva's den dlc delivers another 4-5 hours of excellent (standalone) campaign.

												Update: Minervas Den added!Bioshock (BS1) was probably the best story a video game ever had and really understood the communication medium in storytelling: You just felt sooo angry after all got revealed and the audiotapes next to corpses left a morbid atmosphere of some long faded glory.[The meta stories connect well between all 3 parts. In BS1 there was the capitalistic or self-inherent threat to an atheist society, wheras BS2 is the religious-collectivistic danger to Rapture's ideals and finally BS Infinite is a Newborn Christian xenophobic ""W"" Bush type of state.]But and this was a major ""but"", the gameplay was more or less in a better beta state.Subject Delta, in BS2 on the contrary, experiences a still immersive story and a far more balanced gameplay than in BS1. In Detail:First of all, the Bioshock series ain't RPG but is rather an FPS with strong RPG elements, which includes character building and players' actions which decide the outcome or rather just the cinematic ending, I should say (apart from minor support by characters you kept alive). The level design is in both BS 1 & 2 linear and not open world. BS2 is more tubular than the rather circular maps in BS1, but to the benefit of cutting down on long lonely corridor walks w/o any noteworthy action.Positive compared to BS1:The gameplay is a lot better balanced, due to the fact that: - The one-hit-BigDaddy-killer weapon grenade launcher is given as the last weapon unlike BS1.- The AI doesn't jump like mad onto you as in BS1, but even Houdinis and Spider Splicers act ""normal"" and walk around.- There are no more Nitro (and after half way into the game) no more Thuggish Splicers but all Splicers have a melee and Nitro ability and thus become more versatile in their attack patterns; as well as you got melee abilities with every weapon.- Double wielding Plasmids and weapons eliminates the need of switching permanently during combat- The old research cam system, which dragged the game endlessly, used to be the biggest pain in the a... This got now completely revamped, making it much leaner and faster with less categories, less research levels and a video camera system which rolls in the background rather than draining your patience and health during a fight. Just don't forget to turn on, since the best goodies are now at the highest research level! - There are a lot of good new enemies, like new Big Daddies and one new Splicer type, which add well.- due to the tubular level design, the gameplay is far more intense.- The marketing department finally realized that just by making the main character building resource scarce, it doesn't help replayability. Basically Adam was ridiculously scarce in BS1 with an economic system, there you either have to travel back to old levels or having to optimize your character building like a scientific economist in order to gain the maximum outta your Adam.In BS2, even if you save all sisters, you got almost all the Adam you want and can experiment with Plasmids & Tonics and  still max out Health & Eve and all Plasmid and Tonic slots.- Elemental Cyclone traps as well as the Insect Swarm3 upgrade are nice features.- Rocket spear ammo looks really cool beside some other extra ammo.- Different Plasmid levels have actually more of a difference than just in damage rate.Another positive point (which is misleading in the screenshot section) is that the game doesn't really recycle too much: The only place in the single player mission is Fontaine's HQ as a sort of connection but besides you got all new areas of Rapture which fit in but are still different to the ones seen in BS1.Splicer characters are pretty much recycled, a little more mutated though. They seem ""fresher"" as well as the Spider splicers have now a distinctive design, not to mix them up with the others.Negative:The gameplay is still -but a lot less- repetitive. There are no side quests except from gathering Adam as well as the gameplay is very unimaginative: Go here, press button X, research y, harvest or save little sisters (how original!) and collect Adam of course.As well, it kept some flaws from the old BS1: The boss fights are really dull and the ending or final level is even more boring than in BS1 which wants you stop half way thru the Inner Persephonis. Actually I found myself preparing for a boss fight and collecting all special ammo, once I realized that the game is already over. ;)There are highs, like the Fontaine and Outer Persephonis level which are exemplary for the great BS cynicism and surreal atmosphere, but there are also extremely dull levels, namely the Siren Alley one: Maybe owed to American prudery, but the Mall area turned red light district would be rated ""Parental Guided"" w/o age limit because there is nothing except for the names of the places that would make you feel like being in one. Rather a BS Infinite Columbia type of styling with the dullest sub-missions next to the last level. Again, Ice and Insect Swarm are just killer Plasmids which make most boss fights a piece of cake apart from all the other Plasmids which do the gameplay for the player. Especially Hypnotize and the last Plasmid given.I played it on an elder system under a 32-Bit XP, but still think graphics are probably only marginally better than in BS1. I had no problems installing like some Win7 users were reporting. Besides 2 medium bugs I encountered, it ran smoothly.Bugs were the disappareance of Natural Camouflage ability after picking up a certain Tonic in the last level and even more annoying, the fact that scripted events were triggered by opening doors instead of approaching certain points, which led often to action starting and bosses chasing after you, before you even entered the area (""Cathedral"" in Siren Alley for example).Neutral:- caters a bit to the survival horror community, since it came out at the hype of those games; namely at the end of the Pauper's Drop level (nice though) and by protecting the Little Sisters against waves of enemies. But there is more to the gameplay.- the old waterpipe  logic & reaction hacking game has been replaced by a pure reaction game which doesn't stop the gameplay (personally, preferred the old one). But I must admit it makes the game more ""realistic"".All in all worth it, if you liked BS1 and not that far away from it by quality or even superior if you only count the gameplay. The latter is better but obviously a slightly lamer story. Nonetheless, as well developed characters as in BS1 (I expected more of a twist with Sinclair though). Update - Minervas Den:BS in a microcosm: Story with a twist to it. Besides more of the same.The laser weapon is not worth the addition. And since I hardly chase Houdinis with Winter Blast, the Wintery Houdini doesn't make much of a difference but at least adds. The fiery Brute Splicer is even less noteworthy. The tributes to famous computer engineers are sort of cheapish; I prefer the cats of BS2 ;). Design is again lovely, but nothing mindblowing new. And believe it or not: A hint of side quests with the vacuum bots and even the first puzzle since the series started: You have to press a button to remove a hook which blocks your way - wow!!! ;PPositive is also the way they integrated Plasmids and upgrades into the short game.Though I got the upgraded Spear Gun before the regular and the new Gravity Plasimd is forgettable: Stage 2 and 3 are just another trap and stage 1 is a ""heavier"" version of the Telekinesis trap with enhanced optics.

												So, you know that BioShock game, right? How it had a really good story, with neat plottwists, neat underwater world inspired heavily by Art Deco, and lackluster gameplay?You can't say anything about BioShock 2 without comparing it to the first one. BioShock 2 was an improvement in gameplay, that's for sure. Plasmid in one hand, gun in the other made a fine combination and killing was finally... well, fun. Gene Tonics added another layer of depth, even though at the end you can easily buy all the slots and fill them with the best tonics. Also, you get to be a Big Daddy, finally. After playing the first one, almost every player had this thought, how nice would be to play as one. So you get a drill and a rivet gun. Didn't change much in gameplay, but is neat.Can't forget about hacking though. First game had this water flowing in pipes minigame, thought it was nice, and a bit of a challenge. In the second game, they possibly decided it was too hard for consoles and replaced it with ""click at the right moment"" minigame. Pathetic. Boring. Click, click, click. Auto-hack darts help with that a bit, but still it left me with a bad taste in my mouth.Enemies. The main issue I had with the first game is in here too - splicers are supposed to have some personality, with small talk in some moments of the game, but they are still mindless and not challenging at all, just bullet sponges. Their quantity doesn't help with it - in my opinion, in such a game killing a person should make you feel bad at least a bit. I guess making them smarter and use elaborate tactics was too hard, so they just blamed splicing for messing with their heads.And the last thing - story. We all know it's weak. Has some problems. Disappearing (Tenenbaum?) and appearing for no reason characters make little sense. Main enemy is a woman that somehow gained followers that holds a teenage girl hostage. Her motivations are unclear, just like her modus operandi. Somehow she knows all and does nothing else, but monitors my movements. Sends me propaganda messages that are sure not to work. There's no plottwist or anything to make it better. Smaller bosses stories were much better. Grace had a solid story, Stanley did some weird stuff (but still better than Lamb), and Alexander had the best level. So, the story was far worse than in the first game. Good thing to note.But you know what? Story was definitely fixed in Minerva's Den. This DLC makes the entire game worth it, even though you have to play through the entire basic game to undersand it all. I know, it has backtracking, and hacking/enemies issues weren't resolved, but it's good even then.Even without the free DLC, I would recommend the game. It's not perfect, has some flaws, but you can't say it's bad or mediocre either.			"

												I couldn't believe how hard I was after the ending.For a Video Game Dad Simulator, this is pretty fun. There's a shark, a cartoon scientist villain, and more!Varies up the gameplay immensely from the first by giving you a Big Daddy's arsenal instead of the Genericsville gun roster you had in the first game. Plot is leaps and bounds better than the first game, dropping stuff like The Big Dumb Twist in favor of greater insight into the culture of Rapture and it's characters. Graphics do their part to show you more of the ocean aspect of Rapture, more interesting skyboxes and varied viewpoints than the first game.This game has good DLC, Protector Trials are fun and let you master the various combat options you may not have considered going through the game the first time, and completing them offers you an extra method of difficulty for Minerva's Den. Minerva's Den has decent length and difficulty, has a good story, and is not in any way shape or form like Burial at Sea (please do not buy Burial at Sea it is garbage I feel genuinely bad for the poor suckers who got punked 30 dollars by buying those)			"

												The Bioshock series is prob the best thing that has happened to gaming in the last years, refreshing gameplay, sick atmosphere, nice soundtrack, STELLAR sound design & voice acting. Can just chime in with the praise on all of the above - my only complaint: if there is one thing I abolutely HATE it's when games just start throwing enemies en masse at you in the last chapter, and Bioshock 2 kinda does this... a more streamlined ending would have been better IMHO - would have made me appreciate the storyline much more (which is awesome too). Sick game overall, makes me want to play the DLC and after that Infinte			"

												I've yet to start playing/finish Bioshock: Infinite, but this may give me better judgement.I found Bioshock 2 to be even better than Bioshock 1. I do not know why, but I am not downgrading Bioshock 1. They are both equally amazing and cannot be purchased singularly without the other. One must also play Bioshock 1 FIRST in order to experience everything correctly.It's been a while since I last played it, but I am writing this review right now because I feel it deserves one. I played the fatherly daddy side of the story, rescuing each and every little sister. Multiple pathways and endings through the story mean easy replayability, and it does that well. I also appreciate how you have the choice of killing a character in the plot or not, directing the pathway in the way you wish, and giving that wonderous illusion of choice that many of us crave in a mostly linear game.The combat and entire ""get little sister and get moar adam"" can become repetitive, but that is only what I feel. Out of the weapons, each one can have an equal chance at being used as a main weapon, switching every once in a while for lack of ammo or to deal with a specific enemy, if that is your style of fighting--choosing a single weapon to specialize in or just swapping back and forth from time to time. I like the upgrading system; each upgrade is farily visible once you put it into use, and I never felt dissatisfaction at the upgrade I chose to fit my style of combat. The customizability makes this game very flexible for a large audience. I played on easy difficulty, though, as I do not own the most beefy computer.One thing I particularly liked about the game was the Big Sisters. I like how few times they are encountered, which keeps their appearance and deadliness fresh. Though one point became a bit boring, it was probably just my fault. I absolutely love the noises she makes before she appears, too.The music and atmostphere is quite attractive. I may even say slightly better if not noticeably better than the first Bioshock game.In conclusion, it IS worth the money, but don't be stupid. One has to play these games in order... BioShock, BioShock 2, and finally BioShock: Infinite, if one wishes to. Maybe the Burial At Sea DLC after that, if you want. The Life-Electrifying universe is pretty interesting and fun. If you ever plan to play the first two BioShock games, make sure to do so. If you do not, feel free to play Infinite as it is.			"

												This series has one of the best settings for a game I've ever encountered, unfortunately let down by the gameplay itself.  This is a game so obsessed with feeding you its story that death literally has no consequence.The first Bioshock left a bigger impression on me - play that if you're new to the series.  This one fills in a few details about Rapture story-wise, but falls flat in most other respects.It should be noted that if (like me) you bought a retail copy of the game, it's worth registering on steam to gain free access to the Minerva's Den DLC, as well as enjoying a non-GFWL experience.Also, for your sanity, run the game with the ""-dx9"" flag set (right-click on game in library > set launch options), or you will probably experience constant crashes to desktop, especially so in the DLC.

												Update: Minervas Den added!Bioshock (BS1) was probably the best story a video game ever had and really understood the communication medium in storytelling: You just felt sooo angry after all got revealed and the audiotapes next to corpses left a morbid atmosphere of some long faded glory.[The meta stories connect well between all 3 parts. In BS1 there was the capitalistic or self-inherent threat to an atheist society, wheras BS2 is the religious-collectivistic danger to Rapture's ideals and finally BS Infinite is a Newborn Christian xenophobic ""W"" Bush type of state.]But and this was a major ""but"", the gameplay was more or less in a better beta state.Subject Delta, in BS2 on the contrary, experiences a still immersive story and a far more balanced gameplay than in BS1. In Detail:First of all, the Bioshock series ain't RPG but is rather an FPS with strong RPG elements, which includes character building and players' actions which decide the outcome or rather just the cinematic ending, I should say (apart from minor support by characters you kept alive). The level design is in both BS 1 & 2 linear and not open world. BS2 is more tubular than the rather circular maps in BS1, but to the benefit of cutting down on long lonely corridor walks w/o any noteworthy action.Positive compared to BS1:The gameplay is a lot better balanced, due to the fact that: - The one-hit-BigDaddy-killer weapon grenade launcher is given as the last weapon unlike BS1.- The AI doesn't jump like mad onto you as in BS1, but even Houdinis and Spider Splicers act ""normal"" and walk around.- There are no more Nitro (and after half way into the game) no more Thuggish Splicers but all Splicers have a melee and Nitro ability and thus become more versatile in their attack patterns; as well as you got melee abilities with every weapon.- Double wielding Plasmids and weapons eliminates the need of switching permanently during combat- The old research cam system, which dragged the game endlessly, used to be the biggest pain in the a... This got now completely revamped, making it much leaner and faster with less categories, less research levels and a video camera system which rolls in the background rather than draining your patience and health during a fight. Just don't forget to turn on, since the best goodies are now at the highest research level! - There are a lot of good new enemies, like new Big Daddies and one new Splicer type, which add well.- due to the tubular level design, the gameplay is far more intense.- The marketing department finally realized that just by making the main character building resource scarce, it doesn't help replayability. Basically Adam was ridiculously scarce in BS1 with an economic system, there you either have to travel back to old levels or having to optimize your character building like a scientific economist in order to gain the maximum outta your Adam.In BS2, even if you save all sisters, you got almost all the Adam you want and can experiment with Plasmids & Tonics and  still max out Health & Eve and all Plasmid and Tonic slots.- Elemental Cyclone traps as well as the Insect Swarm3 upgrade are nice features.- Rocket spear ammo looks really cool beside some other extra ammo.- Different Plasmid levels have actually more of a difference than just in damage rate.Another positive point (which is misleading in the screenshot section) is that the game doesn't really recycle too much: The only place in the single player mission is Fontaine's HQ as a sort of connection but besides you got all new areas of Rapture which fit in but are still different to the ones seen in BS1.Splicer characters are pretty much recycled, a little more mutated though. They seem ""fresher"" as well as the Spider splicers have now a distinctive design, not to mix them up with the others.Negative:The gameplay is still -but a lot less- repetitive. There are no side quests except from gathering Adam as well as the gameplay is very unimaginative: Go here, press button X, research y, harvest or save little sisters (how original!) and collect Adam of course.As well, it kept some flaws from the old BS1: The boss fights are really dull and the ending or final level is even more boring than in BS1 which wants you stop half way thru the Inner Persephonis. Actually I found myself preparing for a boss fight and collecting all special ammo, once I realized that the game is already over. ;)There are highs, like the Fontaine and Outer Persephonis level which are exemplary for the great BS cynicism and surreal atmosphere, but there are also extremely dull levels, namely the Siren Alley one: Maybe owed to American prudery, but the Mall area turned red light district would be rated ""Parental Guided"" w/o age limit because there is nothing except for the names of the places that would make you feel like being in one. Rather a BS Infinite Columbia type of styling with the dullest sub-missions next to the last level. Again, Ice and Insect Swarm are just killer Plasmids which make most boss fights a piece of cake apart from all the other Plasmids which do the gameplay for the player. Especially Hypnotize and the last Plasmid given.I played it on an elder system under a 32-Bit XP, but still think graphics are probably only marginally better than in BS1. I had no problems installing like some Win7 users were reporting. Besides 2 medium bugs I encountered, it ran smoothly.Bugs were the disappareance of Natural Camouflage ability after picking up a certain Tonic in the last level and even more annoying, the fact that scripted events were triggered by opening doors instead of approaching certain points, which led often to action starting and bosses chasing after you, before you even entered the area (""Cathedral"" in Siren Alley for example).Neutral:- caters a bit to the survival horror community, since it came out at the hype of those games; namely at the end of the Pauper's Drop level (nice though) and by protecting the Little Sisters against waves of enemies. But there is more to the gameplay.- the old waterpipe  logic & reaction hacking game has been replaced by a pure reaction game which doesn't stop the gameplay (personally, preferred the old one). But I must admit it makes the game more ""realistic"".All in all worth it, if you liked BS1 and not that far away from it by quality or even superior if you only count the gameplay. The latter is better but obviously a slightly lamer story. Nonetheless, as well developed characters as in BS1 (I expected more of a twist with Sinclair though). Update - Minervas Den:BS in a microcosm: Story with a twist to it. Besides more of the same.The laser weapon is not worth the addition. And since I hardly chase Houdinis with Winter Blast, the Wintery Houdini doesn't make much of a difference but at least adds. The fiery Brute Splicer is even less noteworthy. The tributes to famous computer engineers are sort of cheapish; I prefer the cats of BS2 ;). Design is again lovely, but nothing mindblowing new. And believe it or not: A hint of side quests with the vacuum bots and even the first puzzle since the series started: You have to press a button to remove a hook which blocks your way - wow!!! ;PPositive is also the way they integrated Plasmids and upgrades into the short game.Though I got the upgraded Spear Gun before the regular and the new Gravity Plasimd is forgettable: Stage 2 and 3 are just another trap and stage 1 is a ""heavier"" version of the Telekinesis trap with enhanced optics.

												A much more vibrant and refined  game than the original, combat, and hacking is a lot more fluid and the evironment is much more detailed. The narrative is more set in stone but  i feel this helps the game convey its story much better than the original (barring the obvious plot 'choices'). Still a bit too easy so hard difficulity is again recommended.To most a step back compared to the original but with the release of Bioshock infinite i feel this title was unfairly judged and is atleast equal if not slightly better than Infinite due to having far less handholding and and far more interesting characters (barring infinites shocker ending i suppose).Rapture just makes for a much more engaging setting than minor alterations of New Columbia ever will be.Bonus ; The minerva's den dlc delivers another 4-5 hours of excellent (standalone) campaign.

												A sequel worthy of its precedessor.Bioshock 2 makes you jump right into the known an deep setting with familiar set of mechanics that went through slight alterations and refreshement; most noticeable with plasmids that suddenly became a much more interesting and versatile tool that doesn't force you to stop gunning. A change needed for the more action-y nature of the game when compared to the original Bioshock.While the gameplay feels very familiar, the storytelling isn't. The difference comes from the fact that the first game was all about introducing the player to Rapture and telling him the story of it. What was driving us all was the discovery, walking through the city that fell from its glory and plunged into darkness. That, and a very well constructed plot with just the right amount of surprises.You won't find that in the sequel - we know the place, we know the story. The plot got much simpler. What is it about, then? Feelings. Bioshock made you listen to the tale, yet stay a bit to the side. Bioshock 2, on the other hand, sacrifices some of it to make you feel and experience the Rapture as  Big Daddy. It's pulled off very well, and keeps the game on high level even if it is nto married to the same idea as the original. Gathering, protecting, curing, harvesting - it all feels more personal now. Same how it is for all the encounters with the 'main NPCs', which you can kill or spare. They all are relevant to who you play. You are not a 'stranger', but a part of the city. This aspect, and the general attitude of resorting to showing instead of telling gives this one a unique charm.			"

												**Please note** If you cannot get this to start opt OUT of steam beta updates. I wasted 4 hours messing around editing .ini files and all sorts of crazyness only to find that this was the source of the problem!  This time we take on the role of an Alpha series Big Daddy in a Rapture plagued with many of the same enemies we love (or hate) and a host of deadlier new foes. One of the first things that i noticed was that the difficulty seemed just a little harder, but that may have been due to my playing the game the same way I played the first. All guns and little use of my powers/plasmids. Bioshock 2 has lots of arguments for both pro's and con's. Personally I think at the time of release, people were so blown away with the original that the masses just expected too much of the second instalment. The missions feel more involved and (for me at least) less grinding forward and backward. The story adds far more depth to the Rapture ledged but also leaves just enough out to make you wonder what the hell REALLY happened here. Also the transitions between levels were far better planned out in this one. (*SPOILER*) --->  The outer ocean walking made for a nice break from the action with some beautiful animations and effects too. All in all I loved this game just as much as the original and would happily recommend it.  My Specs: i7 4770          16GB Ram                  GTX770 OC (4GB VRAM)Thanks for reading! :)			"

												Playing video games for the first time long after their release is not always a bad thing. Indeed it enables us to see how they endure the test of time. And only true jewels can stand it. What about Bioshock II ? As I had been blown away after playing the first opus, I expected a lot from this sequel. And so did many Bioshock fans. Here's my review :(See rating at the end of the review)____________________________GAMEPLAY: Quite similar to what we experienced in the first game. The gameplay is really focused on immersive and explosive fighting sequences. The difference with the first opus is that there's no real final boss but very often the player is opposing big waves of ennemies. Hopefully it is possible to prepare your defense by setting traps and mines, hacking security cameras and turrets. But if you want to collect all the Adam, these defensive fights become too repetitive. On a more positive note, some new weapons add more fun to the gameplay. I really enjoyed playing with the drill and the spear gun. Moreover, it's really interesting to combine different weapon's and plasmid's attacks. I liked the fact, that as a Big Daddy you really feel the strength and the weight of your character. There are also different levels of difficulty that you may choose depending on your experience in FPS games. So don't worry if you're not used to this type of game. I'm not, but I still truly enjoyed playing it.VISUALS, MUSIC & ATMOSPHERE: That's why so many people love the Bioshock saga : a deep immersion into an equally beautiful and horrific world. Of course, I already knew how Rapture looked like but I was still surprised by the beauty of the scenery. And even if the game engine is getting older, the esthetic of this chaotic city is still mind-blowing. The new developers have even got further with more cutscenes and submarine exploration that offers quiet and contemplative moments between the fighting sequences. I also have to praise the soundtrack, the voice-acting and the sound effects that are even better than in the first Bioshock.STORY: In this sequel, which occurs ten years after the events of the first game, we play in this sequel a reborn Big Daddy who's trying to get back to his little sister. Our quest offers us the possibility to explore many new places and to meet new cheracters. The most interesting ones are the utopist Sofia Lamb and the opportunist Sinclair who take the roles of Ryan and Atlas in the antagonist-protagonist pattern. Because we are more familiar with Rapture and it's doom, we are less surprised by the wickedness of its inhabitants but there are still some strong revelations. Many elements of the story are smartly scattered in the Audio Diaries that the player finds on its way. And as we move towards the end of the game, the story becomes more and more intense. To me, three of the four different endings are a bit overdramatic but they still have a great theatrical effect. LENGTH: It takes around 10 hours to finish the game. More than that if you don't use the quest arrow. There's four different endings that you can experience depending of your choices, but because the game is very scripted I wouldn't do it all over again. ____________________________  Gameplay 4.5/6   Visuals, music and atmosphere 6/6   Story 4/6   Length 2/2   - -   Global Rating 16.5/20 Even if we are familiar with Rapture, it is still a great pleasure to explore this submarine terrifying world. Bioshock II is not disappointing at all in terms of visual design and atmosphere. However, this sequel is bit more focused on action than on the story. As a result, the gameplay is more entertaining but the story lacks originality.			"

												If i`m going to speak the truth here. You can easily skip this game and play infinite without the feeling. 'Huh, I`m missing something.'I start with the good things. The gameplay is way faster than the orginal, you can equip both a plasmid and a gun at the same time. Combine this with the fact that you now can melee strike with the press of a button (instead that you have to select you wrench) and you have a faster bioshock game. New types of enemies are also introduced, including things called big sisters which are form a way bigger danger than a big daddy. And you, now being a big daddy, you can now adopted a little sister with fun defend sections where you can be really creative with combinations of plasmids and weapons.But as I now look at the things I liked about the game I can immediately give it a counter argument that works agains it.For example the new splicer, the brute splicer, showed in the beginning  but at the middle of the game never came back. And the new big sisters are with this exploit super easy, go stand next to a vending machine and keep shooting the b*tch until she dies becase ammo and cash are so insultingly common that I almost all the time get the message that I have the maximum of my money, medkits or eve hippos or ammo types it really frustrated me.Also the gunplay didn`t statisfy me, and same goes to the story of this game. It didn`t shock me like the twist of the original, that stuck to me to this day, same goes to the dread of the original. Bioshock 1 has peoplo who went complete crazy and, for example, stab now there clients in the guts and hang them on the wall because they are ugly. Bioshock 2 on the other hand has not only that dread of the original but also not the personality.And please, for Ken Levin`s sake, don`t play this game on a xbox controller. I did and the fact that I need to lift my tumb of the right stick to heal where my fingers got stuck with each other causes some cheap deads, and I couldn`t rebind the controls.But as I went on and on about how a piece of sh*t this game is. I still recommend this game, weird enough.You got to see how little sisters see the world and why they keep calling corpses ''angels'' and this is still one of the best shooters around and it wasn`t a torture to play. It`s just not as good as bioshock 1...			"

												Bioshock 2 is set after the original Bioshock game, the story is fantastic like the original and the mechanics of the game have been improved.In Bioshock 2 you play one of the first version of a big daddy, I feel this is well implemented and the story really works well with the first Bioshock and the actual book. Not as creepy or as scary as the first one which is a shame because I felt it really worked well for the first.The Expansion is good fun as well and so are the challenges which are included, the multilayer is great fun but I feel the internal networking mechanics are quite broken but when it does work it is enjoyable.On a whole i love this game and would recommend it to anyone who has played any of the Bioshocks, even if it is just for the story.

This is a long review so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend BioShock 2 skip to Results and read from there.2K Games does it again with a beautiful story, fantastic gameplay, and wonderful internal environment. BioShock 2 has it all and pushes the greatness of the series to new heights.Story:Taking place after the original life has been brought back to the lost, but never forgotten city of Rapture. Professor Lamb has started working to bring young girls back down to the deep city and start cultivating Adam once again. Her idea of a utopia exists unlike Ryan’s which is based on uncontrolled capitalism Lambs is based on true altruism, the idea of the true utopia. You as one of the original Big Daddy’s have been brought back to life to save Eleanor, your Little Sister from a fate worse than death. Will you be able to make it in time?Campaign:There are nine levels: Adonis Luxury Resort, Atlantic Express, Ryan Amusements, Pauper’s Drop, Siren Alley, Dionysus Park, Fontaine Futuristics, Outer Persephone, and Inner Persephone. The levels in this campaign vary in length drastically, some of them being relatively short while others are overly massive. You have varying objectives in each area: find items, fight bosses, activate switches, find little sisters, etc. These keep the campaign interesting and each area has its own spin on how it wants you to play. The campaign is well laid out and each area has its own twists that make it unique. Gameplay:The game plays differently than the original, as you are no longer a mere mortal but rather one of the machines you fought so hard to defeat. You wield all weapons single handedly allowing you to equip plasmids in your other hand. This way you can shoot a gun as well as light a foe on fire, personally I was so used to the first one I forgot half the time I could do this. When I finally realized I still found myself not using it as the menu interface to change between plasmids was not as dynamic. This games combat realistically was drastically improved; no longer did you need to keep pulling out the camera during battle to get the best shot, instead you just clicked and it recorded while you were in combat giving you a score for the battle. The remote hacking tool allows you to actually hack cameras, which you could do in the first one but was very tricky as they would almost always detect you before you started the hack. Plus the wrench was changed to a drill which had multiple attack types making it more dynamic. In BioShock I actually used the Wrench all game, so I decided to only use ranged weapons this time round. There are three key combat elements in this game: Weapons, Plasmids (like spells), and tonics (like buffs). The weapons, plasmids, and tonics really allow you to customize your play style. By choosing specific tonics in combination with weapon choose and plasmid choice you can decide if you want to be a melee master, a total hacker, or gunning madman. Plus each weapon, plasmid, and tonic has upgraded versions which make them even more effective and variable. Minerva’s Den:I wasn't sure about Minerva's Den, usually DLC campaigns are just extra levels and lose the elements that make a game great. Minerva's Den was the complete opposite, in fact this DLC story rivals that of the original. There are three levels: Minerva's Den, Operations, and The Thinker. The first two levels are exceptionally large and have many missions/puzzles invovled and the final level is a boss fight. This DLC adds an exceptional amount of depth including a new weapon (Ion Laser) a new Plamid (Gravity Well), two new tonics, and four new enemies. This is an amazing new campaign which offers a brilliant story and fantastic new elements to the BioShock series. Results:BioShock 2 is an amazing game; although, it doesn’t stand up to the story of the original it still provides an amazing play-through. The story itself is relatively well written, and in comparison to non-BioShock games is actually quite brilliant. The combat is fun and rather in-depth with each weapon having three ammo types including the melee tool gives a huge variety to your combat style. You can even customize your tonics and plasmids to enforce the type of gameplay you desire. BioShock really is the FPS for anyone looking for a great story, invigorating combat, epic boss battles, and cool puzzles. I would recommend this game at full price, but if you’re frugal like me and only buy games on sale then wait as anything below its normal price is a steal. Pros:+Fantastic story+Beautiful game environment+Loads of weapons, with different ammo types+Many plasmids (spells) to choose from with upgraded levels+Loads of tonics (passives) to equip which customize your gameplay experience+Three difficulty settings, for all levels of gamers to enjoy.+New dynamic to the BioShock series revealing the inner sanctum of the Big Daddy.+Offers DLC to extend the experience.Cons:-The game allows you to set the difficulty in the menu. I started the game on “Hard” and somehow it dropped to “Medium” at some point. I didn’t notice until a hint popped up about 1/3 the way through when I thought to myself how easy the game was. I bumped it up again to “Hard” and kept a check on it for the rest of the campaign, but this change resulted in my not being able to get the “Against All Odds” achievement. -The game would crash randomly for no reason, I did a verify integrity check but it said the game was fine. In turn I started saving every five minutes so I wouldn’t lose much if it crashed.			"

												Look, I love Bioshock, that much is clear.  This franchise awakens me to the dystopian genre, albeit very different universes, to  the Half Life franchise in a certain way.  It is, as you probably know, linear, and the story is clear and interesting.  Bioshock 2, although not visually stunning as Infinite, utilizes gameplay mechanic and storyline in a brilliant manner, and begrudgingly I admit this may be my favorite game of the entire franchise for both story and mechanics.  Quite brilliant game, given how cheaply you can acquire it.  Without reservation I recommend.			"

												Ah, yes, a return to Rapture is just what I needed before taking to the skies in Bioshock Infinite, and what an emotionally charged return to Rapture it is. Bioshock 2 took every gameplay and story element from it's predecessor, and improved them greatly. The new hack mechanic, the new dual plasmid and weapon combat, all combined with feeling like an unstoppable force in the suit of a big daddy make this an engrossing gameplay experience.The interactions with some of the characters, specifically the decisions whether or not to kill them, is engaging because you are instantly rewarded or penalized based on your decision. The father-daughter bond between you and Eleanor is one of the most important parts of the game; she is seriously a driving force, and is center-stage in a beautiful, unforgettable ending.			"

This is a long review so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend BioShock 2 skip to Results and read from there.2K Games does it again with a beautiful story, fantastic gameplay, and wonderful internal environment. BioShock 2 has it all and pushes the greatness of the series to new heights.Story:Taking place after the original life has been brought back to the lost, but never forgotten city of Rapture. Professor Lamb has started working to bring young girls back down to the deep city and start cultivating Adam once again. Her idea of a utopia exists unlike Ryan’s which is based on uncontrolled capitalism Lambs is based on true altruism, the idea of the true utopia.

												My favorite game out've the entire Bioshock series. The game's story is as solid as the first, and the gameplay mechanics have been further improved (such as the ability to dual wield a plasmid and a weapon all at once).Another great thing about Bioshock 2 is the fact that it has a multiplayer portion of the game which is equally as enthralling, something that Infinite lacked (disappointingly).In all honesty, I can be a bit biased about Bioshock games because they hold a special place in my heart. It's one of the only games I can replay the Single-Player portion over and over.All in all, for a combination of story, gameplay and the graphics for its time, i'd give the game a 9/10.			"

												Good Game, but there is no autosave. Make sure you are saving consistently (and rebind F12, otherwise you make constant screenshots). An autosave feature owuld be really good here, I had to redo a WHOLE LEVEL, because the game crashed right at the end, and when I checked back, I was back to the beginning of the level...VERY frustrating. But if you save FREQUENTLY (I really mean it), it's a good game. I didn't enjoy the first bioshock, but this one is really good imo.As far as the gameplay goes, it's really good, with lots of ways to mix and match armours and abilities. If you enjoyed the first, you'd definitely like this one, and if you didn't like the first, this one just seems much smoother and has a different take on things. You can't go wrong with the triple bundle, especially if you got it in a sale.			"

												The ""best""/least mediocre Bioshock game. I actually kinda liked this one.The story and themes try to copy Bioshock 1 but it kind of ends up being a blander copy in that regard. But screw that! It actually manages to be fun throughout the whole game (unlike Bioshock) and the story isn't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ multi-dimension quantum magic pretentious hipster drivel (unlike Infinite). Basically, you're one of the first Big Daddies, and part of Rapture's Splicers have turned, in the 8 years since the first game, into a ""Family"" led by Female Andrew Ryan with a different philosophy, aka, Sofia Lamb. Your daughter is being controlled by her to be the Ultimate Citizen, and you want to get her back, as a Big Daddy would. There are twice as much endings this time (I didn't check the differences between them because I can't be arsed to), and the difference between these, besides harvesting or rescuing Little SIsters, is that they also depend on certain characters that you save. Or not. Bascially, instead of having 1 choice, you have 4.Gunplay is sort of between Bioshock (mediocre) and Infinite (less mediocre), and though it is slightly more linear than Bioshock at times, it doesn't waste hours of your time with backtracking (hence the shorter gameplay time even though I explored through most nooks and crannies) and the guns are slightly more original than Infinite's: Instead of the WW1 weaponry, you have the Big Daddy's Rivet Gun, a sort of minigun instead of that ♥♥♥♥ Tommy Gun from BS1, a harpoon launcher, a one-handed shotgun and Bioshock1's grenade launcher. You can also dual-wield plasmids, and the upgrades for both plasmids and weaponry are also more original than the 2 other Bioshcok games. Compared to both Ken Levine's Bioshocks, the game also has a lot less full of HP-bloated bullet sponges (though it gets more offensive in this regard towards the last 2 or 3 levels).Bioshock's Little SIster gameplay of harvesting or rescuing Little Sisters after fighting disgustingly HP-bloated enemies turns into adopting or harvesting. If you adopt them (You're a Big Daddy in this game, forgot to mention that) You can reenact the worst level of the first game where you go around letting them harvest ADAM (the magical space-slug chemical that allows you to upgrade your magic powers aka Plasmids) while playing tower defense.You only have to do this once though (for tutorial purposes *sigh*) and in later times you can just send them to the nearest vent and rescue or harvest them. The Big Daddies are not bullet sponges anymore because you have more powerful weaponry (now, there are Brute Splicers for whatever reason, which take up the seat of annoying bullet sponge that charges at you.) To keep a certain amount of dificulty in harvesting/rescuing Little Sisters (even though all difficulty in the Bioshock games is fake because you can just respawn with almost zero cost near where you ""died""), at the end of the level, come Big Sisters to get the ADAM you got back. They are sort of a combination of Big Daddies (the charge at you) and Houdini and Spider Splicers (they jump around, and throw fireballs and whatever objects are in the vicinity, at you.) They are not complete bullet sponges, and are fairly fun to fight against.Overall, it's not really a great game, but it sure as hell is better than ♥♥♥♥ing Infinite. And the first game as well.			"

												TLDR: An enjoyable follow-up to the first game continues the story of Rapture with a new protagonist, a new conflicted (kind of) big boss and more gene splicing action. This time around you have some moral decision making to do, and your actions affect the game’s ending.If you’ve played the first Bioshock game, you’ll remember that in the mid 1900’s the world’s top minds secretly worked together to build the underwater city of Rapture, and created what they thought was the ultimate utopia, free of government and religion. Instead they were ruled by the free market and meritocracy, so everyone makes money based on being good at something. In Bioshock 2, you learn that the pressures of this “perfect world” started to get to the citizens (especially the poor), and a psychiatrist was brought in to help people deal with the stresses of pure competition. Unfortunately, the psychiatrist Sofia Lamb had her own agenda, and saw the opportunity to create a true Utopia in Rapture through the use of Adam. Adam is a genetic material that can be used to create “plasmids” for artificial evolution through gene splicing. It doesn’t just give people super powers though, apparently it can be used to transfer the memories of the users to certain prepared users (Little Sisters). Little Sisters are orphaned girls who have been kidnapped and turned into walking “Adam factories” who can later be harvested for their gooey Adam. The Little Sisters are guarded by Big Daddies, brainwashed people in armored diving gear who are psychically linked to their Little Sisters and guard them from any threat.In Bioshock 2, you play a Big Daddy, though the gameplay is nearly the same as in the first game (where you were a human). It’s still a First Person Shooter and the weapons are mostly the same as well. There’s been a refinement to the plasmid system where you’re basically dual wielding now (plasmid in one hand and gun in the other). In the first game you had to switch between gun and plasmid. A big change is that because you’re a Big Daddy, you do a bunch of mini escort missions where you guard Little Sisters as they gather their Adam. Just like in the first game, you have a huge variety of weapon ammo types and plasmid types to help you survive, though you might notice that the game is more difficult this time around. It seems like you take more damage in Bioshock 2 than in the first game.Pros:+The story is good though it’s a little difficult to figure out what the deal is with Sofia Lamb. How did she turn into such a ♥♥♥♥♥?+The game takes what is good about the first game and adds to it. I kind of liked the hacking mini game in the first game better though. There are more weapon types, more plasmids, and more enemies. The mini bosses in the first game were the Big Daddies, who are back, but now you have the Big Sisters to deal with as well and they’re twice as powerful. +The game has 6 different endings depending on the moral choices you make throughout, but they’re actually very close to each other. I’ve probably only seen 3 of them because I usually play games as a “good person” and had to go out of my way to make evil decisions. Cons:-People have told me that Bioshock 2 is the weakest in the Bioshock series and I can see their point. There really isn’t much more innovation and it’s kind of like a continuation of the first game in terms of technical improvement. Like with Saints Row 4, where people said it was almost a really long DLC for Saints Row 3.-There were some technical issues for me related to graphics. It seems to be a common occurrence based on what I found when googling for solutions. To keep the game from crashing, I had to change the display to Direct X 9.Overall, if you liked the first Bioshock, you’ll probably like Bioshock 2, though maybe not quite as much. The game takes about 10 hours to beat and is more than worth your time.  8.5/10 "

One that introduces fascinating new settings and characters, but doesn’t forget or neglect those previously established.

												I played this game on the 360 when it came out back in 2010. I blazed through it in one night, and revisited the multiplayer once or twice. As a result, I didn't remember much about it. I got into PC gaming a few months ago when I built my first rig, and have really enjoyed it. In the spirit of nostalgia, I bought the Bioshock double pack during an Amazon sale, curious how the games would look on my new machine. So, I embarked on a back-to-back Bioshock playthrough, and I wasn't disappointed. Though the first game is spectacular, and one of my favorites, I found that I enjoyed the sequel far more. I realize this is an unpopular opinion, but bear with me. The mechanics are far more refined and enjoyable compared to the original game. Allowing the player to wield weapons and plasmids simultaneously in particular really spices up the gameplay. All of the weapons are fun to use, notably the trap ammunition. I also felt that the story was much more engaging, and had me more invested than that of the first game. Though the 'WYK' twist is certainly one of the best moments in gaming, it is both the high point, and most memorable story element from the first game. In Bioshock 2, the narrative is woven in a much more consistent manner. Everything you do has purpose, driving you towards your end goal. I didn't get this same feeling in the first game - areas seemed strung together, giving it a more level-based feel.I could extoll the virtues of this game for many more paragraphs, but the only way to truly appreciate it is with first-hand experience. Don't be deterred by those who paint this game as the cash-in middle child of the franchise. Sure, it didn't inject the series with a bunch of new mechanics, but that's not what the development team set out to do. They did, however, deliver a solid game that is worthy to sit on the shelf (or desktop) beside its more well-received siblings.			"

TL;DRA continuation of a famous sci-fi FPS.+ Fascinating story+ Variety of tools of destruction (Spear Gun FTW!)+ Plasmids+ Atmosphere+ Graphics+ Soundtrack- Gathering ADAM gets old pretty quicklyREVIEWBioshock 2 is the sequel to the innovative sci-fi FPS. It continues the story of the underwater city of Rapture.Several years after the events of the first game, a prototype Big Daddy called Subject Delta is brought back to life in order to find and rescue Eleanor, a Little Sister whom he is bonded with, from the hands of the Rapture's new leader, Sofia Lamb. Sofia is a psychiatrist who believes that only by sacrificing our egos can we make the Earth a good place to live. That is a polar opposite of what Andrew Ryan stood for. Like in the predecessor, there are many voice recordings to be found. Moreover, the gloomy atmosphere of the desolated Rapture combined with the colourful water depths compliments the game perfectly.The gameplay has not changed much – the goal is to complete the given tasks and harvesting or rescuing Little Sisters. There are more enemies and they are a bit more challenging. Feminists have finally been heard and Now there is a female counterpart to the Big Daddies – the Big Mommas Sisters (as if the female leader was not enough...). Moreover, a new mechanic has been added – being a Big Daddy, the player can choose to ""adopt"" a Little Sister and make her gather ADAM from corpses. The procedure is similar to the good ol' King of the Hill mode – the player has to protect the child while she is harvesting the precious substance. However, it can get old pretty fast.Speaking of additions to the game, there are new weapons and plasmids. For instance, there is a spear gun which I have grown to love (probably more than I should...). In terms of new plasmids, Scout comes to mind. This power lets you deploy a ghost projection that can use plasmids or hack devices. Bioshock 2 supports a variety of playstyles which adds to the replay value. There also is a multiplayer mode.To conclude, Bioshock 2 is a worthy sequel to the original. The combination of the fascinating story, great graphics, and a variety of choices makes it a marvellous title. P.S.

												Another masterpiece The most appealing thing about Bioshock games is that they all unique and fresh. Nevertheless the game is developed by not Ken Levin's team, it's still nice and continues the story told in the first Bioshock succesfully without stupid cliches and unlogical plot twists. The game is very good, and this is proved by its replayability. Awesome! 10/10PS. Minerva's Den - not a bad arcade DLC.			"

												First of all i review franchises all together and i play their games 1 after another so i dont forget the entire thing.i recommend that u see my review of bioshock 1 first. i TRY to keep this short !Story : I have to say the story of bioshock 2 is solid (mostly) but nothing will ever have the originality of the first one...1st And Most Important to State is that the textures in bioshock 2 are actually HD so your eyes wont get tired if you play for long ours...Improvements : 1 - Hacking will not pause the game, so you are open to be attacked and its more realistic so its better & therefore u cant RUN and RUSH to a bot like in the first bioshock...But alternatively now you have a remote hacking gun wich make it less FUN !!You have more larger scaled maps and more open space wich makes combat more FUN !The Rest Of it is just BIOSHOCK ! ( no other changes )-----------now MINERVAS DEN DLC : i removed this part, now u can check the minervas dlc review seperately and instead i made the review about the game it self longer .-------------update : you have a couple of new tonics that give you more freedom than the first bioshock.Headshots actually count for something ! they didnt really in the first one.you have some headshot tonics which will help you too.The strongest weapon in bioshock 1 was actually the WRENCH itself, if you used all the right tonics.i give this game 8/10reviewed By IMMORTALEADER			"

												Belated review. Building upon the fantastic gameplay and setting introduced in the original game, Bioshock 2 does an admirable job of continuing the story. The main knock against this game is that it isn't as revolutionary as the original. We've already seen most of what it has to offer, so there are no major revelations here. That said, sometimes there isn't anything wrong with ""more of the same"", especially if that ""same"" is as engrossing and polished as this. Rapture is just as cool as ever, and the gameplay is just as fun. If you loved the original, there is no reason not to give Bioshock 2 a few hours of your time as well.			"

												Back to Rapture: this time you are the big guy with the drill and everything. In the first moments of the game you get that sensation of being the powerful guy that crush every splicer on his way but while you continue to walk in the submerged city you'l get more powerful adversaries.This time you don't have to face an ultracapitalist, and a socialist enemy but a religious one with her cult.The story is good, and the game is fine. There is only a thing that I don't like. Since this game is a console conversion all the ""mouse minigames"" of the original BioShock have been replaced with some skill-click game.			"

												Welcome back to Rapture! This was a fun play. For those who have played Bioshock, this is a no brainer. You need to get it. Here are some things to keep in mind. There is not a lot of new groundbreaking material, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. When the first game got so many elements right, this game just transferred those elements to this game. Atmosphere, combat, and finding upgrades and shinies are just as fun and interesting as the first game. Plus, you get to be a Big Daddy. Thats just awesome. The only slight downer is the story. It is not a bad story at all, but it does not contain the massive twist that the first game had. Instead, the reveal in this game just answers questions you may have had during the game. There are a variety of endings depending on how merciful or cold-hearted you are. I enjoyed my trip back to Rapture and I know I will be making a few more trips.			"

												Really underrated game. Story is OK, its nice to see how Rapture went and fall even more after the events of Bioshock 1. You get to know more about Little Sisters and Big Daddies, which personally think is very interesting. Plasmids are better than 1 but somehow I don't like them as a Big Daddy. I think it should be 100% daddy, more melee, more brutal, heavy weapons, the armor, etc. New weapons work perfectly but the plasmids... Its one of the things they couldn't take away from Bioshock1.Scenarios and maps are nice, again same as the first 1, city looks even more decadent, the places you look this tame are ""darker"" (like pediatry areas or a prison).Which is really interesting for me is how Infinity took a lot of stuff from this one. A LOT. Cultism, religious, the figure of a young girl as new messiah and savior, you (the player, the main character) as a devil who wants to break the community... Some places are the same, some DIALOGUES are even the same. I really don't know how infinity by being a good game took so many credit... and Bioshock, by being a good game is so underrated and forgotten.Play this gem			"

												Let's just start with looking back to first Bioshock which was by the way great gaming experience for me. Splendid idea of underwater city Rapture built with vision of free mind for artist/scientists and other types of creative people that might get limited by their surroundings in world, but not in Rapture.As all previous utopistic societies that went straight into hell - new genetic improvements so called plasmids enhances your physical/psychical abilities in cost of ruining your body and mind (as drugs). But as every addict - you want more... but supplies are limited, so you start thinking about taking some from the others. In Rapture there were two major fractions - people listening to Andrew Ryan (man who built this ""paradise"") and Frank Fontaine(Ryans rival). After civil war, city was in ruins and people who survived this became weak-minded mutants (splicers) demanding ADAM (genetic material for plasmids).In Bioshock 2 not much really changes from that - except city is more ruined and remaining splicers are uglier and desperate more than ever. Story of Bioshock 2 happens many years after first Bioshock. Power vacuum was filled with new visionary - Sophia Lamb.You play as Big Daddy (subject Delta) whom was taken a little sister (Eleanor) years ago. You wake up revived by vita chamber years after death. And because you are genetically bounded with your little sister, you must find it or you'll die.Your journey begins here...I must say I enjoyed discovering new locations, newly refined plasmids, improved combat system (now you can hold plasmid and gun simultanously) and mainly fact being a big daddy, that giant monster in metal diving suit wearing drill, rivet gun and all...Unlike first Bioshock, this one experiments with multiplayer and I must say it ended half-way to success. It have same atmosphere as Bioshock 1, game modes are fun, gameplay is challenging and entertaining same time, you have a lot of singleplayer elements here (hacking turrets, vending machines etc.), but lack of dedicated servers is biggest problem here and no matter how good gameplay you can offer, absention of dedicated erver bound with horribly coded network code ruins everything.And I don't even mention GFWL and so called ""DLCs"" with overpowered third gun upgrades, new maps that you could play only if everyone owned that DLC (almost imposible) - I had to struggle with that until I stopped play it from frustration. Finally after some time GFWL closed (hurray for that) Bioshock was moved to Steam platform with all multiplayer expansions for free to all! So I could finally play some nice multiplayer... until people stopped play it so much, well at least I had some quality games before that.It's a must have for every Bioshock 1 fan, but I would recomment it for people who likes interesting FPS shooters with some STORY (not pointing at any bad-story games (lies... lies..))One of the best games I ever played and that is a truth.

												This is a title that I really feel conflicted about and wish that there was a neutral vote instead of just positive or negative.If you played the first Bioshock, you will like this game.  It improves on the first game with a fresh story in which you play as a Big Daddy.  More weapons, more plasmids, more enemies help with this title.My biggest compliant is that the PC port is bugged and crashes too much.  Save files easily are corrupted and render this game unplayable to finish.  The bugs will even happen during Minerva's Den which is a nice DLC IF it works.Some people have gotten lucky with the fixes explained in the forum while others have not had the same luck.  For the simple reason that 2K games refuses to fix this game properly, I cannot give a thumbs up.If the game works for you and you can get it to run in DX 11, this is a great game that mixes FPS and RPG elements with a twisted story.

												7.8/10The story was detailed enough to peak your interest, but the overall linearity of going from trainstop to trainstop do the task and move on was relatively dull. However the tasks did prove fruitful and the satisfaction of getting stronger; finding new tonics/ plasmids was worth the exploration. Players who are new to Bioshock or fps in general, could find the game somewhat challenging due to the lack of knowledge in when to use your heals/eves. Or perhaps that they are fairly scare. The conservation of ammuntiton is important, which correlates to your accuracy, as the more you use the less you would have for other possibly difficult opponents-obviously. In essence the gameplay is enjoyable and allows you to follow the character with some empathy, the change in perspective during the game does ease the normal steampunk environment which can be refreshing. What was lacking was the depth in the story and environment as it wasn't impactful enough and with no clarity in freedom leaves the players to just move forward.			"

   Underwater Fun and Fighting   After completing BioShock 2 and the Minervas Den DLC I think I can now give an unbiased review of both.BioShock 2 was a delightful journey through Rapture, following the events of the 1st in the series. and taking a new twist on the main protaganist and their motivations.There was a steady learning curve, allowing you to build a unique set of skills that include weapons, Plasmids (powers) and perks.  The weapons were varied and the upgrades made a serious change to the basic weapon - the shotgun being suprisingly meaty as it became upgraded.The Plasmids provide enough for whatever playstyle you prefer; ranging from telekenisis to freezing the baddies in their tracks.The addition of the other perks, meant that hacking and use of the drill in more 'intimate' fights, became as important as each other.As always the story develops over several characters, providing a few twists and turns I didn't expect, and it's the 'life' in each charater that serioulsy influences some of the choices that come on offer.  You can be mad, bad and a nasty piece of work, or make alternative choices and be rewarded for your human nature side.I took about 23 hours but did choose to explore and go looking in every nook and cranny (very recommended), but the dying was never so frustrating you wanted to stop.  Some fights lead to several deaths, but a quick swap of tactics and you're out there in the fray again.Minerva's Den is a decent sized DLC (8 hours?) that tells a completly new story, with no mention of the main game.  This allows the writers to put in different characters and make it a ""BioSHock 2 Light"", with none of the research side of the main game (it's assumed that you know what Houdini Splicer is etc. but the rules are to just kill whatever is shooting at you, so little knowledge of the baddies is really needed).  You will get many hours of fun and get into some real scrapes along the way.Graphics are pretty good on a decent system that can throw the polygons around, the water effects (as you'd expect) are superb, as are the particle and smoke effects.The sound is amazing and really embeds the player into a post-war environment.All in all a sound 9/10.

												Bioshock 2 is usually considered the weakest of the Bioshock games, but I disagree. Granted, there's not a lot of difference between this game and the first one, but I liked the first game enough that more of the same is a good idea to me. On the down side, it is a little buggy and about 80% of the way through, the adam gathering got bugged (no splicers would show up) and any save after that was bugged, so I had to play the remaining 20% without saving. The DLC also crashed more than I would have liked.			"

												Absolutely fabulous game, just like bioshock originall.If you want more of the same, just a little bit updated and such, then buy it!Pro's:1. Looks better then the original, and looks good even when playing in 2015.2. Gameplay is nothing special, but it is good, plus fun ways to kill with weird weapons and plasmids (just like in the original). 3. Story didn't really grab my full attention, but that could've been because I literally completed my first run of bioshock original the day before I played and completed this one, but it's still a good story I think.4. Game will guild trip you depending on moral choices.5. multiplayer I think? I have no idea I haven't touched it, and honestly forgot to look at it. Still better then not having one at all though! right guys?Cons:1. While better looking then the original, it still doesn't look like infinite. (captain obvious).2. Ragdoll animations still look like they are running on a lower framerate then the rest of the game just like in the original.3. story not as gripping as the original.4. The game copied many plasmids (for example) from bioshock 1.5. The game froze 2 times for me during my playthrough, I had to edit some launch thing into -dx9 or something like that (it's on all forums) and then I never had a problem again.6.!!!!!!!!SORT OF SPOILER!!!!!!IN THIS LINE OF TEXT ONLY: The end battle felt, just like bioshock 1 way too easy and dissapointing to me even when playing on the highest diffeculty.Conclusion:If you played bioshock 1 and loved it like me, then buy this and play some more!I think the bioshock series is awesome, this part is awesome as well, but more of the same awesome as part 1.It took me 13 hours to complete this, it didn't get boring for me and I completed it in 1 day.

												i love the bioshock series. theyre great. they are really, really great. but there is one problem that i had with bioshock 2; on windows 8 it will randomly crash. Now i say randomly, but it only crashed in the very beginning and the end for me. however, i have seen it crash for other people. there are 2 solutions for this; 1 is to save very, very often. this is obvious, but if you save often the odds of you losing a lot of progress are minimized. 2 is to follow Denis's guide;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=210917941if you dont want to leave steam, this is what i did; right click bioshock 2 and click on properties, go to ""set launch options"", add ""-dx9"", and the game should work. the only downside is that the graphics get a serious downgrade. if you do route 2, i suggest doing it BEFORE you start the game so you wont notice the difference. i did it at the second to last area and it was really obvious the graphics became worse. i dont even know how to undo the ""-dx9"" stuff, so it might be permanent. (of course you could try uninstalling and re-installing.) Still, despite the crashes, Bioshock 2 is a gret game and i recommend it. 10/10.			"

												This game improved a lot of things from the original Bioshock. Hacking is much better, most of the changes to your weaponry I think were for the better and the best one is being able to a plasmid and a gun at the time. I also enjoy guarding a little sister as she gathers adam. Using all sorts of weapons to lay traps is a lot of fun. The story does have a smaller focus but the audio logs give a bit more backstory to things.People may prefer the first one but I still think this game is very much worth playing. Lots of fun.I did have some problems with the game early on with it crashing after a few hours of playing but I had an easier making it work than I did with the original bioshock			"

												Every time I kill a little girls father I become the new one... should I try that on other occasions?Seriously I did not expect that. Bioshock 1 was a good game, but this one tops it easily. The story is far more deep and finally not everyone is your enemy, finally you can meet people here.There are game changing decisions and multiple endings waiting to be tried out, packed in quite challenging action with always too little ammunition. On the downside I had multiple crashes. The game just stopped and autosaves are only done once a level, which means you might have to play about 40 minutes again. The Quicksave button is misplaced on F12, since this does Screenshots in Steam.Another, minor, downer was the strange behavior of the plasmid order. The newest, and therefore mostly strongest one, always moves to the last slot, so you have to manually swap every single other slot at a gene bank.But asides from that, great story, great action und a really good atmosphere, which let me finish the game in two sittings.Total playtime in ""normal"": about 7 hours.

												I bought this in a bundle so I could play all Bioshocks in order.  After finishing the first one about half-way through, I got a new computer and it decided that it didn't want to work properly after that.  (Sound issues, CTD randomly, not saving games, etc. and that was if I actually got it to run without black screening during the load.)Decided to watch some summary videos so I didn't miss out on the storyline.  Started playing this, and comparing the few hours I've put into 2 to the hours I put into 1, I love this one better?  I think storyline wise, I like 1, but I'm not finished with 2 so that's a premature judgement.  I think I love 2 more because you interact with the little sisters a lot more than you did in the first one.  My opinion might change once the game is over and I might love the story better in this, but I'm just basing it off what I've played so far.			"

												Most things from BioShock apply to BioShock 2, so I'll do the rundown on changes.2 Quick discalimers:1-It crashes, a lot, and seemingly for no reason. It doesn't autosave as much as I wanted it to, so save often!2-The scarier moments from BioShock are pretty much gone (make of that what you will), so if you're not a horror fan, you'll probably enjoy this a bit more than BioShock, but it's still pretty bloody.So you're a Big Daddy by the name of 'Subject Delta', but you can still use Plasmids and such, because your a prototype. Your little sister, now a grown-up sister, needs your help after you get ressurected. The story is above average, but overall weaker than BioShock. Similar progression to BioShock as well, semi-linear missions but plenty of exploring for cakes and ammo. We've also got some new characters to go with our new areas too. Another change I like is the visual style. Set 8 years after BioShock, Rapture's leak problem has got a little...bigger...to say the least. The art deco style has been preserved, but there's odd glowing underwater plants and stuff, and the sequences where you get to wander around on the ocean floor are really beautiful. I spent the first 10-ish minutes going 'Whoa, everything's so pretty!'.Gameplay is largely the same, except now we can dual wield Plasmids and Weapons, a much needed improvement, and a full new host of weapons as well. Plasmids are largely the same, but some changes and additions, usual sequel things. I also found I was using a greater variety of weapons and Plasmids than BioShock, where I was often just using Electro-Bolt and the Machine Gun, Gene tonics are more streamlined, so you only have 1 HUGE set of Gene Tonics, which is rather nice as in BioShock, I was often thinking 'gawd, I need more combat tonic slots!'. Hacking isn't total ♥♥♥♥ anymore, just a kinda Quicktime event, but you can still screw up, and you can also hack from a distance, hooray! Enemies are largely the same, two new types of Big Daddy and one new Splicer is all I've seen so far. So pretty solid all round, nothing too different from the original, but some much needed changes.However, BioShock 2 does have a fair swathe of problems. The story isn't as good as before, which is a real weakness. The main antagonist has the most annoying voice ever, and she's always around, but the other characters are fine. As a Big Daddy, when you get to a Little Sister, you have two options: 1-'Adopt' her, take her to a corpse, gather some ADAM as you munch through half your health and Ammo after fighting a butt-ton of Splicers, then do it again, and finally send her to a vent, and I don't think you even get rewards unlike BioShock. Or, 2-Kill her on the spot, 120 ADAM, bam, no fuss, lots of mess, but no uneccesary usage of Health kits.On the note of Health and EVE Hypos: You can only carry 5 of each, but First Aid Kits fully heal you. I found I was often low of health. And it annoys me how you can eat, drink and smoke through your steel diving helmet, unless Subject Delta can absorb nutrients through Osmosis or something.When you are dealing with Little Sisters, there's a chance it can summon a Big Sister, a kind of Mini-Boss. They're kind of annoying, but not a huge ♥♥♥♥ to deal, and you are given proper warning. But please, ONLY spawn one if we're being evil and harvesting them, NOT protecting them with our lives and finally freeing them from their torment.The other two problems are more technical. I found the Audio was very quiet, everything was quite distant most of the time, which is really annoying, especially when sound is so important. The other problem is buttons. Although being able to dual wield is nice, there's a lot of extra keys, and it can get a bit cluttered. Due to too many keys, there's no manual way to reload EVE, which is a real pain in the middle of a fight, so you have to zap yourself to 0, then reload, which is about as fast as the original.But overall, BioShock 2 is still solid. It's kind of like Portal and Portal 2. They're both good games, but BioShock is superior to BioShock 2. The story is less tight than before, and there's some dangling threads here and there. BioShock 2 also has the morality element present, but it's handled a lot better, a bit more grey. And I genuinelly felt sad with the ending I got.			"

												I had written a lengthy, verbose review for this game (before it was inexplicably lost), exploring the narrative genius of Irrational's Bioshock, and the monumental difficulty of crafting a sequel. Such a masterpiece was nearly impossible to follow up, but somehow, in some miraculous, ADAM-infused way, 2K Marin managed it. While the first game explored the downfall of objectivism, and the inner depravity of man, the sequel dives (literally) into the aftermath of the Randian utopia's fall, and the theocratic communism that replaces it. The viewpoints and goals of Bioshock 2's antagonist, Sofia Lamb, is diametrically opposed to those of Andrew Ryan (and Frank Fontaine), which lends this sequel a very different flavour. It remedies Bioshock's failings, however few, and improves upon one of the most versatile and satisfying gameplay systems ever concieved. Bioshock 2 is, truly, worth your time.			"

												I played Bioshock Infinite first (never played a shooter before), and I have to admit that I couldn't get very interested in the story because I just found out how fun it was to shoot everything and how beautiful everything looked. Then I started playing the first, and I wasn't caught by the story either (this is me, im not saying it's a bad game or anything like it). And then I started this one and at first I thought it was kind of boring because being a BD didn't seem as interesting, but as I kept going I really liked the story, and yes, the levels are kind of tedious and repetitive -missions- but the story developes to a point where I didn't know what kind of ending I was going to get and I loved that.Yes, mine also crashed and gave me some simple bugs as, enemies getting stuck or things like that, so I had to keep TWO SAVES and constantly save in case the game failed. this is my favorite bioshock... u guys made me cry			"

												I really enjoyed ""Bioshock,"" it really was one of the best games ever made. So naturally, that meant I was looking forward to playing this game. And I was not disappointed. ""Bioshock 2"" really does manage to keep the fun of it's predecessor, and giving a good story to follow. Though at times, it felt like it was lacking. But I still played through it, and I got a satisfactory enjoyment out of it. I bought this game with ""Bioshock"" and ""Bioshock Infinite"", so after completing the first game, I jumped right in to this one.  The story is very heart wrenching, with an interesting theme, and it expands upon it's setting, while still maintaining the spirit of the first game.We return to Rapture in this game, eight years after the first game ended. And it looks worse for the wear. Having played the first game, I really felt some of the awe was gone from wanting to explore. But I still found it fun to see other places in Rapture that weren't in the first game, and I really enjoyed the aesthetics, how much of a novelty this city is. The game uses the same graphics from the first game, but it still keeps the setting looking very nice, and I liked how it incorporated underwater areas, which are very gorgeous to go through. The gameplay is relatively unchanged from the first game. This helps maintain the learning curve the first game had, making it easy for first-time and returning players to get into the game. I still enjoyed using the Plasmids, they're really nice. But I liked how you no longer had to switch from weapons to plasmids, as Subject Delta (the player character) can use both at the same time, which is a definite improvement. I also liked how you no longer needed to divide tonics into categories, giving you one full selection. Like in the first game, you could make Subject Delta your own character with your choice of Plasmids and Tonics to suit your own gameplay style. I tended to focus on hacking more, since I hacked a lot of stuff in this game.But what I really liked was that you were playing as a Big Daddy, allowing you to get a sense of what it's like being one. Whenever you adopt Little Sisters, you can either harvest them or take them with you to gather more ADAM or take them to an air vent and free them. However, the Little Sister defense got really repetitive for me, and more of an annoyance over time, but I really wanted that extra ADAM for more Plasmids and Tonics.The plot wasn't as predictable as I expected, and the game really turned up the morality to make it more meaningful in the long run. It still keeps it straightforward and never overcomplicates it with too much plot, like the first game. It no longer revolves around saving or harvesting Little Sisters. You encounter certain characters who have a connection to Subject Delta, and you get the choice to either kill them or let them live. This really affects how the final act of the game takes place. I also liked Eleanor Lamb, and her connection to Subject Delta in contrast to her connection to Sofia Lamb, giving a great theme of parents going to extreme lengths for their child's welfare. I really hated Sofia and her stupid ideas, and this game suceeds in the same place of making an extremely unlikable antagonist, it makes you keep going.I liked how they changed the hacking minigame, but it's still annoying, as you have to pay very close attention to the needle when it hits the right spot. The enemy variety is unchanged, but with the addition of the Brutes and Big Sisters. Both of them were extremely annoying, even after I got better weapons, plasmids, and ammo. But the Big Sisters, they add more of a risk to saving/harvesting the Little Sisters, and they make you really duck for cover before you fight them, so they do have a bit of a scare factor. And again, USE THE CAMERA! You'll need the research.I overall liked this game. It delivered what it promised, the setting still holds up, the gameplay is still easy to learn, and the plot is still kept pretty simple, and the morality is expanded upon to make it more meaningful. I was disappointed that the game didn't really have much else to offer, but it's still a good time. I intend to play this game again soon.			"

												This game is totally bonkers. Kooky, wacky, and super fun. I went into this one not knowing anything about the Bioshock universe and what a great surprise this turned out to be. Bioshock 2 is unlike anything I was expecting. I dig it.A Howard Huges type industrialist decides it would be a great idea to build New York City deep in the ocean, post World War II. The seafloor city he creates is called Rapture. Over the years everyone who moves in ends up going nuts. The citizens find out a sea slug can be turned into underwater super-meth so they end up addicted as 1950s era zombie drug fiends wearing tuxedos and cocktail dresses. And they join a cult. It's kinda rad. Nobody is keeping up with any building repairs so the whole city is falling apart- and flooding. Rapture's underwater city scape is a nice mix of run down collapsing atomic age buildings and colorful exterior seafloor areas. It's got a nice atmosphere complete with a big band soundtrack and lots of corny fifties kitch that works really well in-game. It reminded me somewhat of Fallout 3 with regard to the black humor and goofy vintage advertisements all over the place. On a side note I'd recommend playing both Bioshock 2 and Fallout 3 back to back. They compliment each other well.In Bioshock 2 you are a weirdo deep sea construction worker with bad breath roaming around in a metal diving suit called 'Big Daddy'. You've got a decade old headache... the underwater bad guys punked you and ripped off your kid. So it's understandable why you are a hater and extra pi$$ed off. You also happen to have some serious telekinetic powers plus a gnarley drill you can gut people with. That's just for starters. Later on you'll pick up a rivet gun, an antique shotgun, a spear gun, and some other odd weapon doo-dads that will put the hurt on hipster brainwashed junkies. Your job is to wreck these jerks and reunite with your little sister. Easy beans, right?The game has a setup whereby you can choose what weapons you want to upgrade incrementally, but there are a limited amount of upgrades available on each level. So choose wisely. Another interesting dynamic is you can literally make the game more difficult on the fly by triggering more boss fights. Attack other Big Daddies as you encounter them to adopt their kid (little sister), or not. If you do whack 'em and snag their little sister you have another choice available to either rescue them or pimp 'em out and harvest the loot. Rescue them enough times and you trigger yet another boss fight. That's pretty cool because you can make the game more painful with more boss fights and get rewarded accordingly or make it easier and not have to brawl as much. It's entirely up to you how you want to play it. The benefit to taking the long hard road and making it tough is you get loot to upgrade your telekinetic powers. One of my favorites turned out to be Hypnotize. Roll into a room with a handful of junkies wandering around loose and Hypnotize them to start an entertaining prison brawl. You can kick back and snag the loot when it's all over.Due to a fair amount of complaints about the Bioshock 2 Remastered version not working well or at all because of a ton of bugs and glitches I decided to play the regular version on my system. The regular version of Bioshock 2 was super stable with no issues to report.			"

   Underwater Fun and Fighting   After completing BioShock 2 and the Minervas Den DLC I think I can now give an unbiased review of both.BioShock 2 was a delightful journey through Rapture, following the events of the 1st in the series. and taking a new twist on the main protaganist and their motivations.There was a steady learning curve, allowing you to build a unique set of skills that include weapons, Plasmids (powers) and perks.  The weapons were varied and the upgrades made a serious change to the basic weapon - the shotgun being suprisingly meaty as it became upgraded.The Plasmids provide enough for whatever playstyle you prefer; ranging from telekenisis to freezing the baddies in their tracks.The addition of the other perks, meant that hacking and use of the drill in more 'intimate' fights, became as important as each other.As always the story develops over several characters, providing a few twists and turns I didn't expect, and it's the 'life' in each charater that serioulsy influences some of the choices that come on offer.  You can be mad, bad and a nasty piece of work, or make alternative choices and be rewarded for your human nature side.I took about 23 hours but did choose to explore and go looking in every nook and cranny (very recommended), but the dying was never so frustrating you wanted to stop.  Some fights lead to several deaths, but a quick swap of tactics and you're out there in the fray again.Minerva's Den is a decent sized DLC (8 hours?) that tells a completly new story, with no mention of the main game.  This allows the writers to put in different characters and make it a ""BioSHock 2 Light"", with none of the research side of the main game (it's assumed that you know what Houdini Splicer is etc. but the rules are to just kill whatever is shooting at you, so little knowledge of the baddies is really needed).  You will get many hours of fun and get into some real scrapes along the way.Graphics are pretty good on a decent system that can throw the polygons around, the water effects (as you'd expect) are superb, as are the particle and smoke effects.The sound is amazing and really embeds the player into a post-war environment.All in all a sound 9/10.

												if i could play it, i would tell you about itEdit 2-4-15: While I can't launch it on the computer I have played this game before on my Xbox360 and let me tell you it is a blast. The story might not wrap you in as great as the first Bioshock did but it is managable. The combat it satisfying and the the game allows you to have both you gun and super power hand out at the same time. Seriously this game is worth it. *Some where...beyond the sea...some where waiting for me!*			"

												While not as good as the original Bioshock, Bioshock 2 offers much of the same gameplay and setting so it's still rather solid. Bioshock 2 really screams of being pointless sequel considering how well the original wrapped up and whilst the story in this is not awful, it's not as strong as it was in Bioshock. Gameplay as I said is much of the same except you can now dual wield plasmid and weapons, also you get to play as a Big Daddy which isn't really implimented into gameplay much consider you control and move the same as Jack in the first Bioshock. So get it if you just want more Bioshock but don't hold your breath for anything as good as the first game, it's solid but not amazing.			"

												This game is totally bonkers. Kooky, wacky, and super fun. I went into this one not knowing anything about the Bioshock universe and what a great surprise this turned out to be. Bioshock 2 is unlike anything I was expecting. I dig it.A Howard Huges type industrialist decides it would be a great idea to build New York City deep in the ocean, post World War II. The seafloor city he creates is called Rapture. Over the years everyone who moves in ends up going nuts. The citizens find out a sea slug can be turned into underwater super-meth so they end up addicted as 1950s era zombie drug fiends wearing tuxedos and cocktail dresses. And they join a cult. It's kinda rad. Nobody is keeping up with any building repairs so the whole city is falling apart- and flooding. Rapture's underwater city scape is a nice mix of run down collapsing atomic age buildings and colorful exterior seafloor areas. It's got a nice atmosphere complete with a big band soundtrack and lots of corny fifties kitch that works really well in-game. It reminded me somewhat of Fallout 3 with regard to the black humor and goofy vintage advertisements all over the place. On a side note I'd recommend playing both Bioshock 2 and Fallout 3 back to back. They compliment each other well.In Bioshock 2 you are a weirdo deep sea construction worker with bad breath roaming around in a metal diving suit called 'Big Daddy'. You've got a decade old headache... the underwater bad guys punked you and ripped off your kid. So it's understandable why you are a hater and extra pi$$ed off. You also happen to have some serious telekinetic powers plus a gnarley drill you can gut people with. That's just for starters. Later on you'll pick up a rivet gun, an antique shotgun, a spear gun, and some other odd weapon doo-dads that will put the hurt on hipster brainwashed junkies. Your job is to wreck these jerks and reunite with your little sister. Easy beans, right?The game has a setup whereby you can choose what weapons you want to upgrade incrementally, but there are a limited amount of upgrades available on each level. So choose wisely. Another interesting dynamic is you can literally make the game more difficult on the fly by triggering more boss fights. Attack other Big Daddies as you encounter them to adopt their kid (little sister), or not. If you do whack 'em and snag their little sister you have another choice available to either rescue them or pimp 'em out and harvest the loot. Rescue them enough times and you trigger yet another boss fight. That's pretty cool because you can make the game more painful with more boss fights and get rewarded accordingly or make it easier and not have to brawl as much. It's entirely up to you how you want to play it. The benefit to taking the long hard road and making it tough is you get loot to upgrade your telekinetic powers. One of my favorites turned out to be Hypnotize. Roll into a room with a handful of junkies wandering around loose and Hypnotize them to start an entertaining prison brawl. You can kick back and snag the loot when it's all over.Due to a fair amount of complaints about the Bioshock 2 Remastered version not working well or at all because of a ton of bugs and glitches I decided to play the regular version on my system. The regular version of Bioshock 2 was super stable with no issues to report.			"

												Please note:  I played the base game on Hard difficulty.  I have prior experience with first-person shooters and I spent a lot of time checking every nook and cranny for more loot.While its story isn't quite as good as the first Bioshock's, Bioshock 2 more than makes up for it with improved gunplay.  The weapons are only a little different from the original, but they feel a lot better.  Maybe it's because I got the tonic that increases your headshot damage and it made everything die really fast, I don't know.Nothing felt bullet spongey, the only things that had a lot of health were bosses or special enemies that you only see once in a while, and even those can be taken down easily with the right strategy.  The plasmids are all useful and fun, some of the gene tonics are really overpowered a one particular area (not in a way that breaks the game, in a way that's really fun), and the guns all have their own niche in taking down certain enemies.  I used the rivet gun (pistol) the most because it kills most enemies in one headshot (if you have a few upgrades) and the ammunition is plentiful, though I used all of the guns (except for the machine gun) a good deal as well.I found four types bugs/glitches in 20 hours of playing.  Two of them were game-breaking, and the other two were mildly annoying.  The first is constant crashing , if you could call that a bug.  The second is that once, when I started my game, it kept playing the boss fight music even though I had beaten the boss the day before.  Quicksaving and quickloading didn't fix it and neither did restarting my game.  I had to turn off the game's music until I got to the next area, and that's when it stopped.The third is that sometimes your left hand will disappear, and you won't be able to use plasmids.  Restarting the game doesn't fix it either.  The fourth is that sometimes when you take items from shelves, the rest of the items fall through the shelf and onto the floor.  Every once in a while they fall through the world and you won't be able to get them.To fix the crashing, right click Bioshock 2, click properties, click Launch Options, and type -dx9 into the box.  I went from crashing every five minutes to only crashing once in the next ~18 hours, and even then I was alt-tabbing a bunch and had a lot of programs open.The disappearing left hand bug usually happened when I used the Scout plasmid or changed to the Drill Specialist tonic, though some people have had it happen to them when they zoom in.  To fix it, just spam the Zoom/Aim in key, F1, and F2 a bunch.  If you have the drill specialist tonic and this happens, change that tonic to something else at a gene bank, spam the aforementioned keys a bunch, and then change it back.All in all, this is a great game and worth a buy if you played the previous game or like first-person shooters.  I advise that if you haven't played the original Bioshock to play that one first, the world and story will make a lot more sense if you do. P.S.  If you set someone on fire, a Little Sister will remark ""Look Daddy, he's dancing!"", and that's probably the cutest thing I've ever heard.   "

												I played Bioshock Infinite first (never played a shooter before), and I have to admit that I couldn't get very interested in the story because I just found out how fun it was to shoot everything and how beautiful everything looked. Then I started playing the first, and I wasn't caught by the story either (this is me, im not saying it's a bad game or anything like it). And then I started this one and at first I thought it was kind of boring because being a BD didn't seem as interesting, but as I kept going I really liked the story, and yes, the levels are kind of tedious and repetitive -missions- but the story developes to a point where I didn't know what kind of ending I was going to get and I loved that.Yes, mine also crashed and gave me some simple bugs as, enemies getting stuck or things like that, so I had to keep TWO SAVES and constantly save in case the game failed. this is my favorite bioshock... u guys made me cry			"

												Positive aspects:Since I played Bioshock Infinite , I started to get in love with this type of story and gameplay although it gets a little bit off from bioshock 2 and 1, you get a global idea from the franchise.Bioshock 2 gives you the possibility to play as a Big Daddy , with a new feature ( Plasma in one hand and the weapon on the right hand) it gives a new type of gameplay , with a lot of combinations to kill splicers and Big Sisters.In my opinion this game offers you a good storyline with 6 alternative endings that makes you think on your choices and how you play the game that brings other positive aspect to keep playing the game over and over..Bad aspect: I had a little trouble because of the crashes, it really annoys me that you have to constantly save your game because there's no auto saves..9.5/10			"

There are a few new weapons and plasmids, plus further exploration of Rapture's history. It feels more like an expansion of the first game, rather than a stand-alone title in its own right. There is also a multiplayer element added which I've never played.BioShock 2 is definitely enjoyable, but not quite as much as the first since the novelty has worn off.

The scavenging system was awesome, i used to play alot of mmo's so sometimes i found myself just wondering around collecting goodies. There are also tape recordings you can collect all over the city that tell small tales from rapture.The story is about a father trying to get his daughter back from her evil mother (Sofia lamb) who is the ruler of the underwater city you are all trapped on called Rupture. The people of the city see Sofia as some sort of prophet and try to stop you from getting your daughter back. You also have to fight through big daddys and little sisters who are experiments from the scientists of rupture and very difficult compared to the normal enemies, you have to constantly upgrade yourself to defeat them. The weapons are great, each weapon has 3 different ammo types you also have many traps you can set. Besides weapons you can purchase genetic upgrades which give a range of powers most essential to finishing the story. I bought this game as the trilogy and started off with number 2 as i thought number one was really old sometimes i dont like the graphics or mechanics ( i was wrong), as soon as i finished 2 i went back to the original bioshock i just needed to know how this story started and now i am hooked on the whole trilogy cant believe i missed these classics !!

												I really enjoyed ""Bioshock,"" it really was one of the best games ever made. So naturally, that meant I was looking forward to playing this game. And I was not disappointed. ""Bioshock 2"" really does manage to keep the fun of it's predecessor, and giving a good story to follow. Though at times, it felt like it was lacking. But I still played through it, and I got a satisfactory enjoyment out of it. I bought this game with ""Bioshock"" and ""Bioshock Infinite"", so after completing the first game, I jumped right in to this one.  The story is very heart wrenching, with an interesting theme, and it expands upon it's setting, while still maintaining the spirit of the first game.We return to Rapture in this game, eight years after the first game ended. And it looks worse for the wear. Having played the first game, I really felt some of the awe was gone from wanting to explore. But I still found it fun to see other places in Rapture that weren't in the first game, and I really enjoyed the aesthetics, how much of a novelty this city is. The game uses the same graphics from the first game, but it still keeps the setting looking very nice, and I liked how it incorporated underwater areas, which are very gorgeous to go through. The gameplay is relatively unchanged from the first game. This helps maintain the learning curve the first game had, making it easy for first-time and returning players to get into the game. I still enjoyed using the Plasmids, they're really nice. But I liked how you no longer had to switch from weapons to plasmids, as Subject Delta (the player character) can use both at the same time, which is a definite improvement. I also liked how you no longer needed to divide tonics into categories, giving you one full selection. Like in the first game, you could make Subject Delta your own character with your choice of Plasmids and Tonics to suit your own gameplay style. I tended to focus on hacking more, since I hacked a lot of stuff in this game.But what I really liked was that you were playing as a Big Daddy, allowing you to get a sense of what it's like being one. Whenever you adopt Little Sisters, you can either harvest them or take them with you to gather more ADAM or take them to an air vent and free them. However, the Little Sister defense got really repetitive for me, and more of an annoyance over time, but I really wanted that extra ADAM for more Plasmids and Tonics.The plot wasn't as predictable as I expected, and the game really turned up the morality to make it more meaningful in the long run. It still keeps it straightforward and never overcomplicates it with too much plot, like the first game. It no longer revolves around saving or harvesting Little Sisters. You encounter certain characters who have a connection to Subject Delta, and you get the choice to either kill them or let them live. This really affects how the final act of the game takes place. I also liked Eleanor Lamb, and her connection to Subject Delta in contrast to her connection to Sofia Lamb, giving a great theme of parents going to extreme lengths for their child's welfare. I really hated Sofia and her stupid ideas, and this game suceeds in the same place of making an extremely unlikable antagonist, it makes you keep going.I liked how they changed the hacking minigame, but it's still annoying, as you have to pay very close attention to the needle when it hits the right spot. The enemy variety is unchanged, but with the addition of the Brutes and Big Sisters. Both of them were extremely annoying, even after I got better weapons, plasmids, and ammo. But the Big Sisters, they add more of a risk to saving/harvesting the Little Sisters, and they make you really duck for cover before you fight them, so they do have a bit of a scare factor. And again, USE THE CAMERA! You'll need the research.I overall liked this game. It delivered what it promised, the setting still holds up, the gameplay is still easy to learn, and the plot is still kept pretty simple, and the morality is expanded upon to make it more meaningful. I was disappointed that the game didn't really have much else to offer, but it's still a good time. I intend to play this game again soon.			"

												""In 1968, the very first Big Daddy created by Andrew Ryan finds himself in a struggle for survival against the city of Rapture and its newest martyr, Sophia Lamb"".This game will make you use your brain cells to figure out all of the details hidden in its story. They once again present us one of the greatest stories in the gaming history.The improved gameplay makes the game much more intuitive. It feels like the game is shorter than the first one. But you have multiplayer to have fun with, too.I recommend you to buy the trilogy.8/10 "

												Before I go any futher I have played and beaten this game on the Xbox 360 many times.One of the first games to really grab my attention and focus for such a long time.I got this game on the PC due to the xbox 360 acting up at a time I wanted to play this game.Story and graphics are some of my favorites along with the concept of the game as well. I enjoyed escorting the little sisters and defending them.IMO this game was in some parts better than the first in the series and still holds up well against Bisoshock Infinite.Each had there good parts that I enjoyed and will continute to come back too.Note: I have played all the Bioshock games on console before gettig the few on PC.

												I enjoyed this game quite a lotReasons to play: The plasmids and gun duo was a smart and enjoyable idea.Since your playing as a big daddy over time begin to adore the little sisters making you want to protect them more than in Bioshock 1 When i was at the end of the game i still didn't have all of the plasmids and upgraded weapons making it possible to take your time and become op or to truck through the game guns blazingThe story was well written and was enjoyableBack tracking is a thing of the pastAbout a 6-8 hour gameplayNever got a single crashThere is a frank fontain easter eggSo in conclusion Bioshock 2 is a hard game to put down So would you kindly play it			"

												This game is a damn blast!!It's gorgeous, the music is fantastic just like its predecessor, battles are harder and at the same time, happen at a faster pace. Lamb is insanely irritating, but provides for a good villain that's actually hated.Gameplay mechanics have been improved over Bioshock 1, you get more gameplay from Little sisters, and Big sisters are a nice way to test your skills (PS: Either know the trick, or be a frequent Vita Chamber customer).It's simply extraordinary!

												I bought this in a bundle so I could play all Bioshocks in order.  After finishing the first one about half-way through, I got a new computer and it decided that it didn't want to work properly after that.  (Sound issues, CTD randomly, not saving games, etc. and that was if I actually got it to run without black screening during the load.)Decided to watch some summary videos so I didn't miss out on the storyline.  Started playing this, and comparing the few hours I've put into 2 to the hours I put into 1, I love this one better?  I think storyline wise, I like 1, but I'm not finished with 2 so that's a premature judgement.  I think I love 2 more because you interact with the little sisters a lot more than you did in the first one.  My opinion might change once the game is over and I might love the story better in this, but I'm just basing it off what I've played so far.			"

												i love the bioshock series. theyre great. they are really, really great. but there is one problem that i had with bioshock 2; on windows 8 it will randomly crash. Now i say randomly, but it only crashed in the very beginning and the end for me. however, i have seen it crash for other people. there are 2 solutions for this; 1 is to save very, very often. this is obvious, but if you save often the odds of you losing a lot of progress are minimized. 2 is to follow Denis's guide;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=210917941if you dont want to leave steam, this is what i did; right click bioshock 2 and click on properties, go to ""set launch options"", add ""-dx9"", and the game should work. the only downside is that the graphics get a serious downgrade. if you do route 2, i suggest doing it BEFORE you start the game so you wont notice the difference. i did it at the second to last area and it was really obvious the graphics became worse. i dont even know how to undo the ""-dx9"" stuff, so it might be permanent. (of course you could try uninstalling and re-installing.) Still, despite the crashes, Bioshock 2 is a gret game and i recommend it. 10/10.			"

												Bioshock 2 is usually considered the weakest of the Bioshock games, but I disagree. Granted, there's not a lot of difference between this game and the first one, but I liked the first game enough that more of the same is a good idea to me. On the down side, it is a little buggy and about 80% of the way through, the adam gathering got bugged (no splicers would show up) and any save after that was bugged, so I had to play the remaining 20% without saving. The DLC also crashed more than I would have liked.			"

												Take BioShock 1, cut the fat and tone down the preachy themes a bit, and you'd get BioShock 2.If that's not enough of a review for you, then I'll say that I enjoyed 2 much more than 1, despite 1 having a much better narrative and a bigger impact on me, in terms of FPS games. BioShock 2's gunplay feels incredibly liberating as you are no longer required to switch from weapons to plasmids - you have one in each hand at all times. BioShock 2 may feel like more of the same, but it's a great game that deserves to be played. BioShock 1 had a better storyline, but BioShock 2 is just more fun to play.Of course, when you factor in Minerva's Den, BioShock 2 is even more fun to play than BioShock 1. You should really play both to enjoy the story to the fullest in both games, however.			"

												Bioshock 2 is an older game now (nearly 4 years!) and has been reviewed many times; I'll repeat one thing that was common to a lot of those: If you liked Bioshock, you'll like Bioshock 2.  It doesn't have _quite_ as much impact as the former, largely due to the change of protagonist.  As Jack, even spliced up, you felt small.  Human.  Vulnerable.  There was a mile of freezing seawater between you and escape, and the lunatics had free run of the asylum... and drowning was something you would have no problem doing.  As Subject Delta (or, in Minerva's Den, Subject Sigma), you feel like a Big Daddy.  A little ponderous, but armoured, tough, and more than capable of beating a few splicers to death.The story isn't quite as brilliant either - in the first game, Rapture was new (to you), and everything was exploration of Andrew Ryan's ruined dream.  Well, in 2, Rapture is just as pretty, just as fascinating... but not quite as new.  There's a certain sense of familiarity for those who've played through the first game and spent quite a few hours in the slowly decaying city.  It's worth noting that as with the first game, the art assets for Bioshock 2 are stunning.  Post-apocalyptic art deco and water effects make for a feast for the eyes.Some of the new Plasmids (plus the ability to use guns and plasmids at the same time) make for some real fun, mechanically, and even if you're feeling like a nice, tough Big Daddy, the Splicers haven't been sitting still either.  There are some real challenges at the higher difficulty levels.Overall, if you don't have it, but have played Bioshock, get this game, and play it.  If you don't have it, and _haven't_ played Bioshock, get Bioshock.  Then get this game and play it. :)			"

												Bioshock 2 is a massive step up from the first game. The graphics have been improved and look more realistic and less like clay. The combat and weapons are refined and are much better. They took most of the problems from the first one and fixed them. For starters, you finally have a melee weapon that does damage! The wrench in BS1 was useless, but in BS2, you have a powerful drill, and you can also use your other weapons to melee. Another is that they fixed the lack of ammunition. In BS1, I barely scraped by the skin of my teeth. Ammo was insanely hard to find, and when you did find it, it indicated a boss fight or massive fight scene up ahead. But one problem I have is that the enemies do so much more damage to you. In BS2, you play as an old Big Daddy. Yet, it seems like your armour is useless as the enemies pound through it. By far, this is the best Bioshock game to date, far surpassing Infinite. It may follow a repetitive gameplay style, but it is so addictive. The voice acting is incredibly good, and you will find yourself attached to characters like Sinclair who guide you to stopping Lamb. It's both the same, and far different than Bioshock 1.But one of the main things I love about this game is how they changed the hacking mechanics. Originally, to hack something, you had to click on tiles and drag pipes and connect them so water flows from the input to the output. This was incredibly tedious, and I hated it so much that I tryed to avoid hacking as much as possible (except when I needed ammo). I was overjoyed to see that in BS2, they added a more easier hacking system. Just press the arrow when it's over a green or blue square. If you miss, you get electrocuted or it summons a security alarm which spawns the annoying little helibots.But the best improvement is gathering Adam. In BS1, to get Adam, you have to find a Little Sister. To get to a Little Sister, you have to go through her Big Daddy defender. Once you did that, you could either harvest or rescue her. But in BS2, there is a third option. Instead, you can 'adopt' her, she sits on your shoulder until you find a suitable Adam source. While she gathers it, you defend her from the Splicers while the protaganists mock you.  I love how they improved the relationship between Little Sister and Big Daddy, and now you can become a part of that. Bioshock 2 is hands down the best Bioshock experience. Its as dark as its predecessor, but has much better game mechanics and graphical improvements. The characters, from Sinclair to Lamb are engaging and really interesting people. The worlds are bigger and beautiful than Bioshock 1. Fantastic sequel. Improved mechanics, awesome story and graphics.8/10			"

												The ultimate anal-drilling-simulation leaves a bit of an aftertaste of ♥♥♥♥ in the players mouth, which might source from the fact that gameplay from the first game remains virtually unchanged, or that at heart, you drill splicers bumholes until they explode or you spend hours drilling a big daddy until he anticlimatically doesn't explode.Bioshock 2 has great level design and an above average story (which contains more plotholes than you can create bumdrilling splicers in the entire game) and continues the atmosphere of the first game in most aspects. If you are really into diving for  30 seconds max in between shootouts, you might really like this game too. Although it might not seem that way, the game has really good pacing and never have I felt bored playing the game, although it can be tiring to fight a big sister with as much health as a ♥♥♥♥ing level 90 tank in WoW. Most of that comes from the weaponry; as I previously mentioned, you get to shove your typical Big-Daddy-Drill into any splicers bumhole, and there are a couple really powerfully handled, awesome weapons to be found and upgraded. You feel actuallystrong in the game, not just like some flexed up Bodybuilder with double the ♥♥♥♥ that his mother possessed. But just like that particular roid-rage Arnold-Cutout, Bioshock 2 has one great weakness: The Glory of his predecessor. You can't top Arnold. He is just too glorious.Would I recommend? Yes.Would I say ""Iss best Bioshock GG""? No.Would I try out the rotating Fist position? Possibly.8/10 would drillfist again "

HOWEVER... the multiplayer is completely dead. this was extremely dissapointing. No matter what you do. you will be sitting in a empty server for 30+ minutes and no one will ever join. And lets say they did ""Which they didn't"" you will need at least 10 people each game type at least. for most of the gametypes.basically I was pretty ♥♥♥♥ing disapointed. the multiplayer was simply looking really sweet. and its kinda dishearting that a AAA game like this could not have mutiplayer servers. basically its set up like PVP so you cannot serach or find in a list you just click a button and hope someone joins.

												I played Bioshock Infinite first (never played a shooter before), and I have to admit that I couldn't get very interested in the story because I just found out how fun it was to shoot everything and how beautiful everything looked. Then I started playing the first, and I wasn't caught by the story either (this is me, im not saying it's a bad game or anything like it). And then I started this one and at first I thought it was kind of boring because being a BD didn't seem as interesting, but as I kept going I really liked the story, and yes, the levels are kind of tedious and repetitive -missions- but the story developes to a point where I didn't know what kind of ending I was going to get and I loved that.Yes, mine also crashed and gave me some simple bugs as, enemies getting stuck or things like that, so I had to keep TWO SAVES and constantly save in case the game failed. this is my favorite bioshock... u guys made me cry			"

												After playing the first two games in the BioShock series and starting the third, I can honestly say I like 2 more. Gameplay and Customization: BioShock 2 managed to fix the clunkiness of its predecessor when it comes to shooting. It allows iron sights, which is awesome, and quick plasmid usage. The way this works it you have a weapon on your main hand and plasmid on your off hand at the same time. The variety of plasmids is also cool. The customization of BioShock games never cease to amaze me. Whether you want to be big badass Delta with a drill and offensive plasmids, or take a more subtle approach with the spear gun and stealthy plasmids, Bioshock 2 can provide such an experience. Hacking and Research: This game decided to simplify hacking. Instead of having to play a puzzle minigame like in BioShock, you now need to land the hack needle on green or blue zones, green successfuly completeing hack while blue doing the same plus giving a free item. The Research system was overhauled. Instead of taking pictures of the target to gain research, now you have to video tape them. To get the best possible research, one must kill the target using a mixture of weapons, plasmids, npcs or security bots. Story and Atmosphere:	 I don't understand why people don't like the story of BioShock 2. Though it doesnt follow Jacks life, which was clearly ended at the end of BioShock, its still pretty interesting.  The adventure of Delta and Sinclair on their way to save Eleanor was a great idea. They made sure to make you sad when you had to put down Sinclair. Also the endings are either sad of bad, there is no real happy one.  BioShock 2 does a great job in keeping the experience atmospheric, just like in the first game. Overall:	 This game is better than the first one. If you like any of the above features, its a must have. 10/10 would take fall damage to see Delta make a mini earthquake.			"

												This game, though not as atmopsheric as the first game is nonetheless a wonderful experience to behold. The combat system, if somewhat imbalanced the first round is more exciting here. You get a whole host of new weapons to wield and with the camera research system, it also awards you for being creative enough to combine multiple ways to destroy your enemies. The hacking system has also been revamped and greatly improved, no longer must you figure out how to twist and place tubes but instead try to hack system whilst dodging enemy fire makes for a exciting experience. The choice system is also more nuanced and rather than ending with Very Good vs Very Bad, it takes into account how your actions with non-Little Sister characters would affect you (greatly missing from the first game).The story expands the Rapture universe, if the first game is somewhat large-than-life when it comes to your characters, Bioshock 2 helps makes them more human. It also smartly avoids to try and emulate the first twist that was the first game and made the storyline simple, you're a Big Daddy and now you must rescue your Little Sister. Rather than just keeping it that simple, it also introduces Ryan's counterpart with Sofia Lamb, who is an antagonist who took the extreme version of Ryan's much hated Altruism to its logical point (and this works better here than Bioshock Infinite's extremism comparisons but I digress).One of the few cons, however is that the creepy atmosphere of the first game is quite missing. Even though you're exploring the more downtrodden areas of Rapture, I find it more bright and more combat focused than the beginning. And the PC version had audio bugs and glitches that seriously undermines the more dramatic aspects of the game. Imagine you're playing an area where you're besieged by Splicers but the audio decides to fritz up and you fight in total silence. I would also like to comment on how this game crashes at odd moments - if you're the sort to forget to save once in a while, say goodbye to your progress and you will be forced to replay the level from the beginning. The Multiplayer aspect is a hit and miss. It would have been fun but due to a lack of servers, you'd forced to either wait for some time for everyone to play (and even then it's rare for one to be able to play anything besides Civil War). Forget about a balance firefight as well, since this game loves to match the newbies with veterans and it's not uncommon to pitch a group pf low leveled players against more experienced ones and watch as a team gets slaughtered in the process. But to be able to see the areas you could only explore in Bioshock return here was amazing, even if you could only explore it solo. I would still recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed Bioshock but wanted some improvements with certain game mechanics. All in all, this game is a worthy addition to the Bioshock series. 4/5			"

												If you thought the first Bioshock was great, get ready for an experience that you wouldn't forget. This game made a fantastic leap from the first game. Playing as the Big Daddy (yes the big daddy), you have to find your daughter in Rapture. You are given an arsenal ranging from spear guns to rivet Guns. You also have a wide range of powers including: Electricity, Hypnosis and fire! Amazing story!A must buy 9/10			"
