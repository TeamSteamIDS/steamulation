												I've had my heart broken several times in my life. Once, on Christmas Day 1989, I eagerly ran downstairs and gasped at the sight of what was clearly a crudely but lovingly wrapped skateboard. A skateboard that I had wanted ever since I had seen Marty McFly cruise through the streets of Hill Valley as a stowaway behind an unsuspecting SUV driver. A skateboard with a custom deck, with artwork that would cause my fellow skaters to shout ""rad"". A skateboard whose wheels would send me gliding across the streets as I headed for the nearest half-pipe. A skateboard of majestical proportion.I grabbed it, and with shaking hands and a heart beating against my chest, I tore that festive wrapping as hard as I could. Through an intricate web of sticky tape, ribbon and ever expanding wrapping paper, I dug through. Years later, I wondered that this is what Andy in The Shawshank Rdemption must have felt like as he dragged hinself through the tunnels. My own redemption was in sight. My prize was near. Finally, the last shred of packaging fell away to the floor. And there it was... a plastic skateboard from the local store. With stiff plastic wheels. And a picture of a clown on the deck. That's what playing Aliens: Colonial Marines felt like.			"

												MORALS AND IDEALSAs most of you know, this game was basically announced as an AAA game with next gen graphics, and ended up a (at the time) bug-ridden B-list game with last gen graphics. Many people were understandably upset about this, especially those who pre-ordered. If you don't wish to do business with a company that found itself in a lawsuit claiming false advertising, more power to you for your ideals.THE GAMEI played this in Jan 2015 after some massive patches, and after the game was on sale for $5. At this point, I experienced the game as practically bug-free, except for the astonishing fact that the game still won't let you go: When I quit the game, it is immediately restarted (wrong exit code or something?). Restarting Steam too helps, but it's a bit ridiculous. On the upside: no game-breaking or fun-killing bugs while I played.STORY MODEThe game is pretty straight forward in that there are no optional side-missions, and the level design is such that in campaign mode, it is extremely rare that there is more than one way to get from A to B. Gameplay-wise, it's a squad shooter in that your avatar is hardly ever alone, yet you cannot give orders to non-player squadmates. The campaign is open to 1-4 players, but incomprehensibly, players can't configure their avatar; they're assigned a premade one even though only one of them appears in cut scenes or has any dialog. The loadout however is still configurable.VERSUSTwo teams of 1-5 players each can face off in various aliens vs marines modes; for this, you can configure the look and loadout of your avatar (including male/female - there's also a Movie Characters DLC with 4 chars none of which is female. Maybe Ripley was too expensive to license, but where's my Vasquez??).CHALLENGESApart from Steam Achievements (some of which are for the sole story DLC, Stasis Interrupted), ACM features challenges. Proceeding in the story or meeting challenges results in more customization options (some purely cosmetic, others ways to make the various guns more powerful, though squads with players on different levels seem unproblematic).These suffer from having a required order -- you won't get credit for a challenge that isn't up yet. Also, there are challenges that require other players outside the ""Versus"" challenge category, implying that as a single player, you can't even finish the ""General"" category. Meh.You'll revisit a lot of the story for the Challenges/Collectibles, but since you can only jump to Chapters but not savepoints within them, you'll waste a lot of time getting to the scene you need.THE GRAPHICSThe graphics are serviceable. The texture resolution could be a little bit higher, but then, it could always be a little bit higher. Considering that this is after a 4 GB patch that included better textures, I'm scared to imagine what the game may have looked like at release. Now however, it does its job; as long as you don't expect Alien: Isolation, you might be satisfied; just keep in mind that this is Dead Island to Isolation's Dying Light. There are some enbseries presets for this game that amplify bloom and color grade in favor of blues, as you would expect from an '80s movie -- especially Aliens. (Apparently, one preset even adds a ""VHS look"".) I find this to slightly improve the graphics, but only so much -- nothing like the drastic results I had with presets for e.g. Fallout New Vegas etc; it may or may not be your thing.THE SETWe meet pretty much everything you'd want from an Aliens game in ACM: loaders, dropships, the Sulaco, various types of alien including the queen, and hey, you get the shoot the pulse rifle. (I'm easily satisfied that way.) You also get to deploy auto-guns, use the smartgun, etc. You get to shoot aliens in Hadley's Hope on LV-426, in the space jockey ship, on the Sulaco, and various other beloved sets. You pay for this with some inconsistencies -- some understandable and even welcome  (for you to frolic in Hadley's Hope, they had to downgrade its destruction level from vaporized to condemned); some incomprehensible (the dropship and consequently the APC look subtly, but noticeably too narrow, and so does the Sulaco's hangar). I remember Aliens very, very fondly (while at the same time not being enough of a fanatic to notice that e.g. the individual crewmembers' cryo-sleep booths on the Sulaco weren't in the same order as in the film, or that someone's locker opened to the wrong side), so for me, the set alone was worth the price of admission. (The engineer's ship is a bit boring, but then, we never really saw much except for the space jockey and the eggs in Alien, either. It's big and empty, and I guess it's supposed to be.)THE STORYThe story isn't outright horrible, and it ticks the expected boxes (some people get ""impregnated"", some people get cocooned, lots of people and lots of aliens die; the marines are good, the company is bad, and the usual gear is used etc.), but it is hardly material for a movie that might stand alongside Aliens. The main plot motivates a lot of shooting, and traversal from one set piece to the next, but does little for me beyond that; the story ends very suddenly, giving away what might have been an emotionally satisfactory coda; and it can be a little non-obvious in the heat of battle which of the identical twin ships your captain is on at any given moment. It's not horrible, but it could have been so much more. It could, arguably, also have been longer, with the main campaign clocking in at less than 10 hours.Some plot points are cleared up in the prequel DLC ""Stasis, interrupted"", thus continuing the worrying trend where you have to pay extra for closure as it's no longer part of the main game (cf. ""Broken Steel"" for ""Fallout 3"", Tina's DLC for Borderlands 2).VERDICTSo, is it justified?As an excuse to revisit beloved sets, it certainly is. As an excuse to do much shooting with fun guns, it is, too. As plot and production values go, it is a wasted opportunity, though in all fairness not on the level of Alien^3 which instead of taking us to earth, or the home planet of the aliens, or that of the engineers, gave us the stakes of the lives of few dozen ugly killers and rapists, and then didn't let us root for the alien because the SFX looked so pitiful.While I'm normally a ""strictly co-op"" girl, some of the vs maps and modes were surprisingly fun. Due to the lack of maps, you'll need DLC quickly: Bug Hunt is a fun new mode with 3 maps and a friendly community.If you're an online player, factor BH into your budget; it's where the game shines. If you're strictly single-player, get Stasis Interrupted instead, to beef up the very short story mode of the main game.If you want to shoot fun guns in familiar, beloved sets and you can get the game on sale, ACM should be fun for a few hours -- as long as you don't expect a AAA title with brilliant writing and next-gen graphics, which I'm sure nobody does after the massive backlash. It's definitely a can-have, but no must-have. In the end, it's down to whether you believe that after the massive backlash and financial losses, the industry got the point that all the foul play of the early days wasn't on, or whether you believe we still need to make a point. In the former case, you may want to curb your expectations and give it a go; in the latter, you'll be right to give it a pass.Steam forces me to tick yes or no, so I'll go with ""no"", by a whisker, simply because while I had fun, it falls short of its announcement, there could have been more multi-player maps, more/better plots and graphics, etc. -- the patched version is never horrible, it's actually fun enough, but it's also noticeably lacking, just a bit, but in every category. ""No"" to lack of closure, ""no"" the charade around its publication, ""no"" because of what could've been, and now likely won't ever come to pass, or at least not for a very long time.			"

												When this came out it was terrible. Absolutely terrible.   If you were a fan of the Movie, you could get alot out of it just for the nerd-out factor of being on-set, but other than that the gameplay was like a bad COD rip-off, the aliens were NOT scary or hard, and the WY Mercs were frustratingly good at soaking up bullets. The graphics were occasionaly pause-and-look-worthy but most of it was a letdown.I have now been modding the game for 2 months and I am up to version 4 of my mod at this time.I've fixed alot of the graphical issues with how the game was configured, removed Console related restrictions, and set things to match todays computers (this is an Unreal game). I've also spent time with some of the cooler set-pieces to make them even cooler.I have reworked the Xenomorph AI to be fast, smart, sneaky and deadly, the Merc AI to be less robot like and more vulnerable and the Ally AI better at combat and positioning.Weapons have all been reworked to feel like real world weapons and more varied and powerful.How you move, and how the first person view functions has been changed to give a better sense of motion and urgency, the HUD no longer shifts around the screen moving your cross-hair, and you can turn the whole HUD off.You get the Smart-Gun about 5 times now. That alone makes the game heaps better!If you are a fan of Aliens and see this on sale, buy it, install my mod and enjoy a fantastic Aliens experience			"

												Are you a fan of the Alien franchise? Are you one of the many gamers that eagerly awaited the release of this game since it's announcement in 2004? If yes to the above, prepare to be severely disappointed.Aliens: Colonial Marines is a first person shooter that acts as a sequel to the 1986 sci-fi classic, Aliens. The game follows a USCM Marine named Winter, along with his utterly boring and unmemorable companions. The plot has Winter and the Marines of the USS Sephora returning to LV426 to investigate the disappearance of Ripley and her companions from the original film.The story of this game is a senseless mess, and at times, makes no sense whatsoever. A character that was explained dead in the film makes an appearance in this game ( his magical reappearance isn't explained at all by the way) and ridiculous events will occur to keep the game moving at Michael Bay pace. None of the characters are remotely likeable or memorable, and they certainly frustrated me to the point of turning the game off. All of these problems could have been fixed if more attention had been paid to the writing process of this game. Or the whole game for that matter.The gameplay doesn't fare much better than the writing of this game. Most of the guns feel like airsoft equivalents, and the shooting in question feels tedious and lacks tension. The enemy AI is woefully poor, and most of the time you'll face off against human enemies rather than the xenomorphs themselves. The level design is boring and linear, and all the indoor locations feel like the same grey corridor you went through just a few moments ago. The outside levels impress you at first, until you realise they are just as linear and restricting as the indoor ones.This game's only saving grace is its multiplayer mode. There are a variety of game modes, many of which are creative and innovative for the FPS genre; but although these are alot of fun, they're let down somewhat by the overall poor gameplay mechanics. It's a shame this doesn't provide the quality that'd easily help it compete with the likes of Natural Selection 2.As an Aliens fan, I am very disappointed. Save your money eveyone, there's an awesome Alien game coming out in 2014 called Alien: Isolation. Save your money. 4 / 10. "

												If you meet the following criteria, you will possibly enjoy this game:1) You paid $5 or less for this.2) You only bought it for the single player campaign.3) You can overlook that the game did not meet its launch expectations.4) You are a fan of the Aliens franchise.5) As a fan of the franchise you can overlook many of the implausible settings the game uses.If you can pass all that, then you have a chance at enjoyment.*Spoilers*The game is basically sticking you in the role of a Colonial Marine and having you retread the sights of LV-426.  You'll walk the halls of the U.S.S Sulaco, you will land at Hadley's Hope, you will explore Operations and in the end you will even visit the Engineer ship where the franchise began.  Each area is pretty much a giant easter egg filled with tiny easter eggs.  You'll stumble over the spent sentry guns from the Aliens director's cut, one still containing 10 rounds.  You'll find the room where Burke, Carter J. met his cowardly end.  The medical bay where Ripley and Newt were attacked by face-huggers is here as well, with overturned beds and bullet-shattered glass.  While crawling through the sewers you can even find the head of Newt's doll that we last saw floating sadly on the water.That said, a lot of plausibility of those easter eggs was sacrificed in the name of coolness.  Sure, it's cool to pick up Hicks' shotgun but why is ""No Fate"" carved into it?  Sure I get it, same actor but why would Dwayne Hicks scratch that on his darling for close encounters?As far as the gameplay itself goes, it is clunky but passable.  You will either overlook it because you like Aliens that much or you will turn the game off after 5 minutes.  Or perhaps you will do both - I myself played for 5 minutes before putting it down for a year.  When I played it again I beat it all the way through just out of curiosity.  Found myself slightly entertained though, I admit, more by the settings and the little things than the actual story.  On that note, the story - if you have played an Aliens game or watched an Aliens movie than you know the story already.  Weyland-Utani are bad guys, they want the alien and will stop at nothing to do their experiments.  Nothing new here.This is basically a game for fans of Aliens who can also overlook the disrespect towards that very movie's canon, shown over and over again via easter eggs.  If you fit the bill than I recommend this title to you!			"

(This review contains major spoilers.)This one really hurts.As a lifelong fan of the Alien franchise, I've had to put up with some terrible uses of the license. The reason I got into this series in the first place was because of Alien 3. I've played through the janky platformer/shoot-em-up versions of Aliens on some of the oldest console. I even suffered through the 2004 Alien Vs. Predator film and Prometheus.Yet there was one game I was absolutely convinced would be great - Aliens: Colonial Marines. On the surface, it seemed like such a sure-win proposition: Gearbox Software helming an FPS that pays tribute to all the militaristic aspects of the Alien universe, wrapped up in the kind of quality they're known for. You can't miss with that, right?What a shame, then, that the final product is such a mishmash of ideas. I know about the accounts of development - the multiple developers all having a hand in it, the half-baked storyline that was rewritten continuously through production, the lies and disingenuous marketing - but for all that, is there any good to be found in the game?Colonial Marines puts you into the (combat) boots of Cpl. Christopher Winter, an everyman protagonist who is part of the crew of a combat warship called the Sephora. The ship is dispatched to intercept the USS Sulaco after receiving a distress call from Cpl. Dwayne Hicks, one of the survivors of Aliens. Sent into the Sulaco to rendezvous with other members of the Sephora Marines, Winter not only discovers another xenomorph infestation, but also the influence of Weyland-Yutani, who are working to breed a queen for their own needs.That's all the plot you need to remember, because the ensuing levels become an intermittent battle with both xenomorphs and W-Y mercs in Call of Duty-like shooting galleries via locations from the film.I consider this game to be an ""interesting failure"". There are some interesting concepts and ideas that could have been notable or innovative in a better game, but they're lost in a messy hodgepodge of janky-looking graphics, terrible AI and weak story hooks. And even worse, this is apparently considered canon (that is, an official part of the Aliens storyline) by 20th Century Fox, despite not making a lick of sense.This truly looks like a game that could have been made in the late 90's. In fact, it might even be built from the scraps of the supposedly-cancelled PS2 version that was supposed to be released way back in the early 2000s. All the worst vices of FPS games from that era are on full display here. Health and armor pickups (pick up seven chestpieces in a row to get max armor). A weird hybrid between ""only being able to carry a limited amount of weapons"" and ""every weapon is on you at the same time anyway"" that feels like it was taken from Duke Nukem Forever. Enemies that make a beeline towards you and act like morons in melee combat. Enemies that have health pickups explode like a pinata out of their body when they die. The list goes on.The characters aren't any better. Any sense of tension or drama in regards to whether Bella can be saved is moot, as you find out she's been impregnated with a facehugger even before you meet her. O'Neil veers between being alternately whiny and arrogant, and his bored facial impressions do nothing to endear him to the player (even though he's your main squadmate for the majority of the game). The sole standout is Ashley Burch's performance as Reid, a pilot who progresses from using clunky expospeak to being one of the few (the only?) supporting teammate who feels like they've had some legitimate development and you can understand their motivations.Then there's Corporal Dwayne Hicks himself, who has apparently returned from the dead. He's adopted a dour and sarcastic demeanor due to his experiences between the film and the game, but I can't tell if that's legitimate character development or Michael Biehn being bored. He handwaves his apparent survival with a nonsensical explanation that it's a ""much longer story"", and even the explanation we do get in the Stasis Interrupted DLC is at odds with just about everything we saw in Alien 3.That's not to say it's all bad, though. Going through the various environments and finding audio logs, collectible weapons and Easter eggs is a treat, even if it's short-lived. There are a few moments that evoke a far better game, like the ""Raven"" level, where you're forced to stealth your way past aliens that explode if you make too much noise. There's also patches that greatly increase the difficulty level, finally putting it up to the level of a modern shooter.For all that, though, they still horribly squandered the license. The new alien types look like something that were ripped from the Kenner toyline, without any sense of originality or thought process (you can't tell me that a Alien faction multiplayer mode wouldn't have been better over the bog-standard gametypes we got). The use of voice actors from the film in the game and its DLC (including Mark Ralston, Lance Henriksen, Al Matthews and Biehn) feels half-hearted and unappreciated. There's all these references to events from the film, but it's mired in mediocrity and/or so easy to miss that you don't care half the time. The lethargic and floaty animations (on both sides) take you out of the action and make you focus on the bugs, janky graphics and weak gunplay.In the end, Aliens: Colonial Marines is a terrible use of the license, and is only worth picking up if you find it on sale. I wouldn't recommend buying this game at full price.			"

Posted: October 24, 2014
												This is difficult for me to say, but it has to be said. I've loved the alien franchise since i was 4 years old (26 now) so for me to say no on this hits home quite hard on this one. I shall explain why through pros, cons. and overall at the end. Before i start, let me say this. I Recommend this game but only for the die hard alien franchise fans and people that love playing the role of a colonial marine and also only if you are prepared to see the worst 'official' canon to a franchise in history (Seriously, the storyline is that bad).Now, onto the Pros and Cons.PROS:1. It's in the alien universe. Between colonies being based on moons, exploration into space, and the fact that the alien is such a terrifying creature by nature it's fun to have a go at killing them. And your a Colonial Marine with a Pulse Rifle and array of weaponry. Cool!2. Revisiting places form the 2nd film is cool (Even though the blast would of cleared everywhere that the game is set.)3. The music and sounds are true to the film and do slightly absorb you into the atmosphere (Where there is any).4. The multiplayer (If you can find a game) is actually quite entertaining and fun. It's slightly more biased to the alien side in my opinion, however it is fun. It is truly the saving grace of this game.5. Stasis Interupted and Bug Hunt are actually quite good pieces of DLC. Although many argue Bug Hunt should of been part of the actual game and not DLC it's actually worth the price (Fans + New Game = Money money money)  6. The Co-op Campaign is actually decent fun with friends/randoms.7. If your a massive aliens fan, you bare the game out (Pulse Rifles baby! lol). You go on the Sulaco, LV-42, the Derelict e.t.c. which is pretty neat.CONS: 1. The storyline (from the viewpoint of a hardcore alien franchise view) is pitiful and pathetically executed at best. It's disgusting to think that gearbox could do what they did to the franchise. 2. The gameplay is basic - it's a 'too linear' shooter which has nothing original or new to offer the aliens series or gamers in general.3.  The mulltiplayer died after 2 weeks of release. This was the games saving grace (As mentioned in pros) The only surviving Multiplayer is lingering among steam groups and they are only hosted here and there at best. 4. Nothing like it's demo trailer. This has been said over and over again website to website forum to forum - but really when it was released and your expecting this kick♥♥♥♥♥segment and it turns into poo...come on gearbox.5. Graphically it looks good...if it was released in 2007. This really isn't a pro or con, but come on SEGA/gearbox, the hell!6. It's such a cop out to the franchise. The alien is surposed to be this creature of terrifying appearance and presence, yet you do not feel scared by it at all. I get it, it's a shooter, but...the alien...and also the different types of alien are so bland (Drone Spitter Lurker) - i mean come on, AYFKM (Are You F**ing Kidding Me) SEGA/Gearbox.7.Given it's development history, it's no surprise that the game was in shambles. Between going from one company to another company to another company not all the blame can be put on gearbox, just 90% of it.8. To this day, i still say that the lack of dedicated servers are what lead to the true demise for the multiplayer. People copped the lack of authentic weaponry for the marines, the lack of not feeling like the same alien no matter the class, but some dedicated servers guys!! They could of at least done this for us.9. Sweet lord, the AI is absolute rubbish. I mean it's Daikatana meets COD AI. It's just.....ugh. The AI in the 1999 AVP was better than this.10. If your like me, and paid full price on release day for this game, you felt jipped. OVERALL:If you like/love the aliens franchise, you'll bare this game.

												Failiens: Colonial O`NeilIt is a really sad and emotional story of a man and comrade, who wants to be accepted by his squad, by his environment and by his enemy. In his struggle to fight against fearsome opponents like an open door through which he can`t step, emotions that he doesn´t want to show. Even his best companion, the smartgun inside of his hands, finally betrays him, as well, and decides to not hit anything. I had to cry a lot at the ending of the game. The game was full of emotions, sacrificeAnd hard decisions like shall I go left or right to reach the room in front of me.And there are exciting missions where you have the choice that your actions really matter.Will you walk fast or slow down the hallway? Will you reload your weapon by hand or will theAutomatic reload function do so? Man, this game is an absolute thrill!Of course the 9 DLCs are totally worth it as well! Must have for horde mode and some other recycled missions11 out of 10			"

												Aliens: Colonial Marines is awful.This review is written after playing 'hard'... yeah it wasn't that hard.As a big fan of Alien(s), Colonial Marines sounded like it could've been awesome. But in the end what we got was another generic modern FPS. Aim-down-sights? Check. Fighting against generic humans? Check. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ regening-health? Somewhat check. Boring story? Check.The gameplay is repetitive, boring, generic, and painful. Like shooting at bland enemies with weapons, that sound like♥♥♥♥♥♥ in a bland level that offers so little in terms of design that in order to incentivize exploration the developers had to place pointless collectibles like dogtags, audio logs, and 'legendary weapons'?! (HA! Gorman's pistol and Frost's flamethrower are considered legendary weapons... like most people would even know who Frost is XD. Not to forget Gorman is far from anyones favourite Aliens character.) If you like any of this stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥ you'll love CM. But I don't!The AI in this game is garbage. Xenos just sprint in a straight line at you. Sound fun? Sound challenging? It isn't. Xenos'll even sometimes just stand in the middle of a room, staring at you, doing nothing. Great... not like the human enemies are much more challenging.Yes, you heard me right. You trade shots behind bland cover with bland, generic, human soldiers. At least half of the game is spent fighting these guys. Instead of... well... you know... THE XENOMORPHS.This game is way too easy. Did I die? Sure. But was it hard? No. Like I said before, the AI is stupid. Since the Aliens just run at you there is no challenge, just click on the bad guys a few time.You may be asking: ""What do you mean by '♥♥♥♥♥♥ regening-health? Somewhat check'?""Well... You have 3 health bars, and each health bar can regen, but it can't regen above it-self. So let's say you are at half-health (in the second bar), you will regen the second bar full, but you won't regen the third bar. You can pick up medkits to regen lost bars. This is the same system from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AvP3. And yes, it sucks♥♥♥♥♥So how is the story?!So Colonial Marines takes place after Alien 3; and once again Weyland-Yutani are stupid (SHOCKING?! RIGHT?! It isn't like at this point in the series this must be like the fourth time they've failed at using the xenos... if we count Alien: Isolation of course). But I'll start from the beginning. So Hicks (voiced by Michael Biehn, who sounds as bored as♥♥♥♥♥♥ sends a distress call after the events of Aliens. So then a bunch of marines from the USS Sephora or some♥♥♥♥♥♥like that (This story is so forgettable so bare with me I don't remember much) are sent to investigate. They find the Sulaco, over LV-426, and are sent over to the Sulaco. They find the cryotubes holding Ripley, Newt, Hicks, and Bishop, which are ejected. (Oh yeah I forgot to mention that the Sulaco went over to Fury-161 then the pods were ejected. Then the Sulaco went back to LV-426 because we have to go to LV-426... Yeah this game's story is just ♥♥♥♥ing stupid) So then of course (SHOCKINGLY) we find out the Sulaco is infested with Xenomorphs. I won't spoil anything but just know the game's story is painfully predictable and boring. (kinda like... Alien: Isolation)Now does this mean there isn't any good parts of this♥♥♥♥♥♥teir game? No. I do actually like the part where you go into the derelict from Alien (Even if you do fight humans in this part), The Egg cargo hold is huge (And Awesome!)! You also get to see the jockey! (Which I mean... we've seen a thousand times in AvPClassic and AvP2... but it's still cool). I also enjoyed the level where you get to explore Hadley's Hope (even if that makes no sense... because wasn't it blown up?).But the negatives outweight the postives. The 3 dollars I bought this for, during a sale, wasn't even worth it. I haven't had the chance to play Multi-player yet, but I doubt it'll be anything special. The only game based off of Aliens I think is worse than this is AvP 2010.I can't even justify this game to hardcore fans of Alien(s). If you want a better FPS based off of Aliens pick up Aliens vs Predator Classic 2000 on Steam, not this generic modern-day garbage (or maybe even AvP2 if you can find a copy, just for the single-player though, the multi-player sucks in that game).♥♥♥♥ Aliens: Colonial Marines.-MandatoryAlcatraz "

												I bought this on the 360 when it came out, and it was an unplayable mess.I bought it on steam when I saw how much Gearbox upgraded on the PC that would never make it to a console. I got it on sale, so I didn't feel like I was getting cheated too badly, having to buy it twice. After the initial patches, it was a playable mess.Then the support dried up. The servers began to wither and die. Gearbox forgot about the game. Sega went on to release the admittedly and infinitely superior Alien: Isolation and forgot all about this little space shooter. So did I, for a time. I let it fall to the wayside, despite modders over on ModDB like Cilitbang, who managed to remove mercs from the Bug Hunt DLC. I just sort of...stopped playing. I moved on.But TemplarGFX didn't.Version 4.5 of his mod is a light in the darkness. It is a revelation. The game went from horrendous, poorly rendered crap to a beautiful landscape and smooth textures. The AI went from being the dumbest creatures to ever exist to ACTUALLY hunting you. You know, like a xenomorph would. The gameplay tweaks, the balancing, the improved difficulty, the visuals, everything about this game once you have installed the TemplarGFX 4.5 mod and Cilitbang's Bug Hunt (No Mercs/No Dino Heads/Welding Enabled) mod is what the game SHOULD have been at launch. A little sad that it's taken us four years to get here, but here we are. Finally.If it is on sale, snag this one. Hop over to moddb (dot) com and look for the TemplarGFX mod. Look for the Cilitbang Bug Hunt Mod. Install them. Tweak your .ini. Blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up.If you are feeling really frisky, download Cilitbang's ReShade profile for Templar GFX and your screen gets transformed into the helmet cam just like in the film.3/10 Console version5/10 without mods8.5/10 with mods.9/10 with mods and friends that actually play Bug Hunt.

												Well OK, I just did - I played this whole thing from the start to finish and here is my verdict. If you´re not an ULTRA BADASS Alien Fan don´t waste time and the money for torturing yourself. I have to admit that in the beginning the game was fun. Really it was but the game has some technical issues. I don´t wanna talk about the graphical issues we all know about. Sometimes the level design is scarier than the Xenos themnself. The Weyland mercs are just a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥!! I don´t mind fighting against Xenos all the time, even if they look always the same that is what Aliens the movie was about. There were no mercs that look like a cheap copy of Half-Life2 Combines... Some levels are so long and boring just the achievements kept me moving on. Yeah the game features achievements lots of them some are quite easy to ""achieve"" some are insanely hard to get. The sound is quite good and sometimes the sounds down in the sewers are quite frightning. The Aliens in the sewers by the way are just a bad joke. They walk with a limp - that´s weird. I like how they crawl along the ceiling and the floor but you better not turn your flashlight on down in the sewers - this part of the game is just a joke and not funny at all. The voice acting from the main characters is quite cool - Bishop sounds best IMHO. Steam shows me a play time of about 18 hours I haven´t checked the time before I started my playthrough but I think it must have been about 6 to 7 hours I needed.  In the end I have to say that I will not reccommend the game due to the many flaws I encountered during the playthrough. Thanks for reading!

												Mediocre in every possible way.I heard lots of bad things about this, before i bought it on sale. Did i regret buying it? no. Is it really that bad? no.But sloppy execution, bugs, glitches and bad writing are breaking it's neck.I mean...how hard can it be to do a decent story with Marines vs Aliens in it?Well, this story doesn't contribute much to the franchise...actually...nothing really at all.The Story is not really worth mentioning.You will visit some locations from the second movie (which brings back some nostalgia) and the atmosphere was captured pretty well (throughout the whole game).The levels sometimes feel, like they were taken out from the movie (not graphical wise unfortunatey).Graphics are decent, no masterpiece, but good enough.The lightning is pretty well done in my opinion and does a lot to create a threatening atmosphere.The gamplay is...well ""okay"".If you fight against xenomorphs, it can be pretty intense. Fighting against soldiers from Wayland Yutani? Boring as hell...feels like any other shooter than an alien shooter.And seriously? Red-dot sight on the pulse rifle? Who had this stupid idea?Same goes with being promoted within the game to higher ranks as a Marine...All that totally breaks immersion, together with spawning A.I. comrades next to you, if you reach a certain point of the level and they are too far away.Anyway, as the gameplay is pretty okay and the atmosphere is good, you could give this game a try (if it's on sale) when you like FPS and Aliens.Man...just imagine how good this could have been if they had polished it, and created a better story....missed chance.

												EDITED to reflect the 4.5 mini-mod. See below.I bought this steaming pile when it first came out, and even with sub-basement-level expectations it was a letdown. As of a few days ago, I'd clocked about two hours worth of five-minute sessions over four years.TemplarGFX's mod changes everthing.  Not only does the game now look amazing (no small thing in a movie license title) but battles with the xenos have gone from Unplayably Stupid to Flat-Out Thrilling. Turns out even fighting mercs is fun when you're mowing them down with a smartgun, which now appears in the game five times. And the large-scale outdoor battles really, really shine.If you've played this game already, the strategy's changed. A lot. Your motion tracker is no longer a cosplay prop, it's your new best friend. Watch as enemies circle the map looking using every vent, crawlspace and bulkhead to flank and scare the crap out of you.Sure, the story's still dumb as a box of dead facehuggers. Yep, it's still basically Borderlands in Aliens drag.Except now it's FUN. 9/10, would FUN againEDIT: I played through the campaign the first time without the 4.5 mini-mod on Rookie difficulty and it was really, really hard. (Which I loved. Check out my hours logged on Dark Souls.) Turns out this 2nd mod actually fixes the friendly AI, and with it the game balance. Squadmates are actually useful (if still poorly written), and the xenos will respond in kind instead of always immediately zeroing in on you. Fixes the difficulty, too; I did a victory lap on rookie and it was a fast-paced arcade-style blast, then tested soldier and it was plenty tough for my paltry skill level. Most importantly, the infamous Gravity Well sequence was playable without rage quits. I've added a star to reflect this, and will probably review again when v5 comes out.			"

												Out of curiosity to see how bad this really is, I got it for $5, played it, & have now lost a lot of respect for Gearbox. It is easily one of the worst games I have ever played. I see why it got bad reviews and it deserves every one. This is a unacceptable tragedy. If it were given another name and marketed as a low priced generic shooter, it would still be sickening. My advice, forget about this even if it goes f2p and play the Aliens vs Predator game from 2010 which is decent, around a 6.5/10. This game was $50 or more when it was released back in Feb 2014, and now as of August 2014, only six months later, it is only $15 and you can find it constantly on sale for only $5. That is how horrible this game is. It is the prom night dumpster baby of Aliens games.Holy ♥♥♥♥ this game is something else. It would be a decent game with some fun shooter elements if it weren't one of the buggiest, most poorly coded, generic games of all time. Example of its incredibly poor design: fighting through a level in the dlc Stasis Interrupted (which despite some people saying that it is much better than the regular game, it sucks equally as much as the normal game does) with no health packs, then when the next level loads, there are 4 health packs at the beginning which is completely pointless because it gives you full health at the start of a level and you don't even need them because you have to walk a ways to even see any enemies. What they did to this game is laughable and becomes more of a joke the longer you play. I have alt+tabbed out of the game to amend this review probably about thirty times, each time adding more and more bad things about the game, never once to add anything positive. It just gets worse and worse the more you play. One of the biggest flaws and one of the dumbest coding problems I have ever seen in any game in my life, and actually this is the only game I have ever seen do this since I started PC gaming back in 1997, is that when you close the game, it instantly relaunches all by itself... lol. The only way to close it is to alt+tab out, run task manager with ctrl+alt+del, and force close steam then force close aliens........ what a dumb sick joke. In-game is glitchy too. Achievements reset for no reason. I was near the end of a mission and had 3/5 melee kills for a achievement to get 5 in one mission, which is hard as fk since melee sucks bad and you can't get close to anything without dying quickly because only a couple of bullets or bites from a alien kills you, and I died and when it reloaded me at a previous checkpoint the achievement progress reset... So I got 3 melee kills again from the checkpoint, died, and they reset again...I am skipping every cutscene because not only do the character models have god awful movement like puppets and their mouths look like puppet mouths, and the voice acting is some of the worst of all time and the script is one of the worst of all time, the game is just so generally awful I just want to hurry up and finish. That and the cutscenes also perform horribly, very stuttery and jerky.Friendly AI in single player is broken. Sometimes they follow me to an objective, sometimes they don't. I know it is broken because many times I will be going to an objective alone and when I die and restart at the checkpoint, the marines will then come with me, basically letting me know that they should have came the first time but didn't because it is broken. Enemy AI is almost non-existent. They charge at you blindly or stand still and fire.The game engine is very generic. It feels EXACTLY like the Blood 2 game engine which is very old and horrible. It is also only about 6 hours long (thank God) which is a 100% ripoff when it first came out, and even still at $5 since the game sucks balls and you will not find even one online game going at any time, ever. You need to go to video options first thing and turn the field of view option all the way up because anything less is way too low. The pulse rifle is gargantuan and takes up the entire bottom-right 1/4 of the screen, and then some, even on the highest field of view. That's right, changing the field of view does not change the weapon size lol. The pulse rifle takes up more of the screen than most giant rocket launchers do on some war games. You unlock all of the primary weapons quickly and they all suck nuts save for the pulse rifle and tactical shotgun. I bought the sawed-off double barreled shotgun extra for 99 cents and it is one of the worst weapons I have ever seen. It sounds like a BB gun when you fire it and while you are reloading it you get killed. You might unlock a few more later like maybe the flamethrower but who cares because the game sucks anyway. You die randomly and you die alot just because of how powerless you are to how extremely generic combat is and them flooding you with aliens. And the enemy AI is non-existent: they run straight at you with no thought or care in the world. The most laughable part of the game is when you die. The death animation on your guy is the worst I have ever seen. When you die it turns black and white, goes into third person, and shows you dying and the animation looks, every time, like a kid pulling the strings on a puppet flopping him around awkwardly. The Alien just gets in your face and gently swings his arm at you all prissy like ""myeh!"" then you die. Sometimes there isn't even a death animation; the screen just goes black and white and you are laying on the ground dead. And even when you have full armor and health, you can still die in a couple of hits from a alien. Dying in the game really only comes from trial and error. I have only ever died because of one single reason: being flooded with so many enemies to the point of not being able to reload fast enough to keep up then they get in close and I'm dead. On the second or third try though I get through it, but it is still the only reason you will die in this game. Zero skill is involved. You do NOT want to die because it will usually set you back pretty far and having to redo something in such a bad game is a cruel joke by the developers. It is a trend with all bad games: poor checkpointing. The checkpoint system is half broken as well: on mission 10 when you have to survive the attack of the queen, I died once and it put me back to the checkpoint, I died a second time and when it loaded it glitched me to the next checkpoint past the queen without having to beat her... I consider it a blessing. The way enemies gib is awful and looks very primitive and amateurish. The way they gib looks EXACTLY like Blood 2 and that is a game from 1998 and it blew hard. The sound and music are instantly forgettable. If you were listening to someone play and not watching, were it not for the sound of the pulse rifle and radar blip you would never know it was an Alien game. And unlike every other Alien game, the radar isn't on-screen. You have to hold down Q. Dead enemies sometimes get stuck in a doorway and start flipping out. I die constantly from the enemies just doing instant dmg whenever you are in view of them, instant massive dmg usually. One or two hits from any enemy wipes out the armor that you just scavenged for, and then your health drops very quickly as well. Ranged enemies with guns have pinpoint accuracy so your only hope is to run and dodge behind obstacles if there are any and close the gap to get close enough to hit them. Or stay back and snipe. Graphics suck bad, character animations suck bad, voice acting is God crap awful and their words don't match their mouths, effects are garbage, sounds are crap, and so on and so on. And when combat is this generic and dull it is very distracting.The fact that 54% of all the steam reviews for this game are positive just shows that there are a ton of easily impressed people out there and that you can't ever, ever trust the review system. A long review was needed to give this the bashing it deserves. 3.5/10			"

												The Aliens movie franchise stems back all the way to 1979. It spawned a 1986 sequel Aliens that gets regarded as one of the best sci-fi horror action movies of all time. Aliens: Colonial Marines is a first person action horror shooter that follows five new marines on Acheron (LV-426) after the Aliens movie. You'll take the roll of Winters fighting off both Xenomorph aliens and soldiers from Weyland Yutani ('the Company') as he goes from the spaceship Sulaco to the planetoid's surface, through Hadley's Hope and into the furthest reaches of the alien hive. The sound design, music and voice acting are high points to the experience. Music that feel straight from the Aliens film if not late 70s space travel movies. You'll visit scenes straight out of the Aliens movie even if a lot of it was blew up before your arrival. The effects, lighting, fog, sounds and atmosphere blend together to put you in a place that fits the Aliens franchise. The blue planetoid, the white sterile walls of 'the Company,' exhaust in the narrow corridors aboard the space ship and even the fog layer over greenish black resin made by the aliens. Luckily the 'video feed filter' can get turned off so you can see the game without having a grainy fuzz like in the movie. In cut scenes the game doesn't have the video feed filter, so why should you?Chained with you throughout the game are your allies. Sometimes none, sometimes one, and other times five of them. They'll do their best to kill enemies, but they're inefficient. Enemies will sometimes walk right by them and head straight for you. The best part about your allies is using them to distract enemy soldiers, so you can flank them. The game makes good use of flanking with cat and mouse maps. But not with the Xenomorphs, they're usually in hallways or out in the open with them running straight at you. Thankfully, your allies cannot die, since they're part of the story. When the enemies are dead, they'll always be ready to show you the way waiting at whatever door you're supposed to be at next. You can clip right through them, so they're never in the way.You have three bars of health in the game. Each bar regenerates unless you've lost the bar completely. Then you need med kits that give you full health. Over that you have armor that doesn't regenerate. You just need to find more armor lying around or from dead soldiers. Heavy soldiers drop full armors, so its easy enough to find it and lose it. Its a good system.You'll face off against a variety of different aliens. For the most part they'll climb on walls and ceilings. Then drop down and run at you or lunge a great distance. They can be deadly up close, but a shotgun blast takes them out. The rifles don't feel effective at all. There are acid spitters that stay away while spitting from a far. The lurkers are the intelligent ones. They'll use stealth to attack you. Climb through vents, disappear into the darkness and they take more damage. Then there are the Weyland Yutani soldiers. They can do everything you can do. Flank, hide, reload, shoot and throw a rare grenade your way. They drop random health, ammo and armor.The bosses are big and need you to outsmart them than just taking more damage. You'll fight one in a power loader, you'll outrun one torching all the doors behind you. The bull alien will chase you in circles, letting your allies shoot him in the back. Finally the queen is the most meh battle of them all. So meh I literally could clip through her and speed run the final battle of the game, doing all that was needed of me.For better or worse, the weapons are straight out of the Aliens movie. There is a variety of shotguns, pulse rifles, assault rifles, pistols, flame throwers and even the smart gun that tracks enemies to shoot. Throwable things like grenades are easily forgotten, because they need to be armed like a weapon and can't be quick thrown. To make throwables more forgettable is the fact that most weapons have alt fires. Assault rifles have incinerators, pulse rifles have grenade launchers and even those that don't can be upgraded later. There are a lot of upgrades for each weapon such as scopes, skins, alt fires, clips and so on. They unlock as you rank up from completing 'challenges.' These challenges are things like kill 20 enemies with any rifle. Get 5 melee kills in a single 'mission.' Headshot 5 enemies with the service pistol. They do switch things up, because otherwise I'd use a shotgun through the entire game. Damage > accuracy.By the end of the game you'll have an entire arsenal, complete with weapons found from characters in the movie. Each weapon has its own ammo so if you run empty on one shotgun, the pump handle might still have some shells. Since you have so many weapons, the game makes use of a weapon wheel. Every weapon has its own stats: Damage, accuracy, rate of fire and so on. Shotguns have more damage, but less accuracy. Pulse rifles have less damage, but high rate of fire. The problem is the rate of fire is weak, you can't just hold it. The gunfire will stop, forcing you to play in controlled bursts. The assault rifle will only shoot two bullets at once. Weapons can get upgraded mostly to increase accuracy, clip size and reload. The thing to most take into account is the accuracy stat. You need to aim to shoot with any accuracy. Not just that, because of the accuracy stat, you can shoot things head on and they have a chance of going straight through. To prove that, the game has DLC with a firing range. Aim straight on, fire and sometimes things just go through. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, it might kill you. Speaking of killing you. There is acid blood, but its never enough to kill you, even standing in it on the highest difficulty. What will really kill you is aliens clipping through you. Becoming you so your gun is outside of them. When you fire it will miss, because the alien has clipped through you. Since they can run faster than you. It caused frequent deaths.Its not all guns though. There are a few brief moments where you need to use stealth. First unarmed you'll have to quietly sneak past a new form of blind aliens that explode. Then you'll have to sneak past lights and sentries that will spot and shoot at you.Other glitches have been fixed with some patch a year into the game, but even when they were patched I still noticed glitches that had been fixed were still a problem. Nothing game breaking, just noticeable. Things like an alien coming off a wall and getting stuck in the floor. Getting hit by an alien while shooting only to have the gun still shooting. Texture popin was still here and there, mostly when reloading a level from a death. I guess its a way to speed up load times.The controls are simple for the most part. Aim, shoot, alt-fire, move, look, jump, squat and run. Use the D-pad for flashlight, grenade ready, weapon ready, pistol ready. There's a whole other button to switch between two weapons even if you can hold a dozen or so. Sometimes it didn't feel intuitive, but the game lets you bind keys and controls. While there is melee, it felt useless. Most things on soldier difficulty will easily kill you at close range. You also have a motion tracker, but it only feels useful when I was trying to find the location of the next checkpoint. Sure it tells you where enemy movement is, but when you can't use it and shoot it felt like a handicap. Plus, you hear a sound when you're in range of a new hostile.There is multiplayer, but there's nothing going on at this point without being scheduled. Overall, it was a good experience, even if its not the best first person shooter. While people call it the worst game of all time, it could have been much worse. The end left me with a sour taste. At the end of Star Wars, they blew up the Death Star and that was that. They didn't start the next movie and end it.			"

												Genre - Sci-Fi FPSWell this is a game by Gearbox who bought us Borderlands. So to say I had high hopes would be an understatement. I love the Aliens films and had yet to find a good Aliens game unless there are also Predators involved that is. Unfortunately this game stayed true to form. The story mode is okay and you can play co-op but it is a game on rails (unlike Borderlands). There are upgrades you can earn for multiplayer deathmatch but most of the Aliens vs Marines games I played always ended up being one sided affairs with people just holding key points Zzzzzzzzzzz. Also the story doesn't really make sense (correct me if I'm wrong) when linked to the films. I think with a bit more thought and input from fans of the Aliens franchise this could have been vastly improved. This is a below average game for above average material.			"

												A long awaited game in which you shouldn't expect too much. The graphics engine is really outdated. The Aliens are really buggy (no pun intended) most of the time. And you spend most of your gameplay killing humans or androids. The story is twisted and really bad and should not even be remotely related to the original. ~About the Season pass~Still containing tons of bugs, graphical flaws, and also destroying the storyline even further. The aliens and humans are glithy to no end and the game still looks horrible.Conclusion: Is it worth the money? Absolutely NO! But if you want to laugh at something so horribly excecuted and written. Play it on “Ultimate Badass” diffuculty with a friend and you will have many laughs! Even tho it's like playing on easy.			"

												What can be said about this game already.  It is a huge disaster.  And Randy's continued denial that he lied and this game is a joke just keeps the fuel going.So why did I grab it (on sale of course)?  Because I had to see for it myself.  So here's a list of what you'll get in this game:1: Broken Alien AI2: Broken Alien AI clipped into the walls or floors3: Broken Marine AI4: Broken Marine AI clipped into the walls or floors5: Broken Marine AI that stops in doorways6: Aliens that Spawn right behind your back7: O'Neil8: Textures with words/numbers that upside down and/or backwards9: FanFiction.net quality story10: Terrible animations11: Useless Motion Tracker12: COD Clone13: O'Neil14: Broken / Missing Textures15: O ""Get the hell out of the way!""

												I can't help but feel sad about Alien fans, who paid the full retail price to play this title. I paid $5 and I feel like that was a waste of money, as I didn't even have the desire to finish it. Delete Local Content.... Done. Now I feel better.EDIT: I needed to add some more opinion as people may think I am jumping at conclusions here. The game is a complete mess. Most of the time you don't know where to go or what to do, but the game does indicate friendly positions and you are fooled by following them. Sometimes there are game-breaking bugs, npc's stop responding, things stop happening.Seriously, if you are looking for an Alien game, just play Isolation. This looks like fun, but believe me, you will be frustrated in the end.			"

												After reading the extremely negative reviews here on Steam, I was not really expecting anything when I picked it up in January 2015 for less than 3.5 € (external retailer). I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. As a matter of fact, I even completed the game in short bursts, which is saying a lot if I look at the current state of my game library. ""So, how is the game"" - you ask sceptically? First, forgot all about what the other reviewers here wrote: this game has been patched up so much that nearly all bugs are gone. Team-mates will not block doors, aliens will not walk through you, you will not become stuck, there are no crashes, ... The guy who wrote you only get to operate to power loader exo-suit for 2 seconds obviously got not far into the game, as the suit returns for a boss battle halfway. Seriously, some reviews here - even recent ones! - look like they are talking about a completely different game. What remains is an OK first-person shooter set in the Alien universe. Its best aspects are: Fairly good depiction of the colonial marines and the aliens. Marines operate in teams and that is exactly what you will be doing here. Sounds are excellent, especially the weapon and door SFX that sound like they were taken straight from the movies. Lots of fan-service: you will visit the movie-sets, find tons of easter eggs referring to the movies, music from the movies, ... Picking up the Smartgun had me giggling like a schoolgirl every time. Gameplay is fluently and entertaining, even though very simplistic. It is interesting to see how the game links ""Aliens"" with ""Alien 3"" and beyond. Then again, the game is by no means perfect: It is annoying that almost all aliens zerg straight to you, often completely ignoring your team-mates. Graphics were outdated even on day of release. While some sets are epic, there are also lots of levels that are forgettable and just plain boring. I mean, how many times do we have to walk between near-identical ruined buildings or through caves? The story is fairly rubbish and at some points hard to follow. The ""Weyland Yutani is evil"" card is being played far too much and becomes boring very fast. Difficulty is unbalanced: even the easiest difficulty still includes very high difficulty spikes. One common complaint is that at some point, the alien enemies are replaced by human enemies. That is simply not true: it is correct that about halfway, human enemies are added to the game, but you will be battling aliens until the very end. The aliens also remain the biggest threat at all times, while the humans are mostly pushovers for anyone with even a tiny bit of FPS experience. As to the DLC, most of it is garbage. I only care about the singleplayer part and found that all I needed was the base game + Statis Interrupted. The latter DLC starts of with a nice ""Alien"" vibe (seriously, it is a wonder that the makers of Alien: Isolation were not sued ...), before going back to the ""Aliens"" setting. Its FPS part is even more back-to-basic than the base game. If you prefer slightly more modern FPS gameplay and don't really care about the link between Aliens, Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection, you can just as well skip Statis Interrupted. All in all, I recommend the game to everyone who is even slightly fan of the Alien-universe AND who likes straightforward first-person shooters. No, it is not a horror game. And yes, it is an almost old-school FPS with health packs, point-and-shoot gameplay, secret hunting and not much else. But if that is what you are looking for, you will not be disappointed for 5$/€. However, if you want the ultimate Aliens-experience, I still recommend Aliens vs. Predator 2 over Aliens Colonial Marines any day of the week. "

												This game is a mix of first person shooter and survival horror. Sadly I can't really recommend this game. I had low expectations for this game so I just wanted to go through the story. But even on the easiest level the game is quite tough and very frustrating. A single alien or grenade or head shot can kill you instantly. Although the game supports a controller, you simply can't react quickly enough to survive between checkpoints. I had to play with mouse and keyboard to get through the chapters. I had to replay some scenes again and again learning where the aliens or humans are going to jump out at you. It is like a survival horror game (limited health, ammo and armour) but with tons of enemies that need to be killed to progress. It is mostly a very linear corridor shooter with scripted monster closets. There are 11 missions, but they look and feel very similar.   To me it feels like there is not enough ammo for you to kill all the enemies. So I tend to hang back and watch the AI characters play the game, which is pretty boring. Even on easy the AI characters get killed again and again and again, but luckily they always get up again. My other problem with the game is that it rarely actually feels like the aliens universe. The only good things are the motion tracker, pulse rifle and ending cut scene. They have even invented new types of aliens which just feel very, very wrong. The graphics are OK but are very generic future sci-fi. This is totally at odds with the aliens films which have a very retro sci-fi appearance. I forced myself to finish the game, but basically I did not enjoy it at all. I kept hoping the next chapter would be better, but is never really was. I did try and play multiplayer but I never managed to get a match even though I tried lots of different settings. The DLC is a little bit better and more interesting.			"

												I played this game after finishing Alien: Isolation... there is a gap the size of a planet between the quality of these two games....but Aliens: Colonial Marines is not a bad game. I surley can understand why Xenomorph-Enthusiasts and people who bought into the Hype hate it. The pictures from the Storepage are more or less fake, the Alien-AI is except from some rare scripted behaviour poor and the Story is nothing to write home about. It feels like a game published from a low or medium-tier developer or something scrappy, unattractive standing for ten years in your shelf.But if you can ignore all this and get it for a dicount(75%) than it´s worth the ten hours the campaign may take. It´s a fun mediocre shooter, best played in coop. You may forget everything about it afterwards but just running down a linear path, shooting at dumb Xenos and waves of corporate badguys is something of a guilty pleasure. Also it will give you some untold Alien-Storyline!In short.. don´t expect too much.. 65/100			"

												I've waited for this game since it was first anounced back in I believe 2006, i've seen all the movies, both the theatre versions as the directors cuts like a hundred times and played almost every alien game; Alien Trilogy, the old AVP, AVP 2 and the new AVP and I've played some Alien Ressurection but i couldn't complete it because of some bug.So did i like the game? Kinda. It has some good aspects to it. I really liked the map design of the maps that takes place on LV-426, the maps that take place on the sulaco have some great parts but aren't really that statisfying, they've added a cool new alien called the Spitter, the other new aliens are sh!t (i'm kinda hard to statisfy when it comes to new alien designs) and the weapons are cool, the all of the traditional weapons are there including some new ones that actually aren't that bad, and the weapons used in the movie Aliens can be found as collectibles and I love them all except for Hudsons Pulse Rifle witch is a burst rifle for some reason but the weapon itself looks great. and the Pulse rifle finally sounds like a Pulse rifle, it might not sound like a big deal but to me it actually is. the graphics aren't that great but I don't really mind, I play games not graphics.Besides all the things i just mentioned there isn't much to write home about. the AI can be really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, especialy the AI of the weyland yutani mercenairies, and thats another thing, there are way too many weyland yutani mercenairies. I know fighting other people isn't new to an Alien game, Alien Trilogy and Alien Ressurection had some human enemies in it and AVP 2 also had a level where you had to fight humans, but why so many. there are a few boss battles witch are really, really bad, the ending is terrible. and there's the story, witch has been approved by Fox (probably by some f*cker who couldn't see past the dollar signs in his eye), it's just terrible.So what about coöp and multiplayer,i've heared a lot of people say games are much better when you can play them with your friends, but I liked A:CM more when I played on my own, multiplayer actually was really great, i really enjoyed playing multiplayer but unfortunately it took less than a month before the multiplayer was dead.unfortunatly the game wasn't quite what i expected, I kinda enjoyed playing through the campain once but once that is over there isn't really any fun in it, and the multiplayer was great but now it's dead, therefor I give Aliens: Colonial marines a 4,5/10			"

												Mother of god, this is a bad game. We're talking ""they barely fulfilled their legal obligations with the season pass DLC"" bad. ""We released story DLC as a final patch for the title and abandoned it forever"" bad. ""Game now reboots on an endless loop whenever you close it and Gearbox doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥"" bad.The gameplay's arguably worse. Ever wanted to be a marine who had to grind for weapons IN SINGLE-PLAYER? Seriously, though, you can't carry more than two guns until you start hunting for audio logs or other things to trigger XP gain. That is how bad this gets. It is also, and maybe this is my sucking at FPSes here, just hard in some mean ways. I'm pretty sure some enemies spawn out of midair in certain fights. Even using the motion tracker (hope you like juggling about 6 keys to do anything at a time, by the way) I'd be eviscerated when something was suddenly on top of me. Like, literally on top of me, it came off the roof or from the sky somehow.There's much, much worse in here. Let's not get into how dumb the plot is, or stealth segments where you hide from blind xenomorphs (this is a real thing and the animation is SO BAD), or that the only things you will remember when the game ends are going to basically be ""remember X from the movies? we did that but you're nowhere near as cool as Ripley"".I made a bet with a friend that we'd start this at the same time and see who'd beat it first. She uninstalled it a few levels from the end and never regretted it for an instant: I was much, much stupider to finish the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Don't buy, don't play, do not even think about this game, because it's not even the funny sort of bad, it's the painful, needles in your eyes bad variety, where every level is like pulling teeth. Your own teeth. With a claw hammer.			"

Second, the characters in this game are morons. I dont know much about Aliens series but I was hoping for a game which is better than some other average FPSs. But its not. Dont get me wrong, there are worse FPSs out there (like Day One) and the game has some enjoyable moments but the game itself is crap. Anyway if you planning to buy this crap I recommend to read the Store page reviews first. Dont recommend!			"

												--75% OFF REVIEW--So I got Aliens: Colonial Marines for £2.49 and IT WAS NOT WORTH IT. A few of the reviews are daring to say that this game didn't deserve all the negitive attention but trust me this game is f^cking awful. I'm a huge Alien fan and this thing should be nuked from Orbit! The story is complete sh!t and destroys the Alien universe. I would say its like a bad fan-fiction but that would honestly be an offense to fan-fiction writers. The gameplay makes Call of Duty look like a work of art. The graphics have been patched up a lot but it still doesn't look good. Sound design makes me want to tear my ears off. Voice acting is just terrible and they constantly repeat the same lines. ""WINTER, MOVE!"" AI is god awful and is not fun to play! I finished the game in 4 hours on normal! Multiplayer is dead, the only way to get a game is to join a group and gather people up at set times. Michael Biehn (Corporal Hicks) is 59 years old and not a voice actor so he sounds hilarious. Also his in-game model looks like a bad wax figure. You spend most of the game fighting humans... Weapons look good and fit in the universe but they don't sound or feel good.DON'T BUY THIS			"

												Gonna go the opposite of a lot of reviews here and give a thumbs up to ACM.  That being said I did purchase this during holiday sale off Amazon for $1.99 and several months have passed since relase date.  Gearbox has patched the game up to eliminate and improve some issues.  I can understand people that pre ordered and spent $60 on this game, I would def be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and upset as it is nowhere near worth that money, but for 2 bucks it surely is.  Being a fan of the Alien franchise and growing up in the late 70's/early 80's I can appreciate the tone of this game and the sense of art style seems to be a throwback to that era.  Graphics are terrible by todays standards and what we should be getting, however I thought the Alien models looked really well done and were true to Alien lore.  The sound was failry bad to, mostly the dreadful voice work, the ambient sound and alien hisses were good though.  Gameplay is really straight forward to the tune of run n gun, with a checkpoint save system.  I have certainly played a lot more trash garbage games than ACM and in my opinion should not be labeled as such, just a game that was falsely advertised and was way below potential on a galactic level - BUT if you can pick it up cheap its worth a run through, which I thought was fun and ok.

Despite its undeniable flaws, thank you 20th Century Fox, thank you SEGA, thank you Gearbox Software, thank you TimeGate, thank you very much Demiurge Studios for this game and for its undeniable, manifold, mature & really huge qualities! Congratulations for this nice crossover between James Cameron & Stan Winston 1986 feature film and the Aliens™ 1988-nowadays comics/novels. +1 for the Art direction, TDM & the Bug Hunt DLC!			"

												""Looks like some sort of secreted movie licensed game...""""Secreted from what?"" ""My♥♥♥♥♥""The illegal alien of the alien franchise, Call of Duty: Alien Edition.A bit of a guilty pleasure, but a very disappointing entry to the series. For everything it does right, it does atleast 3 more things wrong. Three examples:The game makes you have to pull out your motion tracker to use it, rendering you unable to fire, but the motion tracker detects infront and behind of you, negating all tension as you don't need to co operate with your teammates at all.You can customize your weapons, making them your own, but you can carry them all with you at any given time, (and even edit them in mid mission!), meaning there is no real strategising in customizing.Ultimate badass difficulty attempts to give you more immersion and atmosphere, which it actually succeeds in doing. Ultimate badass difficulty removes all hud and makes the game more difficult, meaning you have to remember what you do (and don't) have. This goes well with the design and score, but is completely pointless as your teammates can teleport, and the aliens appear to be of a bootleg variety, with no acidic blood (it seems more like they are just spewing lemonade), facehuggers that cannot subdue anything, and aliens that forget they can climb on surfaces and use stealth.The game is also so contrtadicting in it's nature, it gives a ""no marine left behind"" flick, wherein the beginning of the game you and your squad are almost killed due to a fellow marine blowing himself (and others around him) up because a chestburster ripped through him.Or making it that marines don't know what facehuggers are, yet they somehow can identify different types of xenomorphs (even in pitch black).Not great, not bad, just unrelentingly disappointing.If you're looking for a action FPS, go look at AvP, a much better entry, not only allowing you to be a colonial marine, but also a xenomorph or predator.If you're looking for a more true to the series entry, go look at Alien: Isolation, as it gets almost everything right.

												I've been playing this recently with TemplarGFX's ACM Overhaul v3.0 mod installed. Having never played the original unmodded version I can only comment on the modded version I am now playing.I've been playing on ""faster weaker soldier"" mod mode and the game has proven an addictive and satisfying followup to Aliens. The modded Alien AI has proven a wicked challenge and really makes it feel like you're reliving the film. I haven't finished the title yet, but there are a fair amount of bugs left, and another complaint would be the balancing issues that are the result of ACM Overhaul's tweaks. You're sometimes left with too little health or ammo for a ""Normal"" difficulty setting. Some of the alien gameplay definitely needs to be tweaked for optimal playability but I hear things are improving constantly.The story line is relatively straight forward and could have been executed better. The characters are pretty shallow, but this overall it doesn't detract from the game too much.I haven't put down the game since I've started playing and I recommend it to fans and non-fans alike with the ACM Overhaul mod installed. It looks like it's finally given this game the justice it deserved from a rushed release. If you, like me had only played Alien: Isolation and avoided this title due to the stigma then do what I did and you won't be dissapointed.			"

BAM... forced restart, no time to save open programs, nothing... upon booting into Windows, blue background, no icons displayed, no task-bar, nothing, same message, BAM... restart... Safe Mode... can't uninstall or disable .NET setup... back to normal, I could start Task Manager, launch explorer.exe and kill .NET setup, find its directory on C:\, completely remove it, restart and... phew, now the infinite error - restarts don't occur anymore.Seriously, this piece of sh*t game is not worth destroying your PC for it... also, whenever I exited the game, it always got launched automatically again... you'd have to be a ninja to quickly cancel the launch operation through Steam whenever you exited this piece of sh*t game.Totally not worth the bother, a piece of sh*t, don't even get it if they pay you all the money in the world for it!

												Usually I'm a connoisseur in games and I'd give a long review describing why this game is bad. But for some reason, this game has a mysterious way of being bad. Everything was right, the story plot, FPS, aliens, and so on. But amazingly, it's♥♥♥♥♥♥ Combat is♥♥♥♥♥♥ story would have been good but is somehow♥♥♥♥♥♥ it just has an overwhelming talent of being boring! How can someone make such a classic storyline so boring!?!? That takes a special kind of talent. I've played the old (and I mean OLD) AVP and AVP2, and they were both pretty good games. But this one has really taught me that even one of the best plots can be ruined by lousy game design.			"

												★★☆☆☆ - ""Average at best, Id give it a miss"" PROS:- Very nice design true to the style of the movie and capture their essence very well.- Great sound, the guns, the aliens and even better with surround sound.- Fairly satisfying shooting.- Nearly every weapon has secondary attachments which are fun to let off.- The puddles are amazing in this game, seriously.CONS:- Pathetically lame and predictable storyline which is completely uninteresting.- Repetitive missions, saving the sorry asses of marines constantly.- Awful voice acting and generic script which is totally unimaginative. - Boring and stereotypical characters, which you feel nothing but hate for.- Dated graphics.- Can kill the aliens too easily, they went for action and quantity over tension and quality.- I found my experience riddled with bugs, usually off the back of completing something and it totally skipping an animation or cut scene, breaking any immersion you have.- Short single player, although not entirely a bad thing in this case.VERDICT? A very average game which is not acceptable for a AAA game with its potential. AvP and Isolation are both better options.			"

												There seems to be a lot of negative reviews for this game, but I for one, enjoy(ed) it; for both the nostalgia of the alien franchise and the continuation of story from my favorite alien movie: aliens (the 2nd of the quadrilogy). I do want to mention however, that I bought this game on sale for $1.99 and after many of the patches that fixed the early glitches, which made playing through the story mode pleasant. The graphics are OK, but could be better. The gameplay can be sometimes unforgiving, but once you get the hang of it (don't let the aliens sneak up on you), you'll increase your odds of staying alive. Soundtrack: awesome. Story: great. A lot of people complained about the story in this game as well, but I think they forget that this is based off a simple action movie. If you want more story, play a game that ties into aliens 3 (definitely more drama and story driven) than the action driven Aliens 2. All in all, for $1.99, I have no regrets and I'm glad I purchased and played the game that brought back many good alien killing memories.			"

												The development process behind this game was interesting.interesting as in gearbox hired TimeGate a different devlopment studio to do the work for them. At the last moments of development gearbox took over and rushed the final stages of the game. This is evident.and it's not hard to tell who did what. Timegate knew what they were doing. They worked with the alien ai they created. They created claustrophobic levels with many walls and tight spaces and COVER for the aliens to utilise. This was great and i found myself getting overwhelmed and flanked quite often.but gearbox, tsk tsk tsktheir level design was near identical to their game borderlands (also the reason they weren't working on acm)Too many open spaces, not enough walls, not enough cover. The aliens didnt know what to do with it. And you would find them hiding behind nonexistent cover because all the rest of the little cover available was occupied by the other aliens. And this is why the would act stupid and rush into your bullets.its the same for graphics too. Early game there are plenty of dark, similar coloured crevices for the aliens to hide in and particle effects are abundant. But late game the aliens stick out like sore thumbs also contributing to their inability to flank late gameBut since the patches the game doesn't look too bad, its pretty good actually. There are still minor hiccups in the companion's ai as well but overall this games actually quite enjoyable.I just wish timegate got to develop the whole thing. im giving a positive review because timegate did a great job. This thumbs up goes their way.if I could though I would also leave a negative review saying Gearbox sucks.gearbox was that one guy who doesn't help with group project until the last minute and drags everyones grades down to a C with their crappy contribution.also, I feel like the majority of the negative reviews are just bandwagoning.

												I actually first owned this game on the Xbox 360, it was a huge disappointment and possibly the worst edition. It was downright buggy and just comlete false advertisment of what the developers promised in E3 that year. Screw you Gearbox. Original demo gameplay which should of been the gameplay but wasn't.


YouTube™ Video: Aliens: Colonial Marines  - E3 2011: 11-Minute Live Demo Walkthrough 

			Views: 114,357		

			CEO Randy Pitchford freaks out that his Gearbox Software is making a proper follow-up to the Aliens movies in Aliens: Colonial Marines. Enjoy an 11-minute walkthrough of the E3 2011 demo.		

I bought the PC version on a whim, only because I had extra cash to burn. I played the PC version about a year later after the release of launch date. They did patch the game and with slightly better graphics. Still not as good as the suppose demo of the game but at least it was better than on launch.The graphics are passable but at times the game texture looks like a late stage PS2 or original Xbox game. Even with the improvements, the game still looks a bit choppy. The controls are actually very solid, mind you I played with mouse/keyboard. The enemy AI was improved from launched but still needs work.The gameplay on this game is just average and you don't really feel any tension like you should when playing a game like this. What I really didn't like about this game was half of the stages you are fighting Wayland mercs instead of aliens. Even Aliens vs Predator (2010) did a better job of this when you played the marine. Multiplayer co-op is at least fun but I would crank it up to the highest difficulty to get the most out of it. The game is rather short and the storyline is forgettable. As for online multiplayer matches, it's pretty much dead unless you find a Steam group or have a good amount of friends to play with.I would not buy this game unless you really really like Aliens or have friends to play with. If you are undecided, I would wait until it goes on sale for $5.Overall I would have to rate this game a 5/10, even with the improvements and patches.			"

												I do not understand what all of the negativity is about.  Check it out.I would like to clear some things up for future buyers.  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and elbows.Quick Note:  Install TemplarGFX Mod, makes things REALLY BADASSMy background:- Longtime Alien fan, I saw Aliens about a year after it came out and it scared the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me as a kid - Enormous FPS player, played almost every FPS since Wolfenstein 3D (early 90s)- Big Bethesda player and I think all FPS should use the Fallout/Skyrim systems (by law!)- Former military with actual weapons, tactics, and combat experience- Sergeant Apone is still my favorite military leaderGame Review (short and to the point, express elevator):This feels a lot like the Doom remake of the early 2000s.  If you are looking for Skyrim or Fallout controls, you will be disappointed.  If you are looking for interactive environments, you will be disappointed.  This is a very linear FPS which is on a determined track to tell a story.  You will not be creating your story, but you will be following the story that is laid out as you go along.  There are no saves, so you have to reach those checkpoints.  There is no character creation.  There is no skill upgrading and there are only limited weapons upgrades.  The Aliens move and act just like the movies, they come rushing relentlessly, spin around walls, and give slight holds or retreats...just like in the movies.  The studio did a fair job in creating the alien and marine behaviors.  I read another review which apparently did not take the movies into effect.  Again, they applied the movie rules to the game.  The graphics, feel, and physics are definitely dated for its release time, but they are not bad at all.  It's all about perspective.  The soundtrack is awesome.  James Cameron should use this game's soundtrack to replace the Aliens soundtrack.  If you are used to superior games then you will be disappointed.  If you love Aliens, then you will love this game.  Just try to approach it from a reasonable point of view.They need to rework the characters and make them more military-like.  The character, Bella, should be deleted.  She looks and acts like she just came back from a Bayou rave party.  The ""cool character"" crap is so not USCM.  Really?  A USCM with fashionable neckband, makeup, no helmet, and pigtail buns!  The Colonial Marines that everyone loves in the movies were trained by actual SAS operatives and the Sergeant Apone actor (actual Vietnam Marine Combat Veteran with 2 purple hearts).  This is why people love the Colonial Marines, they gave the believable appearance of hardcore, but often jackass, military personnel, with even leadership flaws. It's definitely worth the reduced price and I do agree that the original price and hype was fraudulent.  It's worth a one time go.I'm going to play some more.  In the pipe, 5 x 5!			"

												Aliens: Colonial Marines takes a popular IP and converts it into a soulless and dull shooter that continually mugs for the camera but lacks anything that made the movie great.  On a technical level, the game is plagued by graphics that looked dated on release, lazy and reused maps which include warping to the next location when the developers apparently gave up on adding hallways, guns that are no fun to use and the lamest fire/explosion effects I've seen in a game in a long while.  Beyond that, the plot is dull and often asinine, the NPCs you'll be saddled with the whole game do nothing to endear themselves and the bullet-sponge enemies make the combat a dull plod rather than the tight action you saw when the Colonial Marines first delved into the underbelly of Hadley's Hope in Aliens.  Oh, that's when you're actually fighting xenomorphs since you'll spend at least equal time shooting Weyland-Yutani mooks who are as impervious to bullets as the aliens.  Throughout you'll see locations from the Aliens film, find 'legendary' weapons named after characters (that are worse than your stock weapons), see film characters as NPCs and discover Easter eggs but all of it feels like ""Eh? EH? See how this is an Aliens game? See??"" rather than immersing you in it.There really isn't anything to recommend about this game.  There's better shooters and better games for capturing the Aliens experience.  This probably won't be the worst game you've ever played but rather one of the more disappointing.			"

I immediately recognized the characters and especially the buildings I saw in the movie.The story connects directly after the movie, when a second team of marines answer to a distress call from Cpl. Hicks, one of the survivors of the movie.The story is simple. You are a marine and there are aliens. There are also evil humans you should ""only fire at when fired upon"". Those orders stand for almost full 10 seconds!It is very fast paced and the AI isn't too challenging. The aliens are not that good at hiding and prefer a simple assault, which makes them the inferior race. On some occasions the game has a little twist which made me quite enjoy it. Some sneeky parts for example where funny, especially in Coop.I played it with 2 of my friends on Hardened difficulty and we managed to finish it in about 6 hours.Some of the menus are quite hidden and I would've loved to play an alien campaign.All in all solid. Too bad there are no multiplayer games any more.			"

												Since release a lot of things got updated. Textures are better, Alien AI got improved.The Story didn`t change of course, but when you play it coop, you can have a very good time.Escpecially the level, where you have to sneak through the sewerage ;) This is a very intense cooperative experience.And the DLC: Stasis Interrupted is the real gap-filler for the movies Alien 2 and 3. Here the levels have a good design and the story is good enough for a recommendation. The background sound is great, and let`s you feel like in the first Alien movie.After all these upgrades and with the DLC in special, this game is nowadays underrated in my opinion.			"

												Oh man.... This game.To be fair..... I DID buy this on sale knowing it had recieved terrible reviews. I decided to give it a go anyways because I guess I had to see for myself exactly how bad it truely was. So this is my literal 25 something minutes of playing this absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥game.Start the game and have a feel for the controls for the first time. I was getting use to the iron sights and started customizing the controls to better fit my liking. I discover a marine all snotted up on the wall, telling me to cut him down.  The cutscene plays of my character using his torch to cut this guy down. I hear the alien making noises during the cutscene and the alien just crawls up next to my character FNAF style and grabs my hand, then hisses.  The alien then glitches out on the wall spinning around in a circle allowing me to shoot and kill him really easily.... Lets just say that wasn't a very good first impression. Something I was supposed to expect in future battles im guessing.....So we reach a landing bay area where there is a big dropship sitting in the center. Theres two Aliens on top of some cargo containers next to the drop ship. There were also TWO marines, 1 with a smart gun and the other with a pulse rifle behind some cargo crates shooting at them. The person I had cut down decides the best corse of action is to throw a grenade at the ship...... Seriously? For two aliens you think to throw a grenade when you could have just shot them. The grenade blew up the whole drop ship..... It was such a stupid plot idea that Sega should be sued for writing such a terrible plot line.After I save the day with about 45 seconds of none stop aliens runing towards us while some idiot marine tries to unlock some door behind me. We finally set back off back to where we started this♥♥♥♥♥♥mess of a game. While traveling down this weird long space hallway..... The marine that I had cut down earlier starts having his predictable spaz attack before the chest burst. And im sitting here thinking. OK....The alien is going to pop out and run off towards the Marine's ship or something. NOPE! The Dude Alu akbarz himself with a grenade. Completly destroying the bridge and killing like 2 other marines with me..... You and some other loser survies the blast. Say some corny♥♥♥♥♥♥to each other, and I quit the ♥♥♥♥ing game out of RAGE.The end? No! You see.... After I quit the game, it had started itself right back up again! Steam kept telling me that it was ""running AVP"" and would launched the game every time I would try to quit. Took me 4 times just to be fast enough to click ""delete local content""This game is a ♥♥♥♥ing virus. I do hope whoever was in charge of this games devolopment was fired and sued for the companys losses.			"

												This game gets alot of flak, but honestly, I think it is what I call 'Duke Nukem Forever Syndrome' in action. The game took so long to release, was so hyped every step of the way and every change in developer, and was so rabidly sought after from the moment it was announced to be in the works that it was doomed to bad press the instant the overhype and anticipation were not 100% sated. People expected a masterpiece of modern gaming based in the Aliens universe, what they got instead was a decent example of more old-school shooter style gaming based in the Aliens Universe. Not the greatest, but good none-the-less and fun. Sadly seems too many people overlook that in favor of complaining that its not the Alpha-male of a game they expected.The story, while full of the passing plot hole here and there if your a devoted enough Aliens fan to even notice them, is par for the course when it comes to Alien franchise games. The conrols work, the xenos are relentless when they appear, Weyland-Yutani corp are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and so are their mercs, and the multiplayer is fun as hell and lets you play as both Aliens and Marines with upgradable weapons and evolutions and unlockable costume bits for cosmetic appeal.Gameplay is the older shooter style when your marines, no cover-shooter mechanics here just straight up crouch and shoot logic where anything you can fit fully behind is your cover if it stops bullets or buys you a few seconds to reload while swarms of xenos decend onto you. Yeah I said stop bullets, good ol Wey-Yu has sent mercs to secure the place and elimate you pesky and nosey UMC Marines and while alot of people complain about that I point out the following: EVERY ALIEN GAME AT SOME POINT HAS HUMANS KILLING OTHER HUMANS. Why? See above: Weyland-Yutani Corp is a♥♥♥♥♥♥and Mr. Yutani himself is the biggest♥♥♥♥♥♥of all. Don't Beleive me? google the dude and look up his track record in the various games, movies, comics, and books. He is a horrible person...well...android who body jumps from andriod to andriod whenever he dies anyway because he is such a troll with such a need to contiue to troll that he uploaded his brain before dying into a computer and downloads himself into androids to make himself immortal to troll the rest of mankind for eternity.That there is the best in-universe reason to kill humans in this game there is. And its a good reason. Because ♥♥♥♥ Wey-Yu.Unfortunatly the multiplayer, which imo is AMAZING to play, is kinda dead. No one plays it so you can never find a match, but maybe someday it will come back. Even without it the singleplayer is fun and can get your heart pounding in spots, and for the first time in any aliens game the smartgun is not only 100% visually accurate with 100% accurate sound effects, but you get the propper smartgun eyepiece that tracks and highlights moving targets in range for you and auto-targets them based on whichever is closest to the crosshairs...just like the movie. That alone is a Plus even if you only use the thing once because until you run out of ammo and have to dump it you feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥ You feel like your right in the movie when they break that bad boy out and its cutting down xenos by the dozens.Another great feature for single player is the motion tracker. It picks up ALL motion in its range not just living things, again just like in the films, and nothing will startle you more when its been far too quiet for far too long when that thing starts to ping because it picked up some phantom signal from a bit of shifting debris or a swinging cable. And nothing makes your heart thump and set you into panic mode like suddenly having the thing go into overdrive, making you pull it up to see what the hell is going on, then see just a massive blob of dots moving closer on the tracker but nothing in the hallway. Because you know its real that time, thats xenos not some random false reading, theres alot of them, they are close, and most teriffying is that you cant see them. So you start to backpeddle and pray they come out of the vents in small  numbers instead of all at once and that its not right in your face.And thats why I love this game, its everything an aliens game should be and nothing more. Its suspensful, atmospheric, heartpounding, and surprisingly immersive if you can get over some of the flatter voice acting bits in otherwise tense moments. You feel like a UMC Marine caught in a life or death surival situation with only a few people to help you out at best, only yourself more often then not, and your in over your head. But your a marine you have your duty to finish the mission AND get your♥♥♥♥♥and the asses of as many fellow marines as you can back home when your done.No one said life in the UMCM was a glorious one, and its a bughunt down there. But damn is it an exciting and Fun life.			"

												Note: Single Player campaign only.""Not the worst game ever."" - about the best thing I can possibly say about it.  Actually, the music reasonably emulates the James Horner score from the movie... at times; in a made for tv sequel kind of way.If you ignore all the pre-release footage, trailers, PAX demos, vertical slices, bull-shots, and interviews with passionate developer/aliens fans, you can have yourself a perfectly mediocre 12 hour romp.  Is it better than un-offical duke or doom mods that I've played?  No.  Is it worth $10?  No.   Is this review 2 1/2 years late?  Yes.  I just felt compelled to post it with the recent comments about certain people being ""proud"" of this game.Spoiler alert - The game ends on a cliff hanger for the DLC.  Not the good kind of cliff hanger that leaves you wanting to know ""what happens next?"", talking about it for weeks, discussing with fellow gamers what happens after the 'exciting' conclusion.  No, this is the kind that gets answered for the low low price of $10 just 6 months later because they chopped off/shipped the game before the last 20% of the game was completed to sell as DLC, it contains the answers to the questions raised by the game's ""story"", and a majority of Michael Biehn's in-game appearance.It's a better condemnation of the videogame industry than a videogame.  Save your money, or better yet, spend it on something that deserves it./edit:  you can now only buy the DLC in one large bundle, not individually.  ""Aliens Colonial Marines Collection""			"

												First off I sort of understand the vitriol aimed at the game, it SHOULD have been MUCH better. It's got flaws (but what game hasn't), it had a dodgy develpment (so do many games), a dodgy story and it was rushed out the door (also like many games). Luckily I didn't buy it full price and got it for PC not the shoddy console version (many of the games issues are probably because they couldn't get it running on console so had to drop volumetric fog and most lighting effects). On that basis I DO recommend the game, but NOT to mega FPS fans, there's better FPSs out there. But, if you're a huge Aliens fan and would enjoy walking around the Sulaco's hanger..see Bishops legs and the airlock that the queen was flushed out of (albeit a tad small) you'll enjoy the game for that reason. The gameplay mechanics are wooden and simple point and shoot with a few variations, I enjoyed the smart gun section (but would have liked the option to keep it, for balance the game could have doubled or tripled the enemy count), I enjoyed exploring the Derelict, walking around the ""Gunner"" from Alien was pretty damn cool! The sounds are all there, motion tracker..Pulse rifle etc. When you have the motion tracker you can't shoot so there's a bit of tension there. Ultimately as a gamer I'd give it 5/10, but as an Alien/Aliens fan I give it 2 more points for a respectible 7/10. The game is an example of most of the flaws of the gaming industry and some pretty shoddy decisions and practises (but similar stuff is going on in other industries ALL the time anyway). Oh and one tip...do NOT turn the gamma/brightness up, keep the game DARK and the lighting and atmosphere is much improved....Eurogamer did a comparison of the game v the demo and part of the problem was the brightness on the finshed game in their vid was WAY too high.

2016 UPDATE:Alien Day 4-26 (LV-426) happened, saw Jim Sterling play ACM... and I felt like a revisit of this game!The game is still a big turd... BUT, thanks for TemplarGFX overhaul mod (Google it!)... GAME CHANGER MOD! Lots of improvements (visuals, improved A.I., 5 times to use SmartGun, fewer clippings, etc)! I played the 4.5 version and I've enjoyed my second playthrough of ACM much more!ACM with TemplarGFX mod RATING: 6.5 / 10STASIS INTERRUPTED DLC:Three stories intertwined by three different characters and each offer a distinct story set before the ACM beginning. Aside from the story and characters, you don't have anything new. But the gameplay is pretty much worth it though.RATING: 6.0 / 10REVISED REVIEW:Aliens: Colonial Marines was in development for at least SIX years. A game that I kept on my radar very closely and been monitoring its development progress. And even after reading the multitudes of bad reviews, I still kept that Collector's Edition preorder from the UK, hoping that the game could still be fun... right? NOPE! BIG PILE OF DUNG IT IS!Aliens vs. Predator 2010 was lackluster and disappointing but NOTHING compared to ACM! How could a game be released in such a bad state especially after the impressive 2011 PRESS GAMEPLAY DEMO?PROS:+Decent shooting (the action is fun).+Music, Sounds and the Ambiance like the films (most sounds are authentic from Aliens).+Tried the MP quickly and it's possibly the only good thing about the game.+Exploring the USS Sephora / USS Sulaco and Hadley's Hope colony was a good fan service from the developers, +Weapons Upgrade systemCONS:-PATHETHIC A.I. Aliens, humans and the O'Neil NPC are atrocious.-Using the M56 SmartGun for about 10 minutes in the whole campaign. -Weak campaign story problems/inconsistencies.-Dated graphics. -Contextual situations (these pre-rendered ""autoplay"" animation that you don't have any control over your character (activating switches, etc). I've died a few times already on the game because of that lame mechanic).OVERALL:Gearbox & other developers & SEGA lied to fans and released a rushed product whose development got changed a few times until SEGA ordered release. Buy cheap and play with TemplarGFX Mod!VERDICT:Gearbox outsourced ACM to other studios. Shady development and using SEGA's money to develop Borderlands 2 means ACM got facehugged. Gearbox messed up real bad! At least, thanks to TemplarGFX MOD, this game is worthy of a revisit! GET ACM CHEAP THOUGH!RATING:4.5 / 10 "

Aliens: Colonial Marines ReviewA:CM picks up roughly seventeen weeks after Ripley, Newt, Hicks and half of android Bishop escape LV-426. A full platoon of marines aboard the US Sephora, responding to Hicks’ distress call, arrive to find the Sulaco back in orbit over the part-terraformed world, despite records (and David Fincher’s Alien 3) asserting its appearance above prison planet Fiorina ""Fury"" 161. It’s this mystery that forms the basis for much of the plot: how did the Sulaco get back to LV-426 – and why?Problems are further compounded when a private military company under the employ of Weyland-Yutani shows up and starts bombarding the Sephora, eventually leading to an emergency crash-landing on the wind-blown surface of LV-426. Weyland-Yutani have established a military presence on the planet, and they’re dug-in deep.In the game you play as Corporal Chris Winter, a hardened marine who ticks all the hero-boxes. He’s honourable, courageous, chiseled, and never leaves a man behind. The first half of the story sees Winter and his surviving crew – grizzled smart-gunner O’Neal, do-or-die CO, Cruz, and less than heroic pilot Reid – trying to find a way to rid mouthy veteran Bella of, shall we say, an unplanned pregnancy. The second half is more action-oriented, as the die-hards attempt to steal the PMC frigate and get the hell off a planet overrun with Xenomorphs.The biggest issue I have with A:CM is that it still thinks it’s 1986 where the script is concerned. Films have come a long way in the last quarter-century, games far more so, and what amounts to a lot of manly posturing, air-punching and swearing doesn’t make for a great plot. That said, what this game presents as a storyline is certainly no better or worse than its source material, but it lacks the instant quotability – but then so do Gears of War or Call of Duty. People expecting Colonial Marines to have the same level of quote-tastic impact as Aliens are going to be disappointed, but it’s an unfair demand. The story is fit for purpose, and though it lacks gravitas and emotional depth, it’s an action yarn, not Shakespeare.Likewise, I’ve rarely seen such attention to detail, not just in the guns and armour and vehicles, but in the world itself. Gearbox deserve a great deal of credit for their interpretation of Hadley’s Hope. I got chills when I entered the MedLab to find the remains of Hudson’s wasted Facehugger, or reached Operations to see the hole in the floor that he was pulled through some time later. The colour palette, the art style, and the detail is impressive, and I felt immersed in Cameron’s world, even if at times the bugs and glitches seemed determined to pull me out.As a shooter, Colonial Marines just about succeeds. The shooting is decent enough, guns are easy to aim precisely and pack enough impact – and there are certainly enough of them; a robust arsenal including pulse rifles, flamethrowers and shotguns alongside “legendary” armaments like Gorman’s service pistol or Hicks’ pump-action fill out a good-sized weapon wheel. Controlling Winter can feel a little loose at times, however, with little sense of size and weight.You’ll face two main enemy types throughout the campaign. The first are Wey-Yu’s mercenary squads, identikit bullet-fodder with the brains of wind-up toys whose presence lowers Colonial Marines to the levels of a Medal of Honor clone, complete with bad AI and no flanking capabilities. Gunfight areas are set up with obvious cover and little imagination, and it’s during these sections that Gearbox’s game hits its lowest points.The other enemy is the legendary Xenomorph itself, and the biggest mistake Gearbox make – and they aren’t the first to do so – is to assume that the titular bug is the ideal enemy for an FPS. Here’s the problem: the alien itself is a creeping, stalking predator that rarely kills outright. The propagation of their species relies on taking prey alive. In the movie they stage only two all-out attacks, the first against the auto-guns, the second against the strung-out survivors. Both have a purpose, and the second sees most of the remaining cast dead, wounded or taken in minutes. Translating a creature that can go from lethal stalker to full-on zerg should be easy in a game – but it isn’t in a shooter. Instead, the Xenos drop in front of you and charge, ready to be blown away with ease. When their AI does allow them to scale walls and use the ceiling to get the drip on you, it leads to them either ineffectively slapping you or a “mash E to live” moment that rarely changes. Invincible team-mates who you can shoot through don’t help the immersion either.Even when you’re outside, Colonial Marines feels like a corridor shooter. You’re never challenged to use the terrain or the environment, and barely need to use your brain to get out of any situation.  Two of the three “boss” fights are incredibly easy, but one is a nightmare given that the enemy AI is set to repeatedly charge you head-on. The new alien types, Boilers (who explode when startled) and Lurkers (who, well, lurk) add an element of ingenuity to proceedings but bring nothing special to the table. It’s just another example of how Gearbox have gone all out on nailing the look and sound of the universe, but completely failed to replicate the tension and complexity of the source material.Aliens: Colonial Marines contains four different Multiplayer Modes - Team Deathmatch, Extermination, Escape, Survivor. Each mode allows one team to play as the United States Colonial Marines and one team as the Xenomorphs. After the time limit has been reached, players switch side and play the game mode once more on the same map.As is now standard, playing either on online or campaign grants XP and raises levels, allowing you to customise your marine and alter his loadout to suit your style. For many, the multiplayer will be the saving grace, but it’s not without its problems. One issue is that some of the maps are too claustrophobic. In the campaign it’s acceptable; in multiplayer it’s not, as you’re often stuck behind a team-mate or a piece of scenery and you get nobbled by a plucky Xeno player. There’s fun to be had online but, like the campaign (even with its drop in, drop out co-op) it’s not enough to raise your pulse.Colonial Marines took me a little over 10 hours to run through on Soldier difficulty (including the DLC campaign), so it's pretty short story-wise. If you’re the sort who has to 100% every game, there are extra hours to be had in finding all the audio logs, dog tags and legendary weapons, but most will bang through the campaign in a few sittings and then play around in the multiplayer.VERDICT: A lot of people will want to hate Aliens: Colonial Marines, and Gearbox don’t do a lot to prevent that, but there are glimmers of a fine game in there. The story is hammy, but I was entertained for every minute that I played; the shooting mechanics don’t do the universe any justice, but those are the limitations imposed by the genre. That’s no excuse of course, but until someone realises that Aliens is not the perfect fit for the FPS genre that it arguably should be, this is what we’ll be stuck with.For dedicated fans this is almost a no-brainer, and there are moments that elevate above the throwaway dross that it occasionally stoops to become. An unarmed chase through the sewers and a tense (if quite easy) climax are highlights, and the multiplayer has legs, but if you’re looking for the definitive Aliens experience, you won’t find it here. Which is a shame, because there were times when I felt genuine goosebumps as I wandered the halls of Hadley’s Hope. Ultimately, though, this really is just another bug hunt.Rating: 6.5/10 "

Granted the 4gb update kinda made a difference but not much should have been worked on more. I must say for a so called "" Crappy/Shiity/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Game"" and despite the Metascore it got.

												A game that could have been so much more... Aliens: Colonial Marines had the right ingredients to do something great, an official license to use all the original material from the films and a studio developing it with a rich history in making action packed games.The results however are horrible. The initial and much talked about gameplay preview that was first shown turned out to be a glorified pre-rendered cinematic and the end result what we have now looks nothing like what was promised. The graphics are average at best and the game is ridden with bugs and glitches even after many patches.The story is crap and does nothing good with the original material. The gameplay seems uninspired and linear, the enemy AI is ridiculously bad and the so called co-op is downright laughable. I think the only thing that turned out okay was the sound and the music but even that can't help the complete lack of atmosphere and originality in this game.I honestly can't recommend this for any price. If you want to play a much better game that actually does something worthwhile with the original movie license, check out Alien: Isolation instead and just forget that this was ever made.			"

												Despite all the bad reviews and catastrophic launch of this game, there is still some fun to have here, mainly the references to the Alien movies especially Aliens aside from that the story is bad, the gameplay is kinda weak and the visuals are lacking but if you are a hardcore Aliens fan you probably picked this one up day one and regretted it xD Anyway after the dust has settled over this I can actually recommend you give it at least a shot and see what all the negative fuzz was all about.

												It's not hard to see where this game has failed, I sincerily wanted it to be good. I'm a huge Alien(s) fan and I hoped to God that this game would be good, but gearbox really messed it up ( or did they ? ). After all, we will never know why this game turned out so horribly, maybe we will. I recommend this game only for >10 bucks/euros or lower. No more. Also, aside from the Bug Hunt DLC, don't buy any other ones, it's pointless since the matchmaking system is dead. Pros:>Amazing audio/sound track>Iconic locations from the movies (ex: Hadley's Hope, Sullaco)>Hicks is in it ( for me it feels awesome to battle xenos alongside people from the Aliens 1986 movie)Cons:>Awfull AI>Horrible story + ending ( don't even get me started on the final boss battle)>Overpowered marines + too much gear/ammo at once>Co-op/Multiplayer is pretty much dead (you only have to have a lot of friends to play this)>STUPID ALIENS (XENOS)>outdated graphics (for 2013 standards, AvP 2010 looks better IMO )If you find yourself in a steam sale and this is for under >10, get it. If not, avoid it at all costs. Alien: Isolation is going to come out soon, that game looks promising (hopefully).			"

												I'm going to barely recommend it just for the multiplayer component, tho it should've been free to play at this point. Get the game for the price of a burger off an alternative source, just to see what it was all about.Pros:-Bug Hunt clearly takes the cake-PVP can actually be fun and worth your time-Some decent vistas-Original cast members (what a waste tho)Cons:-Too many to mentionThe campaign is not fun (and barely so with friends), the story DLC is boring and equally bad. It's unfortunate, but that's what it is. Good thing Alien Isolation sort of relieved a lot of our pain...There is little left for me or anyone to say about this notoriously bad product. We all know Gearbox outsourced money and staff to their Borderlands project instead of delivering on their deal with Sega, we all know they half-a$$ed it and left us with a steaming pile of overly scripted, bug and glitch ridden, badly written and animated, poorly paced and messily stitched-together game. It's sad, because we were wanting something great, and it certainly had potential.			"

												Aliens CM is a disappointment. The promotion trailers for the game showed that you were in for a quick, fast paced, adrenaline ride campaign. Sadly the campaign is the complete opposite. Slow, boring with no real drive for you to keep playing. It's a shame really because at times you can see what this game could have been. The environments look like Aliens, the game sounds like Aliens, but it doesn't feel like Aliens. It felt like I was playing a Nintendo 64 game.			"

												Understand that I am only recommending this game under the following circumstances:1.  You HAVE to be a fan of the Aliens franchise to enjoy this game.2.  You HAVE to have played this years after its release to get the updates that actually make it playable.3.  You HAVE to buy it on sale to make it worth your while.I could never have recommended this game when it launched.  I dropped $60 on it for Xbox 360 and took it back to Gamestop less than a week later.  However, the PC version is slightly (ever so slightly) less offensive.  The game itself takes place after the events that took place in the second film.  It has its ususal Xenomorph jump scares and the evil Wayland-Yutani corporation screwing everyone over for a profit.  It's an average to below average FPS that fans of the franchise will really enjoy.  If you don't like Aliens, then don't even bother, but if you are like me, then pick it up for some good nostalgic fun.			"

												If your a fan of the series you'll enjoy the single player and multiplayer, but the game is a heavy disappointment. If it's not bought during a sale you are getting ripped off. AVP was a much better game over all, but this game's only saving grace is both the easter eggs and the nostalgia of the characters, not to mention the return of a very well recived character.5.5/10 It's playable, and patches helped but the game remains very underwhelming and seems more like Call of duty meets the alien world. The screenshots you see are not as good as in game. The aliens are very boxy movement adn the graphics are no where near E3 trailer.PS, silencers are usesless do not use them, you will reduce you damage and aliens will detect you no matter what.			"

												Aliens: Colonial Marines (A:CM) was built to be a direct sequel to James Cameron's motion picture, Aliens. Despite bad reviews, I enjoyed A:CM, but I am admittedly an Alien fanatic dating from the original film. The game brings back Michael Biehn and Lance Henriksen to reprise their roles in the universe making it feel like an authentic Alien experience. However, A:CM feels like it should be a story-driven singleplayer game, but features multiplayer, player rankings and challenges that fit in as an afterthought. It should be noted that A:CM features a broke Steam Cloud that may result in saved game corruption as your ranking is not stored on Gearbox's servers.			"

												8 out of 10: Worth buying on sale, but needs to be played co-op, and needs the Stasis Interrupted DLC in order to make sense of the storyThe bad rap this game got upon launch was well deserved, and I can understand why so many people are down on it.  I wouldn't let that stop you from buying it, though.  The big patch released by Gearbox really did help the graphics and AI issues a lot, and made the game much more playable.  I only played a bit of the campaign in SP, but found it pretty lackluster; overall it wasn't scary or even tense, and had nothing on the previous Aliens games.  But the game really started to shine in the co-op multiplayer.  It was actually a lot of fun working through the campaign with a couple friends, as well as the Bug Hunt DLC.  As for the story - a lot of people had problems with it, me included.  It really made no sense and had several glaring plot holes that actually made me mad at a couple points.  However, the Stasis Interrupted DLC actually did an admirable job of bringing the plot together and explaining the holes, and I ended up being pretty pleased with the story overall.  I don't know whether all that was originally planned, or whether there was some mad scrambling at Gearbox to try and explain things, but it's too bad you had to play through the whole game, then play the DLC just to have the story make any kind of sense.  All in all, it's worth playing if you have 2 or 3 friends and are willing to shell out for the DLC.			"

												I bought this through the Humble Bundle store for $3.75, meaning that only 90% of what I paid for it went down the drain instead of 100%I bought it to play through it FOR SCIENCE! after having played it at launch with a friend. This recent playthrough is ten hours of my life I'll never get back, and yes, ten sounds like a lot, but it was really only so much because I kept dying from bugs and glitches, like xenomorphs clawing me through indestructible obstacles and suicidal mercenaries that charge me with explosives. Two years after release, its gone from a mostly broken and buggy, poorly designed game with terrible AI to a fairly broken and buggy, poorly designed game with terrible AI. Not quite as terrible as at launch, but a turd doesn't become any less of a turd just because you put a cherry on top of it, it just ends up being a waste of a cherry. All the hours spent patching this game and creating its DLC would've been better spent by Gearbox (or TimeGate, or whoever else really made the game) towards a project that could actually be saved.If you're thinking of getting it to screw around with friends in multiplayer with, don't. While it can be some fun that way, its a graveyard online and if you want a multiplayer Aliens fix you'd probably just be better off playing Killing Floor with the Aliens mod or some of the previous AvP games which actually have some occassional activity.If you're thinking of giving it to somebody as a joke gift, don't. It'd be cheaper and reap the same results to just mail a picture of you giving somebody the middle finger to the recepient, completely free if you email them.			"

												The Short: If you like the movie (Aliens specifically), you will like (not love) Aliens: Colonial Marines (ACM).  Fairly generic shooter with a great movie tie-in, what can go wrong? Well, lots! A little buggy Ai, spawns and collision geometry can spoil some of the suspense that it does manage to drum up, but enjoyable enough for a few hours, for a few bucks (not retail price though!). Audio is a great help to the overall mood of the game and consistent to fans of the movie. The Long:I paid $10 for the whole meal deal, DLC's and all. Also, I am writing at time when all the extensive patches and fixes have been implemented. If you paid full price without the patches, my sympathies and your wrath probably is justified, that's a guess. With that in mind, the 2014 edition is enjoyable to play like a marine in the Aliens world. Weapons are what terran space marines expect, short the melee weapons. The gun fire is satisfying and shooting mechanic is spot on, would love to have more smart gun though :) Weapons upgrades are more like sidegrades for the most part, and is really more about personal preference and style of tactics of the player. I play more like infantry, so it's pulse rifles, battle rifles and shotguns..wait, that's all there really is in the game! Flamer is a special pick up weapon, as is the smart gun ;_;The Aliens themselves are well crafted and can catch you by surprise if you don't use your radar and terrain carefully. Alien animations are a bit jerky at times when they are transitioning to more complex transitions or moves, especially when they get into your melee region and the game is trying to decide which melee scenario to piece in (up close execution or 1 of the varied push backs) I played this on the hardest setting from the get go and found some parts challenging, but it was pretty easy for the most part.  The boss fights are a real let down, too easy or just brain dead, example: the lifter, punched with the left claw only....Big Alien Al down for the count as I punched it to the corner where it died in frightening death animation glitchies. Honestly, if the Aliens were faster and more deadly with the same numbers, the game would be almost unplayable because the Zeno's would be all over the place and will kill you in an instant even if you got a shot off due to the acid blood and lurking face huggers. Try the Killing Floor Aliens mod and you will understand what I mean, HoE will destroy or put on edge the most well honed of teams in the more confined maps. The environments are well put together and believeable to exist in the Colonial Marine world, some places could use a bit more polish, but it's all well presented for the most part. The level designs are pretty generic with some set pieces for bosses. Don't know what you are looking for if some find this game ugly or inconsistent with Aliens.If you are a fan, I recommend this game at a discount price. There are still some bugs that are unforgiveable given the patches and fixes in place (Aliens spawning infront of me, ok, i shoot it...then another spawns in the same spot...bad!), but they don't brake the overall game and atmosphere. ACM gives us a bit more back story to the events after Alien3 and what will happen in future stories, and that is maybe the best thing that can be said about this game.			"

												Where do I begin. First of all, I really REALLY don't understand all those bad Reviews, but luckily they come mainly from Normal people who obviously know nothing about different techniques to make games. The game is beautiful and couldn't feel more ""Cinematic""It's about Colonial marines not Aliens so giving a bad review because you kill humans? Well Read some about the Colonial marines, there's a few good sources one of which is the old RPG game with the extra book ""Technical manual""Basically , the Colonial marines do not fight Xenomorphs all day long, they actually do fight humans far more often.Also this is put as a Sequel to the 2nd Alien movie, and in my opinion for being a game like this Does it really well. Aliens was never really scary, it was an Intence thrilling Alien Action movie with some terrifying moments at the most.Who can honestly  say this game has not got that feeling of Aliens from 1986?  I think it do, Also the fact that you have to hold the movement detector and not have your gun ready makes it even more Aliens 1986 realistic. I've had great fun playing this game, I'm an Alien fan from childhood when watching the first movie and 2nd around 1986-87. The sounds in this game are incredible Cinematic as well, what do people complain about here? Play the 2nd Alien movie (Aliens) Listen to the chaotic scenes where aliens come from all directions and you'll have exactly the same feeling and sounds. The graphics are great with the Movie grain turned on (looks a lot like watching the film imo)I'm not sure in any way why people have actually given this such bad reviews, for me comparing it with Shooter games like this it's 9 out of 10  The only real thing i could point out as being maybe a tiny bit bad was the Animations from time to time. But I wouldn't give this game 1 out of 10 for that, like a lot of other people seem to do.Buy it, IF you're a REAL Aliens fan (2nd movie with Colonial Marines in it) Then you should love this one, if not well. :) I'm sure if you look deep in your mind you've seen a lot worse and given it much better rating then 3-4 out of 10Buy it, play CO-OP and feel the crazy action around you :) Cuz it's nonstop and it IS crazy cheers!

												Pros: reasonably fun to play. Authentic to the films. You go to pretty much every location from the films that you can think of and would want to go. Some of the drama works. Challenging. Longer than any of the AvP games' Marine campaigns(and almost as long as them all combined. Add Stasis Interrupted and it is longer than them all combined), and does cool some things those don't. Solid MP customization.Cons: meh writing. Fan-fic-y plot. Characters are awkwardly and obviously designed as similar to the film's Marines. One major dumb wish fulfillment retcon. The campaign does slightly overstay its welcome. Still not all that well-made though it's no longer broken. Occasionally does break, especially the AI. MP is dead.My recommendation: if it's on sale... you love the first two Alien films... and badly want to play games in the franchise... consider it.			"

												Can't believe i'm writing a review like this but, I am.I got this game in the ""Alien games"" collection some time ago and have played through it for some hours now, I thought i could get a good laugh at the mess of a game this was, as i had a blast playing through similairly buggy and broken game Ride to hell: Retribution.I was.. ..Quite disappointed though, for better or for worse.Sega has actually gone in and fixed ALOT of the problems that were known with the game, sure. It still have some sub-par looks to it and some things are a bit cringy Like there's a part where you have to walk into a dark area that just screams ""Something is gonna show up here and spook you"" and surprise, it was the alien queen, who then takes you to their lair and then the game continues from there but besides that, I haven't encountered any of the bugs i've seen when people like Criken plays the game. So while the game didn't give me the cringe inducing bugfest i had imagined, it instead offered me a decent Co-op story focused shooter set in the Alien universe.Might be worth giving a try on a sale, if you still don't feel it you can always refund it before your 2 hour playtime. I say it's worth giving a shot though if the premise of the game is anything that interests you.			"

												First of all, they have fixed many of the issues with the game, so the game is definitely playable, so don't worry about that.Biggest fact you need to know, the game is basically designed around a 4 player co-op in regards to the story.  You can play single player, hog all the ammo and med pacs, and you'll get through it as I did, but if you've played any FPS 4 player co-ops you know the dynamic is different to ones designed for single player.Stasis interupted is quite good, definite improvement on the campaign in the main game.  At the end of the day, it's nice to revisit the alien universe, even though it's not a perfect game, atmosphere is great.I would say, if you like FPS and or Aliens... go for it, with the stasis interupted pack... on steam sale only, would not recommend the full price.

												I am a Xeno fan, so I am obviously biased, but at the same time it has to be done right! (lookin at you Alien 3!)I think that this game as it is now (I hear there were issues before) is amazing! The gameplay is immersive, the characters match the era, the tech is almost spot-on (I want the 99-clip pulse-rifle!) and there's countless clear and accurate references to the movies!I have ALL the DLC and strongly recommend it to anyone who can get it all in a bundle or sale.The weapons are satisfying and diverse, the lore is quite accurate (spitters? where the hell did they come from?) and there's so many little side-things you can do to improve your enjoyment.The weapon customisation had me pretty sold and gives you a reason to keep playing.I have not played any multiplayer other than split-screen but will be trying it out soon.

												It took a lot of convincing to even consider this, even with the greatly reduced Summer Sale price, but using TemplarGFX's overhaul mod coupled with the Bug Hunt DLC (much like Zombies from Blops) with mods for welding doors etc. makes it fun and playable. I haven't played it without the mod, but it's decent enough with it. I would only recommend it with a) the mod(s) b) reduced price c) friends to play it with. It's just about worth it with these factored in.			"

												Note: I did not encounter any game-breaking bugs that supposedly exist, nor is this coming from a disappointed Aliens fan.It's about the most mediocre game I've ever played. Nothing is really special. You shoot average aliens and people with an average feeling gun for about 5 hours with an average story averagely.Also you do this in the dark, and if you get snuck up upon (which is a lot) expect to lose all your armour immediately.There is no reason to buy this game, it's just meh. If you have it, it's a mindless shooting of maybe 4 different enemies (the regular aliens, the spitting aliens, the riflemen, and the riflemen with really heavy armour on).			"

												Aliens: Colonial Marines despite the reviews is its not hakf bad. It is an addictive and fun shoot em' up aliens game. With tons of of gamemodes and gametypes ( I advise having a friend get it since no one plays mulitplayer anymore ) and weapons to unlock. Though the game has its downsides such as a terrible campaign. Playing as an alien is hard and not fun it does not catch the Alien genre much at all if you want a true aliens game I would suggest Aliens versus Predator Classic 2000 or Aliens vs Predator. I would recommend this game to people who have friends to play this too who will enjoy a good alien shoot em' up despite the fact it isnt much like alien. 7/10			"

												This game is so bad it gave me 4 different STDs previously unknown to science. Even ignoring the fact that the game failed to live up to any of its hype, or that they pulled a huge bait and switch with the demos and the actual game, the game itself is complete junk.1. The gunplay is clunky at best. It's very slow paced with little variety in the enemies you fight any any given time. The auto save function is also badly implemented and you regularly find yourself forced to go through several dice roll live/die encounters only to get cheap shotted at the last one and having to start the entire series over again. 2. Your deaths feel cheap - Rarely will you have a ""good"" or ""fun"" fight. Either you clean up the Aliens with very little challenge or they will over run you and you die in 1-2 hits. While this melee quick death mechanic is understandable you typically find it happening because the Aliens will glitch and ignore your pushback attack, or because a friendly NPC doesn't pull his own weight - leaving you to ration out your precious bullets while they stand in an empty corner waiting for something interesting to happen. Which brings us to -3. The AI is awful. You a regularly forced to rely on AI controlled partners who forget what their job is. Whether it's opening a door, covering you while you open a door, or sometimes even simply moving out of the way is often well outside of thier ability. The Aliens are equally glitchy. As previously mentioned they will sometimes  ignore your melee attack (often the only thing that will stop a quick death) or leap off of walls and just kind of forget what they were doing. The game is loaded with jump scares where a Xenomorph will leap out of a hatch and then loiter casually while they wait for you to kill them. They have a difficult time going through open doorways and it seems that the only challenge they pose is the occasional cheap death4. The game is ugly - Not a lot to say about this. The textures in this game are unforgivably bad. The Aliens have few animations which makes they look kind of silly when they're doing anything but wall running. It looks like they try to hide some of this behind a very distracting film grain but even that does little to keep the game from looking 10 years older than it really is. 5. The Story is terrible - Just... just terrible. While there are many nostalgic things to see and easter eggs to find you're better off just rewatching the movies because it's not worth the time to slog through the game to find them. The dialogue is ham fisted, even for action movie meatheads and much of the ""Story"" seems like a series of very poorly scripted events that make little to no sense  *Spoilers* Why would a trained Marine throw a grenade at a missile which is sitting near your only way out? Why would multiple umbilicals between the ships break for seemingly no reason? All of this is almost forgivable if the end of the game wasen't completely given away within the first 10 minutes if you have even the most basic knowledge of the Alien seriesTL;DR  No, just no. If this game goes on sale for two dollars, it's still not worth the time to play through it. Instead my suggestion would be to pop ""Aliens"" into your DVD player and just make gun noises at the screen during action sequences.			"

												Definitely not as bad as it's made out to be, thought it's not as good as it was hyped up to be, i played through with the recent patch on ""Ultimate Badass"" difficulty and i really enjoyed the experience. Being someone who grew up with the original AVP 1 and 2 on PC, i feel this adds some new elements to those past expereince and takes some away. Those that i feel were improvements were the ability to pull out your motion tracker instead of it being ""built-in"" to the hud, the graphics (obviously), the AI for sure, audio/atmospheric experience (Music, Gun sounds (Especially the ""true to"" movie M41-A), Alien sounds, and lighting). This game does however, as i said take away from some of the things that made the old AVP Marine campaign good and scary. I think the whole idea of having a team was a cool new expereince, but being forced to look out for yourself in the old AVP made it awesome, and scary. They could have done this by just minimizing the amount of campaign missions that you spend with your squad, and then toned down some of the combat encounters that you would otherwise die in without the help of your squad. I also feel that the old managment of your shoulder lamp battery was good and should have been kept and they could have made it more of a necessity by putting you alone in dark environments. Not only that but the flare system was good as well because it was another resource you had to keep track of. I know this one is more of a ridiculous thing to look at in most games today, but for games like AVP where you have plenty of cool weapons at your disposal, it's a shame you're limited down to 3 in your ""hot-swap"" tray whereas in AVP 1 and 2 you could have them all bound to keys ""1-0"". This is more of a nit-pick feature, but i also was disapointed in the ability to use doors to your advantage against the Aliens, because in AVP 2 there were a few times where you could do that and nothing beats the rush of knowing you have a creature who brings forth death right behind you and then you close the door right in their face (That might just be me though :) ). Overall the game is good and definitely not as bad as it's made out to be, i think most of the bad reviews came from people who never played the old games, or maybe i'm just a softy for the AVP franchise.

												SO! This might be the most controversial game of the last 10 years! No joke! Moving right on! Developed by Gearbox, TimeGate and Nerve, A:CM's story is a true sequel to 1986's Aliens, produced by James Cameron (amazing film) and also Alien 3 (which was kinda sh*tty) and the story meets my expectations and actually exceeds them, although I need to be fair and say that the ending is a bit disappointing AND there was this major plot point that never really got explained in the game (How the hell did the Sulaco get out of Fury 161?). It could use a bit more work, but as a sequel to the movies, it works pretty well and it's quite enjoyable throughout the whole campaign, out of all the 4 Movies + this game...Colonial Marines might have the best story out of all 5, really! (let's face it, Alien(s) never had a good story to begin with... so... it's like a rotten apple in the middle of a pile of dog♥♥♥♥♥♥..)Gameplay: It's great! The sound of the Pulse Rifle just bursting away and the acid spewing from the Xenos is always great and the guns feel amazing! Just like I wanted them too! Some new guns were also introduced, something very risky and hard to pull off, but they nailed it, they feel like they have been there since the original movie! You will fight hordes of Xenos and PMC's throughout the game (the PMC's appear and are explained like in the 2nd level, and while I expected only to be fighting Xenos, the PMC's make sense in the story, surprinsingly!)- Acid doesn't damage you, though... WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥?!As for gameplay, I must also address the Xenomorph gameplay (they are only playable in the Multiplayer modes though). They feel much better compared to the Aliens from AVP2010, which felt very wonky and hard to control.The view is now 3rd person! F-I-N-A-L-L-Y!Every fatality you pull off and every swipe with the claws feel amazingly nice and it's alot of fun! Too bad the Multiplayer is *almost* dead (you can still find some matches occasionally).Graphics: Bad, the graphics are a massive disappointment, they look very different from the 2011 Demo and the Xenos (unlike in the Demo) like disappear after they die, something that didn't happen during the demo gameplay. The game, sadly, also has a few bugs/glitches. I beat the game twice (Soldier (which is normal) and Hardened, doing a 3rd now on Recruit (easy) to collect all the dog tags that are left (Missed like 3) and planning on doing a 4th playthrough on Ultimate Badass mode (it's the f*cked up mode, basically)) and I've witnessed 1 game breaking bug, where a door would just not open! Restarted the game and everything was fixed. Bugs, I found few but some...The most annoying was the Raven Boss battle, which involved the use of a PowerLoader. The Raven Boss battle has the Raven get stuck in some corners (which is the best part, just spam him with attacks xD) and some times teleport to the other corner of the arena. It's by far the worst part of the game, because of how extremely clunky it is!Sound Quality: Amazingly Stellar, the guns sound the same as in the movie Aliens (they used the sound files from the movie so, there's that), the voice acting is solid (for the most part), I found it engaging and the characters sounded decently emotional when they should (too bad the facial animations are sh*t so when they are happy and sad, they look the same, something from like 2006, but this is part of graphics, not the sound, so anyways...), the lip syncing is a hit and miss, sometimes it's great, amazing actually, and sometimes it's just plain bad, so there's that as well...I think I've pretty much covered everything (except what is the controvesy around this game, I'll post it in the comments for those who don't already know it...)To finish it off, Aliens: Colonial Marines is... *shocker* not a bad game! But it's not great either and this game could pull off a GOTY award, it really really could! But to my sadness (as a kind of Hardcore fan of the Aliens franchise), it's far from a GOTy contender.6.5/10, flawed on pretty much every aspect of it, it reeks potential, which btw, sadly isn't met. However! The fact that this game is REALLY FUN is undenyable imo. Thus the score...Flame away, ♥♥♥♥♥es! I enjoyed A:CM even though Pitchford lied his ♥♥♥ off about it. Unexcusable, true; but that doesnt mean it ain't fun. Like a janky space version of Left 4 Dead...kinda.(REVIEW EDITED TO FIX TYPOS)			"

												The only positive thing is Gearbox staying true to the second movie atmosphere, the rest is a total ode to the ridiculous. Marines are grunts (who knew), so obviously stupid and just shoot everywhere, aliens normally are very intelligent and fearsome predators, seem even more stupid, because they just jump in the open straight to you, and oh my hell i can't tell if the dialogs are depressing or funny. And i don't talk about the cheap graphics, i red somewhere a patch correct that, well... must have been even more awful before.Gotta try the multiplayer because that's where the real fun should be, thought i wonder if owners of this game still play this crap. Facepalm + double facepalm combo. I don't recommend it as you can tell, better get Alien Isolation which is far more enjoyable and actually give shivers (or Alien vs Predator if you wanna shoot'em).			"

												This game is great if you you download the mod a guy named Templar made. http://www.moddb.com/mods/templargfxs-acm-overhaul When I originally bought the game it was total♥♥♥♥♥♥ The game is still really hard and if you play on any difficulty beyond the easiest mode ( There are 4-5 difficulty levels) then you will die repeatedly. The checkpoints are far apart and often I had to play through difficult parts over and over. They have series in the game when events are happening such as the following: your supposed to get to the third level of a triple story circular generator room. Clear level 1 and get in elevator (ok that was hard but now im past it), clear level 2 and get to elevator (ok that was harder but I made it finally), clear level 3 and cover marine while he cuts the doo.... aww crap died (wait what? I have to start at level 1 again?) this happens over and over again. in the game and the checkpoints make it hard as you have to basically memorize where each alien will come from in a sequence to make it through, which I enjoyed because of the challenge. on medium or hard difficulty one or two swipes from aliens will kill and they are fast as hell. Havent even tried it on badass, I stuck it on easy and I still get killed every now and then, but hey aliens are supposed to be hard to kill... Definitly get this on sale and dont even try to play it without installing the mod. OR do but notice how much better the mod makes the visuals and the game in general.			"

												Not sure why my hours were reset from the hundreds or so I had to 11. weird.   Suffice it to say, I played this a LOT. So after all the Hype, class action lawsuits, and patches that were larger than the size of the original game... We are left with what is actually (Finally perhaps?) a VERY decent game.   Quite fun in the end.  Too bad it took so long to get there. :(     Pick it up on sale for a GREAT deal. Pros:-lots of game to play through. Plenty of missions for your enjoyment.  Later add-ons even add non-combat sneaking missions-graphics look good.-controls are tight.  Took a couple patches but they rock since late 2014.-Co-op is awesome. full stop.-can be had for $2-3us.  AWESOME deal.  -still some online players for matches and co-op even in 2016! community is small but active.-missions are generally fun. a couple are overkill or difficult on harder settings.Cons:-early weapons are weak. Need to be careful until you have more stopping power.-bugs are tough. takes a little practise to clean house properly. early on especially.-people whine too GD much about the original problem where the game WAS released broken as hell, however it WAS patched, and the is fun.  Too bad it took 6+ months. -bug! bug! bug!			"

												I waited a long time for this title. Yes it could have been better. Was it a let down? I would have to say kinda. However,  I can honestly say that I liked the game, as in I got what I signed up for, murdering xenos by the dozens.  Of course, I bought it much later than when it was first released, so it was a smoother game experience with less bugs. It really should have had Hicks in it longer. In one of those later levels where you had to jump onto that dropship was some very challenging gameplay on the higher difficulty level. It was a let down, but it was still fun. Hell, I may even play it again.			"

												I really do not understand why this game has such a bad reputation. These are the complaints and the facts.Complaints: ""It's too much like COD."" or ""There are too many Weyland Yutani mercs."" and  ""AVP 1999 & AVP 2 were the best aliens games EVA."" My response ""And those game weren't like COD? It's an FPS, what the hell do you expect? I was a fan of both, however they too were typical FPS run and gun games, and AVP 2 Had allot of mercs as well in the marine campaign. ACM has way better graphics than both those games, looks and sounds more cannon and faithful to the movie Aliens, and the voice acting is pretty good and a hell of allot better than AVP 2. But I will admit the dialogue is a little silly at times and unrealistic, and some very dumbass statements were made by a few characters, I'll give the community that one, but is easily ignored and of little consequence.""Complaints: ""It was falsely advertised."" and ""The Game is buggy.""  ""The marines sound too much like COD talk."" or ""The story sucks and has plot holes.""My response ""I saw the steam trailer, and it was not falsely advertized, there was nothing in the official trailer that was not in the game. If people are referring to E3 demos and screenshots literally from 8 years prior to ACM's release. Give me a ♥♥♥♥ing break whiny candy asses. E3 (Which I did not see and could care less about) is not a finished product and in fact is a demo. As for screenshots of earlier development, ya I saw those and they looked alright at the time, but this looks better IMO. And those screens were from another developer who abandoned the project and left us fans hanging, so♥♥♥♥♥♥on those screens and the lazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s for teasing us all those years ago.  As far as being buggy, well I cannot add much to this because I did not purchase this game until the price came down and was already patched. I will not pay $60 dollars for any damn game no matter how much I want to play it. That price point is ridiculous, thus is the reason I haven't bought the last COD's or Deus EX HR yet. Won't do it, other things take priority. But there were a few bugs still, but not enough to break the game experience.  And the complaint that the marines sound like... well... ♥♥♥♥ing marines...?, is idiotic. And as far the story is concerned, Its more cannon than other Alien games, with the exception of Isolation. I could care less about a few plot holes because I have always wanted to explore LV-426, and this alone was a pleasure to experience. And the way they allowed the fan to do this was handled pretty well IMO. And this story was 100 times better then the abominations that are the subsequent movie sequels, Resurrection, AVP, AVP2. As well as the AVP 2 Game, way better story..no one can deny this fact.""Last major complaint of the community is that the story was a little short and the Queen battle sucked. This is a matter of taste, as I thought it was about right, Isolation (Which is a great game) ran just a little long, but that is hardly a blemish. AVP 1999 was no different than this game (Spoiler) as you had to complete a few tasks to blow her out the airlock, and people say it is better than this game. I was a for sure fan of AVP 1999, but most of its praise comes from nostalgia, which is not a bad thing in of itself, but to say it is superior to this game is out right ridiculous. And also I think allot of people read some of the reviews and went in already♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off and on the band wagon. And as for people saying they want a refund are just being melodramatic (Maybe not so much if they paid $60, but that's on them for paying that much for a damn game). In closing I enjoyed this game a little more than AVP 2010 (Marine campaign). And while I love Isolation extremely, it is simply a different style of game that matches the mood of the first movie, while this matches the second movie very well (Remember they were running and gunning in the Aliens as well). I've played through this game three times and I will likely do a forth. My only real complaint is the multiplayer, simply because I can't and never have played it (Servers are empty). I bought this at just a little over $20 but now is at $14 and is well worth it. I give it an overall strong 6.7/10, if that seems high it's because I am a super fan of the franchise, if I was a general gamer and not a strong fan probably a 5/10. If you're a fan of the franchise this is a must for your library. "

Posted: July 26, 2015
												I think this game has been burdened by bad press so I wanted to try and up it's good name. At the time of its original release, the game was incomplete and many felt it had been falsley advertised graphically etc. I also feel sorry for the pre-order people who got somewhat cheated in that respect. That sucks - the lesson there though is, don't pre-order a pc game ever. However, having bought the game about 2 weeks ago for 5 pounds (inc DLC), I have yet to encounter any bugs or glitches -  Gearbox have gone back and done a huge amount of patching, around 10GB worth (much to their credit) - EXCEPT for the very strange one when you try to quit the game and for some reason steam keeps re-launching the game over and over....there are easy fixes for that problem though, so it's really not a big deal. Apart from that, the bugs all seem to be fixed and it runs fine for me.I have really enjoyed this game so far and I expected to turn it off straight away based on what all the other reviews say. But you need to realise that those reviews have everything to do with feeling 'cheated' on initial release and nothing to do with the quality of the actual CURRENT game. The graphics are actually CURRENTLY really nice; not next gen but nearly there - definitely top quality with awesome lighting effects. The strength of this game comes from how they have replicated the atmosphere and feel of the films through use of graphics and animation style - it's really authentic and true to Aliens -  and that is how the graphics succeed. It's not about technicality. If you love Aliens (the second film) this is definitely for you, as you get to go to many of the sick locations from the film and they are accurately portrayed.GOOD THINGS:The gameplay is really fun. If you wanted to be the marine, this is your chance. In honesty it's not perfect, but it's nearly there; Aliens limbs fly off when you shoot; your bullets feel like they connect well; the acid blood is well done; the sound of the guns - infact all the game sounds - are taken directly from the film so its absolutely great and authentic. It feels awesome firing that pulse rifle with its signature noise. Great selection of guns  espcecially with the dlc. The music is the same as the film which makes the atmosphere and experience really strong. The level art, escpecially in Hadleys Hope is excellent. Baddies can be blown to bits - I shot a dudes head off with HIcks' shotgun and loved it - and they die really well at times. Also the game has alot of style to its scripted and non scripted events! Solid voice acting.BAD THINGS:Things that let the game down are really minor and depend on how picky you are. For example some surfaces don't recieve bullet holes, some do. Some glass breaks, some doesn't. Many objects are static when they should have havoc or physX - but some do move and are destructible. Some dead bodies are identical to the next. Aliens corpses disappearing shortly after death. Generally it can feel a little rushed in places - moments when you think 'oh, they coulda done that a bit better...'FINAL WORD:It's a shame because it's only just short of being a perfect Aliens experience and it's as if they ran out of time - demonstrated by the rushed feel of identical dead bodies, surfaces that don't take bullet holes etc. HOWEVER DON'T LET THAT OR THE MINOR THINGS DETER YOU! You get so engrossed in the frantic slaying of xenomorphs that all these minor bad points really do fall into the background: they are over powered by everything good about the game. I urge you to try it but don't pay more than a tenner I would say. NOTE: For best experience, always fire from the hip as the iron sights make the gun look/feel like a toy - once you upgrade to laser sight this becomes easy and the shooting feels great again. This really is a strong game, with a few disappointing things to note, but it is by no means♥♥♥♥♥♥ if it was♥♥♥♥♥♥I would say because I have high standards....SO DEFINITELY PLAY IT! Especially if you are an Aliens fan! But again just don't spend more than a tenner.			"

												Terrible game. Literally the only saving grace is Bug hunt mode which is a seperate DLC where you defend against Waves of Aliens in co-op. It's awesome and i highly recommend you buy the game just for this mode alone. Sadly with the main game within half of one level you're already fighiting waves of humans. What is this i'm playing? Call of Duty Alien Ops? Most of the core game has you fighting humans with some Aliens here and now thrown into the mix. There's literally no respect for the Aliens in this game they are mindless drones with bare bones AI. The tension is ruined by the fact you can carry 15 weapons stocked up with ammo. Seriously? In the movie all they had was a few pulse rifles a busted up Flame Thrower and a couple of Grenades. Here its easy mode though.Don't buy this game for the online because its dead, no one plays this game anymore, which forces it into a singleplayer only game. Now then, unless you have buddies who are willing to pay for this game, Then the mode you should play is Bug Hunt. Things the game does right is the Sound Design. The game Sounds awesome! And that's awesome. Also the Visuals are quite good. The game nails the look of the movies down to the bolts on the walls.Everything else is trash. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, You'd better spend your money on AVP2010 or AVP Gold. More fun and enjoyable and both games are made by a developer who actually care about the francise.

												Aliens: Colonial Marines has gotten a bad rap, and justifiably so. But is it as horrible as people would have you believe? Not really. There are many worse games for sale. But fortunately, there are far more better games out there as well.Much of the uproar about the game was about how its graphics failed to live up to the pre-release trailers; on launch, the game looked noticably poorer in comparison. But even in that sorry state, the game was hardly a disaster on the eyes; in many areas, it looked equivalent in quality to other multi-platform FPS games. In a select few areas, the game was actually quite nice looking, in fact. Since then, the developers have released a four gigabyte patch which rectifies many of the game's visual faults and - while it will never be competitive with games like Metro 2033 or Crysis 3 - can easily hold its own against the Call of Duty or similar games. No, unfortunately, the problems with the game lay far deeper than the visual gloss. Almost every other area of the game was flawed, from the musical score, to the storyline, or the unimpressive AI and underpowered weaponry. Forget how the title looked; the game itself was simply not fun to play.The AI is flat-out laughable. Pre-patch, it was possible to walk up to one of the eponymous monstrosities and punch them to death. Even after being patched, it was not uncommon to see the dreaded xenomorphs of the franchise ignore targets to chase their own tails. They inspired no fear whatsoever. The human enemies were far more of a threat, but only because they could attack from range and thus had a greater opportunity to actually hit you.  The primary change made to the AI by the patch is that their attacks inflicted more damage, but the actual AI routines remain predictible.The story and setting are forgettable at best, and insulting at worst. It flat out contradicts the franchise's canon in a poor attempt at a surprise twist. The characters are uninteresting and the voice-acting was poor, despite the use of known actors such as Michael Biehn, who half-heartedly reprises his role as Cpl. Hicks from the movie Aliens. The soundtrack is utterly unnoticable, and failed to inspire any emotion or excitement whatsoever.I could go on. The animations of the characters - aliens and humans alike - border on the pathetic. The weapons lack the power we expect from guns that carry names such as ""pulse rifles"" or ""smart guns"", and anyway ammunition is in such short supply that you'll rarely get to use them to full effect anyway. The level design is linear and crowded, and - except for the rare setpiece - rarely offers anything appealing to look at. There's not enough variety in weapons or enemies to keep things entertaining, and most objectives are little more complicated than ""walk over there"". There are a few highlights - one level has you stealthing through a sewer of sleeping aliens - but this is the rare exception.Still, the game is not entirely hopeless, especially for fans of the franchise. Revisiting the (virtual) sets of the second movie has great appeal, and it was hard for me not to get excited when I crawled through the ruins of the Hadleys Hope colony, the ductwork of the Sulaco or visited the dead ""Engineer"" seen in both Alien and Prometheus. There were rare moments of terror and adrenaline rush when facing down a horde of xenomorphs. And I never get tired of hearing the scream of an alien or the chattering roar of the pulse rifle.Still, is that enough to save the game, much less recommend it? Sadly, no, on both counts. Aliens Colonial Marines has its moments but they are too far apart and too interspersed with ineffectual gameplay to make for a fun experience. It may not deserve the entirity of the wrath that has descended down upon it, but neither should it garner much praise. "

												This is not bad, but it's not good ethier. When a game takes this long to be made there should have been red flags up by now. Colonial marines is one of those games that people got really hyped for and well got their dreams crushed. The story feels like a bad alien fan fic with characters that are so memorable i forgot who they were after I played the game. hell the story is almost as bad as alien 3.The visuals are mediocre Some ok modelling and it does do the job well of recreating some elements of the movies, I can Admit I did like the designs of the new xenos which are more plausable than say well a winged xeno with fire breath or something. though the particle effects look so bad they even show jaggies and the pixels. sound fairs better, but not much the sound effects again do a faithful job recreating the feel of the movies. As for the gameplay well it's a fairly decent fps. The shooting is competant and shooting xenos CAN be enjoyable just good luck finding that. I do appreciate the retro fps elements like the healthpacks,carrying all the weapons and some exploration by finding certain guns and audio logs. the enemy ai despite what people will tell you *cough* angry joe are not that stupid infact they do what they should do attack the player hell sometimes the enemy was a major threat in some cases in my playthrough. the ally AI it's bad but it isn't a major problem unless you heavily rely on them which you don't. The multiplayer has it's moments but it isn't acceptional. Overall Colonial Marines is just an average fps. Was I dissapointed? yes Could it have been better? yes. I will say that gearbox flat out lying for this product was unforgivable. So yeah I think that people thought colonial marines was awful was because of the high expectations after all anything that goes in dev hell has to be awesome like too human. 5/10 it's not bad nor good just sort of average.

												You know honestly this game was not that bad. Do not get me wrong though it is not a great game by any means. The game does have poor textures in spots, bad AI, very short length, a dead multiplayer, and some unfair balance. Despite this there is some good here. The areas in the game are all very cool to look at despite the graphics not being the best. All of the locations have a very Aliens feel to them with pretty good attention to detail. The weapons all feel pretty cool to shoot and they were all fun to use. The sound effects and sound in general in this game is fantastic and pretty immersive. The story was not super terrible (nor was it good though honestly thought it was better then that resurection movie) There is no two weapon limit(You get an inventory that you can swap weapons whenever). If you are playing on the hardest difficulty(the only way to play this game) then the game can be pretty tense.If you like the liscense and you like fps then I suggest trying it on sale. I was able to get this game and all the dlc for like 80 cents on a discount Aliens bundle. I would say this game is worth about 5 dollars to play through. It is an average fps with a decent use of the liscense that will make this worth playing for a fan.			"

												First of all ,the graphics fidelity is marvellous such as the usage of the diverse range of artistic assets used within the various beautifully constructed levels such as the Marines Spaceship in the first level which accuratley recreates the asthetics of the film.The gameplay is absolutely ""Smashing"" , the gunplay feels akin to a triple A shooter game more than you would ever expect,If your a hardcore Call Of Duty Fan then this game should definelty float your boat.Then it comes down to the Sound, This is the money maker of the game, from its heavy bass grenade explosions to the subtle Team callouts from the likes of O'Neal this is a true mesmerising experience.Last but not least we cannot forget the Infamous Homage paid to the Pulse Rifle, This gun is an exact recreation of the film not just in asthetics but in sound, As you begin to further use the Pulse Rifle it feels like your actually in the game and not just using a Oculus Rift.Overall Score 10/10lol jk this game is an awful piece of Shxt with no redeeming qualities			"

												When this game was first released it was a buggy unplayable mess. TemplarGFX's ACM Overhaul fixed most of the game's major issues, so it's now far less buggy and far more fun. So my ""thumbs up"" vote assumes you immediately download and apply that mod (look on the forums for more info).The game is most fun in co-op. I got three friends together and we went through the main campaign and the DLC campaign, ""Stasis Interrupted"" and it was quite fun. Do note that the DLCs are no longer sold separately so if you buy the game you get everything, though I would definitely wait until it goes on sale which seems to happen fairly often.It's a first person shooter that verges on the ""survival horror"" genre as your enemies are very dangerous and you'll always be looking for scarce health and ammo. There's a variety of different enemies to fight in different tactical situations. Sometimes there are intense run-and-gun sections where your only goal is to survive while running from one area to another. Other times you'll be given ""defend this area"" missions and be able to set up auto-turrets to make your last stand. There are even a few brief stealth missions.The main enemies are of course the titular Aliens. They are extremely dangerous and can kill you almost instantly at close range even if you're at full health. They can also outrun you, spit acid, spill their acidic blood on you if they die too close, run on the walls and ceilings, come out of floor vents, and generally scare the hell out of you. You'll have access to a large number of weapons, some of which you'll recognize from the movies. The weapons have secondary fire modes and can be upgraded over time which keeps things interesting. You'll also have a motion tracker which can be very helpful as the aliens will constantly be trying to ambush you from every direction; however you can't have your gun and motion tracker out at the same time.The storyline is a continuation of the first two Aliens films. You'll revisit some recognizable areas from the films and even meet some characters from the films. The storyline is one of the strongest aspects of the game, the voice acting was generally good, and the music meshed well with what was going on. Graphics were good (WITH the Overhaul mod!). The scary atmosphere was superb; they really did a great job with setting the scene.Singleplayer is actually significantly harder than co-op because there is no one to revive you if you go down. You will be accompanied by AI teammates for most of the game, but their usefulness varies widely. Sometimes your AI teammates are able to dish out a lot of damage making a hard fight easy. Other times your teammates will sit around and watch unconcerned as you get swarmed and torn to shreds by aliens at close range. MULTIPLAYERIt's hard to find a good game. The ""Bug Hunt"" survival DLC was to me the most fun out of the multiplayer modes. You have to survive successive waves of enemies, and use downtime between waves to open up new areas and set up better defenses. BUGS:TemplarGFX's Overhaul fixes most of the bugs, but these three you'll probably run into...1. We did have some crashes in co-op only, most of which seemed to revolve around the flamethrower weapon, so we just stopped using flamethrowers and this problem went away.  2. The game automatically restarts when you try to quit. Run the game as an administrator or quickly click the X icon to close out the game restart.3. Quicktime events. Sometimes an alien will leap on you and a quick time event will start in which you have to press E or V to push them off and survive. The V event works, but the E event never does, making facehuggers actually one of the most dangerous enemies in the game. They are thankfully rare however.Overall I had a love/hate relationship with this game. It has brief moments of brilliance marred by moments of buggy stupidity that will make you lament at how great this game COULD have been. As it is now I can only say it's ""good"" not great, and can only recommend it to Aliens fans and those looking for an inexpensive survival horror shooter.			"

												I can appreciate game difficulty, but just getting swarmed is stupid and a waste of time.Some of the animations look horrible.  A marine puts up his gun, pulls a grenade, throws it and then pulls his gun back out.  The whole animation just looked like a jerky mess.Everytime I close the game, it relaunches itself.  The only way for me to kill the game is with task manager.  Unacceptable.The good things about the game are the atmosphere and sound effects.  They got that right, but its just not enough to keep me playing.  Such a disgrace to the Aliens franchise.			"

												I've enjoyed playing ACM. The game has much potential, but was messed over by a combination of the original Developer's poor implementaiton cycle of the game along with being plagued with negative press on the Internet. I have all the DLC for ACM. It's fun playing the single player story line, and playing multi-player with my friends. I especially like Bug Hunt. The game is well worth the $35 I spent on it. "

												Okay, so if some of you pay attention to my reviews, you might notice that I reference this game a lot, but in more of a negative context. After writing my Alien: Isolation review and looking at how much I trashed this, I decided to speak the truth about Aliens: Colonial Marines.First things first - Colonial Marines isn't a horrible game, but it isn't quite great either.What it does do right is be a game about the United States Colonial Marines, as well as being a followup of Aliens. The story makes some, but not much sense, and the characters are like weak polyps compared to the cast of Aliens. Perhaps my favorite thing to make fun of is the recurring theme/phrase of ""We don't leave Marines behind!"", which I guess is supposed to sound heroic, badass and macho, but it sets up the pins for the ending to knock down. (The ending is actually really funny because of this, but I'm not going to spoil it.)The gameplay could most certainly use some third-party modifications from sites such as moddb.com, or any other sites that might have good mods for this game (in fact, message me and tell me if you find some good ones). The gameplay is beyond too easy, and as Angry Joe describes, if it weren't for scripted moments and moments where you have to kill all of the enemies to progress, then you ""could completely run through entire levels in less than five minutes; ignoring Aliens along the way, never firing a shot, and still win."" My recommended perscription is the ""Survival"" mod on the aforementioned website, since it makes the hardest difficulty a true challenge that made me die more times than Alien: Isolation did. The Aliens can potentially perform finishing moves on you at full health, and acid is absolutely fatal. (It also gives you a classic pulse rifle with the original appearance and a proper 95-round capacity.)Multiplayer is also pretty cool, since unlike Aliens vs. Predator, you can unlock mutations, perks, traits and stuff for both Marines and Aliens, who both level independantly of one another. And like in AVP, you are able to personalize both species; for Aliens you can do things like change the design of your head, the color of your carapace, and your fatality (do you want to puke acid all over his face, or his heart?), and for Marines it's pretty much like Make-A-Marine Workshop, ""Where Badasses are Made"" - different heads, voices, camouflage patterns, pouches, knives, helmet attachments, decals for your helmet, shoulders and chest, and much, much more that really can't be described perfectly.So if you want to leisurely shoot through sci-fi's most infamous serpent with acidic blood and spring-loaded jaws, or have a Call of Duty experience for a cheaper price, then this is a pretty good game to play; though if you want a great Aliens experience closer to the films, play all of the AVP games as well as Alien: Isolation.

If somebody really love/like the alien films than this is the best game what i can recommend for you. Because the game is very spectacular, we can visit the LV-426, our team mate is Bishop the android from the Aliens. We can collect some epic weapons from the movie team. For example: Hick's shotgun or Ripley flamethrower. So the point is, If u are the huge Alien fan than don't thinking about the bugs, errors. Just enjoy the epic bug hunt! Have a good game for everyone, and good luck for the multiplayer!			"

												Honestly, it's a fun game and has a lot for those of us who are fans of the Alien franchise. All the easter eggs were great, and you actually had to look for them. They even included all the iconic weapons such as 'Hick's shotgun' & 'Ripley's pulse rifle'. I'm not sure what the game was like when it was first released but as of right now I'd say it is worth paying for. Really a great game and has tremendous replay value. I'm really not sure what all the stink was about with this game but again, I did not play this when it first came out.I have yet to play the multiplayer but I look forward to it. Aliens vs Marines has been brought back and who doesn't love that? (For those that remember AvP games of the past)Beware the sewer! Enjoy the game.			"

												So... A:CM isn't all we were led to believe it would be... I can understand many of the bad reviews because of that. That said, the game isn't really all that bad. It has great music and sound design, many of the sounds coming straight from the movies. Also the vehicles and spacecraft are true to the core of the Aliens franchise. There are numerous AI and clipping issues that, at times, are game breaking. There are also areas that, strangely, are easier on the higher difficulties than the lower ones... Strange as that sounds.Presently wishing there was an option for ""Maybe"". Definitely only get this if it is on sale with a hefty discount. It can be quite fun, but it can also be quite frustrating. If you are a fan of the movies, you will probably like it a good deal if you can get past the glitches.			"

												Blah, Blah, life-long Alien fan, heart broken, dreams shattered, never before has the Aliens franchise let me down, etc. I played through the single player campaign with gritted teeth and had a pretty disappointing time. I paid maybe 7 bucks for it and knew what I was getting into. It's not that it's just bad. It's boring and mediocre. The reason I am giving a thumbs up however is the multi-player co-op which I had an absolute blast with. Playing through the game with a buddy is well worth the 5 or so bucks you should only ever pay for this game. It's like watching a crappy B-movie with your friends and what was annoying before is now a joke shared.  "

												The horror of being a Colonial Marine is real thanks to SEGA, above the criticism, Aliens Colonial Marines delivers a(n) (almost) solid experience. If you really want to find cons in this game then you'll likely find them and if you're a fps gamer then you'll probably find this game not-so-advanced in terms of gameplay, but the lover of the genre, the old school fps-type player and in a closer way the hardcore lover of the Alien franchise, cannot ultimately find this game uninteresting and will eventually give it a playthrough sooner or later. That's because Aliens Colonial Marines is a game that keeps intact the core atmosphere of Aliens, and given that you're able to close an eye at the occasional glitch and that you're not demanding too much in terms of intricate or extremely godmode fps mechanics, then you'll like this game. Afterall, you're the average Marine on your (not so) daily routine-job, trained to kill, that's true, but still partially green against a menance that's not human in form and mind. You will embark a semi-space oddissey revealing your true nature as a survivor, demonstrating that you're not that average afterall, but an extremely capable soldier if not a hero, should we consider the ethics. All in all, the story is good for a spin-off, if not for some forced innests and twists inside the canon that maybe were a bit hazardous. This game is deadly both in the reconstruction of all the stuff that we've seen in the movie, and in the idealization of new ideas and concepts about the setting. Elements and details such as weaponry and sounds are 100% loyal to Cameron's creature, and the same goes for the whole visuals, paying their tribute to H.R Giger and other artists.Pros:- Stays true to the movie- Old school adrenaline formula- Good atmosphere, tasteful setting, concrete believable sci-fi lookCons:- Sometimes it's glitchy- Not so appealing to non Alien(s) fans Personal comment:This game managed to realize one of my childhood dreams: to be a Colonial Marine (trapped) on LW-426 fighting hordes of aliens.

												Это крайне заурядный шутер: старомодный, некрасивый, неудобный и очень тоскливый. Нет интересных событий, нет зрелищ, нет постановки, нет умных тактических сражений, нет страха, нет атмосферы. Игра выглядит несовременно и неряшливо сделана, несмотря на детальную проработку. Физики оружия нет. Здесь можно увидеть, как вода подтекает из целой и невредимой трубы, ксеноморфы выползают из вентиляционных отверстий, за которыми зияет чернота, а персонажи иногда отказываются делать то, что велит им скрипт. Чужие не просто ведут себя глупо, они еще и нелогичны. Они выскакивают на свет, затем прыгают на стену, выползают на видное место и застревают там. Из врагов натурально падают ящички с гранатами, патроны и аптечки, по палубам «Сулако» разбросаны шлемы и бронежилеты. В кампанию можно играть даже вчетвером, но сюжет для этого совсем не предназначен. В результате получается глупость: там, где по сюжету в одиночной игре должны были быть двое морпехов, оказываются сразу пятеро. В игре четыре сетевых режима, из которых выделяется только «Спасение». Задача морпехов — пробежать из пункта А в пункт Б и выжить, задача чужих — помешать им и всех убить. Управлять чужими придется с видом от третьего лица, а анимация тут просто ужасна — нормально проползти через дверной проем уже составляет проблему, какие уж там скрытные атаки и молниеносные нападения. Карт для каждого режима только две. Моя оценка 6/10. "

												Aliens Colonial Marines. Having gone through the campaign, and experienced the multiplayer for a few hours, I feel like I can give my review/opinion of this title. Let's get one thing out of the way first. Everyone knows the amount of hate this game is having everywhere. Reviewers didn't like it, and players didn't like it either... Although i feel most of those players talking about how bad this game is, probably didn't even try it. The question everyone asks is this: Is A:CM really that bad? The answer my friends, is yes and no. This is a very straight forward, linear shooter. Objectives are simple, aliens are dumb (terrible AI in the sense that they always run at you, with no strategy other than eat your bullets), humans are annoying to deal with and you are incredibly overpowered with all the weapons you can carry with you at all times. The only way this game will challenge you a bit is on the Ultimate Badass difficulty. A lot has been said about the visuals, but having played this game maxed out my opinion is that the game looks good, if not great. There is the occasional low rez texture, but the PC version at least manages to look above average. The unreal engine is a well proven juggernaut in the games industry, so the engine is not the problem. The lazyness of the developers is, but only in some aspects of the game world. It could have looked a lot better (no out of the box Direct X 10 or 11 support... Gearbox what's wrong with you...), but as it stands this game looks ok, and in some parts it looks great.I feel the gameplay is a lot like COD. Depending on who you ask, it may be a bad or a good thing. In my opinion the gameplay is fine, the game is fast and the shooting mechanics are simple to master. Most fans of shooters like Crysis, Far Cry or Battlefield will more than likely hate the gameplay of Colonial Marines.It is a very simple game for today standards.Having said that, if you are an Alien fan, you will most definately enjoy this game, and possibly even love it. The details and fan service from the alien franchise are top notch. There are tons of references and visual cues from that beloved franchise. But the game itself falls flat in it's ambitions, and it is certainly not the Aliens sequel we were promised. The story is wonky and doesn't make much sense, but it's ultimately serviceable. Multiplayer is fun, providing you play with players from your own rank. It can be incredibly unbalanced due to the level up system, but stick with it and you will have some fun. In conclusion, i would only recommend this game as a must buy if you are a truly hardcore Aliens fan. The game is flawed, it lacks the tension from the Aliens franchise, and it won't scare you much, if at all. Some moments in the game do make you feel you are in the movie, but these are few and far between. If you are undecided about this game, or if you are a shooter fan, chances are this game will be too linear for your taste, and it is not much of a challenge. If you can try the game somewhere before buying would be best. I know most people are hating on this game, but I am having a great time playing it. It is a very decent shooter, but we were all expecting a great one... And great Colonial Marines is not. I would rate this game a 6.5 out of 10The Good-Environments true to the movies;-Plenty of fan service;-Some (few) aspects of the story-Co-Op;The Bad-Wonky AI at times-Unbalanced Multiplayer-Low quality textures in unexpected places;-Linear			"

												For the love of god dont buy this game. AI is so bad, both friendlies and hostiles. You really have no idea whats going to happen. Friendly AI is always in the way or stuck somewhere so you have to run back or restart the lvl. Guns feel weird, bad sound and just doesnt feel like a gun. Its like there is no feed back from it, just a pixel thing infront of you that fires bullets.There is no feeling in the game itself, after a misson a score board comes up and ""LVL UP, UPGRADE, BUY THINGS TO YOUR GUN"". In the middle of this horror war between the marines and the aliens, it just doesnt feel right. I did not play the multiplayer so yea, find it for 2£ and play for yourself, I am not going to!Update: After I refunded this game I bought it again for 3 dollars a year later. I heard a bunch of fixes was added. I can report that the game still looks crap (GTX970, i7 4790 quad core, 16 gig ram, 250gig SSD). Framerate drops occur every time you move into a new area, I can ussualy play in steady 60fps but drops very often to 30 and below. The enemys is still very weird, sometimes charges straight at you but for the most part they run around and dont do much. The friendly AI is a little bit better, still not good though. Very un-atmospheric.I dont really feel like I am a part of the world, just running around, leveling up and getting ""LEVEL COMPLETED WOAAH"" after ever misson. Just doesnt feel like an Alien game.

												as we all know the game was advertised pre release as aving far better graphics than it came out with, id always wondered what what was up with that until i finally got this game today and saw it was on an old DX9 engine, no doubt a compromise we can thank the xbox360 and ps3 for -_- but if you can look past the lack of features that make todays game look so good you can see the textures, lighting and models are all as promised and show a real labour of love the game doesnt look all and out bad just lacks features people with lower grade PCs would turn off anyway. freindly AI howether is exactlty as bad as promised and expect little help from your NPC allies but of course the game IS meant for co-op. that being said the aliens behave exactly as they should and i say that as childhood alien obsessor. take it from someone who collected every comic, trading card, book and novel on the franchise! expect them to use hit and rrun tactics when alone where they will attempt to hide in the shadows and use the cealing and enviroment to close in on you or lie in wait for you and to be rushed by dozens at a time. as for the enviroment and sets everything is down to a T i found no fault at all! to some up the devs clearly did an incredible job building this game its just a shame they had to ship it out on such an outdated engine.

												5 out of 5 for all the right reasons.I have never reviewed a game before, but I'm going out of my way for this one because it deserves to be defended.The game is not mind blowingly spectacular. It's not a high end, maximum graphic type game.HOWEVER, what the game does have is gameplay that keeps you highly entertained and that's what I paid for.The COOP is perfect, arming 4 Marines in a war against Aliens and mercenaries. The weapons upgrade system is minimal but leaves you feeling satisfied when add new attachments and skins to your guns.The A.I. isnt terrible and on the Ultimate Badass it's quite fun with 4 people waging war against the Aliens.I do not have the DLC's however I am told they only make the game better than it already it is.Long story short, people give this game a bad rap because they are expecting a major title type game. That just isnt the case here, but rest assured, it's a fantastic game and I'd pay for it again if I had a do-over. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a highly addictive and action packed COOP game.Posted: December 28, 2013.			"

												I think this game is underrated; there are some bugs and anooying things, which if you've read any other reviews, you will know about. They aren't game-breaking. If you accept that it's not going to be spectacular and are a fan of Alien/Aliens movies, you can suspend your disbelief and it's good fun to kill aliens with the guns you've seen in the movies. Get it when it's on sale (I'd recommend the $5 price point).If you have limited time for games, there are definitely better ones out there, but getting to use a pulse rifle is quite fun.			"

												I bought it so what? I love this franchise and don't judge! Even if most everyone else thinks this game is a piece of crap. I was among the many that stayed away because of the reviews and how much people felt cheated and lied to. After the patch, it became something different which is why I even considered forking over the $5 for this game. I will also admit that this isn't the same thing that was shown at E3, maybe a financial thing came up and they had to reduce things to be able to finish the product. Also, keep in mind that it wasn't just Gearbox that worked on this game, there were a few other studios who had their hands in as well funds more than likely had to be distributed evenly among the developers.I'm 27 years old and I was exposed to this franchise at a young age I remember being on the edge of my seat chewing on my nails because the movies were so intense.Now for the review. At first glance this game doesn't seem like much and most people need to be hooked in the first five minutes otherwise it's a flop or you have those that have played it for hours and hours and still feel cheated. In my case, that's not the truth here even though it kind of had a slow take off I will admit that I did get spooked a little bit even though the graphics are not top notch, but I don't care as long as the game has some sort of mechanic to make up for it. This game combines just enough intense moments, gun action, and Aliens that aren't as dumb as most people think to make up for the mediocre visuals, the new AvP wasn't that pretty either, but again visuals are not my primary focus when it comes to a franchise that I love. I personally think that they nailed the atmoshphere of the 1986 movie, the Aliens look great maybe just a little bit muddy up close, they feel real and can catch you quick if you aren't paying attention. There are moments where their AI literally stops making them a part of a shooting gallery with stationary targets. But when the AI does work, watch out! You'll be surprised.Now for the sound and music, just one word, WONDERFUL! Weapons, environmental ambience, screeches all sound legit, etc. Get a good sound system to really enjoy them.Would I recommend this game to a friend? Well, simple answer if they can see through the crap people claim about this game, sure. Otherwise it's not for everyone. It's always going to be a love to hate relationship with any game plain and simple.8 out of 10 for me, I'm pretty satisfied with it despite it's minor flaws. The truth is people, your beloved CoD, BF3/4, Halo, and anything else game related are not going to be 100% perfect and they won't always be what you want them to be. So, just play it and see for yourself.			"

												This is my first review on steam, First off, I've seen the entire playthrough (w/o DLC) for this game and i hardly give myself any reason to hate it, Yes! GB screw up this one, I believe there's plenty negative reviews to go around. I thought thebase game was bad, nooo.. boy, was i surprised when i start the game byplaying ---DLC: Stasis Interrupted. I start off thinking i was in heaven, The glare in the lift was so strong squint my eyes just to find my way around. With this issue goes on majority part of the game any hint or text in the screen is practically gone. From graphic and now the AI problem, After meeting up with HICKS, his gone 70% of the time even though player and hicks is in a tagteam battle.Magically he'll appear at the checkpoint or any places that requires him to do a bypass or to meddle with the computer, basically you're a one man show most of the time. And you thing britney's lip sync was bad, wait till you check out the dialog betweenweyland and hicks... Oh my, You'll be surprise.Secondly, WHY ON EARTH IS OUR MAIN CHARACTER (PLAYER) WONDERING AROUND BY HIMSELF?when i see Colonial Marines, I figured it'll be abit more crowded then what i saw, a handful of marines ain't cutting it for me. I only saw marine battles nearing the end of the game as theywere GTFO of the planet, WTF? were there marines waiting for a cue or something?""I've got no use for a dead marine, Son!""But I wouldn't thumb down this game for a terrible DLC or the fact that I'vejust start out in my first few mission, I hope they wouldn't ♥♥♥♥

												Aliens Colonial Marines ReviewI have to admit Aliens: Colonial Marines on the PC is actually not bad graphically, saying that I am writing this review after a few years since it came out with all the patches and update's.I have to say after playing the console version the PC version of Aliens:Colonial Marines is without a doubt the best version of the game what the game should of been like on release, I picked this game up for cheap in 75% discount sale, so I never felt like I was being cheated out something it was bargain buy.Biggest problem over all with the game is that the story is not logical and sometimes seems a little dumb at parts you got impression there was no passion behind the story they were developing game guess that what happens when out sourced and passed  along to as many dev-teams like they did. The game is fun to play: Campaign & CO-OP mode is excellent  which is the games strongest point where can jump in with a squad of friend and go on exenomorph killing spree.I would say campaign is probably the game biggest weakness but online Multi-player is fantastic and amazing fun it really does shake up FPS when you have to think about ambushing marines and using stealth and use your wit's to get a kill instead of running and gunning like you would in a (Call of duty match).Multiplayer - I highly recommend (Escape Mode) and playing as the (Lurker Alien) and also the (Spitter for Team Death Match) which has the ability to shoot acid blood into colonial marines face. I found myself going back  to online Team Death match - who ever made online mode well done because it's great fun shame the game was handled as poorly as it was becuase level designs has allot love put into them really does feel like you are on the world of LV-426.

												At this point, everyone knows the lowdown on Aliens Colonial Marines. This is not a good game. It's a terrible game with a production so troubled it's legendary. It's a game built on lies and shady behavior. Yet I admit I don't despise this game as much as it's reputation impiles. I won't lie, I consider this game a bit of a guilty pleasure to be honest. I guess I'm such a fanboy of the Alien films that I can find a teensy bit of enjoyment. It does look and sound like an Aliens game. The sound design in general is one of the game's few good points. It does feel like an Aliens game to me, albeit an awful one. However, while I may find some stupid enjoyment from this game, by no means can I reccomend it. Honestly it probably is one of the worst games of the 2010's. Gameplay is by the numbers at best. The Xenos are barely in it. The main campaign is pitifully short. The AI is still very dumb, though better than on launch. Graphics as is are passable but nothing great. The story is ATROCTIOUS. Perhaps it's because I got this game with all the DLC post launch, patched and for like 5 bucks. I may find some joy here in a ""So Bad It's Good"" way but that is no reccomendation. Even with the admirable and impressive mod by Templar GFX the game is still not something I would reccommend. Just get Alien Isolation or AVP 2010. Or even the classic AVP 2000.			"

												Having bought this on pre order for PS3 and being utterly utterly disappointed/angry with it, im not entirely sure why I ended up buying it again for PC... oh hang on I know, it wasnt £40 anymore, it was £3. If you make the effort to read the community pages and mod this up (have a look in the .ini files, you'll find all kinds of gfx options that are locked out originally) you will probably find a bit of enjoyment here, particularly if you are an Aliens fanboi/fangrrrl. Multiplayer seems to still work decently as of Feb 2014 which is something I certainly couldnt say for the abysmal PS3 version. The last patch on PC also seems to have fixed a lot of the ludicrous AI issues that plagued it when it first came out, and if you apply all the mods correctly its not an awful looking game at all with Bloom / HDR etc enabled. It just makes you think ""what if they had actually got their act together in the first place?"" A missed opportunity for sure but worth a punt in the sub-£5 category and if you can be bothered to download a couple of the small mods and do some .ini file tinkering.			"

												Going against the grain on this game. and giving it a recommendation. (In fact, I actually own it on  console just for the CE. Picked up the PC version for $1.99, because quite simply, I'm much better at FPS on a PC than console... The CE had to be mine, as I grew up a HUGE Aliens fan, as a kid of the 70s and 80s, and had to add it to my Aliens ""display o' goodies"")The game itself is far from great, but it's certainly not horrible, either. I didn't get to playing it before the giant patch they released, but what I have played is certainly passable. Graphics are decent, but I'm not a huge ""graphics guy,"" as long as the gameplay is at least solid. And ACM is a game that delivers some decent gameplay. Much like Duke Nukem Forever, the game's greatest fault lies in all the hype and desire over years of public want. (Of course, Gearbox's famous ""gameplay video"" shown certainly created some ill will.) There's nothing here that does the game greatness, nor have I found anything that makes it truly falter, either. Sure, it feels and looks a little dated, but does that break it as a game? No. Are there some really fun moments? Yes. Is most of it just standard FPS fare that you can find in most budget titles? Yes.The use of the Aliens license is a double edged sword. As an Aliens NUT, there's some real fun when boarding the Sulaco and stumbling across Bishop's lower half, seeing the grating pulled up from where the Queen stalked a crawling Newt. It's fun walking through Hadley's Hope, entering Operations and seeing the aftermath of the Colonial Marine's last stand, from blown through ceiling tiles the Aliens swarmed through, to the floor where Hudson was pulled down to his demise. It's fun finding the sentry guns. Fun finding Newt's doll's head or the final resting place of PFC Hudson. You can tell there WAS, in fact, a lot of love for the Aliens saga thrown into this game.But, it also hurts it... Don't ask too many questions of how most of Hadley's Hope is still intact when a major plot device of the movie was how quickly they needed to leave before being vaporized. There are plot holes here you can drive a truck through, and Gearbox does the one thing I cannot stand... Introduce ""new"" types of Aliens w/ nary an explanation. (Maybe I'm being too critical, and I believe I'm just a touch over half way through the story... Perhaps there's some sort of explanation given at some point...) But if you're going to get the license and rally around how much you respect the fiction involved, please don't allow the inner fanboy to start throwing things in there just to throw things in there. (While the Xenos typically gather some traits from their hosts.... Alien 3s 4 legged variety being an example,) what the heck led to walking time bomb Aliens? If the game is going to be considered ""canon,"" (as has been stated in interviews before the game's release,) PLEASE show it some respect and stick to the ""rules."" (Ummm... so only the Marines on the Sulaco carried pulse rifles with ""extended"" magazines? Even extended, in the game, it doesn't carry the 99 rounds featured in the movie. Feels like a forced way to add more tension when you need to constantly reload.) I would also make the suggestion to use this game with SweetFX and locate in their community a fanamde preset entitled ""Aliens Colonial Marines Almost Demo."" It makes the game look, IMHO, pretty great via presets, and adds a bluish hue consistant with the James Cameron film. If you're an Alien nut, you'll probably enjoy the game and many of its tributes to the classic while also driving you a little crazy as to some of the plot holes. I've found it to be good in nearly every category, but never crossing over into great. Everything is just... So standard.If you're just looking for a FPS, I couldn't recommend unless it's on a deep discount. The $1.99 I paid for it to play on a system I'm more comfortable with was a steal, as far as I'm concerned, even owning it already. Sadly, you can probably find other FPSs cheaper that offer the same experience... A mostly average shooter.In a score term, I'd have to give it a 65%... For an Aliens nut, that number may crawl into the low 70s, maybe 75. Regards,Doc8998			"

												Short Answer:  Recommended to buy for single player campaign.  Has Michael Bien and Lance Hendrickson  voice talents offer a better alternative to what happens after aliens.  Graphics are decent, and the game difficulties are very challenging.Multiplayer public servers are dead.  You can probably play with your friends via steam, but there is nothing public left.			"

												The game isn't actually too terrible. Just a few things here and there that make it a little unbearable.Story:The story isnt bad, a little vague at times and confusing if you haven't watch the movies, so I would recommend watching the movies if you havent seen it before you play. Only if you care about the story. If not, just go right on through and skip all the scenes.Graphics:They aren't bad for the year and even for now. Some of the textures though look like they came out of an old ps2 game as they are extremely pixelized.Sound:I really can't complain about the sound, sometimes it glitched I would be hearing things double.Gameplay:The gamplay is overall solid as long as you are playing as the marine. As a xenomorph it is completely skewed as I didnt why it was going certain ways as I was climbing.Achievements:This game to complete the achievements 100% you need 3+ people to complete it because of the challenges. There is also grinding for levels and kills.In the end I did enjoy the game playing with a friend, it had some solid moments where we laugh and had fun. Playing by yourself wasnt a complete joy but it was a small challenge when playing on the hardest difficulty.			"

												There are a lot of negative reviews for this game and I can see why. But as a die hard fan of the series, with friends who play it, I think it's a lot of fun. I've seen some reviews where the game crashes or gets stuck in a weird loop of closing and restarting itself but it hasn't so much as stuttered for me. It's Aliens: Colonial Marines, not Aliens: The Definitive RPG. You're a meathead soldier on a meathead quest. It was always going to be just a shooter. If you really love the franchise, it's worth the 15 bucks. Or wait for a sale. I find it a lot of fun.			"

It looks like a PS2 game threw up on doom 2. I have played it to death and got every achievement so i can tell you for a fact that I have spent enough time to see all it has to offer.Graphically... nah, it looks awful.Gameplay... nah, aliens struggle to attack anyone but player and marines couldnt care less.Sound... oh god no. overlapping audio clips and constant pulse rifle drone. and i love the pulse rifle noise.so this is why ill recommend it... TemplarGFX. looks great, reworks everything. it is fantastic. makes the game worth it all. its tragic that a mod is what it takes to make this game good. it should be better from the start.			"

												Remember at the end of Shawshank Redemption when Andy makes his escape through the sewer pipe? How he crawls to freedom through 500 yards of♥♥♥♥♥♥smelling foulness and once he finally exits the pipe, he throws his arms up in the air and soaks in the rainfall? That scene pretty much sums up the Aliens: Colonial Marines experience. You spend about six hours trudging through a dull and repetitive FPS that's loaded with awful AI, unsatisfying gunplay, and poor writing. A truly tedious ride that lacks any real tension. But then you beat the final boss and reach the end credits. Happiness begins to pour over you. You realize that it's all finally over and celebrate by quickly deleting the game from your hard drive entirely. You feel like you crawled through a river of♥♥♥♥♥♥and came out clean on the other side.I'm just thankful that I was able to get A:CM for free after rebate, putting me out only the cost of a stamp. Now if only there was a way to get that six hours of my life back.			"

												Don't believe the haters. Maybe it is more like an old-school shooter than the modern FPS we all know and love (loathe?), but who ever said that was a bad thing? I couldn't count the number of hours I've sunk into the Dooms and Quakes over the years (and their innumerable mods - yes, including Aliens Doom) and I'm having just as much fun now as I did then.  I didn't have any expectations of this game; never saw a demo, a preview, a screenshot, or an artist's impression of one of the developers having lunch between coding sessions.  I heard the bad press, but chose to ignore it and make my own mind up, and I don't regret the purchase for a minute.  I didn't get it until after the first big patch was released, so I can't vouch for what that brought, and it does sound like it addressed some of the initial criticisms.  So to be fair to those that were disappointed, I don't know what they saw on release day.  Maybe the criticisms were justified and maybe I wouldn't have felt the same way about the game as I do now if I'd bought it then. But I didn't, and with Steam's auto-patching, if you buy it now, you'll never see the Day 1 version either.  You'll only see what is by all accounts, an improved experience.  Do yourself a favour and check it out for yourself.  Make up your own mind instead of being a sheep and bagging the game without ever owning or playing it.  You won't regret it.			"

												This game is not worth the price tag it has, correct price is below 5 $/€.On release, it was unfinished, but recent updates have brought it to ""playable"" condition, not ""Must buy"" condition.Campaing story is complete mess, not even the co-op mode in it is gonna fix that, as the story was designed for 1 character and ally NPCs, while the co-op just adds more characters that have no part in the story.Not even DLCs are priced correctly, most of them should be free, like Bug Hunt DLC, which is overpriced, as it should have been part of the game release.Versus mode has had too much focus on it, which is why campaing is completely messed up. Tried to join versus, but spent most time sitting in lobby, looking for players, so far.Would also suggest anyone to look extremely critical at any other games by SEGA, as the company has so far ruined alot of good titles. This makes even the future of Alien: Isolation look grim...			"

												(full review at bleedingedgegaming.wordpress.com)If you’re not an Aliens fan, steer your money away from this game.  If you have spent every day since the first time you saw Aliens wanting a REAL sequel, you have just found your favorite teddy bear in the attic.  This is sixty dollars you will never miss or wish you had back in your pocket.  Any one of the fanboy watercooler moments in the last half of this game is worth the sticker price to a fan.  Hell, if you have the PC version and the settings maxed, the guy who owns the original cast of the “space jockey” now has nothing you haven’t had.  He spent millions and you still got to climb on it anyway.  Since I fall in category number two, this once I am going to have to beat down every journalistic standard I normally adhere to.  This game does not deserve this score by science, but this is how my heart felt.8/10			"

Most of this game is spent fighting humans, not aliens. In Colonial Marines: Aliens the real threat are PMCs. You might be asking ""So what separates CMA from Army of Two?"" That's an astute question, Jimmy. Facemasks, mostly.This game is a sequel to Aliens in the same way Rogue Warrior is a sequel to The Mighty Ducks.			"

												Aliens: Colonial Marines Review (PC)IntroGoing into Aliens: Colonial Marines, I had huge expectations.  With a developer such as gearbox attached to the the project, hopes were high for this FPS release..  Fans of the Aliens series were promised a true sequel to the James Cameron classic, and gamers were promised a cinematic, intense survival experience.  Early gameplay looked very promising, but Colonial Marines disappoints on almost every front.PresentationThe campaign places you in the shoes of Corporal Christopher Winter, a member of a search and rescue team sent in to investigate the U.S.S. Sulaco after the events of Aliens.  The setup is decent enough, but the story is nothing special, but no doubt veteran Aliens fans will want to see it through.  The opening cinematic is where the game's problems start.  It contains frighteningly low res texture and some awful lip syncing.  This set the tone for the rest of my experience.  Even running on max setting on a gaming PC, the textures look more like a last gen title rather than a beautiful HD current gen title.  Some of the levels do however have the creepy atmosphere you would expect from an Aliens title.  In regards to the lip syncing, it's mostly terrible.  While the voice acting is good enough, the dialogue just doesn't match the facial animations.  One of the only aspects of the presentation I really enjoyed was the sound effects.  The iconic dreadful beeping of the motion tracker and sounds of gunfire are accurate to the movie, and fans will appreciate that.GameplayThe campaign follows a simple linear level design, and it becomes repetitive very quickly.   After only an hour of gameplay, the game falls back on existing FPS conventions instead of doing anything interesting.  The game fails monumentally to create any survival horror tension by constantly loading the player with loads of ammo.  However, in the sewer level, this mechanic is taken out, and it works much better.  When your guns and immense firepower are taken away, Your really feel vulnerable.  There are a couple of good scares that couldn't have happened if you had access to all your weapons.  It's a shame the whole game doesn't feel like this.  Another gripe I had with the campaign is the A.I.  Rarely have I seen a game with artificial intelligence so bad.  Even when playing on the hardened mode, xenomorphs run directly at you and do not approach any situation intelligently.  When the game puts you up against the infamous Weyland Yutani corporation, the difficulty spikes.  Guns guns take you down much, much quicker than any alien in the game can.  It needs some serious balancing.  If there is one place where the game shines, its in its multiplayer.  While the standard team deathmatch mode is in place, modes such as escape and extermination provide exciting online experiences.  Escape is a 4v4 game mode with four xenomorphs hunting down four marines moving from point A to point B, while extermination pits four marines in a confined position to hold out as long as possible against four xenomorphs.  The game modes are mostly fun, but the xenomorphs feel terribly underpowered and once again the marines are given loads of ammunition, taking away much of the tension.ConclusionIt's really a shame Aliens: Colonial Marines couldn't be better.  With a developer like Gearbox behind the title, many were given false hope that the Aliens License would finally be put to good use..  Long development times are responsible for many of the games problems.  With lackluster A.I., forgettable gameplay, and downright atrocious visuals, this title is a disappointment to fans of the Alien series and gamers alike.Final Score: 3.75/10http://justinmadore.tumblr.com/post/69131996514/aliens-colonial-marines-written-review-pc "

												I, like many others, had very high hopes for this game and waited years for its release just to find out it wasn't exactly what was promised. That being said, I just played through from beginning to end and thoroughly enjoyed this title. I originally bought it for PS3 when it released, played for less than an hour, then got distracted by God knows what. Since then, I almost forgot it existed (it is rather forgettable). Then I saw it here for $4.99 and was like ""oh wow, that's right. That did come out last year"". I couldn't find my PS3 version so I went ahead and bought it for my rig.As much as I hate the combat, a bulk of the story, the ENDING of all things, the unbalanced AI, and the lack of background for Winter, this Colonial Marines kept me playing and was just FUN.So it isn't as polished as most AAA titles. So it isn't up to snuff, even by 2012-2013 standards (and especially not 2014). So almost nobody was happy with it. So what? I enjoyed it enough on my own that I'm gifting a copy to my friend because he's as big an Alien fanatic as I am and co-op looks like a blast.I mean, come on. We've all done way worse with $5 than entertain ourselves for half a day.			"

												This game was a huge let down... it was nothing like what we waited 6 YEARS for! So why do I recommend it? BugHunt. The BugHunt DLC is the most fun I've ever had in a co-op mode EVER! It's sucha  blast, especially if you're playing with a group of friends who like Aliens. Add the Movie Skins, play on the tribute map and bingo jyou've got a ton of fun! Also a small group of madders have already taken out W-Y mercs and the dino aliens and have added Crushers and Boliers in at wave 30! Basically modders have made the mode the ULTIMATE Aliens experience and you should give it a chance next time it's super cheap! But you gotta buy BugHunt... it's just that good.			"

												Overall: 8/10Ok. I pre-ordered this game (for PS3), got the collectors edition, and bought the season pass day one. All told I spent $100 dollars on this game ($105 now that I have it on Steam as well), and I must say that I feel all of the negative reviews to be a little bogus. I have beaten the single player campaign twice via co-op and once by myself, and spent countless hours in multi-player. I have played this game alot.It is a good game, but not a great game. Maybe I was just lucky, but I have never had any of the glitches people talk about with this game, so its important to stress that they are not going to happen 100% of the time. I was really confused by all the glitch talk when the game first came out, to be honest, because nothing like that happened to me or my co-op buddy and we played through beginning to end on day one after going to the midnight launch. I've seen video, so I know they exist, but you are not guaranteed to see them.Second, game-play is very standard shooter fare. But then again, its a shooter. You shoot things. The Aliens come at you from all angles, and you shoot them. Alot like the movie. No idea what the complaint here is. The guns sound awesome, the aliens go down about how you would expect, and the blood even harms you. Seems pretty straight forward. I think alot of people expected a splash of blood to kill you outright like in the movies, but that would just be unfun, unless it was some higher difficulty setting or something. You are a highly trained bad♥♥♥♥♥and you feel like it. Definitely more of a Halo than a survival horror game, but its what I expected. Maybe if you expected horror, you would be disappointed, but I knew this was a shooter from the moment I pre-ordered it.Third, the attention to detail in the levels was cool. It was awesome to walk through the movie interiors, and everything felt like it should. Of course, according to plot the whole place was nuked, but this game is fan-service and nothing else about the plot makes sense, so why should this? I would rather have the fan-service moment and just enjoy it than ♥♥♥♥♥ about plot for a series not really known for its nuanced plots to begin with.To sum up, I think that this game was exactly what I expected, and delivered everything I felt I was promised. Of course I went in expecting an 8/10 and I got roughly an 8/10. Some people I feel were mislead by cinematic trailers (the bane of the industry) and the hype machine, but really, what else could a movie tie-in game go but mediocre. There have been less than a handful of good movie games, and this is definitely in that category. Go in with realistic expectations, and you will have fun and that's the whole purpose.			"

Though take note that it doesnt exactly make sense nore follow the story thats in between the 2nd and 3rd alien movie; some parts make sense and the other parts dont make sense so for the warning, dont beleive some parts and believe the other parts that make sense between the 2nd and 3rd movie. Serious action and scary galore! Best game when it comes to hunting down ""bugs""!  A PERFECT shoot em up when you are bored.			"

												I was realy looking forward to this game. Sadly it is falwed, buggy and boring. What enrages me the most is the way the marketed the game. The gameplay footage they showed was awesome, but was apparently built in another engine and rendered separately. So what they showed and sold the game with looked much more cooler than the product they released. Do not buy this game, do not support this game. I regret I wasted so much money on pre-ordering this game. I certainly learned my lesson about game corporations and how they try to hype their games with lies.			"

												Well now that I've been playing gearbox's attempt at the aliens franchise for a year, yes I would say give this a shot. Even after it's bad press and flaws. I've been playing aliens games since the early 90s and this is by far not the worst game out there. Yes it has some flaws and some more after that, However it has come a long way since it's release last Febuary. On top of that the DLC ""Stasis Interrupted"" is not too shabby in explaining the events that led up to the game. Along with a throw back to Alien 3. The multiplayer is fast paced and I haven't gotten enough of it yet. So over all I would buy this just for multiplayer alone. It's not AVP classic 2000 but it's worth it.....I give this game as an alien franchise fan a thumbs up!			"

												Was pretty sad to see what happened to this game. It had the chance to be something big. But in the end fell short of it all. The Alien A.I was slow and really walked into the attacks instead of fleaing and trying to hunt me. THe Pictures and video previews are all a lie, at max graphics the game does not look that good on any computer. And finally the story... there was so many ways they could have gone with this and the story in the end was one direction and a very plain plot causing you not to care about the characters. Also they had a big name actor help voice in this and all it sounded like was a phone conversation, dry and uninspired. If this game came out with a mod then maybe the people could make this something better. But for now I give it a 1 out of 10.			"

												This game was a huge let down... it was nothing like what we waited 6 YEARS for! So why do I recommend it? BugHunt. The BugHunt DLC is the most fun I've ever had in a co-op mode EVER! It's sucha  blast, especially if you're playing with a group of friends who like Aliens. Add the Movie Skins, play on the tribute map and bingo jyou've got a ton of fun! Also a small group of madders have already taken out W-Y mercs and the dino aliens and have added Crushers and Boliers in at wave 30! Basically modders have made the mode the ULTIMATE Aliens experience and you should give it a chance next time it's super cheap! But you gotta buy BugHunt... it's just that good.			"

												Now to be completely honest I understand why everyone is disappointed by this title,and well they should be.It is not as like they made it look at E3, at all.Now for the actual gameplay, well I actually kinda liked it.Its not bad and yes the AI is pretty clunky from time to time.Aliens run at you completely revealing themselves with no stealth factor and the WYU mercs are bullet sponges taking a bunch of damage and still being able to shoot back at you.I completed this game in COOP and played some versus which is pretty good,although the animations could be better.Critics have tore this game apart with negative comments and everyone else got on the bandwagon along.There has been numerous patches where some issues have been fixed so you wont be dealing with them.AI was never patched but there are a couple of mods that have reworked the game and made it much more enjoyable (TemplarGFX's mod).If you are an Alien fan,have played the previous games,and if you can look past some of the problems then I must say get this game.Its honestly not as bad as people say it is.It is meant to be a AAA title but it comes out as an average game and does a pretty neat job at it.My final verdict for this game would be a decent 7/10 "

												It took me a very long time to finally realize how terrible this game truly is. I give up.Aliens Colonial Marines fails on so many levels. The game has terrible graphics, it's dark, murky, washed out and visually boring. The gameplay is flat and lifeless. The story is god awful you swear Gearbox hired a 7 year old to write the script. Plot holes after more plot holes, treating the players as if they are stupid.Zero atmosphere, at no point did you feel the tension or fear for your life. If you didn't think it could get worse the MP matchmaking is completely broken. If you want to play you have to join a group of players and drop what you're doing to go play with them or else you'll completely miss your opportunity to play online. F--k Gearbox, what they did is unforgivable, they lied to the fans, nuff said. Only thing ACM got right was the sound effects and music, everything else was complete crap.Aliens Colonial Marines was made by unprofessional ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who only care about getting paid and f--k what the fans want. 2/10.

That and how many of them end up as incubators makes you wonder if they signed on with Greenpeace before shipping out.Ever try hitting buttons to skip being forcefed a non-interactive dialogue?

												I love this game.  The graphics are pleasing even if they are a little dated.  Co-op story mode is always a good thing.  The sounds seemed to be pulled straight from the movies (love that pulse rifle burp).  The radio chatter drew me into the game and made the linear story easy to digest.  The difficulty is punishing yet felt fair to me.  When I made too many mistakes I paid the price and had to go back to the drawing board, but this made completion of a section much more satisfying.  All in all, the game has aged well (in my eyes) and was a real joy.			"

												There are a lot of negative reviews for this game and I can see why. But as a die hard fan of the series, with friends who play it, I think it's a lot of fun. I've seen some reviews where the game crashes or gets stuck in a weird loop of closing and restarting itself but it hasn't so much as stuttered for me. It's Aliens: Colonial Marines, not Aliens: The Definitive RPG. You're a meathead soldier on a meathead quest. It was always going to be just a shooter. If you really love the franchise, it's worth the 15 bucks. Or wait for a sale. I find it a lot of fun.			"

												I have owned ACM since release on 360 (despite the BS hype problems). im more than aware of its problems. I am still fond of it though. Sadly i cant recommend it in its native state. It looks like a PS2 game threw up on doom 2. I have played it to death and got every achievement so i can tell you for a fact that I have spent enough time to see all it has to offer.Graphically... nah, it looks awful.Gameplay... nah, aliens struggle to attack anyone but player and marines couldnt care less.Sound... oh god no. overlapping audio clips and constant pulse rifle drone. and i love the pulse rifle noise.so this is why ill recommend it... TemplarGFX. looks great, reworks everything. it is fantastic. makes the game worth it all. its tragic that a mod is what it takes to make this game good. it should be better from the start.			"

												You hear the sound of wet vomiting splashing against a window, punctuated by the umistakably harsh weeping of grown men.  Somewhere, a dog is howling at an empty vase.  A large tick crawls out of a salt shaker, glaring at you with contempt.  Giant ants stumble drunkenly into walls and seemingly forget their purpose, they being to question the rationale of their existence.  A sweaty woman shoots paper flowers out of an automatic rifle.   An aircraft with no bottom slowly ascends into the heavens, only to be ripped apart by unseen forces, and then slowly falls, piece by piece as the chunks slowly dissolve into glowing green squares.  Your wallet feels lighter. Somewhere, Randy Pitchford is laughing.			"

Great and i repeat great audio, being that ambiant sounds, gun shots or voice acting. Graphically it doesn't break any ground but it does look good.Overall it's a great game at that price and any AVP or/and Alien fan should get it and play it at least once.			"

												This game is a mixed bag after it's horrible release, all the way to the current status with lot's of patches and DLC:s + graphics adjustments available to PC. However after many patches this game actually is pretty okay. Albeit the characters are shallow, Aliens still look and act glitchy and like puppets, although the enemy AI is improved somewhat. I'm not gonna lie and say this is a great game, it's not, but it's not the most awful game I've played either now with the patches. In a way I'm tempted to say that this is only for most hardcore fans but then again, it's exactly those who this game is most likely to disappoint due to expectations not going to be met. Maybe I would recommend this for someone completely unaware to aliens and who does not care for plot or atmosphere but is rather looking for simple shooter mechanics. I personally like some of the DLC maps and with friends it can be even fun. You just need to adjust your mindset for acm and absolutely throw expectations out the window.This game had a lot of potential and in a weird way it kind of shows through the ugly cracks.. You can see (at least with the mega patches) That there was somekind of genuine effort to save this game. There are so many nods to the franchise and touches here and there, which all would be AWESOME had the game not been halfassed in development. If this game had what Alien Isolation has this game would trump all over it. But it's the production values that let this puppy down. Everything feels unfinished or dated. The story feels rushed, unimaginative and hardly does justice to the films, even when it has the genuine characters and surroundings. Quite frankly, the story feels like it's written by someone who does not care for the movies or simply is untalented..-ADDED after playing DLC-Thankfully here is where the excellent Stasis Interrupted DLC comes in and saves this whole game for me. The story, the atmosphere, even the level design is on a whole new level when compared to the normal campaign! I couldn't believe what a difference! The dreadful story holes are explained so that the story of this ties way more smoothly to Aliens saga and ties it all into the ending of Alien 3 too. In a not too bad way I think, albeit still far from perfect. The AI too seems ways better or then it's the way the levels are designed that push the enemy to flank you and surprise you in new ways. At least in ultimate badass mode. The problem however is the shortness of the DLC in comparison to the already short campaign of the main game. However I must say that I find this DLC redeeming this game enough for me to change it's status from not recommended to a RECOMMENDED for fans! In the stasis you even get some of that character development that was dreadfully missing from the main game. You start to feel something for characters. It's basically a new game in the shell of the main game, however tying into it's mechanics and story arch. So the Stasis Interrupted DLC is GOOD in my books.. Obviously it's still limited by the technology of the original ACM so don't expect miracles, but there was effort to correct what could be done without rewriting the whole game. Sadly complete rewrite IS what would be needed for win.-DLC bit ends-Now back to the MAINGAME review:The other thing in MAIN GAME is the nonexistant character develompent which is closer to someone's home movie in direction and in complexity of character. Lousy voice acting, bad writing.. The Characters alone make this game a failure. Even if it had super graphics, the characters would♥♥♥♥♥♥you off. Something that ties in here with the characters is the AI which is broken, even with the patches it feels no good. Your guys will help you getting killed but DO NOT HELP you in any other way. It's not uncommon for O'neal to stand in your way, blocking door acces without shooting any enemies, while you begging him to let you through to get to cover from onslaught of bullets flying your way. This is definitely a game where friendly fire would be a good thing. O'neil needs to be capped off on many occasions..Or then he spouts embarassing commentary right out of a generic shooter while shooting at walls or crates even when the enemy is standing right in front of him. This game would be a better game if you'd be completely alone, rather than having your company ruin atmospehere and gameplay for you.Obviously that's not how this game was designed to be, as you are a colonial marine. But that's the other thing. They had the idea of making you a part of a 'team' but then they don't even give you team. For the most part it's just you and some other marine, making your 'colonial marine squad' a band of 2 all the time with some short exceptions. You never feel like a marine in the single player.The other 'marines' are puppets hanging in the background and having one animation or grunt. In one mission you had to search and rescue these other marines and they were completely lifeless and soulles like zombies when you rescue them. Not even eyes or mouths were moving when you save their LIFE, and then they disappear like the bodies do in the game so your'e left alone again. At least by modifying .ini values you can force the corpses to stay but in a way, why would you want that? It's better that they disappear from ruining your mood (irony)Yet for some inane bizarre reason I've grown to like this game somewhat. Maybe it's like those b-scifi movies that are so bad it's kind of good.. Or I'm just crazy.On pc there are ways to make this game look better graphically and I would say WAY better in terms of atmosphere and lighting so you only end up disliking the rest in the end. I think since I've adjusted the graphics so that the locations look cool and atmospheric is the reason why I like this game now, with all it's gut wrenching flaws. Since the locations are the only thing they nailed in making this game (as far as old ut3 engine allows) It's now bringing back memories from the movie. Also MP levels have great design and nods to the movies, even nostromo is there although not part of the James Cameron version of the movie. Now that I've said a few positive comments, it's time again to burst the bubble on this game. The aliens suck bigtime. They are like puppets with dumb AI and only resemble by fraction the scary killing beast they were in the movies. They remind me of a zoo simulation where apes are running towards you and jumping up and down, getting stuck on walls and whatnot or just standing there with their butts towards you waiting for you to cap them off. Also there is no interaction with them whatsoever. They seem not even knowing you're unloading a clip at them, there's no reaction until the death animation kicks in. It makes them feel autobots rather than the scariest beast in the universe. Although this too changes in the Stasis Interrupted DLC where I suddenly felt anxious about an alien encounter. They should have focused wholly on aliens in the main game and spare the troopers of Weyland Yutani corp. to the DLC because here THEY FIT RIGHT IN to the story. In a not as terrible way! The story is told and moved along better. And it's great how the frantic fighting between them and aliens is made in, allowing you to be a rogue surprise for both aliens and humans.Multiplayer is fun too, that's the good part I find with this game, the MP Escape missions for instance where your frantically trying to get to a rescue ship while battling hordes of enemies and your team tries to open heavy doors and stuff while combating their way and healing downed marines because there's safety in numbers is fun to me. These matches get hectic and with the original sounding soundtrack booming in the background your heartrate may actually start to rise out of something else than just frustration.This game is not fun straight out of the box but it can grow on you.

												It's interesting, I watched the Angry Joe review when it first came out, and the game didn't look that impressive or anything, so I didn't feel like buying the game. However, I have now sense recently bought the game on PC on sale with DLC. And my thoughts? ...I think it's a really good game. Maybe it's the patches and DLC that really help the game. Because now we have the Bughunt gamemode, really great HD textures, and new maps to work with. Besides that, the music is great, the weapons are fantastic, the atmosphere is really good, and the campaign isn't that bad, hell, even Soldier difficulty now seems to be more difficult. The bughunt is great because now, you really don't know where an alien is coming. You pretty much HAVE to use the motion tracker and that really helped immerse me into the game's world more. Also, here's my biggest argument or praise is, please bare with me on this... the Alien AI. Again, maybe it was a patch, but the alien AI is fan-♥♥♥♥ing-tastic. They use the walls, climb on the ceilings like all the time, they hide into ducts and go under the floors, etc. They're AI is great. They really make use of their environment to their full advantage. So props to you Gearbox and SEGA for that.Try this game out and judge it for yourself. That's what I did. I think it's a really fun game. Is it worth $60? Hell no. Is it worth like $20 or 30$? Yes yes yes.			"

												Atheeeeeensiun Muhreens.yes, it could have been atleast 75% better and the co-op is a bit messy with teleporting and sharing armour and running around with AI controlled smartgun-wielding Mr. Tank..but.. Its fun anyway. The design of all the 80s sci-fi♥♥♥♥♥♥is really nice, and there are a lot of cool animations. During my playthrough, I haven't really ran into any bugs or ""dumb"" AI.My main issues are still the fact that despite playing with 2 other people (or 3) there will still be your trusty bullet sponge coming with you, denying any real feeling of danger or true cooperative play. Not only that, but its really sad that customising your character and weapon is limited to the versus mode, something that could have been perfectly intergrated in the normal game.oh, and the menus are a cluster♥♥♥♥.

												Personally, I think this game is made worse by its critics than it really is. Sure it was garbage upon release but there have been major patches and the quality is acceptable if you buy it on sale. Besides that, Aliens (the 2nd movie) was obviously a spin-off of the first movie and is therefore much more action oriented. If you want some survival horror, go check out (the awesome) Alien Isolation. But that does not mean, that you can't enjoy the 6-7 hours of campaign in Aliens Colonial Marines. I understand that early buyers are frustrated, but buying it now on sale is absolutely worth it.I recommend it on sale.			"

												So...aliens Colonial marines...due to the reviews and release horrors i put off on playing this game and rightfully so at the time.Now that 99% if not 100% of the patches have been deployed i decided to pick the game up and give it an honest chance. Now mind you my review is based off of going in expecting the ABSOLUTE worst (as all other reviews portrayed the game AS)i was...pleasently surprised...(angry mob before you hunt me down hear me out)Okay so this game is by no means what the hype led us to believe and from that point the game failed horrible however going in expecting the worse and keeping those reviews out of your head while playing, even you would be surprised. Ill just make my case in the pros and cons, and then finish in the wrap upPros:-design : All areas are very nostalgic and are wonderful recreations of the movie itself. the lighting (albeit nowhere near as awesome as the tech demo/reveal) is well placed and still presents an eerie feeling, especially in the sewers.-gun feel: the guns feel innacurate at times however you will quickly adjust and feel like a Bad @$$ gunning down the new and improved xenos with a smart gun, shotgun, or even the iconic pulse rifle. (ai has been sorta kinda fixed and the damage they do is...significant. a single xeno can get behind you and eff your armor and health up rather quickly and then jump away making it hard to deal with)-Voice Acting: the random banter in the audio logs can be funny, even the random bits with the marines are well voiced and provide some fairly decent...i wanna say immersion but...im gonna go with provides a decent experience and conveys each situation fairly well.-enemy design: The Xeno's are all very well designed including the new species. they look creepy as can be, even intimidating at times. The Raven mission has some of the BEST scares in the game and truly felt like what the entire game should have been. (aside from the bug during the boss fight when you reload the checkpoint)Thats all i can think of for the pros at the moment, onto the cons!Cons:-Over hyped: The trailers and playable demos at the press events/ conventions got us way over hyped and every single company behind it should be held responsible. blame does not lay soley upon one party in this situation. the devs shouldnt have released it in a broken state, they shouldnt have taken the tech demo/presentation out of the game, and of course the publishers should have used a Quality Assurance team to test the freakin game BEFORE it was released. there was no reason it should have been let out the doors in that state.-AI: both the marine, WaYu troops, and even the xenos  at times(although they seem to have been improved from launch) all have very horrible ai. at launch the xenos were a joke, thank god they fixed it (as far as i can tell, i see less of them standing around and more actually getting in my face tearing me a new one on Ultimate Badass (only difficulty woth playing) As for the Friendly Marine AI...ha...yeah just go in expecting to do everything one man army style. -Characters: a few characters shouldnt have been introduced the way they were, we should have been able to build up a relationship before we knew they were doomed and a specific character shouldnt have even been in the freakin game, they died in the movie.-gun feel?: as i said you will quickly adjust to the way the guns operate however only a few of the weapons are truly worth using at all. the pulse rifle is fantastic, both shotguns are great. smg, br, and even the ar are all rubbish so forget them. Also a personal gripe for me, i wanted to use the smart gun more often, the game wasnt complete easy mode with it (especially on UB difficulty) so i feel we should have been able to use it a little more often. some sections felt like it needed it more than others.-final boss: tense but at the same time a joke...its too easy once you figure out how to trick the ai (gee another ai problem, imagine that)Anyway, onto the wrap up!Aliens colonial marines is a good buy, especially at $15, however to truly enjoy the game, you need the stasis interrupted and the bug-hunt dlc's Those truly improve the game HOWEVER you should ONLY buy them on SALE!This game is hated on far too much, i have played way worse shooters in my life and the only reason people hate on this game so much is they gave into the hype, the company basically lied about what was in the game, and at release the entire game was a total joke. HOWEVER that has for the most part been fixed, atleast in my experience. People will be surprised if they approach this game while ignoring the hype. as i stated before, i came in expecting the absolute worst but...the game really isnt. its by no means the best game ever, it does not truly do the franchise justice, but it is a decent enough addition to any alien fans libray.This is an average game, a 5/10 on AJ's score system. It is worth a buy ON SALE ONLY, do not pick this game up at full price, the multiplayer is very dead now, so i cannot include that in my review.			"

												I bought this game to be happyas the title was too catchy.Its developer was famous and dependablebut their product soon became expendable.I was not a hater, did not start a petitionbut simply purchased the collector's edition.The game started up, I began my journeyI soon found the story a big baloney.I hate you Gearbox, you let me downI wanted a game you could not get me, why?Poem aside, Colonial Marines is mediocre at best. Below bulletpoints are my findings which are based on the completed campaign (with almost all the achievements attained there save for the ones of the campaign DLC) and I must also mention no multiplayer session was found when trying to look for parties online for a possible coop campaign or team deathmatch.+++ The game looks and feels good. Yeah I know there are videos comparing the gameplay trailer and the actual gameplay footage and there was the lawsuit filed against the publisher or developer. In fact, they also blamed each other for this and Kotaku has an article of all this mess but it's just best to forget about it. Development took quite many years - this is one of those games that went through a development hell and as a result of this critics ripped the game apart.+++ I do believe the atmosphere is right there where it should be. The sound effects are all great and there are many areas borrowed directly from Aliens. You can traverse through Hadley's Hope, for instance, and if you are an Aliens fan you'll recognise some of the rooms, vehicles and even Bishop turns up as a vital member of your team.- - - Aaaaaaaaaaand pretty much that's it. Everything else is bad. The game gives you an awful lot of chance to fight the soldiers of Weyland-Yutani. I did not like where they went with the story. Fighting the xenomorphs is good but sometimes it seems awkward (i.e. glitchy) - especially the 2 boss fights with bigger aliens. And then you have the encounter with the queen which is a complete letdown. And all this in the name of a story that is meant to be canon... to bridge Aliens with Alien 3.- - - Again, we have a 6-7 hour long campaign which is not much. If they highlighted the greatness of story during advertising why couldn't they give us a longer adventure? You team up with some marines and go together which obviously is an indication of a coop campaign. It is not necessarily bad but the AI controlling our fellow soldiers is not that good. Sometimes they are a pain and they can spawn at certain points quickly once you have advanced the story. An upside is that they cannot be downed so you do not spend any time with reviving them. In any case, playing in coop mode is probably much better than alone.Colonial Marines was a letdown. The game has an excellent design and brings back a lot of memorable places / events from Aliens (not to mention the dog tags you are looking for or the so-called legendary weapons you can find e.g. Hicks' shotgun) but playing a tribute is not enough to create a decent game. It is a good homage but a mediocre game that should have been properly finished.			"

												They said this game would look best on the WiiU. I am guessing what they were trying to say is that the way the game looks on the WiiU is as best as it's going to get. They KNEW it was bad.Before you decide to buy this game, I would advise you to take a careful look at the screenshots of this game on Steam or elsewhere. Looks good, right? Crisp, sharp, good lightening, decent textures. Well, that's not how the game looks. Either that, or they really did some good work on making the best possible screenshots to deceive the public.The fire looks terrible and so does the smoke, the explosions and the water. The textures up close date back to 2004 at least. The broken glass windows break into several small pieces when shot and disappear in mid air. The dead aliens disappear too in their puddle of blood within 4 seconds. It also says the game uses PhysX but I don't see it. I found out that the game is supposed to be using next gen lightening, but I didn't see it either. Actually, I know that cannot be true since this game uses DX9 and the 2010 AVP used DX11. Talk about taking a step back. You can't see your legs but at least you cast a show [with legs].......Courtesy of the Unreal Engine 3 that frankly won't die and that is being kept on life support at this point.There's no friendly fire, so when one of your buddies get surrounded by the xenos, then just spray left and right until the last xeno dies. There is no carefulness nor any meticulous shooting involved at all. The ammo is mostly plentiful but fear not! The melee button is there to save the day but more on that later.Paradoxically speaking the 2010 AVP's graphics excel these my a huge margin. I understand it's the different developer but damn! Regardless, both of these games are a far cry from AVP 2 which is still the best game in the ""series"" and possibly one of the best games ever made (retro-wise, at least).The physics are horrendous. The aliens look like they however when they crawl on the walls, but at least they can jump ahead once again (even that looks sloppy especially when they sometimes rotate 180 degrees mid air). When you step on their acid, you don't get hurt. When they rush, you just melee them (like in 2010 AVP) and see a nice little auto-aim animation even if you are six feet away. First you are here, and then you press the melee button and you are right in front of the alien, and the two of you are literally having a boxing match, which you will always win. Remember that from the movie? And when you play on the hardest difficulty and die you just start from the last checkpoint (unlike from the beginning of the level like in AVP 2). When you play without the cross-hair, the red cross-hair still appears when you are shooting the alien. Why? I don't want cross-hair and I don't want the in-built auto-assist either, I'm using a mouse, thank you very much.All in all, this game seems to forget that the aliens barely, if ever, attacked in force. They are cunning creatures that hide in the dark, that flank you, that surround you and then attempt to capture you alive if possible. What they do in this game is simply rush you from many directions. There is barely any tension involved. Any build up of anticipation for the next fire-fight is practically nonexistent, because in truth, the xenos are pretty easy to kill. I remember that in AVP 2 two Xenos could take you out on easiest difficulty in seconds. The solution for this game? more xenos. Oh, and don't forget about having to fight waves of human and droid enemies too. Remember THAT from the movie?Co-op doesn't save the day. There's barely any ""Co-Op"" to begin with. Just running around, getting into each other's line of fire, and trying to kill as many xenos for experience to use for your next gun, remember that in the movie? Remember the marines being all psyched for the next alien encounter?I also love it how Steam says it's a 20 GB game making you think that it's gonna be a huge game with rich textures, long campaign and decent multiplayer. However, when you start downloading the game, it only weights around 6-7GB. Watch out, I guess it's gonna be a short campaign! and then...game over, man. I am trying to be funny which is a self-defense mechanism since I have just shelled out $ 50 for this tripe.There are also bugs. Sometimes you see human enemy AI stuck. Then when you approach them they start shooting you. When you die and reload the checkpoint those very same enemy AIs are gone.In the very least, this is an arcade shooting game, with decent sound, where you get to shoot aliens, and people while upgrading your arsenal, err...right? If you want a better, longer, cheaper and much more interesting campaign, play the Marine Campaign in AVP 2 (2001).OR, you can wait until they finish that Crysis 2 -Aliens vs Marine mod which will probably be free anyway, so save your money, pickles.P.S. Spoiler or not, the scene with the Marine who decides to blow himself up with a grenade and endanger his friends as well as the ship was really stupid. Way to go, bro, take out your brothers with you.""Semper Fi, do or die""I guess DIE. Welcome to DIE.			"

												This game gets a lot of bad press, but it really isn't as bad as people make out. It can be a lot of fun in co-op campaign and the multiplayer is pretty good too with some interesting game modes and cool mechanics for the aliens to use.The story of the campaign is a little underwhelming, although the Stasis Interrupted DLC has a decent story and also helps to explain how Hicks got back to LV426. The main campaign all comes down to a final boss battle which is pretty awful and could really do with some modifications, but it's not the worst thing in the world.My least favourite thing about this game is the ""boss battle"" half-way through the campaign. You have to try and defeat this ""Raven"" with a powerloader and the mechanics to do so are completely broken. It takes a good few tries to pass this short section and it can get incredibly frustrating even on easy difficulties - it's the closest I've ever been in a game to breaking my controller.I've played through the game's campaign and multiplayer matches on PC and Xbox 360 and in my opinion the PC version is a lot better than the console release. This is most likely down to the big patch that released after the game's negative reception. The patch mainly worked on fixing graphical stuff, but I think it did do some tweaks to AI as well.The best thing about this game is a new mod (hence my updated review) by the name of ""TemplarGFX's ACM Overhaul"". A modder took it upon himself to spend months working through the config files of the game to rebalance weapons, improve LOD settings and fix up the AI and textures. Playing with this mod enabled, even in the early stages of its development, is a massive improvement to the core game mechanics as well as the graphical side of things. Xenomorphs are actually smart, using the walls and sneaking around instead of just leaping at you to attack. The W-Y soldiers are now easier to kill and are all independent meaning that as soon as one spots you, they don't all spot you. This makes gameplay much more fluid and can allow for you to actually approach sections with stealth making for some interesting alternative survival options. I'm very excited to see what else this mod will do (it's still in early access at the moment) and major thanks to the developer for improving the game significantly!TL;DR ... The game is good enough for co-op and can be a fun experience, but the best way to play is on PC with the new ""TemplarGFX"" mod which improves AI, textures and more. I'd still wait for a sale though.			"

With the narrow corridors, everything being dark and smoky, and all the backgrounds varying shades of grey, it makes you feel like you are in a... well... Moving on, regardless of opinion, the game is virtually unplayable. You are on an exploding spaceship, so every second or so, when aiming, the cursor will move all over violently, also your character is having a never ending diabetic seizure because he cant stop twitching either, great combo so even if you could see anything, you will barely be able to hit anything.The season pass is useless, it comprises online multiplayer DLC, looking at the steamgraph and from my own experience I have never found one other person online to play deathmatch or any of these other modes with.

												I don't want to waste too much time on this crappy game so I'll just give you a few pros and cons:+ Decent voice acting and sounds+ Atmosphere (most of the times)+ Somewhat lengthy (but not enjoyable)+- Mediocre graphics (I expected DNF graphics after reading so many (user) reviews, so I was a bit surprised when I started playing myself. While they're not THAT bad, they're not sharp or pretty either but get the job done)- Terrible gameplay (it's a generic shooter all the way), shooting feels unsatisfying- Glitches, clipping issues, uneven checkpoints, terrible AI, difficulty spikes (i.e. unpolished)- Repetitive environments (I had a few sections that were exact duplicates of some of the earlier sections. If it wasn't for the objectives I probably would've quit the game and level select my way to the correct one. Confusing♥♥♥♥♥♥).- It tries to be scary, but there are so many aliens and soldiers walking around that it simply isn't any scary... Wasted potential.All I can say is; strike two Gearbox... Strike two...[Rating: 55/100]			"

												Everyone has already said everything about this stinker so I will keep it short.This game is a insult to gamers and to fans of the aliens movies.The story is bad fanfiction, even a 12-year-old wouldn´t write, with enough holes in it to fit the Sulaco through, sideways.The visuals are dated. The AI is borderline retared. The game is riddled with bugs.Your Sidekicks are unlikable A-holes that drool exposition, get in your way and annoy the hell out of you.Aliens, once scary and menacing, are nothing more than stupid cannonfodder, acting without ANY intelligence.I would hate the game less, if they hadn´t hyped it up the butt. But Randy Pitchford got me with the cool, BUT TOTALLY FAKED, Trailer.The only postitive thing I have to say about it is, that the musical score is very good and the weapons are quite cool.Stay away from it....!Stay AWAY!

												Seeing all the negative reviews, I was prepared for the worst. As a franchise fan I bought it anyway. The game itself very pleasantly surprised me. I must admit that I have not seen the game at the release time, but I do not understand the still prevailing hate around it. Most of the bugs are fixed and I had fun, even more than other ""top rated"" FPS that are calling you to duty, giving you medals of honor, etc. I even bought the story DLC, which is a nice refreshment with different gameplay elements.If you are an Alien-universe fan and want to visit the places from your favorite movies (such as Hadley's Hope, derelict spacecraft, etc.), I can reccomend this. If you are afraid of the negative reviews, wait for sale, but with the current possibility of steam refunds, there is IMHO no serious reason not to give it a try.			"

												Unfortunately this game has received a lot of bad publicity, mostly due to the way it was falsely advertised before release, which is a shame, because ""Aliens: Colonial Marines"", isn't all that bad.Pros:Simple shoot 'em up gameplay, In game challenges add a level of difficulty and sense of achievement.Gun customisation available.Storyline is interesting (Although the cinematics are pretty cringe-worthy)Co-op for up to 4 players on CampaignCons:AI behaviour is honestly terrible. If you're the type of person that'll be deeply disturbed by very unintelligent, artificial intelligent enemies, do not get this game.Multiplayer aspect is almost non-existent, which is ashame because it looks like it has a lot of potential. If there was actual online content, this would be in the 'Pros' section, as I'm sure it would be quite enjoyable.Slightly repetitive.If you're looking for a fun, simple shoot 'em up game, Aliens: Colonial Marines is a game you'll enjoy, but this game is worth no more than $10. If you're interested in this game, buy it when it's on sale.EDIT - I will however mention that the vast majority of players are going to dislike this game, especially the Alien fanboys, simply because this game came no where near close to it's expectations and promises. If you are able to look past what was expected and just shoot things with your mates, it doesn't turn out so bad after all. (okay maybe it does)			"

												One of the best games I have played in a while.I first preordered this on PS3 for £40 and was not disappointed when I played this game, I played it so much that I broke my PS3, I must have played in excess of 400 hours on it. When PS3 broke, I bought this for £14.99 and also bought the season pass for £20 and have only clocked a few hours on this game due to problems with steam, but now i am up and running perfectly, I shall not be seeing the outside of my house until September. A must buy for any fan of FPS or the Alien franchise.			"

												I wanted to write this review for a very long time...This game was played on purely coop, I got 2 other friends who love coop games as well.Guess what, when the game first came out we didnt buy it as it was 50 USD,, too expensive for us, and whenit dropped to 5 usd during a midweek sale, we almost gave it a miss as the reviews really jacked this game to thebottom.Im very glad we bought the game. really good coop. there ARE bugs, I think once or twice the NPC got stuckand we had to restart, but seriously, its no biggie. The guns react the game in the movies, the scares are good.Aliens feel like a challenge and we enjoyed the coop storyline throughout the entire game.We completed it... only grip was that the end so aburupt. But if you have 2 other friends. Grab this title asthe coop they have is really good.I recommend this to ONLY PEOPLE who wanna play due to the coop factor.			"

												I got into all of the hype for this game and then all of the negative reviews after launch for its state of completion and polish, or lack of. But it's 2016 and I decided to give it a chance and I must say, it's really not that bad. Im sure they patched the crap out of it since launch but I don't care, the first act is FANTASTIC, the second act is ok, and the end if a little lack luster. This was a solid game with a better story than most FPS. The enemy AI is a little weak, that and some of the voice acting are my only complaints… but if those things kill a game for you then you can NEVER enjoy most games that get made now days. I know its popular to blast the game for its launch conditions but honestly this game is fine now and worth a buy at current normal price.			"

												I bought this game just to check out what everyone was complaining about.  Yep, it has some cheesy graphics that look really outdated.  Doesn't look to bad if you max the graphic settings out.  Game play is ok but not amazing.  It's got it's share of bugs for sure.  For some sick reason I'm enjoying playing it SP and co-op.  Dunno why but it's true.  Highly recommended?  No.  Avoid it?  No.  I think it takes a certain kind of player to enjoy this.  Some will hate it, some will love it, and some will enjoy it for what it is.  If you want to take the risk and see it's up to you.  Whatever you do GET IT CHEAP!			"

												I'm saying yes to recommending this game with one very important caveat, you will most likely only enjoy this if you are a fan of the Alien series (this is supposed to be considered a direct sequel to Aliens) as I am. Even being a fan, the only thing I enjoyed about this game was the basic idea they had for the sequel. The story, at its core, had the potential to be amazing, but crappy dialogue (including voice acting) and a somewhat ""rushed"" feeling at the end kills what could have been an amazing story.As for gameplay, it is pretty much as generic as any first person shooter can get, nothing really revolutionary here. The enemies are weak, especially the aliens themselves. They die in a few bursts from your chosen weapon, even on the hardest difficulty level. If you shoot an alien point blank, the ""acid blood"" barely causes any damage at all. There are only a handful (and that is probably generous) of moments in the game where you are actually being stalked by the aliens, those are especially fun moments, as short lived as they are.In closing, if you're not a fan of the Alien saga then you probably will not enjoy this game in the least. If you are, then you will at least get a glimpse of what could have been, before it was butchered.			"

												5 out of 5 for all the right reasons.I have never reviewed a game before, but I'm going out of my way for this one because it deserves to be defended.The game is not mind blowingly spectacular. It's not a high end, maximum graphic type game.HOWEVER, what the game does have is gameplay that keeps you highly entertained and that's what I paid for.The COOP is perfect, arming 4 Marines in a war against Aliens and mercenaries. The weapons upgrade system is minimal but leaves you feeling satisfied when add new attachments and skins to your guns.The A.I. isnt terrible and on the Ultimate Badass it's quite fun with 4 people waging war against the Aliens.I do not have the DLC's however I am told they only make the game better than it already it is.Long story short, people give this game a bad rap because they are expecting a major title type game. That just isnt the case here, but rest assured, it's a fantastic game and I'd pay for it again if I had a do-over. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a highly addictive and action packed COOP game.			"

												Aliens.......1986Review of Aliens: Colonial Marines for PC.Some games you either love or hate. Aliens: Colonial Marines is that kind of game. Made by Gearbox Software CorporationReleased in 2013 (EU: February 2013) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Spoilers ahead. Aliens: Colonial Marines is a direct sequel to James Cameron film Aliens (1986) and takes you back to LV-426 where the Colonial Marines in Aliens were sent. You take the roll of a Marine, Corporal Christopher Winter, and you will discover what happened on the marine ship USS Sulaco and on the surface of LV-426. LV-426, 'fool moon of Acheron', the planetoid of Alien (1979) where the crew of the USS Nostromo discovered the remnants of a derelict spaceship and a fossilized crewpilot called the 'Space Jockey'. You will discover that 'The Company' ('Wey-Yu' or 'Weyland Yutani'), already mentioned in the film 'Alien' (1979), play a big role in the game. The game received a lot of bad reviews. Mainly because of its story, dated graphics and bugs and glitches. Many bad reviews were based on the view that the game didn't create 'the feeling' of being in the Alien Universe. This review will focus on four different parts: story and gameplay, graphics, sound and replayability. The conclusion will give a short summary. (tip: before you play this game, you should have seen the Alien films and/or played other Alien related games)StoryThe story of Aliens: Colonial Marines takes place after the film Aliens (1986) and before Alien 3 (1992). You are Winter, a Colonial Marine. ‘OOORAH!’ You receive orders from Captain Cruz: find out what happened on the USS Sulaco. A few weeks ago, contact with the Marines on LV-426 was lost. They were sent on the USS Sulaco. Together with a female, Leutenant Ripley, they were sent to investigate the colony 'Hadleys Hope' on LV-426. Build by Weyland-Yutani/Wey-Yu. Things go terribly wrong.The game starts with a message from Corporal Hicks, a Colonial Marine who survived the Alien attack on LV-426. Only a female called Ripley, a kid named 'Newt' and a synthetic named 'Bishop' survived. The rest of the Marines are K.I.A. Together with a private called 'O-Neal', you discover that the Company/Wey-Yu has its ties in many sectors. In the game you make use of many iconic weapons: Pulse Rifle, Smartgun etc. All from the Alien franchise. The game is a FPS ('First Person Shooter') in the Alien Universe. Due to its connection with the Alien franchise, you recognize many locations (and some characters) from the film Aliens. In the game private Peter O-Neal and (later) private Bella work with you together. The singleplayer campaign is about six to eight hours long: it depends on the difficulty. Unlike most other FPS titles, you can play with up to four players in singleplayer. This is a cool feature. Both singleplayer and multiplayer can be played with friends. In the campaign, you can unlock challenges to unlock cool skins and other features for your (online) characters. Artifical Intelligence The A.I. of the game is not that good. Enemies will sometimes stop in front of you or dont move at all. Your company Marines will not always fire on enemy targets. The best thing you can do is fully concentrate on your own character: dont depend on the firepower from your team. Enemies will rush and try to flank you. The complain that the enemy A.I. is 'bad' is just a lie: the difficulty of the game is responsible for the enemy A.I. Try the game on the highest difficulty setting (UB) and you will be surprised. The story of the game is good, its canon and fits into the Alien Universe. You can play the downloadable content to understand the whole story. MultiplayerIf you play multiplayer, you can play a lot of modes. This gives it a high level of (re)playability. The unique feature is to play as the Alien creatures. Rare aliens like the 'Boiler' and the 'Crusher' can be 'unlocked' to play on the different maps. In the different multiplayer modes, you can try and unlock different skins for your alien and for your marine character. In-game bugs and screen tearing in singleplayer and multiplayer.Yes, this is present in the game. Many reviews complained about the bugs and the screen tearing. Its a minus, but not a very big one. GraphicsMany reviewers said the graphics are 'crap' or at least 'very bad'. Indeed, they are not as good as 'Crysis 3' or other high-end PC games. Compared to 'AVP' from 2010, they are different, perhaps not as good on maximum, but 'good enough', 'unique' in my opinion. But why play 'Aliens' games to enjoy high end graphics? Its a game (and a movie) about a dark setting, with a focus on atmosphere and raw action. Not all gamers are born in 2013: they didnt know about high end graphics on their SNES but enjoyed and loved games how they are. Remember 'Aliens' came out in 1986. This is the second film, not the first one. This game represents that 1986 setting. When you come across LV-426 and the Derelict Spacecraft, you see the graphics are not that bad. They are just different with a unique touch. Its raining on LV-426 all the day and you see the water on your screen, the light effects are very nicely done in this game. You look up into the sky on LV-426 and you see vulcanic activity and smoke. The character models look not that good, but good enough. Better then average. Yes, you can go right through them, but is that 'crap'? The only thing that is a minus are the facial expressions: they are 'robotic' with no emotions at all. The Xenomorphs look good. They crawl and jump right toward your screen and bleed green acid. They have a 'better then average' level of detail. The enviroments look very good, from Hadleys Hope to the dark basement of the colony. Weapons look graphically 'good enough' and represent the different weapons in the movie franchise. SoundThe sound of this game is very good: its straight from the films. The sound of a firing Pulse Rifle, Smartgun, or Pump Shotgun represent the sound of the weapons in the movie franchise. The sound of the characters is good. The voice of Lance Henriksen is present in the game and other actors from the film 'Aliens' were responsible for the in-game voice sounds. The sound in environments is good. It gives you a sense of a dark place far from the earth. Desolated and abandoned. The sound in the colony is realistic: it gives the game a ‘dark feeling’. The Alien creatures scream just like in the movie. ReplayabilityReplayability of the game is high because of the many offline and online options. You can customize your weapons, create your own marine and create your online Alien creature. The game has many online modes to offer: TD, Escape, Survival, etc. Other downloadable content is available. ConclusionAliens: Colonial Marines is a game that is loyal to the Alien franchise. A FPS title, related to the film 'Aliens' from 1986 with 'action-horror' elements. Due to the multiplayer online feature, the chance to play the Alien creatures and the co-op feature in singleplayer, this game is fresh and innovative. Its just different then the most FPS titles like Call of Duty or Battlefield. If you are a FPS player with no interest in the Alien franchise, this game is 'average' to 'good' (6/10 or 7/10). If you like the Alien franchise, or played a lot of 'Alien related games', you know this game is not a bad game. If you are a big fan, just like me, you will love this game. If you haven't seen the Alien movies, go watch them first. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The good* Sound;* Atmosphere;* Co - op. Campaign can be played with friends. * Multiplayer modes.* Canon story. The bad* A.I. is not always consistent;* Some screen tearing and in-game bugs. VERDICT: 7 out of 10			"

												What the ♥♥♥♥ is this game ?I mean, ok, there is pathfinding issues in every games.But here, we are talking about SUPERMAN-LIKE ALIENS. Yeah, they jump like 100m around the map, with ♥♥♥♥ing messy behaviours. You don't really know when they flee or fight, it's like shooting a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bunch of down-syndrom aliens doing random stuff.At first, you could say that it's a big issue. But the game is so ♥♥♥♥ing boring that you start to like this. You will skip every cinematic and wait to see what's comming up next.Running on the walls ? Well it's too mainstream, these retardaliens will ♥♥♥♥ing run in them, in order to confuse yourself in your strategy, jumping on you at last time.Dodging bullets? Yeah they do it without even realise where they are.And it gets worse at every chapter. And wait the robot-fights. It could be epic if three aliens warriors weren't ♥♥♥♥ing a rock while you fight. 5/7 play it drunk with friends			"

												This game is an absolute disgrace to everything Alien. Borderlands style gameplay with the alien franchise does not work. The fact that you seem to fight more humans than you do aliens and that you die so easily even on easy mode has made me give up on attempting to play this clunky mess. I wouldn't wish this game on my worst enemy let alone a friend.It isn't terrible on co op, however the ending and about everything else in this game makes me cringe.A shooting gallery is a dlc. Really Gearbox?It also is noncannon.  Watch Alien 3 and find out why Hicks couldn't be in colonial marines.  "

												I don't get the hate for this game, the maps, the story, the mecahnics, everything about it is awesome. The survival mode is great and just what you would expect from a ""zombies"" with Xenos. Multiplayer could be better but it could be worse. I know it had issues on its release, but it is perfectly stable now, works great on PC and is definitely worth the play through, the DLC with Hicks is awesome as well! Overall the game makes a great replacement for ALien 3 and is definitely worth the time.			"

												Strangely enough, I kinda liked this game. It has so bad of a reputation, I thought I'm not going to list the pros and cons of the game in the usual way. Instead I'll try to write down the factors that mattered to me and - although by no means do I think this game is great, still - made it enjoyable. If you are similar to me in these regards, you might like the game too.I like the Aliens settings. In the movie I really liked the atmosphere, the gadgets (weapons, vehicles, the power loader etc.), the planet, the colony buildings, the Alien Queen and I could go on. Most of those things appear in the game. Some better (like the weapons), some worse (the power loader action scene was really bad and the Alien Queen bossfight was unrealistic, annoying and uninteresting) and some mediocre which I still think deliver an acceptable experience (like the planet itself, the colony building).There are some treats like the Derelict with the Space Jockey, which work really well in the game, as well as some lore about the Aliens, which although not much, still quite significant and I like when something new information emerges because it makes me feel there's progress in the whole story.I don't like it when the horror elements are dominant. (In movies or games alike.) I despise jumpscares, (I don't get freaked out easily, I just really feel that they are so cheap of an instrument), but I also don't like the experience of utter solitary helplessness either. I really like the concept of the game - you are in a horror environment, but you are almost never alone. You have AI buddies who help you a feel a little bit safer and braver and makes it easier to carry on. There is a part in the game where you are alone without any weapons - most Alien(s) fans like it the most. Well, for me, it was - although kind of interesting - too horror-heavy.The creators did try to put the story into the canon timeline. And I think it works. They wanted to come up with something that ultimately makes you visit places like the Sulaco, Hadley's Hope, the Derelict ship etc. and maybe not perfect or brilliant or unique, I think at the end of the day it's acceptable.The game has significant weaknesses too, likeGraphics is mediocre at best. As for me, graphic itself is not that important if the game is capable to deliver the appropriate atmosphere. But after the E3 demo, it felt a huge letdown.There are indeed too many missions where you fight against humans. Like, half of the time, you do that. Disappointing and most of the time, boring as well. Not to mention the game mechanic doesn't really shine here. As a vs human shooter, this game is really lacking.You can feel really disappointed at times. Like the famous Alien assault in Hadley's Hope with the sentry gun. Or the Power Loader fight. Those should have been some of the most memorably and best parts of the game. Failed really bad.The characters are neither memorable, nor likeable at all. You barely get to know them and in the end, you hardly care what is going to happen to them.And there are things that are up to debate in my opinion.Lack of smartgun play. There are time when you get to use this beaty, but those are few and far between. Yet, I can't help but feel this is due to the fact that it's was too powerful. It's an autotracking high-volume high-caliber machine gun. You just aim in the general direction of the enemy, pull the trigger and just see hordes of them splatter in every direction within seconds.The story is kinda generic, but I think it's not out of place at all. I felt it is believable.Overall in my opinion it's a slightly above average game with the redeeming factors making it worthy to experience it once. "

												I liked this game. Really liked it very much. Solo playthrough on the hardest difficulty was interesting and immersive, found a lot of things from the original movie. However multiplayer experience was not so good as multiplayer is dead. Still I give thumbs up fo 30+ hours in singleplayer, it was worth the money. Would still be playing multi if there was at least somebody but me.			"

												Strangely enough, I kinda liked this game. It has so bad of a reputation, I thought I'm not going to list the pros and cons of the game in the usual way. Instead I'll try to write down the factors that mattered to me and - although by no means do I think this game is great, still - made it enjoyable. If you are similar to me in these regards, you might like the game too.I like the Aliens settings. In the movie I really liked the atmosphere, the gadgets (weapons, vehicles, the power loader etc.), the planet, the colony buildings, the Alien Queen and I could go on. Most of those things appear in the game. Some better (like the weapons), some worse (the power loader action scene was really bad and the Alien Queen bossfight was unrealistic, annoying and uninteresting) and some mediocre which I still think deliver an acceptable experience (like the planet itself, the colony building).There are some treats like the Derelict with the Space Jockey, which work really well in the game, as well as some lore about the Aliens, which although not much, still quite significant and I like when something new information emerges because it makes me feel there's progress in the whole story.I don't like it when the horror elements are dominant. (In movies or games alike.) I despise jumpscares, (I don't get freaked out easily, I just really feel that they are so cheap of an instrument), but I also don't like the experience of utter solitary helplessness either.

												I bought this game with my expectations very low as I was aware of the quality of this game before I purchased it. With that said, this game wasn't as bad as reviews would make you originally think, but it is definitely medicore - no doubt about it. Positives:-Sound effects are great, such as the pulse rifle.-Lighting effects and positions in the levels can create a moody atmosphere.-Alien models look good.-Movie locations recreated in-game look faithful.-Characters are okay, not great... but okay. Bella is annoying though. Gearbox tried to make O'Neal the player's companion but unfortunately they didn't give him enough dialogue to make him memorable. -Legendary weapons are a cool idea, and the game does have a few collectibles if that is your thing.-Some of the levels are fun and unique, such as the sewer level. Negatives:-The player fights more human enemies than aliens, which is stupid as hell.-AI is terrible! Aliens will take forever to react to you and even then they just mindlessly charge towards you without even taking alternate routes (such as walls or roofs). Sometimes aliens will just stand still while you blow their acidic brains out. -The gunplay is so boringly mediocore in this game, you literally just spray your weapons at enemies hiding behind cover hoping some of your bullets randomly hit. -Game is way too easy even on the hardest difficulty.-Level design is way too linear, you pretty much run at a straight line hip firing towards cardboard humans with no intelligence and repeat every level.-Fighting the big alien with the exosuit is a terrible experience. The aliens will run under your exosuit which causes the player to spin around at random that will kill you, over... and over... and over again. -Last boss fight is incredibly easy and is a bit of a joke.-Voice acting for the aliens character is laughable.-So many plot holes.-Team mates are completely useless, they shoot peas instead of bullets. They don't help at all. Overall, this game is incredibly mediocore. I would avoid playing this game unless you're a huge alien fan. Pretty much every other game featuring an xenomorph is better than this. I recommend Aliens vs Predator 1 and 2, Alien Trilogy, Aliens vs Predator Extinction and Alien Isolation. The gameplay is boring, the characters are boring for the most part and the story has more holes than O'Neal's brain. 4/10			"

												This is a FPS game.(+) The Good:If and only IF you are a fan of the Movie Aliens like I’m, then this game will mean a lot to you, as they have captured real sounds and voice acting from the movie. Example, the Machine gun sounds strange if you did not see the movie. However, if you have seen the movie the sound would bring a smile to your face. Similar to the Alien sounds and eggs opening sounds and most of all the Radar beeping sound… other than that there is no positive points unfortunately…(-) The Bad:Unfortunately, the game has a LOT of issues, They simply focused on capturing the real sounds and totally neglected the fun factor! For example, you would think a game that got released in 2013 would have stunning graphics, well no it has maybe 2003/2004 graphics, the AI is as smart as a 3 year old, well maybe that’s an insult to 3 year olds, In the Campaign mode the game is missing a TON of the fun factor, and in the Co-Op Mode it is laggy and has a lot of issues this is at 50 Ping. The game feels boring after a while, you simply get that bad feeling that you just want to quit the game and go play ANYTHING else maybe solitaire even. Considering that this game is kind of like the Sequel to “Aliens Vs Predators” it does not match at all! They have simply taken a very fun and great game and smashed it into pieces…(*) The Ugly:Huge disappointment. Rating ( 4.5 / 10.00 )			"

												This game is an absolute disgrace to everything Alien. Borderlands style gameplay with the alien franchise does not work. The fact that you seem to fight more humans than you do aliens and that you die so easily even on easy mode has made me give up on attempting to play this clunky mess. I wouldn't wish this game on my worst enemy let alone a friend.It isn't terrible on co op, however the ending and about everything else in this game makes me cringe.A shooting gallery is a dlc. Really Gearbox?It also is noncannon.  Watch Alien 3 and find out why Hicks couldn't be in colonial marines.  "

												Первоначальная ""сырая"" версия Aliens.Colonial Marines получила множество негативных отзывов (во многом заслуженных) и стала примером того, как не надо делать игры во вселенной ""Чужих"". Но сейчас, после нескольких объемных патчей, большая часть недостатков исправлена. Проходить кампанию рекомендуется на уровне сложности ""супергерой"", только в этом случае игра раскрывает свой потенциал и больше соответствует духу фильма ""Чужие 2"".			"

												The first time I played this game was on a base in Afghanistan. A few friends and I rushed out to buy it for the console that we brought with us and when we got it started we absolutely hated it. The amount of bugs and other problems (including crashing the console!) ruined the experience and we couldn't enjoy it. We went back to CoD:BLOPS2 and never looked back.I bought the game two years or so ago on PC thinking that it had been fixed up by Gearbox - it hadn't. Only recently has a third-party modder (TemplarGFX on ModDB) taken a crack at it and now, finally, the game is getting to where it should have been from the get go.Here's the link:http://www.moddb.com/mods/templargfxs-acm-overhaul/downloadsWith the mod installed and the 'faster, weaker Soldiers' enabled the game finally feels like a proper Aliens experience. Partner AI has been dramatically improved, the enemy attacks are smarter, and the weapons actually feel like they have variety and character. There are still flaws (the cheesy dialogue, the plot with holes the size of a freighter, and areas where you can smell the missing content that was cut in the rushed production), but the game is much, much better. Buy it at a discount, install TemplarGFX's mod, and enjoy the experience.			"

												I got this game when it was on sale for cheap a while back and finally decided to install it and play it now that I had some free time. I figured a few years since the grand thud that it made when it dropped should be enough time for things to be ironed out and the game playable.I was right and wrong.The straight game, on its own, is still bad. Graphics certainly look better, but nothing extraordinary. The voice acting is weak for the most part, with Michael Biehn totally phoning it in and almost sounding like he'd rather be doing anything else but this. He's better in Stasis Interrupted but not up to the level he should be. Lance Henriksen on the other hand is a consumate professional and turns in a good preformance as Bishop and Wayland.I didn't find the story as bad as a lot of people make it out to be, it's a very straight forward thing in most respects and they do a decent job of having enough mystery and question to have you going from place to place. There is still a bunch of dumb and contrivance throughout, though. You will need the Stasis Interrupted DLC to have a plausable explination why Hicks shows up towards the end. It still has the most horrible, underwhelming boss battle of almost any game -- no idea who allowed that through for a run-n-gun shooter, but they should be tossed out an airlock.As to the Stasis Interrupted DLC, I felt it was a decent expansion of the events that happen before the game proper take place. It's told in 3 chapters. The first tells the story of a woman named Lisbeth and has a very proto-Alien:Isolation feel to a lot of it. The second tells of a man named Stone who rescues Hicks and their attempted escape to Fiorina 161 and the third is Dr. Levi and Hicks running through the under construction lab facilities trying to get the word out about what's going on on LV426. (This is why you don't smack-talk your employees in front of them, Wayland). It makes Hicks' reveal towards the end of the main game less WTF and wasn't as horrible an explination as might have been. Totally worth a playthough.Since the online multiplayer is dead, unless you have friends to play all the extra maps with, are a completionist, or really like all the shiny weapons, there is no reason to get any of the other DLC packs.Now, what you will need, if you want to play this game and have it be the best experience it can be, is TemplarGFX's ACM Overhaul mod. I read about it first here and it was the reason I decided to actually play this game because it makes it, well, playable. It may also aid in stability, as I didn't have the game crash once on me in over 16hrs of playing.The graphical overhaul is a really nice feature, making it look much better than stock, but where it really shines are all the gameplay and AI enhancements. The Xenos become... well, terrifying. They will run up walls, along ceilings, retreat when fired on or wounded, sneak along, or just drop on top of you and slash you to pieces. They become fast, deadly, and will just wreck your♥♥♥♥♥♥ You will die in this game. Like, a lot. The soldiers become decent opponents, flanking and hiding from you, and not the hive-minded bullet-sponges they were on release. Best of all your team-mates become useful! Not perfect by any means, but not the absolutely useless♥♥♥♥♥♥they were before. They no longer get stuck in your way, blocking your progress, and will actually shoot enemies... most of the time.Oh, and big selling point: you now get the Smart Gun 5 times throughout the campaign instead of just twice and are able to make very satisifying use of it each time.If you own the game and haven't tried it since release, I'd say give it a go with the Overhaul pack. If you can get the game on sale for cheap and have been curious, same as well. The story still weak, the ending terrible, but the rest of it becomes a much, much more solid game more in line with what was promised of it on launch.			"

												There are a lot of bad reviews of this game stating how it was a bug addled mess on release and how it failed to deliver all that the developers had promised. I am playing it three years later and it must of been patched as I have had no problems with it. The graphics seem fine if nothing amazing and I have no idea what was initially promised so I am rating this game purely on what it is, not on what was ecpected.If you are a fan of the films there are plenty of references and the tone and style of the story fit with the second film, the aftermath of which is delt with in the storyline here. It has been far too long since I played AVP 2 (have not played Isolation) to compare them fairly but this is probably not as good as that was although the graphics are a lot better (if prehaps not as imprived as they should be given the years between their development). A:CM is however far better than the original AVP. It can be difficult to hit anything at first but as with Dead Space you will become proficient at slaughtering monsters once you get used to how your character moves and responds to the controls.If I have a complaint it is the placement of some of the save checkpoints. At some points of the game you will reach several checkpoints within a couple minutes without any real challanging areas between them. Then at others, most notably towards the end of the first level, you will have to go through quite a bit of intense fighting before hitting the next checkpoint leading to a lot of replaying the same section. This put me off playing for several months but once past it it was not that dificult to beat again. I found the game, story and dialogue to be very enjoyable.Overall this is not a ground breaking or visually stunning masterpiece but if you like the films do not let all the negative reviews put you off, many of the complaints are either irrelevent to the actual gameplay or have been resolved since release. It is definitly worth getting next time it is 75% off, would not pay full price.			"

I've watched all the aliens movies, read several of the novels and played a few of the other alien games out there and i found that it stays true to storyline, the atmosphere of the movies (except promethious) and the gameplay of the FPS. Personally, I played this game with no pre-conceptions and enjoyed myself immensly.			"

												A game that deserves a lot more than it got. I absolutely loved the game and everything about. I pre-ordered the game, the only game I have pre-ordered or even spent more than $20 on steam and it was absolutely worth it! If you enjoy the Alien franchise and fun first person shooters this is the game for you.True the game is flawed and not perfect, and the multiplayer match finder is incredibly bad. However there is no greater thrill being one of four colonial marines with your friends in an abandoned starship watching your motion sensor beep at the oncoming aliens. Setting up sentry turrents, running out of ammo, losing squadmates along the way, welding doors. It's all a blast!My particularily favorite game modes are Escape, Survival and Bug Hunt. However due to the smaller player base now and the terrible match finder the first two game modes mentioned (escape survival) are almost impossible to set up.I do believe this game was rushed and I also do believe it could have been significantly better; however when I look at my steam library there are far and few games that jump out and scream play me on LAN night. Aliens Colonial Marines is an exceptional gem in the Aliens Universe and perfect for any avid fan.			"

												To be fair they did make big improvements with updates and DLC and to date it’s the best alien game for multiplayer experience. One thing this game did right was the weapons. They all have a distinct dynamic and their customizable to your preferences. The weapons gameplay reminds me allot of Pay Day 2 it’s a step in the right direction, unlike COD with every gun feeling generic "

												I'm treading lightly here, for a number of obvious reasons and I'm probably going to get lynched for this review.Apparently this game was a mess on release. I never really had the misfortune of playing the unmodded, unpatched version. If you do happen to purchase or play this game, three things you absolutely must do. ...1 - Buy the game when it goes on sale, even with all the fixes it's still probably sub-par with what is acceptable. 2 - Download the Templar GFX ACM overhaul mod and modify the .ini files (Google it), it will turn the game into something a little more what it should have been.2 - Having followed the previous step, play the game with an open mind, play it for it's single player campaign and try not to jump on the herd mentality bandwagon, I'll explain why in a moment. There are a number of things you'll get out of this game if you're only playing single player. It holds true to the atmosphere in a big way, one thing they got right was those moments you look around and appreciate what they've created. Going to places in the Aliens movies (even though they shouldn't really exist anymore...) brings back those nostalgic feelings of watching Aliens for the first time. There are a few scripted moments which were done well also. Some people might find the graphics a little dated or rubbish but I had no problems, I mean heck, with my 200+ backlog of games on steam I'm still playing games from early 2000....So ACM was a real treat graphically for me. Soundwise....well who does'nt like the sound of a pulse rifle or shotgun? The sounds are beefy and pack some punch. I lost interest in the story or only vaguely followed it because I knew there were a ton of obvious inconsistent moments with the Alien franchise. It didn't help that I was thinking ""oh here we go again, I've heard these lines in other games before"". To be honest, the voice acting was ok but the dialogue was....cheesy and cliche. I was not impressed by the constant frame dips, despite my PC being well above spec, I'm not the only person with this issue though, you really need to tweak a lot to get this game running and looking nice.My personal opinion is that yes, I'd recommend this game but only when the above suggestions are followed. I did actually enjoy it.  "

												I was a silly person and put money down on for pre-release... Fortunately, for me this game didn't crash or play poorly, but for others no end of issues. After all the reviews came out, I had my 'rose tinted glasses', lifted and saw behind the facade. The AI, was glitchy and dumb, the lighting and graphics did not match the early demos, and I stopped playing after speeding through the game once, as I did not need to put myself through it again..Fast forward to 2016, if you search around the web you'll come across a Mod for A-CM that improves the game considerably. AI, graphics, and if I was Sega/Gearbox, or who ever takes responsibilty  for this game , hire this guy/gal..This game is nice and playable with the Mod, and without it.. kinda like pushing runny poo up a hill with your fingertips... Messy, and pointless :) "

Large world, Long play before loading new map. The sound effect is greats, classic from the movie. Team work is required but not much as L4D. Nice first person animation. Weapons to use is quite enough (As a Marine). We quite disapointed at first look on some weapons. Recommended you to find all legendary weapons, You will love the dev a little bit more (Straight from the movie). The AI is smart enough to kill us all 4 of us. (Ultimate Badass Difficulty). They can dodge, jump away, leaping toward you, surpirse you from behind and  more. We encounter no bug at all except friendly NPC stuck near elevator for about 30 second but only once. AI can lose thier limb too. Story line is fun and can be scary. Turret can be deploy in realistic way. And can you control the classic yellow loader robot like ribly does? Find out your self.This game worth 9 bux for us. 7/10   (still hoping for AVP3)We think Gearbox might run out of budget or some sort. This game can go even further.Well, if you like shooting alien with friend, support the dev and play it with your friend now.			"

												Never bought this game until I saw it for ~£2-3 a few weeks ago as i knew it was supposed to have gotten the worst reviews ever.However i'm probably half way through the game just now and I honestly dont know where all the harsh negativity comes from, yes the aliens dont have the best ai ever and the story is a little drole (the locations are nice though) but that aside its a competant shooter. The sound is perfect, from the blasts of the pulse rifles to the groans of dilapidated doors trying to open, the graphics are not bad for 360/ps3 era gen and are very much the same as alien vs predator (sega not rebellion) although the gun models are much better here.All in all its not perfect but really does not deserve all the negativity... oh and being negative about a game because it has dlc is lame, its a thing and its here to stay, it dosnt mean you have to buy it to enjoy the game, most dlc i know of is mostly useless anyway and dosnt add much to the game, its just a crass money making scheme, either buy it or ignore it... like i mostly do :P			"

I mean, the enemies still charge at you while others just sit around doing nothing about 30 metres away but it's actually an enjoyable experience if you overlook the rather shallow story and the superficial AI competencies. If this game is on sale for under 5 dollars and you love blowing Aliens to bits, I strongly recommend this game to you.			"

												This game is actually quite good!. Got it in a sale and between this and Aliens Vs Predator this one is a lot more fun to play.  Yes it has a few bugs still and some parts of the game are a bit dopey (O'neals face) but overall so far its been fun playing through with my brother. Now i've not played Alien Isolation yet but have seen a lot and I would say out of the current three Aliens games this is easily the least scary... in single player that is. IN a 1 vs 1 multiplayer where you play as a marine and your opponent is the ALien you can have a whole heap of jump scare fun!I would definitely recommend it to fans and non fans a like, its just an all round fun game.

												Well, i took the plunge and bought this game..more for a laugh really. Turned out much better than i thought. Not perfect though. Baring in mind This is after the big patch and only single player campaign. (plus got it for £2) I thought it was entertaining enough...plenty to keep you occupied. Visiting the old Movie sites like Hadleys hope, Sulaca and many more. Lots of weapons to use and upgrade. The story is so so, not that i really cared. Its all been done before but was playing this as a huge Aliens fan. To me the game DOES make you feel like your in the Aliens universe. Amazing sounds from weapons and aliens. The motion tracker is awesome but just having it on and listening ..you'll think your watching Aliens....although a pain when you have to switch back to gun before being eaten.  All in All i would recommend this game...even for those who arent major Aliens fans the games worth the steam price (even though i didnt pay it) and id go as far as saying better than a lot of other FPS games at the same price.

												A lot of the complaints I have heard about Aliens: Colonial Marines were justified on release. Since then most of the issues that I am aware of have been patched. The Alien AI is better and very lethal. They like to run on the ceiling when you are destracted by their buddies and drop down behind you. I have died many times to this before I adapted. There are a few remaining issues but those are mainly minor irritants. The AI will still get stuck and get left behind at times, but when you reach the objective or checkpoint they teliport to you and carry on as normal. The price right now is $2.99 (80% off steam sale) and during this time it is more then worth the price. If you do decide to pick up the game I highly recommend buying Stasis Interupted. The DLC adds several more missions and gives explanation to what happened aboard the Suloco after it left LV-426 at the end of Aliens.			"

												I picked up this game on a steam sale for about 5 dollars.  The game wasnt perfect, but I had fun playing it.  The graphics were OK for the money and the sound effects for the atmosphere as well as the guns were just about perfect.  I know a lot of people give this game terrible reviews, but I thought it was a pretty good game for the money.  I have definately played much worse games.  If you can pick up this game for 10 dollars or less, I would recommend it.			"

												Just a quick review.  I bought this for $5.  I've only played the single player mission up to mission 4.  It's really not that bad.  In fact, its quite a lot of fun.  For $5 its great.  It gets the adrenaline pumping, and is a lot of fun.  I think I would criticize the fact that there are so many cliches and locations from the film, but if you have a sense of humour you might find it vaguely amusing.  The aliens themselves are too weak, the AI isn't amazing, but they come thick and fast.  It's not an original game and its not as good as the original avp from 2000, but it is a lot of harmless fun.  Perhaps the game was released buggy, and of course its not up there in quality with the original alien franchise.  But I don't understand the haters.  I have played far far worse games in my life.  My score would be 3/5.  Fun but average.			"

												If you are into the Aliens franchise, you will like this game. The multiplayer for me is not working but could work for others. Is a fun game if you played it all ready but if you haven't you will die a lot. The aliens instantly kill you if they grab you on your last health segment and the armor meter goes down pretty fast. On a plus side, there is ammo just about everywhere in a combat situtation (A good tip is to not use your grenades all at once. You only get them from hostile marines). Still a fun game for shooting things if that's your style.			"

												I am a fan of the Aliens series and found this game as-is is not a bad game at all.  However, the story is severely lacking in development.  The AI is meh to say the least, and the Reward Systems leave MUCH to be desired.  It really would have been nice if the publisher had updated the Rewards system upon releasing additional content for the game.  The reason being, it would make tracking progress much easier.  The DLC Bug Hunt and Stasis Interupted pretty much MAKE this game.  As much as I would enjoy seeing more content for this game, I'm afraid that is unlikely at this point.My suggestion would be to wait for a Steam Sale to purchase this game and any of the DLC.			"

												I really can't understand the hate for this game that most have. Granted, I didn't buy it until well after the various, weighty patches were put in to play...but now that they are, I'm just not seeing a whole lot of reason for any hate. The graphics are awesome, especially with that ""film grain"" option turned on, the gameplay is solid(standard FPS fare) and though the story wasn't what most were hoping for, it's still an entertaining tale. The game has its issues, like every other game ever made does, but they're just not enough to bring down the overall experience, which I would say is a very enjoyable one.			"

Particularly if you are a Huge Alien fan like I am. I have enjoyed playing the game, it's just not what it was meant to be.Don't spend lots of money on this game, pick it up on sale, and when you have nothing to play on a rainy Saturday, dust this one off of the pile of Shame and spend a few hours with a pulse rifle taking down Aliens.

												Great game (after patching - apparently it's full of bugs before that, and not just the acid-for-blood type).Really feels like the Aliens movie and has an excellent story that fits into the movie stories perfectly. I found the graphics outstanding, especially in their authenticity of the Aliens locations, armour, weapons, tech, etc. Action is terrific and the creatures' motion and attacks are, again, dead-on for the movie.Working my way through the DLC now, which is very worthwhile and long compared to the DLC's of other games (I estimate I've played for over 6 hours so far, though I do like to explore everywhere and see everything... and I get killed fairly regularly).Sad that the original release of a very unpolished version of the game made A:CM a flop. There's obviously a lot of work and love gone into the game, all presumably ruined because some jerk somewhere decided to release the game too early.			"

												Honestly I don't think this game deserves half the hate it gets. It's no masterpiece, but it has it's merits. Some of the levels are just fun, particularly 'The Raven' which had a good pacing for the suspence and was entirely focused on xenomorphs instead of the wey-yu. Gameplay is about what you'd expect out of a shooter, though I wouldn't be putting to much stock into your AI companions, to put it frankly they can't shoot worth a damn and when they do manage to hit something it's probably not the target you're wanting them to hit.The story is meh. Honestly they could have gone in other directions with it, and seeing as the DLC page spoils it for you anyhow  the fact that it's Hicks and not one of the other marines that may have not actually died on the planet makes me roll my eyes. That being said if you are looking for some mindless xeno blasting then the game will certainly feed that need. I'd recomend playing with friends at hardened or ultimate badass otherwise the enemy AI is only marginally better then your companions.I'll be honest I've not tried to much of the online component, but there aren't to many people playing so you're not likely to find a team unless you have friends.

Posted: February 9, 2014
												I'm a big fan of Aliens-themed videogames. Two of my all time favorites were created by Rebellion software, Aliens vs. Predator on the Atari Jaguar and the first PC release of the same title. Both of those games are at the top of my Aliens list and over the years since then there have been quite a few Aliens games that failed to deliver the same level of atmosphere and excitement. The majority have been flops in my opinion. So I was skeptical when I heard about Aliens Colonial Marines. I found out about ACM shortly before it's release so I was unaware of it's long development cycle. I did not see early dev screenshots or short videos of in-game play which allowed me to keep an open mind about it.The storyline of ACM takes place almost immediately after the end of the film Aliens and it returns the player to a plotline focused around events on LV426. To me, this was pretty much a re-run on a plot since the first Aliens vs. Predator PC title also returned the player to LV426. The difference between the two however is AVP had a more interesting story that made sense and presented a much more plausible mystery. ACM's plot is heavily scripted with a large amount of character dialogue and cutscenes that aimed to make it more of a film experience than a game which becomes a little tiresome after a while. Thankfully your trusty escape key can bypass that noise and get you back into the action.ACM is restrictive as you progress through each area. You cannot explore much or find your own way, everything is blocked off which forces players through as if they are on a train track. I would have liked many sections of the game a lot more if players had the ability to take multiple routes or blunder your way to the next objective. Instead it feels more like an arcade light gun game where you are corralled into the next tough spot and have to blast your way out. It's tolerable and at times pretty fun but it could have been better. Graphically ACM got many bad reviews. I think this is partly due to people who were following the development of the game over a long period of time and were expecting something else than the finished product. Also, some players complained that the quality of the graphics looked like something out of the mid 1990's. That simply isn't the case. ACM looks awesome and really captured the look and feel of Aliens from the film. The Aliens themselves look very realistic. It is spot on and has some great effects. I have to conclude that people who think ACM's graphics are lacking and compare it to a 90's videogame probably weren't around back then and were born with a silver Pentium in their mouth.Overall I enjoyed the single player campaign despite the gameplay shortcomings and less than inventive story. Replayability was better than average due to being able to play through all the single player missions on co-op with friends as well as being able to increase the difficulty level to it's hardest setting. Ultimate Badass difficulty makes ACM more of an entertaining challenge to play. Once all that is finished though players will find themselves stuck with very poorly executed multiplayer choices and a majority of DLC content that is fairly dull. Of the DLC, Bug Hunt and Stasis Interrupted are the only two items to definitely get. The rest I would completely avoid. Here's why. The multiplayer server setup is completely broken. If you are looking to play Team Deathmatch, Survivor, or some of the other options available more than likely you'll be stuck waiting for 20 minutes without finding any players. Generally the system can't find anybody and will simply time out. You are better off 'friending' other players in the ACM community and linking up with them if you want to try to play those game modes.Bug Hunt offers the best multiplay option. It's a ton of fun and you will have to work together in a four person team in order to survive. Each of the three maps are well laid out with strategically placed drops of equipment and supplies. The catch to this is- you have to earn the ability to access them through kills. The more enemies you kill, the more loot you get. More loot means you can buy your way into a locked building or open up a crate full of ammo. Players will also fare better if they choose to pool their resources and cash together which is a nice touch. If you happen to have loads of space bucks you can gift some of it to a less fortunate Marine which will allow them to buy back in after being killed, or buy them a smart gun and toss it their way. Stasis Interrupted is the other worthy DLC. It is another single player campaign with the choice of also playing co-op. This add on builds the ACM story from a prequel timeline and explains more of the overall plot. Unlike the main single player campaign this has a bit more of an exploration feel to it and was not as restrictive which is a nice change of pace.Overall I think Aliens Colonial Marines is pretty good. Yeah, it has issues and some things could have been implemented better but I do enjoy this game. If you are a fan of the Alien franchise I say grab your body armor, light up a flamethrower and pick up a copy of ACM. It's bug stompin' time!			"

												Okay so it's not the best game but the patches have solved the problem of skittle the dancing alien.  If you're a fan of the film it's worth picking up at bargain price - I paid £2.99 in GAME for a physical copy and for that I'm happy with what was quite an enjoyable, if clunky, single player campaign.  The weapon sounds from the films are excellent and some of the things your fellow marines say are right on the whole feel of the marines from the films.  Plus using the msart gun feels soooo good.

												First of all I would like to say that I had this game pre-ordered almost a year before it had come out. But since a lot of PC games are hit or miss I decided to wait for the reviews before I picked up my game. After about a week of reading all of the terrible reviews I decided to cancel my pre-order and put it towards something else. As time went on I forgot about the game and that was that. Then the other day here on Steam I found the game on sale for $4.99, I decided to look into it and see if there had been any improvements since last I cared to look. I saw nothing positive really and basically the only reviews or information I could find were from the original release, there was nothing current that I could find. Then while searching, I found a video on youtube dated 2014, I decided to watch it and have this help me make my final decision. After just the first few minutes I thought everything looked really cool and it seemed to play exactly how I had hoped. Upon some more research I found out that they had released a 4gb patch back in august 2013 to address all of the issues, but at this time nobody wanted to bother to re-review it since so much time had passed. I decided for $5 it may be worth checking out. So I purchased a copy for myself and my 2 other friends also got copies for themselves. We got everything installed and waited for the weekend. I must also add that we are huge L4D2 fans and with the almost endless supply of user maps we have logged over 300 hours since it's release. We also play ARMA2 and 3, with at least that many hours if not more into ARMA2, Rainbow 6 and before they messed it up with the last release, Ghost Recon. So we have quite a bit of experience with co-op campaign games and know what we like and what we don't. So finally the day came, we each loaded up the game and I created a LAN Co-op Campaign game and my friends logged in. From the moment the cut scene was over I was pleased with what I saw, despite what the reviews had said I thought the game looked pretty good. I had everything cranked up as high as it would go and I was loving it. When I had to open my motion tracker and heard that familiar sound my heart began to race. Then once I saw my first alien crawling across the ceiling towards my team I knew I was hooked. We could not get enough of this fantastic game and after playing for 9 hours straight only pausing for food, we finished nearly 60% before having to stop and go back to the real world. I don't know if that 4gb patch actually fixed everything that was wrong with the game or if people were just being over critical, but I felt the $5 I spent was well worth it and I still would have been happy had I paid more. I only have a minor issue, but this can be said about a most games after I have gotten used to the modabilty and user maps of L4D2 and ARMA2/3...I wish the game was longer or at the very least had user maps available. Yes I know there is DLC to add on a few more maps, but I could easily see myself and my friends logging 300 hours with this game if there were the maps to support it. If you like L4d2 then trust me, I believe you will also like this. I would like to thank the publishers for what I think is an awesome game and if you had ever been interested in this game or saw the movie and would like to be a part of it then I think  you owe it to yourself to give this a shot and see how well they did.

												Okay you people have obviously seen a few reviews already and have probably been turned away. I'm only saying this once ♥♥♥♥ the reviewers and their biased uneducated ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. This game was made SPECIFICALLY to give you the feel of being in the 1980's sci-fi action film. That's EXACTLY WHAT IT DOES. From the iconic sound of the pulse rifle to the dark enclosed corridors of Hadley's Hope you get it all hell you even get to use the weapons of Hicks, Hudson, and Velasquez to kill as many Xeno's as you wish. If your big on the alien franchise like I am you will enjoy the game for the continuation of the story. The AI is a little clunky and could have used a little more tuning and the facial animations could have been a tad better but that doesn't ruin the fact that a fan of the series gets to experience LV-426 post film.Final Thoughts:You will enjoy the game if your a fan of the series and you know exactly what your getting into if you are unfamiliar with it go watch the movies THEN play the game.Overall 8.5/10 +The Aesthetics were spot on and what to expect from a true to context adaption of Aliens.+The USCM are still the most badass ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in the galaxy+You get a few suprises in the story+4 player co-op=Theres a nice veriety of weapons but there could have been more-Enemy AI's aim is way to spot on and they are a tad dumb-Facial animations are a pretty sketchy-There are some minor clipping issues like Aliens walking through the floor on rare occassion mainly during the last fight   "

												I'm now starting Mission 4 or 5. Apparently this game has been given an overhaul before I bought it and since the time everyone was complaining. Old school difficulty for single player campaign is quite enjoyable. Have yet to try Mutliplayer but I think most online players play Bug Hunt (an extra $20 DLC). I paid $25 (USD) for Ltd. Editiion and feel it is well worth the money so far.			"

												   To be fair, I am a RABID Aliens fan. My review will be slanted from the start. I collect books, movies, replicas and movie props from this film - though I love the whole series/universe, Aliens is by far the superior film. Is it a FANTASTIC game ? No, it isn't. Is it even a good game ? Not terribly. It isn't however; a awful as most of the reviews say.  You are a USCM Marine, you get to use every single iconic weapon in the movie. Though a MAJOR complaint for me was the HORRIBLE INACCURACY of nearly every weapon except the pump shotgun, the Service 9mm and of course the M56 Smartgun. (Hard to miss with IR tracking) The graphics are above average especially since the upgrade patch, and the game IS very atmospheric. Hadley's Hope and The Sulaco are recognizible right down to the name plates on the lockers. Lighting is low and creepy, never knowing where a xeno may pop up.   Bringing me to the story, THIS is why people I think are so upset. Many of the games flaws would have been forgiven... (Poor AI, Unfinished textures and serious issues with the NPC's) It feels thin, unimaginative and the ending is extremely ABRUPT and unsatisfying ! Many will be... WTF just happened ? Hick's inclusion while welcome to me I loved the character, but how they did it is just plain RIDICULOUS. They should have collaborated with Jim Cameron since this is considered cannon to the movies.   The ""Stasis Interrupted"" DLC is a HUGE improvement over the original game, absolutely terrifyingly atmospheric in places - I greatly appreciated that offering. All-in-all I consider Aliens: Colonial Marines absolutely crucial to my collection, however; with the source material available this game could have been a LANDMARK in gaming.    Overall The game was rushed, and mundane FPS shooter with wonderful graphics but a thin, non-existent story. The ending is abrupt and left wide-open to a sequel which I'm sure was the intention. The Marines look great, the iconic weapons are there... (Even if the you can't hit the broadside of a barn with the pulse rifle) The levels are dark and highly detailed with familiar places and feel to the movies. It's empty though put out to make a buck.If you are a Die-Hard like me ? The game is a must-have for your collection. BUY-IT !If you're looking for a state of the art FPS with top-notch mechanics and story not caring about the Aliens movie or franchise? Let this title float right under your motion-tracker...It's not as terrible as most of the reviews say it is... "

												I am a fan of the Aliens series and found this game as-is is not a bad game at all.  However, the story is severely lacking in development.  The AI is meh to say the least, and the Reward Systems leave MUCH to be desired.  It really would have been nice if the publisher had updated the Rewards system upon releasing additional content for the game.  The reason being, it would make tracking progress much easier.  The DLC Bug Hunt and Stasis Interupted pretty much MAKE this game.  As much as I would enjoy seeing more content for this game, I'm afraid that is unlikely at this point.My suggestion would be to wait for a Steam Sale to purchase this game and any of the DLC.			"

												Been playing Aliens FPS games since the 90s right.  Remember that PC Doom 2 mod?  Alien TC (Stood for Total Conversion as they called mods that virtually replaced all game content with something new)  I believe this was the first 'Aliens' style FPS experience back in the 90s, then the Atari Jaguar had a good Aliens Vs. Predator game, but it was kind of hokey and not so atmospheric as the previous mentioned.  Buncha sprites bouncin around and weird view angles.  Basically what I'm trying to say is since I was 12 I've been enraptured by the idea of meshing the FPS experience with the Aliens universe.  I've played em all, and lots of multiplayer for each.  Sure this game had a few bugs, but the reviews it got were simply unjust and mostly from players that never really gave it a chance.  This is actually a hidden gem and the most complete and modern, well designed Aliens first person shooter experience you're gonna get. Playing the Coop with a friend, we actually felt like marines, one guy with a smart gun, one guy holding the motion detector, sharing quietly what the radar blips are saying.  All in the dark recesses of ships trying not to wake the bugs, or facehuggers.  Which you better shoot off your friends face quickly when it laches.  Anyhow it just works.  It was a solid game, the Aliens are terrifying for once as well.  Never had any horrible game bugs ruin my experience as they say.  The film grain issue was indeed bs though.  But its a beautiful game, ran well on my older PC even.			"

												Can´t undersstand all the hating....I bought this game with season pass and in short: Its great!!!The details:Grafics: Unreal Engine. Enviroment is nice, Charaters a bit ugly but fully ok. I read a review that the ships internals are all look the same: ""Man, why should a spaceship look different from room to room???""Sound: GoodHandling: Characters handle well.Difficulty: ""Veteran"" could be a bit hard. Starting with ""soldier"" in a single player campaign is hard enough for most players. If you play Coop Campaign you should raise the difficulty.Localization: German loc. has some funny points like ""waldmannsheil"" and the ""ooorah"" sounds a bit bored but it is ok. A few funny moments if u accept the ""marines"" style. Story: Good and fun to play. When i finished one of the ten (i think) chapters i was always willing to play the next. There are dozens of allusions to the movies (mainly Alien2) and lots of the story plays in the moviesetting. !Spoiler!: The appearens of ""Hicks"" is completly explained if u listen to the text at chapter seven.Playing: All weapons from the movies, which could be adepted to your playstyle. There are six epic weapons that could be found in the campaign. (And again) I read a review that the maps are so linaer: ""Man, yes they are!!! If they are not you will found nothing in the game"" (btw: They are quite big and if your NPC wont lead the way you will find nothing). Your only may is your motiontacker. This handy device shows you the way. A bit...and it makes no differnence if object are down or above you... MultPlayer: CoopCampaign and a few versus games. In MP you could fully customizes your Marine or Xeno Character. Really nice...Overall: Great game (by now). A lot of fun to play for Alien Friends and highly replayable if you have friends that play the game with you.			"

SPOILERS people are complaining about the amount of human enemies in this game, but this game is focused on the marine experience and closely reflects marine behaviour in the Aliens movie. Essentially this game is the only way it could be for it to make sense.			"

												Okay so it's not the best game but the patches have solved the problem of skittle the dancing alien.  If you're a fan of the film it's worth picking up at bargain price - I paid £2.99 in GAME for a physical copy and for that I'm happy with what was quite an enjoyable, if clunky, single player campaign.  The weapon sounds from the films are excellent and some of the things your fellow marines say are right on the whole feel of the marines from the films.  Plus using the msart gun feels soooo good.

												First of all I would like to say that I had this game pre-ordered almost a year before it had come out. But since a lot of PC games are hit or miss I decided to wait for the reviews before I picked up my game. After about a week of reading all of the terrible reviews I decided to cancel my pre-order and put it towards something else. As time went on I forgot about the game and that was that. Then the other day here on Steam I found the game on sale for $4.99, I decided to look into it and see if there had been any improvements since last I cared to look. I saw nothing positive really and basically the only reviews or information I could find were from the original release, there was nothing current that I could find. Then while searching, I found a video on youtube dated 2014, I decided to watch it and have this help me make my final decision. After just the first few minutes I thought everything looked really cool and it seemed to play exactly how I had hoped. Upon some more research I found out that they had released a 4gb patch back in august 2013 to address all of the issues, but at this time nobody wanted to bother to re-review it since so much time had passed. I decided for $5 it may be worth checking out. So I purchased a copy for myself and my 2 other friends also got copies for themselves. We got everything installed and waited for the weekend. I must also add that we are huge L4D2 fans and with the almost endless supply of user maps we have logged over 300 hours since it's release. We also play ARMA2 and 3, with at least that many hours if not more into ARMA2, Rainbow 6 and before they messed it up with the last release, Ghost Recon. So we have quite a bit of experience with co-op campaign games and know what we like and what we don't. So finally the day came, we each loaded up the game and I created a LAN Co-op Campaign game and my friends logged in. From the moment the cut scene was over I was pleased with what I saw, despite what the reviews had said I thought the game looked pretty good. I had everything cranked up as high as it would go and I was loving it. When I had to open my motion tracker and heard that familiar sound my heart began to race. Then once I saw my first alien crawling across the ceiling towards my team I knew I was hooked. We could not get enough of this fantastic game and after playing for 9 hours straight only pausing for food, we finished nearly 60% before having to stop and go back to the real world. I don't know if that 4gb patch actually fixed everything that was wrong with the game or if people were just being over critical, but I felt the $5 I spent was well worth it and I still would have been happy had I paid more. I only have a minor issue, but this can be said about a most games after I have gotten used to the modabilty and user maps of L4D2 and ARMA2/3...I wish the game was longer or at the very least had user maps available. Yes I know there is DLC to add on a few more maps, but I could easily see myself and my friends logging 300 hours with this game if there were the maps to support it. If you like L4d2 then trust me, I believe you will also like this. I would like to thank the publishers for what I think is an awesome game and if you had ever been interested in this game or saw the movie and would like to be a part of it then I think  you owe it to yourself to give this a shot and see how well they did.

												I really can't understand the hate for this game that most have. Granted, I didn't buy it until well after the various, weighty patches were put in to play...but now that they are, I'm just not seeing a whole lot of reason for any hate. The graphics are awesome, especially with that ""film grain"" option turned on, the gameplay is solid(standard FPS fare) and though the story wasn't what most were hoping for, it's still an entertaining tale. The game has its issues, like every other game ever made does, but they're just not enough to bring down the overall experience, which I would say is a very enjoyable one.			"

												Whilst disappointed with this game myself, having pre-ordered the collectors edition (that powerlifter figurine is very cool), if you were to pick this up on sale, forewarned with the knowledge that it's NOT what the game trailers said it would be, you can still have some fun with this game. Particularly if you are a Huge Alien fan like I am. I have enjoyed playing the game, it's just not what it was meant to be.Don't spend lots of money on this game, pick it up on sale, and when you have nothing to play on a rainy Saturday, dust this one off of the pile of Shame and spend a few hours with a pulse rifle taking down Aliens. Just don't expect too much from it			"

												Great game (after patching - apparently it's full of bugs before that, and not just the acid-for-blood type).Really feels like the Aliens movie and has an excellent story that fits into the movie stories perfectly. I found the graphics outstanding, especially in their authenticity of the Aliens locations, armour, weapons, tech, etc. Action is terrific and the creatures' motion and attacks are, again, dead-on for the movie.Working my way through the DLC now, which is very worthwhile and long compared to the DLC's of other games (I estimate I've played for over 6 hours so far, though I do like to explore everywhere and see everything... and I get killed fairly regularly).Sad that the original release of a very unpolished version of the game made A:CM a flop. There's obviously a lot of work and love gone into the game, all presumably ruined because some jerk somewhere decided to release the game too early.			"

												I'm a big fan of Aliens-themed videogames. Two of my all time favorites were created by Rebellion software, Aliens vs. Predator on the Atari Jaguar and the first PC release of the same title. Both of those games are at the top of my Aliens list and over the years since then there have been quite a few Aliens games that failed to deliver the same level of atmosphere and excitement. The majority have been flops in my opinion. So I was skeptical when I heard about Aliens Colonial Marines. I found out about ACM shortly before it's release so I was unaware of it's long development cycle. I did not see early dev screenshots or short videos of in-game play which allowed me to keep an open mind about it.The storyline of ACM takes place almost immediately after the end of the film Aliens and it returns the player to a plotline focused around events on LV426. To me, this was pretty much a re-run on a plot since the first Aliens vs. Predator PC title also returned the player to LV426. The difference between the two however is AVP had a more interesting story that made sense and presented a much more plausible mystery. ACM's plot is heavily scripted with a large amount of character dialogue and cutscenes that aimed to make it more of a film experience than a game which becomes a little tiresome after a while. Thankfully your trusty escape key can bypass that noise and get you back into the action.ACM is restrictive as you progress through each area. You cannot explore much or find your own way, everything is blocked off which forces players through as if they are on a train track. I would have liked many sections of the game a lot more if players had the ability to take multiple routes or blunder your way to the next objective. Instead it feels more like an arcade light gun game where you are corralled into the next tough spot and have to blast your way out. It's tolerable and at times pretty fun but it could have been better. Graphically ACM got many bad reviews. I think this is partly due to people who were following the development of the game over a long period of time and were expecting something else than the finished product. Also, some players complained that the quality of the graphics looked like something out of the mid 1990's. That simply isn't the case. ACM looks awesome and really captured the look and feel of Aliens from the film. The Aliens themselves look very realistic. It is spot on and has some great effects. I have to conclude that people who think ACM's graphics are lacking and compare it to a 90's videogame probably weren't around back then and were born with a silver Pentium in their mouth.Overall I enjoyed the single player campaign despite the gameplay shortcomings and less than inventive story. Replayability was better than average due to being able to play through all the single player missions on co-op with friends as well as being able to increase the difficulty level to it's hardest setting. Ultimate Badass difficulty makes ACM more of an entertaining challenge to play. Once all that is finished though players will find themselves stuck with very poorly executed multiplayer choices and a majority of DLC content that is fairly dull. Of the DLC, Bug Hunt and Stasis Interrupted are the only two items to definitely get. The rest I would completely avoid. Here's why. The multiplayer server setup is completely broken. If you are looking to play Team Deathmatch, Survivor, or some of the other options available more than likely you'll be stuck waiting for 20 minutes without finding any players. Generally the system can't find anybody and will simply time out. You are better off 'friending' other players in the ACM community and linking up with them if you want to try to play those game modes.Bug Hunt offers the best multiplay option. It's a ton of fun and you will have to work together in a four person team in order to survive. Each of the three maps are well laid out with strategically placed drops of equipment and supplies. The catch to this is- you have to earn the ability to access them through kills. The more enemies you kill, the more loot you get. More loot means you can buy your way into a locked building or open up a crate full of ammo. Players will also fare better if they choose to pool their resources and cash together which is a nice touch. If you happen to have loads of space bucks you can gift some of it to a less fortunate Marine which will allow them to buy back in after being killed, or buy them a smart gun and toss it their way. Stasis Interrupted is the other worthy DLC. It is another single player campaign with the choice of also playing co-op. This add on builds the ACM story from a prequel timeline and explains more of the overall plot. Unlike the main single player campaign this has a bit more of an exploration feel to it and was not as restrictive which is a nice change of pace.Overall I think Aliens Colonial Marines is pretty good. Yeah, it has issues and some things could have been implemented better but I do enjoy this game. If you are a fan of the Alien franchise I say grab your body armor, light up a flamethrower and pick up a copy of ACM. It's bug stompin' time!			"

												Ok this is my first review and I am usually brutal with games. If I am not hooked in the first hour that is generally where the timer stops. When I first bought this game it was on special and gave up during the campaign second level, and thats where it sat, for ages, for a lot of the reasons well desribed in the many negitive reviews  Then during a super special I bought two extra copies and the DLC's only to be disappointed that no one plays multiplayer (and they still don't) BUT... in amongst the DLC is BUGHUNT. It is many times better than Alien vs Preditor ""survivor"" mode. There are 30 waves of Aliens and Enemy Corporate soldiers to burn, blast, grenade, smart gun, RPG, claymore, and one of my favorites the multi auto gun turret choke point to death. The catch is you earn money for kills which is spent on opening up steel doors, lifts, more ammo , more smart guns , etc etc and each wave shows it threat value as a percentage. 45-85% is easy as while you move about planning and deployed turrets. 110%-145% Aliens get brutal and you start taking casualties, unless you activate up to five suppressors around the map which reduce threat levels. Even so by level 30 gun turrets are glowing red, ammo is short supply and threat levels enemy numbers are well up. Sounds a little confusing but you can pass money about to get things open and achieved, set up turrets where you think is a good final stand, revive downed team mates , shoot aliens off them too. We even played through the co-op campaign and dlc levels to increase our gun options we can take into bughunt, which although fairly b.s. as most have described not as bad either and the second half is better than the first. DLC storyline.... omg  3/10Graphics.... enough said already 4/10sound.....yea its a pulse rifle 5/10campaign 3/10Co-op campaign 6/10co-op Bughunt 8.5/10 (negitives are); You need friends to play multi, sometimes the AI goes Awol, only 3 maps, and you are stuck with your two chosen guns for the whole 30 levels.Overall: I would have been f and c if I paid original price for this but if you see on super special with bughunt DLC have a crack with your mates. The first time we hit level 30 I don't think I stopped smiling :)P.S. How can you play 20-30-40 hours of this game and give a neg review. If I get 10 Hours from a game these days I consider that bang for my buck			"

												A game that deserves a lot more than it got. I absolutely loved the game and everything about. I pre-ordered the game, the only game I have pre-ordered or even spent more than $20 on steam and it was absolutely worth it! If you enjoy the Alien franchise and fun first person shooters this is the game for you.True the game is flawed and not perfect, and the multiplayer match finder is incredibly bad. However there is no greater thrill being one of four colonial marines with your friends in an abandoned starship watching your motion sensor beep at the oncoming aliens. Setting up sentry turrents, running out of ammo, losing squadmates along the way, welding doors. It's all a blast!My particularily favorite game modes are Escape, Survival and Bug Hunt. However due to the smaller player base now and the terrible match finder the first two game modes mentioned (escape survival) are almost impossible to set up.I do believe this game was rushed and I also do believe it could have been significantly better; however when I look at my steam library there are far and few games that jump out and scream play me on LAN night. Aliens Colonial Marines is an exceptional gem in the Aliens Universe and perfect for any avid fan.			"

Yes it has a few bugs still and some parts of the game are a bit dopey (O'neals face) but overall so far its been fun playing through with my brother. Now i've not played Alien Isolation yet but have seen a lot and I would say out of the current three Aliens games this is easily the least scary... in single player that is. IN a 1 vs 1 multiplayer where you play as a marine and your opponent is the ALien you can have a whole heap of jump scare fun!I would definitely recommend it to fans and non fans a like, its just an all round fun game.

												Well, i took the plunge and bought this game..more for a laugh really. Turned out much better than i thought. Not perfect though. Baring in mind This is after the big patch and only single player campaign. (plus got it for £2) I thought it was entertaining enough...plenty to keep you occupied. Visiting the old Movie sites like Hadleys hope, Sulaca and many more. Lots of weapons to use and upgrade. The story is so so, not that i really cared. Its all been done before but was playing this as a huge Aliens fan. To me the game DOES make you feel like your in the Aliens universe. Amazing sounds from weapons and aliens. The motion tracker is awesome but just having it on and listening ..you'll think your watching Aliens....although a pain when you have to switch back to gun before being eaten.  All in All i would recommend this game...even for those who arent major Aliens fans the games worth the steam price (even though i didnt pay it) and id go as far as saying better than a lot of other FPS games at the same price.

												A lot of the complaints I have heard about Aliens: Colonial Marines were justified on release. Since then most of the issues that I am aware of have been patched. The Alien AI is better and very lethal. They like to run on the ceiling when you are destracted by their buddies and drop down behind you. I have died many times to this before I adapted. There are a few remaining issues but those are mainly minor irritants. The AI will still get stuck and get left behind at times, but when you reach the objective or checkpoint they teliport to you and carry on as normal. The price right now is $2.99 (80% off steam sale) and during this time it is more then worth the price. If you do decide to pick up the game I highly recommend buying Stasis Interupted. The DLC adds several more missions and gives explanation to what happened aboard the Suloco after it left LV-426 at the end of Aliens.			"

The sound is perfect, from the blasts of the pulse rifles to the groans of dilapidated doors trying to open, the graphics are not bad for 360/ps3 era gen and are very much the same as alien vs predator (sega not rebellion) although the gun models are much better here.All in all its not perfect but really does not deserve all the negativity... oh and being negative about a game because it has dlc is lame, its a thing and its here to stay, it dosnt mean you have to buy it to enjoy the game, most dlc i know of is mostly useless anyway and dosnt add much to the game, its just a crass money making scheme, either buy it or ignore it... like i mostly do :P			"

												I am willing to recommend this game to Aliens fans with enough imagination to make up for what this game lacks in pretty much every aspect. The biggest gaming disappointment of my life, this game is the buggiest (no pun intended), ugliest, waste of potential I have ever seen come from a AAA studio. I am so glad SEGA had the nuts to put out Alien: Isolation after this, or this definitely would've been the franchise killer. I heard a lot of people say multiplayer was the saving grace of this game, but I couldn't tell you since nobody plays, and why would they? If you really really love the Aliens franchise and you want a decent story to play through on co-op with a friend, I say go for it. It's hard to recommend paying even the Steam price for the game its just so horribly underwhelming. It has a decent weapon arsenal and progression system, with unlocks that carry over into multiplayer (but there is no player base so it doesnt matter) and some of the new Alien designs are cool, but this game is the lowest point of the franchise coming between AvP 2010 (a great game, go check it out), and Alien Isolation (also an amazing game), and possibly to blame for the lower than expected sales of Alien Isolation. Buy if your expectations are in check.P.S. The game is more fun on the hardest difficulty, but you have to turn it down when you reach a boss battle because those are 100% impossible on the hardest difficulty, not because they are challenging, but they are so mechanically wonky that you will constantly get stuck on something and die instantly or the mechanics are simply broken.P.P.S. Check out TemplarGFX's ACM Overhaul, it's a great mod and makes the game a lot better.			"

												I'm treading lightly here, for a number of obvious reasons and I'm probably going to get lynched for this review.Apparently this game was a mess on release. I never really had the misfortune of playing the unmodded, unpatched version. If you do happen to purchase or play this game, three things you absolutely must do. ...1 - Buy the game when it goes on sale, even with all the fixes it's still probably sub-par with what is acceptable. 2 - Download the Templar GFX ACM overhaul mod and modify the .ini files (Google it), it will turn the game into something a little more what it should have been.2 - Having followed the previous step, play the game with an open mind, play it for it's single player campaign and try not to jump on the herd mentality bandwagon, I'll explain why in a moment. There are a number of things you'll get out of this game if you're only playing single player. It holds true to the atmosphere in a big way, one thing they got right was those moments you look around and appreciate what they've created. Going to places in the Aliens movies (even though they shouldn't really exist anymore...) brings back those nostalgic feelings of watching Aliens for the first time. There are a few scripted moments which were done well also. Some people might find the graphics a little dated or rubbish but I had no problems, I mean heck, with my 200+ backlog of games on steam I'm still playing games from early 2000....So ACM was a real treat graphically for me. Soundwise....well who does'nt like the sound of a pulse rifle or shotgun? The sounds are beefy and pack some punch. I lost interest in the story or only vaguely followed it because I knew there were a ton of obvious inconsistent moments with the Alien franchise. It didn't help that I was thinking ""oh here we go again, I've heard these lines in other games before"". To be honest, the voice acting was ok but the dialogue was....cheesy and cliche. I was not impressed by the constant frame dips, despite my PC being well above spec, I'm not the only person with this issue though, you really need to tweak a lot to get this game running and looking nice.My personal opinion is that yes, I'd recommend this game but only when the above suggestions are followed. I did actually enjoy it.  "

												gotta say this game is not a 45 as represented on meta score. It is much better than that.....especially now with all the bug fixes  that have been done. The only think lacking is the story...not the greatest but from a tech and playability perspective it is  pretty good. I'd give it a mid to high 70's score. If it is on a good steam sale it is really worth picking up for single player just ignore the story :-)   I wish multiplayer was active because I could see this game being really fun, unfortunately I have not found many people playing it.

												This game isn't the best game in the world; it has flaws, several of them in fact. The AI is pretty laughable; the graphics in game/cutscenes are early last gen. But what makes this game so bad is that the developers Gearbox (they made the Borderlands games, Half Life 1 expansions and Duke Nukem Forever) lied and over hyped the game to ridiculous lengths that the previewed game is nothing like the finished product (See E3 videos), the game much like Duke Nukem Forever (also done by Gearbox...) was in development hell for most of the last decade and became vapourware and a bad internet joke. However the finished product here does have a few redeeming qualities to it, it is enjoyable in co-op with friends, the campaign is pretty OK (nothing spectacular to write about), the multiplayer is great (the Aliens have a good control scheme) and the best part is that there is a Left 4 Dead esque co-op/verses multiplayer campaign that is great but is basic. The DLC is OK and is worth a look at (when the Season Pass is cheap).Pros:- Good gameplay (OK shooter).- Full controller support.- Good multiplayer and co-op game modes.- Easy Achievements.Cons:- Poor game package overall (since this is an AAA game).- Graphical not good, considering the E3 trailers on older builds looked better.- Crap AI.- Multiplayer scene is almost dead, despite it being a redeeming feature of the game.5/10TL:DR: Buy this game in a Steam Sale along with the Season Pass along with a few buddies and play through the Campaign/Multiplayer and have a few laughs.

												I'm going to do my best not to write a very long review, but i would like to say on a positive note that at the very least they saved my favorite character from the Aliens franchise from being killed in Alien 3, byadding this into cannon and explaining how someone else actually died in his place. Although honestly the restof this game was weak tea, I didn't buy the game to be an ultimate badass and fight..people :/ i bought this gameto play the role of an ultimate badass and take on hordes upon hordes of acid bleeding terryfying monsters fromthe abyss. I felt heartbreakingly disappointed with this game. In its own rite it has some pretty neat things..but it was not enough to save it. My biggest worry is that this will have stolen potential for the aliens franchise, and detercreators who actually have a desire to see Aliens Colonial Marines become what it was always meant to be from the very beginning, and i'm talking about it's first inception back in (i'm taking my best guess at remembering) 2004 when it wasplanned for the playstation 2.  In conclusion, i feel as though its worth knowing what happens here in ACM, but it's not worth paying for.  So with a heavy heart i am going to say i Do Not recommend buying this game. Borrow it from a friendor do some ""force recon"" if you know what i mean, but don't waste your money.			"

												Now I understand why Alien Isolation's sales were slow or poor.A lot of people were turned off of Sega's line of Alien games because of this game.  For those people who have refrained from buying Alien Isolation:  RETHINK IT...   AI is a superior game to a lot of games out there and it is more Survival Horror (like Outlast only better) than anything.Alien Colonial Marines is ""imitation CoD"" mixed with some of the older Playstation Alien games from the 1990's. Graphics wise you can see there is a mix of good and bad.   Some computer screens you come across look great.. others are so blocky and out of focus it makes you wonder if it were merely copied and pasted in a rush.The Multi-player, at least the co-op seems fun --at first.   Then you realize that even the Bughunt DLC requires 4 players... which is not good.   Should have been 2-4 per team.The A.I. for your allies in single player mode is awful.  You save marines...  and then some of them stand there like idiots instead of doing what they need to do like...  getting back to basecamp.The main story is not great and could have been done better...  there should have been more ""helping marines live"" so they can help you defend in certain spots later on (i.e the more you save the bigger the group you'll have later etc).Locking doors so you cannot run back and get the Auto-turret for one scene was not a good idea either.There were some interesting spots, like wandering around in the sewers against the elderly aliens (lol).... but even that entire scenerio could have played out better or scarier.I will say that I think some of the DLC's helped this game (I'm told Bughunt is good when you got enough friends to actually get it going)...   and the ""Statis Interrupted"" DLC was interesting.  Similar to Alien Isolation (perhaps like a rough draft of it)... where you are a chick and go around without weapons and find your way to point B...  All in all... this game could have...  should have been better.  Multi-player was not appealing at all.  Period.  Sega NEEDS TO LEARN how to set up Lobby systems.The lobby system in Mount & Blade: Warband, for example,  is EASY and not limited in what you can set up.  This game's multiplayer was a huge turn-off.I got one friend on here who has the game and we are trying to do the Co-op game and so far it's going okay ... but we don't have enough to do other multiplayer maps.  sigh.One final word to those who can still do patches:It is never too late to do a game over-haul patch.   You can fix some issues for the game and perhaps clean up some of the bugs.  Gearbox, this dud is on your reputation, not the company you tried to outsource to.You guys are going to have to live with all the negative reviews unless you can heed this suggestion and fix what you know needs to be fixed.Alien Isolation's sales... suffer because you guys dropped the ball.Fix your bugs please.

Aliens:Colonial Marines (ACM as I will be referring to it in this review.) is a First-Person Shooter developed by Gearbox Interactive,best known for their critically acclaimed Borderlands series, and published by SEGA.The game features both a campaign that could be played alone or with friends and a versus multiplayer mode(Though I will not be talking about MP at all as both it and the Co-op are dead and there is nobody to play with for now. I'll edit with that once I can find people to play with).Now with a strong company like Gearbox leading this charge into well-franchised territory what could go wrong? Well for starters,the game was originally announced in 2006 and was set to release in 2008. However, the developers delayed it so many times that the game ended up releasing in 2013. That is absolutely ridiculous for a game being made by a AAA company and published by a giant like SEGA.Also the fact that they made a game with so many flaws and basically unfinished parts shows me that they really didn't care about fans or the series but instead they just wanted to make a cash-in title. The developers also had law suits and infighting but for this review I am going to try to focus mostly on the game and less on the shady practices of the developers.

The singleplayer of ACM was honestly pretty bad due to the fact that most of it just felt. . . unfinished.The main story follows you,a marine named Winter, as you respond to a distress call sent out by the USS Sulaco. Then chaos erupts as you go into the Sulaco only to find it a xeno-ridden hellhole.As you try to escape,the umbilical connecting the Sulaco to the USS Sephora gets destroyed since one of the marines you rescued,Keyes,would rather blow himself up than be killed by the facehugger parasite inside him.The rest of the story is incredibly cliche with lots of ""No marine left behind,Oorah to ashes""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.The final boss fight was the most depressing thing I have ever seen in my life. You're objective is to vent the Xeno queen out of the bulkhead before you reach the atmosphere and you all suffocate.There's no timer and the objective consists of avoiding the queen so you can flip 5 different switches,then lining her up in front of a chute and flipping another switch.Then there was the ending cutscene that was the most obvious and cheesy cliffhanger I have ever seen and left you  just sitting there like . . . really? The graphics are absolutely trash as well. They look like they just pulled the graphics straight out of 2008 itself. Multiple rendering issues where sometimes the game will just make you play with nothing rendered in,texture quality that makes the game look like its a bad oil painting,and character models that make Minecraft look good.The graphics are just such a letdown from a game so long in the making. The gunplay was actually pretty good and that was the main point I really enjoyed about the campaign. I would get lost in the adrenaline while fighting the bugs,not so much the humans,but I really liked the sections where you had to defend a certain point for a set amount of time. These segments would have you loading up and preparing before being overwhelmed by the xenos pouring over the battered ramparts.These were crazy fun and I loved the combat in this game overall. There's about 11 different weapons in the game,ranging from your standard pulse rifle all the way to a flamethrower or even a smart gun. Each weapon,save the flamethrower and smart gun,can be fully customized with a variety of different attachments like a magazine for your shotgun or a suppressor for your pulse rifle and there's even skins for each weapon. During the campaign you may find weapons with a star above them;these are legendary weapons and they're either weapons related to a character in the Aliens story or just an upgraded version of the normal weapon.There's a total of 6 legendary weapons and they cannot be upgraded at all but once you pick one up you can use it throughout all of your different playthroughs. All-in-all the weapon system is actually pretty decent;nothing new but in this sea of complete garbage it's nice to see even the smallest of diamonds.The Wrong Kind of Bugs

ACM has more bugs than I would believe possible in a single game. Sometimes the enemies will literally teleport from across the map or in the worst cases,appear from nowhere and strike you. I have had a section where I died and then respawned instantly without a loading screen in between. This made me unable to kill anyone and the enemies didn't detect me,they just stood there and I had to reload a checkpoint. Honestly I expect some bugs when a game is fresh out, but for a game supposedly in development for 7 years I have no sympathy for devs who literally filled their game with more game bugs than xenomorphs.TL;DRAliens:Colonial Marines is a poor game in almost every regard.Poor story,writing,graphics,and just about everything else under the sun.The only thing that made this even tolerable were the rare moments when it all comes together for a slight glimpse into what this game could have been.If you enjoyed this writing and want to read more of such reviews,check out my steam curator page at Mudkips Gaming "

I put it on Ultimate Badass and thought maybe some challenge would make it cool...but the hardest difficulty is still a walk in the park for the most part.The worst part about this game is walking through areas and seeing what they had in mind and seeing the missed potential of every section.This could have been a good game. It really could have been. So it's not just that it's a truly terrible game, it's that it could have been a truly fun and terrifying game that would have made fans of the film cheer.But they gave us this.

During the campaign you may find weapons with a star above them;these are legendary weapons and they're either weapons related to a character in the Aliens story or just an upgraded version of the normal weapon.There's a total of 6 legendary weapons and they cannot be upgraded at all but once you pick one up you can use it throughout all of your different playthroughs. All-in-all the weapon system is actually pretty decent;nothing new but in this sea of complete garbage it's nice to see even the smallest of diamonds.The Wrong Kind of Bugs


Something's Missing 
A Screenshot of Aliens: Colonial Marines
By: Friedmudkips ツ #FreeMilo




ACM has more bugs than I would believe possible in a single game. Sometimes the enemies will literally teleport from across the map or in the worst cases,appear from nowhere and strike you. I have had a section where I died and then respawned instantly without a loading screen in between. This made me unable to kill anyone and the enemies didn't detect me,they just stood there and I had to reload a checkpoint. Honestly I expect some bugs when a game is fresh out, but for a game supposedly in development for 7 years I have no sympathy for devs who literally filled their game with more game bugs than xenomorphs.TL;DRAliens:Colonial Marines is a poor game in almost every regard.Poor story,writing,graphics,and just about everything else under the sun.The only thing that made this even tolerable were the rare moments when it all comes together for a slight glimpse into what this game could have been.If you enjoyed this writing and want to read more of such reviews,check out my steam curator page at Mudkips Gaming "

												I honestly don't know why people say this was a horrible game. This game was fun, well when people still played it. The campaign wasn't that great and it was kinda boring but the multiplayer was great and i had a blast playing it. I have not experienced any problems with this game at all. There are worse games then this, it wasn't that bad, i'd like to see you do better. So stahp acting like this is the worst game ever and get over it.			"

												Awsome game!Yes I agree the graphics are poor and the game mechanics are poorly written.Doesnt change the fact that its really FUN! ESP Team Deathmatch.Finding players can be hard but I have found if you join the group and enter the groups chat room and just leave it open while your playing then others will check out the group chat and see that your in a game and join your session.NOONE WILL BE IN THE GROUP CHAT when you 1st enter it most of the time but just start a game and leave the chat window open. Others will come.Worked for me had a 10 player game of Team Deathmatch because of this and it was awsome.Use the group chat ppl thats what its for.			"

												Despite harsh critical reviews, and I admit the game was in a rough state when first released, this game is it stands today is entertaining. Yes  it has a fairly lame campaign but there is enjoyment to be had if you're an Aliens fan, if not perhaps you might want to give this a miss.The DLC is where this game really shines IMHO, Bug Hunt is worth the price of the admission and offers a gritty Aliens experience. Overall not the greatest game in the world, but plenty of fun to be had. "

												Despite the hundreds of complaints, probably even thousands, this game is amazing. If there were any issues, they're fixed now. The story fits in with the actual story, despite many complaints, and the controls are tight, and if they're too tight, there's sensitivity for a reason. All in all, there's plenty of rain, plenty of tense situations, and while there is one frustrating boss fight, it was for me thought lots of people had an easy time, it's really fun. That, coupled with tons of DLC? Well, you can spend hours playing this.			"

												I tried to play this game single player initially and didnt enjoy it, however when I played this game in co-op with a friend it was much more enjoyable. If this is on sale I would definately recommend it if you are buying it with a friend, but would warn against purchasing for the single player experience. I wont spoil the ending but found it disappointing to say the least, but again at under £4 it was probably worth the money.			"

												Only get this game if you get it from the Amazon sale for $1.99.  Thats about all its worth.  Multiplayer seems to be DOA at this point, but for $2 you and 3 friends can have a couple of hours of roaming dark halls together while shooting REALLY stupid ai aliens that jump out at you from every other corner (think Doom 3 monsters).  Just watch out for AMD drivers it tries to install at first run.			"

												First, I never player the release version which everyone hated.I have fully finished the latter patched version, and as an alien fan I enjoyed it thoroughly for its atmosphere.Only encountered minor bugs, and would love to go for second play-through in harder difficulty in co-op mode. Solid frame-rate and no crashes.Yes, the story is stupid and on line match-matching is broken. The game definitely was not worth its initial price tag.My thumbs up will go for the guys who patched the release version to an enjoyable campaign experience.			"

												I know what you are thinking: ""Is he mad? Has the syphilis finally driven him over the edge?"" Well, yes and no (I hope), but you should still consider this game despite all the negativity sourrunding it. Call this a ""recommendation of spite"". ACM isn't a game I would normally recommend. It isn't even a particulary good game by 2013 standards. (It would have been an excellent shooter by 2003 standards). But it is not the desaster people claim it to be. Not anymore, anyway. The game you will get now is not the game that got released back in march. They patched a lot of the biggest issues out of the game. Now, what makes the game special? Well, if you are part of the demographics that sports a y-chromosome you love the movie Aliens. You cannot ""not love"" this movie, it only means you haven't seen it often enough. Yet. And that game is just one long love letter/nerdgasm to the Alien franchise. The continued references to the movies are one of the biggest draws of this game. (mostly to Aliens, but also Alien, Alien³ and Prometheus. Which, btw are all the Alien movies ever made. No other movies were made. None. Full stop.) And they really did their homework. Sometimes even referencing stuff that was only in the script but never filmed. They even throw some nods towards the (most excellent) '90s Alien comic books (or graphic novels, as the fancy pants like to call them nowadays). This, combined with the unmatched sound effects and music of the franchise, makes this game a dream come true for the twelve year old in me that fell in love with the movie. Unfortunately, that is also just about it, when it comes to the good parts of this game. Combat is decent, but not spectacular. Level ""art design"" is perfect, right out of the movies, Level ""gameplay design"" is literally ten years behind. The story is not bad per se, but they overdo the nerdgasm part a pit in the end, shattering the suspension of disbeliev like the chest of XO Kane during dinner. The game is also very short, even if you are going collectables hunting. All said and done, I was very happy to check out the game despite the bad reputation, but I am also glad I only paid 10$ for it. TL:DR. An average shooter which plays (and sometimes looks) like it was made ten years ago. A must play for fans of the Alien franchise, but probably not worth the time and money for anybody else.			"

												I am having a hard time about whether to recommend A:CM or not.If you consider what the game could have been, and what it was shown to be before its publishing, then no, you absolutely must not buy or play this game. Go watch Aliens instead... you will have a pleasant 2 hours or so. If you choose the game, you will probably waste more time on a completely average game with some rare high points and mostly lows. The story is very generic, has too few aliens and too much CoD-type shoot-outs. The graphics is so-so, though in 2013, I would expect character models to be a billion times better (even with the patches). The gameplay quickly turns into Call of Duty - Some planet with Monsters edition, minus the new ideas that you sometimes got in CoD. Overall, whatever could be messed up in the creative department, Gearbox managed to mess up. Thanks Randy Pitchford for repeatedly saying, how much you care.If you like shooters, and do not insist on having multiplayer (as nobody plays anymore, even though it was kinda decent in parts), this game may still be for you. It does not do shooting badly... only it does not do much else. If you like Aliens fan fiction, so much so that you do not mind not-so-good writing (a somewhat uninteresting story in the Aliens universe, if I wanna be generous to this game), this game might have some nice parts for you. Also, the expansion adds quite a bit. If you like sci-fis, and are bored out of your skull, and do not mind wasting some money to try this game, it is probably a better alternative than staring at your wall (depending on what is on your wall, of course).I am a huge fanboy of Aliens and was thoroughly disappointed by this game, and quite honestly, started to really hate Gearbox for making it like this. (Check the internetz for the stories around development, if you like.) The game may not be as bad as it looks for people who liked Aliens - you might get a few good hours of play out of it if you did not.In addition, the BugHunt multiplayer mode was quite decent, and for some time, it is fun to play the story in co-op as well. Unfortunately, these days nobody plays multiplayer so only consider this if you have friends who also have the game.			"

												Enjoyed this game. I bought this game for cheap when it was on offer as I'd heard it had a lot of bad reviews and I wasn't prepared to spend a fortune on it but hey, £3 for a game that's single player, versus and 4 player co-op seemed like a good deal to me and it was. I enjoyed playing it with my mates co-op and within a few days of buying it we completed it but not because it was rubbish, because we played it with an open mind, made our own decisions about it and it was, for us, a good game. It has loads of aliens, of different types to blast into tiny pieces, some cool weapons and of course, the motion tracker from the films (which is very useful) and the graphics are pretty nice too.The co-op mode is just the single player story mode but with the addition of 3 friends playing along with you and the game was good fun, in parts a little challenging and can even make you jump when the aliens catch you off guard and appear from out of thin air, hiding in walls right in front of your face!I can only pick fault with one aspect of it from what I've played and that is simply the teleport system. When playing co-op if you wandered too far ahead from your team mates the game teleports them to you. Well, in theory thats what it's supposed to do but we discovered it would teleport you at random times! Sometimes if you were only a few feet from your team mates and there was no reason to, quite often it would do this whilst in a fire fight which was most annoying, yet at other points you could get almost half a level in front and it wouldn't teleport anyone anywhere. That was and so far is my only my pet hate about this game and once I've played it through some more I will update this review. This is a good game to play with friends from what I have played aside from the teleport system and I would recommend it to others.			"

												When this game grows up it wants to be Alien Isolation, or possibly Tetris.  It's a pretty confused game.To be honest the game play is distinctly average.  Not in an acceptable way which means you should take a risk buying it, but in a ""oh you bought it already,  don't cry....I'm sure you'll enjoy parts of it"" kind of way.  If they made the uninstaller into a mini game I'd have been left with more of a fuzzy feeling about it.  This game is a classic example of a game which uses existing IP to sell a broken dream - it uses the Aliens name but by god it sullies it.I've played a lot of games over the years but this is the only one so far to give me motion sickness.  Yay, Colonial Marines...not so much throw your hands up in the air as throw your lunch up.Update:  I hear the game can be significantly improved with mods, although I haven't tried them because of the motion sickness and I also now have Alien Isolation which is as close to being in the film Aliens as is possible in a game.

												TL:DR: Avoid! Avoid! AVOID! A buggy hell, crashes a lot, savegames get corrupted, profile reset, and no usable savegame system anyway. Good gameplay and nice GFX don't save this game.If any if the Steam guys reads this: REMOVE IT FROM THE SHOP PLEASE! Maybe they will fix the bugs then.I got the collectors edition, hoping it would be more stable than my ""free test version"" a few years ago, which crashed a lot. But this game is a buggy nightmare. The graphics are fine, the actual gameplay when playing in “Ultimate Badass” is good too. But in about one of four times I exit the game the progress is lost. Upon next start it shows ""added X DLC"" asks for setting the brightness, and I have to set up my controller config again. Just like when you fresh installed the game.It crashes constantly and those crashes can be very well reproduced. Doing the usual trick to backup ""userdata\STEAMID\49540"" to make extra saves does not work if you have any DLC, you will have to backup ""steamapps\common\Aliens Colonial Marines\installscript.vdf"" as well, or the game will reset your progress when trying to restore. This actually violates the Steam design. And even if you have several save-states that way you have to chance. If the would have made a decent savegame system it would have avoided a lot of frustration, but other things were more important.You also get the start-loop very often. You start the game, exit it, and Steam restarts it again. Especially annoying if the game crashes upon start. You must use countless workarounds to get a still dysfunctional game. And gearbox doesn't care S* to fix any of those bugs.			"

												This game destroyed my hopes and dreams.I remember being super excited about this game seeing it in the game informer way back when.  Now, after being salty about it for a few years, I decided to warn anyone away from this game.It's not good.It's bad.Gearbox lied to everyone about how they were taking care of the game.  All the pre release footage was just made specifically to bait and switch people.Don't buy this game, don't make the same naive decision to buy this game that I did.  Go buy yourself a couple of mc'chickens at Mc Donalds instead.			"

												There is alot of fuss about this game, ive completed it in 8 hours time, and have yet to try out the ""Stasis"" DLC. But there is some nice things about this game and some bad ones. (yes ive read alot of the other reviews)Plus side ++++Locations, and movie ""sets"", seen in the films, which i think is quite awesome.+""Legendary"" Weapons ( like Hicks' Shotgun) how awesome is that, quite if u ask me.. ;)+Squad members, yea well they do shoot at the xenomorphs, but have your gun ready just in case, aliens do tend to run straight for you, but least u get the kill right ;), (i did manage to save some bullets, one of the npc squad members took down a xenomorph all by himself, yes it can happen, smart guns ftw)+Weapons customization, that is quite nice, and the ability to change your weapon loadout on the run is awesome..+The story, is quite awesome aswell..+Certainly aint missing action..+Nice graphicsMinus side ----Wouldnt mind a longer campaign (i like ""long"" games)-BIG minus is, no Xenomorph campaign, that would have been awesome.-Bugs, very very few i encountered, among one was some of the sparks that wasnt ""shown"" correctly.-Well squad members not looking mean enough to get Xenomorphs attention, would help u getting a few breathers aswell.All in all i would give it 8.5/10And so i will recommend this if your an Alien fan :) "

												Honestly this game is better than I expected.  I was apprehesive to try this given the ""bait and switch"" gearbox pulled and the gripes with the AI and graphics, but actually I was pleasently suprised when I actually played it.  The aliens move more or less realistically and combat is actually pretty challenging.  My main complaint is the Ally AI as they have a tendency to move ahead too quickly and leave you hangning to take on hoards of Xenos on your own.  While this is very fitting to the nature of the Aliens film, it's frustrating in a game context because the AI is invincible and can barrell through a hoarde of xenos to rip a door and leave you a mile back trying to catch up.  Overall, I would reccomend this game, but by no means at full price.			"

												I never purchased this on release as too many negative reviews. Purchased it in sale and to be honest i was pleasantly suprised.Played it from the start on hard level and the difficulty made it a decent game, play on anything less and too easy. I loved the levels straight out of film although the consol like textures let the visuals down. Story line bearable and I found the variation pretty good and i loved the level without wepons and keeping quiet. Yes its not the game its hyped up to be but give it a chance and its a reasonable game in a fantastic aliens film like setting. Queen was far too easy to beat and the end and was a bit of an anti-climax.Again play on hard and you will enjoy it.			"

												The Story is very nicely made and you're getting really attached to it. The gameplay is nice and both Singleplayer and Coop-Modes are really fun to play. The Versus Mode isn't really going on, because there's a lack of actual players. Sure, the game is very clearly structured and there is only one single way through the Mission, but that makes the game not worse.

												In current state the game is playable and passed as mediore FPS with some ups and downs. The campaign is fairly long and with Stasis Interrupted DLC - the game offers plenty of ground to cover.The main game still shows signs of hastily published product presented as low res textures, clunky animations and bad AI. On the other hand Stasis Interrupted DLC feels it has received a lot more love.Paid 10 euros for the main game + Stasis Interrupted and I'm satisfied for the deal.Have a little patience to get past first 15 minutes and you have a fairly good shooter.70/100 (with DLC)			"

												I'm going to do my best not to write a very long review, but i would like to say on a positive note that at the very least they saved my favorite character from the Aliens franchise from being killed in Alien 3, byadding this into cannon and explaining how someone else actually died in his place. Although honestly the restof this game was weak tea, I didn't buy the game to be an ultimate badass and fight..people :/ i bought this gameto play the role of an ultimate badass and take on hordes upon hordes of acid bleeding terryfying monsters fromthe abyss. I felt heartbreakingly disappointed with this game. In its own rite it has some pretty neat things..but it was not enough to save it. My biggest worry is that this will have stolen potential for the aliens franchise, and detercreators who actually have a desire to see Aliens Colonial Marines become what it was always meant to be from the very beginning, and i'm talking about it's first inception back in (i'm taking my best guess at remembering) 2004 when it wasplanned for the playstation 2.  In conclusion, i feel as though its worth knowing what happens here in ACM, but it's not worth paying for.  So with a heavy heart i am going to say i Do Not recommend buying this game. Borrow it from a friendor do some ""force recon"" if you know what i mean, but don't waste your money.			"

												Now I understand why Alien Isolation's sales were slow or poor.A lot of people were turned off of Sega's line of Alien games because of this game.  For those people who have refrained from buying Alien Isolation:  RETHINK IT...   AI is a superior game to a lot of games out there and it is more Survival Horror (like Outlast only better) than anything.Alien Colonial Marines is ""imitation CoD"" mixed with some of the older Playstation Alien games from the 1990's. Graphics wise you can see there is a mix of good and bad.   Some computer screens you come across look great.. others are so blocky and out of focus it makes you wonder if it were merely copied and pasted in a rush.The Multi-player, at least the co-op seems fun --at first.   Then you realize that even the Bughunt DLC requires 4 players... which is not good.   Should have been 2-4 per team.The A.I. for your allies in single player mode is awful.  You save marines...  and then some of them stand there like idiots instead of doing what they need to do like...  getting back to basecamp.The main story is not great and could have been done better...  there should have been more ""helping marines live"" so they can help you defend in certain spots later on (i.e the more you save the bigger the group you'll have later etc).Locking doors so you cannot run back and get the Auto-turret for one scene was not a good idea either.There were some interesting spots, like wandering around in the sewers against the elderly aliens (lol).... but even that entire scenerio could have played out better or scarier.I will say that I think some of the DLC's helped this game (I'm told Bughunt is good when you got enough friends to actually get it going)...   and the ""Statis Interrupted"" DLC was interesting.  Similar to Alien Isolation (perhaps like a rough draft of it)... where you are a chick and go around without weapons and find your way to point B...  All in all... this game could have...  should have been better.  Multi-player was not appealing at all.  Period.  Sega NEEDS TO LEARN how to set up Lobby systems.The lobby system in Mount & Blade: Warband, for example,  is EASY and not limited in what you can set up.  This game's multiplayer was a huge turn-off.I got one friend on here who has the game and we are trying to do the Co-op game and so far it's going okay ... but we don't have enough to do other multiplayer maps.  sigh.One final word to those who can still do patches:It is never too late to do a game over-haul patch.   You can fix some issues for the game and perhaps clean up some of the bugs.  Gearbox, this dud is on your reputation, not the company you tried to outsource to.You guys are going to have to live with all the negative reviews unless you can heed this suggestion and fix what you know needs to be fixed.Alien Isolation's sales... suffer because you guys dropped the ball.Fix your bugs please.

												Not as bad as everyone says. Sure, this game did have a lot of expectation to live up to, but in the end, it does pay tribute to the Alien franchise. You get to explore LV-426 and the U.S.S. Sulaco, you get to wield the U.S.C.M. arsenal, and not to mention, you get to mow down a bunch of aliens. Not to mention the multiplayer (If there are any people on the servers though) is FREAKING INSANE AND AWESOME. The DLC for this game great; there's a movie map pack containing multiplayer maps from the Alien movies themselves, such as the Nostromo or Fury 161. Then there's Bug Hunt, an awesome gamemode similar to that of Nazi Zombies from CoD. There's also a seperate campaign you can download that really pays tribute to Aliens.  Sure, the alien A.I. may not be as good as it should be, but it's improved a lot since the initial release of the game. My only complaint though is the levels you have to fight the Weyland-Yutani mercs. It's annoying, but it isn't bad enough to ruin the overall game experience. Overall, I give this game a 7/10. "

												The best part of the game is the intro what you can watch on youtube for free. The game itself sucks. Very repetitive and counterintuitive. For example: I aliens always attack from the same angle when you repeat a certain part of the game. Throwing a grenade successfully is almost impossible.It is extremely hard even on an easier level. No community behind the game, no servers are available for multiplayer.I have bought this game for the hope that its a decent aliens game. Then uninstalled quite quickly. Later I have reinstalled again to give it a second chance, but after 30m of playing I have uninstalled it again, now for good.The game AVP was hell lot better 12 years ago.

												The game was fun, I only saw few graphical gliches, the difficulty was a bit too hard... and the ai is not the best, but the weapon customization and progression system was really well done, I might even say that the story was OK, not great, but ok. Overall its not perfect but its still fun			"

												I had very high expectations when I played ACM for the first time. Those expectations were sadly not met. Yet I took my time for a playthrough.Here are my Observations:The Game features awesome locations, good voice acting, quality storyline and some very good graphic effects. You get to visit several locations known from The Prometheus/Alien-Lore, and you encounter several well known movie-characters. Weapons and Upgrades are a neat addition to the armament known from the movies. You get the chance to collect several ""rare"" weapons from the characters involved in the Aliens-Movie. Sound FX are awesome as well!The entire single player campaign can be played in Co-Op. What I did like:> Gameplay in most situations was fast paced, adrenaline pumping straight forward.> The Aliens looked very good; also the new (spoiler) Alien lifeforms fit perfectly into the lore.> The Maps/levels were as good as it gets for the limited terrain (A Colony on a Planet, and SpaceShips)> about 9hrs to complete the Campaign is enuf, yet not too much.> Awesome GFX & SFX> Coop Campaign.What I did not like:> Sometimes, the AI was pretty dumb. Counts for friendlys standing in your way as well. > Repetitive gameplay> The beginning full of scripted sequences; something I personally do not like.> Bossfights were borderline stupidOverall I will recommend this game. Its been great fun!			"

												Note before review: I have only played the fully patched version and only on utlimate badass difficulty.Review:This is a good game, dont let the exaggerated reviews influence you, those were before the patches and mostly on consoles, its a fun game that recreates a lot of the Cameron`s film ambient, gamers looking for an experience similar to Alien should look for the upcoming Isolation title.The props are well modeled, locations too, the aliens are correct size for the second movie.I really think some people should watch the movie again, memory plays tricks.Its of course not without flaws, theres some a.i. mistakes, not unlike many other titles, including AAA ones. On multiplayer there are a few, for example there are blackouts and teleporting even when you are close to your teammates, i am assuming due to checkpoints, so its not that often in a campaign episode but its there.Graphics are ok, to me (and im biased because i like the franchise a lot) they are not on par with the effects from the latest AAA  titles, but good enough and they do give the feeling of the movie (except for the missed opportunity with dyniamic lightning), its important to note that the framerate is smooth (on an i5 3500k and GTX 670)  The regular pulse rifle is not exactly like the one in the movie, though the differences make it look a little more functional, if you look at the movie again, they will look a little bland, not like you remembered,  but you will soon unlock hudsons pulse rifle, and that one is just like the movie ones.Its an enjoyable game specially for fans of the franchise, and you should ONLY play it on ultimate badass difficulty, without a hud and no screen sights, it makes the moments in the game a little tighter.The AI isnt exceptional but the lurker aliens are enjoyable.I think a lot of reviewers should update their reviews for the PC version, the Aliens franchise (i mean the 2nd movie) is great for a thrilling FPS, they should keep doing and improving them.And please do something about the story in future games, thats a point were i coincide with the reviews, its extremely bland and shouldnt be canon, it barely serves to frame the game's episodes, a good story would have helped a lot.I would have loved to play inside the Sulaco when it came down. with all the aliens butchering everyone and going against the clock to evac it.another note:Gearbox should fix everything they told they would fix, at least to make up for the misguiding videos.one last thing:PLAY ITDont be like everyone else repeating a lousy review and it has a very low price from time to time (got it for $5 iirc), a lot of people are just repeating bad comments like a bad meme, and its certainly not true, its a good, enjoyable game that needed patching and Gearbox did misguide gamers with their videos, but its still an enjoyable game.

												Not as bad as everyone says. Sure, this game did have a lot of expectation to live up to, but in the end, it does pay tribute to the Alien franchise. You get to explore LV-426 and the U.S.S. Sulaco, you get to wield the U.S.C.M. arsenal, and not to mention, you get to mow down a bunch of aliens. Not to mention the multiplayer (If there are any people on the servers though) is FREAKING INSANE AND AWESOME. The DLC for this game great; there's a movie map pack containing multiplayer maps from the Alien movies themselves, such as the Nostromo or Fury 161. Then there's Bug Hunt, an awesome gamemode similar to that of Nazi Zombies from CoD. There's also a seperate campaign you can download that really pays tribute to Aliens.  Sure, the alien A.I. may not be as good as it should be, but it's improved a lot since the initial release of the game. My only complaint though is the levels you have to fight the Weyland-Yutani mercs. It's annoying, but it isn't bad enough to ruin the overall game experience. Overall, I give this game a 7/10. "

												The best part of the game is the intro what you can watch on youtube for free. The game itself sucks. Very repetitive and counterintuitive. For example: I aliens always attack from the same angle when you repeat a certain part of the game. Throwing a grenade successfully is almost impossible.It is extremely hard even on an easier level. No community behind the game, no servers are available for multiplayer.I have bought this game for the hope that its a decent aliens game. Then uninstalled quite quickly. Later I have reinstalled again to give it a second chance, but after 30m of playing I have uninstalled it again, now for good.The game AVP was hell lot better 12 years ago. This game is a pure waste of your money.			"

												Aliens Colonial Marines. Much like Duke Nukem Forever, its impossible for hardcore gamers to not instantly recognize the name.  Much like DNF, Colonial Marines has been in development for a very long time, since 2001 to be exact. Time would witness the game's stunted, postponed, and delayed development over the course of many years. Fans of both Aliens and Shooters would hold out an incredible amount of hope and patience for the release of a game that was sure to please everyone considering its long development cycle.That was a mistake we are all guilty for.After many screenshots, trailers, magazine articles, and interviews the game finally landed into our hands, was it worth the wait? Was it anything we expected it to be? Not exactly. From the beginning it was already evident that Colonial Marines suffered through a painful development process, with plenty of outsourcing, rewriting, and clashes between multiple developers working on it. The final result is a game that misses nearly every mark it should have struck perfectly, and leaves fans of the franchise and avid gamers with a feeling of utter disappointment. Every single thing about the game failed to please. This game is no doubt bound for the $2 bargain bin steam sale, and even then, is not worth the price of admission.THE GOOD:> Multiplayer is suprisingly decent (despite nobody playing it)> Enviroments are somewhat interestingTHE BAD- Horrific writing - Terrible Voice Acting- Lifeless and unlikable characters- Atrocious AI that charges you blindly- Shockingly bad ending- Dated Graphics- IS SUPPOSED TO BE OFFICIAL CANON- Boring Cutscenes/Setpieces- Aliens arent scary or threatening in the slightest- Everything Else THE UGLYThis is what we were promised. The game dosent look/sound/play anything like this. AT ALL.

 BOTTOM LINE:Even if you are a hardcore fan of both the franchise and shooters, this game will disappoint in every way. You might be thinking to yourself ""Its gotta be good for a few laughs, right?"" No. You'd be better off spending that money on a pack of gum. But if you decide to go ahead and get it anyway, be prepared to recite the famous lines of the film its based on:

												I like the Alien movies... well at least two of them, I also like first-person shooters, and I also like the idea of being stuck in space with some unknown aliens trying to kill you... and despite how much I like those things, this game manages to fail on just about every level so hard that it is almost impressive.In Colonial Marines you play as a marine (Obviously) named Winter, as a team is sent to investigate the Sulaco that is hovering somewhere above the planet LV-426, this game is set after the events of Aliens but before Alien 3, and the marines are looking for Ripley, Hicks, and the other missing marines, along the way they find Aliens (Shocking I know) and Weyland-Yutani mercenaries aboard the ship. As for the plot it actually has promise, given that this game was worked on by writers from Battlestar Galactica and is considered canonical in the Alien series would give one hope, sadly however as you play the game the way the story unfolds and the events that take place are subpar at best, without spoiling anything here I will say that by the end you will be shaking your head asking what exactly went wrong, from the disjointed emotions conveyed with below average voice acting even from the bigger names in the Alien franchise history that come back, to the sloppy and plot hole filled writing that in many ways make it seem more like Alien fan fiction then anything else.But enough about the story lets talk about the gameplay! ...It blows, the shooting feels clunky, none of the guns seem at all accurate and while I know that might be due to the guns in Aliens lore being kind of bad in the first place, when I attach a red dot sight to a gun and aim down it, I expect my bullet to go where the dot is, not below it, or to have the sight swimming back and forward enough that you actually are more accurate when you fire from the hip, and in the end none of that really matters because the enemy AI feels like it took the short bus to work, the Xenomorphs act more like giant bugs and rush you, though you can counter this by backpedaling as they are not really faster then you are, and will not try tactics like attacking from your sides except for the rare times when they throw hunters at you and even then they are easily bested.You will see Aliens running into the walls, failing about, blowing up, and otherwise acting more comedical then scary or threatening, but that is only part of the game, because luckily you get to fight human mercenaries as well, in an Aliens game... lets let that soak in for a moment.Overall this game just... bad, the multiplayer is not counted in all this due to no one in their right mind playing it, the game is littered with bad DLC, and the core gameplay and plot fails as both a regular game and a piece of fan service and I recommend staying as far away from this one as you can.Game Over, Man.

												Completed this when it came out, the story kept me going more than the game itself. Pleyed again recently, the graphics are not as bad as everyone makes out. I dont know if originally I played it before the 4gig texture upgrade, i suspect i did. Ok the alien model still doesnt look great and they have a tendancy to ignore NPC's and swarm straight for you. But i enjoyed it again nonetheless, If you can ignore the fact this was showcased with considerably better graphics than made it in to the final game and your a fan of the second film, buy it in a sale. 6.5/10			"

												This is NOT a bad game. Over hyped? Yes. A terrible game? NO! If you are a true Aliens fan (like me) you will appreciate this game. The graphics are mediocre, but bad graphics dont make a bad game. Controls are great. Also what really keeps you playing it is the fact you can find ""legendary weapons"". You may think theyre normal weapons with extra stats but theyre actually weapons from the Aliens movie. I highly suggest this game. 8/10			"

												Not worth it. With the latest patch, I had to re-play the first mission 8 times to beat it. On easy. And I don't think I'm bad at shooting stuff. So I left the game and watched a playthrough on YT. Repetitive gameplay, boredom and one of the worst final boss fights in the world were the hallmarks I'd point out about the rest. Too bad. If the game followed the movie's events and maybe expanded on some of the story, that'd be way better than this. Play the new Wolfenstein instead.			"

Not a single bit of the game was what was promised, and it wasn't nearly as good looking as the so-called gameplay trailers (that turned out to be prerendered).Moderately fun shooter?  Yes.

												A game so bad it could bring a lawsuit against the publisher and developers? Yes.However I wasnt around for the what is most common into days gaming world... a bunch of bugs and poorly rushed out games that offer and say they will shock and awe and then do a 180 and enrage and offend on release day.Aliens colonial marines had a pretty bad debut, but in the years past its now an OKAY game. There is a mod for the game called the ACM Overhaul its up to version 4.5 with a 5.0 promised sometimes soon, the mod makes the aliens harder, very hard and much harder to kill, it can upgrade this OKAY game experience to a GOOD one, by tweaking the graphics, altering the dumbfounded AI and messing around with the weapons recoil, accuracy etc.I mostly played the game without a mod and found it too be okay for an FPS game, what it really does well is tell the story of Cprl Hicks and some of the after events of the 2nd alien movie - Aliens. If you wanted to relive a movie - this is as close as you get, the people involved in this games creation did do the story justice and create the atmosphere of the Aliens movie.The FPS action was nothing special, but with the aliens sneaky rogue attacks and ability to flank and otherwise spring good surprise attacks it keeps you on edge. I found the weapons were somewhat clunky non modded, especially the two non legendary shotguns, but mostly the weapons had put down power and were fairly accurate. However using the primary fire only on these guns would be boring, some weapons offer up to 3 different alternate fire options and the options do differ enough from each other to consider for uses in strategic moments.The challenge system of this game can be staggeringly harsh, you get low kill number quest for easy things and high kill numbers for hardEST things. Like having to get 25 claymore kills - you only get 1, and finding ammo for them is rare. So you either have to keep restarting an objective over, or if your lucky to ever even play multiplayer - get 25 kills there. The challenges are not well thought out in order, so you could need to be level 20 for  the 15th challenge, or in MP you could need to grind out 4 levels on your xeno just to get the next challenge to unlock because the skill required for it is at 14, and you were at 10. I have 100% completion on this title: i had a friend who also has the game so we were able to complete the MP challenges. But if your going it solo, the Multiplayer is dead (as of 2/27/17) I have yet to actually find a game online with anyone for the entire duration I have played this game. (57 hours) Let it be known that the Kill 2 in one challenges can be completed in MP with just 2 people, the sentry turrets when deployed count as a person, so in the few kill 2 by 1 attack challenge weakening the turret and standing a marine next to it, and they both perish is considered two kills. There are many good challenge and collectible guides for ACM that will explain where it is best to grind out challenges.The final word on ACM from my experience is that if your an Aliens fan, and wanna go relive the Aliens movie, this game is really well setup to do so, if your an FPS player who likes to slay monsters and aliens there is some okay carnage to be sought here. This game was suppose to be a A++ title at release - even now its more like a B+ title. As some of the people who reviewed this game at its release, after its huge patch that fixed alot of things, and after the ACM Overhaul mod, have said - ""while the patch and the overhaul mod have helped ACM tremendously, you can only polish a turd so much.""Getting 90% achievements on this game leaving out the 5 or so MP achievements is about 4 playthroughs. If your not 60 by then, just do the final mission (Home) on the Ultimate Bad As_ difficulty - its about 2850xp for 5 min of play.Stay Frosty Marine			"

												Aliens Colonial Marines is a masterful experience, and here is why:Perfection. That is the only word for it. Aliens colonial marines is a masterpiece in every sense of the word, from the art style, to the graphic fidelity.Indescribable, that's how I would but the audio. Take the gauss rifle, or the voice acting, for example, all bring eargasm's galore.Let's talk about the game play for one salty ♥♥♥♥ing second, it's amazing 10/10. The gun play is unrivalled, no other game could ever compare to this majestic ♥♥♥♥ing artwork.Even though its god bad reviews, this is only because everyone is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ jealous. The devils at Valve have hired many individuals to negatively degrade this smegma-filled joy ride.Oh don't even get me ♥♥♥♥ing started on the level design. Take for example, the unforgettable spash-ship levels, that provide the authentic aliens experience every fan of the franchise longs for.Forget about Halo, forget about gears of war, COD, TF2, Battlefield, all of 'em. They all pale in comparison to the epic♥♥♥♥♥♥train that is Aliens colonial marines. No-body could truly comprehend how amazing this game was, so they tossed aside it brilliant story and game play in favour of these inferior games.Solid plot line, if not better. I think anyone can feel satisfactory for paying full price for this ludicrous display, and I doubt anyone can keep a straight face when trying to talk about the issues with the game.However, the game does have dlc, which further raises the price if you want the full experience, but this isn't the developers fault, this is just to capitalise on this majestic ♥♥♥♥ing experience.It's a true marvel, a wonder of the 21st century. I have never experienced such masterful perfection, never before have I adored such a game.That's all I got to say about this hidden gem of a game, but if you want my true opinion on the game, just read the first letter of each ""paragraph"".

The main theme of the story is: ""We don't leave Marines behind,"" and it will annoying to keep hearing that after awhile. Hicks' character changed drastically, it's not the same character from the movie. Even after the latest update, graphic quality is still not on par with other A-List games released on 2013. I can't imagine how bad the graphic quality was at the 1st day of release. The multiplayer is boring except the Bug Hunt, make sure you get it.CONCLUSION :Recommended on sale price.			"

												When I was 10 years old, I saw on TV news about this ""ALIENS"" movie and thought it would be something like Star Wars that I loved so much. My father, not sure why decided to take me to the movie theater without telling me absolutely nothing about the story. In Brazil, Aliens movie was rated PG13. Once the movie started and me and my sister were absolutely terrified with the fist chest burst in Ripley's nightmare, we were not prepared to later on, when all Colonial Marines were trapped with no ammo, except for Hick's shotgun, flamethrowers and two smartguns, I remember being totally scared and saw my father's amuzed grin when my sister, almost crying in fear, had asked my father to leave the movie theater.This may sound absurd right now because, Aliens are not scary anymore. And one of the reasons to make such good movies like  Alien (1978)  and Aliens (1986) feel like a bad joke is because of games like ALIENS: Colonial Marines.I was really excited when I heard about a A:CM game which would have a very minimal HUD and have very realistic scenes, just like the movies or even more. Heard that they had contracted the same artist that designed some of the movie sets. It was like a dream. I would finally experiment what was to be in a Colonial Marine shoes, struggling for my own survival.Low ammo, nowhere to run. Totally outnumbered.Movie spoiler alert, do not read if you did not watch the movie.But wait ... If I remember well, the atmosphere reactor, which is a HUGE nuclear powered structure, BLEW UP in the end of ALIENS, and the blast was so huge that the shockwave caught up the dropship they used to escape.So ... the history is already broken. But since I wanted to live the same experience in the movie, it was not too bad(Still it made no sense why would there be any xenomorphs alive, the Queen was expelled in the airlock)There are so many plot holes in this game. They even tried to come up with a explanation on how the Sulaco either never left LV-426 or came back from Fury 161(The planet of Alien3 movie).Story is bad, I can mention one guy you find cocooned in Sulaco, that really does have a sense of duty. He wishes to complete his mission to find and retrieve Sulaco's data computer (to find out what happened), he is not sure what is going on with him, but he does knows that something wrong is bound to happen. This guy is a hero, isn't he? He could have been, but instead, when you're hauling♥♥♥♥♥back to the ship, the chestburster inside him starts to rip his way out, and this wannabe hero does the most illogic thing. He pulls out a grenade inside the umbilical that serves as a connection between the two ships and blew it killing some other marines in the process.IT DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSE!!! Things start to go downhill very fast till the end, which is not a end, but may become a ""proper"" end in the DLC, which I'll be sure to never ever play.This game is absolutely different from what Gearbox showed us in ""work in progress"" in E3 and every other advertisement about A:CM. Usually when regarding WIP, we expect things to get better instead of becoming worse like it seem to have happened.Maybe if I didn't expect anything from this game, I would consider it worth of 10usd or less. But since it is a major let down, and it seems that gearbox used the budget they had for A:CM to other purposes, I WOULD NOT SPEND EVEN A PENNY ON THIS.Seriously. I sworn to never ever buy anything from Gearbox again. They will not have my money, since they don't show a single gesture of respect towards gaming community.Some folks might say ""wait, you're talking about the make of BORDERLANDS!!!"", and yep that's them. And this is no place to talk about it, but Google for ""Code Hunters"" and you will find that Gearbox have no limits in wrong doing. They do whatever the f*ck they want to earn money, even if it is illegal.Also, check out the current news for legal dispute that involves Sega and Gearbox regarding A:CMhttp://www.polygon.com/2014/9/3/6102035/sega-gearbox-lawsuit-aliens-colonial-marinesThis is shameful. Sega won't take the blame alone, as they point that Gearbox is the one who totally disgraced what was supposed to be the best game experience of Alien Franchise. Let's hope Alien Isolation fills this gap.Thanks for reading!			"

												I willingly parted with €1.47 of my hard-earned money for this game, I thought to myself, ""Hey, why not, surely at that price it'll be worth it"". I was wrong. Nothing can ever make up for this. It is the worst decision I will ever make. It felt so good for about 2 minutes as I explored the very first room I was let into. ""Wow, awesome, it's just like in Aliens"", the sounds, the sights, the setting. Then the voice acting happened. Then combat happened. Then movement happened. Then the controls happened. Not even playing this in co-op with an equally hopeful friend could make this enjoyable. This is not a game. This is not a an attempt at a game. This is the worst decision anyone has ever made in the entirety of human history. I wish I was being dramatic.			"

												Aliens Colonial Marines is a masterful experience, and here is why:Perfection. That is the only word for it. Aliens colonial marines is a masterpiece in every sense of the word, from the art style, to the graphic fidelity.Indescribable, that's how I would but the audio. Take the gauss rifle, or the voice acting, for example, all bring eargasm's galore.Let's talk about the game play for one salty ♥♥♥♥ing second, it's amazing 10/10. The gun play is unrivalled, no other game could ever compare to this majestic ♥♥♥♥ing artwork.Even though its god bad reviews, this is only because everyone is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ jealous. The devils at Valve have hired many individuals to negatively degrade this smegma-filled joy ride.Oh don't even get me ♥♥♥♥ing started on the level design. Take for example, the unforgettable spash-ship levels, that provide the authentic aliens experience every fan of the franchise longs for.Forget about Halo, forget about gears of war, COD, TF2, Battlefield, all of 'em. They all pale in comparison to the epic♥♥♥♥♥♥train that is Aliens colonial marines. No-body could truly comprehend how amazing this game was, so they tossed aside it brilliant story and game play in favour of these inferior games.Solid plot line, if not better. I think anyone can feel satisfactory for paying full price for this ludicrous display, and I doubt anyone can keep a straight face when trying to talk about the issues with the game.However, the game does have dlc, which further raises the price if you want the full experience, but this isn't the developers fault, this is just to capitalise on this majestic ♥♥♥♥ing experience.It's a true marvel, a wonder of the 21st century. I have never experienced such masterful perfection, never before have I adored such a game.That's all I got to say about this hidden gem of a game, but if you want my true opinion on the game, just read the first letter of each ""paragraph"".

												29-Feb-2016 : Finished main story Equipment : MSI GT80-2QE NotebookREVIEW :The atmosphere of the game is great, you really feel like you're in the Aliens movie, but the B-List movie version with bad storytelling and screenplay. The main theme of the story is: ""We don't leave Marines behind,"" and it will annoying to keep hearing that after awhile. Hicks' character changed drastically, it's not the same character from the movie. Even after the latest update, graphic quality is still not on par with other A-List games released on 2013. I can't imagine how bad the graphic quality was at the 1st day of release. The multiplayer is boring except the Bug Hunt, make sure you get it.CONCLUSION :Recommended on sale price.			"

												Aliens:  Colonial MarinesI purchased this a month or so back for £1.99 when HumbleBundle had it on sale, even though I was aware about all the negative and controversial stories about it.  But I like 'Aliens', and was compelled just to try it, and at that price I felt it was no risk.This isn't a terrible game, just more an average game.  However two missions within this game were actually quite fun and challenging, but the issues - which are well documented, bring the whole experience down.   I just feel a little sorry for the guys who worked on the music, sound effects and some of the level designs which are very authentic to the original 'Aliens' film.  This game unfortunately seems to have started with the best intensions, and it shows in certain parts of the game, but the final product looks rushed and indecisive.  It should have been so much better...2/5			"

So glad we at least got Alien Isolation later on to heal from those wounds. That's the way a game gets made and created. Now we need a developer to make the next FPS/RPG 4 species intense TDM dream of a game for the hardcore alien fans. Preferably a developer who gives a damn about their creation and who doesn't lie and cheat. This so called game.. 1/10Not recommended. BOYCOT GEARBOX !			"

												-dont play this on consoles, their hardware cant take the graphic enhance patches that have come out. pcs are upgradable, load faster & have superior graphics over consoles everyone knows this. the screen tearing, texture pop in & mass amount of low res textures everywhere is only on the consoles, xbox360 being the worst of the 2 for obvious reasons, if you insist on a console for this game at least use a ps3.-the dlcs for acm are good & worth getting with the season pass, its still overpriced from valve so get the season pass elsewhere for much cheaper. multiplayer is mostly dead if not completely dead now cause humans are dumb bandwagon sheep, for the slight multiplayer thats still alive if found, is enjoyable for the most part. the only advantage to consoles for this game is that their multiplayer has or had a little more than pc.-the minimum specs are wrong for the gpu, it needs to be higher than those at least geforce 9600/amd 3800 series, there is no graphic settings in game to reduce for weaker gpus, draw distance, sbao etc dont do anything, all you have to reduce load on older gpus is resolution itself. my desktop does fine maxed fps all the time, my laptop with a gt 555m native res is 1366x768 & can at best do 1600x900 on this game, 1080p is just too slow ~21 fps. cpu requirements are mostly accurate, any hyperthreaded dual core like mobile i3/i5 are fine, it just needs the threads. the i5 2410m in my laptop has power to spare in acm & most other games thats 2 cores 4 threads.-single player is good there was lots of fixes to difficulty, ai, graphics..the latest single player dlc stasis interrupted is one of the best dlc the game has. i have a play through of said dlc i did on its launch day ->

												A game sullied by its very poor quality upon release, A:CM has received a somewhat infamous reputation for being...well...rather rubbish.  That said, time has moved on and so the price has come down and patches have been released along the way.  And you know what? Its actually not that bad for a ""tenner"".At first, the companion-ai is what gets you down; My bandana-bearded chum, ""O'Neill"", has this habit of getting stuck...usually found running blindly into a wall, unable to catch up with you unless ""beaming to your location"" if you are separated by a certain distance.  He also seems to disappear ahead of you...like he is the Flash? ""Right, matey shall we go  now  - WHERES HE GONE NOW?!"" - which reminds one of the situation at the supermarket when an old dear has ""lost her husband"" for the uptenth time. Also, close combat is confusing as you either need to press ""E"" or ""V"" which becomes frustrating durning a criticial encounter with a bug - can we not just have one or the other, please?  Last and probably most dissapointing is that weapon selection doesnt seem to go beyond the third numerical key...but I think that might just be me overlooking something...The thing that won me over, was the bit where you are stripped of your weapons and you end up evading the bugs with a bit of stealth and cunning, which is admittedly basic in comparison to Alien Isolation's superior artificial intelligence, but ultimately A:CM actually delivered a genuinely scary-but-fun experience, but without punishing the player for merely laying low, for which 'Isolation was guilty as hell.  It was in this part of the game where the player gets a taste of what it was like for poor Newt, and somehow, the faults of the game become niggles as you finally accept A:CM for what it is: a blatant excuse to return to Hadley's Hope, slap a large bug around his slobby-chops with an awesome Power-Loader and give those smug Company-bums a damn good thrashing.Still rough around the edges, but with the patches and at a budget price there is some fun to be had with Colonial Marines.  Just dont pay more than £10 for it!			"

												Now, I'm going to start by stating my credentials so that people know I'm not blowing crap out my ears.I have 45 hours on this game. I have gone through the hassle, yes, hassle, not challenge, of unlocking the ""State of the Badass Art"" Achievement on this game for defeating it on the hardest difficulty level. I've even managed to play some multiplayer before it became an abandoned wasteland. I was one of the fools who preordered it and I continued playing it after the update to the graphics that finally came.That taken care of it's time for the actual review.Don't waste your money on this steaming pile of horse manure. Even if it's on sale.What we were promised as a community was bloody brilliant. It was graphical, intense, and it looked beautiful. Constant motion, brilliant graphical design, and made by companies that were well-known for good games. What we got I would've excused if it wasn't so falsely advertised and if it was made by an indie developer. Not after all the beautiful ""In-game"" footage and the screenshots and hype-building.When I first got the game I was carried by the hype and I even defended the game based off of my belief that most people disliked it purely because the motion-tracker was something you had to pick up and not something sitting in the HUD like in AVP2010.I own up to that and apologize to everyone for that. Which is more than I can say for the people responsible for the lie that is A:CM. If I could I'd refund this game and use the money on a different one but I can't.The AI is buggy and slow and unresponsive and that's just the Marines.Aliens sit out in the open practically begging to be shot.There's enough ammo and such laying about that it makes challenge a thing of the past and the fact that your sidearm has infinite ammo redundant. Not to mention you can ALWAYS switch weapons with anything you've unlocked so if you do manage to spray-and-pray your way through your Pulse Rifle then you can just open a menu and trade it for the SMG.Difficulty level is a joke. The AI doesn't get harder you just get a bit weaker and in the case of the ""Ultimate Badass"" difficulty it just means you don't have a HUD. Boss fights are hysterical and only ever difficult because of spam not actual challenge.The graphics level, compared to what we were promised, is something I'd expect from an Indie Dev, but they don't falsely advertise. The graphics are buggy and low-detail. It's almost funny in a sad way how easy it is to tell the difference between an alien and alien hive wall goop, where they should be blending perfectly. And this is all the static graphics not the motion graphics. Explosions are crap and nothing I can believe in. The characters at least don't clip into their parts like they did before the update. The ragdoll physics are.... sickening.Oh, lest I forget, you spend more time in Call of Duty style shootouts with Wey-Yu personnel than you do actually having a horror experience fighting or running from Aliens. Well done Game Devs you made another run-and-gun Shooter.I'm going to stop now and finish. Don't waste your money. Buy a good game like Isolation seems to be. Or AVP2010.			"

												I bought the Aliens Collection that comes with ACM, AvP, and all  the DLC for both games, for $30. And for that price it's pretty good. I had played it previously on Xbox 360 but only ever played the base game , so it was fun starting fresh and getting to experience Stasis Interupted which is actually pretty good. The game looks crappy, but for the price it ain't half bad. Multiplayer is a bit of an issue. You won't find many people online. When I tried searching for players I only found one. The only way you can play MP is if you find some guys on the forum. So if you buy Colonial Marines, then  friend me and we can play CoOp. But yeah, it's worth the $15.  And worth the $30 if you bought the collection.			"

												You know something strange is going on when serious reviewers on mainstream media sites sound like they're channeling Yahtzee when reviewing a game.  It's a strange case of expectation vs reality.  When a game fails to meet expectations, it gets ripped to shreds for the tiniest flaws that people would find amusing in other games and ends up with a much worse rating than a game that was expected to be bad and is an entirely worse game.By now everyone's heard the rumors about the turbulent development of this game.  It's obviously a tale of project management gone seriously wrong with the game being put on hold for years and later passed onto another studio.  The most amazing thing I've heard however is that just 9 months before release, Gearbox got the game back from Timegate, threw most of it out, and started over.  That's pretty amazing if you ask me and I doubt any other studio could pull it off.To the game itself:  The campaign is a reasonable length, pretty standard these days.  Served with a heavy dose of fan service, some people may like it more than others.  The story's more of a stretch than Alien 3, wedging itself in there in the realm of cinematic impossibility.  Voice acting's a mixed bag but the writing is terrible and there's plenty of cringe-worthy lines.  The campaign is fully coopable as well, but the coop feels a bit tacked on with a couple of noname marines tagging along with the main character, and the game teleporting people to the leader when someone walks 5 feet ahead of the group.That said, the gameplay is pretty good at least.  It's fun shooting xenos and even the Wayland-Yutani goons who come after you to cover up their horrifying experiments.  The xeno animations may be a bit wonky so they don't quite move or act like aliens should, but they'll still rip you to shreds if you aren't paying attention.  Your AI partners are pretty useless, mostly firing blanks and getting in the way (not that that's anything unusual) though some people have more trouble with this than others.Multiplayer on the other hand is a bit of a mess.  It's wildly unbalanced, with marines having a huge advantage at lower levels and being able to level up through single player and co-op.  The marines even get a fully automatic shotgun that can kill most xenos in one shot.  After the aliens level up and get certain upgrades, suddenly they can take 8 shots from the same gun without dying and dominate the marines.  The game uses peer-to-peer matchmaking so lag is always a problem and the third person control of the aliens is beyond awful.  Wallclimbing barely works and is pretty much useless except for climbing up onto high points to spit at the marines with the spitter.  Some of the modes are somewhat fun at least.I think the best way to sum up this game is to say it's disappointing.  After watching the E3 demo from a couple years ago and then playing the first level in the real game yourself, it's hard not to be mad about what the game could have been.  The graphics went from top of the line to couple-years-ago-average to work on consoles and took all the atmosphere along with it.  It makes me wonder if things might've been different if the game had come out next year targeted for the next generation of consoles.Bottom line: Disappointing but still better than Call of Duty.

												Being a huge Alien fan I was suckered into preordering this game for the xbox 360 back in the day. Everything you have probably heard about this game's quality is true. The graphics are nowhere near as stunning as they were portrayed to be in the early tech demo and the promotional screenshots (although the huge post launch patch did improve them vastly). The Alien and human AI (both your partners and enemies) gargles galactic balls, as either group often gets hung up in door ways or on props. The shooting feels very underwhelming, as most weapons lack an appopriate oomph, and aside from the pulse rifle they all are very underpowered damage wise. There is absolutely no atmosphere or tension in this game, save for one borderline genius level around a quarter of the way in. It's sad to see that a game that just came out a few years ago was unable to conjure up the same exhilaration and tension that AvP2 was able to over a decade ago. If you shop online frequently and love Aliens/tolerate or like Predator, then I highly recommend Aliens Vs. Predator 2, the game not the terrible movie. That game has a brilliant intertwining campaign told from 3 different perspectives, as well as genuine terror and tension, combined with sharp gunplay and mechanics. Very little fluff either, which Colonial Marines packs in en masse. I would avoid this game unless steeply discounted, and even then you probably will be disappointed unless you download the recent overhaul mod a dedicated fan released. Better quality work in a free mod than this corporate produced turd.			"

												To be quite honest this is not really a game, but more of a... compilation of references and homages to the movie. This relies so much on your love and nostalgic connection to the James Cameron movie that fails completely as an actual game. It's not so buggy now as it was on launch, but forget the bugs, the problems are deeper than that and are right in its structure. However I can also say that played in co-op it can be fun.2/5			"

												I recognise the build of this game, the murky graphics, DEMIURGE, the company that brought us Mass Effect 1's hand in this definitely shines through. Their influence can be seen in the graphics presentation of the game, I am sucking it up :-)ALIEN ISOLATION is coming! Being not the biggest fan of FPS (first person shooters-I prefer 3rd person gaming), I endure most FPS for story sake! I have completed here the single player story and thoroughly enjoyed it, IN ANTICIPATION OF COURSE FOR THE UPCOMING IN THE SERIES!! I was not dissappointed, on the reverse side of the coin I think my FPS abilities have breathed and shown their room for improvement. It was also appreciated knowing this game (ALIENS: COLONIAL MARINES) is an official sequel to the known films (fact)! So I absorbed what I could enjoying as much detail as I could, and also playing it through THAT looking glass! Again I played many (not all) hours of this game on my wall through a projector, THE DETAIL is out of this world!!! Try it, I am so blessed with that!  I can't say it enough! There definitely have been many published comments about the quality of this game (even a lawsuit between Gearbox & Sega), but, I am so excited with the upcoming game I was satsified enough to let it wet my appetite for more. Even thinking of replaying my AVP through! Another game that reminded me of this genre or series (Aliens) was ALIEN RAGE, a lot like this game, a worthy quench for more of this sort of thing indeed! Ok, ok, this review is slanted on the single player mode (for which I personally endure FPS-mode-games), there is also a multiplayer mode with DLC and maps for that. If that's your thing you'LL find it in this game too! PEOPLE GET READY!!  :-)			"

												The problem with a great deal of negative press surrounding a title such as this is I almost decided to pass on getting it 2 years after release at a price of under $4.00. I'm very glad I did get it, because as a fan of the original films A:CM says ""you're a marine, here's your hardware, and btw - none of that 'hold your fire' bs the original squad had to deal with."" Weapons free - time for a bug hunt! You've got all the tools of the trade: pulse rifle, shotguns, pistols, flamethrowers, and yes, the famed smart gun. Everyone's heard the negatives - it was too expensive and buggy as hell... well I played through the campaign with a full four-marine squad of friends and family and had a blast. Apparently its been patched up enough to be playable. Sure, I'd have loved for it to have decent graphics and writing but that doesn't make this a bad game. Re: gameplay, the aliens sometimes sneak up on you by moving silently and other times attack head on. I'd have preferred better use of acid to up the danger levels of interacting with the beasts. The human enemies were rather boring placeholders for ""non-alien enemy x"" but whatever. Perusing the DLC I decided to skip everything except for the ""Stasis Interrupted"" campaign pack, which also allows for co-op with a prequel to the main story involving an assortment of survivors and good old Cpl Hicks. TL;DR Being familiar with the films probably would aid your appreciation of the game. In the end its about being a US Colonial Marine and hunting bugs. Get some!			"

HIGHLY RECOMMEND.Recommended. On the fence. Play it when hell freezes over. Avoid like the plague. It's honestly not that bad BUT there is a fair share of problems: -Low resolution textures from 2006 with a crappy grainy filter -Non existent special effects (e.g. explosions)-Awkward animations-Budget voice actors -Incoherent plot -Questionable AI. Impressed me at times by hiding or running away. Other times they froze up and stood still. -There's no balance in difficulty. On normal, some of the human enemies can kill you in 2-3 hits in half a second.-Gearbox dropped support for this game immediately (SHAME ON YOU). This includes multiplayer support and SHIFT codes. (As of October 4, 2014 - the latest patch has yet to fix any of problems.)If you think this won't bother you, then I recommend it. There is decent core gameplay and they also managed to tap into some of the nostalgia from the movie. Otherwise try the 2010 remake of Alien vs Predator or Alien: Isolation and forget this game ever existed. I personally would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy a few segments. They did put a smile on my face. Unfortunately the game had unparallel hype and failed to live up to any of it. I went in expecting nothing and came out neutral. As of right now, I'd give it a 6/10  - an average game with technical difficulties but set in an incredible universe. A mod could easily fix most of the problems and alter the score to an 8/10 but that's hoping for too much. That being said, it's not the worst thing ever so don't be fooled by the negative reviews - I've played a bunch of crappy games in my day but this isn't one of them. Strictly generic with technical problems.			"

												Single player is horrible. Alien and marine Ai was horrendous before the patch, to put it mildly. Game has been falsely advertised and the quality of the final product (compared to the demo), is horrible. But where the game really shines is its multiplayer. While not without some unfixed bugs and glitches, it is a load of fun to play against other players.

												Whilst the game could've been better it is in no way a 'terrible' game, sure it's bad (from what it started as) but it's not the worst. I actually find it fun and entertaining.Alright, so I have this game on ps3; beat it with my twin a while back (a year or something ago) and I remember that the game had issues: bad AI, low frame rates and delayed controls from what it seemed. So I saw this on sale for PC and I was like 'hey, why not, $1.99 isn't that bad' and I also heard that the PC version was patched quite alot. I booted up the game played through the campaign and I must say I am impressed, the frame rate was descent, the game looks better (slightly) and the AI descent. If your an Aliens fan, give it a chance, especially when it's on sale.Co-op is pretty fun too.			"

												So this game received a lot of flak when it came out. In this review, I have to admit that I didn't follow the progress, I wasn't familiar with the E3 footage, and I didn't play through this game until November 4th - 6th, 2014; well after it was released and patched up.It's not a bad game by any means. The graphics are good, though a lot of the textures (particularly monitor screens) seem really low resolution. I'm not a big fan of the ""constant AI companion"" model, but it suits the movie, and I thought it was interesting that games are finally achieving what ""Daikatana"" was supposed to do.I liked the environments and the general story (some of the dialogue sucks, though the actors are doing their best with it). The challenge level was about right for me.I remember a lot of people complained about the ""blind aliens"" level. I thought it was an okay part of the game. They're not just randomly blind and stupid- they're basically ""damaged"" by radiation. It's a gimmick that serves gameplay rather than story, but nothing too bad. A lot of the aliens did attack with the ""walking approach for a hug"" move, but again, it didn't ruin the experience too much for me.Big pros; I think fighting alongside Hicks is real childhood wish fulfillment for people who grew up with the movie. It was great to see his character come back and kick♥♥♥♥♥ and I'm grateful to Michael Biehn for reprising the role (even though he said it was a miserable experience).Was it worth the prepurchase price I paid for the game? I am not sure. I think it's definitely worth $14.99 to any fan of the Aliens movies though. Maybe this game fell flat as a first person shooter to a lot of people, but I think it does a pretty good job of creating a cinematic experience for a player to enjoy for a few hours.			"

												Another example of the Alien franchise going in the wrong direction, as the once survival horror franchise takes another step closer to being a modern military shooter. There is little this game has to offer besides generic linear shooting, short campaign and gives off all the signs of a rushed incomplete product. While there are few moments that give off the Alien horror feel and tension, they are short lived and you  soon find yourself fighting against and alongside awful AI again.The single player campaign simply emphasizes the numerous issues within the game. As well as soon questioning which product you bought. After the first level of killing aliens you will soon find yourself fighting mercenaries for at least fifty percent of the game or more. The game offers no originality or twists to combat while still finding it almost impossible to match up to even some of the most basic shooters on the market. There is a scene in which the game takes a stealthy horror approach however this very short experience is soon over before you find yourself back in the same combat situations you have been for the past two to three hours. Many aspects of the game offer the accuracy of detail for the Alien franchise such as accurate pulse rifle sounds and map design that respects the original designs from the Alien films. Other areas simply express the laziness of the development team as the iconic smartgun simply has the identical sound of the pulse rifle, which as many Alien fans will know do not sound the same.The voice acting and storyline are both very poor, with voices just sounding unconvincing and out of place , while laughable dialog just makes cut scenes a painful chore to watch. Many times during the dialog the characters lips will become completely out of synchronization with the voice over. Characters will also often seem very stiff and lack animations, and at some points they will simply skip an animation which has just clearly just not being put into the game. One boss simple does not even have any attack animations, it simply walks around in circles and if it touches you, you find yourself on the floor for no reason missing a health bar.The poor voice acting and animations make it difficult to take characters seriously or develop any bond to them, this is made even worse by the awful artificial intelligence of your team. You will often find your team shooting the walls, standing still or walking around in circles very confused during combat, it would have been much better if they simply removed the teammates from the game completely. If you were left alone instead of frequently listening to O’niels bad dialogue, it would greatly improve the experience. The enemy AI does little to inspire as well, as many aliens will simply slowly walk up you in the open and never use speed or wall running to help them, while bosses simply spend more time struggling to navigate the terrain.If you are playing this, I would suggest co-op instead of single player, this by far improves the gameplay when you bring friends along. As more players join the game, the number of aliens and health of enemies increases to try to balance the game, however some areas especially against enemy infantry or not scaled. This often leaves situations such as four players walking through narrow corridors and killing two or three poorly armed scientists in each room and many players having nothing to do for around half an hour. There is no class system in co-op but simply an increased number of players, an area that the game could have looked at to improve the co-op teamwork involved.Multiplayer seems to have the most work put into it, with many customization upgrades for not only the marines but also for the aliens. It also offers more variety then the older Alien games with multiplayer, with new classes for the aliens to use in more effective ways such as a spitter or crusher aliens. It can be frustrating at times, as the aliens seem to have such little health issues with lag and controls means you may often die and be confused of what happened and why. Playing as the marines adds much more tension then the single player campaign has to offer. The motion sensor has use and often fuels the paranoia for the marine team trying to stay alive. These tense and exciting moments can soon be lost however, when you find aliens lagging then suddenly you are on the floor dead and the poor and sometimes none existent animations make this even more confusing. The multiplayer will unlikely have a long life, with many upgrades available within one or two days of playing multiplayer will soon lose interest to the majority of players with the lack of content.With a season pass DLC already available on the steam store for 30$, for future DLC, I question how they feel its appropriate to charge for more content for this game while its clearly unfinished and lacking content in the main game. With many people disappointed with the DLC released for borderlands 2 made by Gearbox, I have little hope that we will be impressed and find our moneys worth within future DLC content. Personally I feel that the future DLC should be free, considering how much content that was promised before release simple is not there, but that isn’t how business works.Pro:Most areas live up to the lore of AliensFour player drop in/out co-opMultiplayer that can sometimes provide the paranoia fueling Alien experienceSmall customization features and upgradesCons:Poor dialogue and voice actingPoor animations, sometimes none existentPoor visualsNo real boss fightsDreadful enemy and team AIGeneric combat that struggles to meet up to even the most basic shootersLack of class system for co-opNo re-playability for the campaignMultiplayer can be fun, but has little to offer in the long termMy verdict is that you should avoid this game under all circumstances. There is little to be gained to playing this poorly executed shooter, while it may appeal to some of the Alien fans, and those into modern military shooters, it still is poor in every single aspect. Simply put, everything this game tries to do, other games do better as it just feels terribly outdated and unfinished. If you really want to purchase this product still, I would advise waiting a few months for a sale or the price to drop, I can’t imagine it will retain full price for very long.			"

												This game doesn't deserve all the negativity it gets. I played it originally on console when it first came out so I've seen this game in it's worst form. Then when I eventually got it again on Steam I looked up some tweaking to improve A.I. and it made all the difference. On console the xenos would just run towards you with open arms, accepting their fate, but on pc they were on the walls, sneaking behind, lunging from all over. Pros:- You get to play as a Colonial Marine. (M41-A Pulse Rifle...need I say more?)- You get to visit the Sulaco.- You get to visit LV-426 and view areas in the movie where our characters took their last stand. (Even the floor was damaged where Hudson was pulled under)- Legendary weapons for fanboys to get excited over.- Everything from the atmosphere, music, and sound effects are spot on. Cons:- It was not the Alien game we were all hoping for.- A.I. by default isn't the best (nor the worst) but that can be fixed with mods/patches.- Ending felt rushed.Being  a fan of the series I would say this game is worth a try. It goes on sale quite often and if you can pick it up with a friend it's a good co-op play session.As a game (co-op): 7 / 10 As for the nostalgia: 10 / 10			"

												In the current state  this game isnt as bad as it's reputation might suggest.It was even fun to play.Over the last 2 decades of my pc-gaming life, i saw and played all Alien-related 1st person games (like AVP2000, AVP2, Alien isolation, etc) so i am able to judge if it's a worthy buy as an alien fan.And it really is.It's fun to play on LV-426, to fight alongside your (dumb) teammates and hear the famous weapon sounds.Also you can find legendary weapons (based on the film Aliens) and some audio logs.Personally i see it as a Call of Duty in the alien universe. And tbh all modern Call of Duties bored me way more than this game did in the 8 hours i needed to complete it.So for my final words i can honestly say that this game is worth to purchase when you see it for 5 euros or less.

												Aliens: Colonial Marines was conceived with access to some of the film’s original creators and even designated to be official canon by the corporate stewards of the franchise. It has “legit” written all over it, but while there’s ample gore, acid blood, and the persistent modulating whine of marine pulse rifles, film’s nerve-wracking tension just isn’t there. For all the attention paid to the source material, it just doesn’t feel like Aliens.The best way to describe the gameplay is merely “standard.” The shooting is what you would come to expect from Call of Duty: aiming down the sights of a gun, shooting enemies and throwing grenades. It’s all there and never really feels different from any other shooter. Players will be pitted against both Xenomorphs and human mercenaries. The story falls short throughout the campaign. The voice acting consists of poorly written dialog and uninspired performances. The final payoff to the entire game is underwhelming, and questions are never really answered. It got to a point where I just tuned the story bits out.The lighting effects and visuals do look good in some areas. The animations, on the other hand, are very clunky. The enemy AI is just plain bad in many cases. Of course, that doesn’t stop them from being deadly. The multiplayer has different modes that put two teams against each other.Most players would think it would be more enjoyable to play the Aliens, but the Xenos are a clunky mess. Aliens: Colonial Marines is a mixed bag.It seems to have the right set up for a decent Aliens game with the presentation and look, but due to the boring story and clunky enemy AI, there is no tension or exciting action. The co-op is probably the best way to play, but players need to choose a higher difficulty if they want any kind of a challenge. The competitive multiplayer feels unbalanced.Aliens: Colonial Marines is so riddled with problems and boring stretches that it can be painful at times.I would only recommend this game to hardcore Alien fans.Overall 5/10.

												Terrible letdown of a game.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS AWFUL TURD OF SOFTWARE!Poor enemy AI, uninteresting gameplay.  The graphics are dated by about a decade: do not be fooled by Gearbox's Demo preview from 2012.Multiplayer is no good either. - Inability to mute people once the game begins - No dedicated servers: very high latency, long wait to get into games.  If the host leaves, the game dies (and you lose all your progress).  Although i haven't seen any yet, hacing will be rampant in short order since SEGA appears to have abandoned the game at release anyways.- It appears to have a co-op, but requires you to play with 4 people, no less.

												Puh, rating Aliens Colonial Marines is not so easy. Many things seem to disappoint, yet the atmosphere kept me playing it till the end.The Graphics of the game are okay, not really bad, but also not really beautiful. But in comparison to Graphics of the demo and the gameplay material which the producers published before the release it is quite disappointing. You can clearly see the downgrade. The Campaign is only about 6 hours long, at least I finished the game so fast and I didn't rush any parts of the game. I even died a couple of times because I stupidly thought the AI colleagues would be supporting me. So the AI is not your friend, but you have at least the possibility to play the whole campaign in Coop. I only did this for a short while, but I got the impression it is a lot more fun than alone. There are also Multiplayer Versus Modi, but you need to make an appointment with some players, because otherwise Multiplayer is practically dead. Some other flaws were annoying clipping errors and a couple of bugs both inside and outside the game. At least the one outside the game (After you finish an endless loop of restarting the game is beginning) you can fix easily by activating the ""run as administrator"" mode. The point where you have to give the game credit is capturing the atmosphere of the second alien movie. You visit a couple of familiar places and that Bishop and Hicks return in the game is a nice addition. The gameplay mainly plays like a standard shooter, so you rarely have any feeling like a horror movie. The Action is fun and you can enjoy the gameplay, but there are also couple of better games in this area.   Pro:-Alien atmosphere-More fun in CoopContra:-Graphics downgrade-Mostly stupid AI-Clipping Errors and Bugs(-Too Short campaign ?)Result: Colonial Marines is not a really bad game, but also far away from being really good. If you just want a good Alien- or a good Horror-game I can strongly suggest Alien Isolation, it is really great and in nearly all regards way better than Colonial Marines. And if you just want a good shooter, there are many better ones. So I am not really sure who this game is for. As an fan of the movies I had some fun with it, but the downsides were pretty heavy. So my final score is maybe a bit too optimistic, but I cannot recommend this game generally for players. 5/10 "

												So, WOW. What can I say about this game? Dear lord. What an experience. What an experience!Basically, if you came to see 'Aliens: The Movie: The Game' then you probably came to the right place. Sort of. Except not really. Honestly, where Aliens was smart (and it wasn't even that smart), Colonial Marines is dumb, where Aliens built tension, this game just says ""OKAY ROOM CLEAR MOVE ONTO THE NEXT ROOM WHERE YOU KILL GUYS"", where Aliens had a deliciously well-written story and characters, this game has none of that.Yeah, I guess, I mean, at least there's the nostalgia trip! On occasion! Like three times total! Did you wanna see the space jockey? Well you damn well will (albeit with some certain qualities missing)! Did you wanna see Hadley's Hope after the fact? Well, you'll see that too! Sort of! Some of it! Yeah. That's pretty much it. And you know what, Hicks and Bishop are both in this game, which is awesome, excepting the fact that you're going to have to suffer through about 80% of the game just to get here.So you know what, whereas I actually started off by thinking this game isn't so bad, hey I might even recommend it, I'm sorry, the majority of the game is just so bad that I'm afraid I can't. I don't really know how to describe it, because literally everything just feels rushed and low quality - if you really want a good Alien game, I can recommend Aliens vs Predator (2010), it's an infinitely better polished game.I mean, this game, Colonial Marines was just rushed out the door way, way too fast, it just simply wasn't ready to be released in 2013, and the publishers or whoever was at the top clearly didn't notice this, or care. So, sadly I can't recommend this. It's just not fun.			"

In fact it's a bad game, old, buggy, boring, sometimes very frustrating but you still give it a chanse, 'coz it's an alien game. Sulaco's design, marines, familiar location, it's all like in the movie besides it doesn't have any atmosphere. And that's why it is so bad. Yeah sometimes the game was really close to Aliens, but still there are so many terrible missions with stupid humans and ugly story. It's sad.BTW, tried the multiplayer and may be it's good, but my session was terrible =)			"

It seems this game is somehow even worse than the terribad Aliens vs. Predator game realeased several years ago. Hell, that game even has better graphics.

												Putting all the controversy about how this game was produced aside, this game has some good and some bad points.The games combat is simple, since it's basically a run-n-gun game. However, you'd expect there to be a cover system of some kind... there isn't. Your AI allies and the enemies will use cover like in CoD or Mass Effect, but you can only crouch behind things for cover, which is ineffective to say the least. Also, while you'd expect there to be limited ammo for any kind of weapon, the only really limited ammo is for the alt-fire weapons, as you barely run across any, sometimes going an entire mission w/o finding any. Also, you have constant access to EVERY weapon you've found/unlocked (not to mention wahtever addons/upgrades you've gotten), and can swap them out at any time during a mission, which, to me, makes no sense. Had they made it so that you only carried 3 weapons and a grenade, but could only swap them out and change their upgrades at the start/end of each mission, that would have been better.Now, may have said that the AI has been fixed, and to a degree it has, but it can still act funny at times. However, every games AI has moments like that, so you can't really fault it as much as you could before. The only gripe is how some Xeno's behave, only one type behaves like you'd expect, hiding, striking and then running off to hide again.I'd heard there were graphics problems, but honestly, when I played a friends copy back when this game was released, I didn't really notice any. So whether or not the huge 5gb ""patch"" fixed them as people claim is something I can't confirm or disprove.As far as the game's atmosphere goes, for the most part it does capture the Aliens world. When run at the suggested brightness, it's hard to make out much that isn't either already lighted, really close to you, or lighted by your flashlight (which has a very limited range. Emphisis on VERY). So most Xeno's will blend in quite well. One the other hand, instead of the tight, confiend quarters of the films, you have far more open spaces here, which can kill the overall feeling of fear as you have to run across open spaces to get from point A to point B. One of the major good points for this game is that, despite all the initial bad press, there is still a decent multiplayer community here on Steam for this game. Also, the Co-Op is fun; grab a few friends and have a blast playing the story missions or just go multiplayer and kills Xenos (or Marines if you prefer). Now, with all that said, the current non-sale price of $20 is still kind of high, given that this game is nowhere near what most people expected it to be. If you can catch it on sale for 50-75% off, don't be afraid to pick it up (and maybe the Season Pass, too).			"

												Steam finally allows users to have negative review on games. It is much better than before. I don't want to review this game at all. It is the GOTY, Garbage of The Year. The size of this game was 6GB when it was out. Then Gearbox released 2 patches about 11GB in total. This sounds crazy but it just happened. However, it was just polishing a turd. I know it was on sale for 5 bucks,well, I would say it is not worth over 7 bucks, but for 5 bucks, you could give it a try. At last, aliens movie deserves a video game with better graphics, better AI, better story, and better sound effects, not this turd.			"

												This game was horrible. Buggy AI, nerfed guns, and absolutely nothing like the trailers you may have seen three or four years ago. Co-op is even worse than single player, with glitchy pathing and net code. Multiplayer is pretty much dead. Steer clear of it, even if it goes on sale.Having been Mplayers King Of the Kill for three years in AVP Gold in the 90's, this entire game was such an immense let down for me, that I struggled to find any redeeming quality to it. I found none.			"

												Aliens: Colonial Marines should not exist, not in the state it was released. Hell, it shouldn’t even exist in the state it is now, after tons of patches. It fails in pretty much every conceivable way. Though it’s possible for die-hard fans of Aliens and Bill Pullman’s continuous whining to have a bit of fun when playing with a few buddies - together mocking the game’s serious flaws and overall mediocrity - obviously that is not the mark of a good game. Especially not when it is sold at the same price point as other full-priced games, great games that deserve your attention and money, but may get overlooked because you chose to go with brand recognition.2/5Read more:http://pixeljudge.com/en/reviews/aliens-colonial-marines-1/ "

												I removed my recommendation for this game.  All in all, I'm not filled with rage over this release the way some people are.  I like the graphics, I've had fun with the gameplay co-op with my fearless forever adventure buddy.  I'm glad I got it, I'm glad we're playing it.  But this game could have been a LOT better, and should have been.  For such a long wait, they owed us a far better story with much more attention to detail.  The shortcuts taken in this game are unforgivable for such a major title.  Aliens: Colonial Marines should not be applauded, nor the studio rewarded for their effort.  I actually wish I'd pirated this game instead of paying for it.  I pre-ordered this game after seeing E3 ""in-game footage"" that later turned out to be a complete fabrication, and nothing like the finished product.  This represents dishonesty on the part of the publisher, and many of the publishers involved here have earned a black mark in their reputation from me.I will NOT be buying Borderlands 2, because credible scuttlebutt indicates that Aliens got shortchanged in development due to focus on BL2.  I vote with my dollars, and I will be quite wary of future offerings from Gearbox - if I buy any at all.			"

												Wouldn't be shocked if Gearbox gets sued for this mess. Dated gameplay and graphics, little tension, funky AI and a script that feels like it's missing a few pages. That said, the game is actually still kinda enjoyable in 3Dvision (get the Helix mod for it) as the engine has a fair amount of depth. Doesn't make up for all the flaws, but does maybe make it worth a look for $5 during a Steam sale if you have a 3D setup. Don't even bother for 2D, at any price.			"

It is very frustrating but you feel like you have actually accomplished something when you finish the missions. I would recommend it to people that like playing really hard games (turn the corner and die)			"

												//The following is multiple excerpts from a journal recorded by a lost Marine on the VLV Steam spacecraft, only recently discovered on a backlog cleaning. Viewer discretion is advised.\\AUG 30th, 2013: Wow! Colonial Marines is 75% off! I know how much hate it's received, but.. I gotta see this for myself.AUG 31st, 2013: The multiplayer is decent. Not anything special, but it's fun. Different alien classes, different weapons and tactics for the marines.. frequent level-ups and weapon attachments to unlock. Not that bad at all, and I've only touched team deathmatch.OCTOBER 5th, 2013: I finally... I finally jumped into the single player. I don't know the time. How could I? After playing this game, it's amazing that I still have my sanity intact. Only 30 minutes played, but that was... that was a challenge I wasn't expecting.It all started fine, man! Sure, the graphics weren't great, but it was a cool start. Just walking down that space hallway, then it happened. I found that guy, wrapped up in some weird organic mush on the walls. I started to pry him off.. and an alien jumped me! It freaked me out.But that wasn't the problem. It.. it ran away. My motion tracker told me it was around the corner, but I couldn't see anything! I reloaded my gun and carefully tip-toed down the hall.. AND THERE IT WAS MAN! JUST SITTING THERE FACING THE OPPOSITE WALL! I screamed and threw my controller down, running out of the room in a panic-- if the very first alien had AI as awful as this, what did that mean for the rest of the game!?OCTOBER 6th: I tried again. I killed the beast and continued playing. We got to the hangar and that was a pretty cool scene. Marines yelling and having to defend the doo--oh.. that.. alien... oh, oh God. The animation on it locked up! IT SLID RIGHT AT ME THROUGH THE OBSTACLES IN THE MAP! OH GOD, OH GOD NO HELP ME JESU-- //transmission lost//NOVEMBER 1ST: ABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORT			"

												First of all, I just have to say this, Alien Colonial Marines is not the bad game most meta critics talk about. Aliens Colonial Marines' actually a very good and solid game.Another important aspect about the negative reviews is that most if not all are written for the console version of Aliens: Colonial Marines. The PC version is on all fronts way better. (Graphics are much better, no bugs, and solid fast controls)And just to make a stand here. The gameplay and missions is the way it should be. We're taling about Aliens (Not Alien); so that means the 2nd movie and more precise: Colonial Marines. Intergalactic Warriors. They fight, they kill and they die. And they do that a lot. And that's what you get with this game. It's based upon Aliens and the Colonial Marines in an all out war for survival. You don't need to fear, because you got hightech weapons and you ain't got time to bleed.Graphics:The graphics are far more than adequate, they're close to, if not already, top nodge.Sound:The music is just the way it should be..Alien..a bit creepy, but cool. Nothing wrong with that. The weapons and other sound effects are just fine and help a lot to immerse the player.Gameplay:Ha, yea, well, that's a different thing. The controls are perfect, everything works the way it should. No problems there. But..game falls with the quality of your gaming buddies.Aliens Colonial Marines provides a full Co-Op campaign (Even 2 with the dlc) But, the way you enjoy the campaign or the Co-Op Bug Hunt maps all comes down to your buddies.Are your buddies egocentric teenagers? Please, play solo, you'll have a better experience with the A.I. than with them.If you and your buddies can't get that special Alien feeling because you know jack sh*t about the lore, then the game fails.Combat isn't really that hard during the campaigns, which isn't bad,because it allows you to enjoy the story in full length and talk about it with your friends. (Or joke about). Me and my crew enjoyed the campaigns and we played it more than ones, just for the fun of it.Okay, now the most interesting part..Bug Hunt. Yes, I know, been there, done that, lame... NOT. Not with this game. Bug Hunt  makes you work together, because on your own you're nothing but prey, the next snack for your xenomorph friends.By killing you earn credits. With creadits you stock up on different types of ammo and or weapons and armor. Not to forget first aid. I think I've put 15+ hours or so in Bug Hunt alone, so that makes me a nut or just a prove of concept concerning this game mode.Besides just playing away you're also able to modify your weapons, look and voice. Depending on what and how many dlc's you've got for this game.Still, if you're not sure if this game is good enough for you you should think about the following. This game has been designed by the people behind borderlands. A top nodge FPS Co-Op RPG. Now translate that over to Aliens Colonial Marines, without that many role playing parameters ""et voilá"". That gives you a good picture of what you get by buying this game.			"

												Screen tearing, time waisting tutorials and over scripted scenes. a call of duty FPS with a paintjob, thanks for screwing up another favourite of mine gearbox software. Aliens was meant to be scary, the aliens are meant to hunt from the shadows, picking off soldiers one by one, not like this game. In this game they charge at you like some japanese banzai from world at war. and thats not because of the the ridiculous action sequences when the ailens get too close and pin you to the floor. I paid £2 for this and I would ask for my money Back. I spent more time redeeming codes than playing the actual game.			"

												As much as I would love to recommend this game to aliens fans I just can't. I can't say its not fun, because it really is with friends, but solo, hell no. The animations on the aliens are not clean at all, it looks like the aliens twitch around when trying to run at you. Their spots are also all pre-determined and the AI is braindead which makes hitting the aliens very easy. The AI for friendly marines are also broken and un-needed in my opinion. I witnessed one of the friendly marines literally back track 2 rooms back after we cleared the current room. This game had so much potential, and it seems all that potential went to wiping their asses with the Aliens game manual, throwing it into the toilet and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥all over it.

Shooting aliens is really fun, reccommended to fans only, the ending is worse than mass effect 3 but there are flashes of brilliance, just try it at 5-10 dollars but NOT AT FULL PRICE!!!			"

I figured that maybe the bad rep the game gets is undeserved, but no: the combat is an abomination of a Call of Duty clone (right down to fighting generic Weyland ""terrorists""), the story falls flatter than old soda, and the classic Aliens charm is ultimately wasted. It's so bad that even the last Aliens game (Aliens Vs Predator) was better.The only way I'd recommend this game is if you're intending to play it just to see how bad it is.			"

I liked this game because it was an ""Aliens"" game, and as a fan of Alien, that's why I bought the game (I actually have the collcetors edition). If you're a diehard Alien fan, you'll smile a few times throughout this game. You'll love the sound of your M41, you'll get excited the first time you climb into a Loader, and you'll squeel when you see some of Alien's iconic scenes recreated for you to fight in.Now, is it *good*? No, not at all. The sounds were glitchy, the graphics were sub par, and the story was pretty dumb. If this game went on sale for $5, I'd recommend it, but not for any more money than that.

I am enjoying the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the co-op and the multiplayer so far, it has a bit of left 4 dead to it in some of the modes.  The game is not perfect however, and at the tim eof writing this (release day.) it's in need of some definite patching, but it's not game breaking, it isn't on the level of Skyrims backward flying dragons, or Fallout New Vegas' and its multitude of crazy bugs.  Ignore the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ metacritic its unreliable anyways, and just try it out for yourself. If you can get it on the cheap (I got it for 32 bucks.) it's worth the asking price for a fan of the Aliens film/franchise.			"

Im a big fan of the movie Alien 2 so when I saw it on sale on steam for 4.99 I was like ok what the heck Ill try it out.  DONT TRUST THE REVIEWS!  If you like first person shooters and you like the movie Alien 2 you will like this game.  It is fun the graphics good and you feel like you are a Marine from the movie.  I didnt notice any bugs, the only thing I can say bad is that the human AI were kind of dumb and easy to kill but I was playing on the easiest mode and the only other thing is that my team mates would get in front of me when shooting at stuff, it freaked me out at first but then didnt bother me when I realized I could not hurt them and I could still see and hit my targets.  So dont trust the reviews on this game it is not bad at all.  I took some screen shots so check them out, that is actual gameplay using a nvidia 660 ti oc.			"

												Almost 4 years later I decided to try out the game again and see if maybe it wasn't as bad as I remember.I was wrong, I was so wrong, it's somehow WORSE than I remember.The graphics are terrible, like REALLY bad, the textures are muddier and the AA is somehow even more disgusting than I remembered it being. I seriously sat for 3 whole minutes waiting for the textures to finish loading before I realized that this is as good as it's going to get.The story is just bad fanfiction; this isn't even with respect to the Alien franchise, even as a standalone experience this is just bad. Half-baked romantic plot between two NPCs that I couldn't feel more apathetic about, lots of people talking and 'stuff' going on even thought for the most part it always feels like nothing is actually happening, and for some reason the devs felt the constant need to drop in easter eggs everywhere in the place of actually having any original plot; instead we get ""Hey remember when this happened in the movie! That was cool huh!"" every 20 or so minutes. If that wasn't bad enough the ending basically is nonexistent, all this ""stuff"" we've been doing that didn't really go anywhere and then all we get is an ""ok it's over now"", I half expected ""You're Winner!"" to pop up on the screen.The gameplay is basically just your crappy modern shooter with aliens thrown into the mix, literally. You get shot at by dudes, aliens who act like dudes without guns run at you arms spread wide for a hug only to be mowed down so that the dudes can continue shooting at you while you shoot back with weapons that feel unsatisfying and underpowered.I think everyone gets one of these kind of games eventually, the kinds that makes you stop pre-ordering games forever and turn into a huge critic for every purchase you make. This was definitely that game for me, I haven't pre-ordered a game since and I do not plan to for....well...the rest of eternity sounds nice. The blatant bait and switch that went down with this title has pretty much ruined that concept for me, great job there Sega, I'm sure that's a super sustainable business model.Either way I honestly wouldn't pay any amount of money for this game and would probably have to seriously contemplate over the idea of getting it free, so just don't bother it seriously is not worth it, I still regret buying it myself after almost 4 years and I often contemplate getting steam support to remove it from my library just so I don't have to think about it anymore. I'm honestly surprised that it's still on Steam at all, I guess Sega has to get their money back from that lawsuit somehow, that's probably why there is so much overpriced DLC.TL;DR: Go look at Alien: Isolation if you want an Alien game. Alot like the 4th movie, lets just forget that this one exists.			"

												I'm not angry at the game, I'm just disappointed.It's a big budget title from a competent game developer but it feels like a very very indie production.The story is forgettable without highpoints and surprises (including some plotholes and movie retconning for ""Aliens"" and ""Alien 3""), the overall visual quality is lacking, the music feels bland, the nostalgia-moments from the movie feel hastily placed and fail to impress. It's like a giant arrow pointing at former glory while someone shouts at you: ""Remember this from the movies? Isn't this the best game ever?"".The sound effects (mainly gun sounds and alien noises) are good, the voice acting on some parts is ok. Michael Biehn and Lance Henriksen sound bored and/or annoyed most of the time, the other voice talents are ok/good.For the gameplay: It's a shooter, plain and simple, you run along the given corridor, press a bunch of buttons and shoot aliens and corporate mercs complete with a progression system which unlocks new guns and gun decals. The pacing is somewhat slower than for example ""Call of Duty"" which is not a bad idea.Sadly, the level design are very generic and the scripted events fall flat for most parts.The weapons are ok, there aren't just that many (assault rifles, shotguns, machine pistols, occasionally flamethrower and smartgun). For more nostalgia they added 6 ""legendary"" movie weapons which can be collected and differ slightly from the standard ones. It is almost infuriating that the coolest weapons are DLC but then again the extra guns aren't needed for anything other than some variety in shooting.As enemies there are the mentioned aliens and mercs: 2 types of mercs (standard and heavy) and 3 types of aliens (including facehuggers). There are some more alien races which are only used as bosses, so they don't really count.The general lack of variety of enemies wouldn't be so bad if the A.I. behind them was any good.Mercs run for cover and shoot back at you. That's it. Aliens fall from the ceiling and run at you from all directions to claw you. Sometimes they run around in stupid circles. That's it.The only reason why these enemies pose even a slight threat are there numbers. When one alien falls from the ceiling, 3 to 5 fall down behind it. Go around 2 corners and repeat until the end of the level. It feels like design from a very very old shooter. There is no suspense or horror, especially since the first alien gets introduced after 3 minutes.Lastly the DLC, mainly ""Stasis Interrupted"": More of the same ""gameplay"" like the main game minus the progression system.It may be fun as a co-op experience. But then you would have to buy the game twice which I cannot recommend.If you are looking for original ""Alien"" feel, play ""Alien: Isolation"" instead - it has its flaws but it's very atmospheric.If you are looking for the best shooter + ""Alien"" combo, play ""Aliens vs. Predator 2"", it's still the best.

												Insultingly bad, not just as a game but also as an entry in the aliens franchise. Feels scripted from start to finish with a story that takes a dump all over the films canon. Avoid and never look back, buy alien isolation instead.			"

												This game is great and idky most of you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s thinks it's bad. It's a great game and it's something different. You can be on a space ship and go on the planet. You can be 3 different types of aliens and you can pick out which abilities. It's better than Alien vs Predator because you can be a female on this game and got 4 player co-op. So, it's better than some games that you can't do half of the stuff.			"

												I picked up Aliens: Colonial Marines for a couple dollars when it was on sale, I’m pretty big fan of the movies and I enjoyed 2010’s Alien Vs. Predator, so I thought, “Why the hell not?” I started it up and since then, I’ve really enjoyed it. I was then very shocked to see all the negative reviews for this game, because it really doesn’t deserve them. Many people complain about the poor story, and no it’s not an extremely rich and exciting story, but it’s a fairly decent at least. And plus, you don’t play an Alien game for the story. Others complain about the poor dialogue and voice acting, again it’s not Oscar-worthy, no, but it’s not anything to hate the game over. Another thing that some mention is the lack of horror. Aliens: Colonial Marines is capturing the feel of the movie Aliens, and the movie itself focuses on the action portion more than the horror aspect, so you shouldn’t be surprised to see more action than horror in a game based on an action movie.Aliens: Colonial Marines is an entertaining shooter game with a decent story, a good action element while still implementing some feel of horror. For the most part you are lurking around tight corridors and close quarters with Xenomorphs hiding in the shadows, waiting to strike. Just how an Alien game should be. And it just gets better if you add in some of your pals to fight alongside you. You can unlock and customize weapons such as a Pulse Rifle, Pump Shotgun, Battle Rifle, and more. You can use these guns in both Co-op/Solo campaign and online multiplayer. The game also has some references to the movie, such as finding Newt’s doll, finding and using Hudson’s Pulse Rifle, and few others. If you feel like you’ve gotten everything you’re going to get out of the game, check out some DLC’s. I strongly recommend Stasis Interrupted. It is its own campaign explaining the events leading up the main campaign, and explaining the events in-between Aliens and Alien 3. There are a few other to look at as well. I’m not asking for you love the game, but at least give it a chance, don’t just look at the reviews and expect crap. Also, actually play a decent amount of it before judging it so harshly.			"

												Prior to playing the game, I read many negative reviews which seemed to judge the game rather harshly.  I think maybe the game was hyped up prior to release and maybe disappointed people relative to what they were expecting.  Also, I think a lot of bugs existed that have been fixed prior to me playing the game.I had a pleasant experience with the game.  It feels like a pretty solid shooter, and the weapons upgrades and customisation adds a little bit extra to the shooter experience.  The attention to detail in the level design is superb, and the banter between characters helps make the game more immersive.  The cliché storyline and corny dialogue, for me, was something I could laugh at and added to the overall enjoyment of the game.  The Stasis DLC campaign also had some very cool missions, letting you take the perspective of three additional characters.Minor complaints - The player movement felt sluggish, making it frustrating when surrounded or when being charged at by the Xeno Crushers. - The lighting in the game was either pitch black dark, or so glaring bright that you couldn't see anything in front of you, adding some strain to your eyes. - The ally AI, though well-designed in some ways, would often behave strangely, such as trying to shoot enemies through walls or solid objects.

												I got this since it has come down heavily in price since it first came out and while I was harsh on it when it first came out I can see it in a new light. It's not a bad game by any means but it is rather bland and adds nothing new. If anything it's a cookie cutter FPS game.The story line is all over the place and laced with plot holes. If anything the DLC even adds more rather than fixing some. Also these shooty shooty bang bang type dudebro marine type games really miss the whole point of the alien series at heart.However the game has been patched since it's problematic release in 2013 which fixes a lot of issues and with the help of mods you can really polish things up and bring it a little closer to the demo. I'd recommend the cilitbng pack, ENB/Sweet FX mods and Aliens Survival Experience. There's also some great add ons and multiplayer mods that really overhall the experence for online play with more in the pipes.I do think gearbox should have put out an SDK or modding tools to win back some of the playerbase as well as trust but thats wishful thinking anyway.If you are a diehard fan of the alien series you may get some enjoyment out of this, patched up and with some mods it can be fun and it's not badly priced as well.positives*Fairly decent FPS game.*Multiplayer can be fun.*With some mods it can be polished up a bit.*Good price.*It does capture some elements of the second movie.Negatives*Textures are really meh at times.*Storyline is a mess and full of plot holes.*Can be bland at times and really drags out.

												If groping around in dark tunnels filled with creepy stuff trying to kill you is your thing, then this is a game for you. Lighting is really dim, so all the fun can be very hectic and scary. The game is  more like an interactive movie - very scripted and linear, and unnfortunately it feels very dated. It has been greatly simplified since the “demo”. The bots are unbelievably stupid and alien AI is non-existent. The graphics are very simple. The good news is, you don't need a powerful PC to run it, the bad news is that everything is very reminiscent of a game from five years ago. I think the most disturbing issue with this game is that Gearbox knew full well that it wasn’t a great game and decided to play crafty by trying to boost pre-sales without allowing the press to review the game.  A tactic that has enraged fans.  Recommended?  People waiting for this game will no doubt be very disappointed, but the fact remains that it’s still fun to play, especially in coop mode. It’s not that bad , but it most certainly is not a great and is very much over-priced. Wait for it to come down in price before you buy it. "

												The thing that angers me most about this game is, well, I tried.  I tried to like it.  It is Aliens, so it must have one redeeming quality, right?  At least one thing I could like.  The only thing I even slightly enjoyed was the more shootery bits of the game, against Weyland and that.  But that to me is why this game is so terrible.  You aren't supposed to be fighting Weyland/Yutani.  You're supposed to be killing aliens, since the damned game is called Aliens.  So for me, the fact that the only part I slightly liked was the even still pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥shooter part is pathetic.  Pathetic that they couldn't do any better than they did, with the years of time they had, and pathetic that the part of the game that should be the most fun, IE shooting the bloody aliens, was a disgrace to even the worst games brought about by the series.  Bloody Nora, it's bad...			"

												Aliens: Colonial Marines, why in the world would anyone recommend this game? Well we have to downgrade our expectations.I would recommend this game if the following things are in order.1) The game is on sale for 5,- or less2) You are a big fan of the Alien franchise3) You pretend the game was made in 20044) You have just watched Aliens 2 and are in the moodLock yourself up, put on the 5.1 surround sound, light a candle and play this game with the film grain overlay on.The singleplayer campaign is better than Call of Duty Ghost, it is lineair as hell but you are not fighting from cutscene to cutscene. This was something which I enjoyed as it felt like I had more freedom (although you don't have any at all). The exploration in this game is also very very low. Several times I found a nice looking secret, but I hit an invisible wall. There was potential for secrets here. The only exploration has to offer is a hidden full armor pick up. The legendary weapens aren't hidden at all but in plain sight. They had the options to make nice secrets but they didn't. It's a recurring feeling the game gives.The story, something which should have been important as it is canon, is sadly very lazy written and doesn't take big risks at all. There was only one moment which sparked my enthusiasm, but for a campaign of several missions long that is not enough. The few cutscenes made in the campaign are terribly done, it looks like it was cutting edge in 1998. One positive thing I like was the level design. You can see and feel that there has been put in a lot of love in them. The architects really do deserve a pat on the back for this. It's just a shame the graphics are such a let down. pros- Alien fans might enjoy it.- Level Design is good.- Better gameplay than Call of Duty: Ghosts.- They are patching things up.cons- Terrible graphics (it's really not ok).- Lazy uninspired story.- They need to patch things up.

												Bad game indeed. Feels like 90's shooter at places and not in the fun way. Then it has some non-fun generic modern shooter mechanics. Iron sights, which are not very useful against Aliens that jump around a lot, regenerating health, limited available weapons picked from larger selection. Even when you do have a larger inventory of weapons (only in the DLC, I think), you are forced to go through a clumsy menu to assing them to ""primary"" and ""secondary"" slots instead of just having all the weapons in 1 - 9 keys like in old times. Must have made it that way for the controllers or something.Graphics are bad. It's also dark and murky probably mostly to hide its badness. It certainly doesn't make it more atmospheric. It just killed me many times because I couldn't see what was going on. The AI teammates could see and shoot the Aliens, of course, but they are fairly useless even as baits because the enemies mostly single you out. Can't rely on them. Might be little better as co-op, but I don't want to inflict this game to my friends. Don't know how the multiplayer is. It's a ghost town.The Stasis Interrupted is DLC is actually almost decent. The story is little better, a prequel to the main campaign. There was some neat encounter design that managed to startle me a couple of times. Even reminded me a bit of the much better Alien: Isolation. Of course nowhere near as good, but improvement to this game. It degenerates towards the end, though.I got this game at huge discount and still made myself to play through it ""because I paid for it"". I do stupid stuff like that sometimes. Don't get this game, but if you do, get the DLC as well. It almost makes the game worht it.			"

												Aliens: Colonial Marines, why in the world would anyone recommend this game? Well we have to downgrade our expectations.I would recommend this game if the following things are in order.1) The game is on sale for 5,- or less2) You are a big fan of the Alien franchise3) You pretend the game was made in 20044) You have just watched Aliens 2 and are in the moodLock yourself up, put on the 5.1 surround sound, light a candle and play this game with the film grain overlay on.The singleplayer campaign is better than Call of Duty Ghost, it is lineair as hell but you are not fighting from cutscene to cutscene. This was something which I enjoyed as it felt like I had more freedom (although you don't have any at all). The exploration in this game is also very very low. Several times I found a nice looking secret, but I hit an invisible wall. There was potential for secrets here. The only exploration has to offer is a hidden full armor pick up. The legendary weapens aren't hidden at all but in plain sight. They had the options to make nice secrets but they didn't. It's a recurring feeling the game gives.The story, something which should have been important as it is canon, is sadly very lazy written and doesn't take big risks at all. There was only one moment which sparked my enthusiasm, but for a campaign of several missions long that is not enough. The few cutscenes made in the campaign are terribly done, it looks like it was cutting edge in 1998. One positive thing I like was the level design. You can see and feel that there has been put in a lot of love in them. The architects really do deserve a pat on the back for this. It's just a shame the graphics are such a let down. pros- Alien fans might enjoy it.- Level Design is good.- Better gameplay than Call of Duty: Ghosts.- They are patching things up.cons- Terrible graphics (it's really not ok).- Lazy uninspired story.- They need to patch things up.

It did sorta not deliver on a few things promised, but when all things are said and done the patches and the DLC make up for whatever was missed in the initial release. It can be buggy at times, but it's not game breaking. It has it's problems and still does, but if you are looking for a fun FPS this will certainly do.			"

												A disappointing take on Aliens. I figured that maybe the bad rep the game gets is undeserved, but no: the combat is an abomination of a Call of Duty clone (right down to fighting generic Weyland ""terrorists""), the story falls flatter than old soda, and the classic Aliens charm is ultimately wasted. It's so bad that even the last Aliens game (Aliens Vs Predator) was better.The only way I'd recommend this game is if you're intending to play it just to see how bad it is.			"

												Alright, so, I actually enjoyed this game. Not in a ""Oh man, this game is like the Citizen Kane of games"", or even the ""This game is pretty good technically"". I liked this game because it was an ""Aliens"" game, and as a fan of Alien, that's why I bought the game (I actually have the collcetors edition). If you're a diehard Alien fan, you'll smile a few times throughout this game. You'll love the sound of your M41, you'll get excited the first time you climb into a Loader, and you'll squeel when you see some of Alien's iconic scenes recreated for you to fight in.Now, is it *good*? No, not at all. The sounds were glitchy, the graphics were sub par, and the story was pretty dumb. If this game went on sale for $5, I'd recommend it, but not for any more money than that. It was a fun experience to have, and I'm not worse off for having played it.			"

												Feb 13 2013Aliens: Colonial Marine. First impressions when launching - there is hope for something smooth and cold about the screen that first launches before you press to play the game. The intro begins and the facial animation seems a generation behind. I work my way into the ship and computer consoles aren't even readable - Duke Nukem era! Graphically this may have been toned down to provide smooth play even on lower end machines. I hope for a graphics overhaul in an upcoming patch or that the GIGS of data somehow includes it. My little handheld motion detector has proven mostly useless so far .... [this was 20 minutes of play, SP campaign]Continued: Saw a few glitches with terrain during the next bit of single player. The audio seems ok enough, but having a hard time with the level of detail that's really needed to immerse yourself in the SP experience. The scripted AI for some of your fellows seems a bit weak and most of the time aliens ignore your AI side and come for you. The co-op with friends and multiplayer must be the saving grace of this title. As is, so far, 5/10 for average but certainly not stellar.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAMEThis game does not deserve the title it was given. The story is non-existant, the AI is the most stupid thing I have ever fought in any game, you don't even need to shoot the aliens, just run up and melee them all to death.The co-op is glitchy and broken, if you're behind the leader you get teleported to them. The animations are extremely buggy. If you aren't with the rest of the group when a in-game cutscene happens then you'll be left out.The multiplayer is also broken. Connectivity is extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥, playing as the aliens suck, again, the animations are broken and glitchy, the third-person camera sucks balls, you get stuck on every little corner, bump, and hole there is on the walls and ceilings while you're climbing around. Once more, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! It is not worth $50 or even $5! Trust me, you will thank me later!			"

												This game is janky as hell. I was so hyped up and such a fan. Seeing the end result of this really makes me wish they just gave the project to someone else or canned development of Borderlands 2 to focus on this. (And I enjoyed my time with Borderlands 2, but I'm a way bigger fan of Aliens)Like, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥what happened Gearbox? The single player campaign is sort of a mess. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI and awful textures. Everything feels so rushed. (it probably was) Also an unanswered plot hole introduced by the game. What in the world? This game really could have been so much more...Multiplayer is slightly buggy but for the most part quite fun to play and probably it's only redeeming quality. You can customize your loadouts and appearances, although loadout customization for Marines isn't anything special outside of changing your gun's alt-fire. I just like being a Colonial Marine. Give this a month or so and I predict multiplayer to be mostly dead unfortunately. Time will tell.There is a lot of other stuff that people give this game♥♥♥♥♥♥for like.... new alien breeds, weapon modifications like reflex sights and voice acting, which you know, to each their own, but didn't bother me. In fact I think it's really just people nitpicking, but whatever. Either way this game is still... not good as a whole product. It's not like the worst thing ever, but it's probably around a 4-5/10 score overall.Everyone is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on this game and in a way, rightfully so (This game got hyped up like crazy by Gearbox) but as an Aliens superfan, I still enjoyed my time with this game. It's a shame that this game is in such shambles because I fear this might mark the end of Aliens video games (not counting Aliens vs Predator, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I don't care about Predators and would rather they drop that franchise)If you are a Alien superfan (particularly if you ever had any interest in extended universe stuff), consider getting this at a very cheap sale price, otherwise you may want to pass.

												Overall 3/5Dated textures. Jerky animations. Clipping models. Convoluted storyline. Bugged cutscenes. Terrible lighting. Horrible hit detection, especially in multiplayer. Bugged enemies, and animations. Multiplayer is a little more polished, with a wide range of appearance customization (my favourite,) for both Marines and Aliens. All Marine weapons are customizable, in skins, accessories, and secondary fire mechanics…But many of the options are repetitive between different guns, leaving the decent sized weapon roster feeling small and bland. Entire fight scenes, missions, and scenarios in trailers and screenshots are missing, or unfinished…One level worth playing, variation of Alien strains, and the fact that I’ve been a fan of the series since I was itty bitty are the only reasons I enjoyed the game at all.

												Doesn't deserve the bad press.I feel with this game it's a victim of having a shakey release, millions of youtubers proclaiming how it's the worst thing to happen to gaming, and their billions of drone like subscribers go out and slate the game on metacritic and other review sites without playing it for themselves. Whilst it's not perfect (Evidence of the funding mysteriously dissapearing and being used on borderlands 2 is quite evident in some areas of the game!) It's certinally not ""really easy"" as people made out. Even on Standard mode, It was quite difficult at timesThe Good :+ Feels Very Authentic to the Alien films, The Pulserifle especially sounds great+ It's own story, not a 'reimagining' of one of the Film plots+ You actually play a character, rather than a generic mute character who just goes along with everything+ Combat is fun, although grenades are a little awkward to use.+ Large choice of weapons+ Packed full of references and easter eggs.The Bad :- Some of the checkpointing is god damn awfull. One segment in the first level requires you to fight about 50 aliens, no ammo, health or armour refills along the way, and it's about 15 minutes of gameplay untill the next checkpoint.-You glitch out on some of the setpieces, especially rubble and the alien biomass stuff that covers some walls-Only one smartgun segment...-I understand it's for adding a 'scary' vibe, but the flashlight is basically totally pointless			"

It crashes on the third mission on the same place, so if you load your checkpoint, it crashes again. I restarted the mission from begining, and it crashed again at the same place.

												Rating: 4/10There is too much to be said about this game. If you haven't heard already, Aliens: Colonial Marines maybe one of the biggest failures this year. While the graphics aren't so terrible, and the environments are beautiful, the gameplay of this work resembles what would be an Aliens game made by Infinity Ward and Activision. Yes, this is the Call of Duty of the Aliens franchise. The player is put in the role of Cpl. Christopher T. Winter, a grunt in the USCM. The entire game is an investigation mission that is full of plot holes and paradoxes that conflict with the story from the films that are even acknowledged within the dialogue, but pushed aside by unjustified reasons. If you are not a super fanatic like some, or if you have not seen the movies, the plot in this game may not be so big of a deal.In the single player gameplay, you'll find that Call of Duty feeling being revealed in that first, your enemies aren't really xenomorphs at all, they are just lemmings in Halloween costumes. They don't behave anything like a xenomorph really does or how they did in the demo (which is entirely absent from the actual game), being that they hardly use the walls or ceilings as strategic surfaces, and they just run at you not trying their gift of natural stealth at all. This calls for some strange thoughts later on when you realize that you've just mowed down over two hundred of these things that killed a squad of twelve marines without losing many numbers other than to automated turrets. It's also due to the stupidity of these enemies that even a new player could go through the whole campaign on Ultimate Badass mode without being very challenged. Second, only three levels of the ten are spent fighting aliens, in the game of the Aliens title. Why is this? Because the other six are focused on fighting Weyland Yutani mercenaries. It really breaks down to being three levels of xenomorphs, three levels of mercenaries, three that are a mix of the two, and the rather disappointing boss ""battle"" level at the end. The replayability is nearly pointless, as there is no choices or different outcomes to be experienced, and so the only benefit is going back is for achievements (much like Call of Duty), and to complete single player challenges to unlock marine customization pieces.I can really only award points to the competitive multiplayer game modes. The weapon and character customization of the player's multiplayer marine and three aliens gives some fans one of there virtual fantasies in being able to do so, and on top of that the aliens are acutally difficult as they should be when controlled by other players. The maps are well constructed and the game modes are entertaining, so it deserves good points there, but the multiplayer just cannot make up for the rest of the game. I would reccomend buying this game on a sale if you have the patience.			"

												This is one of the worst games of 2013 for sure!The game is nothing like in the trailers that it was shown. The gameplay feels clunky and the story just sucks, the boss at the end is a joke and loads of bugs that just ruins everything. Do not buy this game unless you want to waste money on a crappy game that should've had 1-2 more years in development before shipping out.			"

Posted: February 3, 2015
												Now, I'm saying this from the perspective of a hardcore fan of the Alien MOVIES (there's been a ton of paraphernalia lousily related to the seies, but it has convoluted the story beyond comprehension. And don't get me started on the Aliens vs Predator thing...), which I only count to be: -Alien-AliensThe Third one was terrible (who in the flying hell came up with Hicks' death? He -or she- should be hanged by his/her intimate parts!) and the fourth was so lame that its only saving grace was Sigourney Weaver.Yet, this game... it's a complicated business.----------Gameplay-------------Your standard FPS: you are part of the most badass soldiers of the universe (the United States Colonial Marines -OOORRAAAH!!-) and you have to kill the evil ones (slimmy, sneaky, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ic, Xenomorphs) with all the weapons at your disposal (including the iconic and beloved M41A Pulse Rifle). Aside of a few interactions which you only trigger by pressing E in the right moment, there's no deviation to this formula. The Challenges make it a bit more fun, but most of them are piece of cake to complete. ---8/10-------------Graphics---------------Average. At best. Definitely a extreme downgrade from what we were shown at the E3 all those years ago. Still, if you are like me you don't look for photorealism, but rather the amount of detail put into the environments. And it's all there: the famous locations of the movie are recreated to the milimeter (or milimetre, if that's the word used in your country), and those which are supposed to be destroyed by the movie events are made to still look on par with the Universe's graphic style. One of the things people object the most is HOW DID HADLEY'S HOPE REMAIN SOMEWHAT INTACT THROUGHOUT THE NUCLEAR-LIKE EXPLOSION?! Well, if the thing was built with the same metal as the starships like SULACO, it makes absolute sense. But that's just me using logic, don't account for it. One probem I did have with graphics, but it concerns the graphic engine more, I guess: the Xeno's animations are laggy. In one moment they are hanging in the ceiling and at the next they have teleported back to the ground. Their running animations are... funny, too, and there are a few bugs here and there when the Xenos come out from the vents... like getting stuck in the entrance... but none of these are game-breaking bugs at all, I guess it's just a thing that naturally happens when you have a character wth too many joints and animation points, but I could be wrong. Also, the character's faces remain stiff even during dialog (most notable in Stasis Interrupted)  and their lips sometimes don't move during in-game dialog.  ---7/10--------------Singleplayer----------Campaign is, in a few words... lacking. It's not bad, at any rate, but it's way too short, you are just barely warming up to it and then... boom, it's over. The ending hints at a sequel, but with the bad ratings this game (unfairly) got, I doubt that will be happening anytime soon. Sadly, there's also a problem with dialogs: they get to be boring and bland at times, almost like the script-writers didn't bothered to double and triple-check what they had just written, and the actors just didn't know how to make those lines work. Furthermore, there are some plotholes in the story that you can only fill doing two things: collecting the audio logs scattered throughout the campaign AND buying the Stasis Interrupted DLC campaign (or going to the AVP wikia and read the game's plot). The plus side is that it rolls back the awful mistakes made with the Universe's plot in Ali3n and Resurrection and they came up with a really good way to un-kill Dwayne Hicks, although Stasis Interrupted SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE BASE GAME FROM THE BEGINNING. ---8/10---------------Multiplayer-----------In one word? Dead. Not completely, but finding a match is a long and boring process that'll surely frustrate you. To get around this, do as I did: befriend complete strangers that share your liking for this game, they'll maybe even begin to grow on you. Once you get into the actual multiplayer, you'll find that it's a battle between two completely different and asymetric sides: the long-range, automatic fire-power wielding Colonial Marines, and the melee-proeficient and sneaky Xenomorphs. Both sides have their own advantages, and the amount of firepower laying around in the maps seems to favor the Colonial Marines, while the map layout in itself and the plentiful sneaking spots favor the Xenos when it matters. This doesn't take away the fact that Xenos appear to be more favored than the Marines, which forces the players on the Marines' side to rely in teamwork to hunt down even a single Xeno oponent. If you don't like competitive game modes then there's the 4-player coop campaign, in which you and your friends can replay the standard and SI campaigns. The best feature of this is that if you are already playing the campaign solo your friends can join anytime in the middle of the match. Sadly, like I said, you'll definitely need friends to enjoy these modes fully, because otherwise you'll get frustrated by the matchmaking. ---8/10---------------DLC----------------Mediocre at best. The Bug Hunt DLC (again) SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE BASE GAME FROM THE BEGINNING! The only DLC worth acquiring is Stasis Interrupted, for the sake of storytelling. From then on? SEGA's desire to rip us off with unworthy DLC is apparent to even the greatest dimwit. ---4/10---------------Overall--------------It could have been better, but this game is not bad at any rate. Considering its history, and the development cycle it went through, it's not a surprise that the final product didn't live up to the hype it had built up. However, in an of itself, the game is very, very solid, just a bit rough around the edges. Sadly, this might be the last we'll hear from Colonial Marines, since the bad rep it unfairly got will surely affect any decision concerning a sequel. Fingers crossed that they decide to give it another go, and that Gearbox learned from the mistakes it made. ---7/10---			"

												Personally, I feel like this game deserved slightly better reviews than it recieved by major critics, yet at the same time I can understand their low ratings.  While this game is a lot of fun, it felt like it was lacking in certain areaas.   The Multiplayer can be a blast, but the single player isn't as engaging as I expected.  This is certainly a good example of how budget and time cuts can turn what could be an amazing title into a so-so title.  The Game Developers were trying to make what we all expected, however they could not due to their requirements to meet a specific timeframe of release.   What a shame.			"

												I should have known better than to fall for the hype of a licensed game, even if the intellectual property was invented years ago.  Colonial Marines didn’t have to be perfect, it just had to be ok, the prospect of 4 player co-op story is always enough to keep a game afloat if it is at least half way decent.  Aliens is boring with awful A.I and uninspired gameplay, inspired by the wonderful films from the 90s.  The biggest shame of all is how many times I tried to play it for the sake of completion and couldn’t find anyone online to play with.  In short, the community is a totally dead and the game is sub-par at best.  Should you buy this?Not even in a steam sale unless you have 3 other friends willing to help you lower the bar.    "

												So, WOW. What can I say about this game? Dear lord. What an experience. What an experience!Basically, if you came to see 'Aliens: The Movie: The Game' then you probably came to the right place. Sort of. Except not really. Honestly, where Aliens was smart (and it wasn't even that smart), Colonial Marines is dumb, where Aliens built tension, this game just says ""OKAY ROOM CLEAR MOVE ONTO THE NEXT ROOM WHERE YOU KILL GUYS"", where Aliens had a deliciously well-written story and characters, this game has none of that.Yeah, I guess, I mean, at least there's the nostalgia trip! On occasion! Like three times total! Did you wanna see the space jockey? Well you damn well will (albeit with some certain qualities missing)! Did you wanna see Hadley's Hope after the fact? Well, you'll see that too! Sort of! Some of it! Yeah. That's pretty much it. And you know what, Hicks and Bishop are both in this game, which is awesome, excepting the fact that you're going to have to suffer through about 80% of the game just to get here.So you know what, whereas I actually started off by thinking this game isn't so bad, hey I might even recommend it, I'm sorry, the majority of the game is just so bad that I'm afraid I can't. I don't really know how to describe it, because literally everything just feels rushed and low quality - if you really want a good Alien game, I can recommend Aliens vs Predator (2010), it's an infinitely better polished game.I mean, this game, Colonial Marines was just rushed out the door way, way too fast, it just simply wasn't ready to be released in 2013, and the publishers or whoever was at the top clearly didn't notice this, or care. So, sadly I can't recommend this. It's just not fun.			"

												So firstly I picked this up cheap in a Steam Sale and secondly I only played it in Dec 2014. As a result most of the complaints about it being pricey and buggy didnt apply as they seem to have patched out any problems the game had. PLayed great, looked awesome and the aliens were numerous, fast and totally in keeping with the later movies.Only did the single player run through and while the ending was a little weak the journey there was a lot of fun.Is this a great Alien game? No. You want Isolation for that. Is it a great Aliens game? Yeah. Seen people complain the game makes the aliens into cannon fodder.... sorry, James Cameron did that with the film.Bottom line it's a good shooter and if you're a fan of the movies there's a lot of cool stuff to check out and recognise. Stick it on your wishlist, nab it next time it's on sale.			"

												The thing that angers me most about this game is, well, I tried.  I tried to like it.  It is Aliens, so it must have one redeeming quality, right?  At least one thing I could like.  The only thing I even slightly enjoyed was the more shootery bits of the game, against Weyland and that.  But that to me is why this game is so terrible.  You aren't supposed to be fighting Weyland/Yutani.  You're supposed to be killing aliens, since the damned game is called Aliens.  So for me, the fact that the only part I slightly liked was the even still pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥shooter part is pathetic.  Pathetic that they couldn't do any better than they did, with the years of time they had, and pathetic that the part of the game that should be the most fun, IE shooting the bloody aliens, was a disgrace to even the worst games brought about by the series.  Bloody Nora, it's bad...			"

												Aliens: Colonial Marines, why in the world would anyone recommend this game? Well we have to downgrade our expectations.I would recommend this game if the following things are in order.1) The game is on sale for 5,- or less2) You are a big fan of the Alien franchise3) You pretend the game was made in 20044) You have just watched Aliens 2 and are in the moodLock yourself up, put on the 5.1 surround sound, light a candle and play this game with the film grain overlay on.The singleplayer campaign is better than Call of Duty Ghost, it is lineair as hell but you are not fighting from cutscene to cutscene. This was something which I enjoyed as it felt like I had more freedom (although you don't have any at all). The exploration in this game is also very very low. Several times I found a nice looking secret, but I hit an invisible wall. There was potential for secrets here. The only exploration has to offer is a hidden full armor pick up. The legendary weapens aren't hidden at all but in plain sight. They had the options to make nice secrets but they didn't. It's a recurring feeling the game gives.The story, something which should have been important as it is canon, is sadly very lazy written and doesn't take big risks at all. There was only one moment which sparked my enthusiasm, but for a campaign of several missions long that is not enough. The few cutscenes made in the campaign are terribly done, it looks like it was cutting edge in 1998. One positive thing I like was the level design. You can see and feel that there has been put in a lot of love in them. The architects really do deserve a pat on the back for this. It's just a shame the graphics are such a let down. pros- Alien fans might enjoy it.- Level Design is good.- Better gameplay than Call of Duty: Ghosts.- They are patching things up.cons- Terrible graphics (it's really not ok).- Lazy uninspired story.- They need to patch things up.

												Quite possibly the biggest pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I have ever played.I bought this wretched pile of horse manure in a sale for £1.99 months ago. I only installed it a few days ago. Let me tell you folks, I wish I had never bothered. I wish I would have spent that change on a decent game. In fact it would have been more entertaining to throw the money out of the window and watch tramps chase the coins down the street. Dodging cars and punching each other in the face as they seek out the money for a pint to quench thier alcohol problem. That would be better than playing, or even witnessing this awful waste of a franchise. This pitiful excuse for a first person shooter. It's bad on so many levels that I dont know where to begin.How about the fact that the graphics are like something from 2001? It looks and runs like balls. It's got a ♥♥♥♥ing film grain filter that looks worse than the ones from Silent Hill 2 on ps2. Oh Shades you might say, but that's to make it look more eighties. No it's not, it's to cover up the fact that the graphics are awful. The textures are♥♥♥♥♥♥ The guns look worse than those in Doom 3. A ♥♥♥♥ing nigh on 10 year old game. In fact the whole of Doom 3 looks better than this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ And plays a whole lot better too.At the begining of this turgid by the numbers travesty you witness a sequence clearly designed to remind you of an awesome scene from Aliens. But instead of having control of your marine, and actually being able to walk around the ship, you are locked in a first person cut scene as your commander rabbles on at you in a poor copy of the movie scene. This happens time and time again. Sets and action sequences designed to play on your nostalgia. Hey, there's Hadleys Hope. Is that the bit of floor Hudson got pulled through? Hey that's cool, I've found Vasquez's dog tags for no apparant ♥♥♥♥ing reason. The thing is the movie was perfect. When you put these great sets or little reminders of the movie in all it does is remind you how terrible this game is. Yea, Gearbox you dumb ♥♥♥♥s, I have Aliens on DVD. Don't make me watch your version of events! Now, the only bit i enjoyed was the one part where you hide from a blind alien in the sewers. It was basically Amnesia with a Xenomorph and was really well done it must be said. Compared to the rest of the game it's like a bunch of gorrila's throwing♥♥♥♥♥♥at a wall until one of those bits of♥♥♥♥♥♥somehow turned out looking like the Mona Lisa. The rest of the time you're shooting Aliens who act ♥♥♥♥ all like the film. Instead of doing cool♥♥♥♥♥♥like pulling you into vents or ambushing you they just appear and run straight into your gunfire.You have to cover your dumbass buddy every five minutes as he hacks/fixes/scratches his♥♥♥♥♥♥ While waves of suicidal non-acid blood xenomorphs run right for you.

The worst thing is that most of the damn time you're fighting ♥♥♥♥ING HUMANS. They may as well have called it Marines: Colonial Marines.You think the Alien levels are bad? The Alien levels are like having cancer. It's bad but you're getting Chemo. You get cured (which is going to the next level) So to celebrate you hire a hooker. You then find out that hooker had AIDS! And you didn't use protection because you're ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. But even that is not as bad as playing this.			"

												Biggest dissapointment of a game since Aliens 4 or the AvP movies. Bringing Hicks back from the dead was a seriously stupid decision. Why not Hudson, Apone, or Drake? Those would of been more entertaining plot twists. The AI sucks. Aliens are stupid. The maps are poorly made with little hitches in them that get both you or the Aliens stuck. Game just feels like a bad shooting gallery. Graphics are meh. Sound is good but hard to screw that up in an Aliens game when the sounds are already pretty much done for you already.			"

												This game just isn't very good, it has bugs, a poorly written script, there just better games out there.The only reason to consider playing this game is because its co-op and you're into that.  In which case i'd suggest other games first, I personally got this for $4 and well if you and your freinds have nothing better to do you can play this on the cheap.			"

												You see why do I have 11.8 total hours played on this game? Well, because I was so hyped for this game last time, but when I finally got to play it... hmmmm. It sucked really badly. The developers of this game doesn't even care to fix some small errors and details. The gameplay trailer looked so good, but when you get to actually play the game your expectations will soon drop dead... multiplayer is pretty bad.. story line is okay. Oh hey.. The Assault Rifle sounds good. (Jokes, it is equally as bad like this review). GET ALIEN ISOLATION GUYSSS.			"

												Rating: 6.5/10 Recommended only at 5$ and underOverview: First Person ShooterThe Good:+Play within the alien universe spread across 11 levels. Each level taking place in some part of the movie universe.+Multiple weapons that can be upgraded by leveling up and completing challenges+Great use of lighting and atmosphere+Great music and sound effectsThe Average:Human AI, they are not particularly good but not horrible either.  Lots of glitches, nothing too severe but enough to distract me from the overall experience. The most notable one is when I hit a checkpoint in the level and my npc allies magically teleport infront of me. Things like that really take you out of the overall experience Overall the graphics don't stand out to much compared to other FPS games on the market. The story is held back by some poor dialogue.The Bad:- The first major problem is the alien AI. Its just so basic. They charge at you ignoring any npcs firing at them. If they do attack any of your allies, once you get within range they will ignore them completely and charge at you again.  - There is no tension or suspense in a game that is trying to be about tension and suspense. The reason for this is because every enemy encounter is just wave after wave of aliens attacking making your motion tracking obsolete. In the very first level you fight wave after wave of enemies. Rather than building up to this moment they just get it out of the way early on leaving very little room to build upon later on in the game. Personally I would rather have much less enemies however make each enemy encounter more engaging. In the entire 10 hour experience I never really felt threaten or frightened by any of the aliens because they were so predictable. - The game has a few enemy types and you will be fighting 2 enemies for the majority of the game, human soldiers and aliens that rush you. - Probably one of my biggest annoyances with this game is the frustrating deaths. Health gets too low and aliens can one shot kill you, add in some annoying bugs and the frustration level starts going up fast, then you add in some bad checkpoint placement and you have a recipe for a very frustrating game. If I didn't force myself to beat the first level I may have stopped altogether. - Multiplayer community is all but dead and the match making in this game is atrocious. ConclusionIt's not that this game is objectively bad, IT IS playable in its current form however the game is average. In today's market a FPS game cannot be just average and expect it to do well. Like most average games, this game misses so many opportunities to make it good, the underlying foundation is there but no ideas are taken a step further to make the game better. At times I felt like I was playing a call of duty game with an alien remap but with worse combat scenarios. Only buy if you can get this on discount.   "

												A game overlooked by many, Aliens: Colonial Marines has always received very mixed reviews. As far as I can tell - based on my current experience of the game - most of the negative ratings are unfounded. The game in question is very different from many of its' predecessors in more ways than one; the versus system being perhaps the most outstanding factor. (My only other experience of a game from this series would be Aliens vs Predator, and I can only speak from personal experience, so this may be a little biased.) The combat system is on a whole different scale, from a style which verges on a fighting game (Aliens vs Predator) to a game which provides a lot more flexibility through the use of multiple different loadouts and classes for both aliens and marines. The flexibility of Colonial Marines is not limited solely to the combat choices available however, there is also a large variety of aesthetics available (too much in some cases - when am I going to need four survival knives? I'm not General Grievous) including different emblems, tones and camouflage to set yourself aside from your team mates. It is my belief that the majority of negative ratings have stemmed from the fact that this product was majorly over-hyped and falsely advertised before release; this game was made out to be something it most definitely was not, and if it had advertised itself as the game it actually became then it may have received a much warmer welcome.I would say that Aliens: Colonial Marines is definitely worth the pocket change, if not for the customisation then for the large variety of combat styles made available to the aliens (boilers, spitters, soldiers, crushers and so on). Worth it!			"

												I got this since it has come down heavily in price since it first came out and while I was harsh on it when it first came out I can see it in a new light. It's not a bad game by any means but it is rather bland and adds nothing new. If anything it's a cookie cutter FPS game.The story line is all over the place and laced with plot holes. If anything the DLC even adds more rather than fixing some. Also these shooty shooty bang bang type dudebro marine type games really miss the whole point of the alien series at heart.However the game has been patched since it's problematic release in 2013 which fixes a lot of issues and with the help of mods you can really polish things up and bring it a little closer to the demo. I'd recommend the cilitbng pack, ENB/Sweet FX mods and Aliens Survival Experience. There's also some great add ons and multiplayer mods that really overhall the experence for online play with more in the pipes.I do think gearbox should have put out an SDK or modding tools to win back some of the playerbase as well as trust but thats wishful thinking anyway.If you are a diehard fan of the alien series you may get some enjoyment out of this, patched up and with some mods it can be fun and it's not badly priced as well.positives*Fairly decent FPS game.*Multiplayer can be fun.*With some mods it can be polished up a bit.*Good price.*It does capture some elements of the second movie.Negatives*Textures are really meh at times.*Storyline is a mess and full of plot holes.*Can be bland at times and really drags out.

												So firstly I picked this up cheap in a Steam Sale and secondly I only played it in Dec 2014. As a result most of the complaints about it being pricey and buggy didnt apply as they seem to have patched out any problems the game had. PLayed great, looked awesome and the aliens were numerous, fast and totally in keeping with the later movies.Only did the single player run through and while the ending was a little weak the journey there was a lot of fun.Is this a great Alien game? No. You want Isolation for that. Is it a great Aliens game? Yeah. Seen people complain the game makes the aliens into cannon fodder.... sorry, James Cameron did that with the film.Bottom line it's a good shooter and if you're a fan of the movies there's a lot of cool stuff to check out and recognise. Stick it on your wishlist, nab it next time it's on sale.			"

												~THIS GAME IS NOT FOR EVERYONE~Despite the crazy hype and controversy surrounding this game the only big playing points for getting this game is A) Multiplayer Mode and B) If you’re a big fan of the Aliens franchise. If neither interests you then this game is not for you.The single player campaign is average at best, while co-op is slightly better (you still have AI teammates following you around to progress the story) and reminiscent of Left4Dead with xenomorphs instead of the undead.  The story is weakest compared to other games in the franchise, which makes some changes to the Aliens storyline (Then again anything after Alien 3 is a sloppy mess). The upside is weapons, perks, and equipment you setup in multiplayer carry over into single player, making for more diverse gameplay.Multiplayer is where the fun is at, wtih the many game modes that add all the excitment that the campaign is missing, with CoD style customized equipment loadout, perks, and weapon customization. But despite multiplayer being is greatest strength, it is also it’s undoing as finding a game can take a long time if at all, depending on how many people are on it.			"

												I tried to like this game, since I love the Aliens world. Problem is this game feels like it was made by people who never once watched the Aliens movie. Even on easy I have to dump 20 rounds into an alien with my AI teammate to drop just one. What happened to 10mm caseless, exploding roungs? Oh, that's right, no one making this game watched the movie. Then they might have realized that the pulse rifle doesn't have 40 rounds, but 99 rounds and the bullets explode. Guess it's supposed to make it more intense by dropping bullet damage and magazine count or something. The pulse rifle feels like any other SMG you've used in any number of FPS games. You could drop this gun into CoD and not feel like you're firing future tech, but current tech. Another game in the long line of Aliens universe games that can't get the Marines right. If you want the aliens feel, then you need overwelming odds. Put more aliens on my screen.For a little refernce in the Aliens movie, LV-426 is occupied by 70 families. That gives us between 140 and 210 aliens easily. Which in 1986 they couldn't show these massive amounts of aliens with the special effects at the time. Which is why you only saw a couple of aliens on screen at any given time. Yet the feel/narrative was that the marines were facing overwelming odds. One day a game developer will actually watch the the Aliens movie and take notes about the universe before making a game. This game is not it.			"

												~THIS GAME IS NOT FOR EVERYONE~Despite the crazy hype and controversy surrounding this game the only big playing points for getting this game is A) Multiplayer Mode and B) If you’re a big fan of the Aliens franchise. If neither interests you then this game is not for you.The single player campaign is average at best, while co-op is slightly better (you still have AI teammates following you around to progress the story) and reminiscent of Left4Dead with xenomorphs instead of the undead.  The story is weakest compared to other games in the franchise, which makes some changes to the Aliens storyline (Then again anything after Alien 3 is a sloppy mess). The upside is weapons, perks, and equipment you setup in multiplayer carry over into single player, making for more diverse gameplay.Multiplayer is where the fun is at, wtih the many game modes that add all the excitment that the campaign is missing, with CoD style customized equipment loadout, perks, and weapon customization. But despite multiplayer being is greatest strength, it is also it’s undoing as finding a game can take a long time if at all, depending on how many people are on it.			"

												I understand why some did not like this game, I personaly did not care for any of it that strayed unbelievably far away from what it was supposed to be based on story wise, Like fighting other human forces, there was enough to deal with Alien wise there was no need for that side tracking.   But even that was tolerable over the stupid section venturing through the sewers sneaking by mutated husks of Aliens, with no weapons! That section totally blew chunks! There was absolutely nothing like that in any of the Alien movies or games.  Sometimes the AI in the single player game was useless when relating on those accompanying you, sometimes they were beneficial sometimes they could even lead you into trouble.  Now that I've covered the things I did not like, I am recommending this game simply because of all the Alien games I've played, this was not the worst and at times it is rather enjoyable.  However do not pay more than about 5 bucks for it through a steam special sale, you cannot beat it for 5 bucks.  The smartgun auto targeted perfect for me as I read some had problems with it but I had none.  If you haven't played it and you are an Alien vs Predator game fan from wayyyy back, you'll probably like it as well.Edit: January 9th 2017,  I really do absolutelely love some of the levels in the game as I have played through it a few times now I truly love the Smart Gun the little bit you actually get to use it is worth replaying those levels.   I also like the fact after playing through you do not loose your weapon upgrades you keep them.   A couple of tips, if you have access to the double barrel shotgun don't use it, it takes too long to reload, and don't even pickup a flame thrower that weapon is totally useless it will get you killed.   Hudsons Pulse rifle and the main pulse rifle you acquire completely maxed out are excellent for the hord type of Alien attack, Hudson rifle only fires bursts so you have to get used to it, rolling back and forth between those 2 weapons can save you in an intense situation.   It is faster to change weapons than reload, just be sure you did not forget to have the weapon you switch to fully loaded.   Sometimes it is nice to go back to games you've already played and play them again, and that's what I'm doing with this game right now!			"

												Quite possibly the biggest pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I have ever played.I bought this wretched pile of horse manure in a sale for £1.99 months ago. I only installed it a few days ago. Let me tell you folks, I wish I had never bothered. I wish I would have spent that change on a decent game. In fact it would have been more entertaining to throw the money out of the window and watch tramps chase the coins down the street. Dodging cars and punching each other in the face as they seek out the money for a pint to quench thier alcohol problem. That would be better than playing, or even witnessing this awful waste of a franchise. This pitiful excuse for a first person shooter. It's bad on so many levels that I dont know where to begin.How about the fact that the graphics are like something from 2001? It looks and runs like balls. It's got a ♥♥♥♥ing film grain filter that looks worse than the ones from Silent Hill 2 on ps2. Oh Shades you might say, but that's to make it look more eighties. No it's not, it's to cover up the fact that the graphics are awful. The textures are♥♥♥♥♥♥ The guns look worse than those in Doom 3. A ♥♥♥♥ing nigh on 10 year old game. In fact the whole of Doom 3 looks better than this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ And plays a whole lot better too.At the begining of this turgid by the numbers travesty you witness a sequence clearly designed to remind you of an awesome scene from Aliens. But instead of having control of your marine, and actually being able to walk around the ship, you are locked in a first person cut scene as your commander rabbles on at you in a poor copy of the movie scene. This happens time and time again. Sets and action sequences designed to play on your nostalgia. Hey, there's Hadleys Hope. Is that the bit of floor Hudson got pulled through? Hey that's cool, I've found Vasquez's dog tags for no apparant ♥♥♥♥ing reason. The thing is the movie was perfect. When you put these great sets or little reminders of the movie in all it does is remind you how terrible this game is. Yea, Gearbox you dumb ♥♥♥♥s, I have Aliens on DVD. Don't make me watch your version of events! Now, the only bit i enjoyed was the one part where you hide from a blind alien in the sewers. It was basically Amnesia with a Xenomorph and was really well done it must be said. Compared to the rest of the game it's like a bunch of gorrila's throwing♥♥♥♥♥♥at a wall until one of those bits of♥♥♥♥♥♥somehow turned out looking like the Mona Lisa. The rest of the time you're shooting Aliens who act ♥♥♥♥ all like the film. Instead of doing cool♥♥♥♥♥♥like pulling you into vents or ambushing you they just appear and run straight into your gunfire.You have to cover your dumbass buddy every five minutes as he hacks/fixes/scratches his♥♥♥♥♥♥ While waves of suicidal non-acid blood xenomorphs run right for you. Sometimes he has to cover you while you hack/fix/scratch your♥♥♥♥♥♥and it's even worse as he can't hit a ♥♥♥♥ing barn door.And you know what? Do you know ♥♥♥♥ing what? The worst thing is that most of the damn time you're fighting ♥♥♥♥ING HUMANS. They may as well have called it Marines: Colonial Marines.You think the Alien levels are bad? The Alien levels are like having cancer. It's bad but you're getting Chemo. You get cured (which is going to the next level) So to celebrate you hire a hooker. You then find out that hooker had AIDS! And you didn't use protection because you're ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. But even that is not as bad as playing this.			"

												Biggest dissapointment of a game since Aliens 4 or the AvP movies. Bringing Hicks back from the dead was a seriously stupid decision. Why not Hudson, Apone, or Drake? Those would of been more entertaining plot twists. The AI sucks. Aliens are stupid. The maps are poorly made with little hitches in them that get both you or the Aliens stuck. Game just feels like a bad shooting gallery. Graphics are meh. Sound is good but hard to screw that up in an Aliens game when the sounds are already pretty much done for you already.			"

												So, WOW. What can I say about this game? Dear lord. What an experience. What an experience!Basically, if you came to see 'Aliens: The Movie: The Game' then you probably came to the right place. Sort of. Except not really. Honestly, where Aliens was smart (and it wasn't even that smart), Colonial Marines is dumb, where Aliens built tension, this game just says ""OKAY ROOM CLEAR MOVE ONTO THE NEXT ROOM WHERE YOU KILL GUYS"", where Aliens had a deliciously well-written story and characters, this game has none of that.Yeah, I guess, I mean, at least there's the nostalgia trip! On occasion! Like three times total! Did you wanna see the space jockey? Well you damn well will (albeit with some certain qualities missing)! Did you wanna see Hadley's Hope after the fact? Well, you'll see that too! Sort of! Some of it! Yeah. That's pretty much it. And you know what, Hicks and Bishop are both in this game, which is awesome, excepting the fact that you're going to have to suffer through about 80% of the game just to get here.So you know what, whereas I actually started off by thinking this game isn't so bad, hey I might even recommend it, I'm sorry, the majority of the game is just so bad that I'm afraid I can't. I don't really know how to describe it, because literally everything just feels rushed and low quality - if you really want a good Alien game, I can recommend Aliens vs Predator (2010), it's an infinitely better polished game.I mean, this game, Colonial Marines was just rushed out the door way, way too fast, it just simply wasn't ready to be released in 2013, and the publishers or whoever was at the top clearly didn't notice this, or care. So, sadly I can't recommend this. It's just not fun.			"

												Now, I'm saying this from the perspective of a hardcore fan of the Alien MOVIES (there's been a ton of paraphernalia lousily related to the seies, but it has convoluted the story beyond comprehension. And don't get me started on the Aliens vs Predator thing...), which I only count to be: -Alien-AliensThe Third one was terrible (who in the flying hell came up with Hicks' death? He -or she- should be hanged by his/her intimate parts!) and the fourth was so lame that its only saving grace was Sigourney Weaver.Yet, this game... it's a complicated business.----------Gameplay-------------Your standard FPS: you are part of the most badass soldiers of the universe (the United States Colonial Marines -OOORRAAAH!!-) and you have to kill the evil ones (slimmy, sneaky, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ic, Xenomorphs) with all the weapons at your disposal (including the iconic and beloved M41A Pulse Rifle). Aside of a few interactions which you only trigger by pressing E in the right moment, there's no deviation to this formula. The Challenges make it a bit more fun, but most of them are piece of cake to complete. ---8/10-------------Graphics---------------Average. At best. Definitely a extreme downgrade from what we were shown at the E3 all those years ago. Still, if you are like me you don't look for photorealism, but rather the amount of detail put into the environments. And it's all there: the famous locations of the movie are recreated to the milimeter (or milimetre, if that's the word used in your country), and those which are supposed to be destroyed by the movie events are made to still look on par with the Universe's graphic style. One of the things people object the most is HOW DID HADLEY'S HOPE REMAIN SOMEWHAT INTACT THROUGHOUT THE NUCLEAR-LIKE EXPLOSION?! Well, if the thing was built with the same metal as the starships like SULACO, it makes absolute sense. But that's just me using logic, don't account for it. One probem I did have with graphics, but it concerns the graphic engine more, I guess: the Xeno's animations are laggy. In one moment they are hanging in the ceiling and at the next they have teleported back to the ground. Their running animations are... funny, too, and there are a few bugs here and there when the Xenos come out from the vents... like getting stuck in the entrance... but none of these are game-breaking bugs at all, I guess it's just a thing that naturally happens when you have a character wth too many joints and animation points, but I could be wrong. Also, the character's faces remain stiff even during dialog (most notable in Stasis Interrupted)  and their lips sometimes don't move during in-game dialog.  ---7/10--------------Singleplayer----------Campaign is, in a few words... lacking. It's not bad, at any rate, but it's way too short, you are just barely warming up to it and then... boom, it's over. The ending hints at a sequel, but with the bad ratings this game (unfairly) got, I doubt that will be happening anytime soon. Sadly, there's also a problem with dialogs: they get to be boring and bland at times, almost like the script-writers didn't bothered to double and triple-check what they had just written, and the actors just didn't know how to make those lines work. Furthermore, there are some plotholes in the story that you can only fill doing two things: collecting the audio logs scattered throughout the campaign AND buying the Stasis Interrupted DLC campaign (or going to the AVP wikia and read the game's plot). The plus side is that it rolls back the awful mistakes made with the Universe's plot in Ali3n and Resurrection and they came up with a really good way to un-kill Dwayne Hicks, although Stasis Interrupted SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE BASE GAME FROM THE BEGINNING. ---8/10---------------Multiplayer-----------In one word? Dead. Not completely, but finding a match is a long and boring process that'll surely frustrate you. To get around this, do as I did: befriend complete strangers that share your liking for this game, they'll maybe even begin to grow on you. Once you get into the actual multiplayer, you'll find that it's a battle between two completely different and asymetric sides: the long-range, automatic fire-power wielding Colonial Marines, and the melee-proeficient and sneaky Xenomorphs. Both sides have their own advantages, and the amount of firepower laying around in the maps seems to favor the Colonial Marines, while the map layout in itself and the plentiful sneaking spots favor the Xenos when it matters. This doesn't take away the fact that Xenos appear to be more favored than the Marines, which forces the players on the Marines' side to rely in teamwork to hunt down even a single Xeno oponent. If you don't like competitive game modes then there's the 4-player coop campaign, in which you and your friends can replay the standard and SI campaigns. The best feature of this is that if you are already playing the campaign solo your friends can join anytime in the middle of the match. Sadly, like I said, you'll definitely need friends to enjoy these modes fully, because otherwise you'll get frustrated by the matchmaking. ---8/10---------------DLC----------------Mediocre at best. The Bug Hunt DLC (again) SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE BASE GAME FROM THE BEGINNING! The only DLC worth acquiring is Stasis Interrupted, for the sake of storytelling. From then on? SEGA's desire to rip us off with unworthy DLC is apparent to even the greatest dimwit. ---4/10---------------Overall--------------It could have been better, but this game is not bad at any rate. Considering its history, and the development cycle it went through, it's not a surprise that the final product didn't live up to the hype it had built up. However, in an of itself, the game is very, very solid, just a bit rough around the edges. Sadly, this might be the last we'll hear from Colonial Marines, since the bad rep it unfairly got will surely affect any decision concerning a sequel. Fingers crossed that they decide to give it another go, and that Gearbox learned from the mistakes it made. ---7/10---			"

But that's marred with terrible A.I. and player models, silly alien mechanics, and flat out ""humping the bunk"" on streaming end level cut scene with level conclusions.  Seriously the level abruptly ends while I'm pumping bullets into an enemy's face and the cut scene has me flying away in transport....WTH????I've put two play throughs into it.  First was on release...that was... don't get me started.  The other recently and after this massive patch they eventually released.  While my second play though was much more enjoyable then the first.  No amount of patching will fix the short bus style boss fights coupled with a lazy and incompetent story line.			"

												This game is a hidden gem hiding in plain site. Yes I just said that. I am curious to see how critics respond to the game now? After all the bug fixes and graphical updates it has come a long way. It also doesn't hurt that the dlc explains and expands upon what was done in the main game. Rendering any plothole arguements mute. If you are a fan of Aliens you should like this collection. There is plenty of fan service. I recommend playing on ultimate badass difficulty for both the main campaign and dlc campaign for your first playthrough. You may run into some minor technical issues. If your chosen in game resolution refuses to stay upon relaunching, then just simply adjust the setting everytime you launch the game. Takes like 3 seconds. If your game restarts upon quitting then set it to run as administrator. Here is a post i made about the issue.File explorer - Local disk (C:) - program files (x86) - Steam - steamapps - common - Aliens Colonial Marines - Binaries - Win32 - right click ACM (mouse must be directly on top of the letters) - select properties - compatibility tab - Check Run this program as an administrator - click apply - and click ok.Now the game should no longer restart upon quitting.Is the game perfect? No, no game is perfect. Is it worth it if you're a fan of Aliens? Yes. I recommend having the ingame film grain setting on as it adds alot to the visuals.			"

												Screen tearing, time waisting tutorials and over scripted scenes. a call of duty FPS with a paintjob, thanks for screwing up another favourite of mine gearbox software. Aliens was meant to be scary, the aliens are meant to hunt from the shadows, picking off soldiers one by one, not like this game. In this game they charge at you like some japanese banzai from world at war. and thats not because of the the ridiculous action sequences when the ailens get too close and pin you to the floor. I paid £2 for this and I would ask for my money Back. I spent more time redeeming codes than playing the actual game.			"

The story is completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, from the umbilical guy deciding to do that, to the whole background made just to accomodate the movie continuity. I know the aliens are killing machines, what i didn´t know is that marines were made of cardboard. If an alien so much as come 2 mts from you and if it just looks your way you are dead, and you will die a lot. 1 because the hitbox is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible, and second because the pulse rifle shoots gentle delicious berries that aliens love to devour and spit out. Team mates are just dumb asses. Checkpoints are a joke.Then i get a bug of some sort that everytime i leave the game it keeps on staritng it again and again non stop.What a terrible experience for such a beloved franchise. Can´t believe you can ♥♥♥♥ up an aliens game.Don´t give in to your curiosity or your love for the aliens titles, its just plain bad as they come.			"

												During the last 6 months, the FPS genre has been on excellent form, thanks to Borderlands 2 and Far Cry 3. Sadly, compared to those games, ACM is terrible. The story is as basic as you can get. Weyland Yutani do something stupid, Aliens get loose, Marines kill them while trying to escape. There's a subplot about saving a Marine, but the player is given no reason to care about succeeding. In fact, because the dialogue is of the over the top stereotypical military jarhead variety, I actually found myself wishing they'd all just leave/die so I could fight alone. The levels are entirely linear, even during outdoor planet surface sections. There is some decent weapon variety, and an attempt at an upgrade system, but the complete lack of enemy variety renders this pointless. I only switched from the standard pulse rifle when I ran out of ammo. Squad/enemy AI is so bad that at times its actually funny. I cant even recommend this on a sale. Check my screenshots for more badness :)			"

												Why the hate? Just why?Maybe you hate this game because of alien spawn camping back in the day, or maybe you hated it because now you can't find a match, or maybe you just like to give negative reviews. Whatever it may be, I don't understand it. Here is why, first off there is no alien spawn camping anymore, you can find games easily, and finally there is nothing in my opinion to ♥♥♥♥♥ about, lolThis game was boring as hell when I played it alone but after my friends started buying it and my brother did too, omg, never have I had this much fun in a long♥♥♥♥♥time. I was laughing, fighting, and just having a great time with my friends and brother, it was a blast killing my friends as they charged at me, or them killing me when I charged at them.Aliens: Colonial Marines was done right for me too be happy, it is fun, the custamization is great and the alien killing moves are fun to do! Upgrades, killing, multiplayer campaign. I don't see whats with the bad reviews, I have only seen one or two that actually made sense but too me, buy this game if you wanna have fun and a great time with your friendsThank You			"

												I'm a bit confused why everyone hates this game so much?  Maybe because I got it way after its release so all the patches and what not have fixed whatever problems there were.  The game itself is a fanboy's absolute wet dream, having watched Aliens about a milion and 2 times I love all the references.  The gameplay is a bit twitchy but to be honest I've always hated the UT3 engine with a passion.  Its a crap engine, especially for FPS games.  The weapons are perfectly modeled and the sound effects are straight ripped from the film.  I actually find the Aliens themselves way better than previous AVP games as the don't move like ants and when you shoot them they don't just shatter into pieces.All in all an awesome movie licence with great atmosphere and tons of upgrades and silly addons for your weaponry.  The biggest downside is : UT3 Engine, so twitchy and overall never works properly.  And Gearbox. I HATE borderlands, even bought the retail game of the year edition and hated it so much I wanted to use it as a drink coaster, so I'm actually GLAD that other companies took over and finished the game.Its like playing the movie.  All I need is Bill Paxton saying ""Game over man, game over!"" when I die.			"

												+ Nice atmosphere+ Nice movie inspired weapons+ Pretty awsome collectibles+ Very impressive recreation of original movie locations+ Nice story (though weird retcons)+ You can play campaign with your friends+ Movie acurate sounds and soundtrack+ New weapons, that feel very ""Aliens"" - Aliens are not all that terrifing- You can't play campaign with PUG with less then full group- Companions feels really stupid in combat- It takes some time to find you a multiplayer match- Nobody plays survivor, escape or extermantion anymoreAnd there are some weird things I do not know If I should take as + or - ie. (minor spoiler alert)There is a lots of fighting versus other humans (WY company) - it is interesting, at least lore-wise but perhaps it would be nicer to have more aliens instead, altough If I remember, fighting WY is in pretty much every other Alien (vs predator) game... As stated earlier, there is weird retcon, which is really not necessary, though personally I liked it...Overall: This game is NOT great, but it is good. It does not deserve the treatment it gets most of the time. It have decent graphics, decent story, decent enemies... so it is... well decent, to say the least... or most? If you are Alien fun, you should play it, if you're not you can avoid it and you won't miss anything. So my final verdict is... 6.5/10			"

This garbage is NOT fixed. Its still crap just like it ws 3 years ago. Play Aliens Vs Predator. THATS the better game. Thats the true alien  game. This here...is the worst ""lets pretend""♥♥♥♥♥♥ever. Indie devs could have done a better job. Randy Pitchford and entire gearbox can go ♥♥♥♥ themselves for exposing me to such cancerous garbage. ♥♥♥♥... the anger of playing this on max difficulty in the hope a graphics, visual mod would make it better. Its like they ripped off Risen 3 combat Ai and figured a charging, retard spam attack alien would be fun to fight, because thats exactly what we saw in the movies........ Not.Jesus christ. I'm so done with Gearbox. Im so done with Randy. The frustration of not only seeing this♥♥♥♥♥♥all over the Alien Franchise but also of having played quite possibly the worst shooter I've ever had the displeasure of playing in my life. AI still freezes and stands, staring you sometimes. Like a moron. Because of course it does. 2016 May. Game is still garbage. Still cheap. Not difficult, not fun. Just broken, cancerous and offers you nothing but a large slap the face everytime an alien charges at you in the most cheap, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ way imaginable just to spam attack you until you die. Which wouldn't have been a problem if the Aliens came slower, tried to sneak up on you like in the movies. Nope. Here they move with insane speed, clip through walls and appear behind you killing you. Its so disgustingly broken and poorly programmed I feel like dying. ♥♥♥♥ you Gearbox.

												The co-op might be considered fun, if you're in an extremely generous mood.  Unfortunately, you'll still be left with the feeling that you were cheated out of your money as it's clear that this game was very poorly planned and executed by all parties involved with its development.  The further you advance through the game, the easier it is to see that they progressively cared less about delivering a quality product and more about simply meeting their deadline.  It's not unlike a 10-page essay written by an extreme (but slightly charming and able) procrastinator who uses double-spacing and 16 pt. font to make it look like a 10-page essay, and then proceeds to forget to check the spelling and grammar.It's likely that this game will leave you feeling quite bitter, since you can catch glimpses of all the potential that this game had which is, in the end, all completely wasted.

												Colonial Marines is a game that may seem highly overated and underachieved by many. But, if you sit down and play it, and get into the environment, the atmosphere, the overall play of the game immerses your senses and although it becomes more of a arcade shooter at times, it does have its moments. With the customisations, the many different amount of guns and upgrades it helps you to challenge yourself. I would rather play this on PC instead of xbox or PS due to the greater complexity in the play and fun that lies in a horror action FPS.			"

												This review is for single player and coop. [Steam, or whoever, please stop ruining games by making Russian language only for certain regions. Just because some Russians live in my country does not mean we do not speak English and will tolerate piece-of-sh***t translations and dubbing; Spent lots of hours searching on forums on changing this game's language - no option in settings].This game is actually much better than its scores and completely worth the $2/$3 that it cost during the sales. It has been fixed and having finished the stasis interrupted dlc and first three chapters, I did not encounter any bugs mentioned in reviews (such as the funny one on rock paper shotgun), so they must have fixed a lot of things. Even if I see an alien stuck into the ceiling, I will assume that is realistic too because if one is coming out of walls and ceilings, there is a chance they could get stuck (especially with a full stomach).Graphics: Maps are well-designed, cut scenes are okay and aliens are not bad (not that different from Dead Space 3 when you come to think abou it). It helps to remove the film grain, turn down brightness and crank up all the settings to max (with sync frame on). The flashlight is a bit weak. 7/10Controls: at first they are a bit clunky and it is hard to learn how to switch between weapons but after some getting used to, they are okay. The tracker is very very useful to track the aliens in the dark. Checkpoints really suck, in some places you have to run through things until the next checkpoint. 8/10Sounds: Voice acting is okay and not terrible in fact; can't expect marines to sound like TV presenters; they should have normal voices; environment sounds are alright too; everything works well in my 5.1 surround sound set-up. Aliens sound better than Halo CE grunts. 8/10Story: story is average but enough to keep the game going; helps to play statis interrupted dlc first. 6/103D: I am playing this game in 3d using tridef's AVP profile; there are some slight fluid lines when you aim down the sights but with the laser sights on it does not matter much. 8/10COOP: Tried it in coop campaign with a friend and the story and cut-scenes are well integrated into gameplay. It does not feel like empty maps (as some co-op games feel nowadays). 8/10			"

												I picked up Aliens: Colonial Marines for a couple dollars when it was on sale, I’m pretty big fan of the movies and I enjoyed 2010’s Alien Vs. Predator, so I thought, “Why the hell not?” I started it up and since then, I’ve really enjoyed it. I was then very shocked to see all the negative reviews for this game, because it really doesn’t deserve them. Many people complain about the poor story, and no it’s not an extremely rich and exciting story, but it’s a fairly decent at least. And plus, you don’t play an Alien game for the story. Others complain about the poor dialogue and voice acting, again it’s not Oscar-worthy, no, but it’s not anything to hate the game over. Another thing that some mention is the lack of horror. Aliens: Colonial Marines is capturing the feel of the movie Aliens, and the movie itself focuses on the action portion more than the horror aspect, so you shouldn’t be surprised to see more action than horror in a game based on an action movie.Aliens: Colonial Marines is an entertaining shooter game with a decent story, a good action element while still implementing some feel of horror. For the most part you are lurking around tight corridors and close quarters with Xenomorphs hiding in the shadows, waiting to strike. Just how an Alien game should be. And it just gets better if you add in some of your pals to fight alongside you. You can unlock and customize weapons such as a Pulse Rifle, Pump Shotgun, Battle Rifle, and more. You can use these guns in both Co-op/Solo campaign and online multiplayer. The game also has some references to the movie, such as finding Newt’s doll, finding and using Hudson’s Pulse Rifle, and few others. If you feel like you’ve gotten everything you’re going to get out of the game, check out some DLC’s. I strongly recommend Stasis Interrupted. It is its own campaign explaining the events leading up the main campaign, and explaining the events in-between Aliens and Alien 3. There are a few other to look at as well. I’m not asking for you love the game, but at least give it a chance, don’t just look at the reviews and expect crap. Also, actually play a decent amount of it before judging it so harshly.			"

												During the last 6 months, the FPS genre has been on excellent form, thanks to Borderlands 2 and Far Cry 3. Sadly, compared to those games, ACM is terrible. The story is as basic as you can get. Weyland Yutani do something stupid, Aliens get loose, Marines kill them while trying to escape. There's a subplot about saving a Marine, but the player is given no reason to care about succeeding. In fact, because the dialogue is of the over the top stereotypical military jarhead variety, I actually found myself wishing they'd all just leave/die so I could fight alone. The levels are entirely linear, even during outdoor planet surface sections. There is some decent weapon variety, and an attempt at an upgrade system, but the complete lack of enemy variety renders this pointless. I only switched from the standard pulse rifle when I ran out of ammo. Squad/enemy AI is so bad that at times its actually funny. I cant even recommend this on a sale. Check my screenshots for more badness :)			"

												Never before in all the years I've been playing video games have I ever played something so ludicrously disappointing. If you're expecting to find the game promised in the E3 demos, you won't find it. That wasn't the game at all; this is, in all reality, one of the worst video games I've ever played.STORY:In terms of Alien lore, this game does fairly well. The story fits and makes sense. However, it is ruined by multiple groan-inducing plot twists and a face-palm ending. Characters are little more that emotionless puppets that offer no emotional value. The one character that you're actually intended to like has such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI that you end up hating him the most out of everyone. The worst part, however, is the character that Gearbo brought back from the dead: Hicks. Yes, everyone, they brought back Hicks, even after we SAW HIM DIE in Alien 3, he came back, with the most horrible explanation for his return of all time. Even the DLC that was supposed to explain how he survived wasn't enough to to fill the plot hole left in the wake of the third movie.GRAPHICS:For a game of this generation, the graphics are absolutely unacceptable. It looks like a game developed in 2005. There are literal ♥♥♥♥-loads of screen tearing throughout the game, which is only worse on the console, ambient lighting and dynamic shading seem to have been thrown out altogether, textures are misplaced or completely absent altogether, and the worst part is the fact that the game requires higher PC specs that Crysis. I can run Crysis 3 at Ultra settings while still keeping a fairly good frame rate, yet I can barely run Aliens: Colonial Marines on the lowest graphic options available without awful screen lag. The only two things I can give props to for this game's visuals are the environments and the xenomorph designs. The environements, from the rocky hills of LV426 to the Alien hive below Hadley's Hope, the game makes you feel like you truly are in an Aliens movie. The xenomorph designs (assuming your PC can run max graphics) are beautifully flawless, detailed body designs all the way to the saliva on the fangs make the xenomorphs look beautiful. GAMEPLAY:This is possibly the worst part of the game. First of all, the xenomorphs are weaker than my five year old cousin. They run at you like idiots and attack with weak, meaningless maneuvers that leave you laughing at their stupidity. An unconceivable amount of glitches make the xenomorphs act like mental ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that have no idea what they're doing. The game on its highest difficulty feels like I'm playing Call of Duty on recruit. Which brings me to my other point: the game is JUST LIKE CALL OF DUTY. The generic CoD gameplay takes you out of the action and makes you bored, you literally fight more human enemies than xenomorphs, and the mediocre run and shoot gameplay grows dull after the first mission. Even worse is that the motion tracker is virtually useless. Remember the AVP games where the motion tracker was your closest ally? Well, in Aliens: Colonial Marines, it might as well be a roleplaying tool. You can go through the whole game without ever using it. You don't need it at all, mainly because the xenomorphs are almost always at predictable spawn placements, are painfully slow, and hardy ever crawl on any other surface aside from the ground. That is indefinitely the worst part of the game.MULTIPLAYER:The multiplayer takes a delightful turn for the better. With extensive customization options for the humans and xenomorphs, players can truly personalize who they are on the multiplayer battlefield. Combat for the xenomorphs is quite unique and fun to toy around with, but I feel like they're very weak in comparison to their human adversaries. Maps are beautiful and have a great, asymetric flow that fits an Alien game. The only real downfall is the small amount of people that play it.VERDICT:Aliens: Colonial Marines is a lie. A big, fat, horrible lie. The E3 demos were never part of the game and were later revealed to only be computer-animated CGI. For a game that was in development for 6 years, it's insulting to be given such a piece of worthless trash. If you're an Aliens fan, stay away from this game. It will literally make you hat the series. If you want a good Aliens title, just play AVP 2000 Classic, AVP2, or even the AVP from 2010. Colonial Marines wasn't just the biggest disappointment in gaming history. It was one of the worst games ever mad.			"

												Knowing full well that the majority of the community at large looks unfavorably at a game doesn't stop me from trying it for myself and just taking in the experience, whatever it's worth. People say Duke Nukem Forever is horrible, but I loved it. People say Sniper: Ghost Warrior and Homefront were bad; I found good in them. Everyone is different and I believe if you formulate your life around other people's opinions, you lose your sense of self. Furthermore, berating someone for liking something you don't or disliking something you do like only demonstrates your own insecurity.I actually enjoyed Aliens: Colonial Marines for the most part. Now this isn't a grade A quality game by any stretch, but the atmosphere was good, voice acting was respectable, and the story was almost decent. I'm not a huge Aliens fan, but when you pit marines versus a superior foreign species, how else can it play out without flat killing all the humans outright? I guess I wasn't expecting an Aliens versus Predator type matchup. The only thing that really got under my skin was the horrible lighting reflections throughout the game. I went so far as to install one of the popular mods to improve the issue, and while it was better, the graphics were still absolutely painful at times. The gameplay itself isn't impressive; just a generic first person shooter, although the weapon upgrades spruced it up a little bit. The game also occasionally crashed for me, but I suspect it may have been due to the installed mod.Certainly it's disappointing when you have a name like Gearbox attached to this title and you know what they are capable of, but the game is no worse than those other titles I mentioned. I enjoyed it for what it was, but I didn't set my expectations to a point where disappointment was the only outcome. Good bargain bin stuff for sure.			"

												When this game was released I only read / heard bad things about it, especially that it seemed to be an unfinished product. Well, I can't really say anything about how things were before but I'm pretty sure that they were true since this game was heavily bombarded with negative reviews. Either way, there's this friend of mine who happens to be a hardcore Sega fan (even more than I) and he said that we should give it a try someday. Then there's this other friend of mine, who's always saying that everything is crap, this game included. I was actually surprised when he sent us a message someday saying that we should actually give it a try. I thought to myself: ""Well, if he's saying this, there really must be something about it, perhaps the flaws were fixed"". Now, I can't talk much about the single-player campaign because we've played cooperatively. Either way, it was certainly a very fun experience. The graphics are ok, as for the soundtrack I can't really say much because I had to keep the volume low. The story itself tries to estabilish a link with the main plot of the movies but you know, when I'm playing with my friends I rarely pay attention to the details, so I didn't really care for what was going on. Overall, if you're looking for a quick game to play with your friends without any kind of commitment, go for it, I recommend it.			"

Basic FPS controls, remembering how to change them might get tricky at first. (with controller support)Sound. My opinion, best part about the game.Servers. Once again as deserted as Andy♥♥♥♥♥♥s fanbase.I give this game a 5 out 10 because although I did not like that this was a sequel to Aliens, I did get a few good laughs at how buggy the A.I was and that of all things kept me pretty entertained!

												It's honestly fun if you play with a friend. It gets a little repetitive, but if you and your friends can laugh at the poor AI and some of the funniest bugs and glitches ever it's the game to get (especially on sale). I don't recommend this to anyone looking for an interestng in-depth story or people looking for a single player experience. This game isn't awful, just not worh more than $15.			"

												Ok, I paid about $4 for this and I'm pretty happy with that. It's not a AAA title, it's missing a lot of polish, the cut scenes are a wibbly, that's probably the best word to use........If you like Aliens, you will like the locations and nods to the film, could have done with more smartguns....pays decent homage to the film. Just not a well made game originally and it should've been treated better as they've poisoned the name a little...Alien Isolation is immensely good though...Oh and nobody plays multiplayer....			"

												This is a not bad expansion to a not good game, who's whole premises is that  it ties up the plot hole created by the base game.  It promotes itself on tieing up this single lose end, and when it actually goes to do so it's such BS that you realize gearbox has lied to you once again, and ran off to the bank with your $10 to spend it on borderlands 2 costumes and prostitots.  If you're serioiusly considering buying this DLC, please just send the money to my steam wallet, and I will PM you with what happens, and it will be equally as satisfying as having played it yourself.

												//The following is multiple excerpts from a journal recorded by a lost Marine on the VLV Steam spacecraft, only recently discovered on a backlog cleaning. Viewer discretion is advised.\\AUG 30th, 2013: Wow! Colonial Marines is 75% off! I know how much hate it's received, but.. I gotta see this for myself.AUG 31st, 2013: The multiplayer is decent. Not anything special, but it's fun. Different alien classes, different weapons and tactics for the marines.. frequent level-ups and weapon attachments to unlock. Not that bad at all, and I've only touched team deathmatch.OCTOBER 5th, 2013: I finally... I finally jumped into the single player. I don't know the time. How could I? After playing this game, it's amazing that I still have my sanity intact. Only 30 minutes played, but that was... that was a challenge I wasn't expecting.It all started fine, man! Sure, the graphics weren't great, but it was a cool start. Just walking down that space hallway, then it happened. I found that guy, wrapped up in some weird organic mush on the walls. I started to pry him off.. and an alien jumped me! It freaked me out.But that wasn't the problem. It.. it ran away. My motion tracker told me it was around the corner, but I couldn't see anything! I reloaded my gun and carefully tip-toed down the hall.. AND THERE IT WAS MAN! JUST SITTING THERE FACING THE OPPOSITE WALL! I screamed and threw my controller down, running out of the room in a panic-- if the very first alien had AI as awful as this, what did that mean for the rest of the game!?OCTOBER 6th: I tried again. I killed the beast and continued playing. We got to the hangar and that was a pretty cool scene. Marines yelling and having to defend the doo--oh.. that.. alien... oh, oh God. The animation on it locked up! IT SLID RIGHT AT ME THROUGH THE OBSTACLES IN THE MAP! OH GOD, OH GOD NO HELP ME JESU-- //transmission lost//NOVEMBER 1ST: ABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORTABORT			"

												I paid full price for this title. And have played through it on each difficulty setting. I have also gone back and played after all of the patches. I will try to lay it all out.Pro;its $15the patches have really fixed many of the major problems (for me this was way to little way to late. but if your b uying now, its no big deal.)The game has moments of pure funits solo is somewhat fun.Cons;its $15some more patching is needed but I dont think they will waste there time on a game that is kinda dead.PvP is deadDONT BUY ANY OF THE DLC! EVER!The boss fights in solo are worse then anygame i have ever played. require zero skill on any setting. to say that they are   bad is an understatement. watch some youtube. they remind me of those really old arcade games that just make it a blitz of luck that gets you the win, or trying 50 times in a row. very sadover all.if your bored and its on sale for under $10 pick it up, but dont put a lot of faith into this title.

												While it may have been bugridden and too reliant on none-alien combat for a lot of the game, it's still a reasonable game, just a wasted licence, but let's face it we havent had a good Aliens game since AvP 2 and thats pretty old now. If you can get past some of the non-canon story mixed with canon plots from some of the later movies you will find a okay game underneath. As far as I can tell the multplayer vs servers are all but dead now, but the co-op campaign is still worth the price ($1.99) I paid.Expect a game that is about the same as the last attempt and you'll not be too upset, in fact you may even find it's quite good, especially the music and walkthrough levels littered with movie nods.

												Never before in all the years I've been playing video games have I ever played something so ludicrously disappointing. If you're expecting to find the game promised in the E3 demos, you won't find it. That wasn't the game at all; this is, in all reality, one of the worst video games I've ever played.STORY:In terms of Alien lore, this game does fairly well. The story fits and makes sense. However, it is ruined by multiple groan-inducing plot twists and a face-palm ending. Characters are little more that emotionless puppets that offer no emotional value. The one character that you're actually intended to like has such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI that you end up hating him the most out of everyone. The worst part, however, is the character that Gearbo brought back from the dead: Hicks. Yes, everyone, they brought back Hicks, even after we SAW HIM DIE in Alien 3, he came back, with the most horrible explanation for his return of all time. Even the DLC that was supposed to explain how he survived wasn't enough to to fill the plot hole left in the wake of the third movie.GRAPHICS:For a game of this generation, the graphics are absolutely unacceptable. It looks like a game developed in 2005. There are literal ♥♥♥♥-loads of screen tearing throughout the game, which is only worse on the console, ambient lighting and dynamic shading seem to have been thrown out altogether, textures are misplaced or completely absent altogether, and the worst part is the fact that the game requires higher PC specs that Crysis. I can run Crysis 3 at Ultra settings while still keeping a fairly good frame rate, yet I can barely run Aliens: Colonial Marines on the lowest graphic options available without awful screen lag. The only two things I can give props to for this game's visuals are the environments and the xenomorph designs. The environements, from the rocky hills of LV426 to the Alien hive below Hadley's Hope, the game makes you feel like you truly are in an Aliens movie. The xenomorph designs (assuming your PC can run max graphics) are beautifully flawless, detailed body designs all the way to the saliva on the fangs make the xenomorphs look beautiful. GAMEPLAY:This is possibly the worst part of the game. First of all, the xenomorphs are weaker than my five year old cousin. They run at you like idiots and attack with weak, meaningless maneuvers that leave you laughing at their stupidity. An unconceivable amount of glitches make the xenomorphs act like mental ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that have no idea what they're doing. The game on its highest difficulty feels like I'm playing Call of Duty on recruit. Which brings me to my other point: the game is JUST LIKE CALL OF DUTY. The generic CoD gameplay takes you out of the action and makes you bored, you literally fight more human enemies than xenomorphs, and the mediocre run and shoot gameplay grows dull after the first mission. Even worse is that the motion tracker is virtually useless. Remember the AVP games where the motion tracker was your closest ally? Well, in Aliens: Colonial Marines, it might as well be a roleplaying tool. You can go through the whole game without ever using it. You don't need it at all, mainly because the xenomorphs are almost always at predictable spawn placements, are painfully slow, and hardy ever crawl on any other surface aside from the ground. That is indefinitely the worst part of the game.MULTIPLAYER:The multiplayer takes a delightful turn for the better. With extensive customization options for the humans and xenomorphs, players can truly personalize who they are on the multiplayer battlefield. Combat for the xenomorphs is quite unique and fun to toy around with, but I feel like they're very weak in comparison to their human adversaries. Maps are beautiful and have a great, asymetric flow that fits an Alien game. The only real downfall is the small amount of people that play it.VERDICT:Aliens: Colonial Marines is a lie. A big, fat, horrible lie. The E3 demos were never part of the game and were later revealed to only be computer-animated CGI. For a game that was in development for 6 years, it's insulting to be given such a piece of worthless trash. If you're an Aliens fan, stay away from this game. It will literally make you hat the series. If you want a good Aliens title, just play AVP 2000 Classic, AVP2, or even the AVP from 2010. Colonial Marines wasn't just the biggest disappointment in gaming history. It was one of the worst games ever mad.			"

												Knowing full well that the majority of the community at large looks unfavorably at a game doesn't stop me from trying it for myself and just taking in the experience, whatever it's worth. People say Duke Nukem Forever is horrible, but I loved it. People say Sniper: Ghost Warrior and Homefront were bad; I found good in them. Everyone is different and I believe if you formulate your life around other people's opinions, you lose your sense of self. Furthermore, berating someone for liking something you don't or disliking something you do like only demonstrates your own insecurity.I actually enjoyed Aliens: Colonial Marines for the most part. Now this isn't a grade A quality game by any stretch, but the atmosphere was good, voice acting was respectable, and the story was almost decent. I'm not a huge Aliens fan, but when you pit marines versus a superior foreign species, how else can it play out without flat killing all the humans outright? I guess I wasn't expecting an Aliens versus Predator type matchup. The only thing that really got under my skin was the horrible lighting reflections throughout the game. I went so far as to install one of the popular mods to improve the issue, and while it was better, the graphics were still absolutely painful at times. The gameplay itself isn't impressive; just a generic first person shooter, although the weapon upgrades spruced it up a little bit. The game also occasionally crashed for me, but I suspect it may have been due to the installed mod.Certainly it's disappointing when you have a name like Gearbox attached to this title and you know what they are capable of, but the game is no worse than those other titles I mentioned. I enjoyed it for what it was, but I didn't set my expectations to a point where disappointment was the only outcome. Good bargain bin stuff for sure.			"

It could have explored the Colonial Marines and their lives and struggles in contrast to what we see in the films.But sadly, all we see is hoorah meatheads with cringey dialogue and terrible AI. The game is fundamentally flawed in all areas and rife with bugs, glitches and other general annoyances.Another case of putting little into a brand name to make some cheap cash. So sad.			"

(Is God trying to spook my computer with a freaky little personal message or is your game a little goofy?) Anyways, I really do enjoy the shotgun action . It makes me feel like a regular American when I splatter those ugly alien faces . ............... (Several hours later) Ah yes, once again, no real spook in the machine, just a goofy game . My guys got the girls back, and went a couple of levels further, and still the same automatic bootstrapper action with the reloading . However, I'm still having fun with the shooting action, and I do not know why there are so many customer complaints .			"

												I'm a bit confused why everyone hates this game so much?  Maybe because I got it way after its release so all the patches and what not have fixed whatever problems there were.  The game itself is a fanboy's absolute wet dream, having watched Aliens about a milion and 2 times I love all the references.  The gameplay is a bit twitchy but to be honest I've always hated the UT3 engine with a passion.  Its a crap engine, especially for FPS games.  The weapons are perfectly modeled and the sound effects are straight ripped from the film.  I actually find the Aliens themselves way better than previous AVP games as the don't move like ants and when you shoot them they don't just shatter into pieces.All in all an awesome movie licence with great atmosphere and tons of upgrades and silly addons for your weaponry.  The biggest downside is : UT3 Engine, so twitchy and overall never works properly.  And Gearbox. I HATE borderlands, even bought the retail game of the year edition and hated it so much I wanted to use it as a drink coaster, so I'm actually GLAD that other companies took over and finished the game.Its like playing the movie.  All I need is Bill Paxton saying ""Game over man, game over!"" when I die.			"

												First off I'm giving this game a thumbs up but not because it's good, it's not that good, considering that the game only got released last year it looks about 4-5 years out of date (which apparently it is cause it took so long to make), the storyline is not that great and the voice acting (especially from Hicks) is pretty terrible. The reason I am giving it a thumbs up is purely because of how much the game has improved since it was released. The Alien AI is now pretty good bar a few times where they seem to stop a few metres in front of you for a few seconds before they attack again, also they seem to at least attempt to get behind you or climb walls and ceilings to avoid your fire. Unfortunately the only time they jump into vents and stuff seem to be all scripted events. There were even a few moments when the Alien's genuinely scared the crap outta me and the sewer mission where you had no weapons to defend yourself was pretty terrifying, I just wish they had used that a little more.The sound design is also very good, the weapons all sound like they should and so do the aliens. The level design is decent as well, moving from spaceship to planet to colony to alien ship and back again kept the experience quite fresh and interesting and kept the story moving forward at a decent pace.So for me the major flaw here is the graphics quality, it does look very old for a 2013 game and I wouldn't consider spending more than a tenner on it but if your like me and wanted to play it just to see if it was as bad as everyone has been saying then I think you will be plesantly surprised.I would rate this as a 6.5/10 but would have been much higher if the francise had been given the love it deserved.

												Great game! lotta peope disagree but i have played pretty much every Alien/Aliens game made either on PC, Ps2/Ps3 and Xbox/Xbox 360.... gotta say, this game is just fantastic, honestly i think most people are just butthurt because the Multiplayer aspct of the game is not as balanced as it should be, for example, alot of the multiplayer maps are open spaces, and unless the aliens team works together, they will just get merced every time, meaning PvP is mostly geared towards Marines... but the story aspect is just amazing.... games like THIS are not ment to be purchased strictly for PvP, but for the story aspect, and the fact the entire story can be played with friends, just makes it that much more amazing ^.^ the only disappointment for this game however is the aliens AI.... yeah there are some WTF moments were they will stalk you and eventually kill you... but other then that its like flys to a bug zapper... they just walk up to you until you kill them XD but i noticed something, if your playing Co-op with friends, they dont do that, they act and react to your movements, stance and firing lines, something most people wont ever notice because they complain about the story being better singleplayer.... meh.... i think its better multiplayer, gives the game more of a Marines feel and not a DOOM feel <.< overall i give it a 9/10 deducting 1 point simply because of the AI in single player.Futhermore I would like to state something not part of my review, I find it funny how the ""Butthurt"" gaming community attempt to de-rate good reviews by stating they was unhelpful, thus attempting to hide all the good reviews so only the negative ones show up on the general reviews board.... typical and pathetic...

												Aliens: Colonial MarinesI love the franchise and have been waiting for this game for some time. They need to fix the multiplayer issues even though it's still extremely fun and different. Bottom line I've had a ton of fun with this game, as it has always been a fantasy of mine to be in the boots of a colonial marine.			"

												First, a couple of disclaimers - this is the first modern game I've played in a good 20-odd years, so I have nothing to compare this to. I'm also a HUGE fan of the Alien franchise, so I'm liable to like anything that has anything to do with it. I even enjoyed Alien Resurrection and the AvP films at least enough to own them and rewatch them now and again. That said, perhaps it's just my naivety as a gamer and/or my fanboy status for the subject matter, but I've had an absolute blast with this game. It captures the spirit and feel of Aliens superbly, and I find the story to be a most worthy insert to the universe as well. For the gameplay, I find that it's found a near-perfect medium of difficulty, where it's hard enough to present a reasonable challenge, but not so hard that one just gets frustrated and playing the game ceases to be fun. The replay value is very high to me, and just because one knows what is going to happen does not give you too much of an advantage when playing through the game again. Although this also counts as a strike against it for realism, the fact that you carry your entire arsenal with you at all times does make the game more fun, because you can try playing through with a variety of weapons. This can make parts of the game a lot easier or a lot harder, depending on what you want.In the interest of providing a rounded review, I will acknowledge the game's shortcomings as well. There are at least 2 major holes in the plot, with the first being the fact that the aliens will readily attack a character who is carrying a chestburster, something that has been well established in the franchise that they will not do. Secondly, Hadley's Hope (though magnificently capturing the feel of the second film!) doesn't seem a whole lot more damaged than it was in the movie, despite being at ground zero for a 40 megaton nuclear blast.Much ill has been spoken of the game's AI, and while it certainly isn't perfect, I feel most of the flaws are compensated for in other ways. For instance, while the individual alien has been made rather less formidable than one would expect, their swarming and ambush tactics keep them a legitimate threat. Crushers are especially poorly controlled. Their resilience should have made them one of the most dangerous castes, but once you learn how they operate, they become a very minor obstacle. The aliens are noticably biased towards attacking you even if an NPC is closer, unless you are supstantially farther away or out of line of sight. Your NPC companions seem to carry far weaker weapons than you, because what might take you say 10 rounds from the pulse rifle to kill takes an NPC several clips of sustained fire. Their performance at staying with you is also highly inconsistent - sometimes they will happily take the lead and flush out hidden enemies (a very helpful thing, since the NPCs cannot be killed), and other times the game REALLY wants you to take on a particular challenge alone, because your NPCs absolutely will neither lead nor follow you until you have completed a particular task. They will also sometimes completely ignore an alien that is attacking you.The fact that you carry your entire arsenal with you at all times was an opportunity to use weapon/ammunition management as part of the game, but on all stages and difficulty settings, the game is extremely generous with ammunition replenishment. I've never had any specific weapon stay dry for more than 10 minutes or so.Last but not least, there is one specific part in both campaigns where, on UBA setting at least, the game IS too hard, and one ends up just wanting to skip it. Fortunately, the scene in the primary campaign is at the very end of the stage, and once you've beaten it on any difficulty setting, you CAN just skip it, and the scene in the DLC campaign is the final scene in the campaign, so they don't disrupt the gameplay too much.Despite those flaws, I love this game, and I absolutely do not understand why it gets trashed so much. If you're an Aliens fan, I'd call this game a must-have!			"

												After hearing about the horror stories of the release I was cautious to buy this game. As a fan of previous alien games I decided to give it a shot anyway. Downloaded a 9gb patch which was about the size of the original installation. Loved the game. A lot of the issues I had read about have been fixed. Lighting could have a lot more darker patches, menus could have minor improvements, and every now and then an aliens glitches. But none of this breaks the game. Multiplayer community is more or less dead. And the motion scanner function results in humans standing behind traps waiting to be attacked. The scanners unlimited battery unfortunately prevents stealth attacks. I would highly recommend buying if you enjoy coop shooters. It has up to 4 player coop campaign with auto-balanced number enemies & the Bug Hunt DLC is similar to COD zombies but with aliens and far superior as you can buy back in upon death. It has nice weapons espec the Sharp stick dlc which is a sticky grenade launcher. Also dont like the ingame chat with more than 2 people. Using Razer Comms easily fixes this issue.TLDR:Good coop game. Worth buying with bug hunt when on sale.			"

												A nice game, but only if you like the Alien franchise. If you don't like it, the game might disappoint you. It is quite challenging even on easy level: most common aliens are hard to kill. Controls are not very user-friendly, especially if you have to fight using the power loader. AI is not very smart, point-based saving is very annoying in some places. But I still recommend this game to all Alien franchise fans.			"

												Really poor game. Updates help compared to its release version but its still a bland, subpar game. Even with the latest updates there are bugs - I got stuck on the first mission twice when an NPC didn't do what he was supposed to. One to avoid. The 2010 Alien Vs Predator game wasn't amazing but compared to this it is a decent game...so go get that instead!			"

												An average first person shooter. The graphics are decent and consume fair resources at medium quality, but sometimes get stuck, has easy and quick solution: pulse Ctr+Alt+Del, then Esc. Other bug reopen the game, close the Steam window to avoid it. A gameplay bug makes almost impossible to pass the ending of level 5 at highest difficultly. There are other bugs, like collision errors of objects or corrupt save files, degrading the game. A pitty.Mechanics is simple. Player can run, jump and crouch, carring all his weapons with some ammo, but is abundant. The armour is not very effective, but there are many replacement parts. The combat is fast, because damages are powerfull, the explosives can kill instantly. The player can acomplish challenges to upgrade his weapons, by kill enemies or find collectibles.There are a limited autohealing system, the medkits can not carry, but are easy to find. There are not a stealth system. Player has companions, but their IA is unpredictible: sometimes are very contributors, but many other times they dessapear to going too forwards or backwards.The enemy AI is common: humans take coverages and then advances, the Aliens attacks directly from its hidings. All things, scenaries are taken from film of the title, with great similitude and detail. Mapping is lineal. The plot fits with the story of film, and not wonderful but neither bored. The game is injustly underrated by the exigencies of hardcore fans of last generation graphics and multiplayer modes, but its true that bugs deserve downgrade the game in rankings. The 2 main campaigns for Marines and humans are short, even with downloable content, about 20 hours to reach half of achievements in normal dificultly. Only to buy in bundles or with high discounts.			"

												Don't Purchase this for multiplayer unless you have a few friends who are willing to join.The game was reviewed with poor scores in various places - this is a liner first person shooter set in the aliens universe.Weapon options are fairly basic - Auto Assult Rilfe (Pulse rifle), Burst Assult Rifle (Assult Rifle), Sub Machine Gun (SMG), Sniper Rifle (Battle Rifle), Two Pistols (Minimal difference) and a few legendary weapons (Movie Weapons) The graphics are not at a Crysis level of detail, however there is plenty of detail on the guns, characters & aliens.The sounds of the weapons that can also be found in in the movies sound close enough in my opinionI have seen some videos & pictures showing of the glitchy nature of the game  - I did not notice anything while playing through singleplayer.If you enjoy stuff form the aliens universe and you can find the game for about $5.00 then you can get a reasonable amout of value out of this game.

It's A.I. is incompetent to the point that aliens will simply run in a straight line right at you, and then quite often turn around at the last moment and run away, only to repeat the process, or get stuck on something and begin their silly dancing. The script writing is quite poor and in some areas is game breaking, since some of the marines know nothing about these aliens, and yet seconds later will address them all by name and know their every move, at one point, a ""fellow"" marine blows himself and you up with a grenade because he was a millisecond away from death, after an alien had already burst from his chest. Speaking of marines; they are a complete burden as allies. Usually always standing in doorways preventing you from walking through, and never help in a fight, despite having an arsenal at their disposal. The graphics were so misleading and borderline criminal. The game as advertised was nothing like the game received, which is another reason the game was too harshly reviewed.

												To be honest the game isn't that bad since the updates, I bought it cause I'm a modder so no matter what people say the game is best modded and patched. ♥♥♥♥♥♥If you download a few mods and tweak the ini. You can get it exactly like the Press Demo.  The fixxed AI is nice now. I prefer the hardest difficulty as it gives the game more dread and sort of rage to kill the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and they finally seem intelligent this time. ♥♥♥♥ Even humans are intellegent on ultrabadass mode. It is a shame of the stories about this game as it has a unique charm to it being a blast them up sort of game. If you really want the games mood set correctly tweaking the gamma to 1.8 gives it that press demo feel to it. I don't really care blood was missing in the tube only just now thinking about it, It wouldn't make much sense it being that way since they would have seen the xenos in there and blew it off both ships. Kinda have to think about that for a bit.  That one lamp not swiging.  Whooptie♥♥♥♥♥♥shoot it then make it swing if that is all you are after.  Point is That Demo be it as it may was awesome looking - To my heart was still a tech demo and nothing more even the outside of the blownup processor was just a tech Demo.  I used to work for a few game companies, I know how that♥♥♥♥♥♥is. Also both parties are to be blamed on this project at any point when looked at it.  Point in case Mods for this game are good. Really good. Buy it to be modded to the exact way you want it to be. Don't go buying it expecting AAA Qaulity gold here. Buy it to make the experience your own and unique one.  I do takeback my older more Negative reviews of the game after it being patched to hell and fixxed. But a shame this IP will not see the sequal it was homing to reveal at the end. -(not much a spoiler there most games like this would milk it for sequals)- Anyhoot I rank it from my 1 out of 5 to a 3+ because it just barely makes itself near a 4 now but not quite there but mods do make the game an wonderful place to be.

												After the farce that this ""game"" was, I will never purchase another title ""pushed out"" by this publisher again and this includes the new Borderlands (it just looks to be a re-hash anyways). Why throw more money at these liars who so completely gutted the chance for an at least reasonable FPS Alien franchise to kick off. I tried going back to A:CM 6 months after release and was just as reviled then as I was before they released their so-called patches to ""fix"" it. Fixing this game requires a complete overhaul which they would never have invested in - as they cashed in from the profits it made from the false advertising that lured so many unsuspecting customers in to be suckers for punishment, including myself.  1/5 stars			"

												Very fun to play! The game lets you play through several tense situations in typical ""Aliens"" scenarios (escape an alien infested Sulaco before it falls apart, desperately fight aliens in last-stand barricades, play call-of-duty inside the Delrict ship, lots of firepower to shoot at aliens, different boss-levels, etc...).Reading other people's critics, I'm left wondering if other games are so much better, but in fact, the only level I found out badly-balanced was ""The Raven"" boss-fight - final power-loader vs big-xeno fight (never got to pass it above soldier, on a PC).A fun opportunity to play a colonial marine throughout ""Aliens"" scenarios (along with some other ""Aliens"" characters).

												Playing this in 2015 for the first time, I really don't see what all the hate is about. It's your basic shooter, only set in the Aliens universe. All the complaints obviously come from people who expected unreasonably good graphics (game looks just fine maxed out) or from extreme Alien purists who wanted Isolation and not a shooter. I am having fun with the campaign progress unlocks, the guns feel right, the shotgun is a joy to splatter aliens up close.It's a perfectly enjoyable shooter, crippled by a bad launch and unrealistic player expectations.

Posted: March 27, 2015
												First off: This is the best game i've ever played, the people that give it a bad review don't understand. The AI isnt terrible, they're thoughtful. When you see your allies/enemies just standing there, they're not being stupid, they're thinking about their lives and the current situation they're in. When you die right in front the AI and they just stand there and look, its because they care about you so much to the point that they're petrified when they see you in that state, but when youd die, they completely blame it on themselves and think about it for the rest of their lives. This game is rich in lore, i mean have you guys even looked at the enemies? They're all wearing baseball caps, so obviously they're going to the space baseball game that week, and they're all diehard babe ruth fans. If you guys even read the Alien manga (like i did), you'd know completely about the space baseball game, and the baseball cap epidemic, which includes the southern astronauts from Texas that invade space stations after their favorite team loses.         Second: The gameplay. The gameplay soars far above the likes of Far Cry 4 and Gta V. The gameplay is so innovative, because its unfair. Developers nowadays are too afraid of critics to make it unfair, making games boring and too easy. But Gearbox, Wayforward, Timegate, Nerve, Check Six Games, and Demiurge knew that if they had to make a quality game with innovative gameplay, they would have to push their players to the limits, by making them die every 2 seconds when they start to actually feel safe and start to have fun. In this game, Aliens will use their colors to their advantage, hiding in the dark to strike at the perfect time, forcing you to really use your wits to put them down. Enemy humans will flank, and use other strategic positionings to try to take you down, but if you play smart, you should be okay, though it will be difficult, because of the innovative gameplay. Your allies are some of the most helpful and smart AI's i've seen to date. Their personalities and storylines are so interesting and full of life, sometimes i forget that they're AI and not players online.             Third of all: The storyline. In this game you play as a colonial marine named Winter, as he and his partner crime Shaquille O' Neal, fight through hordes of aliens and baseball players. WInter's backstory is so rich in detail, and honestly its one of the most well thought out stories i've ever seen. Speaking of great stories, we have the space baseball players, and the touching story of the baseball epidemic that will leave you at the edge of your seat, and in tears as you have to put down hundreds of these poor infected people, segments of fighting these people will leave you at a moral crossroad. All of these people were just coming to a space baseball game, but were infected by a virus, known as the baseballitus disease. Every day countless people are infected with this disease, making them go crazy and try to kill other people with guns, when all they wanted was to watch some quality baseball, the best sport in america. So now you should know that this game is worthy of the game of the century award from president Obama himself.I rate this game a full 10/10, and you should too.			"

												SO I finally played this game. After hearing hundreds of people hating on it for almost 2 years i decided to give it a go for 15 bucks. I went in expecting to find the most terrible game ever conceived by human hands but what i found surprised me. For an Alien fan like myself i found the set peices, music and atmosphere of this game to be AWESOME and alone justified the 15 dollar pricetag (I would pay more). This game does have flaws but DEFINATELY doesnt deserve the ammount of hate it receives. If your an Alien fan pick this game up as i think its one of the better Aliens games out there (And yes I have played ALL of them). Also i just heard the DLC is even better than the original campaign so im off to play more ACM.			"

												This game took a pounding from the audience off the jump. The excellent demo (and magazine hype) to the released product, was the biggest insult. To throw more salt in the wound, the game play was not the greatest. The execution is poor. On a positive note, this game has some merit in regards to keeping the atmosphere true to the movies. Levels are very nice, and some if not all of the ideas are really cool. Not the best lighting, but done well regardless. Sound is trademark, Music is very much Aliens. I enjoyed this game regardless though i would not pay full price for it. If your an Alien fan, give it a try, if your a FPS player,  wait for a sale give it a go.

												Overall, the worst game to come from the Alien franchize.  The single-player campaign unfolds exactly like one could expect from an unfinished, obvious cash-grab from an incompetent design team. Textures resemble something you would expect from the Doom 3 era, except, somehow worse, featuring both a dull and jagged visual experience. The sounds, although familar to those who enjoyed the film series, lack a certain punch, this coupled with an uninspired, dredfully acted voice acting ensemble. The story arc is also sure in infuriate those true movie fans who respect the authenticity of the Alien Universe. In fact, voice actor Micheal Bein sounds as if he is forced at gunpoint to deliver this hot mess. On a postive note, fun can be had in small doses during online co-op mode, where two can experience the almost comic like deliver of awful, nearly on rails gameplay and insane visual bugs. The first chapter of the DLC ""Stasis Interupted"", is actually a good plot. It intelligently features an everday civilian (non-hero),  making the experience almost feel believable and emotional. It is a small gem in a bucket of sand but to those who absolutely has to finish every ""Alien"" game, you can look forward to that bit before it panders back to the land of mediocrady. 5/10			"

												I played this game ""post patch"" and enjoyed it. I can't speak to how it played on day one, but I found it worked fine on my system. The graphics could have been more polished. The pulse riffle sound was on point. The Aliens do make ""rifle fodder"" and are pretty much running at you like heat seaking missles, but when I watch ""Aliens"" the movie it's not too different. The motion tracker was a nice add on, really useful in multiplayer. As for the story... It was a better than Alien3, Resurrection, and Prometheus. Last time I checked there hasn't been a good ""Alien"" story in the last 30 years so I wasn't expecting much here. Having played all the DLC now, I can say Bughunt is must. Bughunt is the best mode in the game, and a blast to play in co-op. Stasis Interupted is the section of the story they cut out to sell you as DLC, it helps tie everything together. The games campaign is not 1 star nor is it 5. It's a decent 3. Bughunt & multiplayer are the best modes, I rate them a 4 out 5. Match making is broken, so you'll need to friend up, or find a group that plays. If your a fan of Aliens, catch this one on a Steam sale. The game plus DLC for $7 or $8 is a good time.Here are some helpful links for getting the most out of the game.Aliens: Colonial Marines | Bug Hunt	GroupHow to fix the ""neverending"" relaunchFix defaulting to the wrong resolution Visit our Currator Page "

												I imagine that a lot of the people who still speak ill of A:CM when the subject comes up have either never played it, or played it on release after paying full price for it and never touched it again. Yes, I'd be angry too if I'd paid 50-60 EUR/USD/GBP for it on release. But the game's been out for a couple of years now, and it's had around 8 Gigs of patches since then, and I'm telling you that now, it is in fact A Good Game. According to Steam, I've played it for almost 15 hours, normal difficulty, SP campaign and Stasis Interrupted DLC only. (If you want MP, check the Steam forums for a dedicated community who coordinate their activities). And in all of that time, I never witnessed anything game-breaking, or even immersion-breaking (and it is very immersive). It didn't even crash on me.Worst I can say is that sometimes my fellow marines ran ahead and left me alone in the dark (!), and that sometimes, if I got ahead of them, I'd catch a glimpse of one blatantly teleporting in behind me. (Even Alien: Isolation has a teleport debate). I would also tell those who cry about a weak story or plotholes that they're being hysterical. When you read ranting comments questioning where the Aliens came from, just remember that it was Hadley's Hope that blew up, not the derelict (duh). Yes, the dialogue is salty and laden with action-movie cliché – but that’s perfect! Coupled to an intriguing story are solid shooting mechanics, supremely satisfying weapons (and an ace RPG-lite weapon-upgrade system). The sound effects are spot-on; the iconic sound of the Marine Pulse and Smart rifles are almost worth the price alone.Speaking of which, now, in 2015, A:CM is more than worth it at 15 Euros, and if you can get it at around 5, you're golden. Don’t listen to the Angry Internet People, try it for yourself. P.S. Get the Statsis Interrupted DLC - it's almost a whole new game, tells a fantastic story that is even more relevant given that a) Fox has declared it canon, and b) Neil Blmkamp will be touching on something similar in his new Alien film.

												This is not the Colonial Marines game that we were promised. I think we all agree that we want a squad based, challenging Aliens shooter with multiplayer ability in which each player is a different role: Computer specialist, medic, smart gunner and other such roles. It should also have believable enemies that do not get stuck and glitch out in the walls and actually hunt you. AI characters should actually have a purpose and not just be there for backdrop. Gear Box could have made quite the name for themselves in the sci fi genre had they pulled this one off. They should not have outsourced most of the work to other companies. Especially to a company like Timegate. Thankfully Alien: Isolation has brought some redemption to the series.			"

Hard Game To Review6 Hours. I just want to repeat that, because I want you to take this journey with me: 6 hours. A friend and I played through the entire campaign. The cost of admission to get the game? 80% off. If this game had been released in 2003 for the normally asked price, it might be a good value. Did I enjoy it? Immensely, but not for the reasons that one normally enjoys a game. So, it's a good game, then? It depends on your definition of good. If you like things to be so horribly broken out of the box that it's hilarious, then yes, this game is fan-freakin'-tastic. If you set out to play a game where all of the characters have the same facial expression all the time like Vin Diesel in a Fast and Furious movie, a ridiculous soundtrack that does not fit the Alien franchise whatsoever (It would fit in a Star Wars game, though!), sound effects that make no sense whatsoever, and better yet, voice acting that also makes no sense whatsoever...then this game gets an A+ rating. All of these things are available in huge buckets. It's a veritable cavalcade of frivolity and laziness. I wonder how many hours the unpaid design and programming interns at Gearbox put in to making this awesome, unintentionally hilarious game. I say unpaid, because I imagine this was also used as their capstone project to graduate with their associate's degree. How about some specifics? Sure! The animations of the Xenomorphs look absolutely ridiculous. Cute, almost. The sounds for the Xenomorphs are, quite literally, stock sounds of cats manipulated a very small amount. None of it is terrifying, and ruins the terrifying concept of the franchise. The game is claustrophobic, in a bad way - half of the game is running backward to do something. Invisible walls are there, and then they disappear (which is a situationally ironic statement to make) after doing some entirely arbitrary action. Bad AI? There is no AI, everything moves on a track. It is patterned. Either that, or the AI is so poorly programmed that it seems this way. I spent 15 minutes laughing at the queen not being able to reach me in a corner, but breathing heavily and whipping her tail, a lot like my dog does before knocking something off of the coffee table in my living room!Unintentionally hilarious, that's the best I can come up with. Did I enjoy it? Yes. It was so ridiculously bad that I couldn't help but enjoy it. Whether this was Gearbox's or Sega's fault is beyond the point, all they would have to do is change all of the marketing to call it a parody and they would do grand. It's definitely a parody of the Aliens franchise! I've seen a lot of reviews that say they would only recommend it for hardcore fans of the franchise. Nuh-uh. No, because I'm a hardcore fan of the franchise, and have been from a very young age, and I exclaim that this is the worst thing to happen to Aliens since the AVP movie came out in 2004 - and I loved that movie for the same reasons I love this game. 6 hours. Including half hour breaks while still in game, including bathroom breaks while still in game, including meals, cigarettes, and taking my dog outside.... while still in game. You're looking at a good, solid 4 hours of game here wrapped up in a budget title with AAA packaging. If you're all about some achievements - go for it, you get one for starting the game, and then you get one for starting a campaign! Then you get one for firing your first bullet, for getting facehugged, and for laughing out loud at how ridiculous it is. But it's not all hilariously bad. No. What the game gets right, it gets really right. I actually liked the feel of the weapons and the actions of them. As long as I ignored the completely arbitrary upgrades that make absolutely no difference, I thought they were great! I also thought that the inconsistent use of punctuation, capitalization, and plot helped add to the experience and, overall, made my 80% off purchase well worth it. I wish I knew whether or not H.R. Giger would feel avenged or offended, since he was horribly ripped off after the first Alien movie, continually. Avenged because of the fact that this game makes everyone involved in its production ridiculous, other than him, or offended, that they would take his concepts and do everything they can to make them seem as ridiculous as possible. 6 hours. 5/10 overall. Not recommended unless you REALLY like unintentional parodies and hilarity. If you've been playing too many great games lately, pick it up! if you've been playing a lot of bad games lately, I would suggest skipping it. If you're a fan of the franchise, I would suggest that you refuse to connect this with it in any way. Replay value: ...Actually kind of high. I want to see if at any point ANYTHING makes any sense. Actually, no, I take that back, I want my 10 gigabytes of hard drive space back. Also, Vin Diesel rules. I don't want it to seem like that comparison was made in an attempt to insult Vin Diesel, but his facial expression never friggin' changes. Also, i'm going to go ahead and say I recommend this game. I know I said I didn't...but, still, I kinda do.			"

												If you liked Alien Trilogy on Playstation 1 and the Aliens vs Predator games on PC, then you'll probably like this game as well, although the production value is fairly lower here. It's also filled with CoD-like missions (kill a lot of soldiers... while being a soldier, lol). This game has not much developer soul it in. It feels as if they were like: ""Hey, we have the brand name, it doesn't really matter what we put behind it."" The whole game feels like a mod for Duke Nukem: Forever, albeit this has higher resolution textures and better looking models/maps and stronger voice acting. The base game's final maps and the story DLC's final maps have the same thing in common: they are both horribly stretched out. Even with that fact, finishing both stories on the highest difficulty didn't take more than 8 hours altogether. It has some nice moments here and there, but it consists of more boredom and grinding than excitement. I really liked the sound effects though - as far as I know they had the original sounds from the movies to work with, so that's not a credit to the developers, but a credit to the original sound artists. So to sum this up, I'm not telling you to avoid this game, but don't listen to all those horrible critics. There have been many patches already so Colonial Marines deserves a chance. This game is a freak of nature, to be exact, a freak of the dark side of the game industry. Play it and judge it yourself, don't let others tell you how you should feel about it.			"

												1st person, action, alien shooter. Game follows closely after the movie of Aliens. To not give away the story, you play as one of the soldiers. Story is a thrilling and interesting experience. Environments, characters, weapons and aliens hold very close similarity to the movies. Game has great sound effects, ambiance and visuals, good character design, animation and smart alien AI. You will meet some familiar characters from movies. Game supports 4 player co-op, and also some multiplayer PVP modes. If you are a fan of Alien movies, you will like this game.			"

												A:CM is a hard game to review.  The level of intense controversy surrounding the game's release was enough to sully its reputation and earn it the moniker of one of the worst games ever released.  Quite frankly, that's a lot of nonsense.  If anything, A:CM's unwise debut enraged gamers and forced them to overlook a relatively solid FPS that tried to be an official sequel to its movie namesake.  I won't get into that, but I would wager that if the E3 demo never existed, gamers would have been far more lenient towards A:CM's final release.  The biggest problem with A:CM lies not in its graphical quality, but the play mechanics themselves.  It adheres to an outdated FPS approach to weaponry, health and regeneration, and (most shockingly) the A.I.  When I first played this game, enemies would casually moonwalk right into my weapon fire.  It was literally that bad.  Alien A.I. seemed better, and this managed to efficiently knock me out of any sense of immersion.  Graphically, the game was subpar, but this has since been fixed with the automatic update which adds MUCH better shadowing and lighting.  The game now looks and feels like the Aliens game it should have been, but there's still much content and quality that was only glimpsed in the infamous E3 demo.  Said update also helped out with the enemy A.I.  It's not on par with the newest FPS shooters, but at least enemies aren't slightly animated cardboard cutouts with a block of wood in their heads.  A:CM's biggest misstep lies in the story.  It's an attempt to bridge the gap between Aliens and Alien 3, and in that regard it starts off right, but as the story progresses, it becomes more implausible and disappointing.  The ""Stasis Interrupted"" DLC even tries to explain how Hicks was never in his cryotube during the events of Alien 3, but the big reveal made me wince.  I just didn't buy it.  There were, however, many memorable moments in the game, most notably being caught in the Hadley's Hope sewer levels and having to stay totally quiet (while unarmed) while emaciated aliens stalk the area and pass right by you.  There's also a terrifying chase sequence where one must continually close and seal doors with a super-alien hot on your tail.  I even liked traversing the haunting corridors of the derelict spaceship, now tainted by Weyland Yutani research personnel.  In other words......it wasn't the terrible experience I'd been told it was.  A:CM is mired by imbalance issues and some bad writing, but I refuse to call it a write-off, because I simply don't feel that it is.  It's a generic (and sometimes bland) FPS shooter tied to a really great license, and does a decent job with it, but only barely.			"

												AI is a joke.  Maps are so subpar its hilarious.  Half the alien ""scares"" are just generic and often mistimed jump scares. Multiplayer was its only redemption, only its buggy and prone to exploits.Hell you can disable the entire alien team's aspect of stealth by equipping the easily obtained smart scope for your rifles. Just pull it up to have your instant alien alertness picture. The MP scene is largely dead, unless you organize in the forums you aren't going to find any matches within an hour.TL;DR: cash in on popular IP and overall betrayal of trust by Successful Developer.

												Ok so I want to start by saying that yes I have been butthurt by pre-orders before but I really don't feel that way at all here. I think marketing , hype and game journalisim killed this game before it was even out of the gate. I personally did'nt play any demos for it, and I never saw any game footage prior to launch, and have had no bugs at all  so I can't defend those arguments. What I wanted was an awesome squad based and co-op based multiplayer and that's exactly what I got. The xeno gameplay and control mechanics are brilliant and sooo much better than AVP (2010) .  The maps are tight for both xeno and marine gameplay, and the weapons and attacks are fun to play with and experiment different customizations. The single player is basically Call of Duty in space, and I gotta tell ya that I'm more than ok with that, as long as the backdrop and story are in this universe. I'ts not a perfect game by any means , but its a rock solid shooter and offers a great change-up when playing as xeno. It's not GOTY but it sure has earned more respect than it's gotten. I will be playing this as long as there is a MP community. (yup I bought the season pass too) Update:After a few years the mp community is still active in the form of Bughunt. It's amazing DLC and there are game mods that fixed the issues with the Alien AI and graphics that people complained about.			"

												Despite a huge patch to try and save this dire effort it's still one of the worst video games to ever exist. There's so much wrong with it that no review can really do it justice. It has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Here are just a handful of the things wrong with this title.Bad controls, uninteresting/pointless weapon upgrade system, extremely poor enemy AI, bad lighting, bad graphics, poor optimization, inaccurate weapons, doesn't remember which character you are playing between missions, incomprehensible plot and immense trolling potential due to being unable to pass through allies. Not to mention many more things that my brain simply refuses to remember due to the horror.			"

												OK so basically, I am writing this review as a hardcore fan of the Alien Sagas and as a gamer obviously… There has been much negative talk throughout the last couple of years about Aliens: Colonial Marines, but in this review I hope to give readers an honest opinion, not one made out of anger… Also… my review might divulge some minor spoilers, but nothing too drastic that would ruin gameplay… and one more thing… I only just purchased and finished the PC version recently which would explain my low amount of hours… I own the Xbox 360 version since the day before release, and finished it at least 4 times on each difficulty and again for collectibles… OVERVIEWSo we play the role of one of the Colonial Marines that was sent to investigate the Mayday message sent by the marines who landed on LV426 and engaged numerous Xenomorphs on Hadley’s Hope, 17 weeks ago… Almost straight away the game is into the action with numerous Xenomorph aliens and human enemies alike… Half way through the game, it produces a level that slows down the pace as a sort of intermission which I thought was quite good, and once that level is over, it’s straight back into more action and keeps the pace all the way to the end...Now we know that Gearbox promised the Alien fans something quite different from the Youtube videos and it was quite unfortunate that alien fans got their backs up over this… Those that did give it a try compared the game to its advertised state on youtube rather than its ACTUAL state… I’m not saying fellow reviewers are wrong… but they reviewed the game for what it could have been and not by what it is…So I’ll begin with the bad and end on a positive note…THE BAD1>	The AI – Omg this was horrible, the Ally NPCs that assist you throughout the game constantly get in your way, right into your fire… now there is no friendly fire but if you have the game set to anything above recruit difficulty, bullets are a lot more less frequent and the enemy are a lot more vicious and let’s face it… when a team mate gets in the way… it’s frustrating!! On many occasion the friendly AI would block the doorways or corridors (on day one release) but they have since fixed this quickly and cheaply by turning off the player to NPC collision so you can walk through them now…2>	The AI of the enemy is smarter than the Allies, however, the Xenomorphs tend to just head for you not anyone else… There is no sneakiness with the Xenos… in the movies they grab people from ceilings, walls, floors, airducts, grates and dark shadows… yes they tend to come out of those places in the game, but there is no sneaky strategy to it… they see you… they head for you!3>	Aiming is very very stiff I find myself fighting it half the time like some sort of aim-assist is on which makes head shots a little more difficult than usual… and the Iron sights on the rifles are fkn terrible… I personally suggest using the laser sight… although the laser beam on the gun and the actual laser dot don’t even line up half the time… if you aim with the dot and not the beam… you’ll be sweet as pie!!THE NITPICKING1>	The Xenomorphs dead bodies cheaply disappear in a bubbling acid bath, the game is completely linear, why they couldn’t leave the bodies where they lie until they reach the next area is beyond me… Perhaps they got lazy or it was an optimization thing.2>	The use of the mech loader was very short, as well as terrible… The movement was just all wrong… you used to hear the ‘Doof… doof… doof….. vrrrrrrrr errrrrrr whirrrrrrr’, big steps and slow stiff movement… this thing feels like it’s had something inserted in it’s robo ♥♥♥♥♥♥… and it takes really small quick steps like it only weighs 100 kilos….and….. no welder like the one Ripley used on the Queen…. Wtf??3>	The M56A2 Smart Gun complete with 600 rounds of 10×28mm High Explosive Armor Piercing caseless rounds… sounds impressive doesn’t it…. Too bad you only get to use it twice in the WHOLE game… They should have made it so when you finish the game, you unlock Vasquez’s (or Drake’s) Smartgun to walk with throughout the whole game… feeling like an unstoppable bad♥♥♥♥♥4>	Attention to detail with characters… during a point in the game you will notice that you, Bella and O’Neal are really dirty due to the amount of fighting and running around you been doing… then there is a cutscene where you can barely see their tattoos… as soon as the cutscene is over and you continue in the same level just moments after the timeframe of the cutscene… characters are absolutely spotless clean again as if fresh out of the shower???? There are plenty of other ‘little discrepancies’ that don’t really matter… but I just thought ‘Did anyone even QA test this game all the way through??’THE GOOD1>	Excellent level structure which pay homage to the franchise… The attention to detail with the environments is brilliant, now I truly know what it feels like to be a Colonial Marine walking into a trashed Hadley’s Hope… the environment consists of lots of bullet holes, acid burns, wires and pipes, rubbish, airducts, vents etc etc… Everything you saw from Aliens is in this game… except obviously the atmosphere processors where the hive was in the movie… The detail in the environments really sets the mood for the game.2>	Great storyline – Apart from the slight inconsistencies, they managed to link the movie storyline appropriately with the game’s storyline… 3>	The sound was absolutely amazing, if I didn’t know any better, I’d say the whole sound bank was used from 20th Century Fox’s archives… The Pulse Rifle sounds especially good.4>	Weapons were really good and customizable to a certain extent… the Pulse rifle was my favourite and they even went into detail that if you held the trigger down… there would be inconsistent gaps in the auto firing just like on the movie…5>	Graphics are a lot better than ppl think… one thing to do is turn off the early 80’s style grain unless you really like it… there is nothing wrong at all with the graphics… and all the models look great.... maybe just crank up the anti-aliasing a bit! LOLVERDICTI give this game a 7/10… It loses 3 points because of my main concerns being the stupid artificial intelligence, the cheap fixes and/or lackthereof, hardly any QA (Quality Assurance) testing as the product was being developed and the obviously sloppy development process which saw many potential good parts being omitted from the final product… also I might add that since there was that big disappointment to so many, the company should have issued the ‘Stasis interupted’ DLC for free… I still haven’t played that yet…If you are a fan of the Alien Universe…. Then definitely grab this game… don’t pay any more than $15 USD… I bought it for a bargain $3.75USD :D			"

The second , was the great ""Xeno"" Parts. Raven , Crusher , these were really good enemies. i cannot really continoue this writing and♥♥♥♥♥♥, i go write the pros and the bad things.Pros :-*SPOILER* Hick returns! ♥♥♥♥ YEA ( with the ""Stasis Interrupted"" DLC you will gonna understand why he comes back )- Good Coop!- The Playable character ( Winter ) was pretty well voice acted , and was a pretty cool character!- ( if you can find multiplayer -.- ) The Multipayer is good!- Good costumization system , good new weapons!- Many good Easter Eggs- Runs on my PC! :D- Legendary Weapons are cool Collectables!The Bad things : - Wasnt good as they promised- NO DEDICATED SEVER ( almost impossible multiplayer )- Too mutch corporation ( in the half of the game you fight against Humans. IN ALIENS )- Bugs- Too Easy-♥♥♥♥♥♥A.I.- Cutscenes look like Doom 1 - Some voice actor is bad.5.5/10 Would kill every xeno with Vasquez's Smartgun again.			"

												Despite the negative reviews, this game is actually pretty good and worth playing if your a fan of the Alien movies. It takes place just after Aliens (the second movie) but has a new set of characters on a different mission, however Hicks and Bishop from the second movie both appear as supporting characters and they are both voiced by the actors that play them in the movie (Michael Biehn and Lance Henriksen) which is pretty awesome.The plot is above average, but it is really just there so that the action has reason to play out. The action is great however and the gameplay and controls are good (despite what some users have said about messed up controls). The aliens in the game are well done and there are a good variety of them. The graphics are good but they could easily have come from a game made ten years ago. On the downside, there are one or two glitches every so often (however they don't prevent you from moving forward in the game) and sometimes the AI is a little buggy and it occasionally affects the gameplay in a negative way. Also the game just suddenly comes to a halt and just ends  unexpectedly, in a weak and uninteresting way and it may make you angry.Overall, I would recommend this game because, despite its flaws, it is a lot of fun and the multiplayer is well thought out and very enjoyable. 6.5/10.(Additionally, the game does a good job of being scary; particularly when you get to use the Alien radar machine which detects Aliens closing in on you and makes a beeping noise which gets faster and faster the closer they get).

												So like, I bought this game on release back when I had an Xbox, was pretty bad, but now, not sure if it's just PC or the game has been patched to ♥♥♥♥, but it's an enjoyable game now, especially Bug Hunt with friendies! :3			"

												Im a huge aliens fan. I went into this game with the notation of this game being complete garbage. This game was actually pretty intense and a true alien canon of a game. Watch Aliens(the second one), then play this game, then ""nuke the entire site from orbit, it is the only way to be sure''.			"

												They're coming out of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ walls! Colonial Marines was a game I followed the development of after the first announcement. Hell, I think half the gaming community in the world were patiently awaiting Colonial Marines for three long years with bated breath. Would Colonial Marines be THE Aliens game? Could we finally relive those tense silver screen moments many of us saw well before we were truly old enough to watch something like Aliens? In short, yes but Colonial Marines defiently falls short of what was promised and what was hyped over those three years. I wanted to like Colonial Marines. I really did. And in a sense it has been enjoyable. I've been playing it on co-op with mates and it's been good. The biggest gripe I guess from all of us has been the story itself. The story starts well enough. You're a Colonial Marine that is woken from cyro, the last of your regiment. Everyone else has been enjoying the corpse party aboard the Sulaco and came face to face with the Alien menace. Many a Marine has been lost and used to increase the enemy ranks. But this is just another day in the Corps. You strap up your armour, tie on your boots and throw on that brain dome of a helmet and slap a magazine into your rifle. We've got ourselves a bug hunt. The opening is enjoyable and exploring the Sulaco is a feast for the eyes of the avid Aliens fan. And the first mission is what you  expect, kill the Aliens, save your friends and try not to get hugged... Then the game introduces our friends from Weyland Corps, building us a better future by all of a sudden amassing an army of PMCs. I wanted Colonial Marines to be like the movie, low on ammunition, low on allies but with an abundance of enemies. I just wanted to walk those corridors with my motion track glued to my face waiting for that dreadful contact tone... Overall Colonial Marines is a game worth playing as an Aliens fan alone and is an enjoyable game when played with mates. However, as a shooter Aliens doesn't bring anything new to the table but it doesn't have any real short falls in terms of a basic shooter.			"

												I honestly don't see why this game gets such a bad rap.  I love this game!  I played it a lot for the PS3, and still love it so much that I just had to get it for Steam.It's a bad♥♥♥♥♥FPS based on Aliens - the second (and best) movie in the Alien saga.  If you're a fan, you'll appreciate the story and overall content the game has to offer.  The guns are awesome!  You can use the Pulse Rifle, shotguns, submachine guns, flame throwers, etc.  You can even get some of the weapons customized to the space marines in the movie!  My only complaint is that you can't use the M56 Smart Gun (Vasquez and Drake's giant machine gun) for very long.  You only use the bullets already loaded, and that's it.  It's like getting the Star in the Mario Bros games.The graphics are good enough.  They aren't phenominal, but they aren't as bad as a lot of people make it out to be.  I've also read comments from nit-pickers saying it is a ""corridor shooter"".  I mean yeah there are many corridors but that was also the case in the movie... so I don't really see why it's an issue.There is only problem with this game - it's hard to find people to play with online!  The game will not set you up with people to play with, you have to go to the forums on Steam and add people manually and invite them to your game.  It was a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥at first, but I'm glad I did it because I found a lot of cool people to play other video games with.  So the problem turned into a solution I had for finding more Steam friends!Get this game, I highly recommend it!  As I am typing this, there is a HUGE sale on all Sega games.  This game and the DLC will only cost you a couple of bucks!!  Well worth it!			"

												This is actually my third playthrough.I bought this game on X360 first and played the campaign in coop. I did not have any serious bugs at that time and even though it looked s**t in comparison to the PC version now, it was still enjoyable when I disabled the annoying music.The PC version has better visuals, more FPS, and the only bug I got so far is that the game constantly restarts itself when switched off. Kinda annoying.Having said that, it is a very pleasant coop experience, singleplayer ain't bad either. The problem is, people had high hopes for this game, with SEGA's unfortunate promises. It's not bad, but apart from the co-op campaign (which I think supports even more than just two players) and some fun modes in multiplayer (if you can persuade a bunch of friends) the game is pretty average.Only get it with a discount, and it is far better when played with a friend. Personally, I completed the campaign alone first and it was fun for me, but if you are a very demanding gamer you might want to pick up something else instead.P.S. Oh, and there are some great mods online that are said to seriously upgrade the game both in terms of AI and visuals. I haven't checked those, though.			"

												First I want to say that I was playing this game after all patches were released. So I cannot judge people who grades it as ""terrible"". That's why I was very surprised when saw this game at first because it wasn't as bad as all people had claimed before. Graphics after all patches is fair enough. AI is not perfect but very close to AvP 2010 (I launched it specially after Aliens to check). Storyline is typical for such games and can't make me dissapointed. Most interesting parts of the game are multiplayer and COOP  so I can forgive Gearbox (who created perfect HL: Opposing Force in 2000) all lacks which this game has and reccomend it to other users.

												Well I enjoyed a bit playing this coz of the fact I did finish this game despite all the hates and negative criticism.  It's okay for me but not as much like and love that I did on my most love games. If I am to rate this game maybe 6-6.5 out of 10.Pro: - There's aliens.- Variety of weapons and customization- There's coop multiplayer which honestly I love to play sometimes.- I think the Statis DLC is a good one.- It's cool when you use ACM custom settings.. (v1.11c) and SweetFXCons:- I find it hard to feel the tense and atmosphere throughout the game. There are few moments I felt that while I was playing it.- The graphics kinda so so using in-game settings. (You can tweak it to be like on the demo using SweetFX and ACM custom settings.. (v1.11c).- Not so hard even on hard mode except on bosses sort which takes time to kill- Hard to find anyone on multiplayer to play with if you don't have friendsBest played with headset, ACM custom settings.. (v1.11c) and SweetFX enabled. Making it much more like the original atmosphere from the E3 shown E3 demo. Don't ever play this game using in-game default video/graphics settings as it feels like empty graphics quality.Do I recommend it? Mmmmm I dunno I'm confused, lol. But if you're an Alien fan sure is highly recommended. If you're a casual gamer worth picking up at a the most bargain price during sale. If you are hardcore gamer, nah forget it coz I'm sure all you can say is f*** this game.			"

												I'm not certain I can say much more than what has already been said about this game in the past, but I feel I must warn people who are looking for that ""Aliens"" movie feeling.Let's face it (no pun intended), we have all been wanting a good co-op Aliens game, but appart from some Aliens vs. Predator games it hasn't really ever happened. This game was supposed to be it, only to fall flat on its face before the finishing line. At its core you have a simple sci-fi FPS game, although the gunplay is simply not good at all and boring. The guns either handle a bit awkwardly or are simply boring to shoot. Yes, you have an Aliens game where the guns feel bland and boring to shoot! I don't even know how you can wrong here, but apparently it did. The AI which could have made this game fun too is bad too, and it isn't uncommon to see aliens simply standing still without doing anything for no reason at all. The story is also horrible and shocking in a bad way. I don't want to get into too many details as it hurts too much, but other than making it seem as if Alien 3 and 4 didn't happen, it is just a flawed and badly written story which seems to have only purpose; Marketing as voice actors from the original movie were cast for some voiceovers. It is just tacky and bad. When the game was released you would have expected some good grahpics to add atmosphere and so on. Somewhere along the way after their E3 showcase this was completely forgotten, and we ended up with a game that looked a couple of years older than what you would have expected. However, a few fractions of levels hints of what the game could have been, but sadly failed to deliver.As a fan of the Alien franchise I really wanted to like this game, but no love for the franchise can help this game being good.

												Warning, only get this game if you are buying it cheap and for the DLC pack ""Stasis Interrupted"". It will be especially dissappointing if you have played the AVP series too.The game also has a really annoying bug (no not the alien), which will see you exit the game from the menu only to return to steam and see it auto-launching again from stream? I mean that's a unique feature and good way to increase the hours played, particularly if you expected the simple exit button to exit and not restart the game :) In order to stop it restarting you have to kill it before it gets to the loading image.Aside from that the game is pretty much lost in what it is trying to be. Scripted sequences that are under baked, horrible lead and supporting characters and boring goals. There was controversey on the release of this game with the art having been beefed up for some sections of the showcased demo, even if that art was great in the game it would not make up for the some of the other areas where the game fell down.Redemption can be found in the beauty of some well lit smoke filled corridors and rooms along with some epic sound design.. I mean who doesn't love the sound the marines guns from this franchise?However, I can't recommend this game standalone, you really need to get it on sale with the DLC I mentioned above.			"

I mean that's a unique feature and good way to increase the hours played, particularly if you expected the simple exit button to exit and not restart the game :) In order to stop it restarting you have to kill it before it gets to the loading image.Aside from that the game is pretty much lost in what it is trying to be. Scripted sequences that are under baked, horrible lead and supporting characters and boring goals. There was controversey on the release of this game with the art having been beefed up for some sections of the showcased demo, even if that art was great in the game it would not make up for the some of the other areas where the game fell down.Redemption can be found in the beauty of some well lit smoke filled corridors and rooms along with some epic sound design.. I mean who doesn't love the sound the marines guns from this franchise?However, I can't recommend this game standalone, you really need to get it on sale with the DLC I mentioned above.			"

												Waste of time...sadly.. so save your moneyThis is not nearly as good as it should be.  the way the game plays reminds me of game play of a few years ago. clunky.. theres a delay whan you need critical things to happen.. when you die it takes thirty seconds to get back into the game! no game saving as you progress and despite wide open spaces you cannot go  anywhere other than the narrow gameplay area..(I have been spoilt by the STALKER series or MW3).But worst of all is reaching an unplayable section!.  powerloader versus boss,   I tried for a week... no dice looked at loads of websites to no avail... there is just no way you can do it unless ou are extremely lucky!....So I have joined the large section of other PC gamers who just have to give it up......I was looking at the alien isolation game next...going to wait and see what the web makes of it first...

												This game is not as bad as everyone says, was it worth the $50 pricetag when it came out? No. Is it worth $15? Yes. If you play co-op with another Alien nerd the two of you will have a blast, or even up to four. If you don't know anything about the Alien series then you will not like this game.			"

												If your a fan of the Alien series go for it, there are a ton of references and locations used in the movie you can explore in this game. Overall it's not that long maybe 5-6 hours depending on what difficulty you play on, sure gots some glitches here and there and there isn't a lot of alien diversity but still had more than the movies.I give this game a 5.5/10, just fun enough to keep you going but you'd only play it once.

												This game.. we waited so long for a new alien game to play, and then what happens?Bugs alot of them and its not the alien bug's that for some reason dance in every doorway or just straight up make a faceplant in the floor thats right the ingame bugs.Flashlight:FlickersShadows:Cant deside on how to be dark or light,flickers.AI:So stupid you laugh your self half to death.Online Multiplayer: Unless you have a friend to play with the online community for this game is dead.Story: Well not really interesting to be honest, the talk marine to marine and the fealing of the game is like, ""why you yell so load"" and ""dont call me nugget"" soo yea awsome story erm nugget.Weapons and UI: UI is ok it works not the best but still works, Weapons are wierd they look wierd sized somehow and kinda feals like the pulse rifle is big as a house but hits like a ""ant""..Music and sound's: No, music is of que the scream bam! effects are ok but sometimes fail to execute.Ingame video: BAD looks like something resurected from resident evil 1, jesus.Should you buy this game?Only if u cant live without trying it, only if you intend to just sit there and have a laugh and send money on the worst developed game i have ever seen. do us all a favor dont buy this game, just try to make a new alien game because we are all waiting for it.

												It's not all bad: moving and shooting is basically competent, most of the minute-to-minute stuff in the levels was decent but linear. Some visual design aspects were nice, collectibles were neat, and the stealth level is really cool.But it's mostly a terrible game. The weapon upgrading system is shallow, weapon variety sucks, combat design is awful and consists of waves of identical boring enemies coming after you, graphics are hit-and-miss, the boss fights are awful (the first boss fight is actually the more tedious, frustrating, stupid boss fight design I've ever seen in a game. Seriously.) The game is built around cover combat but there's no cover. There are almost no interesting setpieces and the levels aren't labyrinthine or fun to move around to make up for it. Damage feedback is poor, QTEs, boring object interaction, etc. The game uses very poorly made checkpoints. Lots of checkpoint -> long walking section -> tons of combat -> long walking section -> combat -> checkpoint, so if you die near the end you repeat stuff that wasn't necessarily hard, just long and boring. I'd say dying and repeating added 3-4 hours to my playthrough on Hard.The story, characters, and dialogue are all obnoxious and incomprehensible. If you're an Alien fan, there's a massive event that retroactively changes the plot of Alien 3. If you're not an Alien fan, this is nonsense. The game makes no sense. By the end of the game I still couldn't tell most of the main characters apart and I didn't have a clue why characters were angry and at who and really what was going on.If you want to play a good game, don't play this. If you want to play a bad game that's bad-good, this is more bad-frustrating. I wouldn't expect much joy to come from this. It's not the worst game ever made. I'd give it a 4 or 5/10.			"

												Did you watch the movies? Did you watch them again after seeing the ""famous"" E3 gameplay demo? Did you hope for a good aliens experience? Hah! You can hope all you want. Hope in this case is the mother of fools.This game is completely washed off from all the tension, horror, screams and jumps that accompany all the movies and all previous games based on the franchise. Bland lighting effects, bland particle effects and super bland aliens movement. The animations are probably the last nail in the coffin. All bugs sneak (Ye, right), jump, move and attack in such a dreadful, uninspired motion that it hurts to watch it. It is good to kill them though. It makes you feel that you put them out of their misery one burst at a time. The story at first seems to be interesting since it is set between Aliens 2 and 3. Sadly, it is the same old story as in most Aliens games. We have the evil Weyland-Yutani corporation trying to domisticate the Aliens using myriads of innocent people as hosts. One of the Marines gets infected and you will try to save him (You don't need to guess how it turns out). There is some bla bla abou Hicks but you see him first at the intro cutscene and then...well then he will make an appearance. Dunno what exactly will it be since I have to go through 3 more levels to complete the game...wouldn't count on much though.Save your cash, buy only if heavily discounted and when there are other friends you will play it with. It has 3 player co-op campaign. People really paid 60$ on launch for a game that lasts for max 7 hours? Pre-ordered it? Bah...poor guys... "

												Played till the end because of the story. I'm a fan of the franchise, and for those who wonder, you get to meet some characters and familiar places from the movies, and you get to hear that distinguishing sound of that weapon that immediately tells you it's an Alien universe. In more depth, the setting is just after the events of Aliens (2nd movie). You are the search and rescue team on a mission to find out what happened to the last search and rescue team (inception?). This time the enemies are not exclusively Aliens. Typical army behaviours ""shoot first, ask questions later"" leads the story to quick extermination of anything that is alive and moves, from both your side and the enemies'. Childish grudges drive the majority of the squad. Through out the story you get to be around 4-5 named characters, your superior officer, and some other marines. Although you feel exactly like the main character in Aliens, outnumbered and impulsive, your superior officer keeps on referring to hundreds of heads he is responsible to ""get off that rock"". I'd say the ending is a bit cliche, but oh well.Graphics are good. Dark setting, textures seemed high rez enough. Good uses of lighting, mostly. Details are close to accurate as the movies, environments easily recognizable, but used multiple times though out the story. I did not notice any major changes between different visits to the same settings. They did however introduce new ""species"" of aliens, with different abilities.Mechanics. Well... um... mediocre. From marines bugging on ladders, to aliens moving though the walls, this game has it all. Some environments provide points where you just stand and cannot be attacked by the enemies, makes it a bit less thrilling. Marine movements and animations are in good standing, apart from facial animation during cut scenes and speaches. Alien movements are less polished. Felt mechanical at the very least, with strange movements in unnatural manner (Aliens? unnatural movements? are you listening to yourself?). AI in this game is at the lowest standing. Everything and everyone is going straight for you, everytime. 10 other marines in front of you? shooting at the creature point blank? you chill in the back choosing another weapon? Guess what? They love you and want a hug. And while on the subject of other marines in the front, it doesn't seem like they have any health bars or anything, they can stand in the middle of the field, getting fired upon, zerged by everything, but yet go like /care and carry on. But if you get to show up from behind a crate on the other side of the map, boom, headshot.Overally I believe the game could have been better. But I got it on winter sale, after the ""major"" update. So I can't complain. Haven't played the multiplayer yet.			"

												ORIGINAL REVIEWDo I really need to say?--------UPDATED REVIEW [April 10th, 2015]Christ, I really didn't say much back then, did I?tl;dr at the bottomBut in all seriousness, everyone at the time knew of the bad press surrounding this game, and for good reason: with what Gearbox had showed the public through trailers and promotions, ALIENS COLONIAL MARINES looked like a fantastic Aliens title that could potentially expand and add to the lore.The cooperative gameplay looked intense and we all couldn't wait to jump into the boots of the Colonial Marines.I was one of the unfortunate suckers that pre-ordered the game and were horrified to find an incomplete and barely-functioning game that held little semblance to the one we were promised. We felt cheated and had, with some even going so far as to file lawsuits.Since then, the game has been patched and updated somewhat. For laughs, an online friend decided to pick the game up for cheap, and I played with him, finally completing the game for the first time.The graphics have been updated and look much better than the visuals at initial release, but are still mediocre at best. There are tons of screen-tearing moments, assets moving through one another, and sometimes seeing through walls like I'm Superman. Though the environments are sometimes decently-crafted, it's hard to tell as entirely different structures somehow look the same. Half the time I couldn't tell where I was and had to open my motion tracker to find where the objectives were.The AI is absolutely brain-dead, no other game's AI can hold a candle to ALIENS COLONIAL MARINES (except for Ride To Hell: Retribution, perhaps). Your AI comrades either lag miles behind or run forward with reckless abandon, and you'll either have to wait minutes for them to catch up to doors only they can open, or you'll have to run down corridors shooting all the xenomorphs they've triggered.The enemy AI doesn't fare much better, with xenomorphs running around like chickens and human fighters moving like robots. Also, you fight a lot of humans in a game about aliens. Kind of strange, isn't it? And with very few variations in enemy types, combat feels nothing more than campaign padding.The story is dreary and actually feels like it is disrespecting the source material, rather than enriching it. The entire cast is poorly performed and character actions feel nonsensical and pointless. The little references to the original Aliens movie feel token and hokey, with so-called Legendary weapons found in random locations that don't tie in with the film. I really don't know what else to say. Honestly, my friends and I had a laugh playing the game, but we still found some fun in it; the gameplay wasn't the most stable, but we still enjoyed fending off waves of xenomorphs while defending a hack, and there were moments where I felt tension and a need to hurry.Ultimately, new updates couldn't save this game. If you and your friends pick up the game for cheap, you might have a decent time with it. But ALIENS COLONIAL MARINES is a game best left to rest. Though it's far from being the worst game I've ever played, it's also far from being a great one.-------tl;dr+Locales feel authentic+Xenomorphs, in certain scenarios, are terrifying to deal with+Nice personal gun customization+Somewhat enjoyable coop experience, where you feel more badass fighting with friends at your side-Unimpressive graphics, poor presentation-Gameplay is unstable at best, as are assets-AI is shoddy and unreliable, both as an enemy and ally-Story is boring and slow, characters unlikeable-Homage to source material feels shallow and disrespectful-Sound is buggy and awful-Guns lack accuracy, especially gun sights-Bosses and enemies are easy to glitch and exploit-Ending is unbelievably awful, completely flacid			"

												If your a fan of the Alien series go for it, there are a ton of references and locations used in the movie you can explore in this game. Overall it's not that long maybe 5-6 hours depending on what difficulty you play on, sure gots some glitches here and there and there isn't a lot of alien diversity but still had more than the movies.I give this game a 5.5/10, just fun enough to keep you going but you'd only play it once.

												This game.. we waited so long for a new alien game to play, and then what happens?Bugs alot of them and its not the alien bug's that for some reason dance in every doorway or just straight up make a faceplant in the floor thats right the ingame bugs.Flashlight:FlickersShadows:Cant deside on how to be dark or light,flickers.AI:So stupid you laugh your self half to death.Online Multiplayer: Unless you have a friend to play with the online community for this game is dead.Story: Well not really interesting to be honest, the talk marine to marine and the fealing of the game is like, ""why you yell so load"" and ""dont call me nugget"" soo yea awsome story erm nugget.Weapons and UI: UI is ok it works not the best but still works, Weapons are wierd they look wierd sized somehow and kinda feals like the pulse rifle is big as a house but hits like a ""ant""..Music and sound's: No, music is of que the scream bam! effects are ok but sometimes fail to execute.Ingame video: BAD looks like something resurected from resident evil 1, jesus.Should you buy this game?Only if u cant live without trying it, only if you intend to just sit there and have a laugh and send money on the worst developed game i have ever seen. do us all a favor dont buy this game, just try to make a new alien game because we are all waiting for it.

												The game is really cool, especially for a fan of Aliens like me. Just finished my second walkthrough on the hardest difficulty. The first time I did beat it was right after release, so I decided to refresh my memories a week ago.  Good thing I did not drop it after I played around 90 minutes, I already started thinking how could I beat this game before, it is not that good, wth? The game mechanics and graphics were kinda weird and the ultimate badass difficulty seemed super hard for me. But next day I decided to continue and I finally got completely fascinated by the game. I had a lot of fun. The only a little bit annoying con for me is AI, not that much of aliens as of the human warriors. So yeah, the hardest difficulty is not that hard once you adapted to it.And about MP... As I remember, it was really good and entertaining. Will definitely play again.I rate the game 7.5/10			"

												If you are looking for a great game to play with awesome AI, great character development, and amazing Aliens, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.    Aliens CM is the worst Alien game I have had the chance to play, and I have played them all. This game is seriously not worth the money even on a discounted price. The graphics are subpar, the AI is honestly worse than games made 15 years ago, AI pathing is atrocious, and the Aliens themselves are just bullet sponges that offer virtually no content to the game. I played the 4.2 hours of the game that I could stomach and have yet to play it again. I refuse to see someone destroy a lore and universe that has brought me so much joy. "

												Did you watch the movies? Did you watch them again after seeing the ""famous"" E3 gameplay demo? Did you hope for a good aliens experience? Hah! You can hope all you want. Hope in this case is the mother of fools.This game is completely washed off from all the tension, horror, screams and jumps that accompany all the movies and all previous games based on the franchise. Bland lighting effects, bland particle effects and super bland aliens movement. The animations are probably the last nail in the coffin. All bugs sneak (Ye, right), jump, move and attack in such a dreadful, uninspired motion that it hurts to watch it. It is good to kill them though. It makes you feel that you put them out of their misery one burst at a time. The story at first seems to be interesting since it is set between Aliens 2 and 3. Sadly, it is the same old story as in most Aliens games. We have the evil Weyland-Yutani corporation trying to domisticate the Aliens using myriads of innocent people as hosts. One of the Marines gets infected and you will try to save him (You don't need to guess how it turns out). There is some bla bla abou Hicks but you see him first at the intro cutscene and then...well then he will make an appearance. Dunno what exactly will it be since I have to go through 3 more levels to complete the game...wouldn't count on much though.Save your cash, buy only if heavily discounted and when there are other friends you will play it with. It has 3 player co-op campaign. People really paid 60$ on launch for a game that lasts for max 7 hours? Pre-ordered it? Bah...poor guys... "

												Personal Rating: 4 of 10There are many reviews out there stating the game is piled with bugs and crashes your system. I played this recently and encounter no such problem on my machine running on Windows 7 except for a couple of minor bugs.However I cannot rate this game any higher nor recommend it either as it is somewhat dull. Gameplay is very much a generic Run 'n Gun FPS with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ A.I. Graphics are just swell and the sound effect and its track are nothing of the extraordinary. Most of the time you will be accompanied by an AI teammate and he carries a Smart Gun which does not require any ammo but still needs manual aiming. He will empty a couple of rounds towards a container where the enemy is hiding while standing in the open. It is clear that the developers simply increases the damage dealt by the enemies to provide the otherwise zero challenge game. There is this one time when I snuck behind the enemy when he was working on the computer. When he noticed me, he went rampage with hands held high towards other computer and start working on it again.Tonnes of collectible in the game but non provides any fun since you won't be bothered with the story that has no character development. The unique weapons are no different from the standard issue ones except for large clip but it does not come with the upgrades making them useless.Multiplayer is dead so I could not experience it nor try out the co-op gameplay and Aliens.This game was removed from Steam for a period of time and I thought I was lucky to purchased it beforehand but after playing it I wished I was permanently removed even from my library.

												After I played through the game I have to say this is not as bad as it seems from the reviews I read. The game is a typical old school FPS with reasonable graphic. The story is forgettable, I don't really understand how it can be the part of original franchise canon. The NPCs are boring, and you can't really feel the ALIEN atmosphere when you play the game. BUT, after 2 years of the release most of the bugs are fixed, you can find enough challenges in the game and it is an ALIEN FPS. If you can buy it on a sale I truly recommend it! "

												I bought this after the big patch, and at a large discount, so that flavors my review somewhat.  Also, I enjoyed the Alien movies, but I am not bothered about the plot consistencies between the movies and the game.  They are not documentaries, after all.  I am having fun with this, graphics are fine for me, as I don't watch trailers for games or movies, they all tend to give you inflated expectations.  The inane sound bytes from NPCs' are amusing for a bit, then start to get irritating after a while.  The thousandth time I hear 'watch the ceiling'  was about enough.Ran well for me, taken as another space-super marine-save the world shooter, it was fine.  If it hadn't had the iconic tie in, and so much hype,  It would have been a lot better received.*A lot of the people unhappy with this are the poor souls who pre-ordered.  Don't do that, please.  Then they already have your money, and a lot of the pressure to produce is gone, like Early Access. {cough '10 years after ' cough}  I have never went into a car dealership and given them 20 large for next years model before it's built, and I won't do it on a small scale either.

Shooting the aliens is very fun and requires some skill. The game uses checkpoints instead of quicksaves but it works pretty well, all checkpoints are placed just right. I had to repeat some parts (playing on veteran difficulty). But so far it was never unfair. If I died I just got more motivated. This is how a good game should be designed! The graphics are totally ok, after some bad reviews I expected the game to look bad - but it does not! Although I had graphic and AI glitches in some maps.

												4/10""Play this if you're loyal to the franchise as it's not too terribly bad... but I wouldn't buy it unless it was HEAVILY discounted, even then i'd probably prefer it as a gift. If you want a true to the franchise ALIEN game, go get Alien: Isolation, Its wonderful!""Figured that I would make this game my first review that way barely anyone will see it to care about the fact that my opinion of this game differs from mostly everyone who has reviewed this game, as I don't think it's ""that"" bad of a game, although it isn't all that great. As a long-time ""Alien"" franchise fan, I have played any and all games related to this universe that I could ever possibly get my hands on, and that being said, this is not by any means the best game related to the franchise. It has alot of issues that should of been resolved before release, and were completely ignored well after even up until now. I like to say that this game had potential to be on par with Alien Isolation, which I feel it could have been if given the attention that Alien: Isolation got. Sadly, this game got overwhelmed by bad reviews so quickly that noone really cared to even try and fix what was wrong. It saddens me to see what could of been such a great game go to waste, but thankfully we got Alien: Isolation and hopefully they'll use what made it such a great game to give a game like this another try. In conclusion, I'd only buy it if it were heavily discounted and you REALLY REALLY wanted to play it... Otherwise, get Alien: Isolation instead...			"

												""Look up at the stars, and not down at your feet.  Try to make sense of what you see, and wonder about what makes the universe exist.  Be curious."" -Stephen HawkingWithout further delay, here is my review for Aliens: Colonial Marines.Gameplay: Smooth.  Think about that word for a minute.  Then I want you to buy this game, load it up, and watch in awe as that word takes on a whole new meaning.  The action sequences in this game are so tense, one time I accidently flung my mouse into the air and it came crashing down onto my monitor causing me to pay $400 to get a new one.  I would gladly pay double to re-live the experience again.  Watch out for faces in the forest and stay away from the alien spaceship, hehe.  Smooth is not an adequate word to describe the feeling I have in smacking aliens with fluid controls and smooth gameplay. As a famous philosopher once said: ""All roads lead to Rome.""Verdict: I give this 9/10, because it's so smooth. Excellent use of aliens. Good job Gearbox for giving us this amazing game.Note: this game is currently in beta, but that just goes to show you how smooth this game is.***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***			"

												Worst part of the game is the graphics.  In game is nothing, nothing like the pictures on the store.  I knew they would be different, but not so vastly different.  It seems like it is bait advertising.  Thats with maximum settings for everything on a good Nvidia card.  There is an occasional second or two in some of the cut scenes that look like those pictures, but that is it.--------------Single-Player--------------Game is somewhat fun as a very average FPS.  There are worse.  Not many.  The plot is pretty good but there are some moments that conflict with a characters behaviour a short time earlier.I am a huge sci-fi and Alien universe fan which is probably its only true redeeming factor.  If it wasn't Aliens related then I wouldn't pay for this.  As it was I bought it at a very low price.The AI is bad.  Your team-mates are for the most part useless and occasionally a problem.  The enemy alternates between completely hopeless to absolute crack shots.The bugs (software not alien) are bad.  Objects will suddenly appear and dissappear in random locations (e.g a team mate character is in front of you, then suddenly the same one is behind you, and then back in front.  All while you do nothing.)  You can walk through many things.  Aliens and teammates walk through you as well.  There are lots of invisible walls.  The characters aren't animated very well to a scene.-----------Multiplayer-----------Tried it.  Took too long to find a game.  Not sure if it is because of my locality, but that doesn't seem to be a problem with most other games.----------Overall----------This would have been a pretty good game, back in 2006.  There is nothing innovative about it and in fact many things are a step back from other FPS released around the same time.			"

												The game is entertaining enough and gives you the opportunity to live out everyone's fantasy of being a Colonial Marine. Recommend you buy this when it's on sale with the Statis Interrupted DLC, which is a prequal campaign that deals with some plot holes in the main game (the DLC is actually better then the main game, surprise!). None of the other DLC is really worth buying. The game has multiplayer, but there is no active player base so this is pretty much a single player only experience. The 4GB has made the game better since launch, fixing bugs and improving the graphics. The only good thing I can say about this game is that it's a decent enough experience if your a big Aliens fan and want to run around places like the Sulaco or Hadley's Hope.			"

												Worst part of the game is the graphics.  In game is nothing, nothing like the pictures on the store.  I knew they would be different, but not so vastly different.  It seems like it is bait advertising.  Thats with maximum settings for everything on a good Nvidia card.  There is an occasional second or two in some of the cut scenes that look like those pictures, but that is it.--------------Single-Player--------------Game is somewhat fun as a very average FPS.  There are worse.  Not many.  The plot is pretty good but there are some moments that conflict with a characters behaviour a short time earlier.I am a huge sci-fi and Alien universe fan which is probably its only true redeeming factor.  If it wasn't Aliens related then I wouldn't pay for this.  As it was I bought it at a very low price.The AI is bad.  Your team-mates are for the most part useless and occasionally a problem.  The enemy alternates between completely hopeless to absolute crack shots.The bugs (software not alien) are bad.  Objects will suddenly appear and dissappear in random locations (e.g a team mate character is in front of you, then suddenly the same one is behind you, and then back in front.  All while you do nothing.)  You can walk through many things.  Aliens and teammates walk through you as well.  There are lots of invisible walls.  The characters aren't animated very well to a scene.-----------Multiplayer-----------Tried it.  Took too long to find a game.  Not sure if it is because of my locality, but that doesn't seem to be a problem with most other games.----------Overall----------This would have been a pretty good game, back in 2006.  There is nothing innovative about it and in fact many things are a step back from other FPS released around the same time.			"

												Unless you're a fan of the Aliens franchise or just an extra terrestrial enthusiast, I suggest you turn away nowThis game is beyond words. The fact that it has a bug that constantly opens the game up even when you close it to constantly remind you of the mistake you just made. I played single player, the enemies lagged and teleported around. I played online, the enemies lagged and teleported around. I felt more in control of trying not to♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants while having an epileptic seizure while battling irratable bowl syndrome. This game came out 2 years ago but it feels 10 years behind the optimization game. I like the soundtrack. "

												The game is entertaining enough and gives you the opportunity to live out everyone's fantasy of being a Colonial Marine. Recommend you buy this when it's on sale with the Statis Interrupted DLC, which is a prequal campaign that deals with some plot holes in the main game (the DLC is actually better then the main game, surprise!). None of the other DLC is really worth buying. The game has multiplayer, but there is no active player base so this is pretty much a single player only experience. The 4GB has made the game better since launch, fixing bugs and improving the graphics. The only good thing I can say about this game is that it's a decent enough experience if your a big Aliens fan and want to run around places like the Sulaco or Hadley's Hope.			"

												Colonial Marines is a great Alien horror / shooter that has a Doom 3 feel to it.  The levels and settings feel great, and the story isn't terrible.  This game does suffer one thing in particular, and that is one of the worst ally AI's in a game.  It's very possible to have an ally be stuck in the corner of a room while you are facing hordes of deadly aliens that can already be enough of a challenge on it's own.  Probably the only other downside would be a mini boss fight against an Alien Queen that seemed not only lacking, but very vague and unclear on how to fight with the machine it gave you.  As well as the AI that didn't do squat around you.  If it weren't for the AI this would be a great game with awesome story and AI interactions.8/10			"

												This may well be repeating what has been already stated by others, but frankly never has the claim of being faithful and respectful to a franchise been less true with this mess. It may well be a ok playing game, being aggressively mediocre throughout its campaign, but the lack of respect for the material and other just dumb story elements, in some attempt to be relevent to the fans that this so desperately craves, Just makes the whole endeavor for fans of Aliens (including myself) feel more insulting than anything else. A disappointing, and ultimately, wasted effort.			"

												Never have I been so disappointed with a game like I have with Aliens: Colonial Marines. The disappointment is up to par with the ending of Mass Effect 3, which saddens me greatly because I am a huge fan of the Alien franchise. I was extremely happy to see that a canon Aliens game was in the making and after 6 years this pile of junk was released. For people who haven't been up to date with this game you may ask: It can't be that bad, can it?Yes, it can. It IS that bad. With false advertising and the out-sourcing made by Gearbox, this is a product that went completely FUBAR. The graphics are outdated, the game looks incredibly bad and the cut scenes are terrible. The single player story is 5 hours short and stupid (especially the twists). It's also a generic shooter with incredibly bad AI. Your AI teammates keeps missing their shots, shooting into walls AND standing in front of turrets when they shouldn't. They sometimes stop following you and suddenly morph to your location when you reach checkpoints. Even the 3+ gigabyte patch couldn't save this game.What they got right, however, was the Alien queen and the music in the game. The music is actually superb and I was happy that at least SOME Alien-feeling was present in the game since 40 minutes into the game it feels more like a really bad Call of Duty copy. A plus is that you can play co-op campaign, however, it's an easy game so you probably won't have much trouble if you're two (let alone four) playing the game. I also heard that the multiplayer is where the game shines but since I am not into multiplayer I never tried it.This is one of the worst AAA titles that I have ever witnessed. You are better of playing the 1999 Aliens vs Predator game than this one. But it does have co-op and it can bring a few laughs because of the horrible design of the marines and aliens (and the game in general). Don't buy this at full price. Buy it on a -very- cheap sale. You'll thank me.			"

												AHHH, I gave this game a thumb up... I must be mad!? Let me explain how that ""happened"" after all those bad reviews that game received. I did read a lot about that game before I bought it so I was warned and my expectations were, frankly, quite low. I was only interested in the singleplayer-campaign so this small review is all about this, I didn't try coop or multiplayer. I did play the most actual and patched version, so the game may be more stable and slightly more pretty now than the earlier ones most of those bad reviews were about.The game is a straight firstperson-shooter without a good story (how many FPS-games have that anyway?), without state-of-the-art graphics (the game looks like 2006 or 2007, but that is not that much of a surprise considering the long development-time and the aging unreal3-engine which was used) and you have no freedom in movement apart from some rooms the hidden dogtags or legendary weapons are in. But the game is solid! Acceptable atmosphere, a lot of dark places, many many aliens and (yes, to many) human soldiers to shoot at. The music ist nice with strong references to the original soundtracks of ALIEN and ALIENS and the mixture of outside and inside-levels works. I would not call the developers lazy just because a few levels are reused...On the bad side are the forgetable characters (but how many FPS-games have memorable ones?), unoriginal gameplay and weak KI. But on ""hardened"" difficulty the Aliens are quite deadly even being that ""dumb"". All in all this game is by far no masterpiece and the licence is capable of much more. But for a weekend it IS ok and worth a few hours.			"

												Aliens: Colonial Marines was had a rough time. It was panned by the critics and decimated by the public. Despite this (and because I love Aliens so much), I decided to give the game a fair shot and go into it open minded. At first, I was really enjoying the game, it's atmosphere, the sound design of the classic weapons, and... well that was about it. It was a lot of fun fighting the aggressive xenomorphs but the plot takes a crazy turn and you end up fighting humans for a large, almost half, of the time. It was a decent shot, but the game just couldn't keep my interest. The checkpoint system isn't the best, which makes the cheap, almost instant deaths when fightning the humans with guns a whole lot worse. Sadly, I didn't bother to finish the game's campaign. I loved the first couple hours, and there are a few great moments scattered about after that, but just not enough.2.5/5			"

But I can't.It's a clunky, extraordinarily average and generic shooter with an Aliens skin. There is some nice fan service here and there, like visiting Hadly's Hope and seeing all the sights from the movie, which are very well done from a design point of view. But the game feels really sluggish, the shooting mechanics are boring, and the entire campaign is extremely linear, and STILL buggy after two years.If it was on sale, maybe consider it. But this is really poor form for Gearbox.			"

												Pro:-Fun time playing with friends in the campaign-True to the franchise, locations, weapons etc.-Weapon collectables and upgrades-Has been updated enough to be enjoyableCons:-No one plays multiplayer matches, no one.-Story is basic, can even predict what happens at times.-NPCs warp ahead of you to objectives.-Character cameo was done poorly.-Not the best graphics, even when it came out.-Not particularly long, terrible ending and not many reasons to come back to it.Game is not worth its full price. If it goes on sale for less than $5 and you play with friends in the campaign its worth the low price, maybe. "

												Aliens colonial Marines was one of the worst experiences I've ever had with a video game my experiences with a friend of mine didn't help much because he was suicidal most of the time running into the Weyland Yutani for the main enemies in this game not you know aliens but other than that yes the game was so boring it it just felt six hours it was was not what it felt like it felt like 6 months the game started off with you Hicks and a friend with Bella the marine and O'Neill I can't remember their names very well because they don't help not once did they ever helped us if you go down they don't revive you but anyways I don't really know the story of the of the game because it was it was basically no story you're on a ship you go to the alien homeworld the women attorneys there and it turns out the Weyland Yutani have control of the mother and Leander whatever you got to go see if Marines as well so let everything that happens game 6 hours and 40 have a review out by the end of the week can I put 22 s 3 dollars $6 I don't know much about $3 I'll have to review out next week so yeah don't buy it			"

												There is not much really to add to this game that hasn't already been said. So this is simply a testament that all thenegative things you heard aboput this game is true. It is not only the game and its mechanics that are poorly done, it is also how they have handled the source material and how they seem to have missed all the extended universe material already out there. The game itself is a mess between a bad shooter that feels very dated and sloppy. The ""feel"" simply isn't there and the immersion is totally broken since you at any time can swap weapons, get notices about upgrades and whatnots.The aliens are usually straight chargers and the only scary bit is if you sometimes miss one of them popping up out of the blue. This game is so bad, it isn't even fun in a bad way. It is a shame they released this game and it is IMO a shame what they tried to do to teh ALIENS storyline.Fans deserved better.			"

												Honestly at this point I'm sure most everyone has seen the reviews but still, stay far away from this game. The full entirety of the singleplay game is not only poorly designed but also poorly written, and its garbage in every sense of the word. The multiplayer could maybe hold your attention for an hour, but its mediocre at best and not worth the price of admission. Combined with bad graphics, bad sound design, and bland gameplay and you got yourself a disapointment.			"

												First off, I need to say this: I'm not a hardcore aliens fan.But I do love that franchise.This said, this game is very bipolar when it comes to itself; there are moments where you will curse its name for being so stupideasy, so cliché, so linear, so... everything that can be wrong with a game, really, save crashing.And then, there will be moments that you will ask yourself ""Who made this section and why weren't they in charge of the entire bloody game? This is FANTASTIC."".And then, there will be a few moments, far between, where you'll nearly♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants in fear and/or surprise.There isn't much to say about ACM that hasn't been said before; the way I like to say it is that it's a game of extremes.What it does well, it does extremely well and what it does wrong, it makes an epic failure out of it.The story is nice, but cookie-cutter.The humans are just a big ""WHY did you think this would be a good idea?"" question for the developer.The graphics are okay at best.The co-op is amazing.The AI is completely stupid.Multiplayer is well thought out.The game is way too easy.The ending is a HUGE letdown.I don't care that you're saying ""there will be more in DLCs""; I didn't pay to have the right to a DLC! I paid to get a game.And with 4-5 hours worth of single/coop play, I shouldn't have to pour more money in this thing.The savings grace?I played this game on day 1 with a friend of mine who's a HUGE Aliens fan and we were both new to the game. He made the experience completely worthwhile.So, unless you have a friend who's a huge fan of the franchise and never played the game and wants to play with you (and 2 other friends), don't really bother with this game. Otherwise, do it. Best fun and laughs you'll have had in a long time.			"

												IF the game was more honest about itself and was released years ago then it would of been an ok game.  The fact the press demos was sooooo much better then what we truely got and the Alien AI was garbage for what they were suppose to be makes this game bad.  I can not recomend this to even a casual player of these games cause some games that have mods for Aliens in them play better.P.S. The game time I have is what it took to beat it strolling casually in it.  So rushed I could of pulled it in 3 hours.			"

												Never have I been so disappointed with a game like I have with Aliens: Colonial Marines. The disappointment is up to par with the ending of Mass Effect 3, which saddens me greatly because I am a huge fan of the Alien franchise. I was extremely happy to see that a canon Aliens game was in the making and after 6 years this pile of junk was released. For people who haven't been up to date with this game you may ask: It can't be that bad, can it?Yes, it can. It IS that bad. With false advertising and the out-sourcing made by Gearbox, this is a product that went completely FUBAR. The graphics are outdated, the game looks incredibly bad and the cut scenes are terrible. The single player story is 5 hours short and stupid (especially the twists). It's also a generic shooter with incredibly bad AI. Your AI teammates keeps missing their shots, shooting into walls AND standing in front of turrets when they shouldn't. They sometimes stop following you and suddenly morph to your location when you reach checkpoints. Even the 3+ gigabyte patch couldn't save this game.What they got right, however, was the Alien queen and the music in the game. The music is actually superb and I was happy that at least SOME Alien-feeling was present in the game since 40 minutes into the game it feels more like a really bad Call of Duty copy. A plus is that you can play co-op campaign, however, it's an easy game so you probably won't have much trouble if you're two (let alone four) playing the game. I also heard that the multiplayer is where the game shines but since I am not into multiplayer I never tried it.This is one of the worst AAA titles that I have ever witnessed. You are better of playing the 1999 Aliens vs Predator game than this one. But it does have co-op and it can bring a few laughs because of the horrible design of the marines and aliens (and the game in general). Don't buy this at full price. Buy it on a -very- cheap sale. You'll thank me.			"

												Dont buy this at all in full Retail Price, save your money. Only get this if its on a steam sale. I would recomend that you should spend $7 or less on this.  This game had potential but  Gearbox outsourced most of this game while they where busy with Borderland 2 and Sega failed BIG time to keep an eye on this release. When the game first came out it was buggy as hell. Your AI teamates just stand there while Aliens eat you to pieces.  The only saving grace is that Multiplay is somewhat fun and Single Player Coop drop in or out.  Singleplay campain is meh also short like 5 hrs to 6 this is on hard mode by the way.  As an Alien Fan you might enjoy this. I did, for example the Aliens sound just like in the movies with their hissing and whines. The good old motion detector was always fun/cool to use. It was pretty disapointing in what Gearbox promised to release, when this came out. Just search a youtube comparison of Gearbox Aliens Colnial Marines Demo video and compare it to the released one. You'll see a huge diference and why this was a big let down.Again Only get this on the cheap and if your looking for another Aliens fix, this game is just that. Im not saying that the gameplay is crappy, shooting Aliens is fun, but it was a big let down.  The game  Aliens vs Predator made by Rebellion plays and looks better then this game and it came out 2010, now that tells you something right there.Update: Also only grab the dlc on the cheap too.  The new singleplayer DLC Stasis Interrupted campain is slightly better but not worth full price in my opinion, so get that on sale as well.			"

												It's been a while since a hotly anticipated game has eventually received as much flak as Aliens: Colonial Marines. And yeah, the game's admittedly not that great. Somewhat dated graphics, very basic run-and-gun/hunt-the-switch mechanics and AI issues could not stop me from occasionally actually enjoying the game, however. I especially liked the initial bits in Hadley's Hope, which were quite atmospheric. But let's be honest - The game doesn't really stand on its own, and holds together just because of the strength of the Aliens franchise. I wouldn't recommend the game at full price, but it's a decent enough diversion if you get it cheap.			"

												After the first few nerve racking scenerios it does improve.  For 5 Buck it is recommended.  Stays nerve racking but I think that tones down some also.  I'd give it a 6 out of 10 stars.   I think there is noticeable improvement in your overall ability to survive as you level and I would not say it is merely skill related.  It eventually gives you a reasonable variaty of missions which keeps it interesting.  I think the tracking device need an instruction manual.  It might be obvious to some perhaps but it doesn't seem to make sense to me.  I often seem to walk all around without spotting a thing and when I'm right on top of it.  It usually jumps me from somewhere.  It is annoying that with every hit you have to find the target before you can even fire.  Basically disorients you in the game as well depending on the person I'm sure.  It picked up though so I cant complain.			"

If you want a good review on the game visit a large majority of the Review sites.This game was completed in less then 6 hours on hard.There are better games out there. This almost feels like a Halo Nock off. With aliens always attacking it give you the feeling that your playing Alien Swarm in first person. You really don't do much except for travel down corridor's and shoot the aliens that keep popping up out infront of you. There is a motion tracker like in the movie but you can't use a pistol and the motion tracker at the same time. There are just to many issues and bugs with the game to honestly say its worth the money.			"

												Aliens: Colonial marines will appeal only to diehard fans of the franchise and even then that demographic of gamers may feel insulted with this purchase. Multiplayer is truly the redeeming factor, but a dwindling community consisting of only double digits at best; makes this a questionable buy. The feeling overall was best described as ""I feel like a close friend has died...""			"

												There is not much really to add to this game that hasn't already been said. So this is simply a testament that all thenegative things you heard aboput this game is true. It is not only the game and its mechanics that are poorly done, it is also how they have handled the source material and how they seem to have missed all the extended universe material already out there. The game itself is a mess between a bad shooter that feels very dated and sloppy. The ""feel"" simply isn't there and the immersion is totally broken since you at any time can swap weapons, get notices about upgrades and whatnots.The aliens are usually straight chargers and the only scary bit is if you sometimes miss one of them popping up out of the blue. This game is so bad, it isn't even fun in a bad way. It is a shame they released this game and it is IMO a shame what they tried to do to teh ALIENS storyline.Fans deserved better.			"

												I'm a big fan of the Alien movies.  I bought Aliens: Colonial Marines knowing that I was getting it just for the campaign, the back story, and all the love of the movies the developers put into the game.  I got out of it what I expected, but I would not recommend it for anyone but a big fan of the movies.  The single player campaign is ok, but not great.  There is not as much love for the movies in this as I expected, and there are some inconsistencies in the story.  Some of the dialog is unintentionally funny.  I didn't give multiplayer a try, so I won't comment on that.			"

												A turgid mess. For all it's sins as played out by the media I really enjoyed Duke Nukem Forever and saw a lot I like, from the combat mechanics to the level design. I can't say the same thing about Colonial Marines. The biggest issue is the lie Gearbox produced about them being 100% dedicated to the Aliens franchise lore. They outsourced the game to a lesser experienced budget game developer whilst stating they were the ones working on it. As well as putting out footage of a game that didn't exist whilst promoting it. The story is terrible, with some of the worst an level writing I have ever witnessed. The AI for the aliens is horrible. They will get stuck on walls, stand still in front of you and do nothing at times or just come barreling toward you down a corridor and straight into your pulse rifle. Saying that, it doesn't seem as bad as you'll spend most the game fighting human mercs anyway. In fact you spend more time fighting humans than Aliens in an Aliens game. Go figure. The game had 1 redeeming section which was the Hadleys Hope area where you could walk around the movies set but in context of the films canon it doesn't make any sense for it to still be standing. I will never take this game as canon because doing so requires to many stupid leapes of faith and coincidinces over explained film lore. Horrible game that Gearbox  should be more worried will damage their repuation than Duke Nukem ever would.EDIT: Upon viewing the store page there are still screenshots being used from the early E3 demo that the game looks nothing like. Absolute false advertising of this trash game.			"

												I hate to have to agree with everybody and their mother, but I can't help it.I bought the game for $2, thinking it couldn't possibly be so bad it's not worth that kind of money. After giving the single player a try (and that's all I did, since I'm not into multiplayer), I honestly have to say that I'm not entirely convinced it was worth even two dollars for me.The graphics are okay, the sound design is quite good, and the atmosphere is all right, too, if you don't focus on the alien's animations and weird behavior too much (which can be a challenge) - but the actual gameplay was so bland and the shooting so uninspired that all in all, I had no fun playing whatsoever (me being terribly bad at this game didn't help much either, though).

												The short: Feces. The long: After playing CA's excellent Alien: Isolation to 100% I expected a painful experience but not this bad. I did not have hype for it at release because Gearbox's Borderlands 1 I found boring, extremely repetitive and underwhelming by the end. This game however is an embrassment to game design, the fans of the series and consumers. How someone says that this is a good buy on sale even with the patches is beyond me. It broke Steam by restarting the program everytime my friend and I tried to quit. It kept restarting for me even after restarting Steam and completely restarting my PC. Not more than three missions in during coop it gave my friend the Blue Screen of Death. After that we had enough, we both uninstalled it and refuse to acknowledge its existance. Screw you Gearbox & Randy ""Liar Extraordinaire"" Pitchford for dragging our PCs and one of our favorite franchises through the mud. It will take a mountain of good games to want something of yours again.			"

												Do you remember that scene in Alien Resurrection where a failed Ripley clone is begging to be killed? That's what this game made me feel like.This is a prefect example of what happens when you take a great IP, and squeeze out a lazy cash-grab game concept. The only thing more offensive then it's terrible game-play, lazy level design, horrible AI, fan-fiction grade writing and the least likeable squad mate in recent gaming history is that it's considered Alien cannon. The xenomorphs are stupid and never pose a real threat. There's almost no tension at any point in the game. It feels like a checklist of things that had to be included into an FPS were lazily thrown tacked on. Oh and you fight humans for half the game. Go ahead, re-read that sentence, at least half of the combat in Aliens Colonial Marines is against other humans.The only things this game got right were art direction and sound direction. It fails at literally everything else.Like- It looks like an Aliens product-It sounds like an Aliens productDislikes-EVERY THING ELSETLRD: It's terrible, go play classic AvP instead.			"

												I hardly ever recommending avoiding a game however for this scummy croc of♥♥♥♥♥♥game I have no option but to!This game has made me lose faith in everything it represents. Alien franchise, Marines, Gaming AI, Gaming as a whole, FPS, Sci Fi games, Space games, any kind of game ever!Okie so maybe I wouldn't hang up my gaming gloves and resort to watching two and a half men on repeat as I eat chips off my chest and let my dog lick peanut butter off my nuts yet. (which I imagine the makers of this game started doing as soon as they were fired for making this ""game"")I strongly STRONGLY advise anyone and everyone to avoid this game. Even if it's on sale! I wouldn't pay £1 or even $1 to own this game if I had the chance to again. If I were able to go back to a time where I was much happier and the thought of Alien didn't make me want to end my life and scream to this newer happier Alex ""NOOOOO DON'T DO IT!"" at the risk of causing a time paradox where I end up going out to some sleazy house party at a crack den and contracting Aids instead, then I would be building that time machine right now!!

												I bought this game a week ago when it was on sale along with AVP, and let me be the last to say, this game sucks. In fact, it is in the worst state it has ever been in right now.If you are looking to buy this game for the multiplayer, DO NOT BUY! Barely anyone plays this game anymore, and for modes like Team Deathmatch, it seems to require all slots in order to play, which is near impossible at this time. I was lucky to see one person show up. Also, the co-op online campain is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t too. If you are looking to play a specific level on a specific difficulty, good luck my friend. To this date I have never found anyone show up to play with me after several attempts. This is very disappointing because I was really looking forward to the multiplayer modes this game had to offer. The campaign is not nearly enough to justify the purchase. The AI is crap, especially for your assigned partners when you play offline, and the death screens are just confusing. Sure, there are some fun sections to be had in the game. Such areas include using the smart gun for 5 minutes, finding legendary weapons, and the great survival horror level near the middle of the game.Overall, what am I telling you that you haven't already heard for the past two years? This game sucks, and now it sucks more than ever. I feel robbed even at a discounted price. If you want a good marine game that is shorter, try AVP. It is cheaper and a much better experience than A:CM. If you are big into survival horror, Alien Isolation masters it, check that one out.			"

You could have made this game with the Sulacco (the best part of the game) and had it dock automated on a station and then the station got infected. You could have made a story that made sense. There's no reason to go back to Haley's Hope, which would have been wiped off the map with the massive explosion of the Atmosphere Processor that went thermo-nuclear at the end of Aliens. It makes even LESS sense that the Atmosphere Processor itself still exists.The game just doesn't make sense, and is boring. What a waste.			"

												This is one of those titles that I found more enoyable on PC than on console.  Although it still isn't the game that was originally shown and yes we were all misled, its far from ""Worst Game ever"".In the PC version the Aliens have a better AI and I find myself dying a lot even on the easiest difficuly, the Aliens now climb up walls and ceilings and sometimes they sneak up on you (None of this is in the console version)The graphics while not the best I've seen, they make the game feel like the movie its based off, and there's a lot of authenticty here, so there's no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ""Exclusions"" or retcons to the story here.While I do admit the inclusion of shooting humans is somewhat strange given the source material, however shooting Aliens would have evemntually gotten boring pretty quickly, so in a way I'm happy human enemies are in this game, but I do agree that they should have only been in one or two levels.One thing that would have made this game great is an Alien campaign, as cool as it is to rev up that Pulse Rifle, it'd be nice to see things from their side for a change.AVOID the console version.Pros: Shooting feels satisfying, Alien AI is much improved over the console versions, authentic throughout, Pulse Rifles Cons: Still suffers on the visuals, no Alien Campaign, lack luster end boss fight.

I didn't get to play this game at release but I almost wish I had because it seems most of the hilarious bugs I heard about have been patched out.  When a game is this bad, why not just leave them in?  I'll probably finish the game anyway, it's only a few hours long and by gosh I'm going to find a way to make this game worth the two dollars I paid for it.  If anyone should ever see this review who may be on the verge of buying this game because you love the movies:  it's okay not to buy it.  Trust me.  Please.  You don't need it.  It's not worth it.

												Bought this under the 75% off sale, played it through ultimate badass first time round then uninstalled it upon completion.Sadly, A:CM is unrecommended for playing due to the fact that, there are some areas in the game which makes you wonder what the game designers were thinking when coming up with concepts of boss fights, areas to defend and really mundane level design. The worst part is objectives involving humans, there is more human combat than xenos. The AI is bad, by that I mean you can just locate the way points and headshot pretty much anything. The fight with the Raven vs you in a powerloader has to be one of the worst midboss fights ever played, really just involves spamming the left mouse, no means of skill involved. As for the final queen boss fight, well it was a waste of time. Again on the AI side, the game includes a marine to follow you about, this kind of eliminates the fear factor, you are with a meatshield that can not die. Though does fractional damage to the Xenos and pretty much a useless AI to have around, shame that cant be disabled as it's part of this story which again is weak.Another annoyance is the scripted events and switch pressing animations, really not needed yet it becomes fustrating when you are told to pull a lever whilst you are under attack, though yes you will get hit whilst stuck in these animations.The graphics, models and character animations have a 2009 era feel to them.Looking beyond these mishaps there is some nice settings, the view of LV426 is nice, the weapons are sound and it is a lot of fun getting to use Colonial Marine weapons, shame the Smartgun is seen as a special gun than a weapon you can carry about with you.Pros- Nice settings of the game(LV426)- Get to use Colonial Marine weapons- Recommended for play in Ultimate Badass mode only to get the best experience (warning Raven boss fight in this mode will be fustrating!)Cons- Multiplayer is now non-existant (bad rep for this game has buried it)- Single player plot sucks/Characters are boring, no character depth (It will get annoying when you keep hearing the characters during the fmv sequences saying ""We dont leave marines behind"" ok I get it!)- Invisible barriers in areas where you could possibly investigate- Scripted Events and Animations for certain pressing/pulling switches- Poor/annoying boss fights- Poor AI - Not scary! :(General Zod's Final VerdictIt is a♥♥♥♥♥♥game but! best it to get it on a sale ie 75% or even better 90% off if it ever happens, the game is a half baked attempted at an Aliens game but just misses the mark completely. A:CM does deliver well on the marine weapons which are fun to use and I think thats it's only selling point it has now, I would have priased the weapons more but the Smartgun has been deprived from the marine's arsenal as a special weapon which is a real shame, would have loved to have used it more! There are some scary moments(sewers level) but only lasts for about 15mins after that its gone.You are better off playing AvP2010 as the graphics on that are a lot better and the Xenos on there will give you a better fight.

												Ok so Aliens: Colonial Marines conception was a bit rocky, we had the years of would it? wont it?  yes? no? then we had a demo that for all intents and purposes burned that acidic hole through our hearts... like we always wanted from an Aliens game... Yes Aliens: CM was THE game to make us feell like Hicks, Hudson, Ripley, Vasquez etc.... and yes I know we got a burn that wasn't as acidic as we all hoped for... the game wasn't as it was supposed to be on the demo... but tell me what game truly is? and with SEGA involved are you really that surprised? but none the less... this game despite such a shady birth... and homecoming...this game does actually bring things to the franchise that, other Aliens games do not...Attention to detail for one.... the level design, especially on the Sulaco and LV-426 for example, the detail is phenomenal, you can actually walk round the level and recognize parts of where Ripley, Newt and the Marines were and where Hudson took his final stand before being ripped under the floor... you can see the previously welded doors where they made their escape... everything left where it was when they left... even on the Sulaco... the downed Dropship, abandoned APC, and Crawler..... its all there... yes there are bugs (pardon the pun) but there is a lot of enjoyment this game has to offer too.. and a lot of support by the community.. you may have heard ""oh dont play this game you can fight hoards of Xeno's without worrying about taking damage.... it just doesn't feel difficult!""ok I hear that and raise you the SurvivalV2 mod, found here http://www.moddb.com/mods/aliens-survival-experience/downloads/survival-experience-v2 changes the pulse rifle to 95 rounds fully auto... use clip extension to put to 99, adds movie damage and changes fire rate & damage for Smart Gun and Sentry Guns, also adds Xeno damage consistant with Movies... ACID actually hurts.... no health regen... get spat on or someone shoots a xeno near u and it explodes next to u your armour is gone... more details found on the site....the Bug Hunt mode also a great addition, and a missed opportunity to be fair, but still a great addition... but yes I know you are going to complain about the Mercs, again simple solution turn em off... http://www.moddb.com/mods/aliens-survival-experience/downloads/no-more-mercs-lurkers-onlyno-dino-headsweldthis mod removes the Mercs, allows the lurkers, tries to take off the dino head xeno's but doesn't.. no mercs part and weld/cut doors....can create choke points with this which can add more intensity to the games... also there is a mod to replace the Mercs with Boilers.... all these and the graphics mods available all done via the modding community... and might I add without the SDK so far... you have to admit once you try or even retry the game that they add far far more and make the experience so much more I highly recommend giving this game a chance... as many reviews or oppinions around will be so final, and damning do your selves a favour... try it your selves if you dont want to pay much for a copy try it on http://www.play.com/Games/PC/4-/5233983/Aliens-Colonial-Marines-Limited-Edition/Product.html?searchstring=aliens+colonial+marines&searchsource=0&searchtype=gameall&urlrefer=search&strefer=gameall&searchfilters=s%7baliens+colonial+marines%7d%2bc%7b362%7d%2b at least you can say what's a couple of £ happy hunting people :)  "

												The game is really bad.  The enemy AI is some of the worst I have ever seen.  I didn't get to play this game at release but I almost wish I had because it seems most of the hilarious bugs I heard about have been patched out.  When a game is this bad, why not just leave them in?  I'll probably finish the game anyway, it's only a few hours long and by gosh I'm going to find a way to make this game worth the two dollars I paid for it.  If anyone should ever see this review who may be on the verge of buying this game because you love the movies:  it's okay not to buy it.  Trust me.  Please.  You don't need it.  It's not worth it.  Just walk away.			"

												Cleared this on hardened offline, would have been more enjoyable if the game was polished.-The lack of godframes is astonishing, get killed without even being able to do anything.-All weapons aside the shotguns are useless, accuracy is undeniably bad on every rifles aside the semi-auto and even this one fails at time.-AI on your team would be okay if their weapons could do actual damage. Might as well just do the lone soldier gameplay.-Graphics are decent, for 2012 that is still quite low. Screenshots feels like a lie.-Buggy mechanics and prop collisions. AI shooting tru small or right above the pixel of your head behind cover is really annoying.-Can't freaking close the game unless i force it.-Checkpoints and scripts repetition was annoying.Ain't gonna recommend this, most likely gonna cause a rage fest for all players. Yet still have to try versus, which looks interesting, but with that nightmare on campaign, it might just be the same disappointment on gameplay.			"

												I've had my heart broken several times in my life. Once, on Christmas Day 1989, I eagerly ran downstairs and gasped at the sight of what was clearly a crudely but lovingly wrapped skateboard. A skateboard that I had wanted ever since I had seen Marty McFly cruise through the streets of Hill Valley as a stowaway behind an unsuspecting SUV driver. A skateboard with a custom deck, with artwork that would cause my fellow skaters to shout ""rad"". A skateboard whose wheels would send me gliding across the streets as I headed for the nearest half-pipe. A skateboard of majestical proportion.I grabbed it, and with shaking hands and a heart beating against my chest, I tore that festive wrapping as hard as I could. Through an intricate web of sticky tape, ribbon and ever expanding wrapping paper, I dug through. Years later, I wondered that this is what Andy in The Shawshank Rdemption must have felt like as he dragged hinself through the tunnels. My own redemption was in sight. My prize was near. Finally, the last shred of packaging fell away to the floor. And there it was... a plastic skateboard from the local store. With stiff plastic wheels. And a picture of a clown on the deck. That's what playing Aliens: Colonial Marines felt like.			"

												Stay Awhile, Stay Forever.So, not only is this game buggy as hell, it also doesn't let you quit.  Quitting the game causes it to reload as soon as it closes.  The fact that this game was even released in this condition is a testament to the total failure of everyone on this project.  I can only hope they never work in this industry again.			"
