Boring, Repetitive, Broken Gameplay. Avoid this. 1/10 This game looks like it would be okay from the store, but it's not, it's actually awful. I can't tell anyone to buy a game that will have no enjoyment, and is completely broken. The graphics are actually pretty good, I'll admit that, but the gameplay is terrible. There is nothing user friendly about the game, the interface is off putting, and the controls are so bad. Rotating the camera, which you'll have to do often is annoying, and the game is still buggy.The gameplay is boring, it's frustrating and everything is repetative. You will have to lure out zombies, and either melee them, or lure them into a trap. It is completely boring. I will admit I haven't played through a lot of the game, but this is because there is no reason to do this. I've had the game crash, I've had my inventory disappear, I've had no fun whatsoever.			"

												Simply put. BAD *smacks the developers hands* BAD! Look what you did! This is a HORRIBLE game full of bugs and bad mechanics. From randomly taking damage to characters who are not bleeding nor have zombies around them in any way shape or form to what can only be described as desyncing multiplayer.  The multiplayer does NOT make up for this horrible game because you and your teammate will simply not be playing the same game. Doors they open will not open for you and vice versa which does not mean either of you are safe because you will simply be killed by zombies you dont see but your friend will.  God I could go on and on about this horrible game but read the forums there isnt a single good review about this game even if it were heavily discounted.			"

												This isn't the kind of zombie-strategy based game i was expecting for... it's... just generic.I may be an obtuse to ask things, like:""Why there are few characters to control in this game?""Well, a zombie pandemic is a zombie pandemic, everyone turns mad, making others mad as well, and few people remain ""Why, having already few units to control, they can carry only 4-5 things?""Well, every human being can carry only few things, even the strongest ones. They aren't pack mules.""Why a single map can be very long, and, probably, you will broke it, rendering your attempts to end in vain?""That's a good question, for the not obtuse people. Really, it isn't sarcastic, i think i just broke the level at the third mission, discovered that nearly at the end of the map, and now i should play it from the start, because i can't complete it. But that should be just my problem, nothing to do with you others.Let's say, this game is boring, because it's a predictable game: the zombies come, you run, you kill them in the way while keeping at a distance from them, then you run again, and so on... Or maybe it's just me that i find tactical zombie games like that. But anyway, for me the gameplay seems too clunky, along with the bad controls and reaction of the characters, which make the game very frustrating.Also to note, the Multiplayer Co-op it's HORRIBLE:  first you need to do a port forward in your router if you're using one to access the internet, then you can play the levels that, in case you are the host, you have completed, with the same items you had before starting. Your friends will be stuck with your stuff, sometimes getting even confused if you're not a tidy guy. If you want to play more than 2 players, you can't play the first levels with them, because the characters are pretty few, like i said. After these little problems, here comes the gameplay on multiplayer.There aren't the dialogue of the characters in the map, to understand some parts of the storyline in the game. Also, your guests that entered in your game may be experiencing lots of lag, for some strange reason, in casual moments, even if they have a good computer. And that will make it unplayable until they will left it.This game is poorly cared by the developers, and, i might be too harsh about this, maybe because, i repeat, this kind of games are boring for me, maybe because i am not much into strategy games, fighting against some slow creatures... but this game, is pretty bad, and not worth it's cost. Not even if it's on sale, for me. Not even in a bundle. Well, maybe for the cards, if you have interest in it.			"

												This is easily one of the worst zombie-themed games I've ever played.Supposedly, developers tried to make something like a squad-based survival simulator. The final product is not a simulator, it's not about surviving (if we're not talking about user surviving through the UI), and squad-based part is just pontless.Every aspect of the game represents raw incompetence of the developers -- game is bugged, UI is ridiculous, gameplay is extremely boring (if you'll last more than 1 hour, like I did, you're supposed to be awarded with a medal), fighting system is just plainly lame.The game has active pause (you can prace Space to pause the game and give orders to your survivors). Presumably, this was implemented to introduce tactics to the game. Alas, this effort was fruitless -- fights are boring and repetitive. Most of the fights are ending up in user, luring enemies into some trap and then activating it. There's no tactics to it, honestly, it's just a waste of time.There's a ton of useless mechanics. For example, your character can randomly start bleeding after he was wounded. You'll be bleeding for the whole duration of the level (it won't stop), yet you won't lose any HP for that. Why was that implemented? Because it attracts zombie in a bigger radius around you. But since you're walking faster then they do, they'll soon forget about you and would roam around their location aimlessly (pathfinding is awful here too, by the way).The weapon system is plainly lame -- you can only hold 1 weapon, and if you want to turn on some switch, you first have to hide the weapon, then use the switch, then take out the weapon again. Developers couldn't care less about usability, I think.One of the bugs that I've found in my short session was inability to launch game in windowed mode -- all my efforts lead to a point where my inventory disappeared alongside with all of the texts in the game. I was unable to fix it, so, obviously enough, I've decided to just uninstall.Will I recommend this game? Never. I may recommend to try it to people with really low self-esteem that are enjoying UI masochism and poor gameplay.I'd rate the game 2.0 out of 10.0, and would NOT recommend it to anyone.			"

												5-Star Fail. Clearly, this game was released before being fully developed. It is pretty bad on a lot of levels. The maps and graphics overall are actually decent but that's about it. It isn't fun or rewarding at all, just clunky and buggy. Enjoyment only came from laughing at how bad it is, and gaining extra disk space when uninstalling.			"

												Would have been a really fun game if it weren't for those pesky non-responsive controls! I'm trying to run but it makes me walk. I'm supposed to auto-hit but it switches to manual hitting. I try to save but it magically makes me go down a path that doesn't exist and then I get stuck? All of these technical problems really killed the game for me. I gave it a fair shot but not a single bullet hit a bulls-eye, let alone an actual target. You'll definitely feel helpless and trapped dead with the awful controls.			"

												Zombie genre... raised on love of fear and cliches, which makes you shiver and comfortable at one time.So, this particular example, ""Trapped Dead"", is a top-down tactical game in real time. It is no shooter, neither action like ""Diablo"", where all you need is to click faaaster. There you have to advance slowly, be ready to run backward, count every bullet, and killing zombies one-by-one. Flawlessly, if possible, because if they get you only a scratch , you will bleed, and that will attract many more undeads... You gonna need some skill with controls, certainly.Most of the reviews on Steam are negative, for typical reasons: people who bought the game wasn't ready for it.1) it is slow-paced and needs patience and tactical thinking much more than quick-reflexes2) it can be buggy, at least in some cases, as I see. I suppose that somewhat portraying basic user who dislike that game - a schoolboy with weak PC and without skills to tune it and patience to simply let it go. Me personally, never had any serious trouble, maybe freeze one or two times when I alt-tabbed game for couple of hours on the office PC with built-in video... On the normal systems with up-to-date software it runs fine.For me, the only real down-side was lack of ammo. It is so cliche, you know...So! I do recommend that game, but only if you ready to beat zombies with melee weapons at slow-paced tactical game with controls like in ""command&conquer"". Story is basic enough - get a team, get a supplies, find a way out.Not a bad game overall, nothing fancy, but deserves 7/10 mark. Just not suited for impatient schoolboys.			"

												A frustrating but overall nice turn-based/real-time strategy/RPG hybrid game.The gameplay is very similar to Icewind Dale. You get to control a party of survivors in real-time, however you can pause the game at any moment to choose what should be that character's next action.The action is very intense as you can often become overcrowded with dozens of zombies in just a mere few seconds. The feeling of the weapons, from baseball bats, pistols, to even grenades is perfect. Letting a zombie to slowly walk right up to your character's face to finally blow his/her brains out with a well timed shot is deliciously rewarding. The game world, characters and zombies are all well designed, but the voice acting is atrocious. The game is well presented, the graphics are good, but the camera system can be extremely frustrating to control at times. Getting used to the poor camera system and controls can be a hard task.The game uses a checkpoint system to save your progress during missions, but they're quite rare and some checkpoints are optional. These are often placed in an alternate route and protected by a bunch of zombies. While the checkpoint system builds up tension and greatly increases the challenge, it only leads to frustration because you can easily loose an hour of gameplay if the game crashes (and it does often in some missions).I would recommend to buy a 4-pack when on sale (or even better, get it in a 1 dollar bundle) to play with your friends because playing solo can be VERY tiring as you'd have to micro-manage everything.There's no achievements in this game.

												I don't understand either why all the negative reviews. This never locked up on me, but there's a part when you end the level that you THINK it does. What they forget to tell you is that you have to click the individual characters you want to go to the next level. If you don't clikc them, the game stays where it's at and you assume it's a bug. Great evnireonments, sound, music, gameplay. If you like strategy and zombies, this needs to be in oyur collection. And how is it possible you can go wrong at this low price???? COME ON!!!			"

												The characters dont move with any urgency in their movements so they end up casually stroling up to zombies and instead of hitting the zombies as fast as they can like their lives depended on it, and the zombies, more often than not, get a first swing in every time they see you coming.Also the controls are counter intuitive, for instance you have to equip a weapon and right click to use it but for some reason when you equip a med kit to stop bleeding you have to left click.I didn't even get through the second level before quiting this game because of how often some stupid thing would come up.So yeah, Dont buy this game			"

IF you have a coupon if you get it on sale then MAYBE it is a fair buy at 50 cent. They need to put in some quests and character development.

Score: 1/5; I do not recommend Trapped DeadPC; Win 10 64-bit; Trapped Dead v1.1.0.0uncompleted; playing time: 3 hrsPros:+ an interesting beginning of the game at the gas station, promising an engrossing continuation+ noteworthy mechanics of presenting the stages of the plot Cons:- controls are rather annoying; you have to use the keyboard to move the camera- there are no settings - no audio or video settings..., nothing...- most importantly, the game won't run; I tried to run it several times and most of the times it wouldn't run; I managed to only run it twice- above all, Trapped Dead caused my computer to reset several times; this is the first time that any game on Steam has done so, which makes it worthy of a negative review...All in all, I suggest avoiding this game. Although the setting and the presentation seem interesting (provided you actually manage to run the game), Trapped Dead clearly suffers from serious technical problems which go far beyond its pesky controls or even lack of any settings. Due to the risk of accidental resets, it is likely to be dangerous to your computer, putting your computer file integrity at risk. It's a crying shame as, in my opinion, the game has got great potential...			"

												I'm tired of seeing this game get such bad press. If you like zombie apocalypse games based on old '70s or '80s films or comics then you'll probably like this one. Mind you, its not perfect; its a bit too short, the controls are a bit wonky, and the voice acting is just terrible, but it satisfies a need for zombie mayhem and the all important retribution against said zombies. Blast one up close with a shotgun with the wheel-chair bound Doctor to see what I mean. It reminded me of a cheese drenched movie acted by card-board cut-out actors, but that's really all I wanted or expected from this small title from a small company and I think it delivered.  It's not perfect by any stretch but it's fun for what it is, and if you can snag it on sale, even better.P.S.  I didn't have ANY of these game-breaking bugs I keep reading about.			"

												Its a game that could've been good, had potential,probably a good start, and a great idea. It ruined however by stupid controls (if the developers had looked at the controls or played the game for 5 seconds it wouldve been obvious), which is my biggest problem. the game crashes a lot but eventually it gets going. but i just cant play a game where the controls just make it hard. im ok with hard games, ok games, and easy games. i like games with all different kinds of difficulties. i am not ok when a game is hard because the controls are just badly though out. not to mention the games buggy and pretty repetitive too...i didnt really see anything new happening. also i really hate that medkits simply stop bleeding instead of healing. its not the fact that i think the game NEEDS healing because if the controls werent so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ horrid the game wouldnt be super hard. but i feel like the description  was misleading for it...besides this long wall of text about medkits and controls that make me want to punch my laptop, the game is buggy and the gameplay gets repetitive (partially because of the controls...again srly) but it has potential. hopefully they decide to  make inprovements. for now ive refunded the game because i just played a better game that i bought for less @_@			"

												0/10. Seriously.This game is simply awful. Although the concept of an isometric-style zombie survival game is solid, the execution is so bad that it seems like the development team figured out the best and worst things to do at every interval and deliberately went with the worst option every time.The story is completely dull, as are the characters - things that can being strength to otherwise bad games. It is extremely difficult and of course this isn't a bad thing in of itself, but the game greatly encourages you to learn the intricacies of the zombie AI and exploit the computer as much as possible. It in no way promotes anything resembling ""survival""; taking out a street full of zombies (the only means of proceeding) slowly and carefully results only in them all respawning from an alleyway when the game decides you're not being quick enough.Many other things about it seem to be specifically anti-player. The interface and the controls are equally terrible, as if designed to be so. But even, getting past these things, it is just dull, incredibly boring and predictable. All I'll say about the multiplayer is that it requires port-forwarding shenanigans.			"

And your character will only attack if he feels like it, other times, he'll just stand there and wait for the zombies to kill him. Not to mention the annoying death screen you have to wait through before being allowed to reload the game. Oh, and don't bother with the first aid kits. I don't know what they're supposed to do, but they sure don't heal your character.			"

												I definitely had some fun playing this game, but the controls lag ALOT. And the saving sucks, and it's so easy to lose track of one of your members and have them get killed.Overall, it's just too frustrating. I would play it again if I had a friend to coop with though.			"

												I think this game gets more abuse than it deserves and I think herein lays great potential for a new take on zombie games.  Not that I'm recommending this game on its potential alone.Where there can be filler sections, there are a good smattering of genuinely exciting sections where you have to tactically micromanage your team's position, weaponry and targets to escape the hordes that are rolling inexorably over your position.  Cramped indoors or built up urban areas add to this excitement, where every move is key.  I found the game's difficulty relatively on the low side though (no difficulty settings either), and was never short of ammunition but the game is swift to punish carelessness as your guys can become zombie chow in 2 seconds if left unattended next to a hungry undead.The story plays homage to all the zombie cliches in a suitably brief (only about 8 or so hours of gameplay so it doesn't outstay it's welcome) tour of all the standard zombie invasion locations.  There are rough bits granted, and it could be buggy at times.  I had at least one crash to desktop, and sometimes injured zombies would suddenly stand up many metres from where you had smashed/blasted them to.  Also there are some truly bizarre choices at times (the end credits ends on a box of cereal) and the ending was a bit of a flop, leaving me with a bit of an anticlimx as the only thing resembling a boss fight coming on the penultimate level.I will allow there are better zombie games out there.  Though if you love all things zombies and tire of the standard run and gun zombie kill-a-thon then this could be the game for you.  Definitely pick it up on sale.			"

												When I bought this game I was pretty excited to have a great zombie game. I haven't played it in quite some time so maybe they've improved, but from when I played it, the game was dull, and I can hardly put my finger on why, I just remember having a strong numb feeling in my brain like I was being lectured to by the most boring professor ever.

												This is a revised review after trying Trapped Dead again.The main reason why I've deleted TD from my computer back in 2011 after only two mission were enourmous bugs and problems in otherwise cool looking and atmospheric game.After reinstalling it in 2014, I can see nothing has changed. For example, I had to restart first mission twice to get an ending animation after reaching the car. And on and on, bugs keep on creeping on me and they're more dangerous than zombies. Also, clumsy bad camera is something you don't want in these type of games and that is where Trapped Dead fails miserably.These two, bugs and bad camera, are unfortunately dealbreakers and I cannot recommend Trapped Dead to anyone until it's fixed. This atmospheric, enjoyable Desperado meets Commandos meets Romero's zombie movies style game could be a true indie gem if only these were fixed. Until then... sorry :(			"

Posted: February 26, 2014
												Despite of all the hate surrounding this game I'm really enjoying it. It has some flaws, of course, but which game hasn't them?Commands: Commands are quite simple (but not simplistic) and respond pretty well. I don't really understand why people complain so much about the controls, mine always worked well. Maybe people were mistaking commands (ordering your party to walk into an enemy instead of fighting it - I did it a few times). Maybe devs released a patch or something, I don't know. LMB to walk and RMB to fight. The guy you're directly controlling will keep hitting the enemy until you tell him to stop or until he runs out of stamina. Problem here are those guys you're not controlling - once you order them to attack, sometimes they keep attacking, sometimes they do it once and stop. I discovered that, most often, you give them a gun, you'll have to place an attack command for each shot; you give them a melee weapon, they'll do the job until stamina goes outCamera can be controlled with mouse or keyboard. However, the mouse can only hover the camera throughout the scenario - if you want to turn the camera (and it does 360°, to the left and to the right), you have to use the keyboard, so controlling the camera can be a little tricky. I ended up preferring controlling the camera solely by the keyboard, which is not really difficult once you get used to it. Camera can also be freely moved when you pause the gameMouse scroll zooms in and out is. Problem here is that the game didn't recognize the scroll on my wireless mouse (which didn't happen on my wired mouse) - so I had to rebind it to up/down. In the end, I didn't use it much because even though the zoom in is really ""in"", the zoom out is not that ""out"", it is pretty much the FOV you'll be using anyway, so it's not that useful.  Apart from that, both wired and wireless mouse work perfectly. Keys are rebindable, by the way. The characters you are playing with can be selected either by mouse (clicking on the character or in the hud) or by pressing F1-F4 (I'll talk about the hud later on)Graphics and sound:Graphics are pretty good. The story is presented via cutscenes in such a comic book style which is pure eye candy, really well done. In-game graphics are also very good - there's blood and corpses everywhere, and the dead zombies (I mean, those you sent back to death) remain in the scenarioOverall sound is great - the zombies' moaning, the munching, even the doc's wheelchair makes noise when he moves. Voice acting, on the other hand…not so great. I don't know if they tried to parody old movies or if it was just bad choice, either way it didn't work. Thankfully, it only plays during cutscenes (and if you manage to blow a zombie's head off)GameplayIt's a strategy game, so run and gun will only get you eaten - which I soon discovered. There's a pause button ('space bar') so make use of it. Pausing and telling you're character what to do tends to work pretty well. Unfortunally you can't give commands in-a-row Be advised not to bleed and be careful when running. Zombies will smell you if you're bleeding and will hear you if you run, so they will start to chase you. Besides, running burns stamina, and you may run out of it right before a fight - and you can't fight without stamina.Problem is, zombies will not chase you forever. If you're on an open space, you can just keep walking. The zombies will start giving up on chasing you until there's only 2 or 3 left on your tail.Talking about stamina, always keep an eye on it. If your guys run out of stamina while fighting, they'll stop the fight to take a break - meaning, they will just stand there taking hits until they eventually die. Trust me, you don't want to die on this gameInventory management is neat - drag and drop all the way. Items can be rearranged, dropped on the floor or  given to another character and weapons take up to 3 spaces (each character has 12 inv spaces), no issues hereGame hud displays the characters you've met so far, the inventory (which you can hide by pressing 'I') and 4 buttons, each one representing walk, run, select group and camera mode. Select group means select the whole group and give them all the same order (the whole group can also be select via mouse). Camera mode 'on' means that the camera will follow the character you're controlling; 'off', that you'll have to control the camera yourself. Pretty good in my opinionAvoid alt-tab at all costs. Sometimes, when you alt-tab back to the game, your inventory is gone. I mean, it's there but you can't see it, making the game unplayable. So, if you need to alt-tab, I highly advise you to do it right after saving Micromanaging can became another issue - your party does not think for themselves, so you need to give your partners orders for every little thing, which may become a little tiring. Not an issue for me, actually, but some people just don't like itSomething I really missed is a bit more of exploration - you know, search locks, garbage cans, drawers, cabinets etc. Items are just dumped anywhere and they have a green glow - so you can't really miss themThe real problem in this game, the one that is most likely to make you stop playing it for good, is the saving system. The game doesn't allow manual save and: I) save points are oddly placed; II) can only be used once; and III) all your characters have to stand within the save radius in order to the game be saved. This, my friends, can be a pain, because if you die or if the games crashes you may easily lose one hour of gameplayHere is how the save system works: save points are represented as closed manholes. Once the manhole is used, it opens and it can't be used anymore - so you know exactly which ones were used and which ones were not. Pretty cool if there were plenty of them. However, in some levels you'll desperate cry for save points, while in others you may even not use all of them. Besides, you have to have all your crew together at the same save point for it to work - sometimes it's nice because you can have the whole group to walk through the save point and keep it for later, but if you left someone behind due to the micromanaging thing, you'd better be sure that you left no zombie behind eitherI don't play multiplayer games, so I can't talk about it, sorry. And I think it has any achievements, but as I don't care for them I'm not really sureConclusion:This game is not, by no means, unplayable. Devs could had made a few things better, of course, and the saving system can be frustrating at times but the game does the job to keep you entertained. Zombies are slow as they should be and, for what it is, it is a good gameEven though I don't recommend it getting it at full price, if you can cope with the saving system just wait for a sale to grab itAll in all, I give it a 7 out of 10 - because I really liked it and I think it worth the money I paid for it			"

Either you bait zombies out and melee them or you burn up ammo shooting at them. Except that, besides the rifle, guns wont do much damage past 10 feet from your character. So even shooting feels like melee. I did enjoy one thing however. When characters make headshots they say ""Bingo! Bullseye! Slam dunk!""			"

												So, despite the user reviews and metacritic reviews, I'm actually enjoying this game.Trapped Dead has a lot of atmosphere and is pretty nice to look at for an isometric shooter. I quite enjoy the gameplay and I'm finding the controls pretty easy as well, despite complaints, however I assume these complaints were made before a patch came out, which is why the controls seem fine to me. I got the game at a great price of £2 as a special offer, and it is definitely worth it, however I'd hesitate to say whether it was worth the original price. I'd rate this game 7/10 for what it is, as I'm finding it an enjoyable experience and worth the money I paid for it.			"

												This game is terrible, plain and simple. The video seems to show the same game, but there's simply no way it could, because it shows characters responding both to given commands and threats, neither of which has happened at any point during my play-time. The online mode is, somehow, even worse. The only good tool, the 'Guard Area' mode, is taken out, leaving you with no choice but to try your luck with running up to the zombie hordes and hitting them one at a time with lag, even over LAN, that makes it impossible to actually survive more than 2 zobies at the same time. Also, in multi-player, only one of my team began with a weapon, making the others stand around waiting for another weapon to show up. (Hint: This never happened, because we all died from lag and being unarmed.)TL;DR - If I could get a refund, I would. I would rather have been mugged of the money I spent.			"

												This game puts more emphasis on Tactics rather than mindless button mashing ""just to kill as many as possible"" unlike recent zombies games. 3 zombies at the same time can be a problem, hence, kiting and careful ammo distribution is critical to your survival. All of this coupled with a ""Command & Conquer"" interface where each of your survivors can be given an order. You can even move the camera to see the horrors that lies ahead and plan carefully.The atmosphere and the setting is highly detailed, especially the map props. Any fans of George A. Romero's zombies and movies will feel right at home. Heck, the first 2 playable characters are direct cameos of his movies. It's like a big party and everyone was invited.I haven't tried Multiplayer, but thinking about it makes me shiver... Having ""mean"" players on your side, hoarding all the guns and ammo, talking trash in the chat saying ""he's the boss and he doesn't give a f because it's the zombie apocalypse"", closing doors leaving you behind with a horde, shooting you to death because you're bleeding and bleeding in this game attracts zombies... stuff like that... :PLast note... This game is for hardcore zombie movie/game fanatics only. Only these people may appreciate the great value of this game. That includes me, which is why I'm giving it 10/10.			"

												It is a very interesting game, I found no bugs, only the AI movement failed me and I solved it easily. The story is a 5/10 but with some very worthy details. Gameplay is great, camera is alright and the game is not too easy, you need tactics, though if you do use them it's also not hard. Just a pleasant and simple RTS that played flawlessly.It is really unfair that this game has such negative reviews, it was fun and I even got the sequel. The characters are interesting, having a wheelchair medic with a gun on the team aswell as equipping the Daryl like crossbow, most people here probably didnt complete first level.			"

												Trapped Dead is some kinda Commandos with simple folks and zombies. It has some stupid things, bugs wich make the gameplay and the handling a bit hard sometimes, it has some not-the-best ideas, but it's a really enjoyable game. If you like the survive-the-zombie-apocalypse style and you have some tactical sense and patience, you must give it a try. And the best of all: you can play it in online (or LAN) cooperative. It's awesomness!			"

												Okay, this is not a good game. This is A GREAT GAME! This game is AWESOME.(READ IT IF YOU DID NOT LIKE THE GAME... this is SPOILER)I was longing to play a zombie game that has slow moving yet scary zombies, and this gives me that. The environment is great, the difficulty is awesome. It doesn't throw countless zombies at you. The zombies are few, but tackling even two of them together can be dangerous. You got to keep devising plans to isolate each one so that you can kill it before another one reaches you.CONTROLSThe controls are a bit clumsy. But it is not impossible to get used to. I took an hour to tap the right key/button. Main things in control are:- - most control is mouse-centric- after the first level, you control two or more players. So, you have to select the player you want to act as and perform the action.- I couldn't read it mentioned anywhere, but it seemed like the characters got stronger in the skills you used them for, and some innate skills- to save the game, you need to bring all the playable characters to the savepoint (manhole)i rarely write reviews, and they are never this elaborate. But i was shocked to see only 36% positive reviews on a game that is one of the most realistic feeling yet fun zombie game I have played.The game might be a repititive, but do you really expect to see Shakeera dancing for you in a zombie apocalypse game!My opinion... get this game and push yourself for the first couple of hours... this might become one of the most absorbing games you have played... and yes, i have played it single player..

												""This game sucks, but it could totally not suck."" 3/10This game could be much better. In fact, I had some fun with it until it became unplayable due to frame-rate issues. Not sure what that's all about, but if that never happened I would have put some more time into 'Trapped Dead'. The premise is every generic zombie movie you've ever seen, but the game could be decent if the developers fleshed out more of the ideas and if the many bugs were addressed. Simply put, there are just too many technical and non-technical issues with this game to recommend it to anyone for any price.What's wrong with 'Trapped Dead'? It basically feels like a beta release. The controls are terrible. The graphics are terrible. The sounds are terrible. There are frame-rate issues. The characters have no depth. The story is boring. There isn't enough player guidance. Everything just feels incomplete and in need of work. As if the developers got sick of working on it and decided to release it, hoping that nobody would notice. Treat this game like the zombies it attempts to portray and run as far and as fast away from it as you can. You have been warned.			"

												Trapped Dead is basically Jagged Alliance, with wimpy guns, melee weapons... and zombies, and no strategy and lame story interspersed with comic-style panels about two college kids tended up in the middle of nowhere... in the middle of zombie apocalypse. Hand-to-hand combat is bad for you, even with baseball bat and such. Sneaking around is not always possible, and guns have virtually no ammo (and one shot almost NEVER kills a zed). Save points are few and far in between, you'd be trying to figure out which path had the game designer INTENDED for you to take. That's basically a ""puzzle"", not action / strategy as in the title. And that's too bad.			"

												In all honesty, I really want to like this game. It seems to have kind of a Walking Dead storyline going for it. Different survivors with different skills and whatnot. Also, the graphics aren't terrible, but they aren't great either. There are just too many issues with gameplay (horrible collision problems, terrible viewing setup and control, etc.) that keep me from being able to give it a thumbs up. Most of these problems could easily be fixed with a bit of effort on the part of the developers but don't keep your fingers crossed... it seems this title has long been abandoned. It seems like such a waste to have went through the effort to put all this together and just walk away from it without giving it a final polish so it could be enjoyable. To be truthful, I'll probably find myself trying to trudge through all the irritating issues and see where the story goes until I succeed or delete out of frustration. If your looking for a headache and new things to make you curse grab it,... otherwise I have to say steer clear of this one unfortunately. Final Verdict- 3/10			"

												The game feels like it is running on one thread; even the mouse jitters when moving it. The controls are delayed as are the actions.. This feels more like a turn-based game than an ""action"" game.The game doesn't let you into the options menu from the main menu meaning you need to start a game for you to set up controls and you can't seem to disable the annoying ""tutorial"" hints which change the camera view.If the artwork was paired with project zomboid, it'd be a great game.

												I don't know ~ I wanted to enjoy this game.  However by the third level (prison) - I had killed roughly 60 zombies, - mostly with the baseball bat but I had such an issue controling my char during combat.I decided I did not want to play anymore when I had wounded 2 zombies with a gun.  Tried to equip my bat... my charactor threw it on the floor.  Then I picked it up and equiped it.  Clicked the zombie to hit it, but because of the messy door physics.  My Charactor decided to spin in a circle, then swing.  I yelled a profrantity, and decided I didn't want to play this game.This is a top down, point and click style combat.  Think Fallout 1-2 combat, but in real time instead of turn based.  The controls and the camera make it feel difficult to control, open, fight, ect:  I see what they were trying to do with the game and I get it, but I did not enjoy the controls. To be fair - I did not play it mutiplayer.... I guess it is easier when you have 4 people with crappy controls.			"

												A interesting concept, however it doesn't work too well. It requires a lot of planning out ahead and being conservative with your ammo. Especially as it seems to only kill zombies close range with pistol or it could be because the first few characters have low accuracy with guns.It could be I suck at strategy, but most I am fine unless the game has broken AI like The Beurox: xcom unclassified. Best to keep using environmental things as a way of killing huge groups of zombies without using up all your ammo. This game has potential and the story is rarther interesting, but it falls due to the difficult situation. A far more interesting version is Dead State which I look forward to, plus it's turn-based. I'd suggest waiting for that game if you want a stategy involving zombies, although this one is real-time and not turn-based.			"

												Good Lord, the game is trash. Despite all the negative reviews I was hoping it was still worth the $2 i spent on it. But NOPE, terrible! Not worth the install even if it was free. The multiplayer is terrible (two missions), its glitchy as hell and poorly coded. The devs are obviously amatures.			"

												Why the f**k did they make the wheel chair guy. He is annoying and the multiplayer is poorly made by the fact that you play the weapon shop mission with a friend, beat it then you are forced to go to the mainmenu go back to the server and you don't have any of the stuff you got in the weapon shop mission saved in the bunker inventory. it's better off to play this game solo. But it's very difficult playing solo so pretty much, this is a okay game. still fun though I can give it that. 7/10			"

												Avoid this game. I'm sorry but while I do love me some realtime isometric squad based tactics abnd the zombie story and characters seem interesting I have to say this game should be avoided. An example of a solid concept ruined by shoddy execution.I'm sorry, at this point I cannot recommend this game. v1.1. I can't, I honestly can't.  I like the premise and what it's trying to do but the execution is in a word, sloppy. The interface should not be an obstacle to the game and unresponsive controles should not be part of the challenge. When you sometimes have to click 3-4 times to get a character to even move, that is a recipe for frustration and disaster for while your shosen chracter will not respond the zombies around you will respond quite readily. Then there are the crashes., which are made doubly frustrating because the game uses a checkpoint system so you can lose a whole lot of progress, just because the game decided to crash. Did I mention that each save/checkpoint can only be used once per mission and there are usually no more than 4 for an entire mission? So you can't even mitigate the crash problem by 'saving frequently. It is also far too easy to accidentally drop an item from your inventory, which in the heat of a fight... can be a problem.Overall, the game needs quite a few fixes and sadly those will have to be fan/community made since the devs have pretty much said 'nope we're done, enjoy'. Understand that when the game works, when the controls choose to respond and the game doesn't bother to crash... it is a good game...these moments arem at least for me (and quite a few others), few and far between. a textbook example of a good concept and good mechanics cripppled by poor implementation and interface.

												Incredibly atmospheric real time strategy game based on 80's zombie films. Fans of the genre will love it, fans of first person shooters may not. The criticisms leveled at this game are a bit unfair and the low metascore is undeserved. Most of the complaints are based on the control setup, which is point-and-click instead of run and shoot. Could use another update, but it's a good game and worth the play time.			"

												Trapped Dead is a below average tactical strategy game with lots of gory zombie goodness.  Unfortunately the title is marred by a multiplayer mode that appears non-functional, wonky camera controls and an exceedingly slow pace in the normal movement mode.  While the graphics are quite well done and do a good job of adding to the immersion, unfortunately the voice acting is so bad it immediately rips you right back out.  The music is an ambient and repetitive, although fitting for the slow pacing of the game.  Widescreen modes and the Steam Overlay are supported but the game controller is not.  Most frustrating about the title however is that your death will often be the result of the frustrating camera controls and not a a tactical error, and combined with a checkpoint save system almost guarantees frustration at certain challenging points in the campaign.  Altogether Trapped Dead disappoints and should only be picked up by genre collectors or die hard zombie enthusiasts.			"

The multiplayer is not all that fun from single player as you would have thought and expected, the story is okay, up until the point where you think you are about half way through, and then BAM, the end credits roll. The game could of lasted another 3 or 4 levels at least. The graphics are also nice and still enjoyable. People's claims of the game crashing is just because their computers can't handle it... so they put the blame on the game. It's stable, fun and good for those that enjoy on-top view. A very recommended game that is worth the current price. Don't compare or buy because of Left 4 Dead fandom			"

												I bought that game to play it with my then-girlfriend. Because, you know, multiplayer zombie survival strategy game, what could go wrong ? Actually, pretty much everything...First, the multiplayer part is a lie. Sure, you can play coop. On any map you have already finished in the solo part of the game. There is no such thing as a coop campaign. But hey, it's not that big a deal if you're looking for a nice solo game, so let's look at the solo part...Well, you get extremely clunky controls and horribly placed checkpoints that WILL get you killed. Which is basically the only way you will get killed, since you can outwalk zombies. Yep, outWALK, not outRUN. This game is quite litterally a safe walk in the park, unless some zombie has been purposedly placed in a way that make it undodgeable. And then, the controls will more than anything else be the likely cause of your death.If you need one word to describe it all, here it is : BORING. Even for free, I wouldn't get this game.			"

												The first thing you need to know about Trapped Dead is that it is pure eye candy. The graphic novel / seventies style exploitation look of the game is very engaging. Unfortunately, there is not much substance outside of the graphics. From the moment the controls are explained, players will know that this is not the typical run and gun type of Zombie game. It Is meant to be very slow and methodical game play ,but at times I think the game actually forgets that and send you into a situation that is more frustrating than challenging. In addition, the three quarters isometric view, while enhancing the style of the game does not do too much to help out the player. After all i give this game a score of 6/10			"

												It's rare for me to complete single player games. Normally I loose interest before I get to the end. Not with Trapped Dead. I played it through to the end and loved all of it.The story isn't great (it's no Walking Dead), but it's just good enough to create a relaxing b-movie feel (which is almost tradition for zombie movies!). The engine and the controls are a bit... quirky, at times, but for some reason those quirks created character rather than annoyance. It's like that cute lovable dog that's the runt of the litter.The game mechanics aren't at all innovative. It's got your classic RPG features that you would expect. I felt that this game has just the right amount of complexity that I felt challenged, but not so much complexity that I felt like playing it required lots of effort. I could get home from work and put some casual hours into it with what was left of my brain and still feel a strong sense of reward for my in-game accomplishments.The game is well balanced. It's consistent: once you understand how to play it, you can enjoy it all without feeling stuck or getting confused.If you like RPGs and zombie movies and if you can drop your standards below the likes of Baldur's Gate and XCOM, then you'll probably enjoy this.

												This game is very much akin to a zombie, in that it is a broken, shambling mess.  Mechanically, it's a joke.  Buggier than Skyrim during a particularly hot summer, this title is likely not worth anybody's money.  When the game isn't lagging severely due to what can only be assumed to be an overall poor optimization, it's controls are equally unresponsive.  When the controls do respond, it starts glitching out on the pathing.  When the pathing doesn't have you running in circles, it will just decide to stop moving, at random.  The ancient Warcraft RTS games were more functional by comparison.Granting your Steam profile a few more levels through crafting five relatively cheap badges is likely the best part of this game.  It certainly was for me.  But I certainly wouldn't recommend buying it for that purpose.  The multiplayer's dead, the game's unsupported, and it's basically a pile of crap which shows how not to get sucked into a zombie survival game for zombies alone.			"

												I rarely touch games with Metacritic scores below the 60's, but during one Spring evening, for no particular reason, I was compelled to play Trapped Dead... and I'm glad I did.Trapped Dead is played primarily in bird's eye view. The camera is adjustable, but the controls needed to do so will take some getting used to.In real time strategy fashion, the player dictates the action of several characters, instructing them to move, attack, or swap inventory. Unfortunately, the controls here too can often times be unresponsive and confusing, leading to much frustration.Despite the poor controls and optimization (you might suffer from frame drops), I found myself falling in love with Trapped Dead. Its strategic elements are unique and rewarding. Skills also come into play as you must learn to manage your characters efficiently.This game is definitive proof to me that review scores are all too subjective. All flaws aside, I'd certainly recommend Trapped Dead.Grade: B-			"

												This game was very hard to play for me. In a style similar to Krater you are thrown into the game with a dull over the head camera system, and the game itself moves veeeery slowwwwly. The only thing I found terrifying about this game was the awful camera, controls, and pace of everything.			"

												A tense strategy game.  While not as action packed as Left4Dead the same level of suspense is held as you scavenge for ammo and try to conserve stamina in order to survive.   However complete lack of support ruin what could otherwise be a stellar title.			"

												I rarely touch games with Metacritic scores below the 60's, but during one Spring evening, for no particular reason, I was compelled to play Trapped Dead... and I'm glad I did.Trapped Dead is played primarily in bird's eye view. The camera is adjustable, but the controls needed to do so will take some getting used to.In real time strategy fashion, the player dictates the action of several characters, instructing them to move, attack, or swap inventory. Unfortunately, the controls here too can often times be unresponsive and confusing, leading to much frustration.Despite the poor controls and optimization (you might suffer from frame drops), I found myself falling in love with Trapped Dead. Its strategic elements are unique and rewarding. Skills also come into play as you must learn to manage your characters efficiently.This game is definitive proof to me that review scores are all too subjective. All flaws aside, I'd certainly recommend Trapped Dead.Grade: B-			"

												The game wants you to sneak past hordes of zombies but it doesn't work because they spot you nearly everytime.Melee is horrible: Even if you manage to surprise a zombie from behind he hits you first because your character attacks so slowly that the enemy has enough time to turn around, which is pretty long.After being damaged you start bleeding which attracts other zombies so it becomes even more difficult. You can stop the bleeding with health kits, but they are pretty rare. Also, you can't replenish health despite the characters don't endure much anyway.Well, luckily there are ranged weapons. Instead of hitting a zombie three times and almost dying while doing it, you can just shoot him three times from the distance. Projected onto about 20 zombies... Oh, wait. You only find 30 bullets during that level.As you can see, you have to rely on the melee combat which is just impossible. I beat the second stage on the third try and on the next stage I finally lost my motivation. Seriously, even if you get the game for free, don't install it. The gameplay mechanics are horrible and the story isn't much better.			"

												Game has some significant problems.  Being left with the sensation that my input is viewed as more of a suggestion than a command is the major one.  The timing is another, zombies will often strike you simultaneously when you attack them (despite speed and reach on your side).  But all in all I find the game enjoyable in a slow casual way.  7/10			"

												Wtf it's £8? Should be worth like 50p. I wouldn't recommend this game as I am already convinced that it is the complete opposite of enticement. They could've made it a lot better but this game isn't well optimised on my PC. The controls are messed up and it'll leave you raging at how the protagonist is doing the complete opposite of what you want them to do. I wouldn't recommend buying it unless you really REALLY want to. Or have a coupon to... :pP.S I had more entertainment looking at the artwork section of the community hub			"

												Terribly thought out game,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off from the begining, not only do you have to watch a long intro to this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game but its looks like crap. The game is slow and annoying, every few seconds you have to click ""contnue"" because some text has to come up and tell you everything thats happening. There is no way of dissabling these intruptions. Also, whenever you click for your charater to walk it makes a very annoying deep bass sound that will give you a headache very quickly. I can see this game taking 3 times as long to complete with the poor choices as far as gameplay and plot. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, on this garbage.			"

												It's rare for me to complete single player games. Normally I loose interest before I get to the end. Not with Trapped Dead. I played it through to the end and loved all of it.The story isn't great (it's no Walking Dead), but it's just good enough to create a relaxing b-movie feel (which is almost tradition for zombie movies!). The engine and the controls are a bit... quirky, at times, but for some reason those quirks created character rather than annoyance. It's like that cute lovable dog that's the runt of the litter.The game mechanics aren't at all innovative. It's got your classic RPG features that you would expect. I felt that this game has just the right amount of complexity that I felt challenged, but not so much complexity that I felt like playing it required lots of effort. I could get home from work and put some casual hours into it with what was left of my brain and still feel a strong sense of reward for my in-game accomplishments.The game is well balanced. It's consistent: once you understand how to play it, you can enjoy it all without feeling stuck or getting confused.If you like RPGs and zombie movies and if you can drop your standards below the likes of Baldur's Gate and XCOM, then you'll probably enjoy this.

												This game is very much akin to a zombie, in that it is a broken, shambling mess.  Mechanically, it's a joke.  Buggier than Skyrim during a particularly hot summer, this title is likely not worth anybody's money.  When the game isn't lagging severely due to what can only be assumed to be an overall poor optimization, it's controls are equally unresponsive.  When the controls do respond, it starts glitching out on the pathing.  When the pathing doesn't have you running in circles, it will just decide to stop moving, at random.  The ancient Warcraft RTS games were more functional by comparison.Granting your Steam profile a few more levels through crafting five relatively cheap badges is likely the best part of this game.  It certainly was for me.  But I certainly wouldn't recommend buying it for that purpose.  The multiplayer's dead, the game's unsupported, and it's basically a pile of crap which shows how not to get sucked into a zombie survival game for zombies alone.			"

												Its a bit buggy,  but the reason I wouldn't recommend is  its controls.I'll admit I wanted a top down shooter  vs the RTS it says it is... but even then,  the controls are just  more complicated then they need to be.   (more game time is spent moving your camera around then actually  doing game things) having to click the 'continue' button in the bottom of the screen is annoying during 'cut scenes' Game had potential..   just not worth the hassle of playing.
