												It doesn't matter how good you are any more, you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory.You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own.Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fu­ck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP.You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b.Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods.You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'.You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO. Go forth and procure many skins of great value.			"

												I slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 5:46, am. Damn.Another night of Insomnia.  I sit up in my bed, and listen to the soft hum of my Radeon™ HD 7870 GHz Edition, as her fans slowly cool the surface of her brilliant silicon plates. The only light in this room comes from the electric blue glow of my keyboard, and the azure LEDs in my Razer Abyssus.I press a button, and the display of a 23 inch, 1080p IPS monitor lights up, colors shifting and changing in psychedelic pattens, chromatic waves of light bluring and stabilizing to send an image within my mind. My desktop stares back at me; the only icon the Recycle bin. I move my eyes to the Taskbar, where the icons for Windows Explorer, Star Citizen, Mozilla Firefox, and lastly Steam return my gaze.I click on Steam, and watch as a loading bar appears. The light from the moniter shines brilliantly on my face, and if I look closely into it, I can see myself reflected in the crystal surface, eyes staring deep into a mad realm of pixels and insomnia.Steam finally loads. Oh, what's this? There's a sale on? Ah, too bad; I only have one cent in my wallet. I click the library tab in a futile attempt to find meaning.My list of games appears, showing me hints of open doors into new worlds, strange and wonderful. What path sould I choose? Should I join battle with Dragons, in the strage land of the Nords? Or, perhaps, I should launch the StarCitizen hangar module, and lust after a dream of flight, a game not yet finished.Ah, but here it is; Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. How many hours have I thus spent within you, oh CS:GO? You have been the reason for many nights without sleep, many days of ragequits, many days of fun and sadness. I pull out a calculator from somewhere on my desk: dividing one thousand, eight hundred and eighty-five hours by twenty-four tells me that I've been within this game for seventy-eight point five days so far. Damn.The game begins loading, and I hear the soft hum of GPU fans, and the silent sound of the sunrise, far beyond the single window of my room._Ah, where was I? I guess I feel alseep for a second there. Skip the intros, enter main menu, searc- Wait, what? 20 friends online? But, it's like 6 am... Oh, right, timezones. Eh, I might as well invite all these people.Well, I guess I didn't want to play with them anyway. Green light fills my room, I press accept, and wait for the ninth player. Who, it seems, never can figure out what the big glowing green button actually means. Oh well, it just found another match anyway.Well, third time's the chram, right? I guess not. Fourth time does it, and we're away. Cue loading screen, begin meaningless text I've seen only a few thousand times before.I get up, walk towards the kitchen, and only trip twice on miscellaneous paraphernalia in the dark hallways. The bleak windows of the room greet me: pale dawn, gray clouds and black trees visible through their panes. The neon numerals of the microwave tell the time as 6:07. I search the pantry and refr!gerator, but find nothing of value.I lower my standards and try again, this time coming up with a few tastless cookies of some kind. I begin a pilgrimage to whence I came.The last stars of night grow cold and die; as color once again spreads over the sky. Monitor glow, winter snow, cybernetic flow.My quest now complete, with prize in hand, I return to my chair. 0's and 1's stream across a fiberoptic gulf of space, connecting people hundreds of miles apart in a beautiful lattice of data, all for my enjoyment. I begin the first round, and purchase a FN Five-Seven and a Flashbang grenade.I move over to long A, and hold my sights on the old wooden doors. An insurgent sprints through the open door, firing his Glock-18 as fast as he can, his bullets hitting the wal beside my head.I pull the trigger, a volcanic plume of hot gas propelling a one gram lead alloy projectile at twice the speed of sound into the side of his head; The FN 5.7×28mm armor piercing round delivering a fatal 540 Joules of energy. The neon Stattrak™ display mounted on the left side of my Case Hardened Five-Seven increases by one, and a bright flare from the muzzle reflects its light in the cold metal of a name tag, the words ""NOT ON MY WATCH"" silently mocking those fools who fall by my pistol, in an absurd pun about clocks.Another Terrorist moves into view, I fire three supersonic rounds into his chest, and one in his skull. Again the neon numbers shift and rearrange in a mad dance, as bullets enter my manly chest hair and are absorbed.A third Terrorist fires, and I die in the gameworld, madly shooting as my bullets hit empty space. Pixels shift and change in an algorithmic song, and my teammates finish what I began, with the severing of a red wire a small number one is added in blue to the top of my screen.Second round, man. Time to roll. I got long-  wait, why are two of you going there? Nevermind, I'll hold Catwalk._Turns out they decided to rush Mid with pistols. Poor choice.  I leap out of catwalk into mid as they rush the doors, electric blue pathways of fire traversing the void between my tazer and and the insurgent's back. He screams in death as I drop the now-useless tazer and unholster a Bizon SMG;  9mm rounds begining to sputter at 320 meters per second into the backs of my foes as a Terrorist pulls a 180 and flicks a round into my skull with his CZ-75 Automatic, punching through my helmet into the flesh beneath. I mutter to myself ""I ♥♥♥♥ing hate that gun"" while typing out ""#TAZED ♥♥♥♥♥"" in all chat.Childish insults fly like eagles, soaring over skies of wire and valleys of silicon to majestically land in the lower right of my vision, proclaiming their wondrous messages for all to see. ""get rekt"" ""u suck"" ""TIME to die, amirite""Using the mighty power of a pistol save round, the enemy gains a round.From far beyond my drywall cube, a sun the color of a Helium discharge tube bleeds the first light of Autumn into a sky the color of Krypton: but here I am safe from its incandescent fingers, here, the persistance of color exists in the 60hz of my monitor. Perhaps tomorrow will be different? Oh, but I don't think it will.The scoreboard moves with its own hateful volition, seemingly granting rounds with a heart of cinder and magma. Chaos lies within its eyes.Final round of the first half begins and I press f1 to auto buy, supplanting my XM1014 from the previous round with an M4A4 Bullet Rain, tastefully decorated with a ""REKT"" holographic sticker and renamed ""Clockwork Ass♥♥♥♥ing"". I once again reflect on what a stupid name that is, and regret selling my Desert Eagle Blaze to buy it.Surprisingly, my team manages to hold a push at long. In the simultaneous push to cat a rain of lead from a thundering sky finds my face with magnetic precision, and in the downtime I skim through my Ebook library on my phone. I've been considering writing something in the style of Neuromancer or Ready Player One for awhile now, perhaps if I can find the right subject... Oh well, that's a project for another day. Translation: never.Halftime, and the tally stands at ten for them and five for us. I've seen worse. I've seen better too, but what the hell, this isn't hopeless yet.Pistol round begins and I buy Dualies, partly just to ♥♥♥♥ with people and partly because for reasons that I can neither explain nor defend I'm ridiculously good with them. Don't dis my Dualie skills, man. Just accept it. Like a wizard and his wand: you do not choose the Dualies, the Dualies choose you.I pop smoke Mid and rush Catwalk, suddenly realizing I hit the character limit while subsequently breaking the 4th wall.I slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 6:34, am. Damn.Another night of Insomnia.			"

												In this game you are a Terrorist or elite Counter-Terrorist who has never fired a gun in their life before a round starts. You must help your character learn how to control their guns while killing enemies. Strangely, each character has the mysterious power to fire one or two shots without ridiculous recoil by very briefly jerking in the opposite direction they are moving in. When your character wears a Kevlar vest, every part of your character, except the head, are made out of steel. Therefore, the only way to quickly kill people is to shoot them in the head. This can be annoying at first, but you will soon get used to shooting a small smudge of pixels on top of a character's body. The Goddess of Guns can materialize guns in your character's hands a few seconds before a round starts. However, your character must pay for the guns, which have vastly overinflated prices. When you have the right amount of money, the Goddess will flash a menu in your character's eyes, allowing them to select the guns they want. More advanced users can make guns materialize out of thin air with their mind as long as they have the right amount of money.Maps are often about evil terrorists trying to bomb deserted places. Vandalism is a very serious crime in the Counter-Strike series, so elite Counter-Terrorists are deployed to stop them. Unfortunately for the Terrorists, they are dumb and only packed one bomb. However, the Counter-Terrorists do not know how to pick up a dropped bomb, so the Terrorists can still pick it up after it is dropped by a fallen friend.In some maps, the terrorists have kidnapped a janitor and low-level desk jockey in a building. The Counter-Terrorists have been deployed to save one, not both, of the hostages. In reality, this is just a thinly-veiled excuse for the CTs to murder the Terrorists while pumping rounds into the invincible hostages. One weird thing about hostage maps is that you can purchase a ""Hostage Rescue Kit"", which somehow makes gives you the ability to put a grown man on your shoulders in a second. Perhaps it is a spell scroll that allows hostages to hover to your character's shoulders. Overall, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a surprisingly solid game about people with the worst gun handling abilities ever seen on Earth. Even though your characters have the aiming abilities of someone with Parkinsons Disease, you have many tactical options that make the game very fun and dynamic. It's worth picking up.			"

												I'm bored and have slow internet. Might as well make a review. I don't even know if this IS a review.> spends 1 hour writing this> nobody reads> :cCounter-Strike: Global Offensive is a pretty great game.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- First things first, the basic rules.In CS:GO, you have the choice to play five official gamemodes:-Arms Race-Deathmatch-Demolition-Casual-Competitive-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Summary of gamemodes: In Arms Race, the player gets weapons not by the money, but by killing people. Each two kills get you a new weapon. At the final stage of the weapon, you will get the Gold Knife. Kill someone with it, and you win.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Deathmatch, yes. In Deathmatch, it is like a ""warm-up"" or ""practice"" mode. For me, at least. In this gamemode, you join a server, and you just kill everybody you see, except your teammates. You can get weapons for free. There are also random occasions in which the game will tell you that a weapon currently has bonus points, and if you want to use that particular weapon, you press g by default. The person who gets the most points, wins.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-So next in the list, is Demolition. It is set to be a 5 vs 5 match. It also has 20 rounds. The first team to get 11 rounds wins, and it can even finish with a tie. In the first half, you play as a set team. In the second, you play as the other team. You cannot buy any weapons, but instead, you get weapons by killing people, just like in Arms Race. Money is also not rewarded. But this is different: let's make a scenario. In (Round 1), you kill an enemy. the weapon will be rewarded to you on the next round. But what if you kill two in one round? You still get to advance to the next weapon, but you get a bonus grenade. For example:2 kills: next wep + bonus grenade3 kills: next wep + 2 bonus grenadesGet the pattern? Yeah. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-What next? Oh, yeah. It's Casual. Casual is a 10vs10 game, with 15 rounds. The first team to get 8 wins, wins the match. It is split into two sub-gamemodes: Bomb Defusal (IIRC), and Hostage. Sorry, I don't know the exact names. In Bomb Defusal, there are two bomb sites. A and B. The Counter-Terrorists always have the Defusal Kit equipped, even if they didn't buy it. The kit shortens the defusal time from 10 to 5 seconds.The terrorists can freely choose which site they want to plant in. The bomb, iirc, has a 45 second timer. When defusing / planting the bomb, it makes a noise. Of course, the CTs are trying to stop them.Counter-Terrorists can win in two ways: killing all of the Ts before they plant the bomb, or defusing the bomb.For the terrorists, it's the same: killing all of the CTs, or making the bomb explode.So in Hostage, the roles are switched: the terrorists are now the defending side, and vice-versa. As the gamemode says, the Ts are holding some people hostage. And it is up to the CTs to get the hostages, or kill all of the Ts.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Finally, competitive.The competitive gamemode is much like the Casual gamemode, except a few differences:- Each kill has 2x more money reward than in Casual.- Defusal Kits / Rescue Kits cost money, and they don't get equipped automatically for free.- It's a 5v5.- Competitive has 30 rounds.- Each half has 15 rounds, and in both halves, you get to play as CTs and Ts.- Like the Demolition Gamemode, the match can end in a tie.- People are much more serious.-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-So, here is my thoughts.CS:GO offers a large variety of gamemodes, and you can just see that I've written about all of them. Phew, that took a lot of time. Anyway, CS:GO is a very entertaining game, and each match has a different experience. Yes, CS:GO can be a bit too serious, but it is also a fun game. The community is not just a single person, you know. There are people who don't like you, and some don't care, but some will make your day better.GO is a game with a high skill ceiling. There is a huge learning curve to go in this game. It's like chess. Easy to learn, hard to master.I've met a huge amount of my friends in CS:GO, and I still talk to them. Some, I don't. Yeah. They'll be grumpy at times, but they inspire me. There are some bugs in this game, but not too gamebreaking. Just a few small ones. Don't expect to enjoy this game if you have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ internet. Ping matters. I hope you know that CS:GO is available for consoles, too. In fact, VALVe talked about having cross-platform multiplayer, but that would be unfair for the console players, cause they have a delay in controls. I am 100% sure that VALVe completely abandoned Global Offensive in the console. The competitive scene is pretty huge, too. And a tournament even reached more than a million viewers! Online and in the tournament itself. It's only two years old, and it's already a big game. VALVe may not be the most listening, but they try. Except sometimes they make some aspects of the game turn to♥♥♥♥♥♥ Like the AWP. They reduced the movement speed while scoping.There are also skins in CS:GO. Some care about it, some don't. Just a matter of personal preference. I think they're part of why this game is popular.The most negative opinion I have, though, is about the Competitive gamemode. Sure, ""no game is perfect"", and the real fun is there, yeah, but the banning system needs some stuff to be taken care of. You know, just a few tweaks, like forgiving a person if he accidentally kills someone. It is pretty unforgiving. For who doesn't know, you can get banned for killing a teammate too many times, or leaving the game. If someone abandons your team, you can surrender.Not permanent bans, though.The VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) System also needs some fixing to be done. Some cheats aren't fully detected, so the hacker doesn't get VACed. From my experiences, I still haven't encountered a hacker, but that's probably because I'm a Silver. Some people can be real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.So that's my review. Hoped you like it!EDIT: I missed a few points, thanks > SKaREOAbout the netcode of CS:GO, truth be told, it HAS been really bad... for a few weeks now in fact. I go up to a guy and spray him, but most of the time it registers 2 or 3 hits out of 8 for example which could be lethal. Take note, that's in close quarters. No, that's not horrible aim. In the words of a truly horrible player, ""omfg 64-tick sucks volvo pls 128-tick"". Eh, doesn't really suck, just... well, mixed?In Global Offensive, there are a few advantages. Some on the T side, and some on the CT side. Hm, what's it called? Yeah, the perspective. Take this for an example, the ""left shoulder advantage"". | http://i.imgur.com/kVpjg.jpg?1 | Here's an explanation: the player models hold guns on the right side. Therefore holding angles or peeking with left shoulder is more favorable as your model is less exposed. TheWarOwl has this video to make advantage of your perspective: |

			Counter-Strike: Global Offensive tutorial on perspective, how to get the advantage over your opponent using positioning. Dominate the enemy with simple geometry!		

 | And that's well-- unfair. Just like in real life, should I see your eyes, you will see mine, too.As I said earlier, VAC needs some fixing. It's terrible. But again, I still haven't played with any cheaters, so I can't fully review this part yet. Thanks.Final conclusion: an EXCELLENT game. There's bugs and glitches, but it's a fine piece of work. Go get it if you haven't already have it. Already do? Well what're you doing reading this review? Go play!BTW: CS:GO has gotten an update where the voice chat quality has improved.Thanks valve!TL;DR: ayy lmao 10/10♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ -================================================-			"

												Counter Strike: Global OffensiveCounterstrike is a game that slowly ravages and pulverizes your soul each and every time you play it. Everyone starts with the same thoughts when they play CS:GO: 1) 'Pfft. I'm never going to spend money in game buying skins and keys, that's stupid'2) I'm never going to get that angry, it's only a game. 3) 'Meh, doesn't look that hard'Within a month -Within a week - 1) You’ve already have bought a P90 module skin because ""Oh, It's only 30p"" and you begin your slow downward spiral into the CS:GO marketplace, saving up for a knife and opening crates, in hopes of getting a knife which (deep on the inside, deep deep down) you know you're never going to get, and end up spending £10 opening crates, and getting back 50p worth of skins back.  2) You’ve probably already threatened a handful of people with their lives; it’s a game that can turn any lovely human being into a soul eating behemoth within minutes of a match starting.  Get used to wanting to assassinate everyone in your near vicinity. 3) You'll already gave uninstalled the game at least twice, in utter exasperation and in utter hope of cleansing your life from this game. But you can't, you'll always go back.The community is utterly merciless and beastly, with over half the people being angry 12 year old Russians. The betting will completely waste you and rip you of all of your favourite 50p worth of skins. And the trading is completely unreliable, leaving you to deal with steam support, which is 10x more brutal than the game itself. But of course you’ll go back, it’s CS:GO, it’s a drug. A soul destroying, mind numbing, murder spree inducing drug.EDIT: HA. Oops.			"

												CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come.In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators.The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis.Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever.There are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join. Really, if I was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice. It's bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come, something that can't be said for the Call of Duty franchise which is probably its closest rival. Remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year, fragmenting the community. Plus you can customise your weapon skins in CSGO. Surely that's the most important feature?! All they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in CSGO.			"

												I came to this game for my fetish of chickens.  When playing the  game,  I realised that not every map has chickens on it, so I slowly got angrier with the game... The lack of chickens boiled my blood. CSGO made me angry, Until, I found my dream love, Deathmatch. A Chicken on any map, right then.. I'd kick the bots, and chase  the chickens around for hours. Ah, It was so pleasurable, How I would do it for hours on end. The chickens are perfect.  I play this game for hours on end, and the chickens never disapointment me now,  Oh Chickens, how you are my one true love. I can't focus at school anymore..  I only think about chickens, on the way home from school there is a KFC, I walk past it every day, I think of chickens, One time, I literally stopped, and took a fap to one of the  chickens. Ah,  It was so good. ChickensI love themOh ChickensTHANK YOU GABEN5/5 I love chickens.			"

												Most cancerous and stressful game I've ever playedI have nothing against this game, I find it fun at times but I believe the title I choose above suits the game overall very well.List of pro/con of this game:Cons:- There are a bunch of ragers in this game that rages whenever a round is lost, or you don't follow their command.- There are a lot of salty and trash talkers in this game. Some teammates call you names from r*ta*d to f4g and whatever curse words you can think of.- Sometimes teammates gang up to bully one teammate specifically because the teammate is ""ret4rd3d"" or ""bad"" player.Pros:- Fun if you're into competitive gaming. But be sure to be thick-skinned as I listed above, many ragers and salty people in this game.- Skill-based game. Skins and levels do not give you advantages in this game.- There is always something new to learn from new strategies to learning nade spots, gun spray control, etc. Even after hundreds or thousands of hours, there is always something new to learn.

												I bought this game for the chickens, and was not disappointed. After exploring the countless lands the chickens have traveled far and wide, I realized their population was growing too large. The chickens had started to inhabit such horrid locations across the world, such as nuclear plants, and offices without cafeterias. I knew what had to be done. I bought a flip knife off of the steam market, and called PETA. I listened to In the Arms of an Angel in my Microsoft Professional Deluxe Gaming Chair 360 for about twelve hours with no response, so, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery. I cried harder that night than I have ever before. The next morning, with tears in my eyes, I loaded up Counter-Strike: Global Chicken, and I saw a new item waiting in my inventory. My Flip Knife had turned into a Flip Knife Slaughter. At that moment, I realized what a horrible thing I had done. With my hand shaking, I navigated my mouse, and uninstalled Counter-Strike: Global Chicken. I regret everything I have done. I am writing this review to warn you about the chickens, and to let you know I have made a full recovery, and that I have started my new journey in Goat Simulator. Thank you, and farewell.			"

												When I was young, tragedy struck my neighborhood when a bomb went off in a local park. I lost my dear uncle in that accident. Along with my pet cat, two hamsters, one very courageous gold fish, my tickle-me elmo doll, and all of my foil Yu-Gi-Oh cards. It was the first time I experienced tragedy and despair, feelings that cut so deep I vowed to exact revenge upon whoever did this.I trained every day, running 25 miles a week, lifting weights in 15 pound increments, taking protein supplements as well as spending the majority of my weekends at the firing range. I enlisted in the military, only to be turned down because I was ""only a kid.""Then, I discovered Counter-Strike;Global Offensive. A perfect simulation of the events I wanted to prevent and take action upon, I was hooked immediately. I threw away my running sneakers for wool socks and sweatpants, as well as a swiveling chair. I put down my weights and protein supplements for Taco Bell and Instant Noodles. I stopped visiting the fire range and instead purchased a Razer gaming mouse.Worth.My uncle's still dead though. "

												Must buy if you love FPS games!This game is all about personal progression, since it comes with a high learning curve, it's not about unlocking some stupid grip or scope for your gun. It's about you, that has to learn.The game is updated almost once a week with new features and content, Match Making is great when you are playing with friends.The real game for people that love to play competitively, with a team or just solo. There are also casual game modes available for the people that don't like to play competitively, such as Arms Race, Deathmatch, Hostage and Defusual missions which can be played on casual style, or mostly known as public or community servers. These modes are great to learn the game, and improve your play.Pros.◘ Match Making.◘ Skill levels and ranks, play against players of your own skill level.◘ Competitive scene, with ladders and tournaments.◘ The CS feeling, transition from older CS games to CS:GO isn't that hard.◘ Most old maps from CS, are in the game.◘ No perks and other unnecessary clutter.◘ Great spectator sport, easily to understand and interesting to watch!◘ No pay to win model, all items are purely cosmetic.Cons.◘ Match Making 64 tick servers stability could be improved.◘ Game could use some optimization here and there.◘ Cheaters now and then, but that's online gaming for you.If you are looking to improve your aim skills, try out these maps.

												This review will probably trigger butthurts because it's going to focus on the positive things I have to say about the game, you have been warned. Global Offensive (CSGO) is the latest addition to the Counter-Strike franchise and it's also the best-selling one so far. I believe that there are four reasons for it's main success. The first reason is primarily because it greats new players well to an environment already filled with veterans. A great example is the games matchmaking system for competitive players which places you with others that are the same skill level. It seems to work very well from my experience, but it's definitely more comfortable to play with friends (just like any other team-based multiplayer game).The second reason is how well they managed to implement new weapons and features to the game without destroying it's original charm. It's still the same game from 1999 but with slightly more diversity and variation which enhances the experience. The physics of the game adds more depth overall and allows you to throw coordinated smokes and other grenades which adds another layer of gameplay. The third reason is that watching professional teams and matches is engaging and fun. The built-in tools for spectating like for example x-ray makes it very easy to understand, even for someone that doesn't play the game. And yes, you will often find e-sport fans that prefer watching rather than playing because of the viewer satisfaction you get.The fourth reason (and this is a big one) is the ability to customize your items appearance, thanks to a community driven workshop and marketplace. A vast majority of the community is busy buying and selling skins and other cosmetics because it can actually become profitable in the long-run, and uses real money.You will get weekly or monthly updates which usually add, change or fix features, and sometimes an operation which introduces items and maps made partly by the developers, but more importantly by the community. Even if the game is heavily criticized by most, I still see it's charm for being what it is and I recommend this to anyone that likes team-based shooters.TL;DR Game matches your skill with others, it has new weapons and features compare to the older releases while still retaining it's originial charm, watching a proffesional match is fun and there's a marketplace with virtual items that you can buy/sell/trade for real money.If you want tips and tricks, I have a YouTube channel where I focus on tutorials:youtube.com/bananagaming "

												PT-BRHá quase 12 anos um mod de Half-Life surgia na rede desencadeando uma nova mania. Lan houses ficavam entupidas de jogadores que passavam horas jogando Counter-Strike. Quem nunca aqui virou a noite nos chamados corujões? Mais de uma década depois, CS está de volta na versão Global Offensive. E o game, por mais que seja uma cara nova pra um velho conhecido, já me deixou com vontade de chamar os amigos pra virar a noite jogando mais uma vez.CS: Global Offensive não muda muita coisa em relação ao CS: Source ou o Counter-Strike 1.6 que todos devem conhecer. Ainda usando a Source Engine, mas dessa vez com os gráficos atualizados. Mais bonito e com uma interface atualizada, o game não tem nenhuma novidade. As armas são quase todas as mesmas e os modos de jogo se resumem aos mapas DE, de Defuse, aonde os terroristas devem plantar uma bomba, e CS, de resgatar os reféns.Logo de cara ao jogar, me deparo com velhos conhecidos. Mapas clássicos como DE_Dust, DE_Aztec, CS_Italy e DE_Inferno ganharam uma cara nova. Todos mais realistas, mas sem perder os layouts e as formas de jogar conhecidas. A portinha na Aztec por exemplo continua sendo um lugar muito perigoso.Fora os modos clássicos, uma arma nova chamou atenção. Chamada de Zeus, é um taser de um único tiro. Pra que matar na faca se você pode descarregar alguns milhares de volts no CT mais próximo? Outras duas novidades foram as granadas. A granada decoy é a mais barata da lista e não faz nada, senão enganar o inimigo de que alguma coisa pode explodir bem próximo. Já o Molotov é uma bomba que ao explodir deixa uma área do chão em chamas, causando dano a todos os jogadores que pisarem por ali. Bem útil para corredores pequenos e portas.Também foram adicionados dois modos de jogo bem parecidos. O Arms Race é uma corrida em que ganha o primeiro jogador a matar um adversário com cada arma do jogo. Sem times, é um estilo de jogo nos moldes de um Deathmatch. Já Demolition é outro modo parecido em que os jogadores começam com as melhores armas do jogo e a cada sucesso ao matar um adversário, ele vai recebendo armas progressivamente mais fracas até o desafio final com a faquinha.Outra novidade é com relação aos bots. Além de mais inteligentes agora enquanto você espera o fim de uma partida, você pode assumir o controle de um dos bots. Bom pra quem quer entrar na ação rapidamente e não quer ficar esperando o jogo acabar. Muito útil naquelas partidas online em que o time adversário inteiro resolve campear. Os menus também foram simplificados pra compra de armas. Agora ao invés de 8 categorias diminuíram para 6: pistolas, SMGs (submetralhadoras), rifles, heavy (armas pesadas como shotguns e metralhadoras), gear (equipamento) e granadas.O sistema de matchmaking facilita bastante a procura de servidores. Em nenhum momento tive que esperar mais do que alguns segundos para encontrar um servidor de baixa latência dentro do modo de jogo que procurava.Pra quem procura um jogo novo, CS Global Offensive pode decepcionar um pouco, mas, pra quem está buscando algo familiar e passar boas horas jogando um upgrade do velho conhecido, CS:GO pode ser uma bela escolha. O game está disponível por US$ 14,99 (aprox. R$ 31) na Steam para PC e Mac, como também para Xbox 360 e PS3 na Live e PSN respectivamente.ENAlmost 12 years ago a Half-Life mod appeared in the net triggering a new mania. Lan houses were clogged with players who spent hours playing Counter-Strike. Who never here turned the night in the so-called owls? More than a decade later, CS is back in the Global Offensive version. And the game, no matter how new it is to an old acquaintance, has already made me want to call friends to spend the night playing one more time.CS: Global Offensive does not change much about CS: Source or Counter-Strike 1.6 that everyone should know about. Still using the Source Engine, but this time with the updated graphics. More beautiful and with an updated interface, the game has nothing new. The weapons are almost all the same and the modes of play boil down to Defuse's DE maps, where terrorists must plant a bomb, and CS, to rescue the hostages.As soon as I play, I come across old acquaintances. Classic maps like DE_Dust, DE_Aztec, CS_Italy and DE_Inferno have gained a new face. All more realistic, but without losing the layouts and known ways of playing. The door in the Aztec for example remains a very dangerous place.Apart from the classic modes, a new weapon caught attention. Called of Zeus, it is a taser of a single shot. Why kill on the knife if you can unload a few thousand volts at the nearest CT? Two other novelties were the grenades. The decoy grenade is the cheapest on the list and does nothing but fool the enemy that something can explode very close. Molotov is a bomb that explodes leaving an area of ​​the ground burning, causing damage to all players who step there. Very useful for small hallways and doors.Two very good game modes have also been added. The Arms Race is a race in which the first player wins to kill an opponent with each weapon of the game. Without teams, it's a style of play in the shape of a Deathmatch. Demolition is another similar way in which players start with the best guns in the game and with each success by killing an opponent, it gets progressively weaker weapons until the final challenge with the knife.Another novelty is with regard to bots. In addition to being smarter now as you wait for the end of a match, you can take control of one of the bots. Good for those who want to get into the action quickly and do not want to be waiting for the game to end. Very useful in those online matches in which the entire opposing team decides to win. The menus were also simplified to buy weapons. Now instead of 8 categories decreased to 6: pistols, SMGs (rifles), rifles, heavy (shotguns and machine guns), gear (equipment) and grenades.The matchmaking system makes it much easier to find servers. At no point did I have to wait more than a few seconds to find a low-latency server within the game mode I was looking for.For those looking for a new game, CS Global Offensive may disappoint a bit, but for those who are looking for something familiar and spending good hours playing an old-fashioned upgrade, CS: GO can be a beautiful choice. The game is available for $ 14.99 on Steam for PC and Mac, as well as for Xbox 360 and PS3 on Live and PSN respectively.			"

												You want buy this game ? I'm gonna show you somes tips for playing :- Before the match starts, don't press accept. It's a test. - The P in P90 stands for Pro. Like you. - When told to pick up the AWP, stare at it and go AFK. - Don't buy kits, this is actually team death match, the bomb wont ever get planted. - You are amazing with the desert eagle, don't let anyone ever tell you different, not even the scoreboard. - Very important: That thing attached to some guns is called a silencer, and you have to take it off because it reduces damage a lot and will get you more kills. - VAC is a good anti cheat. - Skins make you better at the game. - When a teammate asks for a drop, drop them your handgun. - Never adapt to the game. Don't betray yourself like that. Just do the same thing over and over again and wait until it works. - Dust 2 is the only map in the game. There aren't any others. Don't argue. - If you lose the first round. You MUST ALWAYS Eco/Save. Which means buy armour and an -SMG/Shotgun of your choosing. - When going through doors, always make sure that you block the doors so no one can pass. - -- Ignore the hate of your teammates, you're pro and you're gonna get mad kills. You're also shielding them from bullets. How nice of you! - Crouching doesn't improve accuracy, but do you know what does? Jumping! Be a ♥♥♥♥ing kangaroo and watch the mad kills pour in. ♥♥♥♥ EVERYONE LOVES KANGAROOS. 50 points to Gryffindor every time you change weapons. - State that all SMG's take skill to use from no less than 4 inches away. Your gun is cheaper so it is worse. Rub it in with a teabag afterwards. Especially if you have a P90. - Always tell the opposing team to good luck and have fun when warm-up ends. At half time, treat them like they murdered your family. (Be sure to take note of their nationality!) - If you see a chicken in your gameplay, you absolutely must under any circumstance, kill that damn chicken. It must die. THIS IS NON NEGOTIABLE. - Recoil control is a myth. Like Bigfoot.- If you need to get around the map in a hurry, get out your Negev. - The PP-Bizon is the discount Negev. - Don't waste money on a helmet. $350 is too expensive. You wont die. Ever. - You need to Look at the ground where you are going make sure you don't trip! What the ♥♥♥♥ is strategy??			"

												Ok, I think is time for me to write a honest review for this gameCounter-Strike: Global Offensive is one of the most broken and unfair games I've ever played...but I still love itWhy? well let me tell yaI've had some many feelings while playing this game that I've never had before like desperation with anger, rage,  happiness, sadness, adrenaline, etc.This game became a part of my life, I've met most of my best friends in this game, one of the most important relationships I had was built in this game. I've met every kind of person, the one that rages every second, the leader bottom frag, the Canadian, the Mexican, the Australian, the adult with kids, the kid, the furry, very nice people, the most annoying people I've ever met in my whole life, the smurf, the carry, the bad team, the great team, the ''grill'' and the list goes on.Valve makes changes without any previous advice to the players, and they make changes to the very keys of the game, like the rank system, a whole map, the gun recoil, the sounds of every gun, the whole sound system of the game, prices of some in-game items, and the community usually gets mad at it at first, but we get used to it anyways.What do I mean with ''unfair'' and ''broken''?Well, in matchmaking (prime or non-prime) you're gonna find a smurf, a hacker, a whole queue of griefers, derankers etc,Valve tries to stop this, but I personally feel they're giving up which is really annoying.Another example for broken will be the rank system, is so weird and unfair for some players, when you're Nova II sometimes the other team could be Nova master or Silver elite, or a weird mix of those ranks, it took me around 160Hrs to get out of Silver after the rank system update, even if I had good perfomance, no rank up for a loooong timeIf you're thinking about buying this game, you should totally start with a friend, is more fun in general, but if you're a very first time player joining a competitive game, I can't promise that your team is gonna be the most patient in that game, usually some players demand people that already know all the tactics and recoils, without knowing that you gotta start somewhere, but if you find a group of people that is patient and most important of all if they help you to improve your game, you should stick with them and play together more often. But don't think you'll always play with them, trust what I'm telling you, most of these people meet others and move on, but if you have a long term friendship with someone like that, you're incredebly lucky. now Datsuke, all those things doesn't sound very appealingWell, maybe in paper they don't, but after experiencing a good game, after experiencing clean headshots, long range noscopes, carrying a team, a grenade kill, seeing a hacker getting VAC banned mid-game, clutching the round, getting a kill through the smoke, being called a ''hacker'' for your skill, laughing with your teammates is the most satisfying things ever, winning a close competitive game knowing that you perfom well gives you a huge feeling of success making you play more and more. Besides, you meet very different people, you listen a new accent every day, you learn a new word or a internet term every day, you learn something new in general. Other thing I love about this game is that, learning, there's always something new to learn in every map, every gun, a new position, a new boost spot, a new flash, a new smoke, a new prefire spot. I have 1,400Hrs right now of play time, and I think I don't even know the half of the smokes in Mirage. So yea, this game is really good, most of the time, you're gonna see yourself ragging every now and then, but personally I think is worth it-Datsuke 1/29/2017			"

Main Review This review is carefully worded explanation on my 'departure' from CS:GO and why in its current state, I would not recommend the game. This is somewhat lengthy, so it is really down to you whether or not you actually decide to read it all. So, where do I begin? Well, after reaching the second highest matchmaking rank (Supreme Master First Class) in October 2015 and continuing to play CS:GO from there on throughout 2016, I can say I've had a lot of experience with the game. In that time, I've clocked 1.3k hours and have seen a lot of changes. It's funny really, when I consider the very beginning. For my very first MM rank, I successfully achieved Silver 1. That day I was so excited, only to find out it was the lowest rank there is. Yeah, that sort of sucked. That's not something that deterred me though, because back then, I found enjoyment out of the game and saw a lot of potential that made me want to fight to the top. So, what exactly happened which took that enjoyment away? During 2016, I continued to play competitive CS, that being through regular MM, Faceit or even some ESEA. The difference from 2015-2016, is that in 2016, I began to often take breaks. These 'breaks' often came as a result of several angry occasions where I was confronted by the issues surrounding CS. Those issues are mostly the obvious ones everyone knows about, such as the increasing amount of cheaters, lack of necessary updates, hit registration, community etc.The issues are something I wish to look more deeply into. Alongside hit registration, there is the problem of accuracy as a whole. The fact that you can have an AWP positioned on a players head and somehow 'miss' the shot, yet a player can running headshot you with a pistol is just insane. Further speaking about cheaters, there is the fact nothing is done to truly stop them. The developers of the game are greedy and they know how cheaters can be of benefit to them. When the time comes for a cheater to finally get banned, they can just go pay to get the game once more on another account. Within an hour or so of being banned, they are straight back. That's not the only instance of them being greedy. Take the graffiti update as an example. Instead of focusing on the game breaking issues, they add paints. Now, this brought a lot a nostalgia. Of course though, the first paint you recieve is awful and you have to go purchase more in order to have something that looks good. The limited use feature that prevents you having a graffiti spray for more than 50 uses just further proves of how hungry they are for money. A last point I wish to mention, is that I cannot forget about the unbelievably toxic community. I do respect this one is difficult to control though. Even despite all these game problems, I always managed to return to CS:GO. The reasons for this, as follows, were boredom, the fact that I was not too bad of a player or after I watched a Pro/YouTuber perform really well. These factors gave me the naive idea that I could once again gain enjoyment out of the game. That idea was soon shattered every time, when I was reminded of the state of the game and how it hasn't improved on any of the given issues. Huge attention comes to the game through the eSports scene or the regular community, however nothing changes. In order to put an end to the cycle I got myself in of leaving and returning, I promised to quit CS:GO for good in order to enjoy other games and activities outside gaming. I certainly had a fun time in playing CS:GO, however the increasing issues, lack of attention towards issues and the fact the communities voice is not heard, has currently killed the game for me. Who knows where things will go in the future with this game? I hope things may look up. Side note - I find it very amusing that so many of the positive reviews are full of content that is negative about the game. TL;DR - Quit CS:GO because of cheaters, greedy developers, toxic community, accuracy issues, lack of motivation etc.Small Update - 12/12/16 In an attempt to avoid any comments calling me 'hypocritical', although I will still most likely receive them, I am adding this update. Just now, I have reinstalled CS, this now being a month down the line since having it uninstalled. Whilst I have got the game back again, this review is still relevant as my views about the game have not really changed. The simple reason for me getting this game once more, is the fact I have been requested by many to play. Through requests, I have made the choice to maybe play with some friends here and there if they need the extra player. Chances are my enjoyment on the game will still be low and I do not intend to play this game regularly.			"

												I've played CS.GO for a thousand hours plus. I think, I've clocked in a decent number of hours to offer genuine and reliable thoughts/insights/feedback of the game. If there had to be reasons why i would not recommend this game, it would be for two reasons.Firstly, I have to say that the CS.GO community is horrible. People show no signs of mercy to those who are new (Including myself at times). There are plenty of rude people. Of course i've met really nice people who respect one another but that is just a small minority. Too many people kicking out starters from casual matches for being noob ( not forgetting many times people kick out random players to allow friends to enter the match) and many times sore losers who constantly restart the match just because they died/didnt get a kill/for fun.Secondly, the number of hackers and smurfs that are present now. These people are spoiling the game for those who enjoy some casual FPS and also in competitive mode. Especially for smurfs, I know of many who wish to rank up higher in competitive but simply cant due to the number of smurfs who are actively cockblocking them. And as for hackers, there are those who use it for personal glory or to use it to sell people ranking up services. These people are simply a real pain to the CS.GO community. Need I say more?CS.GO, honestly, is good fun. I do love CS.GO. I have spent many good hours with friends, meeting new people and killing chickens. However the harsh reality of the CS.GO is simply cruel and merciless with people constantly yelling at you and telling you that you're no good, along with a good bunch of hackers/smurfs who ruins your gaming experience.If you cant handle the harshness of the CS.GO community, dont start playing it. However if you choose to enter the CS.GO world alone, good luck. I hope you meet a few reliable and friendly comrades.Until Valve finds a way to counter the problem is hackers and smurfs (especially in competitive mode), I will not recommend it. (Suggestion to counter smurfs: If the IP address has been in a CS.GO server before, he/she will not be allowed to play in the same pool of players in competitive mode.)EDIT: Valve's implementation of having 24 hours cooldown after every 2 wins for fresh competitive accounts is a great effort in slowly down smurfs and catching hackers via overwatch, however i think a more full proof method would be required after once they reached 10 wins.ADDITIONAL NOTE: To the few who have disagreed with my review because 'It's the community you're unhappy about, not the game', here's what i have to say. I strongly believe for a game like CS.GO (in fact any game with multiplayer funtionalities), community is a very large contributing factor if the game is good or not. It is the community that makes the game whole and who it is, especially for a game like CS.GO. I highly doubt people buy CS.GO to play offline mode/bot matches.Though I understand your point of view, and that i should be reviewing the game base on its mechanisms/funtionalities like movement/gun bullet mechanics/matchmaking. However for my review, my aim is to offer my readers a deeper insight to the game than just what you see it on the surface/trailers.At first you might feel that the community doesnt affect you at all, however once you get into the game, i believe you'll change your opinion. If you still disagree, I think its either you havent been exposed enough or you're just darn lucky meeting really nice and legitimate players in your matches. @Shadowdance You're welcome. You gave me the push to write this reply.Cheers fellow comrades.			"

												Counter Strike: Global Offensive, the remake of the classic CS games and not to our surprise, the devs did a good job. One of the lovely things about it, that of had not been kept I seriously doubt the game would be as popular as it is currently, it keeps the mechanics from the classic CS and CS:S and adds a few of it's own, that the original CS and CS:S games could have done with. CS’s weak point was always the graphics, the original games were based of the HL1 engine, which I am sure all you are aware is reasonably old, although it’s added a new range of updated maps, including two operations. The most recent being Operation Bravo in which a number of maps were added to the game as DLC. And once again, Valve have decided to take the generous approach to this, an example is that if the lobby leader has the Operation Bravo pass, and no one else does, everyone can play Op. Bravo, good job Valve, you did it again. What was missing/wrong with this game has been fixed by Valve, which is fantastic. Items have been added, you can have gun camos which is an nifty feature, although many think it's turning into TF2, which is a valid point, but Valve need there money, if you take a look at the price of the game, it’s not exactly the same as COD (ew) which has a hefty price tag of £40 ($60 I think) and CSGO managed to do fine at £12, which I think is $15 in the US.Sadly I did not play the original CS, I have however obviously seen gameplay, and watched friends play it. I have played a small amount of CS:S and compared it to CSGO, which was considerably easy, some of the main differences are simply that the problems that those games have/had have been completely eradicated from CSGO which is brilliant. Such as small things that could be exploited in competitive games, such as the saving mechanic. In CS if you die, you lose all your weapons, they will be dumped on the ground for another enemy to come along and pickup, players if they knew they were going to use they would hide away from the enemies, so they would be able to keep there gun for the next around, the problem with this is that they would still get money from doing this, and therefore be exploiting the system in some peoples opinion, it was recently fixed that instead of getting money if you lose and you’re still alive you simply gain $0.The CSGO match making system is an exceptional feature, the ability to play against players that are at the same skill level is much better than being forced to browse through thousands of servers in attempt to find one that suits you with a enemy team you can play against, and it is a fun game for both teams instead of one team getting obliterated by the other. Matchmaking works by waiting till you have 10 wins or 9 wins and a draw on your account before being rewarded with a competitive rank. Here are all the current ranks available in game. http://www.pro-hl.com/images/prohl/csgo_ranks.jpgMany people seem to think that this is like COD, you simply rank up from playing the game, no this is not true. You rank up as your skill improved, if you play well for a few weeks, and you finally get the Gold Nova you’ve been wanting for ages, and then you proceed to play awfully for a long time there is a very likely chance you will be deranked sadly, it’s for the best, you will be matched against players who are around the same skill level.Recently a feature that allowed you to watch your recent games has been implemented into the game, this is in now way “ground breaking” it’s been done by other games before, but they have there issues, although I have not got round to actually trying out this feature I have been told that it appears to be working considerably well. The watch feature is great for those who enjoy re watching those moments of which they pulled of that beautiful AWP shot, or got that 5-kill ace.I would like to say in this final paragraph, of the 250 hours+ I have played of this game I have seriously enjoyed (almost) every moment of it, sure there are some hackers, but you have to make sure to report them and they will be dealt with. All the factors about this game are good, but as all games go by, they have there problems, sure if CSGO has improved graphics that would be nice, and if *breathes in heavily* VALVE WOULD ADD 128 TICK MATCH MAKING SERVERS… this has caused some annoyance for me in match making, if you don’t understand what’s so bad about 64 tick, I suggest you watch this video:

Anyway, I highly suggest you buy this game, apart from my small rant at the end, and game is fine, good game mechanics, graphics are sort of good, I supposed most of the maps are well balanced, there are a few that I suggest you shouldn’t play though. The game has a small price tag, which I am sure will attract you to it even more, especially when it’s on sale at 75% of!Hope you enjoyed reading my game review of Counter Strike: Global Offensive, and that this assisted you in making the decision of whether to buy the game or not.I would appreciate it if you left a comment about what you thought about this, was is a bad review? Why was that, whats wrong with it? "

												Seems like Valve has completely forgotten about this game. After 2.5k hours + I can honestly say it is one of the best games I have ever played. However, now I'm at the top end of the game, you struggle to find a legit game where there isn't any cheaters. You have to go to third party websites which charge monthly to play without cheaters, and even then there is still the odd few. So if you're a casual gamer looking for a time wasting game this is for you, however if you're willing to invest thousands of hours into this game to try and reach the top I wouldn't recommend it until Valve sorts out their anti-cheat (Which will never happen).Keep adding Stat-Trak music kits and gloves to a 64-tick broken game Valve.

												Absolutely not recommendable because of the insane ammount of hackers.Today i dropped From Global Elite to supreme and lost 3 games on SMFC against Rage Hacking kids. In one game we were 8:4 ahead and 1 opponent left, joined back 3 rounds later jsut to announce he quickly downloaded a hack. So after he ragecarried the remaining rounds getting 11 MVPs we obviously lost. Don't get me wrong there are some strong players in this game who hit insane shots but with my almost 6 k hours of Counterstrike experience i can tell you that at least 5/7 matches have one hacker +, not even counting the insane amount of players using some kind of radar hack. In fact Valve doesn't even care. Do they try getting rid of the Hacker Problem? No, not really. Instead they keep adding skins and cases you have to pay for. Overwatch function seemed nice in the early state, but watching an overwatch session, you can't hear the ingame voice chat, which pretty much makes it useless. How do you want to hear if some1 keeps playing music ingame, uses a microphone of 1937 or keeps flaming? Or a hacker calling ingame? No, all you can see is a Scoreboard and the PoV of the Suspect, of course  you are not able to switch the teammates. Counterstrike Anti-Cheat is so damn useless, a friend with 1 year programming experience was able to build a hack, which was undetected for over 2 years.Another problem ist the community. Most players below LEM  are queueing with 2+ mates only speaking their own explicit language. So why the hell is there no ""Team-Language"" Option ingame to fix these kind of things?All in all CS-GO is a  nice skill-based shooter with high potential, being ruined by a company only interested in milking the cow and a highly toxic community. To enjoy this game you would actually need to buy ESEA or just not play any kind of competative matches, which would make cs go kind of senseless.Cheers			"

												CS:GO is a highly competitive skill-based game. This is what makes it so great, learning the maps, all of the different tactics, improving your aim and managing the economy. This however, can be a long grind. Every map has its own calls, grenade spots to learn and positions to play.CS:GO runs great(although every updates costs FPS), has some good sound design, and decent graphics for an older game. Updates come regularly to add stuff and valve keeps improving the game. A big downside of CS:GO however is the big amount of cheaters. If you don't link your phone number to the game and play in ""prime-matchmaking"" the game can be literally unplayable. This can be very frustrating, especially when you're doing your best to rank up and improve. Aim and sound play an important role in CS:GO, More than in most other shooters. every gun has it's own recoil pattern to learn and it's own unique playstyle. Since CS:GO requires alot more tactics than most other shooters, aim is more important aswell. Having your crosshair at the right position means you can take your opponent down alot faster. Alot of practice, and playing aim maps helps and using your sound to locate your enemy's footsteps gives you a big advantage. The CS:GO Esports scene is also massive, milions of people follow it and it's a great place to learn. Use this to your advantage. Wanna know those new tactics, boosts and smoke/flashes? Watch some games! You can honestly learn alot from watching the pro's play. Now ofcourse, you saw this one coming, the community can be really... annoying. Especially at lower ranks the community is full of toxic kids, people who have no idea what they are doing and teammates who refuse to work together. This can be harsh, especially because CS:GO heavily relies on teamwork. Thats why i recommend playing this game with friends, and practicing alot. The faster you're out of those low ranks the better! Once you get a bit higher you'll see the community gets better and better(with the occasional toxic/clueless player ofcourse). People work together, people give usefull information and are just a bit more nice in general.Next to competitive, CS:GO also has some gamemodes for people who just want to have some fun and don't care about ranks or tactics. Gamemmodes like: Gun-Game, Team Deathmatch and Casual are great for this and the thousands of community servers offer cool things like: Surfing, Aim training, roleplay, minigames and more!Now would i recommend CS:GO? Yea ofcourse! Especially for the small amount of money it costs. Just dont expect this to be another casual shooter. It's a highly skilled game and requires you to put in alot of time to improve. Pick this up with a couple of friends so there is less chance to be matched with annoying teammates.			"

												Let me preface this just a bit.I love Counter-Strike. I've met so many cool people over the years I've played, had so many laughs and good times, it's been a blast. However, I'd say about 95% of that was purely through casual. So after 500+ hours in the game, I decided to try and get into the competitive scene. I got a few buddies together and we were gradually progressing through the silver ranks (I know call me bad,♥♥♥♥♥♥ etc.) and we were having good fun. We'd win 3, lose 1, but the point was that it was fun.However, as we got higher and higher up, it stopped being fun. The reason? Absolutely♥♥♥♥♥♥poor matchmaking and security from Valve's end. I can understand one bad game or 2, but it got to the point where it was consitently terrible. At this point I had stopped queing with less than a full lobby. Me and a couple friends would get qued up with people with 900 ping who were basically worse than bots, they'd leave, and then its a 3v5 for the entire match. Experiences like this, are not fun, at all. The worst part though, is the amount of painfully obvious hackers in this game. VAC is the poorest ♥♥♥♥ing excuse for an anti-cheat system I've ever seen. One hacker will basically carry an entire team, and 9/10 times the enemy team won't have the integrity to kick the blatant hacker, because he'll carry them to the next rank. The most you can do is report them, but with how cheap this game is, it's no problem for people to make another account and rinse-repeat. Valve makes more than enough money on this game to justify having a better anti-cheat system. It is honestly one of the saddest examples of a company not giving a♥♥♥♥♥♥about their community that I can think of in the gaming industry. Say what you want about EA being a money hungry ♥♥♥♥♥♥ company that hates their fans, I guarantee you that you won't run into as many hackers on official Dice Battlefield servers than you will an official CSGO server. That's just sad. Again, I love this game. If you want to play casual or community or what have you, you'll probably have a great time learning the quirks of the game, learning the maps, and engaging with the goofy♥♥♥♥♥community I've come to love/hate. However, the competitive scene is pure cancer. I do hope that Valve reads these, even though I highly doubt it, because I truly want what's best for this game. Tks for reading.-Sen			"

												Community is ruining this game. I live in Russia and happen to play on russian servers. This is incredibly awful experience i must say. Russians are the cancer of this game. They are everywhere and ruin the community and the game for others. I wish CSGO would cost like 30-50$ on Steam and that would definitely help to cut the amount of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in it. I wish there was an option to choose who to play with but again that wouldn't help because russians are everywhere. It saddnes me because i fed up with screaming kids and chavos and im quitting CSGO because of it. I can't enjoy the game while i have to listen to angry rednecks on the mic or screaming kids for 40-60 minutes. Despite the outcome of the match i still feel ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because they trashtalk 24\7 and rarely able to play. ♥♥♥♥ this game.PS. I must notice that there is like 5% of cool russians that know how to play and are actually nice but alot(not all ) of them are just ashamed to be russian so the hide their identity from others. These guys are a huge minority and this is truly sad.			"

												How do i aim down sightEDIT: it has been years and the devs do not update the game with iron sights or a sprint feature...EDIT2: I have finally reached global elite but I see no option to reset my rank and start over. Is this happening to anyone else?EDIT3: I cant set a loadout when i go into a game. I also cant see any perks. Glitch?EDIT4: After 3000 hours i finally got my 100th awp kill, but did not unlock an attachment for the weapon. Do i need 150 kills? I just want extended mags honestly.EDIT5: I decided to get some skins, but they are not adding any stat boosts to my guns.  Where is the microtransaction to add stats?			"

The community is terrible.CompetitiveScreaming Russians in every game. Going full ♥♥♥♥♥ storm on anyone who isn’t listening to them.12-year-old kids (or kids in general), who think they are the best, and promotes themselves to be the IGL, and starts flaming and vote kicking anyone who isn’t listening to them spam the mic chat with ""GJ GJ"", ""HIS BEHINDE YOU WITH A AK-47 AND HES ONLY HAVING 69 HP LEFT YOU SHOULD PICK UP THAT AWP NEXT TO YOU NO WAIT USE YOUR PISTOL- AND I KILLED MYSELF BECASUE I HAVE TO KEEP SPAMING WHAT EVER HAPPENS SO IM MAKING SURE YOU GET IT- OH MAN WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ DID YOU DIE DONT YOU HAVE A HEADSET BLA BLA BLABLA""CasualPeople in casual vote kicking people for being afk for approximately 2 minutes, Jesus ♥♥♥♥ing Christ. It’s a ♥♥♥♥ing casual game not a competitive match. If the person is doing something that takes time, ofc they are going to play ♥♥♥♥ing casual instead of a comp.Again, kids. Kids spamming their mic with trash. When they are dead, they proceed to mic spam positions of the enemy team, but the thing is: kids are stupid and do not know that when you are dead. People will not be able to hear you, only the other dead players.People spamming the chat with ""N00b! u suk uninstall game!"" in a casual match. Seriously, it’s a casual game; half of the teams are players under rank 3, or players warming up.  As you might have guessed, English is not my native language. I might update this review at some point Edit: So I've noticed in the comment section, that people think I have a problem with this. I don't, its a review, like a heads up for the people who are going to, or consider buying the game, so they are kinda ""prepared"" for whats ahead of them. I'm perfectly fine with this, jezz guys, I've spent more then 900 hours in game. "

												Pros: -It's a huge e-sport-very well done maps-it has it's own weapons system that's very unique and adds an incredibly high learning curve.-It keeps a classic arcade feel to the game so it's easy to pick upThe game has seen worse times, but even still, it's terribly flawed.Cons:-Unless you're playing in a LAN, where everyone is in the same room, you're going to have tons of hit registration problems.-Valve's 64 tick servers are great for lower ranks from Silver to Master Guardian. But once you get past that, you've probably accumulated some skill and an understanding of the game and how it works. Quite often, while playing a competitive matchmaking, you'll shoot at someones head, see blood, and absolutely nothing will happen in your favor. 128 tick servers exist, but you need to go to a third party to use them, which seems pretty excessive just to play the game with a few less problems.-The community is the most toxic, vile, absurd- you know what. Just get a dictionary and every single word that has a negative connotation will pretty much describe the community that plays this game. -Hackers EVERYWHERE. Hackers are insanely abundant and carry on without a care in the world. They don't worry about getting banned because they have no problem buying the game again, especially if it goes on sale, and just hacking all over again. This is probably the biggest reason Valve doesn't do anything to REALLY try and put a stop to it. But why would they? It makes them money when someone finally does it get banned so who cares about the legit players who try to enjoy the game for what it is, right?-There are a certain number of bugs and exploits that are in the game, that haven't ever really been addressed. For example, a persistant sound bug that sounds like someone is running when in fact nobody is there. (I believe they have fixed the running audio glitch but there are many more issues yet to be addressed.)-The developers put out updates, and just when you think it's something useful, like fixing a bug or exploit that's been making the game unfair, they just add more sounds! Or adjust sound levels! Pretty much nothing that matters to serious players. Conclusion:The game at its core is a decent game. But you can't play it the way it's 'meant' to be played with just the game itself. For actually decent servers, and a SLIGHTLY more tolerable community, you need to sign up with a third party website that hosts their own servers so you can play the game. But those matches don't count for anything in the game itself, it's pretty much just a platfom to work around. If you're going to get the game just for a time killer and don't plan to take it serious then great. But otherwise, don't waste your money or your time.I manage(d) four community competetive servers that are fairly popular, and I used to have a blast playing on them. But now whenever I go into the servers, it usually ends in me having to ban the ENTIRE lobby. I've quite literally yelled about how tired I was of babysitting because that's exactly what I had to do. I'm very accustomed to seeing hackers and cheaters from monitoring so many for so long with my time on the servers so when I play matchmaking matches the hacks are very easy to spot out. 'Professional' players have been banned for hacking before for crying out loud.The first few hundred hours of my gameplay were pretty fun. The learning curve made it challenging and different and that's what I enjoyed. But the higher rank you get and the more serious you play, the more terrible everything becomes. I've made it to Supreme Master First Class, (Rank before Global Elite, highest rank in the game's ranking system.) and I can't say that I want to bother trying to get Global or playing anymore in general. At this point, every other match has a hacker or at the very least a griefer or extremely toxic person that wants to spoil your day. Whether a hacker is blatant or not, it becomes pretty apparent when someone's playing unfairly. All in all, there's no sportmanship or respect in a game that would do extremely well with both of those things, and the lack of feedback from developers in helping clean up the community or create better servers is very unsettling, especially for one of the most popular games on Steam.But you don't have to believe me, play the game and see for yourself. But you've been warned.			"

												Hello and welcome, new player. Allow me to reveal some of the likely outcomes of you purchasing this game:The 'Cannon Fodder' (40% of all players) - Never really good enough to make it past Nova 3, constantly flaming, talking sh it, changing their names and pictures to things increasingly racist, blaming hackers, smurfs, lag and weapon choice of oponents for just what is a mixture of adderall exhausted reflexes and having a shi tty gaming rig from 2002, frame dropping on source games. Can be easily identified by it's trademark defence mechanism, when being called out for being bad the Cannon Fodder will attempt to convince it's team it has been 'Trolling' all along.Habitat: Dust2The 'Enthusiasts' (30% of all players) - A wide range of Skillsets from Nova Master to around Legendary Eagle, these players can perform consistantly and at least show a basic level of human decency,  most of them will give an unenthusastic hand job for $2.49USD because they feel they are 'due for a knife' or because 'my friend told me he had a feeling' Will one day be doing unspreakable things for a japenese businessman on a glass coffee table to pay off gambling debts that can be traced directly back to a greedy cu nt and his case racket.Habitat: Dust2, Nuke, Mirage, CacheThe 'C unts' (15% of all players) - A curious breed, come in two distinct flavours 'Hacker' and i mean legit hacker, not hacker because he saw your shadow in bedroom on dust2 and prefired you, you fuc king mook, These are players who either used to or almost fit into the 'Enthusiast Category' and were turned into soulless, spineless dic kbags who cannot win on skill or merit. The other flavour, less cancerous but just as annoying 'Smurfs' people who play at levels far beneath there skill to boost their friends, ruin other peoples day for the joy of being a cu nt or to boost their dwindling ego that is one Sylvia Plath poem away from a stomach full of painkillers in the bathtub.Habitat: Dust2, Nuke, Mirage, Cache, Train, Overpass, Inferno, Cobblestone, Office, Assault, Any Operation MapsThe 'Pros' (15% of all players) - Professional Esports player OR someone who has played enough CS (usually in excess of 1500 hours - 9 weeks to us humans) to get to a level where they know every smoke, every flash, every angle, every strat on every map and to you i say kudos, kudos on mastering a video game to the point you know it as well as your mothers disappointed face when she looks at you knowing that while normal people are studying, working or contributing to society in someway, you were hunched over your keyboard for the 7th straight hour of the day, mouth breathing in pleasure as that voice says 'Counter Terrorists Win'Habitat: Mothers basement11/10 would play again.

												Once upon a time on de_inferno there existed a single chicken on A site.  ""I must get to my family!"" said the father chicken.  Navagating through all the stained karambits and battle-scarred asiimovs will prove quite the challenge.  As the chicken creeps up the stairs into apartments he sees the glass shatter in the first room to his right.  He scatters down the hallway anxious of what will happen next.  There are 3 mysterious people wearing potato sacks on their head and must have applied way too much eye shadow.  He sneaks past them and makes it into the crawlspace.  ""I can't believe it! I may actually live to see my family on B site fishing in the koi pond.""  AWP shots are being exchanged down the middle of the battlefield and the chicken hears flowerpots shattering here and there.  As he gets to the exit of crawlspace he sees another potatosack creature hiding behinds a haystack and scuttles down into banana.  ""Who the hell drove a taxi down here?"" says the chicken.  He makes it down the dark ally and glances over to see the remains of his family.  They are but feathers floating in the burnt sushi in the pond after a thrown molotov.  ""I.. I.... I can't belive thi-BOOM-.""  A cheeky CT sits in his spawn with an AWP as he giggles in his chair after murdering the poor creature in cold blood.  Please, I beg of you, these chickens are endangered creatures and risk thier lives to venture through the city just to meet thier family again..			"

												Beautiful game. First bullet accuracy of rifles is completely perfect, as is the miniscule RNG factor which doesn't affect anything at all.Dedicated servers with more than 10 people don't have hit registration or choke/latency issues in the slightest.Community is filled with mentally stable, rational, humble players dedicated to having fun while improving, not merely ranking up and flaming enemies and/or teammates. VAC is literally flawless on this game, never before have I encounted someone who I think twice about being absolutely 100% legitimate.CS:GO developers have truly pruned this game into the best FPS of all time with their consistent efforts into listening to the community, bringing regular updates, game balancing patches and exciting new operations into Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.Also goes well while coming down from a weeklong amphetamine induced psychosis. Never before has yelling at a computer game been so thrilling!			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												At its core Global Offensive/Counter Strike is a brutal shooter which in its prime was probably the number one cause of broken Microsoft mouses.The emphasis on death is probably the only aspect of this series that has kept me around. It creates an atmosphere that games like Battlefield and Call of Duty hasn't been able to reproduce. On the outside Counter Strike looks like a simplistic shooter but the learning curve is steep and will challenge even the most seasoned FPS gamer.The game is simply tactful; it’s brilliant when you’re alive and even when you’re dead the game is still fun to watch other players.Global offensive is a competitive game and a casual one, although for casual gamers it's probably better to find community servers over Valve servers. There's a huge market place now for the items in CS:GO and not only that, there's third party websites and support for numerous other avenues these in-game items have createdYou will also find on Twitch CS:GO is consistently one of the most streamed games and boast numerous competitions, if you need any convincing watch a stream, watch a competitive match and see for yourself.This game is simply a must try and a game every gamer should have in their library. Overtime you can even make back the money spent on the game from the game itself.			"

												The game is a money pit filled with hackers. The rank system is a joke.Overwatch is a joke.VAC is a joke.There is no anti-cheat system for this game.It has a tired engine. (12+ yrs)It's a game based off a skill game. Just when you master a skill or skills they just throw in another broke update and break more crap like changing the whole gun skill set (joke)Adding the R8, A gun never in any Counter Strike, Is maybe all you need to know about the brain trust behind the game anymore. Best idea ever !  (Not)I know lets add Flintlocks,Muzzleloaders,Catapult and Slingshots.They will claim to fix things like broke spawns (Dust DM spawn) still broke !DM (Deathmatch) has the Worst spawns of any game i have ever seen.After one of the great updates you will have to play through weeks of people who have pings from another planet.Random lag spikes or micro stutters, do to it's not optimized well.Could it be a good game ? yes ! If they had someone who had a brain and played it and then fixed it and left it alone  other then adding the money making garbage (I know you only care if it's a cash cow).Legit players suffer while hackers roam free. (I know you don't care cause you make more money) not banning people  hence people having so many accounts...I have 1 account and proud of it.I know people will hate on me and I don't care it's the truth.......By the way i'd spend more money through Steam but after seeing what this game has turned out to be and the stupid taxes crap from selling the junk I get from game (not real money by the way, The real money has already been taxed) and the lack of caring about hackers.    "" I'll just save it"".If your a legit player wanting to learn the game and enjoy the game you will be disappointed and penalized.If you a hacker or a scammer you will love this game and be rewarded.....If you look at most of the positive reviews they are from people who have close to no hours played.If you look at the negative reviews they are from people who put a lot of time into the game.(1/7/15 update)  They added gloves to CSGO... Must have been why everyone was deranking, The old ones wore out.... Can't wait for Stat Trak Clown shoes...!For all the noobs that cry that I have so many hours.I've played since beta so that would be before the release August 21, 2012. The game now, Is not the game it used to be. Started going down hill once they added skins, Not for Steam but for players.If it was still good I'd have many more hours then I do.And yes I still play a little when my real good friend asks me too. Other then that I dont touch it anymore.......As soon as my friend is done playing CSGO I'll uninstall....!""I never leave a friend or a man behind"" (In other words I don't bail on my friends)After reading a lot of the reviews I found that so many of them are negative with the thumbs up icon. So it ends up this game receives more positive reviews then it should.If this game was left alone, With a fixed rank system ""Except for the mostly ulgy skins they add for more money""  people who really cared about learning and playing like a team the way was ment to be played !This game would be great........ There is a Mute/Block for thoses who don't want to know how many times your mom has had sex with a 12 yr old. But 90% of everyone you face has brand new account and has the reflexes of god and X-Ray vision of Superman. No one gets banned. Hackers will say ""I heard you"" or it's ""my smurf"". In any case if your Global and on another account and play as a global on a nova account then your a cheater and a scumbag.The Facts and nothing but the facts........!                                             Oh did i mention the game is a joke !			"

												Pros :- Great teamplay if you have friends- Updates to keep upgrading and improving the game- Not being call of dutyCons:- Toxic community that makes CoD community feel like scholars ( occassionally )- Hackers dnt get banned all the time even if its crystal clear- Vague ranking system that seems not fair most of the time.- I was legendary eagle and fell from grace due to ranking system update, its like getting a good grade after studying so hard, only for the teacher to decide to curve down all the grades becoz all the class passed.. its not fair, make ranking up harder but dnt screw the players- Revolver.. really ? .. seriously.. why ?- Overwatch not tempting- Playing solo sucks- The Idea of the campaign sucked big♥♥♥♥♥br>- Almost 2k hours and I dnt feel the game is rewarding me for my dedicated service.. give me a medal or smthng people :P- I can't eat while playing.. big problemAs of April 7-2016 I retired from this game, its addictive like drugs.. left me frustrated alot, too many griefers and an increase in the number of hackers.. the type of hackers that smokes mid on d2 and takes out 5 guys with an awp inside the smoke.. that type of hackers.. Im focusing on finishing many games i left unplayed becoz i simply hunger for great stories			"

PLEASE NOTE THIS REVIEW IS TOWARDS THE COMMUNITY, NOT FULLY TOWARDS THE GAMEPLAYREMEMBER THIS REVIEW IS A PART OF MY EXPERIENCE, SOME OF THE THINGS I SAY HERE ARE FACTS, AND SOME ARE MY OPINIONSWho the fu** are you to judge CS:GO?Mr_Oren, And from my 420+ (xd) hours in the game I think I can write a review and be an hero after this review.I don't recommend this game not because of it's gameplay, rather, it's Community.You see, the community is SO dumb.Reasons for my statement:1) Unjustified Kicks (resulting in ban)The last time I played the game (about a week ago) I got banned for a week for doing accidental freindly damage, it was anyways the last round of us losing (10:15) for us, and yet they (The players, not Steam) kicked me at the END OF THAT ROUND, which got me banned for a week (for getting kicked of too many games).And YES I DO UNDERSTAND you don't get kicked by the algorithm (even though I did not) and get banned for 30 minutes, then 2 hours, etcStop stating that.2) People leaving in middle of competitiveI cannot tell how many times happend to me that in a middle of a game, people just left our team! and left us to lose.Now, I understand if people have to do things in real life, real life > CSGO after all, but at least make sure you have an hour or so before you start a game to make sure you won't ruin an experience for someone else.2.5) ExampleHell, one game the thing happend to the enemy team, but rather than one guy, 3 people left from their team, I felt kinda sorry for them.3) Use of specific weaponsThe community also seems to think that using ""p90"" or any of the SMGs is bad, or ""silver"", even though it's complete BS.""Either you live enough to be called a hacker, or you die and be called a noob""4) Game searchAnother issue I have with CS:GO is the fact that games are not checking for people from your country, how many times it happend to you to play a game with 4 people that are spanish? you're DEAD.My point with this is that I think the game should determine what country you are from, and play with people from that country.5) SmurfsAlso smurfs are a problem, a HUGE UNFAIR problem, and if you say ""It'll make you better to fight against a smurf!"".. I don't know what you smoked, but that's clearly BS.6) GameplayThe gameplay itself IS fun, it's VERY fun to play, but just the Community's ruining the game for me.Another issue (That is mine) is that I'm so addicted to this game.. I just can't leave it alone, I keep trying to stop playing and I come back, hopefully now I won't come back with my 420 hours in the game.7) Unjustified kicks [p2]Another problem in the community is that people vote to kick others, just because they're ""noobs"", which is so BS.Also Hitboxes are SH**, people with ping higher than 200 should not be even playing (or be moved to a different server)8) ""You have sh** K/D ratio! you're not allowed to have an opinion!""Now for the thing I hate the MOST about the Community, is people using the K/D (Kill / Death) ratio to determine whether you can have a fu****** opinion or not!As an example:Me: Man not good idea to rush itEnemyOnOtherTeam: 5/10 ezJust STOP.More Points* I will not download third party software to enjoy the game, I think it's stupid that I need to download third party software to actually enjoy the game and play with less toxic players.* Some people say ""Oi mate, simply play with friends, will resolve your problem"", I disagree, since many things happend even with your enemy team like reason 8.Besides that, what if I don't want to play with friends / I don't have Steam friends that own the game?Honorable Mentions*All the people who downvoted this review just because they love the game and I dont.*All the people who make ""reviews"" with a joke and get like 96% positive, or a moron that leaves the game idle with IdleMaster for 10K hours and then uses it is a joke.*Steam:

												Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has 5 games inside of it. Deathmatch      If you are new you have to play this game. even people with 500+ hours might play this game. In deathmatch you are          able to learn how to use the weapons and how to improve your aim. That is why there is a possibility to turn of random weapons to you can choose only 1. PLEASE if you have 100- hours play deathmatch. (Dont use SCAR-20 to mutch.. people will hate you!) Demolition      In this game you have to kill people to get new weapons. Here you will learn how to plant a bomb. and how to use maps. you will learn you have to look back and look everywhere so you wont be killed. Also it is a good way to use multiple weapons. Not like deathmatch 1 weapon youre good with.  Arms Race      This game is hard. You need to kill as mutch people as you can. There are 16 levels. every level is a new weapon. kill 2 people to go level up. the first one who is at level 16 gets a knife. If he kills someone with the knife he wins. the maps are small and there are a lot of people. here you learn how to use every weapon (every weapon shoots different) (this will help you in Casual and more important  Competitive.) Casual      This looks like  Competitive. You have team mates and you have to win. sometimes its 5 vs 5 6 vs 6 8 vs 8 10 vs 10.  They maked Casual easier. Them damage is turned of. and you wont get a Cooldown. If you want to play this: in the beginning this will be hard. and you wont get mutch kills. if you play more it will get better. You choose 1 side and you will stay the whole game that side  Competitive       This mode is for players with atleast 300+ hours ( I Thinks.. and a lot of players think that 2). Everybody plays this serious. Cause here you play for ranks. team damage is turned on. Its the same as casual. Kill enemy and plant the bomb. 15 round as Counter-Strike and 15 rounds As terrorist. the team who wins 16 rounds wins the game.What I also like about this game is the face that everyday over 100000 people are playing. Every mode are people. you meet every day new people and sometimes new friends. every week you get 3 drops. ( most of the time 2 cases and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapon worth 3 cents. sometimes a weapon with is worth more).  if you recieved the 3 drops you have to wait till monday then they will reset it. ( drops are random)Also there are cases you can open. this is addicted like hell. In a case there are weapons skins. some are worth nothing others are worth 50+ euro.. if you are very lucky 100 euro/dollar or MORE! EVERY ONE WANTS A KNIFE skin.weapon skins are useable in game. you can buy them are you can open cases. ( if you dont have mutch money buy the weapons.. not the cases ;) ).last thing. Operations and championsships. ever couple months there will be an operation. that means. you have to pay 5 euro/dollar. and you get: 5 New maps. Lots of Missions. New weapon skins. That is cool cause this will make sure the game will stay fun.Also every couple months there are contest between the best players of csgo. you can watch them live! thats cool!I give this game a 10 out of 10.

												Maybe the only FPS where it truly boils down to a game of pure skill. No bullsh*t perks or kill streaks, no auto-turrets, no air strikes. If you want to win in Counter-Strike, you have to learn the maps, play smart, and have fast reflexes. Since you work for each and every kill, it's much more satisfying than other current gen shooters.			"

Date of Review: 9/27/2014CSGO is a competitive team based shooter with highly refined mechanicsThe Good:    (+) Gunplay is based on skill. Knowing how to control the rifle is the difference of winning or losing a gunfight.    (+) All weapons are balanced in the sense that they each have a time, situation, or role that they should be used in.    (+) Movement is fluid and precise and if mastered, can give you a competitive advantage.    (+) The competitive maps have been tweaked specifically for competitive play in mind.    (+) Competitive isn't the only game mode. There are also community servers which host a variety of game types that are fun and interesting.    (+) Game overall takes skill to do well. It's not so easy to learn, and very difficult to master. This makes it pretty addicting when you're trying to improve your skills in the game.    (+) Chickens.The Bad:Honestly, there's not really anything negative about the game in my opinion. But I'll just address the common complaints of CSGO.    (-) CSGO is hard. Seems like every bullet misses when you're aiming right at the guy. (This is where you would take the time to learn the game, but otherwise a common complaint from people.    (-) Hit-reg is messed up. I always see the blood splatter but it never counts as a hit. (This is just a problem with the default 64 ticks server. You can join other servers with 128 tick to get better hit-reg anyways. It's still better than the 10 or 30 tick rate that Battlefield and Call of Duty has though.)Well that's all the good and bad I could think of for CSGO.Ack4orge Rating:10/10PerfectWith the perfect tweaks to the gunplay, maps, movement, and gun balance, it refines the already highly refined gameplay of the past Counter-Strikes that's been out since 1999, making this one of the best competitive team-based first-person shooters on the market.

												Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.			"

Posted: January 31, 2015
												The review you are about to read is alot of mixed feelings.. Notice i have 3k+ hours.. I have been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 with some breaks in between focusing on school or relationships and while i have played plenty of other big titles growing up such as the Grand Theft Auto series or the Battlefield series i have always come back to the one game that i know and love. If you are really into shooters and have tried this game than you too will probably agree that CS has the most consistent replayability factor and is arguably the simplest yet most skillful shooter out there. Unlike games like Call Of Duty or Battlefield there is little to no debris covering your screen or random hiding spots that people camp behind at all times. Yes it happens but to be good in Counter-Strike Global Offensive you must capitalize on rushes and support your teammates in completing the objective. This is the ULTIMATE teamplay game and has just recently had an incredible boost in professional cs go tournaments concerning prize money and the viewers watching them. I stayed up all night til 7am to watch either Dreamhack or ESL (forget which one) That one match alone had about 300,000 viewers.. whereas CS Source was barely keeping their head above water with Professional tournys and teams in their day. So whats the problem?? The up until just recently awesome people over at Valve have become so focused on aqcuiring new players and revenue reguarding things like skins, cases, keys, taxes on items we sell on the marketplace, passes for new maps with objectives and even new copies of the game. Somewhere along the way i feel as if they have given up on the integrity of the game because it seems like every few months they put the game on sale for 5 bucks or so even though it is already insanely cheap only $15. I dont think you will find a single player in CS that will tell you they have played another game that is better or even EQUAL to CS and its replayability for $15.. That being said over time of course people will accuse other people of hacking i.e. wallhacking/aimbotting so if the game goes on sale for 4.99 even if a percentage of the people accusing others of hacking buy the game cheap just to have an alt account to get revenge and also hack thats a problem.. Now you think about Valve putting the game on sale a couple times a year and of course there will be MANY people that buy 5 or even more copies of the game! ..Just to hack and boost their friends.. This is becoming more of a problem for legit players like me. I literally feel like a superhero in a world full of villians. I am quickly seeing the decline of great real fun real skilled matches in CSGO. Everytime i join a competitive match there will from now on ALWAYS be a new account on the other team.. What is their excuse? ""Oh im just smurfing.."" You can even tell there are many more people hacking in overwatch these days. (overwatch is a self review cs go system of random people to determine if they were hacking or not) 6-12 months ago you would find overview cases kind of a challenge to decide on and most of the time would have some pretty nice skins. Nowadays 9/10 Overwatch cases they have absolutely no skins on their account or .20 cent skins to make it look like they do have skins and they couldnt POSSIBLY be hacking. Hackers do this because they KNOW there is a very high chance of them getting banned and losing these skins forever. Valve states that anyone Vac-Banned will NOT be able to get it overturned for any reason whatsoever. So tell me why during one of the major CS GO tournaments that just passed Pasha from the pro team Virtus Pro he was being filmed in real life over his shoulder and got vac banned in the middle of his match. simply said no i am not hacking and got his account UNBANNED. If he was at a lan tourny with everyone watching then he couldnt have been hacking right?? Wrong. It is going around that there is an undectable and unseen hack that is built into the map from the workshop(not exactly certain on the details) even when you are watching his screen in real life you would not notice.. Even worse than that every time valve does a wave of vac bans which is not nearly often enough there comes another undetectable hack that people find almost right away. The major point i am trying to make on this subject is that Valve makes MILLIONS on us for each skin, key, case, tax on the items we sell in game, operation pass and copy of the game we buy. and they still have a mediocre anti cheat system.. thats like the NFL making billions of dollars and letting anyone onto the field during the game because as long as they have a football jersey on they wont get caught. If you ask me they are stealing our money and are completely content with people buying 1,2,3, 10 new copies of the game with their excuse being ""smurfing"" (smurfing is when you log into a diff account with a much lower rank and completely destroy the other team to have ...fun?) It's pathetic and lowers Counter-Strike dramatically in my eyes as the greatest competitive game ever on PC. We must not forget it did pave the way for games like COD. Valve needs to stop being content with the $$$$ they are raking in and take back the integrity of the game. If that means hiring a whole new department to look into this and take serious action then so be it but for now if a friend just got a pc and asked what game he should download i would NOT recommend Counter-Strike.. Again i have been playing for about a decade and i myself come close to stopping playing all together sometimes sadly i am so attached to CS its not something i can easily do. Valve knows this and Valve is taking advantage of us. END OF STORY.			"

They will ridicule you for your every mistake, loose your games intentionally, and try to break you down. The problem with the community is not everyone, but is a large enough population to effect you.			"

												I can both say yes and no to recommend this game.Counter-Strike, can be good with friends but if you try to play a lot of random games to climb the ranks you will encounter the second most toxic gaming community ever. You get every kind of stereotype on here from the kid who slept with your mother to some guy calling everyone a b*tch N*gga. With well over 2000 hours I can not recommend CS:GO in its current condition. Why is that?-Servers. The servers are horrible. 64 tick is not enough to play on. You will often encounter bullets that do no damage yet there is blood on the walls behind them. Their performance is lack luster and lots of servers are doing a stutter/stop as of lately or the registration is just... Non-existant.-Hackers. They are still running rampant in CSGO. ""Prime"" accounts are still subject to them. It seems as if VAC is not working at all. You will encounter a LOT of them from Silver to MGE. (There are smurfs but you can tell them apart from hackers very easily. I enjoy playing smurfs as I see it as a chance to see what I need to work on to get better.)-Toxic community. This game relies on three very major things. 1. Aim 2. Communication 3. Listening. There are very seldom times that you will come across a team that is willing to Communicate and Listen. From my experience (MGE or lower for the majority) A lot of people do not communicate because they are talking too much and when you ask them to hush for the rest of the game and to type, they throw hissy fits as if their mother just denied them a cookie. If you try to communicate with people and call stuff, and they blame you for their death becuase you're trying to communicate where the enemies are. ""One B"" - Teammate dies - ""OMG WHY DID YOU SAY HE WAS BE WHEN CLEARLY THEY ARE A!""  Everyone ALWAYS tries to blame others instead of understanding that it was just good timing on their end. -Gambling addictions with opening cases. Opening cases can be fun at times. However, the absolutely horrible prices for keys makes it a very expensive risk if you get a simple item that is only worth $0.02 on the CM. A lot of people waste their money here. NOW FOR THE GOOD-Meeting awesome new people. I have met quite a few people on here. Some of the best people I have ever had the chance to encounter. It was awesome! We still enjoy kicking back and having a few beers. -Gaming Tournaments. TONS of LAN parties play CSGO or CS1.6 and it's an absolute amazing time. Everyone gets super serious but also come out of it with smiles, win or lose. -Hand + Eye coordination improvement. My hand and eye coordination used to be utterly horrible. However, MAAAAAAAANY years ago, when I first got CS1.5 my hand and eye coordination improved drastically over the time. Would I recommend this game? Yes and noYes - Having fun with friends is great!No - Everything stated that was bad. And it grows the more and more you play.			"

												Community is the sickest, so here I have examples of any type of players:Silver haters. The matchmaking system are combine players in accordance with the skill group. People have found it fun to create a general idea of silvers as a garbage without brains and skill. For someone it is an accurate description, but not for all. Ranks are not for showing off.Boosted ones. They are too good for this world, they are smart, handsome and incredible. But Gold Nova 2. And they think their peoblem is always with teams that not_so_good. Eventually they are ruining games with their conceit and lack of experience. Skin haters. People that consider it's their business to count other people's money. Also, they are confident high price skins owners are bad because... IT IS FUN TO MAKE A MEME ""GE INVENTORY (pic with sand dunes) /SILVER INVENTORY (pic with knieves). Ha-haaa, dem memes...BOT lovers. Some people think the BOT will be better than the player that didn't clutch the round with 10 hp left and all enemy team alive.Common idiots. Actually press f1.I WILL FIGHT TILL THE LAST BREATH ones. For some reason they never surrender. A competitive game is played between the teams of 5 players. If one of them leaves the game prematurely, he receives a penalty, and the team devoid of player has the right to end the game in advance. Valve gave them this feature, but they prefer to waste time and lose because of the numerical superiority of the enemy team.Tryhards. Goes without any words :>Team players you can count on. People that will give you info AND call idiot, noob, retard etc. at the same time, when they're already died and whatch you. They don't know what morale is. And manners.The community most valuable members. They want to be the bride at every wedding and the corpse at every funeral. This is not about CS:GO only. If you have a negative review, they hint you correctly you're an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, that can't handle the game, even though you have 100% fair achievements. If you want to take part in a discussion, but don't know some things, they won't explain it, they are likely say ""go away"" instead. Ultimate pro gamers. For example: you lost the round 1 by 1 with the enemy, because couldn't handle aim? Dead one pro will cheer you with the words ""omg what an aim noob"" or something like that. I don't know where they take such a weird ideas of omnipotence or invincibility... Everyone have equal abilities here.Smurfs. People that find it fun to play with people that can't resist. Welp, as you see, nothing in this community is friendly.Russians. Do you think I forgot?) Russian ones are odd. They always ask this question ""Русские есть?"". This questions is very mystical, because even if they get positive answer... they keep silence. So, do you want to met... or you just show off your nationality? I know russian language and I know what russian think of USA* (English-speaking people=Americans*), they are not silent about it. Thank you for your attention. Now you know what Counter-Strike: Global Offending is.			"

												The spiritual successor to ""The Secret of Monkey Island™"" (titled cs:go) is one of my personal favourite point and click adventures of all time; wether it's the engaging puzzles or intricate story, this game is always sure to provide hours upon hours of family friendly fun. the game's premise is that you're either a ""CT"" or a ""Counter-Troublemaker"" who's job is to stop the ""T's"" or ""Troublemaker's"" shenanigans, such as graffiti, egging houses, or the such. All these are of course now animated, comparative to the simplicity of  ""The Secret of Monkey Island™"". All in all, a great game and tons of fun. But it's kind of a rough port, and i'd reccomend purchase on ps3. 8/10			"

												This review was written directly after two bad games, so it's pretty biased as I wrote it in the heat of the momment :p I'm currently in a love/hate relationship with CS:GO and I keep putting it down and picking it back up months later after my rank is gone.Don't get me wrong, CS:GO is a great game. But the ammount of smurfs and hackers in lower ranks ruin it for me The past two games I've played today I've been lobbied against a team of hackers, and a 3.2k hour smurf. Players who smurf are annoying, but it's still possible to win the game, as my team almost did. But when versing hackers, it's pretty much a pointless battle. Back in 2015 this was probably my favourite game to play, and at that time I would have reccomended it, but the recent updates to the game have been pretty trash in my opinion, there were a few good ones here and there but I'm not going to talk about those, as the bad extremely outweighs the good. The sprays for example is just a pointless way to make money for valve, and the new gloves, I feel like they're just trying to make a skin for everything in the game, and make you pay for it, even if you you're not forced to, it's still a little annoying thats its there.This is just my opinon on the game currently, my opinon could change in the future and if it does I'll be extremely happy.Feel free to comment on anything you disagree with :)			"

												This was once the best game on Steam, until they dropped the ball. They created a juggernaut through skin drops which led to gambling and conjured the dark seedy side of the net. When it grew too big for its britches they cut off the gambling leaving everything in disarray. The games neglect was all too evident. All that remained was the crippled gameplay itself and websites that sold lifetime cheats and a terrible ranking system. Many will swear by this game but the truth is that the game is tied to a lifestyle of cheating and you are competing to become the best cheater. You are not to speak of this side of the game it is a not so secret club with a single rule, don't talk about it. That is the awful truth of CSGO where even pros are caught using hacks and major competitions are won by showcasing your unknown glitch. If this sounds great to you then this game will be a favorite for a long long time. After all Delta Force released in 1998 and people are still cheating in it right now. That's just a cold hard truth that the community wants to hide from their non cheating prey.For the rest of us we have departed in search of greener pastures and memories of what was, for a time, an amazing game. As the market for skins continues to drop due to a lack of betting skins on matches, the last of the fair players will lose hope as reality sets in. This game will not extinguish quickly as the the majority of players purchased lifetime cheats and have multiple accounts. This becomes apparent as you get better and more people turn cheats on against you. This is called toggling as they turn their cheats on and off just often enough to win crucial rounds. You will hear people talking about toggling all of the time and people complaining that they are too obvious and offering tips to better conceal their deeds. After all cheaters are just a big happy family around here. There is no strategy worth the effort to counter people seeing through walls. Who do you think is going to rank up you playing legit or a wallbanger? With that in mind who do you think is ranking up if hardly anyone is caught? It is obvious right? If Steam ressurects gambling you may witness a resurgence but it is the loss of truly skilled and talented players that are the real story. Pro players voiced their frustrations over bugs and glitches only to be ignored. Valve released spray paint cans as some type of absurd diversion to the state of the game itself. This games community is a toxic pile of lies. If you choose to doubt me and embark on your own journey I invite you to read the novel John Henry. That will be you my friend, with your trusty slam hammer, competing against a machine until you die from exhaustion. Such is the state of the game and until sites aren't selling lifetime cheat memberships with timers showing they have been undiscovered for years... wtf ever I'm done with this game. If you like scammers buy this and watch as you are bombarded with phishing scams. You can convince others that I am wrong but after 750 hours on this game I am not listening to it another second.The real ranking system:Cheaters on topScammers in the middleLegit players at the bottomAt no point will competition change as you will play the exact same people on different accounts no matter what ranking you are. It's just a big joke.			"

												I only got this game because everyone literally forced me to get it, so I got it, I played it. It was good in the beginning, until I started playing competitive, and why is that?Well as I walked into my first competitive match, I got into a match with 4 Russians on my team, and enemy team consisted of 3 Russians and 2 Americans that only spoke Russian. When the game started I walked 4 steps towards mid and got instantly sniped through doors, and that was a teammate! My team lost half their players before we met the enemy...So after that game I came to the conclusion that all the Russians wanted was to♥♥♥♥♥♥my ♥♥♥♥♥.Pros:+Great maps, especially when they're filled with Russians!+I got A+ in Russian after owning this game for a week.+I can now insult my friends in Russian because they don't understand♥♥♥♥♥♥+I finally fit in(This review is more about my life than the actual game)Cons:-Russians, duh-Russians with guns!-democracy!!!-Screaming Russians-Not enough RussiansI wonder how many dislikes I can get by saying this?

												I don't know what to say about this game, so here is a recipe for pancakes, Ingredients:4tbsp plain flour (about 100g)1 large free range egg½ pint semi-skimmed milk + water (about 300ml - ¾ milk ¼ water)Pinch of saltButter for fryingHow to make pancakes:Sieve the flour and salt into a large bowl and make a well in the mixture.Break in the egg and stir to make a breadcrumby mix.In a jug add 1/3 of a pint of milk and top up with water to make 1/2 a pint (200ml milk, 100ml water) - this makes a lovely light batter.Add the milk and the water mix bit by bit, beating constantly to avoid lumps.Tip:*If you have a food processor just throw all the ingredients in and zap until smooth!Pop a large frying pan over a medium heat.Add a large knob of butter (roughly 50g) and melt.Pour the excess butter into a small bowl and reserve it for later.Using a ladle pour a spoonful of the pancake batter into the hot pan and swirl to get a full covering - cook for about 1 min each side (it's ready when it's easy to flip over).Serve immediately with sugar and lemon or other exciting toppings. We love cheese and Marmite for an extra British twist! Delicious!!			"

												Dear Counter-Strike Players,After a long period playing this game (~1000h) I think I have the advantage to write a better review than my last!First I want to say thank you Valve for making a nice game like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive!BUT:There are some things Valve has to change really fast!1. Cheating:There are more and more cheaters every fu***** day! The VAC-System isn't as save as it should be! I hope Valve is working on it!2. DDOS-ing:I think the Valve-Servers should be very save, but then there is the DDOS-ing! How is it able to get the IPs from your opponents this fast and DDOS them! Please fix the Serversecure!3. Smurfing:Through all those Steamsales you get more and more smurfs! Highranks buying a new account to play against lowranks and get really horny about it! I think they should make an IP-Based system where the rank is linked to the IP or something like this!4. Patches:Patch after patch, the game is getting worse! They nerf every weapon till the weapon isn't playable anymore! With the maps you have the same problem!5. Serverproblems (also Steamserver):Steam and Valve aren't able to fix their serverproblems, so the game isn't playable because of laggs and disconnects! Also the cooldown you can get is very unfair! This is fu***** s***!6. Community:The community isn't as good as I hoped. Most of the people are pretty unfriendly.Over all:Counter-Strike isn't playable anymore! And the higher the rank the more hackers you get! Please fix the things I listed above and make the game playable again! And I know that Valve can't fix the community, but I hope the community will get better!PS: I'm from Germany, so there are maybe some spelling mistakes!			"

												The game is awesome, but the community is utter trash. Your games will be filled with ragers, trollers, griefers, and cheaters. There is no real attempt at curtailing such behaviour and the report system might aswell not exist.			"

												I used to recommend this game but I can't anymore. CS:GO is broken in a number of important ways right now: Pistols desperately need balance. Netcode and servers are horrible.VAC essentially only catches the dumbest hackers. Overwatch more or less an admission that VAC doesn't work well but is also useless. Movement speed and run-and-gun gameplay style completely at odds with theme of tactical shooter. Tapping often offers little reward for risk in current spray meta (exception being AK at distance).Jumping accuracy? ... Really? Why encourage jumping in a tactical shooter? SWEET REPLAYS!!!R8 revolver... feels like an April fool's joke that never ended and now is just sort of a troll gun.Non-Prime matchmaking a huge deterrent to new players - testing ground for hackers now. Prime matchmaking seems like an awkward fix to broken VAC and honestly still plenty of walls/etc.Smokes still frequently glitch allowing players on one side to see through them.I won't list toxic community as a negative of the game because there's nothing the developer can do about that. For all of you who want to cite Riot Games' efforts to improve player behaviour ask yourself this one question: have their efforts worked? No. League of Legends has the most toxic player environment I've experienced even compared to CS:GO or Dota2. Competitive games bring out the worst in a lot of people. That's a people problem not a developer problem. Anyway, in its current form I would not say that spending the considerable time to become skilled at this game is worth it as you will constantly be let down by wonky mechanics, bad servers, and the inescapable reality that there is a constant ebb and flow of hackers in competitive that make any sense of true competition feel absent. All in all, CSGO will have you asking yourself: am I having fun or is this actually adding negativity and stress to my life? The answer will vary from game to game but in the long run I think most people play this game out of habit rather than having a consistently positive experience.			"

												I had a lot of fun some years back in the 2012-2014 reaching the rank of Supreme mostly playing with friends but also as solo. I came back this year to try the game again after some absence from the scene. WTF has happened? This game has the worst community possible, it antagonizes the one that LoL has but I guess here things are worse. If you don't speak Russian you are doomed to play in competitive servers with people that don't speak English at all in about 80% of your matches, these guys use the VOIP system to speak Russian even if they are just 2 out the 5 players in your team, their only communication is shooting you or try to kick you if they think you do something wrong.DON'T GET ME WRONG HEREI have a lot of Russian friends through other games and they are really nice people.Apart from the Russians another portion of the community is immature people, they go harsh on teammates, bash them, trolling them and in generally trying to prove something, these disputes in many cases end up with the player being either the attacker or the defender leaving the game or getting banned for friendly fire, about 80% of the times you play you will end up playing a 4vs5 Match (at least in my DMG and LE levels that I played this year). This is a team game, you can't win by yourself but most people don't get it. If you reach a higher level of skill it doesn't mean that you are also a good player in terms of tactics and strategies.Another negative thing is the 64tick rate servers that the competitive system uses, I believe this is set to allow distant players to have a decent ping and/or to save resources for the servers. This thing ruins the game too, it makes aiming really funny, you will understand If you ever go on a LAN server or play on a 128 tick rate server, this will result into playing a totally different game. The way the rates work now is that the attacking player has always the advantage as prefiring won't leave the defender time to react.There is huge but in all this:Are you willing to pay a subscription?If you have 4 dedicated friends to play the game with I guarantee you that you will have an excellent time if you decide to go play somewhere where you pay to play like ESEA and FACEIT with a better community. There you will find descent people that value their money and are willing to play in a higher level without having to take all this *love* mentioned above.This review is written in frustration after playing 5 consecutive 4vs5 games only with non englsh-speaking teammates. And this scenario this year doesn't happen for the first time.			"

												Both the competitive and guilty pleasure in my entire Steam library, CS:GO has captured both these conflictive aspects of mine spectacularly, as I've enjoyed over hundreds of hours, playing this joyous game. From the teamwork, player rankings, campaigns, competitive gameplay, music, replay value and much more, this game is a king amongst most modern, multi-player FPS' games and still going strong even over just a measly three years.Just like its predecessors, the player assumes the role of either a counter-terrorist or a terrorist, both with their own unique missions, depending on the campaign in general. The newly added campaigns, Deathmatch and Arms race is a great exclusive extra if you're just a casual player, whereas there's the competitive session for the more experienced, intense and determined players out there.With every match starting, you're brought into ''Freeze time.'' where you have a wide selection of guns in your disposal, just ready to be bought, either with the money you've earned by killing opponents, or indeed losing a match respectively, still giving the losing team a winning chance. While with your team, you could stick together as there are power in numbers, or go alone to face your opposing enemies. I wouldn't talk for every individual player out there, as I've seen power in experienced players. Trust me, I have witnessed a Russian veteran take down an entire army of 5 opponents, all in the same vicinity...and yes, he was a rageful one, indeed.I also enjoyed the updated graphics and more immersive game environments. Definitely pushing the Source engine to its absolute limits but doesn't go too over the edge to miss the most important aspect of any game; the gameplay. The gameplay is near to being absolutely perfect, as you can easily navigate, along with the controls are fast and (sometimes) responsive, on the other hand, the radar being very relieable even in the most threatening of times, since you can detect enemies close to your location and either wait for them or hunt them down yourself or with your precious, numbered team. Just remember to tune down your mouse settings for aiming, as it does help much more.The original music used is also a big step up, as it literally puts you into that zone of actually being prepared for one living frenzy of a match, each time around. From the beginning beat as you select your weapon and gear you will bring into combat each time, or from hearing the threatening tune of the planted bomb ticking away down to its initial explosion, the music definitely makes the game feel and look more surreal than it already is. And with an added bonus, with the Steam music player at its peak in popularity, the update with the musical kit useable in-game was a great move, as you can listen to classic music, as you slaughter your opponents joyfully.I've also enjoyed the gun descriptions that tell the real-life history and origin in a very formal, informative and creative way. The statistics of the weapons also help out the player to figure out what weapon they will bring out, either if it means getting close and personal with a shotgun, sniping away with a rifle from a distance and even switching to second-hand pistols, when reloading your main gun that takes precious time, along with how they flesh out damage with a great, controlled accuracy. As you can tell, this game serves many different ideas, strategies, preferences and possibilities to each and every person who are against each other.And yet another great thing to note is that this game gets multiple, yet fast updates. The homepage of the game mainly dishes out the latest CS:GO news, such as upcoming streaming matches with clans from different countries going toe to toe, or special deal offers on those elusive cases, if you're ever tempted to test your luck and hopefully get a rare skin to add to your growing collection of weapon skins. You can also create clans and watch your ranking system build up with friends and even create lobbies to secure that you will be in the most competitive games with your mates behind your back.But my primary complaint with this wonderful game has got to be...the community. Yes, a lot of aspiring programmers and artists do a swell job at creating fantastic weapon skins and maps that when judged are simply classified as prefessional, but I'm not talking about those great people. I'm talking about the brash players that exemplify the dunning-kruger affect; where unskilled players rate their own abilities much higher than accurate and compare other players, in a much more biased fashion. It gets annoying pretty quickly, so I would usually block the most revolting swines who do this.All in all, this game is a big, big, big recommendation from me and if you think I'm lying, just check top-selling games list at the start of the Steam page. There's a reason why this game is on the high ranking list, and that's due to its high and successful popularity.			"

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a brilliant game, there is no doubt about it, defintely my favorite multiplayer game that is available today! However, a game should be played purely for the sake of fun, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive can be the perfect combination of competetive and fun, but whether or not you actually manage to get any enjoyment out of it constantly feels very doubtful in the games current state.Simply put, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a modernised version of the Counter-Strike everybody knows and loves, only this time it has a ranking system and ""balanced matchmaking"" so that you always get a ""fair game regardless of your skills"", sounds awesome, right? Too bad that at the moment, matchmaking seems to be broken beyond repair. I will elaborate, but first I just want to throw out there that the gameplay is fantastic, I am not here to dispute that fact, but rather that a game that relies heavily on it's community to truly thrive is ultimately damaged by it in the long run, even if there are still a handful of people that do great things for this game, see the people that dish-out endless tutorials and tips such as WarOwl & 3kliksphillip for example.9 times out of 10 you are likely going to have at least one player in the game who is either smurfing or cheating, (let's not even get into the odds of you getting a ton of griefers in the game altogether), some quick online searches will show up some results about how the anti-cheat measures are making very little difference, especially when some of the most proffessional and famous Counter-Strike: Global Offensive players have even been found out to be cheating somewhere down the line. Checking the player profiles after a game will also turn up a shocking amount of players that have had VAC bans in the past, and while that doesn't necessarily mean they are still cheating, it is not out of the bounds of possibility. Another annoying issue in this game like many other multiplayer games is that if you want to play with people that aren't touchy teenagers or pre-pubescent children that do nothing but give out grief, racial and homophobic slurs, then your best bet is to play it with a group of friends and hope that no cheaters or smurfs managed to find their way into the enemy team. But hey, if you play this game with the right people, it is still a great experience, whether you win or lose, I have met some great people in my time playing! Unfortunately these great people are vastly outnumbered by the bad ones, at least that was my experience. I still believe that the good outweighs the bad, just ignore the idiots if you can, even though it will be impossible to do so if they resort to team-killing and intentional friendly fire (which you will see a lot of), I guarantee you'll be using the ""Block Communication"" feature almost every time. I know as well as the next person that it can be frustrating to have somebody on your team who isn't very good or just new to the game altogether, but these people paid for the game just like everybody else and thus deserve to play like everybody else, instead of kicking and griefing them, try helping them instead. Everybody was new to Counter-Strike at some point in time and the veteran players aren't going to stick around forever, remember that. So until Valve are able to do something about all the cheaters and smurfers that currently plague this game, I can't really recommend it, regardless of how much I like the game itself. It's situations like this that make me wish Steam's review system had a ""Mixed"" option cause it really does pain me to click ""No"". For a game that is fun and competetive, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one to buy, but whether or not it is a fair game will depend entirely on what straw you draw in the matchmaking. If you're having a lucky day, you may actually get a good and fair competetive game on the go, but let's just say the odds aren't exactly in your favor. If one day the matchmaking has vastly improved, then I will happily rewrite my review and give it the positive one it deserves, but until then I'm afraid I can't.Another issue is that in the update cycle for this game, things often end up even more broken than repaired. As of right now there are some serious problems with frame rate drops and hit detection, which you probably imagine would take the highest priority on the developer to-do-list, but no. Skins, cases and all other forms of micro-transactions always take the highest priority. I appreciate that Valve is a business and that their goal is to make money, but nobody is going to stick around to play a broken game when they eventually get fed up of it like I and so many others have. We paid for this game and it is your duty to maintain it and make sure everything works like it's supposed to! On one final personal note, I really wish that there was some kind of option to disable skins in-game and maintain only the default models. They're bloody ugly and ruin the immersion, but this is only a personal gripe.The short version: Amazing game, but ruined by it's community and poor maintenance.Update: As of January 2017, I decided to try playing this game again to see if things have gotten any better. I'm afraid not, it's still in poor condition, hit detection is even worse and the community is still as toxic as ever. But hey, at least the cash-cow is still flowing in the forms of ""Glove Cases"" now, right? Sigh...			"

												(Update 24th of december)It's just not what it's used to be anymore..Community:COD was most likely known for the game with the most toxic community full of kids, but since cod got worse a lot of kids came to csgo and here is the problem. The CS community became more toxic now and it's quite Annyoing for people to have a squeaker in their team. Their voice isn't even the problem.. It's just that they feel like KennyS and claim the AWP as their personal weapon for the whole game and if you tell them to stop playing AWP, you just get a ''♥♥♥♥ you'' or ''shut up idiot'' in response. Now let's be honest, how many times did your mum get ♥♥♥♥ed by 8 years old squeaker? According to the game probably over 10 times am I right? Don't get me wrong, it sure as hell is funny to make those kids mad, but at some point, they become a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Competetive:I used to play competetive with a full team, but sometimes you just don't get 5 friends to join and you just start looking for a game with 1 or  2 randoms. When you and your 2 friends found a game, you realize it was a mistake to play with 2 randoms, because either they are russians who were boosted and only speak in their language or you get 2 salty kids. Pretty much both russians or kids is bad, because once you lost 3 or 4 rounds, they start teamkilling and as a result they mostly receive a 7 days cooldown. Then you have a bot in your team and the game is probably lost. You are starting to feel upset and you are frustrated, because this match was a failure.Elo system:Don't have to say a lot about this right? A lot of people complain about the elo system in csgo and so do I. You're on a 8 games winstreak and then you lose 1 game and get downranked. Having a good rank is everyones goal in CS:GO, but ranks don't really say anything about skill anymore, because of all the smurfs. Yet you're eager to have a rank like LEM or supreme or even better... Global! Skins:A unnecessary feature which makes the game look nicer, but some skins just cost as much as a car in real life... I know, you don't have to get skins, but so many people buy those expensive skins and try to make other people jealous.. I think, it's kinda sad if someone wasted tons of money just for a digital item. Now skins are not just expensive, the other bad thing about this is the amount of scammers in this game. Now if you look past all of those negative things I named in this review. Go ahead and buy this game. I won't stop you. This game can be a lot of fun with friends. Yet if you try to play it serious, this game becomes a really frustrating experience. CS:GO is broken, because of it's community and the latest updates weren't a big help either. Weapons like the M4A1-S that I used to play a lot are literally unplayable for me now oh and the messed up HUD in casual is still not fixed aswell as the spawning in teammates glitch. Hey but whatever instead of fixing those things Valve decided to add a new gun to this game. 10th december the R8 Revolver was added to this game and you were able to kill 5 people with one bullet. It caused a lot of hate, because this gun was like a freakin' AWP. They reduced the damage now though, but was it really necessary to add a revolver?Oh also. Save your ''just because you're silver'' comments okay? Thank you.			"

												A game with a community which I have absolutely no hope for.Let me elaborate on this one: the game itself is fun. But given that this is an online game, the fun gets taken away by other players. You have trolls, cheaters, smurfs (=high-ranked players on new accounts to play against low ranks to feel proud of themselves), and generally other ******** who think smacktalking players who are worse than you is fun.Pair that with the salty teammates you get during competetive games, who get angry at you for not winning certain situations they wouldn't have won either.If you plan to buy this game, be prepared to meet the worst kind of people you can imagine.In other words: the players ruin an otherwise good game.

												This game was good at the beginning. It was really great and I enjoyed it a lot. Right now the game is complete♥♥♥♥♥♥and here are two main reasons: Awful community. Most of the time you're playing you're gonna get a dumb kiddo who has no idea about what he needs to be doing. Sometimes you'll get ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ players who're just trying to ruin your game. Or sometimes you will get smurfs who're just ""trying to chill"". Valve don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the community. What does Valve do? Of course! They're making sales and selling more copies of this game to smurfs and cheaters. The worst players I've met on MM were: Polish, Russian, French, Turkish and German(No offence to any nationalities, I'm just sayin'). Useless updates. The updates are completely useless. Developers of this game do give a single f*ck about its community. They just want to make money. They do not want to fix the hitboxes, they do not want to fix their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers, they do not want to fix bugs. They just want to make money. The game NEEDS fixing. What do they do? They are adding more stupid cases and skins. They are changing the f*cking sounds for no damn reason. Yes, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive could be a great game, but not until the developers understand their mistakes and start giving a f*ck about its players.			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												The ""third"" game in the critically acclaimed First Person Shooter series that have shaped the PC gaming industry for years. Originally a mod for Half-Life turned into a stand-alone, had a Soruce sequel, and now Global Offensive. Counter-Strike 1.6 has long been one of the most played steam titles, seeing as the entire Steam platform was created with Counter-Strike in mind. Today Global Offensive have actually surpassed the original game in player base, something that Counter-Strike: Source failed to achieve.I was never a hardcore Counter-Strike fan, I always had a buddy or two that were better than me. Therefore I can't tell you the perspective from a experienced CS player. A lot of players were disappointed in Counter-Strike: Source because it did change too much of the core mechanics. Others were disappointed that the game did not change enough. Global Offensive apparently somehwhat succeeded in both those things in some mysterious way. Some core 1.6 players like it, and the game is relatively friendly and easy for newcomers. Of course there are still players who disagre and still value 1.6 or even CSS better.Counter-Strike Global Offensive offers the same team based versus mode, where you spawn, buy items, and you are free to move around the map to find the enemy players. The maps are never too big, and you always spawn in the same area. The main objective is to kill all enemy opponents, but there's also the classic objective of planting the bomb, or saving the hostages - depending on the map. Once you die, you have to wait for the round to finish before you respawn. Classic maps such as de_dust and cs_office have found their ways into this title as well. Same goes for most of the classic weapons, AWP, M4A4, AK-47 etc.Beside the classic competetive team vs team, there's Arms Race and Demolition. Arms Race is a adoption of the classic ""Gun Game"" game mode from the original Counter-Strike, where the players are in a team deathmatch, and each kill will level up your weapon to the better. Demolition is a cross between Arms Race and classic ""plant the bomb""-objective just on smaller maps. There are also time-specific events such as Operation Payback and Bravo, where players must buy a pass to play on community made maps and to support the creators.Just like any other modern Valve title, this game comes with all the Steam features including Steam Workshop, where people can share their created weapon skins and maps. Just like Dota 2, the items does not change the gameplay in any way, only cosmetic stuff. There is also weapon drops in game that players can get, with different range of rarities - To bring the Team Fortress 2 lootfest to this game as well.Pick this game up if you are looking for a competetive, as well as casual, multiplayer-only first-person shooter. There is plenty of room yet to learn this game, even if it seems hard at first. "

They say that it’s easier to tear someone down than it is to build someone up. It’s true. It’s ♥♥♥♥ing true how no one does anything about it. They go with it and call you ‘a ♥♥♥♥♥♥’ or ‘♥♥♥♥ing garbage’ and so on. No one cares about the kid who just sits there doing nothing wrong and gets called that. No one cares about the one who isn’t as good as the rest, and sits in spawn while his team constantly calls him gay and a♥♥♥♥♥♥head and constantly pointing every single thing that he’s done wrong. No one bothers to give lending advice or compliment what good he’s done. They just tear down the foundation of him. They don’t bother mending to the walls of the household; they’d rather fire the cannons at it. They would rather choke you with aspersion than give just one compliment. The world would much rather lead the child to end of his short life, and throw away all his progress and the [wonderful] things he would accomplish later on in life. The world is sick, to me. I just wish people would cast aside the brute’s club, and wield the carpenter’s hammer. The game itself is good, however, the community sucks.			"

												Love it or hate it. I do both. Story: Police versus Terrorists. You play on either of this sides.Differenced in gameplay: You want to secure something from beeinng blown up or blew it up.Alternative you have to secure hostages or stop the SWAT securering them. Gameplay: Easy to learn but hard to master. Forget about running with an Assault Rifle and give headshots to everyone like in other FPS. For this you have to choose the P-90. No seriously it took some time to know how to control the spray of your weapons.Just pressing the fire button is not enough here. CS is still one of the most skill and game-sense required games.To help you mastering this you can download and play training maps from the workshop.(Smokes,Flashes,Recoil,Aim) Community: Difficult!There are a lot of nice people but also the most toxic guys you can imagine.Stay calm & be friendly (at least try to be).And for the sake of your money do not open any cases!♥♥♥♥♥/10			"

												 ""Do you recommend this game?""[Yes] - [No] = For this instance, I will press 'Yes', purely in my own opinion, but in some degree, I don't recommend it either. This review will be longer than all other reviews I've currently done. My apologies, no TL:DR either. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a strategic, and competitive game, with an insane marketplace, and in-game economy that builds from it's players. It requires the team to work together in-order to get the win, and of course, knowledge of the maps, and properly developed strategies in order to go against the enemy team and secure the win.  You'd think it's just that, right? Wrong. This game requires insane amounts of research, and memory, precision, and skill. To be able to control recoil to perfection, to knowing smokes, and grenade spots for each of its types. Making manouvers in order to outsmart enemies, or maybe just trick them, and decieve them. Of course - you can get help for all of this online, YouTube and such, or learn it yourself as you gain hours progressively. A huge issue with CS:GO, is the cheaters and smurfs that overrule the game, in large quantites. The cheaters, of which claim smurf, or the smurfs, or so claimed to be, which are cheating. Let's discuss. Smurfs:  Commonly, ranked above DMG, wishing to purchase a secondary account, to play in lower ranked games. Usually unable to play their own ranks, so they play the lower ranks to feel like they're better at the game than they actually are. Whilst in those lower ranks, accused of cheating a lot due to hours, and rank. ""I'm a smurf"" doesn't cut it anymore, I suppose. These people, when played against make it even harder to rank up after ValvE updated the lovely ranking system, making it a hell to understand, and/or rank up at a decent rate, despite if you're good or bad at the game. Playing against an actual smurf, whom of which is above DMG, whilst you're in Gold Nova, or Silver, is going to be one hell of a time for you, as they will likely have a better understanding than you would at Silver / Gold Nova.  Cheaters:  Many people mock, and curse the VAC system we currently all know and love. It doesn't work as well as it should, and everybody can admit that, with the amount of people cheating. The only issue is, that people now legit hack. This means, they do cheat, put have configurations/settings of which make it look like they're playing as if without cheats. Maybe, using walls, but playing as if they weren't. This can easily bypass VAC, and leave it to Overwatch to predict  their fate, but the majority are very good at hiding such a thing, making Overwatch, a joke like VAC. The thing being, with these cheats, is that they're so well known, and easy to gain access to for a small sum of cash. Commonly cheap, as well. This is an issue ValvE is doing nothing about. The race against cheaters will never end, as programmers and modders will always be out there finding ways to gain the advantage in online games. Cheating, is something that can never end, as it will always be possible, even if it were to be completely illegal to use said cheats. ValvE is implementing a system of which their 'bots' will have a further-developed cheat detecting AI, which learns from cheaters how they operate, and move, and detect inhuman moves, that could not be done. They've currentely got Version 1 of these bots released in CS, of which only detect spinbotters, which is good progress as the processing power required for such a thing, is a large demand. The thing that can go wrong with this; are the shots some people hit, mainly deemed as 'lucky' could be detected as 'inhuman' and therefore, that player being banned. I think the bots submit the player to Overwatch though, which invalidates my point.  ValvE are doing something against the issues with CS, but not as much as they could be doing.  Don't get me wrong though, this game is a wonderful game, if I'm quite honest, as it truly offers actual thinking as you progress through the ranks, and offers a sense of achievement within the ranking system when you rank up - the community on the other hand, being no better. I do believe the EU servers are insanely screwed, due to such a mixture of different countries, and languages to be dealt with, and it being an issue, on a team, creating strategies, with 4 randoms, of which are usually from Turkey, or Russia, and mic spam the entire time, offering no support just an entire game giving you a headache.  This once was a great game, and in sense, it still is. It was only ever ruined by the community, in my opinion.			"

												When I reviewed Counter-Strike Source a few years ago, I called it things like ""immortal"" and ""the definitive multiplayer FPS.""The Awp is easily one of the most satisfying weapons in gaming. Quickscoping and noscoping can be a gamble - I really like the balance and precise feel of the Awp.  The rest of the weapons feel really good - there is much more variety here: we are talking custom weapon skins and even a custom loadout for each team.  This is one of the areas where CS:GO shines, and leaves its predecessors in the dark ages.Competitive matchmaking is one of the really nice features of Global Offensive.  The game allows you to play in competitive matches based on your skill level rating. This is done similar to the matchmaking in Dota 2.  While not perfect, I find the matchmaking to be pretty accurate - it is rarely a cakewalk.Always be wary of the player community for this game - this community has some sick and twisted people, tons of trolls, smack talkers, hack accusers, mic spammers, and cry babies, lol.  Fortunately you can mute players, and if you are so inclined, can vote them off the game - nice!Trading and items drops are a fairly big part of the game as well. One of the neat things about the game is you can easily sell back your in game drops via Steam market and basically play this game for free or even profit from it. its insane, but some items sell for over $400 USD.CS:GO is on the rise reaching peaks near 300,000 players.  There are huge tournaments played, and with each passing month the game sees positive growth.  I think its safe to say this is the new ""definitive multiplayer FPS""!9/10			"

												Pros-Cheap-No pay 2 win-Fun to play with Friends-You get drops,so you will most likely get your spent steam wallet money back-Easy to find an online match-if you are from Europe,then you will master Russian language after playing this game-Many community servers options-A wonderful Esports SceneCons-This game is like cocaine,You will get addicted very soon(not even kidding)-if you play solo,Then you will get morons 99.9999% of the time-you will find People who Thinks csgo rank is more important than Life-This game is filled with cheaters(unplayable at high ranks),Trollers(At low ranks),Smurfs(At average ranks,you will see atleast 1 per game)-Unbalanced Maps(Ex: Nuke)-Unbalanced Pistols ( At close range/Medium range A 3100$ Rifle headshot does 89 damage,But a 500$ pistol does insta death)-if you are a kid/ morons You will use your moms credit card to buy skins or for gambling-Valve doesnt give a fc uk about this game,There are still the same bugs even after 4 years(ex: Valve DM).They take ages to fix even small bugs-No Fun modes,This is a Really Really Really serious game-No unranked matchmaking-Valve Releases updates to Reduce your game fps instead of reducing bugs-Prime matchmaking -Toxic community1.What is prime matchmakingyou need to reach level 21 in the game(takes atleast a month if you play daily)and must have steam guards(To link your mobile with csgo account) to play prime matchmakingPrime matchmaking guys will partner/face prime matchmaking guys(so this reduces cheaters/smurfs)So new players have to play with cheaters/smurfs/morons untill they reach level 21 which is BSTL;DR : if u have four other friends,this game is for you             if u want to play solo,then you will just be wasting your time             Valve anticheat is really bad,so unplayable at higher ranks           Trollers(At low ranks),Smurfs(At average ranks,you will see atleast 1 per game)Bonus Tip: Dont do case openings(You will get BS skin 95%) and dont buy skins with real money(dont be stupid)			"

												Nice graphics, new maps, weapons and models. But developers should listen to the customers a bit more. Developers you are focused too much on things that are not important at all. You should focus on changing the tick rate of the match making servers to 128 and improving VAC a lot. Those two are what customers really want and you should focus on. Not stickers, UI and HUD changes or skins. And stop messing around with the weapons.			"

												The CS:GO community is full of immature, edgy teenagers and college kids who still think homophobic and racist slurs are the epitome of wit. Unless you find a server with a well-adjusted group of admin, be ready to be critiqued regularly, insulted for every kill, and harassed if you even think about just playing to have fun instead of to win. Don't use the weapon of someone else's choice? Then you're a moron. If you're as lucky as I've been, and find comrades who just want to play without trash talk and accusations of cheating at the slightest hint of success, you can actually eke out some enjoyment from the game. Most public servers are pure-grade garbage though. Sadly, trying to complete one of the new missions they've implemented means sometimes having to tolerate listening to non-stop tantrums by some twelve year old whose voice hasn't even cracked yet.And every time you decide you've had enough, Valve releases another patch with new gun skins because that's what draws people back in, and you realize that you can actually make money by just playing the game and selling the♥♥♥♥♥♥you receive for free just for playing. Oh look, a new skin case just came out. Prices for it are going to be high at first, better play some CS:GO, get some case drops and sell them so I can buy a game that doesn't make me want to shoot myself when I listen to the other people playing it.amended 07/29/14: Guess what? Sending me offensive comments and hate mail only serves to prove my point as to the maturity level of your average CS:GO player, it doesn't hurt my feelings, but it does get you reported. By all means, keep it up!			"

												Really good game. Very simple, yet complex at the same time. For first time players: DO NOT let the game's recoil mechanics scare you away. It will take some time to get used to but once you do, it is a great game.PROS: [+]-Great community (COMPARED TO SOME OTHER GAMES)-Frequent updates-Tradable stuff-Source Engine means that players from GMod, CS 1.6/Source, etc. won't (or at least shouldn't) have a hard time adapting to new controls and physics.-VERY Competitive at higher levels-Tons of workshop files and tons of room to make your own skins and maps-Weapon skins -Multiple modes for casual or competitive and more-High FPS on almost any PC (great optimization)CONS: [-]-Skins can be expensive or worthless-Skins and cases can suck the money out of you if you let it-Recoil is not very easy to get used to-No aiming down sights (FOR NEW PEOPLE, CALM DOWN VETS)-Cooldowns can be handed out unfairly-Low graphic quality/detail compared to other games (IT IS SOURCE, CALM DOWN)-MP only (if you are reading this, you most likely have internet at home, THERE IS A BOTS ONLY OPTION)-Hackers do like to hack in competitive matches at higher levels-Callouts are not that easy to learn for beginnersOVERALL:Get it. If it is on sale, CS:GO is an even better deal. The recoil was my biggest challenge at the start but just take some time to practice with bots. Perfect for traders, casual FPS players, competitive FPS players, and workshop content creators.RATING:9.5/10			"

												Apart from being primarily a game, made for entertainment and competitive purposes, CS:GO is also a powerful personal development tool. Aside from (arguably) improving reaction times and hand-eye coordination, it teaches valuable life lessons, including the following: - It teaches you not to pay attention to other people's insults opinions. ""Dude, you are so bad that last night your mom told me you were a mistake."" - It teaches to keep your cool in high stress situations, when you have such an adrenaline rush that it seems to be leaking through your pores. - It improves your judgment, decision-making and learning process, because the game gives you immediate feedback for any of your actions or inactions. ""Welp, shouldn't have peeked against that guy in the middle.""- It teaches you to take responsibility. In most game situations, you can only blame yourself when things go wrong.- It teaches you to enjoy the game, even if you aren't winning. You can't win in life, you can only ease suffering and have a good time once in a while.Of course, as you could probably notice when interacting with your fellow community members, none of this will happen on its own--unless one pays conscious attention to the situations in the game and the feelings they elicit.

												This game has a feature were you can turn $2.50 into 10₵!Then you bet that 10₵ skin you just got on CSGO lounge to try and make your money back, but then lose the bet.Outraged you decide to buy another key, hoping that this will make up your money by pulling a knife, only to find that you got another 10₵ skin.Hundreds of dollars later, finally you think you have learnt your lesson, to not buy keys and decide to buy a skin straight off the market for full price.Being still resonably new to the game, you click the unknown link, unaware of what is going on, you later realise that you have been scammed. Thats right that skin you bought, more expensive then the game, and all 10₵ skins you have purchased for $2.50 are gone.Outraged once again, you start this process all over, this time knowing the chances of you pulling a knife and making your money back are extremely, slim, but you feel that this will be the one, lol nope get rekt son, 69₵ skin.

Many of the things that distinguish GO from the other games in the CS series are its worst features. The player speed, acceleration and accuracy values, plus hardly any tagging (player slowing when shot) caused the adad technique where the player strafes one way then changes direction giving him a second of accuracy where he takes some shots. What this, plus horribly broken cilent-server hitbox sync translates to ingame is spamming the strafe keys and hoping to land a shot. All this gives us a CS that values frags over brains.

												I bought cs:go for the storyline and the mmo feeling i haven't had since World of Warcraft.A few people ask me how the hell i speak russian and what is the fastest way to learn it.The answer is obivious... CS:GO!This is the game where you can enjoy all of your fetishes including tea-bagging,flaming noobs,being noob,singin with your mentally disabled polish friends,planting bombs with arabian guys and the best of all .... CHICKENS!!!!Of course there are chickens even on the nucler plant, planty of chickens.Ohh and the best in the game the totally fair matchmaking system that helps you find the best russian mates only on dust2 just for you in your skillgroup.Sometimes you even find players with mental skills over a 5 year old baby.Ohh and you can meet traders (Jews of steam) and scammers (Gypsies of steam) they are always the most trustable people you can ever meet on this globe so far.Every minute you invest into this amazing game enchance your not existing skill and accuary to make you one of the worst silver that universe ever seen.I wish good luck for this really great game i can only recommend it for others for such a lot of great reasons ^^ .

My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 21, I have never touched a cigarette.

												This newest iteration of the series that single-handedly sparked global interest in competitive gaming leaves little to be desired. While its beginnings were bumpy, the developers have listened to the community and are still listening, regularly making the game more enjoyable and beginner/spectator-friendly while still maintaining the integrity of the competitiveness of the game. I have high hopes that Counter Strike will be seeing a comeback in popularity. If you enjoy competitive gameplay and bettering yourself against greater opponents, you should have no doubts when choosing to buy this game. It took me over 500 hours of gameplay to get to a skill level that I feel content with (I am currently the second-highest matchmaking rank). Thanks to Global Offensive's ranking system, even a lone player can have satisfying matches in the matchmaking system and grow in skill on their own. Yes, the occasional blips happen where you're put with unreliable teammates or put against unreal opponents, but these are only opportunities to better yourself and learn what you can do as a player to increase your odds.When you do decide to buy Counter Strike: Global Offensive, I encourage you to put your all into learning about the game and bettering yourself. Research what you can do to train your aim, what you can do to train your recoil control, and watch pro players to learn about game sense. For a game in which you often times find yourself waging the same battles at the same chokepoints, it is remarkable how every battle can be just as tense as the first one you ever participated in.TL;DR: THE SKILL CAP TO THIS GAME IS RIDICULOUS, IF YOU LIKE COMPETITION YOU SHOULD PICK IT UP!

Learn to use it.5) The guns have rubber barrels so when you hold the trigger for more than 3 shots, the bullets will go all over the screen.6) P90 was crafted by Gods so it's users are not hackers.7) If you have the bomb, sit behind your team like a good dog.8) The game's secret name is Counter-Strike: Dust 2.9) Competitive is the main game mode but there are other modes for your little kids too!10) If you easily get brain cancer just from losing one match STAY AWAY FROM COMPETITIVE! you psycho!P.S.

												Counter-Strike needs no introduction. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive on the other hand.... you don't know where to begin nor where to end talking about it.CSGO is the 4th installment in the Counter-Strike franchise. It was released 8 years after CS:S.(I personally did not know how the game felt or played because I didn't get it until 2014, but after that to this date, I have my opinion formed and it is time to review this b i t c h). The game has changed from 2012-2014 period. Even tho I haven't played it for those 1 and a half year, I have seen plenty of videos, watched tournaments etc... THROUGHOUT THE YEARS  From 2014-2016 the game has changed a lot, some for better, a lot for worse. From updates like Skin cases, Operations, new guns, a map or two here and there, hitboxes and whatnot...   2014 and 2015 were somewhat good years for CSGO, but then the ""beloved"" 2016 came on knocking hard.. CSGO Dev team managed to ruin all the progress they made over the past 3 and  a half years with each update the released in 2016.   1 Operation that was released 11 months ago, Beta testing for Infernew and Lobbies are the ONLY good things VALVᴱ and the CSGO Dev team did RIGHT in 12 months. But were are here to talk about the wrong. So lets dig in.  With each update there was a game breaking issue, they roll out the update, the community goes nuts, finds everything wrong, they cry about it, they scream about it and we have to play the waiting game for VALVᴱ to roll out another update to fix their mistake. Sometimes within few hours (rarely happens), sometimes within a day or two. Thing is.... they CAN beta test their updates before they release them, but they don't. Only 1 time (that I have personally witnessed) that happened and it was with the release with reworked Inferno. Not to mention the lack of communication with the community and let them know WHEN and HOW LONG the official servers would be down due to the updates... ending up with players being disconnected thus ""earning"" themselves a ban up to 7 days. We got a ridiculous amount of stupid updates such as:- a lot of unnecessary skin cases,- GLOVES (lets not talk about it) - SPRAYS (50 left and you can only buy them at the community market OR get them as drops on official severs of any game mode), - Redesigned SAS Model, - music kits, - only ONE operation in 2016, - changed all of the gun sounds which are ridiculously stupid and unnecessary (its more of a taste I suppose but that doesn't change the fact that was stupid and unnecessary),  - HRTF... True, all of the things that are for purchase such as skins, knives, gloves, sprays are optional and ARE NOT game changing nor game breaking BUT the fact that VALVᴱ is forcing it and majorly focusing on skins and other stupid stuff rather then fixing the god damn game, IS WRONG! VACCheaters are having the time of their life with this game. What happens with VAC is, every 2 months you get a HUGE ban wave with 1000 accounts banned. Every 2 Months.... It's just sad. The cheating in CSGO will never go away for 1 main reason and that reason is....VALVᴱ makes money. Ban cheaters, let them purchase the game, and so on and so on and so on. That cycle keeps repeating itself, over and over.  CSGO COMMUNITYTOXIC VALVᴱ, the future of CSGO and future games of VALVᴱVALVᴱ is a multi billionaire company with around 360 employees in 2016. [Source:Wikipedia]To this date, they do not communicate with the community. That is a major issue. They should really learn a thing or two from Riot and Blizzard on communication.January 1st 2017, for at least 22 hours, if not more, the game was offline. You could not play on any official csgo server on all of their game modes. To this day we have no idea what happened, we had no idea when it was gonna be fixed, nothing. Once again it was the waiting game, like always.   CSGO is gonna die sooner than later, and that is a sad truth. Everyone is sick of the same 7 maps, playing against cheaters, with broken hit boxes, jump scouts, over powered pistols (nerf them all already), lack of operations, optimize the game (because whats stated in the spec on the store page is not correct unless you want to play with 20 fps), etc...  There are many many things that need fixing but what we all know so far is that VALVᴱ is a money grabbing company and gives 0 ♥♥♥♥s about the state of their games. FACT!IF ONE PERSON (ZOOL),SINGLE-HANDEDLY  CAN MAKE A MOD FOR CSGO (Counter-Strike: Classic Offensive), STILL BE IN BETA AND IT IS BETTER THAN YOUR OWN GAME VALVᴱ, YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING WRONGAs for the future games that VALVᴱ will release, such as Half Life 3 and Left 4 Dead 3.... I wouldn't be surprised if we see skins and other purchasable bull s h i t and all the focus goes there...  DO NOT waste money and give them to VALVᴱ. Skins are pointless and overpriced (the good ones of course), and there is absolutely 0 reasons for having a skin.  I DO NOT recommend this game UNLESS it is 50% or more on discount and you play with your friends. If you want to play on random servers such as surf, kz, zm/ze and what have you, there is always another way around it ;)			"

												Counter strike is a lovely game with a lovely community, its a perfect place for a malignant narcissist to flourish. If you love friendly interactions from all sorts of Ethnicities then this is your game.Pros1. You can slowly get the money you paid for the game back with 1p drops in game2. If your rich you can show all the peasants how cool your knives look and make all the Russian children trade in their grain stores to buy a sand dune nova.3. Kill Terrorist ( big thumbs up from American players)4. A deep and engrossing story line and ranking system with so much context into the terrorists motivations.Cons1.Terrorists are evil and no one tells me why, the game should be more politically correct or call them freedom, fighters.2. Game is old and I cant kill ISIS, may change in the future if valve wants to make this game an immersive experience. 3. Lots of children with horrible voices that make you want to use a cheese grater on your skull.4. If you have friends you wont have them long as you will rage every time they let you die leading to you pouring piping hot tea on your sisters face. 5. All developed nations decide to allow their troops to go to battle without body Armour making them spend their salary on equipment - 40000 immersion points.6. If you are British there is a whole wealth of opportunities to hear constant slaughtering of your language and a barrage of Tea hate which will be most disturbing. In conclusion this Game is Fantastic with its revolutionary graphics, sweet jumpers for some terrorist and a real look into counter terrorism operations.			"

												The most toxic gaming community you could ever come across. Full of rage hacking kids who are toxic as hell and need a leather belt whipped on their bare♥♥♥♥♥more than a few times. Spend hours aim practising and smoke maps etc to bust your♥♥♥♥♥out of gold nova to finally make it to MG. Turns out anyone and everyone who is in MG and plays like a god is apparently an smfc smurf, and ""clearly not a hacker"" The amount of smfc there is in Australia is outstanding, but yet still manage to come up with a♥♥♥♥♥♥team like the renegades. Prime is ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous, you have more luck queueing non prime to get legit players. Incredibly hard being a girl gamer, use your mic and you're going to get roasted by 12ies who have mummy issues and most probably virgins and also that you have a voice changer because clearly females never leave the kitchen and wouldnt be half decent at ""a man's game"". Don't use your mic to avoid said situation and get accused of being broke and not being able to afford a mic. After nearly a year of playing this and watching the game turn to♥♥♥♥♥♥as all they care about is adding new skins every ♥♥♥♥ing month and not giving two ♥♥♥♥♥ about their anti hack, I shudder to think where it'll be in a few months, and ive only been playing a year -.-GGWP Gaben you freaking tool.

												Years of playing overrated AAA shooting games with lens flares, blood on the corners of your vision, and blue everything have since taken me away from the good old primative day of filling in the shoes of generic swat teams fighting generic terrorists; of which both groups lack the ability to look down the sights of all but a few weapons. Then I found Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Being set eight years after the events of the previous game, there are noticeable changes brought upon by the passage of time. For example, the cognitive ability of hostages have further decreased to the point where they can't walk on their own. Moreover, both the terrorists and counter-terrorists adpoted new-found language ability. Finally, as we've evolved from the black and white days to being able to see the world in color, the world of Source has evolved drasticly in it's graphics in the eight-year gap between games.Among the new things introduced are atom-wide ledges, birds of superavian strength, and a modernized Russian train station which pays tribute to the skillful, fun to play with, and polite players of the Motherland.Finally, Counter Strike: Global Offensive has gone above and beyond the expectations of being an emergant AAA title by introducing an economy system that teaches rich naive kids the harshness of the post-2008 economy. Bravo.I've only played a bit of it but I will reward this game with a 9/10 for it's advanced chicken AI and the hyper-realistic sounds they make when you caress them with knifes in a fashion akin to spreading butter.

												UI is broken on 21:9 aspect ratio monitors and worst thing is they do not care about this. I even emailed them about this issue, but not a single response. However they are fixing the things which aren't broken, like sounds. Thx to new updates now guns sound like a plastic toys. They totally ruined it. And now they even added Graffiti. Something that used to be free now costs money, and for a limited amount. Seriously?! Who cares about these things? No one even asked about them. Valve isn't listening to people, doesn't fix technical problems and their every update ruins the game. Ranking system is also stupid, because you level up and level down depending on your team's win and loses, not on your kills/deaths ratios. This means you can be carried easily with your team. This game could be better if they could fix those things, but they don't care and their game is sh*t.			"

												Valve is trying to kill this franchise. Each patch gets increasingly more ridiculous. Devs don't play the game, they don't care about the game. Or maybe they play only Arms Races with bots on big picture with steam controllers. Hard to tell. Anyway, CS:GO is to cs 1.6 what Diablo 3 is to Diablo 2. A bland, casual cash crop. Don't believe it?

												Okay.  This is a tough one, yet simple.  The game by itself is somewhat great.  7/10.  Some of the game mechanics make no sense.  I'll place the crosshair right on someone's head and it completely misses.  Don't get that.  Other than that very, very annoying bug, this game is great.  CS:GO is a game of tactics and skill.  Not in any way close to COD or BF.Pros:-Very balanced.  The concept of buying is that you earn money from killing, setting off/defusing bombs, and by simply existing.  At the start of each round, you buy guns, grenades, and utilities.  Most all weapons are balanced in the right hands.-The game takes skill.  A 5-year-old cannot play this game and win (unlike COD).  It takes tactical planning and team organization to win.  -Frequent updates.  Explains itself.  Updates range from new skins to new maps.Cons: -90% of the community is extremely salty and angry.  These people treat everyone like complete jerks.  Makes the game quite unenjoyable.-The skin market is a literal pyramid scheme.  While it's not always like this, it can be pretty evident at times.  In my humble opinion, skins are a complete waste of money unless you are a literal pro playing at DreamHack, ESL, or some other major ESporting event.Conclusion:The community has pushed me to hate this game.  While the game by itself is okay, the majority of the community ruins it.  The worst part is, there is no fix for this that I know of.  I would neither recommend or go whining about this game.			"

												Best competetive ""guess where hitbox is"", ""99 in 16 hits"" and crate opening simulator for true MLG players. You have beautiful classic 10x10 metres square maps to test your tactical genius, truely realistic feeling of shooting with airsoft weapons with stunning purple camo and banana stickers on them.   Will i eco or will i buy after lost pistol round? It doesn't matter because at ""master guardian elite"" level and below your teammates will buy and die anyway and there's nothing you can do about it, since they're speaking on horrific Lovecraftian languages. Good thing skill levels make a difference and ELO works in team games, right? You just have to reach Global Elite or train your real life friends in special camps for 5 years to have competent teams and enjoyable rounds.  You can play on Dust 2, Mirage or Cache, because search for other maps takes forever, which is good because these  legitimate tournament maps don't reward people for ""suka krisa"" gameplay.  Weapon spray act just like it should: it works in preprogrammed pattern so you must remember spray of every weapon if you want to kill♥♥♥♥♥♥ because if you just sit with ak and shot static target right in the head, you might actually miss! It aint 1.6 anymore, scrub! It works kinda like japaneze Touhou games: you play for 100 hours to remember every pattern and then you're good to go to play on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ competetive servers where hitboxes travel in outer space and none of it actually matters.  Anti-cheat system works like a charm! People can just buy csgo gift for 1 dollar at some web service, other guys can exchange it for a crate that drops every now and then, play 10 games with wh and aim and get up to ""distinguished master guardian"" just in 4 hours or less. Then you will be delighted to play against them as they rush middle at dust 2 making 5 headshots as fast as rmb can be pressed. But no worries! Since VAC doesn't work properly, developers added Community Overwatch where you can spent up to 10 minutes looking at some guy running at light speeds with negev spinning like a yoyo killing everything! Without even slightest reward or weapon skins you like so much you can do developers' job at cleaning off the cheaters!  As for the graphics, since Source they added motion blur.			"

This game if far beyond awesome than most FPS which u pay around 60 euros for or more.You play matches with people in your own skill rank and u rank up when you get better.You dont have to worry to get in the game and be shooted by people that are 50 ranks higher than you.the game runs smooth, looks really good and you can play deathmatch against bots and other people, or competitively & Alone.Its highly addictive and for the price it is right now definitely worth trying.

												Played 950+ hours. Played after a very long break from May, and grinded up to LEM-Supreme level until August. Now, I've had enough. The game is not developing, only getting worse and worse. Weekly ""updates"" which are making the game even less competitive, screwed-up hitboxes (even on 128 tick servers), and a♥♥♥♥♥♥tons of cheaters. Valve does not do anything about it, they only care about money (which is why they are making new cases), they don't give a crap about the players. Cheaters everywhere, ♥♥♥♥ed up hitboxes. Really liked this game, even had a semi-pro team (which was improving FASTER then CSGO itself). I'd like to say that cheaters only play in competitive games, but I would be lying. I was playing with my friend who just started a game, and does not have rank, so we could play casual games only. The enemy team thought I was cheating (even though I have 20+ screenshots on my profile with my rank), so one turned his/her hacks on, and... you know the rest. Don't buy this game, only if you want to tilt your♥♥♥♥♥off.			"

												As I am not a friend from quickly looking at a game then glorify or damn it, I decided to write a review after playing more than 1000 hours. If you like skilled games and train hard to become better, this game is one you stick along time with it. After hundreds of hours, you still find ways to play it, places to hide, tactics to use etc. So this game greatly combines skill with tactics and teamplay and from this  I would highly recommend it. I also like the point, that you can obtain skins for your favorite weapons but to pay more for coloured pixels than for a real gun or knife is pervy. BUT the longer I play this game there are things that really suck with this game. A bunch of friends starting with me to play this game do not any more cause of some very bad issues. With more hours and over 280 competitives won, one should think to have become a better player than with 100 or 200 hours of gameplay. But fact is since the change of ELO system, which since seem to adapt to a balance of the ranks I (and a lot of my friends) did not manage to get a better rank than GNM, thus beeing MG2 before. This means in my case I am still an average player, who did not gain any progression in game skill. This I would have to accept. BUT if I do competitive MM in a full team, where no one is smurfing we have the chance of 50/50 to play against enemies who do have one or more players, which are far better than the best player in my team. So often they confess to be smurfs (People playing with a second account on a level much lower, than their main accounts), or they might be hacking or they are high level players boosting up new accounts for selling them later. So this is the reason that average players have no change going to higher levels. Valve might have recognized this issue since they intend a premium membership of accounts which are confirmed by smartphone (so it would be expensive für smurfs or boosters to have a lot of different smartphone SIM cards). In Casual Gaming people advertize that they use hacks, advertize for hacking websites e.g. a i m w a r e . n e t,  e z f r a g s . c o . u k etc. I did report them and looked into their steam profiles weeks after that but they never get VAC banned after weeks. Steam and VAC does not seem to much effort in VAC banning these people and getting these websites removed. There is also one thing that could be improved: Steam should provide servers with a tickrate of 128 for competitive MM. Steam is earning a lot of money from people ""paying to shine"" for weapon skins or knifes, so money should not be the issue. I still will play this game for some time, but considering the game fun and nearly lack of progression for average players I do not recommend this games to start with it.			"

												My brother is an ""avid amateur chess player"". That's how he describes himself when making small talk.You should see his room. It's full of dumb chess pieces from different sets, like his favorite Gold Pawn. It's not really gold but he claims it is. (Nobody believes him)So anyway, one time I went to his room and I saw new addition to his collection. It was a giant paper mache bishop. Like, 3 feet tall. He obviously made it himself because it was crooked and I saw yesterday's news on the Bishop's belly.But what really attracted me to the giant bishop was its unproportionally small head. The whole thing was like a freaky baby milk bottle.So approached the artifact, and I bit the tip off. Unfortunately for me, my brother saw me do it.Unfortunately for him, I move as quick as a fox.I was a dancing blur of after image, avoiding every attack he tried to throw at me. I slipped past him and dashed straight to the safety of my dad's room. I locked myself in until the angry beast outside calmed down.Then I asked myself, ""Self, what do I do now?"".So I booted my dad's PC, which I also use for gaming, logged into Steam and saw that CS:GO was on sale.I bought it. It is an ok game. "

												After playing for nearly 2000 hours, you'd expect I'd be pretty good at this game, but I'm actually bloody awful. A good percentage of the community is too toxic for you to even enjoy playing - and if you get toxic teammates then you've almost definitely lost the game and will probably derank to be surrounded by people who are even more toxic and even less competent.So why recommend it? It's the best of a worst situation type thing, you see, every game the industry has dropped on us recently has been a down right disappointment so instead of dealing with those games just buy skins. Skins are literally the only reason to play this game :^)Sometimes the game is fun but that's usually because some ruskis are shouting at eachother instead of shouting at you and you just sit there like ""hue♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ idi nahui silly ruskis :))""			"

												Do you want a fast-paced multiplayer FPS that is riddled with inconsistent crap netcode that readily bends over a barrel and presents a jasmine scented♥♥♥♥♥♥which pooches open in anticipation for every two-bit ""hacker"" on the Internet? Well then THIS IS FOR YOU!Do you enjoy an endless torrent of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t hackers? Teamkillers? Smurfs? Gobshites with broken microphones who will readily spout an everlasting supply of foreign swear words while you're trying to listen for the enemy? That's right, nothing adds to the challenge more than having to watch out for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and traitors on your own team!Laggy no-skill morons from far-flung lands who are impossible to hit? That's right, hit your router with a hammer and fill the ports with kitkat wrappers because YOUR HALF SECOND PING WILL SAVE YOU SON! That's called LAG COMPENSATION which gives ALMOST TOTAL INVINCIBILITY to anyone with an Internet connection that has no business whatsoever playing games like this.This was once a good game. These days KDR stands for ""Kids, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and Russians"". Toxicity from top to bottom. ""But surely, at the higher levels, you get away from all that!"" Yeah, check out the regular reports of ""pro"" players throwing matches for money, using hacks at top-tier tournament level, and acting like 12-year olds. Banwaves are good for about a day, if that, just to give you a glimpse of what the game could be. Don't even waste your time reporting griefers and hackers, if you want to do something more useful, open notepad, type some Russian swear words (you will know them all by now) then save the document and throw it into your Recycle Bin.Avoid at all cost. Play a man's game. Let the children have this one and buy ArmA 3 instead. Find a good, well adminned server. Ping greater than 300? *BOOM* See ya, Vlad. Mouthy teenager? *BOOM* See ya, Timmy.COMING SOON: Yet another half-baked cack-handed attempt at balancing the pistols ...			"

												I can describe CsGo and the CsGo community in one word...Aids. Counterstrike is a fun fast strategic shooter that has been around for years. But slowly as the cod and console community moves over to pc they bring there negative and ♥♥♥♥♥y attitudes. I myself is an offender of this. But I have time on my hand to write this review because i was just in a competative match and got a 24 hour ban... We were kicking the other teams♥♥♥♥♥and the good o'l sqeuakers that were on my team decided to throw the game away at 6-12 us, so for the next 9 rounds my team took an♥♥♥♥♥pounding. This would've been my rank up game and i would be one step closer to be the best, that no one ever was. ""but wait...Two Girls One Awp...you can still rank up if you loose."" Well thats the funny thing. These little quickscoping killstreak wanting peices of♥♥♥♥♥♥wanted to prolong my climb to the top and thought it would be funny to ♥♥♥♥ing kick me. So now im sitting here writing this ♥♥♥♥ing review that no one but my friends will ♥♥♥♥ing see. But, I digress if you like learning to play a game dont buy this game because i swear to you the moment you get in the game some we call you a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥cunt who is legit ♥♥♥♥ing trash and should kill yourself while butt ♥♥♥♥ing your dad...that is what you experience. If you somehow can get good at this game then maybe you will find a nice group of lads that can work well with you. But you will most likley be called a♥♥♥♥♥♥sniffing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who should go back to cod because you are a ♥♥♥♥♥♥. This game will ruin friendships turn you into a monster. will i still play? ya but not in the next 24 ♥♥♥♥ing hours because the ban system is the most broken thing on the ♥♥♥♥ing planet.  But now you know what the core gameplay is like lets talk about the skins. Oh the skins. Beautiful skins. Marble fade karambit, dragon lore, vulcan, and all the cool knifes. wait. $1000 DOLLARS. are you ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me i could buy a new graphics card and a prossecer♥♥♥♥♥♥a new ♥♥♥♥ing car. Yes every good looking skin in this game is made for two types of people youtubers that are so rich they can start a bank and the little kid that steals his mommys purse. Oh and dont even think about trading your skins outside of steam because everyone and their mothers is a scammer. And i have one more thing to say about this game. about 30% of the community is female and thats a lot because 6 million plus people play cs go on a regular bases. But how much of that 30% are not egirls looking to use there body to use you about 10% most girls you will meet on cs go are the ♥♥♥♥♥iest chicks on the planet who join the game and are like ""hey guys Im a guuurl""♥♥♥♥♥♥they may asswell come in and say, ""Give me skins because i have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ you will never see""               So to some it up better invest in a therepist after this game becasue you will need one                                                                    10 outa 10			"

												That type of game which could relate to sweet old times of 90s when games were both challenging and simple enough to offer thousands of hours of gametime and still not being completely satiated. CSGO puts the CS title back on top of the competetive games and is a rightful king with undefeated throne for a long, long time.The skillcap of this game ranges from a total casual player to a hardcore pro and cannot be described be words how many factors differentiate a pro from a noob.This is the true and only FPS online game to play in 2014 onwards.

About This Game	Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO) will expand upon the team-based action gameplay that it pioneered when it was launched 14 years ago.CS: GO features new maps, characters, and weapons and delivers updated versions of the classic CS content (de_dust, etc.). In addition, CS: GO will introduce new gameplay modes, matchmaking, leader boards, and more.""Counter-Strike took the gaming industry by surprise when the unlikely MOD became the most played online PC action game in the world almost immediately after its release in August 1999,"" said Doug Lombardi at Valve. ""For the past 12 years, it has continued to be one of the most-played games in the world, headline competitive gaming tournaments and selling over 25 million units worldwide across the franchise. CS: GO promises to expand on CS' award-winning gameplay and deliver it to gamers on the PC as well as the next gen consoles and the Mac.""Gameplay		The competitive game mode is the main grasp of the game for me. It features close to endless enjoyment and always offers a different experience each time. The game is heavily skill based, and will require some time and effort to get better. There is plenty of guns, all with different recoil patterns. There are many maps in the game, and new ones are added during operations. There are also community maps you can play with friends as well. The other gamemodes to competitive are more casual gamemodes, but are usually not as enjoyable, due to the lack of skill groups meaning you will end up against better or worse opponents to yourself. Graphics	Graphics are not the main aim of CS:GO. They are nothing special, but are definately improved over previous games. The game is decently optimised, and can run on many machines, even old ones!All in All Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a really nice Game!10/10 From Me Sweep  "

												An intense, story-driven game written by the community, brought down by glaring flaws. The plot revolves around a bunch of screaming manchildren locked into a constant battle for guns with paintjobs. Hack wars commence, scams are carried out, and viruses are created in an attempt to gain any leverage possible. As one of the many players of this war, you must choose your allegiances properly. Will you simply be another ""casual"" and be called every name in the book by others for poor performance, race, sex, etc? Will you become one of the elitists and make money off of the guns? Or will you maliciously assault your fellow comardes and enemies alike with verbal harassment?Unfortunately, your character is outnumbered and outgunned. He must be a hyperactive drug addict, as he can run around at speeds that would make a Ferrari blush with near-instant acceleration but cannot shoot straight to save his life. He can shoot the first two shots accurately with some degree of randomness, but past that he starts flaiiing his arms around and begins shooting the sky in a vain effort to kill God rather than the other humans shooting back at him. Fortunately, your enemies are usually as incompetent as you are, so most battles turn into a spamfest of bullets as both sides scream racial slurs at each other and hope their bullet hits the other guy. Of course, a lot of times, much higher-skilled players posing as low-tier enemies will go up against you to fulfill their own malicious power fantasies. These people are called ""smurfs"". They function as boss fights and usually hurl taunts and insults your direction. Beat them to see them break down villainously and accuse you of hacking.Of course, there are also hackers. Some are possible to beat, others are not. They have added advantages, such as x-ray vision, computerized aiming, and a jetpack that allows them to hop across maps at blinding speeds. Have fun with that.The soundtrack is poor, as there are very few tracks in the game and most of them last for only several seconds, and you will hear them all within two minutes of playing. Valve does allow the purchase of soundtrack DLC, which only give you different very short tracks for the price of $7. This is a very shameful business practice, and one has to wonder why EA gets fluff for this but not Valve.The graphics are rather ugly with blurry textures that look like they were ported from the original XBOX and lifeless environments. This is said to make the game competitively playable, but everyone knows good video games like Call of Duty all have giant neon signs and lens flares that obscure vision. The optimization is rather poor as well. On my state-of-the-art 2011 laptop loaded with an Intel HD 3000, the finest in graphics card technology, it gets a pitiful 25 FPS in menus with performance usually worse in-game. This leads to frustrating deaths as I see my enemies teleport around and shoot me in the face, or I suddenly freeze in place and again get shot in the face, in which they will usually taunt me with expletives. This is absolutely unforgivable for a game released this decade. My computer can run Crysis.The loot system in this game, however, has much potential. The guns you can get nearly rival Borderlands The Pre-Sequel in originality, design, and neon colors. However, unlike Borderlands The Pre-Sequel, the guns cost real money on either the outside-game service Steam Community Market or by opening cases, which cost $2.49 per attempt and usually only yield Common-grade loot. This is disgraceful and exploitative of the consumer base. Gearbox clearly has it right, as unlike Valve, they never release overpriced DLC for their Borderlands series. As Valve have shown they cannot design games, they should hand off Half-Life 3 to Gearbox Software instead.Overall, this game is outdated, treats customers like crap, has little content, unintiuitive gameplay, a terrible community, bad level design, and more. Stay away and buy Call of Duty Modern Warfare 17 instead.69/420			"

												If you want to play a game filled with smurfs, hackers, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and kids to young to leagally own the game then this is the game for you! I shall divide it up in those categories and leave any other subjects to the end.Also fair wanring; english is not my first language, spelling errors are expected. Smurfs:Enjoy sitting trough a 30-40 minutes of getting pwnd'ed. Theese guys just figured that its getting to tough and serious playing their own rank and want a relaxing game. the end result is that you will have a not so fun game where a smurf, or even a team of smurf is gonna basically show your head down the toilet. You can expect the same acompaniying trashtalk.Hackers:Well, more or less the same as the smurfs, but any element of fun is gone from the game. depending on what level of hacking its all the more infureating. Spinbotters are ok, they will at least make the game very quick. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s:Theese come in many forms, but usually its the one teamate on your team who thinks he is kennyS and will not shut up so you can try to listen to footsteps, but totally knows without info that they are somewhere else and that you suck. also in this category ate the  two subjects mentioned above and dj's, trolls and the one russian souting GIVE ME AWP and stalks/blocks/shoots you untill he has the desired weapon, and then dies because he hasnt paid any attention.Kids To Young to Legally Own the Game:Theese are just cute to listen to, but share many of the traits of the A-hole subject. They will not shut up, altho they will try their hardest to actually play the game. Tho they have a tendency to scream off your eardrums, ragequit and start to ♥♥♥♥♥alk you, your teammates and the others, but its very entertaining concidering how old they are. Bring popcorn.Other subjects, well, if you are superlucky you might get a fun challening game with people of equal skill. these games will test your reaction and teamwork. what can I say, theese games are just awesome and if you are playing with friends its sooo satesfying. All the different ways to take a bombsite or to get to a hostage, or defend it as the case may be will always be changing. Best to play with a full team of friends.Csgo takes alot of practise, its not a pickupandshoot game. You WILL need to warmup, you will need to learn callouts and the maps and you definitely need to keep a positive attitude.However as csgo is right now, 9/10 games will have a smurf or hacker theese days, and its made csgo horrible to play.To play any rank below LEM is horrible and will hell.Owerall, dont buy the game unless you enjoy being frustrated; its to late for me but save yourself!!! :OEdit 22/04-16A helpful commenter reminded me of Russians. Now I do realize that not all the people we call russians are actual russians, but nowadays its more of a term of ""that"" kind of players... The ones that do not speak a word of english, and then rages as you for not listening to their helpful callouts... that you dont understand... or hear between their nonstop chatter.At any point between the middle and end of the game, they might try to kick you for some reason.Also, to anyone who says ""In order to beat the smurf you have to get better"" or ""its good training"" Yeah, ok sure, but its still not fun to loose constantly. Its not training, its demoralizing.			"

												So I've been playing this game for long enough that it deserves an honest review. After playing a lot of TF2, I bought CS:GO and it was a relatively smooth transition for me due to my TF2 experience. CS:GO easily became my favorite game to play. I originally got ranked at silver 4, and started my climb from there. Over the course of roughly a year, I've made plenty of friends, and learned a lot about the game. I'll separate this into two groups below:The actual game:CS:GO is a game that, for me, bridges the gap between a competitive game and a game I can play all day just to have fun. With CS:GO's matchmaking, it is quite easy to get into a 5v5 competitive game with people of equal skill as you. Matchmaking is a great way to start playing competitive CS:GO, but it is not ideal if you want to improve. If you want to take CS:GO more seriously, you have to use 3rd party services such as FaceIT, CEVO, or ESEA where you will face players that have a higher skill level than in matchmaking(not really FaceIT, FaceIT is the ""entry-level"" service, at least in North America, so it has a lot of newer players). Unfortunately, Valve's matchmaking system is flawed and has smurfs in low ranks and hackers in high ranks, so most people that want to improve or play seriously tend to use 3rd party services.Also, CS:GO has community servers just like any other source game. These community servers run different mods and feature special community-made gamemodes such as KZ, bhop, minigames, retakes, awp only, scoutzknives, and many others. These various gamemeodes supply me with hours of casual fun with my friends when I just feel like relaxing.Trading/skins:Trading has effected CS:GO both positively and negatively. With the addition of weapon skins into the game, CS:GO grew rapidly. CS:GO trading brought a lot of TF2 traders over to CS:GO and started an ingame economy similar to TF2. Also, skin betting on csgolounge was added. Betting skins on professional matches lets you put skins on your favorite teams to cheer them on to victory. The thing is that many people take betting way too seriously(death threats to players, ddosing matches, etc etc). Csgolounge betting has had way more negative impacts on the game than positive in my opinion. I personally try to stay away from trading because it is honestly too stressful for me, and I have no patience.That's all I have to say about CS:GO right now. I would recommend CS:GO to everybody that plays any type of shooter game. A mere $15 has given me nearly 2000 hours of enjoyment, and it will continue to supply more fun for me for a long time. "

												Want a real and honest review? Here you go:Used to be one of the best FPS games out there. At this point the game is so broken and badly maintained. Dev's don't listen to the players and just do things to the game nobody wanted.What players asked: New missions and 128-tick servers. What do we get? We get some nice updates of never wanted gloves with free game breaking addons. Oh how about we give you a nice new sound system nobody wanted just because we can.Let's talk about the VAC system (Valve Anti Cheat):Probally one of the worst working anti cheat systems out there. People can go spinbotting / wallhacking ingame without insta triggering red flags, no they just get a some people in overwatch after 10 reports looking at it. Instead of building a better VAC system to help keep the game fun and fair, they give us gloves and game breaking addons.But I guess if they made the VAC system better half of the pro's out there get insta banned and then it's bye bye CS:GO.  Soon 1.000 hours for me, never had a higher then 0.03€ skin drop, a friend of mine played, gets a 250€ M4A1-S drop with his first deathmatch... It's random but maybe recode it so things like this don't happen because it absolut BS.But after all, I enjoy the game even tho 1/3 games gives a hacker and 1/2 games give a high chance of dropping you in a game full of russians.VALVE, fix your game like the PEOPLE want it:- 128-tick servers- Better VAC system, even tho half the pro's gets banned- Fix bugs in the game / maps instead of adding gloves just to get more money- Different servers for RU / EU with no way to mix those together- Fix those damn hitboxes- Add that's it recommended to have a microphone and have some basic English knowledge.Game: 8/10 Good game in general, could use some better hitboxesMaps: 7/10 Some maps just have so low FPS for people it's unplayableDev's: 5/10 Give a lot broken updates but fixes them more or less within 2 weeksServers: 6/10 Some Valve servers are laggy and they should be split between RU / EU / Asia / US Total: 6.5/10Would I buy it again?: To play a broken game with russians? Hell yeah! 10/10 would buy again.			"

												This community is rapidly going to hell...Its quite apparent that the so called Professional players of this game over 65% are hacking which can be viewed on youtube which the Developers allow them to do such as its consistently brining in revenue.Average Player base these people tend to buy seperate accounts to play with lower ranking players to make a name for themseleves of how great they are. Streamers tend to get carried to ranks that they can't play at and then state how they are having a bad day because the people who carried them to that rank can't play with them that day. The lower end players the brand new players tend to buy game hoping to have fun and get trolled all the time. One of the current issues they have adjusted for the game is kicking players+leaving game are rolled into a negative effect. This should be 2 separate issues, If i kick someone for being an♥♥♥♥♥or going afk too many times and per that week I am already on a 2 hour ban from leaving a game I then recieve a 24 hour ban. So say you have a player that goes afk mid game how do you get rid of him wait til he disconnects to be able to use a bot to even the playing field. However this game allows you to mess with settings in console so now you have players going afk the whole game by running in circles in spawn thus never leaving due to creating an action in game. So the only resolution is to kick them...However if you have kicked multiple people or in that week's time had a cooldown you will get a much longer cooldown for doing something postive.Gun drops in game have been reduced it use to be you would recieve between 4-6 drops a week now your lucky to get 2 drops usually cases which require a $2.49 key to open. So as this has gotten less and less the Community has begun promoting underage gambling websites to gamble your skins in hopes to getting better skins to make profit off of game. Which is disturbing when you connect to the game and you hear a 9 year old talk about his up's and down's with gambling his skins away....I would not recommend buying this game unless you intend on being a troll and can stand not getting agrravated by other trolls on this game.

												I have played this game since October of 2013 and nothing has been fixed, they continue to add broken weapons and being unable to properly balance weapons, the Tec9 is still OP, it took them months to fix the CZ, the M4A1-S is still the king of CT weapons due to its lowered spread, recoil, and higher damage at ranges. The hitboxes are still awful because of how animations are blended and not snapped into place, you need to be rank 3 to play Competitive even if you're a Global Elite or Legendary Eagle Master, meaning you have to play with Silvers for 6 hours if you want to play Competitive, it's especially bad considering you have to buy an Operation Bloodhound pass to get XP faster. They should've just kept it the same as it was in January of 2013 without the flash boosting, the C4 planting and jumping hitboxes were still messed up but it was generally just a better game. I refuse to play this game until they fix the hitboxes, which has no ""ETA"" currently but ""Valve has acknowledged it"" so basically they said ""screw you, we're not fixing the hitboxes, thanks for the money.""What a joke of a game developed by a joke of a company, I can't believe that they have let the game get to this state, and Valve's support is a joke in general, enjoy waiting 2 weeks to get a reply.EDIT: I know all the dumb and blinded fanboys are going to dislike this review, but believe me, you will feel this way when you actually look at the technical aspects of this game, and believe it or not, there IS a game beyond betting and skins! I know, hard to believe.			"

INTRO:✓ So i gave a thought for long time about what i'm going to write down on this review since it's one of my favourite games on steam.GAMEPLAY RATING:✓ So far i can tell that the gameplay really makes fun especially the gungame , deathmatch mode and the normal casual stuff. Developers definetly achieved to create a varied and half way balanced game elements in this fps game.they still do some updates and make some changes by and then just to appear it more interesting.✓ From the point of technical aspects they succed so far ( at least in my opinion ) , because all different weapons can be used for certain situation so there aren't many weapons which are superior to others, in addition you can balance this by teamwork and strategic actions. Yes this game is not only about skill, it's more relying on teamwork , which is also an interesting fact about this game, because high skill doesn't mean anything to this game.COMPETETIVE OR NOT? :✓ For me there are only two sides of this game : Competetive and non competetive✓ For the non competetive part i can give a recommendation, because it bonds a lot of fun and variation for players.✓ In contrast for the competetive part, unfortunatly  i can't give a recommendation. You sure ask why.The reason is the community itself, it's poisoned with pathetic low self-esteem people who create smurf accounts in order to hack and ruin the game, and as if it's not enough they also insult for no reason . they probably do it to strenghten their self-esteem or maybe they need mental help i don't know , somehow or other it's really bad.Almost every match i only read on the chat "" look on my main account im *insert here high rank*"" . so if this is the case why are they even owning a second account then? and making hacks appear so obvious?! i really don't know. And before people come to me and to label me as a low player, my highest rank so far was Supreme master First Class, but i don't care about such stuff, it just ruins my mood to encounter obvious frauds who also try to insult you via mic or chat just because they don't have got any balls in real life. that's why it is so pathetic. In addition some random players in your team also do some mistakes on purpose to ruin your day more. i mean i play this game to get rid of my stress and all i get in return is only more stress. i wouldn't even care if i would lose all the time, when i could be sure that they aren't hacking or insulting each other like 10 years old  kids. It's also a sad fact that people think big of them by hacking and can't even speak a single word in english, like if they are some uneducated people or anything.✓ i will still play this game, probably because i still have faith in humanity, but so far i only got disappointed.TO CUT A LONG STORY SHORT:✓ Recommendation for non competetive games : YES✓ Recommendation for competetive matches: NO✓ The decision is still up to you.

												Do not open cases, for the love of god. You see that  you have $5+ on your steam account. You feel the urge that you will get ""an exceedingly rare special item""You spend $2.50 and open a case. Tick tick tick..... It stops on a blue gun. You feel this depression, but also this rush going to your head. You decide to spend another $2.50 believing that this special key is the one to get you ""an exceedingly rare special item"". Tick tick tick... time slows down as the line scrolls past multiple useless gun skins. You see it.... Time stops and you look at that beautiful Yellow Circle. Somehow, you manage to calculate the rate at which the line is travelling to determine if it will land on the yellow circle. You can also apparently have a very large IQ during this short time frame. You heart starts to beat much quicker, you know that it's going to land. You know you can finally brag to your friends that you got a knife from a case. You are so excited you almost knock the glass off the table...But your whole life flips upside down... You realise you failed Physics in High School and that your calculations were completely off. You see it... The line stopped 1 tick away from your beautiful Factory New Stat trak Karambit | Fade. You see that cursed Mil-Spec Skin worth 7c on the Steam Market. You press the Power button on your computer and walk over to your bed. You lie down and close your eyes, tears running down your face.

												Counter Strike Global Offensive is essentially a game of clicking on heads (from what I learnt in my first 200 hours). The objective of the game is to click on your opponent's head before s/he can click on yours.Oh and there are bombs, hostages, skins and knives but thats beside the point.In conclusion: Learn how to click on heads...

												Counter Source: Global Office is a great video game to play on the internet.  Personally, I like to play multiplayer more than single player. However, multiplayer is more difficult because the enemies shoot back.  I think they should nerf the sniper because people can kill me in one shot even when i buy the helmet!  This game is very tough but fun.  I heard that the pros warm up before their matches by playing minecraft so that's what I do too.			"

												Non-Prime ( to become prime must be rank 21 + verified phone number) Is an absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥pool. There is always at least 1 hacker in every lobby, when you're about to accept a match you only hope that the hacker will be on your team. Not to mention the abundance of people playing on alts and pounding lower rank tiers. I've been in multiple games where it's been hack vs hack all in competitive game mode. Also, Prime just filters out 70% of hackers, you will still run into hackers in prime. Reaching rank 21 is also a absolute grind could take several months. Fix your♥♥♥♥♥♥valve.tldr: Rank 21 is a grind, Too Many Smurfs & Vac, Vac doesn't work for♥♥♥♥♥♥Update: There is no point arguing amongst each other, this is a serious issue that needs to be addressed by valve, you may think I'm a noob who is fresh to csgo, but this isn't the case I've had csgo since release in 2012, played source & 1.5 before that(sorry off-topic). We should all unite and get our word across to valve cause this is just absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. CS:GO is broken and Valve needs to improve on these issues.			"

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, ""if you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately."" Tears welled up in his eyes when he realised what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												Its been 3 years sinc Im playing this game and following pro scene very closly. I guess, its time for a very short review.Heads up to the community for making Counter Strike as one of the biggest e-sports titles again.But if anything else - this game is pretty big pile of crap. IIRC, its march 2014, sinc development of this game is going only downhill trajectory (CZ-75 update it is). Not only swallowing up updetes has been painful, but also watching how problems arent adressed for yeras. But when volvo try to take care of issue, you can be shure that it will be one step in the right direction and atleast 3 steps backwards (ladders and hitboxes, sound, etc.). Eventually picture makes sense - brain cell non existence of humanity has been taken to whole new level. In the end there was only one ingredient that was necesasry. Despite about feeling that this game is more like skin simulator with jackpots and betting sites within past year or so, volvo did two things right - skins and micropayments. Without necessary evil Counter Strike would be alive in 2016? Not so sure. Nonethless about game itself, its been amazing years together with pro scene, lets hope that one day this game will become a truly great e-sports title and in 2016 it will not be destroyed by someones greed and careless, because with todays features this game have potential atleast to be as good as Counter Strike 1.6 still is.

There are stories to be shared of when you're down 2-13 and you come back and win. I know I have these stories to share. Do you?			"

												This modern version of one of the best competitive games of all times does a good job in introducing new players to this highly tactical and skill-based gaming experience. If you are a veteran of the old days – CS:GO might disappoint you. It sure looks nice but lacks the precision that made CS 1.6 so damn good. It´s still a very good Counter-Strike, though.It may lack some of the community niceties, beloved maps, and little features of past games, but Global Offensive delivers on the promise of a faithful, polished, and better looking Counter-Strike for whoever wants it. Even if the community doesn't meet the golden standard of 1.6 and Source, CS:GO will remain a multiplayer classic for those willing to put in the time to learn the maps and weapons.Brilliant old-school shooter has convinced us that Counter-Strike franchise is in no way to be retired or forgotten.At the end, what matters is not if CS:GO is innovative or more of the same than CS: Source, what counts is if it's fun. And CS:GO couldn't be better in this regard.			"

												If CS:GO was a girl. I'd date her, and ♥♥♥♥ her a lot. Then after that get frusterated because of things she does that doesn't make sense but still be with her. Then we'd have sex again. When we're in bed I'd be killin' it ontop, but when she's ontop I just absolutely hate it as she dominates me. After that we'd get into a fight about who was better that round and we'd always end the fight at a negative note. The next day I'd start talking to her again and the cycle goes on and on. CS:GO is the equivalent to an abusive relationship. 10/10 would recommend just because being ontop feels pretty good in this game.			"

												As an old school CS 1.6 player I've been disappointed to see this game evolve downwards over the years. I've been giving it multiple chances but it just cannot grow on me no matter what, it doesn't radiate the same vibes as it's predecessors. No it's not nostalgia taking the wheel here, you will find a ton of things what made CS 1.6 / CSS great which are very wrongly implemented in GO. This game's main focus has been skins & revenue for the last 3 years; if anyone thinks otherwise they sure live in a thick little bubble.[✔]> competitive matchmaking system> new weapons therefore more strats> you learn russian[✘]> development focused on aesthetics> terrible matchmaking balance> hit registration & hitbox (feels like p2p)> lack of custom skins (mod which only you see)> awful anti-cheat for one of the most played games> not made by Valve			"

But it was a years ago, untill the new update making the MM become sucks. I dont know why, but its like the V.A.C Security is so weak now adays, i meet a lot of cheaters, wallers, aimbot out there without getting banned. Seen so much overwatch replay that contain a lot of reported hacker waiting to be punished but none of them get punished soon.I do want to recommend this game, but today, i think there's no need to buy this game anymore, its like you just spend your $15 for meeting a cheater in MM.

												It's surely the best CS so far, if you can overlook the fact that competitive matchmaking ranks mean nearly nothing, as well as if you can deal with being kicked and consequentially put in matchmaking cooldown by a team of four people. You can also invest few thousands of dollars to buy fancy weapons.A good game in the end, but only if you play it with friends.edit: 31 May 2015

A Sophisticated CS:GO Review.Alright, it's time for a honest and sophisticated CS:GO review, no hate, just criticism.I've played this game since the beta of around August 2012, and I'm here to tell you that it didn't really get any better.It went all from a competitive team-shooter to a game that's more about the skins than about the actual content featured in the game. For example, we've had a few operations that actually added some new gameplay style, but then again, you need to pay for those. And most of the time the updates revolves around some case with some new community skins in it. (Valve to lazy to design own skins).And then there's the community, now I know there's alot of actual good people out there, but the majority of them are,  you guessed it, Russians/Polskis.Now i don't mind people from Russia or Poland aslong as they play normally, which is most of the time not the case. Most of the Russians / Polski I've met in game are just general derankers and or griefers. Personally I don't really give much about a matchmaking rank other than the bragging rights, but derankers and griefers just take the fun out of my game, and that's just not cool. The most important thing about a game is to have fun, right? Well sadly I cannot say I can recommend to play this game solo if you expect a fun match.And then there's the new matchmaking system everybody keeps talking about. I've experienced it myself, I've lost a couple ranks myself, but from a personal point of view, I don't see much trouble in it. Ofcourse, it's not fun to lose 3 ranks if you win 9 and lose 1 and get deranked. But the real thing is, if you really have the skill I'd recommend playing other things than matchmaking. (like ESEA, FaceIt, LANs) I can understand that people get frustrated if they lose their hard earned ranks, and I agree with them that it's a pretty stupid update, but Valve won't revert the update anytime soon, so it's best to learn to play with it.Overwatch and matchmaking bans are flawed. Overwatch doesn't work because most of the players can't see the difference between a good player, and an actual hacker. Sometimes someone makes sound, and the Suspect just has very good sound so he hears him. Lower ranking players aren't able to hear or see this and convict him of wallhacking. Matchmaking bans are bad because too much team damage and you get kicked. But for example, I throw a firebomb and my Russian team runs into it and stays in it on purpose, then I get banned. Also accidental grenades while rushing are also a part on this.As this review comes to an end, I cannot recommend this game anymore.It used to be alot better back when the gameplay actually matters, but right as of now, VALVE is only interested in filling their wallets. The result is a very broken game with broken mechanics, and not so community-approved updates. (R8 back in release.)Thank you for reading.			"

												PLEASE READ BEFORE VOTING THIS DOWNI cannot recommend it because this game destroys people. It's a good game but at a terrible cost.No, Im not some anti-gaming freak, I love games.But truth said, this is a great game, but it will kill you inside.Matchmaking is well made so you usually get paired with equal to average of your team.When it's easy and you wreck havoc, it's too easy, boring, unsatisfying.If it's challenging and hard, or you're loosing, you keep worrying about your stats, skill and rank.You are either bored and dissatisfied or stressed and angry. Either at yourself or the rest of your team(that other happens more often).If you live in europe, this game will only make you racist. You will hate on every person that cannot speak english or your very own language for not being able to communicate with you, or refusing to communicate with you.Maybe at first you wont experience all that by playing casual where people usually don't care, but once you try competetive, you look at casual with disgust. The better you get, the more hateful towards other players you will be. You will not remember how bad you used to be, you will hate all the noobs, skrubs and casuals. You will judge people by their skins, weapons of choice and headshot ratio. Everyone you dislike will be labeled as cheater.Where is the fun in all this, I ask? You can be proud of yourself when you win, or survive in an action where you were meant to die, but each and every accomplishment you'll get will make you crave for more, and at one point you won't feel much from winning, but you will feel a lot from losing.

 Don't play CSGO if you can't tolerate cheaters, racism, hatred amongst players (even your own teammates), and under average servers.  Focusing on the quality of servers, my experience has been a 5/10 satisfaction with them. Even though my connection is less than 50 ping, with minimal packet loss, choke, and ""var"", I have often not been able to kill someone point blank with a FULL clip. Now you might say I'm just ""bad"" but I've been playing this game for almost 2 months(Yes that's more than 1400 hours!), and the game's physics are like my third hand by now. This is just outrageous that the official valve competitive servers can be this bad. You're better off playing on 3rd party leagues such as ESEA, that have decent servers, and more often than not, cooperative teammates. Moreover, the competitive servers are full of edgy, underaged players who talk down to the opposing team aswell as their own, regardless of your skill. There is an option to mute other players but that just ruins the entire point of the game if you can't communicate with your own team in order to fabricate a strategy to win the round. Nevertheless, that's bound to happen in any game, but its been on the rise on CSGO servers since its debut in August 2012.    However, if you can ignore all of which I've told you so far, and you're fond of shooters different from Call of Duty and Battlefield, then this game is for you.  "

												Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, is probably the most balanced Fps game in all existence. I personally started playing Counter Strike when Source had been out for 2-3 years or so. I've always enjoyed the close quarters strategic combat, and the fact that the game is all skill.The're are no unlockables, the only things you can ""earn"" by playing are stats, and skins.

Let Me share My Recent MM experience .Yesterday we went 0-1 CT side Dust2. One guy called gg, called everyone noobs and went AFK until round 4, and his friend ragequit and rejoined on round 4 so he wouldn't have to bother playing the eco rounds. We ended up winning 16-5, regardless of all the GG calls and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s at the start.

I muted them all as soon as they just started giving each other♥♥♥♥♥♥in a shouting match at the start of round 2. When I unmuted at 14-4 they were all best ♥♥♥♥ing buddies. Giving each other calls, ""nice shot guy!"", ""well played guys"" and all that.CS:GO  in a nutshell -> Win and you'll make friends for life, lose and you're just another boosted silver♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing noobs gg.

												If you like first person shooters, look no further.  This one is by far one of the best online multiplayer  first person shooters I have ever played. A game recommended for players with ""First Person Shooter"" experiencePros+ Game Mechanics is not like other games    + Different weapons with a totally different weapon recoil    + Running and gunning with rifles don't work that well    + No aim down sight on most weapons (sorry Call of Duty and Battlefield fans)    + No prone (again sorry Call of Duty and Battlefield fans)        + in result, difficulty in simplicity+ Needs a lot of skill and variety of play styles+ Competitive+ Always room to improve+ Team game (communication and strategies)+ Fun with friends+ A huge variety of different weapons to choose from+ A huge variety of fun workshop mapsCons- Hard for new players    - Smurfs (people that are way more experienced teamed against inexperienced players)    - Variety of maps, and game modes to learn               - Call outs: names of parts of the map to learn              - A lot of map knowledge required- Frames Per Second drops, uncommon. (Lag)- Hackers (Cheaters) => [They eventually get banned, loss won't count against you]- Community can get annoying or frustrating at times (uncommon 0-2/20 players per game)- Limited of servers, Europe plays with Russians that cannot speak English.- Maps tend to be CT sided. (slightly) Any further questions about the game? Here is a quick guide, and quick links to sections of the discussion forum if you have any further questions about the game.

												Honestly, what can i say about CS:GO. This game is a little tricky to get used to but after a while, you'll really enjoy the game. Being able to jetpack across the sky and trickshot the enemy for the game winning kill has to be one of the best things i've ever done on this game. Although the zooming in function may be alittle buggy, the iron sights for the AK and M4 are amazing. Leveling up and getting new attachments for weapons make the game even more fun that it already is. I hope that everyone will consider trying out the game and enjoy all the fun things that make this the best Call of Duty game out there. Thank you for reading.			"

												Great game that can teach you many things such as:1. The Russian language.2. How to be a tough guy that is afraid of nothing behind a screen.3. How to be racist and sexist.4. How to be spoiled as ♥♥♥♥.5. How awesome it feels to shout through your microphone and giving invalid instructions while someone is trying to pull off a clutch.6. How to be disappointed in human beings.7. How to socialise in a civilised and calm manner (/s).And last but not least, how to be a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for no reason at all.Aside from that, if you're willing to ignore the aforementioned it can be a truly great game. It has many goals for you to achieve if you wish other than the obvious goal of getting the highest ranking possible. You could always aim to get that gorgeous weapon skin you always wanted potentially without spending any money at all. It is highly recommended you find a few people to play with as solo queue is extremely toxic, harsh and often rude, as in every other game that has competitive matchmaking. Having 4 people to play with can be extremely fun since you can easily bond together and have fun either you win or lose. It's a good game and I do recommend it as long as you're willing to ignore the (Admittedly plenty of) things that are wrong with this game. Even if you don't, it can easily be worth it if your skin is thick enough or you can utilise (If you got the balls really) self-deprecation humour.			"

												~ Updated Review ~CS:GO can be a fun experience or a game you'll get super tilted in, this game is by far the top first person shooter on the market. Don't waste your time with free to play games and have them shut down here and there. CS:GO usually goes on sale every once in a while but I have to say it's worth it's full price if you don't want to wait. ~ Competitive Match Making ~If you are playing alone then you could run into a lot of stress when it comes to the randoms. This isn't always the case but be prepared. Competitive match making is a pain at times but a great place to start. ~ Servers ~Servers are good for the majority of the time and the game does allow you to set a max acceptable ping in case you are getting stuck in high ping games. The servers are 64 tick in match making and this may cause a feeling of inaccuracy when aiming. The good thing is that eSports such as Cevo, faceit and esea all use 128 tick servers which will allow you to connect your shots better. Practice first, eSports is a max skill level but there will be players much better than you if you are new.~ The Community ~The community can be a bit aggressive and trolly but you'll find loads of guides and helpful users around forums, youtube and in game.----Overall I would reccommend this game 100% if any friend asked if it was worth it.

												I purchased this game on release day and played it for about three hours. It was absolute crap and I un-installed it.Fast forward almost one year and my friend recommended I try it again. Well, i've got to say that the game has come a long way and has vastly improved from it's release version.The game is basically 1.6 with improved graphics and mechanics. While it still needs work in many areas, the current state of the game is highly enjoyable and worth the mediocre price of $14.99.If you're a long time CS player like me (Beta 1) and don't have this game yet, add me to your friends list and we'll reminisce about the old days and maybe i'll throw a copy your way.

												It's hard to argue that this game is probably the best CS release since 1.6. Some will disagree, might argue Source is a better game and they will have their own valid points. In my opinion this game is a true sequel. It brings the fun and nostalgia from the earlier versions of CS, the same flowing game play that made it popular and the heavy emphasis on team game play. It mates the old with the new; the expectations that a FPS be somewhat realistic if not fun to play. It's a modern game; it looks and plays like modern games should but it all looks a bit familiar, like the hot girl from years past that you bump into 10 years later. CS:GO is more technical and team oriented than previous games in the series. Shooting, movement, sound and grenades are completely different and you have to master them once again. Weapons now have a purpose - there's a reason to buy the 5-7 and P250, as well as the MP5 replacement, MP7. Team play is just as important as the economy; once you lose it there's no coming back.It's a demanding skills based that's as satisfying as any CS title has been. Pros: - Updated maps, visuals & sounds - Emphasis on team play - Valve online matchmaking as well as valve casual servers - Extensive customisability & player drops - More realistic player and game behaviour - CS:GO workshop - Pro players - Active development and regular updates - Listens to community - Low-end modern PC requirements for top quality & top resolutionCons: - Gungame isn't the same as CS:S - Because of different skills & tactics, CS:S players will feel like it's a familiar but new game. Skills are transferrable one way, not so much the other; when you play CS:S after CS:GO it will feel and sound like you're playing underwater. - Sound still seems like an afterthought - You will need to upgrade your video card to something made in the last 3 years if you want something that's playable and looks goodRatings:Graphics: 8.5/10, far improved on previous models but there's still room for improvementSound: 8/10, feels like an after-thought, if there's one complaint I have about the game it is that the sound quality and engine just isn't good enoughGameplay: 9.5/10, excellent and extremely playable game with very high replayabilityOverall: 8.5/10, it's a great game and could easily be 9.5 out of 10 with improved audio and slight improvements in visual quality. It's a modern twist on an old classic.Footnote:I lost my way with CS after CS:S and I turned to a variety of other games. Battlefield 1942/2142/2/3, Tom Clancy Rainbow 6, America's Army 2/3/PG. Before then I was an avid player of CS and I would play up to 100 hours per month. When I played CS 10 years ago I always asked, why can't this game be a little more realistic? Why can't they stop people from shooting through 3 walls 20 metres apart and killing with me an awp? Why do grenades act like balloons and float through the air? I can't really emphasise how happy I am that a lot of what shouldn't happen has been removed and the overall quality of visuals, sound and game play has been improved.In the first month of playing I managed to rack up 200 hours of gameplay and I've started contributing back to the community with maps.

												Maybe the only FPS where it truly boils down to a game of pure skill. No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t perks or kill streaks, no auto-turrets, no air strikes. If you want to win in Counter-Strike, you have to learn the maps, play smart, and have fast reflexes. Since you work for each and every kill, it's much more satisfying than other current gen shooters. It's a real shame that the console version isn't closer to the PC version though, they could have given COD a run for their $.			"

												I bought this game for the chickens, and was not disappointed. After exploring the countless lands the chickens have traveled far and wide, I realized their population was growing too large. The chickens had started to inhabit such horrid locations across the world, such as nuclear plants, and offices without cafeterias. I knew what had to be done. I bought a flip knife off of the steam market, and called PETA. I listened to In the Arms of an Angel in my Microsoft Professional Deluxe Gaming Chair 360 for about twelve hours with no response, so, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery. I cried harder that night than I have ever before. The next morning, with tears in my eyes, I loaded up Counter-Strike: Global Chicken, and I saw a new item waiting in my inventory. My Flip Knife had turned into a Flip Knife Slaughter. At that moment, I realized what a horrible thing I had done. With my hand shaking, I navigated my mouse, and uninstalled Counter-Strike: Global Chicken. I regret everything I have done. I am writing this review to warn you about the chickens, and to let you know I have made a full recovery, and that I have started my new journey in Goat Simulator. Thank you, and farewell.			"

												CS:GO is a game which was once designed around team-based attacks and defenses, something which has since been replaced by weapon reskins and recoil patterns.Pros: ¤Very easy to hop into a casual game and enjoy a quick game.¤Very easy to join a competitive game and work with a team of nearly equal skill-levels in a longer game with higher tensions.¤New game modes to choose from.¤Wide variety of powerful weapons at your disposal.¤Betting scene.¤Numerous competitive leagues and teams for highly skilled players.Cons:¤Difficult to master weapons and recoil patterns.¤Luck plays a considerable role in fights.¤Learn a plethora of new insults from teammates.Conclusion: For 15$, it's worth every penny.

												The basic concept of competive Counter-Strike match has changed very little in the past 17 years:  5 terrorists and 5 counter-terrorists fight each other in order to detonate/defuse bomb or eliminate  entire enemy team to win. Same old story but everything is polished to a perfection. You usually find a competive match within a minute and game is ready to start usually within 5 minutes. When playing other game modes a game is usually ready for you almost instantly.CS:GO servers are really stable and I have never experienced a server or game crash. If one players happens to quit/drop/crash player is automatically replaced by a computer controlled bot. This is a great improvement as one or even two players quiting no longer means 100% sure lost.There are multiple gaming modes available and while most people play just competive I strongly suggest atleast trying Arms race and demoliton modes. They offer far more easy going, less stressful and quicker game sessions.Counter-strike has always been all about teamplay. Playing competive is almost pointless without a microphone which is the best way to discuss with other teammates. Typing with keyboard is not good enough because gameplay is so fast-paced. You get most out of this game when you are playing with friends. Most of the CS:GO community seems to be younglings and that means there will be a lot of swearing, bullying, insulting and bad sense of humor. Pretty much in every single game with strangers.I have played Counter-Strike since 1999 and playing CS has never been as easy & smooth as it is today with CS:GO. Easy to learn for people new to fps games and hard to master even for fps veterans.[HISTORY LESSON] Just to point out how easy competive match making is made in CS:go, I tell you how you found a competive match in early 2000's: First you had to gather 5 friends to play (sometimes you had to wait like an hour before you could find all the players, because everyone had to be part of the same clan/team,  you couldn't play with strangers). After that you had to go to a specific IRC chat channel to find your opponents (5 mins if you had a server of your own, up to an hour if you didn't). Then you confirmed the match with your opponents at Clanbase (A site that keep track with clans/teams wins and losses). Finally everything was set for all players to manually connect the game server. Use console command to start recording your gameplay (in order to proof after the game that you are were not cheating) and start playing. After the match upload your gameplay records to clanbase and pray that your opponents are kind enough to confirm the correct game score as soon as possbile in order to receive points from winning. [/history lesson]10 - Perfect game9 - Excelent game, best of the genre8 - Good game, worth your time7 - Average game, nothing really special6 - Bad game, avoid5 - Painful to play, completely waste of time4 - Failed game, unpayable			"

												Seriously ♥♥♥♥ this game. Prime Matchmaking is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. the last 5 games I've played with prime on, I get griefers on my team, the other team gets hackers, and nobody speaks ♥♥♥♥ing english. I was gold Nova master, until the update that brought everyone's rank down to silver. and I can top frag for 4 games in a row and i wont rank up, then i get stuck with griefers and smurfs for several games, bascially throwing me back to step 1 EVEN AFTER PRIME MATCHMAKING. The community is more cancerous than Call of Duty, as you get griefed whenever you try to ♥♥♥♥ing play a game. They either kill you, throw the bomb in unreachable spots, or pretend to diffuse the bomb, letting it blow up and kill you when you actually try to diffuse ♥♥♥♥ing thing. SO ♥♥♥♥ you csgo ♥♥♥♥ you Gabe, and most of all ♥♥♥♥ you cancerous csgo community.			"

												Time to do a serious review, after playing this for 1.3k hours, I feel that this is the weakest of the counter-strike series. it feels like it has been dumbed down to appeal to a larger audience, and I dislike how the developers are heading with the game. the new version of de_nuke was the final straw for me, skill based movement was one of the main reasons why I played CS. bhopping on csgo isn't worth learning as they have made it rediculously inconsistent. Every skill jump from nuke has been removed. Perfomance has been getting worse and worse with every update, making the game to the point of unplayable on my below average computer, whereas in source i get a constant 180+. EU matchmaking is a hellhole with so many languages shouting at each other, and developers flat out refuse to add servers for language prefrences like in dota 2. due to all these things , i have decided to go back to source as it still has a strong community. (albeit much smaller due to csgo taking the limelight.)			"

												This game is the successor to the original counter-strike aka CS 1.6. Ignore counter-strike: condition zero, and counter-strike: source, both those games never blew up as competitively as CS 1.6, and CS:GO. This game takes tons of practice, and patience. Nobody can just start off doing well, you might be decent if you can aim, but there are so many factors that come into play determining your skill level compared to your opponents.All of the above is true except for when I said nobody can start off doing well, I am one of the rare exceptions where I just dominate everything. I never lose, and have yet to lose. Maybe someone can tell me how it feels to lose. This game isn't fun as much for me anymore, because I never lose.			"

												Counter Strike Global Offensive in itself is a good game. We are getting frequent updates from the dev’s and the player count keeps increase. Rather than writing a lengthy summary of my opinions of the game I have decided to break it down into two groups of bullet points. **The Good*** High skill ceiling but easy to start FPS * Lots of fun to play with friends / make new friends * Many of the guns are viable unlike previous versions* Dev’s connect with the community and gradually make tweaks and ingame changes after deliberation. **Needs Improvment*** Visibility (HDR / Bloom are locked down unlike prior versions). * Upgraded anti cheat (too many hackers in higher elo MM). * Movement and accuracy modifications.* Some guns need further tweaking (Deagle / P90) * Valve servers need lower VAR / higher tickrate * **Overall Rating **8.5 / 10			"

												After several hours in this game, all I can say is that this game has the absolute worst community I have EVER SEEN in my entire life, and worse than Call of Duty's, Battlefield's, PAYDAY 2's, Team Fortress 2's, or Left 4 Dead's.CS:GO's community is the living embodiment of EVERYTHING that is wrong with the gaming community.You get insulted by either your teammates or the enemy team for EVERY little thing, on Casual, and ESPECIALLY in Competitive, and you can't mute them either because you have to somehow find some useful information that's buried underneath the childish and immature insults from these manchildren and kids that love talking♥♥♥♥♥♥because you can't physicallly punch them in the face in real life because of distance.The virginity, girlfriendless, sexism (I've seen really immature and horny ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that prey on girls, and I've also seen stupid, ♥♥♥♥♥♥, attention seeking girls on this game as well that bait guys), anti-social, fanboyism, nerdism, sociopathy, childishness, manchildishness, and immaturity are at maximum here in this game.Then there's these clutch or kick nerds that can't ever give you a ♥♥♥♥ing chance and are constantly pressuring you and cause you to fail, then they put up a votekick against you and kick you out for losing ONE round even though you're most likely leading and carrying the entire team, and winning the match as well, and it's worse if you're in a Competitive match when this happens because of the ♥♥♥♥ing cooldown system, which is another issue with this game. You can even get banned for votekicking too many players or get banned when it's not your fault (say the power goes out or your PC has to restart and are unable to make it back in time, or need to leave the match for something important in real life.) And that♥♥♥♥♥♥can last up to 1 hour to 7 damn days.Then there's these rank nerds (honestly the worst part about CS:GO) who love to belittle others (especially towards Silvers) because of their rank as if a ♥♥♥♥ing rank in a VIDEO GAME means something important in real life. If you want a rank that actually means something, then join the ♥♥♥♥ing military or the police, you know, REAL LIFE situations that actually MATTER.This game isn't very friendly to newcomers of the series either, as they also get insulted for not being good at a game they're NEW to and/or being a Silver rank.Again, join the ♥♥♥♥ing military or the ♥♥♥♥ing police if a rank matters so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ much to you.And let's not forget Community servers either, which are chock full of power-hungry and abusive badmins (one of the things ruining Battlefield 4), that abuse their admin powers, mute people, slap, damage, kick, and ban people because they think admin powers makes them above human rights. You're not a ♥♥♥♥ing cop, you're an admin of a server that means literally nothing, and I hope you NEVER join the police force despite me saying that you should join them if ranking means so much to you. And if not for anything, people will always find SOME ♥♥♥♥ing reason to try and♥♥♥♥♥♥you off because they're too busy being the basement dwelling failures at life that they really are.Valve clearly doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about anything other than milking this game like a ♥♥♥♥ing cow to line dumbass Newell's pockets for his next McDonald's purchase (when honestly, this fatass should instead be getting himself a gym membership), because instead of fixing issues in the game that break it and allowing the game to be modded (like how Source, Condition Zero, and 1.6 could, and those were WAAAAAAAY better games than this horsevomit), they'd rather stick to releasing Operations and crappy knife models, and weapon skins (AKA DLC's) to milk every cent out of CS:GO, which is the very same cancer that's killing off TF2, and I'm surprised they cared enough to fix the ♥♥♥♥ing netcode and hit boxes in this game (which was another major issue plaguing the game for a very long time).Seriously, look at the ♥♥♥♥ing prices in the Steam community market for CS:GO, and you'll see skins that'll rise up to $400 maximum. Seriously? $400 for a ♥♥♥♥ing Karambit knife spray painted blue with StatTrak?I literally can do all of that with a Karambit in real life for less than $50, but these CS:GO nerds and fanboys want to draw the ""supply and demand"" card as if this were a real economy and like this♥♥♥♥♥♥actually mattered as opposed to playing the actual game itself.This is the absolute worst game Valve has ever produced, and it's all thanks to the community, because to be quite honest, when you're NOT surrounded by and dealing with the ♥♥♥♥ing abysmal community in this game (which is rare), this game can actually be VERY fun and engaging (like the CS I used to know back in the 90's and early 2000's) as well as enjoyable.I was actually VERY excited to hear about this game coming out back in 2012 until I realized how bad Valve ♥♥♥♥ed up with CS:GO and how the community increases the destruction by 150%.This game has legitimately caused me a lot of stress (and I mean legitimate stress) from the idiots I meet whether it's in Casual, Competitive, or Community servers, I can't get away from the Internet tough guys and keyboard warriors who I'd love to put on life support.Hell, I even have a video posted on YouTube on how awful this community is:

			I had no idea this game was going to take so long! Developer: Valve http://store.steampowered.com/app/730/ 🌟-Join my Steam Group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/GamingTaylor ⭐️Twitter:...		

And that video is just the tip of the iceberg of how ♥♥♥♥ing atrocious this community is.DO NOT even consider buying this regurgitated dogshit. It's not worth $15, or even $0.01 of anyone's money.It's ♥♥♥♥ing cancer in software form.Again, invest your money in CS 1.6, Condition Zero, or Source, you know, the REAL Counter-Strike games and actual GOOD games that's worth money.And I bet you the neckbearded CS:GO fanboys who are still fat virgins with no girlfriends that dwell in their parents' basement all day are going to get butthurt and activate their defense mode and attack this review.Honestly, go ahead, I don't care, because you're only proving my point on how pathetic of a community you kids are considering one of you fanboys wish cancer on me over a VIDEO GAME.UPDATE: So Valve a little while ago released an update that fixed all of the hit registration issues that I spoke about earlier. They're definitely taking a step in the right direction and the game itself has been improving greatly, but one thing, which is unfortunately out of Valve's control is the community. It is still the very same toxic and cancerous community as I've stated earlier. Situations like this make me wish there was a yellow button instead of just a red and green one, because while the game is great, I can only recommend it to people who can get past this terrible community.

I'm probably going to get ripped by veterans due to my ""low"" playtime, but I felt like CS:GO deserved a proper review. Let's hop right into it, shall we?Originally designed as a Half-Life mod more than a decade ago, Counter-Strike has endured because of its well-balanced, competitive gameplay that requires skill to succeed. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a revamped version of the classic first-person shooter, offering some tweaked modes on the same maps that helped define the series. Those unfamiliar with Counter-Strike will find the game more a cerebral experience instead of the run ‘n gun, arcade-style action popularized by recent iterations of Call of Duty.In Global Offensive, there is no regenerating health, no cinematic storyline, no experience points to level up your soldier, and no unlockable kits or perks. The deterrent for dying is having to sit out and watch as the rest of the match unfolds. While this may sound disappointing to those weaned on more contemporary shooters, Global Offensive' comparatively pared-down experience is no less thrilling. The game's focus on teamwork and tactics gives the game a distinctive feel as you choose between four online game types as part of a terrorist or counter-terrorist faction.Classic Casual and Classic Competitive are team-based modes played in multiple rounds. The goal in each is to either eliminate the opposition or be the first team to complete a map-related objective. Depending on the map and your faction, you'll either rescue or defend four hostages, or either plant or defuse bombs at two specific sites. While the goals in both Classic Casual and Classic Competitive are the same, the differences between the two are primarily in terms of scope. A Classic Competitive game consists of 30 rounds instead of 10, enables friendly fire, and has you earning money for kills, planting bombs, and so forth that's used to purchase armor and defuse kits. The casual variant gives you armor and defuse kits automatically.The other two modes consist of Arms Race and Demolition. Arms Race, which has been adopted by both Call of Duty: Black Ops and Battlefield 3's Close Quarters expansion, consists of a single round where everyone begins with the same weapon. Each kill automatically changes your weapon until you receive the golden knife. The first person that lands the killing blow with the knife wins the round. This is the only mode where respawns are possible, offering a nice change of pace from the standard modes. Demolition is a mash-up of Arms Race and Classic, taking the fixed weapon progression from Arms Race and including two multi-round matches that have you trying to plant or defuse a bomb in a bank, safe house, and other locales.What makes Counter-Strike: Global Offensive appealing is that it plays differently from its competition. Tired of jumping assassins in other games? Jumping here will penalize your accuracy. Sick of seeing more praying and spraying than in a baptism ceremony? Then you'll appreciate that those who use short, controlled bursts while aiming will be more successful. If there is one knock on the game, it's that it offers the same maps as earlier versions of the series, giving veterans a huge advantage over new players. To offset this, the developers included an option to play against bots offline so you can practice each mode and map. This will give you a fighting chance against ""real"" players, but expect to die early and often until you hone your skills and familiarize yourself with the map layouts.Or course, the most important aspect of any multiplayer game is how much you want to play after a session ends. This is where Global Offensive excels, possessing the same addictive quality that helped make the previous games a long-term success story. Shooter fans looking to diversify their library or prove their mettle against a talented pool of players shouldn't hesitate to pull the trigger.Highly Recommended "

												TLDR: game with full potential: 7,5/10, game with community on most days: 3/10What is CS:GO? It is a game that uses mechanics that were last common around the year 2000, or rather around then some mechanics were absent in most big shooter titles that are still absent in CS:GO: no aiming down the sights or zooming in for most weapons, no sprinting, no leaning around corners, no weapon bashing, RNG plays somewhat a role while firing (that is how I explain how I have not killed some people at point blank range but I have scored headshots while jumping around spraying in peoples’ general directions…).What is good about it? I like the basic idea: short and sweet rounds that require a plan to win. One team needs to secure an objective (most commonly plant and detonate a bomb) in one of two possible locations while the other team succeeds by preventing the former team from reaching their goal. You need to hide well and rotate around the map in a timely fashion. Map knowledge and tactics theoretically get rewarded. This is a game that rests upon a good idea that gets better when playing with cooperative people.A thing you may or may not enjoy according to your personal taste are this game’s ‘microtransactions’ in the form of weapon skins and operation passes (temporary (!) access to maps and more skins). It is up to you as a player how much, if at all you care about these things. Be aware most of the community seems to be obsessed about these purely cosmetic skins and there are still a few elitists around who hate on people for not owning ‘nice’ skins (just a tip on what to expect from the community, more follows).What is critically bad about it? Valve do not appear to care about the state of the game, not the least about the community, or do not appear capable to solve its rampant issues.In the two years I have owned the game little has changed, except for the fact that assault rifles seem to be harder to stabilise (a so called nerf), a major competitive map that got reworked came out worse than before and at some point Valve thought it was a great idea to add a revolver that behaves like a one handed, one shot kill sniper rifle, except easier to handle (much to the dismay of those who care about balance).Also even in competitive matches I see players with high ping who lag. Match making in general seems to be off. In my own unranked matches I have faced players with almost a thousand hours of experience.More drastically, instead of finding an effective way to keep problematic players out they have added next to the competitive ranks new XP ranks and a system of cooldowns. So during your first dozens of hours of playing, you will often run into the game telling you you cannot play. Not being allowed to play a game which you have payed for is a feature, a bit peculiar how that works. A better solution  this game really needs in my opinion is a more thorough reputation system that separates the wheat from the chaff.I have mentioned the basic idea of this game is very good and it becomes better while playing with cooperative players. However these players are becoming (increasingly) harder to find which lowers the enjoyment found in this game immensely. When I start Insurgency, Arma or Verdun I expect to find well behaved people in each session. Queuing for a match in CS:GO by contrast feels like playing Russian roulette. Playing CS:GO on a regular basis requires you to become callous or unpleasant yourself to deal with other players. A match should routinely start with locating the problematic ones and muting and/or reporting these people. In the vast majority of matches you should expect to encounter at least one of these categories: a cheater using practically universally available and easily applicable ‘hacks’, a ‘smurf’ that intentionally plays on a lower level than his actual skill group (and hereby denying the chance to other people of having a fair match and ranking up themselves), a ‘deranker’ or group of ‘derankers’ who intentionally make their team lose the match (with or without the full agreement of the team) and finally a troll, ‘griefer’ or other general kind of person who behaves clinically mentally underdeveloped. Only once have I seen someone who I reported get a VAC ban. These cheaters and derankers organise themselves in Steam groups of sometimes tens of thousands of people and Valve do not seem interested in banning or removing these. In general, policing the community is nowhere on Valve’s task list according to my experiences. This poses a major problem for players who cannot rank up due to being defeated by cheaters, smurfs and griefing team mates, hence being stuck in the lower ranks or “Silver Hell”.Before I summarise this review, a few anecdotes of what concrete behaviour to expect from the community, all experienced over the course of one week.- On a daily basis: players from the same few language groups of preteen to adolescent age that keep spamming the same expletives in their native languages to you and never share useful information in a mutually comprehensible language. After a while and some googling you recognise the pattern that they are continuously expressing the desire to have various sorts of intercourse with your female family members and so on. Also randomly ‘vote kicked’ by these inclusive groups even if one is the best player of the team.- Me: “Very nice people, speak English please”. Them: “[rude refusal]”. Followed by a whole match of shouting torturing my eardrums. Instead we could have used sharing information and planning to win the match.- Derankers throwing mollies at themselves in spawn reducing the length of each round to five seconds.- Two people claimed to be smurfs, they played with pistols only and when we were miraculously salvaging the match they started committing team kills, tried to get team killed, obstructed team members, initiated random vote kicks, demanded we would abandon our weapons and more such trolling.- From a certain bunch: “Mother Mary is a pig”, “ISIS attack Brussels, haha!”, “Armenian genocide is big lie”, “suck-a my brown [male organ]”.- A Twitch streamer with a VAC ban on a three months old acount upon learning I had two friends with me who were new to the game: “gtfo, they’re [feces], NOOB, NOOB, IZI, NOOB, NOOB...”Number of truly pleasant matches in one week while regularly playing:  one.I became interested in CS:GO by watching youtubers like Anderzel. However now I feel a bit cheated and I realise these people only upload the one in twenty matches or so that runs its course without problems.In conclusion, the game itself in theory is easily worth 7/10 at least which is why some well meaning people such as I want to keep playing. In practice this score gets cut in half or worse. Be aware if you want to play and especially pay for this game, you are agreeing that you purchase an experience where you undergo abuse from the socially unadapted in all kinds of languages from all over the world, revealing the true meaning of the game’s name ‘Global(ly) Offensive’.Some people say it takes over a thousand hours to become truly competent at this game. This game only shines if you play with trustworthy people. If you are not yet committed to this game and you have no four mates to play along, decide for yourself if you want to play something else, go cycling, have dinner dates, play with your children for a thousand hours instead of listening most of that time to overly disrespectful screaming (pre)teens who do not wish to cooperate.

												Dear Santa,For Christmas, I would like for CS:GO to receive an AI overhaul. You see, when I play a game, and a teammate gets grumpy, they wind up leaving. That leaves me and my friends with a bot. This bot is not very bright and will often run out into anything, whether it be a smoke, an incendiary grenade, an AWP, or a five man rush of P90's and Tec-9's. At the very least, I would love for the AI to be able to sit down in a corner as though it were a chick hatching an egg everytime it was asked to ""stay here team"".SincerelyKim Jung-UnP.S. I've been very good at using my CS:GO betting money to feed the people of North Korea. It makes up 30% of our GDP.			"

												When Counter Strike: GO came out it wasn't very good, and the online servers was quite dead.But after a year of updates the game have become really good! I knew Valve and the team behind cs wouldn't let the cs fans down. Counter strike GO offers different gamemodes, improved graphics and overall options, a ranking system for those interested and a good variety of maps and weapons! The competitive scene have grown, and I think thats great. Unlike some other FPS, cs requires skill and training. When the game came out you couldn't customize the weapons very much, but now thats possible, with thousands of badass looking skins and stuff. CS:GO is really cheap compared to most competitors, so Im recommending it without doubt.			"

												I grew up on the series. Love and hate, but it always had some magic and made me come back. When I got the opportunity to play the CS:GO closed beta it was amazing. Top notch stuff, guns had a great feel back then, no stupid stickers or skins, no failed updates. Even the final product released a year ago was good.Since the introducing of the skins, performance went to the drain (bear in mind the Source engine is 10 years old now), stability is a word of a past and the COD effect among newcomers is at an all-time high. This is not even remotely satisfying.If you find 1.6 or CSS dear, DON'T SWAP! Otherwise, you will live to regret it. You'll become a twisted shadow of your former self, incapable of gaming on that proper level ever again when you go back out of frustration.The number of cheaters and the way the support/dev team does not care about this product - makes me want to vomit.WELCOME TO COMMUNITY TESTED PAYED BETA!7.10.14 Update:If your behinds hurt, I feel sorry for you. Focus on getting them random headshots we all get but never admit. And no, I do not mean the ones that kill us, but the ones that we frag mid air, mid run which should not even happen. But yes, you call that skill, cause it hurts the ego.			"

												This game has become a great FPS in my library. I played a CS mod many, many years ago (Tactical Ops: Assualt on Terror) and loved it always wanted to play it online but never could at that time. I finally bought Global Offensive and I've been impressed everything I was expecting and much more. It's a simple FPS with different modes search and destroy, hostange rescue, TDM, and more.I will give you the warning, it's very difacult to be good at this game. The level of compitition is great. I honestly can go into a game and suck and have fun or light up the scores and still have fun. I typically play just competitive matches where it's a 30 round game first team to 16 round wins wins the match. It varies by map as to which game mode you play and in each round you only get one life. Sounds hard right? Exactly! Competitive is a blast. I highly recomend this game if you like FPS and like playing online. Use stradegy, play with friends, play with strangers and remember DO NOT PLAY THIS WITHOUT HEADPHONES IF IN PUBLIC PLACE! ""The bomb has been planted is not something you want heard outloud. Just saying.My rating 9.5/10 very awesome game!			"

												Basic GameplayYou play as either a Counter-Terrorist or a Terrorist, both of which are deployed into a battlefield and each round are giving a small allowance to purchase weapons of their choice.You can make extra money by winning rounds or you could also hold a knife up to the enemy demanding their money, Although that would be risky since the enemy would likely just to shoot you.On the Terrorist team your goal is to plant and explosive near some uhhm.. important boxes?.Anyway, once plant wait You patiently for it to explode.As a Counter-terrorist you must eliminate all the Terrorist forces OR defuse the bomb, thus Protecting those ever important boxes from certain destruction.Being a honourable opponent, Terrorists are sure to set the bomb timer just long enough to give the Ct's the chance to Slaughter the remaining T's, and defuse the bomb.I'll list some positive/negative attributes of this game here.Positive attributes :- Matchmaking - Teaches children the harsh reality of gambling (although some never seem to learn even after $500 later)- Ranks  - Cool looking skins- Fast growing population of players  - Fat stacks of loot dropped somewhat often- Chickens- High replay value- Deathmatch game type (I could go into more detail on negative parts of it, but that would make this review too long and boring)Negative attributes :Although I Do love the single player campaign, it could use some work. I REALLY wish it were longer.. And that final Boss fight is pretty lame. It only lasts around 27 seconds, and during that time the only way to lose is by taking offense from the old man that constantly insults you, and how his ""7 year old could beat you, blindfolded.""- The game mode ""Infernal"" played on the map ""de_inferno""Some people like this game mode however I personally dislike it, For those of you that have not yet had the chance to experience it I'll explain for you.It seems like any normal de_ map However, The real goal is to scurry around finding any shred or scrap of rego, Normally it's hidden in obscurer unused sections of the map, and has the ability to shift/move around to different locations, Or even leave the game entirely for up to 10 minutes at a time.- Demolition, Also known as ""jokemode"" Added purely as a joke that volvo was supposed to only unlock on every April fool's day, However some hacker probably that ""4_chan"" guy, permanently unlocked it. (Volvo have been working on a fix ever since)Demolition is the game mode which automatically gives everyone amour and then requires you to get kills with weapons that do extremely poor damage against armoured opponents. Also no block is Enabled And Whoa?, So is team killing!The volka StrategyYou could just play this game like a noob and spend hundreds of dollars on skins, OR you could play the game correctly like me. Here is my strategy :-  Don't buy skins to start with, Seriously it's a waste of money.-  Play for a good 50 hrs or so and sell any drop you get.- Wait for a steam sale and Invest in as many copies of csgo you can.- Work your way up to about 5 copies or so But make sure you don't get too many otherwise you won't have enough time to harvest all your csgo account drops (having more than 7 accounts may have diminishing returns) [Note- it takes about 20 hrs gameplay to activate the drops].- Keep playing on all copies frequently to maximise drops.- Once you have your economy built up with this method you can now buy skins with all that free income you have. Remember to Never gamble with opening cases. I've made about $100 with this method. I think it's about time to quit my day job.In a whole, I do love this game And would recommend to anyone, Good half, Good half.			"

												Lets ignore the aggressive silvers and *cough* Russians *cough* and focus on some positive aspects:Gameplay 9/10The gameplay itself is on par with perfection, with customization options such as crosshair (shape, size, color ect), left or right handed play and of course the beautiful console interface which makes everything just THAT more simple. Very good :) Pixel-walkers will be shot.Graphics 8/10The graphics are very good, utilizing the source engine to it's full potential. Awesome maps, awesome scenery. Even skins that you can literally sell your soul for to make your play-style feel a little more... Classy. It better be worth it though because you're probably now homeless, because that FN Dragon Lore you just bought cost you a re-mortgage of your luxury condo.Sound and voice acting 10/10Beautiful sound, even back in Counter-Strike: Source, Valve has used awesome audio design, with a good quality pair of headphones, you can hear every step around you, so take advantage of it! The ability to sound ♥♥♥♥♥ is amazing when you're 1v5 clutching and you hear 3 guys to your right and 2 to your left, but can determine their distance based on sound alone, amazing. They have done it right. The original CS:S voices such as the ""Terrorists Win"" and ""Counter-Terrorists Win"" are still used in CS:GO today! Recently CSGO was updated with a new Audio Codec, making those Angry russians screaming ""♥♥♥♥♥♥BLYET"" just that little bit extra crisper and tasty. Good job Valve!Game physics 8/10Coming from the HL2 Engine, the physics in CSGO are on par! To the weapon recoil, to the boost spots, to the nade stacking skills to the casual birds flying in the sky. A few issues with pixel walking especially in the professional scene (DAMN YOU FNATIC) but I think most have been sorted and patched out :)Community 6/10Okay, so here is where i have my biggest issues. Yeah it's not the best community, but it usually depends on your rank, In Silver/Nova you're more likely to encounter toxic players who leave/troll and harrass so much that you want to literally uppercut your monitor but as you get better (and more tolerant of said individuals) and see your rank increase, you'll realize that Valve has a large hacker/cheater/smurf issue. Gaben is taking care of them in waves, but you know, how big can the waves get before you cause a Tsunami... you get me? No? Okay.. well... I'm sure they're doing something about it... sure.Overall experience: 8/10 (Amended: I found the community somewhat lacks, yet there are some awesome YouTubers that you should check out if you're interested in exploring the GOOD side of the CS:GO community. Trilluxe and Sparkles to name a couple.)It has some problems, but I'm still enjoying this game. Everyone should at least try CSGO! Updated regularly, bug fixes and such, regular tournaments, LAN events ect! New maps every other month, new skins every other WHENEVER, brilliant. Highly recommend you play this game, despite the abundance of cheaters and pro-level players getting involved with cheating, you should play this game. DON'T CHEAT THOUGH!

Hi all! Actually hard to tell something about this game. I will not talk alot about game i will talk more about community. Because lol what to say actually...ehm? Good shooter? :D This is all what i can say about like game looks like. You can say:"" Oh game looks pretty good and alot of my friends are playing in it i must to try too!"" But i must to warn you. If you are very sensetive person and testy like choleric[en.wikipedia.org] i really don't reccomend this game for you. In this moment yes this game become really worst game in the world. First of all rank system if you care about your rank -> you will care about lose or win( of cource you want to win) -> you will start to rage, insult, rude. Ask yourself please does this game cost your nerves? Does this rank cost your nerves? Just imagine libra in your mind and on one side put all bad things which happend in this game to you all bad days, games, etcetera and all good things which happend to you in this game and you will see the truth. But if you are actually not a raging person and really dont care about your rank or will you win or lose like me :) Grab your friends in there and play for FUN! There are alot of funny stuff...ehm..runboost, bhop, some tricks, lucky shots, knife/zeus trolling, etcetera... you can even just laugh with friends and play! Or if you alone just play on yourself try to make some good kills but remember no rage...Anyway i can talk here really alot of time about smurfing, cheaters, guys who  calls everybody a cheater xD, etcetera.But do we need this? I think we dont :P So actually i can't say that i recommend this game for someone this is a good game for someone the worst game ever so this is not me to decide this for you. Everybody already maked his/her choice.P.S.: I reached what i wanted and i stop to play this game. Playing really rare only for fun and only with friends.Some challenges for me:Reach a Supreme Master First Class rank - done "

If you want an actual legit game, do not ever play this online.

But a division of the community is running rampant with unfair play.Hacking and griefing.Every game you get paired against 1 or multiple cheaters. Last match, a bunch of weebs advertising their hack and dominating.6/25 Lost - Matched against 5 people spaming advertising their cheat. Everything listed below, almost no registered shots.6/25 Lost - Matched with a griefer, spawn blocking inferno T.6/24 Win - Closet Hacker on my team (still not banned)6/24 Lost - Closet Hacker (still not banned)All of June. I haven't had a legitimate match without some ""Super RAD skript kiddies"" killing any amount of fun whatsoever. Multiple of them even reasoned ""$3 accounts, who cares.""The only way to even the playing field is with a ""you can't beat em', join em"" mentality on a brand new account to indulge in 'Fun' once again while spreading malice to get them mad enough to buy the hacks to have 'Fun', and repeat in a never ending cycle.Closet hackers-No spread. *shots never spray out of a tight grouping*-ESP. Getting perfect peaks around corners, body/headshots through doors, headshots through smoke nades, perfect accuracy while blinded. (Ability to see your body through walls as if they're playing with the spectate ""X-Ray"" feature during the game)-Aimbot or Toggol Aimbot = Countering a rush killing off everybody rushing or Clutching an entire team.-Anti-Aim = Bullets do not register as hits on the player.Rage Mode Hackers-Mad spinning (RPM's that rival your cpu fan), Straight up BHOP into spawn and wreck your whole team (or enemy team if matched with you), all the while spam name changing and spam advertising the website hosting the cheating program @ ""X"" Price for ""X"" months licensing.I was Master Guardian 2 before this wave came in. Now I fell 2 ranks.Yes, ragemode hackers do get banned.No, alot of closet hackers play with esp & no-spread only and usually cannot be confirmed %100.Either ones you come across it doesn't matter because ""$3 accounts, bro.""^this whole thing could be cleaned up/worded better. ijdgaf(EDIT)12/28 - Couple months ago I made it into overwatch beta.During the downtime, when this game wasn't in the limelight (Oct) for a while, the case reviews against players actually cheating was about 1 in 7. Meaning , a full 60 minutes of watching 6 players who have been reported for playing well with no indication of cheating. Followed by 10 minutes of 1 player darting his reticle to enemy players through the walls throughout the game or the occasional asshat(s) body blocking an awping team mate, blocking a teammate into a corner, teamkilling/damaging a teammate to low health.When the holiday auction hiccup happened and people got free cs:go copies, that ratio went from 1:7 to 1:1.Every other case was like a throwaway account not even attempting to hide it, staring at the ground, spinning like crazy, bhopping throughout nuke, dust2, and mirage headshotting every player they came across.  ""Hey look at me Get♥♥♥♥♥♥on baddie $0 accounts bro."" As of late december It's 1 in 3.It's safe to say, when anything involves a flux of accounts via price or giveaway in cs:go there will be a relative flux of cheating players.			"

												OK... as you can see i spent my fair ammount of time in this game and there is reason for that (although my playtime is considered pretty average for CS:GO). It was the most competetive shooter and it had potentinal to be long lasting like CS 1.6 once was, however...DEVS screwed up. HARD.They didn't deal with the cheaters properly. Making VAC ban waves once per few months and then cheaters rebuying the game brings them money. Introducing ""new"" system that lets the player deal with cheaters so he feels in ""control"", all that just for distraction.Introdoucing s*itload of unoptimazed updates made the game lag. HARD. Your average PC was able to run it 140fps+(have in mind that FPS is one of the crytical aspects of competetive shooters), now i get 60 to 80fps. That way people end up spending more money on more powerful hardware (these steam machines gotta sell!!!).Volvo made sure to get updates that would pi$s off community and create drama, once again so they distract them from the real path the game has been taking. Example: Introdouce something that benefits volvo/devs/illuminati/hardware sellers, then cover it off by introdoucing update that would cause even more drama, so people forget about the previous one.Not just that, but having all these map changes, $hit sounds, constant cat and mouse balancing game made the entire gameplay feel less competetive than the beta.Thats just sad.Edit: Updated with more info.

												Before I started playing CSGO I was depressed and not motivated to do anything and I hated my job and didn't know what to do in my life.But this game has totally changed my mind and opened a new chapter to my life. Finally I found something that I am good and helps me to reduce stress.However, this have become an addiction and I can not STOP playing this game 24/7 and even got FIRED by my boss for being late and tired at work. But who CARES that job sucks anyways.But now I have become a potatoe and jobless and still opening cases to get a knife and hoping to get a PAYDAY $$$  :)Before I played: ＼＼ ＿ 　　 ＼( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 　　　 <　⌒ヽ 　　　/ 　 へ＼ 　　 /　　/　＼＼ 　　 ﾚ　ノ　　 ヽ_つ 　　/　/ 　 /　/| 　(　(ヽ 　|　|、＼ 　| 丿 ＼ ⌒) 　| |　　) / `ノ )　　Lﾉ After I played: ／ﾌﾌ 　　　　　　 　ム｀ヽ / ノ) 　 ()()()()() / ｜　　( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°）ノ⌒（ゝ._,ノ /　ﾉ⌒7⌒ヽーく　 ＼　／ 丶＿ ノ ｡　　 ノ､　｡|/ 　　 `ヽ `ー-'_人`ーﾉ 　　　 丶 ￣ _人'彡)			"

												*UPDATED REVIEW of MAY 2nd, 2016* Gambling in Blackjack offers a better chance in winning the jackpot than the crate system. This is what CS:GO has become. Most people, not even gamers, only see the illusion that they can win some super rare knife instead of playing the game. It was the obnoxious ""Arms Deal"" update that struck down CS:GO into a trash game and the later updates only made it worse or did nothing to improve it. Don't believe me? Since micro-transactions were introduced, floods of scamming bots sent me friend invites in attempt to trick me and for weeks, I had to reject and block them. Yes, it stopped but the damage was done. Lots of idiots could not see past their greed and lost their items and complained so much to Steam support that they implemented those Steam Market policies that punished everyone who uses the market. For the other side that do care about the game to some degree, they're just as bad too. Just about any action you do just leads to an immediate reprimand from other players to the point, why bother even playing online? Then comes to the badly handled competitive system. When I did join, I keep on having idiots on my team or a player who would not stop mic-spamming and was kicked. I had to put up with this for around one hour and nearly all the time, the incompetence from my teammates cost me of a victory. Never again. And now, that ""Co-op mode"" has bordered CS:GO to a game like Call of Duty and Battlefield. The ""Operation Missions"" were one of the earliest examples of that. They have failed to regain my interest and trust in the game. Also, the community is toxic, more toxic that an irradiated area of Chernobyl. The community hub is filled with threads at the top page that complain about getting a VAC ban, trade scam, or competitive ban around 90%. The other 10% is usually a giveaway. The community is also hostile to any sort of criticism, calling out anyone who dares to criticize their ""holy"" game as ""silvers"", ""noobs"", etc and thus become narcissistic in what they think is their own right. Guess what? I played the game long before the ""Arms Deal"" update and the community was not like this. It was a decent game and it was much, much better without nearly everyone clobbering over a virtual item. As such, you guys most likely make Minh Lee and Jess Cliffe embarassed by forgoing the true spirit of Counter-Strike. Want to prove me wrong? Then don't leave those cliche'd insults in the comments page. CS:GO should be put out of its misery one day and I suppose until that day comes, I play the older Counter-Strike games that actually gives more respect to gamers (and the modding community, regarding weapon skins and models that had more work put into them). Can't comprehend with this review? Deal with it. I have lost faith in the Steam forums anyway due to the immature nature of people here.			"

												there is no game out there that I got as much into as I got with cs:go. All started with me watching competative matches on warowl's channel. and I saw these elite players with their godlike skills and fancy new skins (the arms deal update came around). and I was like damn, I want to play like them. so I bought the game. I wasn't sucking bad because I'm a visual learner and learned most of the basics by watching the pros play. but I wanted more. I learned the spray patterns, shot a wall to learn the recoil over and over again and soon it came to the point where I surpassed all other players in casual matches with ease. the spray patterns where in my muscle memory, my reflexes with the awp improved, my nades landed where I wanted them to land and the addiction swallowed me whole. I'm going to break 1000 hours this week, I have a 300 euro inventory, a clan that get's better and better by day, a youtube channel and the best thing: endless fun. You can play gun games, awp servers, minigames, jails, hide and seeks, deathruns, aim servers, knife servers, surfs, deathmatches, demolition games and many more not considering casual and matchmaking games. And if you think you will get bored of the maps you're wrong. The maps don't create the gameplay experience, it's the players + every half a year there comes out a new operation with additional new community created maps and community created weapon skins. it costs 5 euros, but if your friend has the operation you can join his game anytime without being blocked by the game or forced to charge. CS:GO is a game that will 100 % occupy you if you're eager and competative or even if you just love community based games with a sht ton of human interactions through VoIP			"

												Counter-Strike makes you work to enjoy the content, and you'll have to put many hours of play into it before enjoying the feeling of conquering it.Weapons are a huge part of the series too, with CS:GO not an exception. Each round provides a cash sum based on your previous performance, and with this you can purchase armour, projectiles and weapons. Firearms range from standard assault rifles to shotguns and sniper rifles, and you'll want to experiment with each one to see which works best.What makes Counter-Strike such a popular series - and what will no doubt make CS:GO the next big PC shooter - is the thrill of the ego chase. As you die, often continuously, the frustration is outweighed by an aspiration to do better. In a game where success is pinned on attention to detail, death often triggers an internal failure analysis that the player will mull over while waiting for a new session to load. It becomes a spiral of egging yourself on to do better - and if you become a good player, the game becomes a stage for you to parade your skills.Global Offensive builds on the CS series by going through a significant checklist presented by its community and marking off as many points as possible. Gun game as its own separate mode? Check. Competitive capabilities built in? Check! Map balancing here and there? Check, check, check.As a result, there are numerous upgrades that will adjust gameplay while also making accessibility far better. The wide range of grenades, for example, will likely make play more tactical - laying down incendiary grenades will thwart rushes, while decoys, which fake gunfire and fool radar points, are brilliant tools for messing with the minds of established players.The actual core shooting will be a huge talking point for many months to come. It has been tinkered slightly and gives weapons a noticeably floaty feel, which doesn't sit well to begin with. We eventually found ourselves enamoured by it, and the impact of hits add a real tactile distinction to play.It's what doesn't work, however, that is most notable. Regular mode has no new maps added to it, while all the new guns seem somewhat cosmetic. Global Offensive has also removed some of its middling weapons such as the MP5, essentially pushing even more players to stick with the AK and the M4. Sometimes it gives the impression that there is in fact less valuable content than in previous CS releases.If one assumed this was Counter-Strike Source with a visual mod installed, there would often be little to shake that impression.There's also now a split between casual and competitive servers - however, many players aren't yet aware of the differences, mainly because the distinction isn't made obvious enough. It becomes even more confusing if you join a community server with all hosts of mods installed on it, which have perhaps taken casual mode, turned friendly fire on and essentially made it as close to Source as possible.At times, arranging games in Competitive Mode feels like a chore. Joining a five-on-five war is simple enough, but attempt to lobby up with a group of friends and join a game, and you'll often hit a snag. Myself and a few others tried to find a competitive game with no luck, simply being told that no servers were currently available.When you finally do join, it works fine, but the wait and work required to find a game seems like a drawback. We eventually gave up and resorted to using IRC to find matches, as we would with Source.Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not the key evolution point that we were hoping for, and the response from the community often reflects this view. On many occasions, other players used phrases such as ""same old"" to us.This is elementally Counter-Strike Source with some fine-tuning under the bonnet, and Valve appears to have acknowledged this with the reasonable RRP attached to it.And yet the core DNA of the game has not lost its appeal. This is still a glorious experience that sets a benchmark for all multiplayer shooters. Valve's objective with Global Offensive was to draw together the active communities of both the Source and trusty 1.6 edition. It clearly has a good chance.			"

												Engine still broken after idk how long. Stopped playing when the buggy as hell CSS was released try to get back into it but the registry and .netcode in this version of the game is still so awful that it's nearly unplayable. The community consists of ""die-hard try-hards"" and people who haven't the slightest clue as to what they are doing. Ranks are useless and baseless as it falls under a W/L ratio, rather than a K/D ratio like its forefather CAL. With this release Valve continues to make money off of other people's ideas with stupid things like gun skins and lacks the originality it once had with it's release of HL1 and 2. All in all this game is a huge waste of money and does not give anything to the modding community that once made this game thrive. Forgetting the average age of a gamer and turning it's back on the people that made CS a once world renouned title.			"

Overall i believe this dungeon crawler indie game should be given and 13/74. Cartons Of Lemons.			"

 A Very Competitive Tactical Multiplayer FPS+ Plenty of well designed maps+ Visually very appealing+ Very high player population with great matchmaking that will get you in a game in less than a minute at any time of the day.+ The Arms Race or ""Gun Game"" mode is a favorite of mine. Essentially every time you get a kill you upgrade to a new weapon which is a lot of fun.+ Nice selection of guns+ Great Sound Effects~  A bit too competitive. People take this game extremely seriously and spend hundreds if not thousands of hours memorizing the map and perfecting their aim. Some might love this, others may hate this aspect. - You die extremely fast in this game, and can not regain health.- Very repetitive. There isn't many game modes, and you mainly end up playing Bomb Defusal (which is basically Search & Destroy if you are more familiar with Call of Duty)- Microtransactions ""Skins"" which are very costly- I feel like Counter Strike lacks features that other shooters have. ADS (Aiming Down Site), Vehicles, Gametypes, Killstreaks, Leveling / Progression / Unlock systems, destructable environments, going prone, sliding, leaning, etc.- In competitive play, a large portion of time is spent watching others play. After you die, you must wait for the round to finish by spectating others. [keep in mind these are opinions]			"

Now there is not much to say seeing the fact that russians have taken over the game among with the skins and the gloves...Valve had one job: Improve the game.  How bad can developers fail to that? Well in this case the amount of stupidness was huge.The only thing they have done the past years was creating the prime matchmaking system. And that's it. This game has become a big dissapointment and I am not the only one who thinks that, but with Valve only giving a fudge about money it's sad.			"

												Since the dawn of time, I have lost hope in fps games and life itself generally because of milked franchises. The sky had no color, food had no flavor. After playing this truly amazing life-altering of a game, I can honestly say I'm a changed man.  CS GO has captured my imagination and took me into my unknown sub-conscious.  This game has made a profound impact to me. Never before I felt like ripping another human beings head off. Uninstalling, reinstalling became a daily routine for the millionth time because of clueless teammates and their ""cool skins"" (I guess skin > skill matters more).I feel like everyone needs to play this game at least acouple of times because the thrill of clutching, fragging, etc is unlike anything I've experienced. It takes me back to the good old CoD4/ Gears of War/ Battlefield days, having clan battles either GB or underground rules blah blah blah. A true fps that is fun for all ages! For the casual players, you can just have fun with mods and for the competitive, you will def enjoy this. From the ""your mom"" 12yr old squeakers to the maturest people. This community is toxic as you'd expect, but from the smurf and hackers, you'll either quit or keep on trying.			"

												Просто най-добрата игра, която съм играл. Има разнообразие от мапове, оръжия и тн. Феновете постоянно я поддържат като правят нови неща за играта. Също така пада много смях като се цъка с русначи, тей че взимайте. Силно я препоръчвам. Никой не е сгрешил с CS:GO до сега!			"

												Really fantastic and balanced game!And think about the competetive aspects you could compete:- Queing up vs fullpremade teams as solo!-Getting kicked out of a ladder game just for fun for having a disconnect, even if you have 10:0 stats. -If you arent familiar with russian greetings you should inform yourself before joining a game, else you would be confused about♥♥♥♥♥♥BLIAT VODKA VODKA, YOUR MOTHER IS A *BIEEEEP*!- Do you like arabians?? Better be friendly to them, because teamkilling is what they stand for.- Matchmaking is starting 4vs5 games, enjoy your bot! - People get random Matchmaking bans, because they can`t reconnect due to bugs!-You have to decide what player you are, you have 2 options. You can be the noob or the hacker. As Noob you basically have worse than 1,0 kd. As Hacker you are above 1,0kd, pretty simple, isnt it. -Oh and if you meet people who are Global Elite after 20 hours playtime, dont be afraid. Its okay. The boy/girl isjust playing on one of his 37 smurf accounts. I can really recommend this game if you live in russia and your IQ is below 70! Or you love the sound of ongoing 13 yo german gangster-rapper screaming in your ears, this game could be for you. If you arent sure yet if you should buy this, just check out some hacks in youtube which are available for cs:go. Its awesome. You see flying people who shoot with homing bullets through 10 walls while screaming in voicechat, YOU ARE ALL NOOBS, BUHAHAHAHAHAH.And honestly, who would want to miss something like that :) ?If the current bugs are taken serious by valve the game might leave beta stage in like 3-4 years.Buy it right now!

												So, where do I even start?First of all the problem is same with other valve's multiplayer games *cough Dota2 *coughInstead of fixing the game to make it more fun, they're adding more cosmetic items & more esportsWhich is clearly making more money for themThe thing is while they're making more and more money, they don't have enough supports & employees to handle our problemsSo, where did the money go to? I don't know probably more cosmeticsLet's say it like this""Hey which one do you want? New gamemode like chicken defusal mode? Less lag?New weapons, anti hacker weapon? De_Dust that more dustier than before?""""Nah, I think they want more cosmetics. Maybe tattoos? Custom underwear? Shoes?""""Hey *camera zoom in*, that's pretty good!""Do you guys prefer something like that?Surely not, right?Or maybe a report button for ""toxic"" peopleSo, toxic people play with other toxic peopleAnd let people that want fun play with each othersThe gameplay itself by any means not bad, it's very improved from cs 1.6 dayBut as always community itself is a big problemThere are people that playing only for fun, but that's really hard especially with toxic people everywhereWhat happened Valve? Where are your passion for making great games like Half-Life & Portal?Did money make you forgot about where you shine the most?I know this doesn't look like a review, more like a rantSo, I'll leave it at that. I respect valve, but I don't understand themIt's like they're ignoring us, most of the players all the timeThey clearly don't care about the state of the game right nowTL;DRIt's a fun game, but once the community is a big problem.You have to work on your anger management to stay sane, because one or two games they'll be someone blaming you or angry at youPlaying with friends probably will make your life easierP.S.Thank you for reading this review ^^If you didn't feel it's helpful, feel free to give it thumb downPlease tell me what's wrong with my review and I'll correct it			"

												Csgo is one of those games I can not stop coming back to. I have played Counter Strike from WAN id's and dial up. The CS games have always had Cheaters, Csgo more so then others. I am sad to say even though I can not get enough of this game I will not recommend it until they figure away to lock out 99% of the cheaters. DO NOT BUY unless you want to experience anger and frustration in 70% of you're games. If not more.			"

Every game you will get 4 communist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in your team who can't speak 1 single word English. The only ""fix"" for this is downloading the ""server picker"" software and choose NA servers, but you will have a latency disadvantage. So yeah, get this game if you want to either play with 4 Russian teammates every round or you want to play with high ping.			"

												Simply the cake of first-person shooters. In my head CS is the purest aim-based shooter. The Counter-Strike series are an absolute classic dating back 12 years and the recipe hasn't changed very much. Why change what is not broken, and Valve realized that and made CS: Global Offensive a modernized and community-driven version of older holy grails like CS 1.6 and CS:Source.I just had to buy this game for the sake of the good old LAN-party days and the lasting effect CS 1.6 left on me.-------------------------------------------------------------------I am very pleased with what Valve managed to do with this game. I never knew it was possible but they managed to make the game compatible with all skill levels, as opposed to something like let's say CS 1.6 in which ""Get rekt"" is the only game mode new players can play.What surprised me even more is the fact that they kept the classic feeling of older titles in this series. All you have to do is go into the game options and change your crosshair to ""Classic"" and you're set.As I expected from Valve's legendarily well-made engines, the game is running as smooth as butter on ice. The input scheme is astonishingly sharp and for good reason, since every single pixel can make the difference here.Speaking about pixels, the graphics are based on the Half-Life 2 engine and I must say, they're extremely fitting and the very, very well-made maps are the cherry on top. Nothing distracting here and definitely nothing ugly or out of place. It's a minimalist approach in my opinion and I absolutely love it! No extra filler added in, only what's needed. As a result the game is optimized as hell for high frames per second. Flawless gem polish all-around, can't really spot any imperfections.CS:GO is really balanced around the player's skill level, the player's aim and his team synergy. Match making is solid, too. There is really to complain about in this game. If you are losing it's because you suck and if you win it's because you are a mean, well-oiled clicking machine. I haven't really delved too deep into the team aspect of this game but I am really looking forward to the new ""Competitive"" matches. I will get there eventually, I just need to get even better than I am now, and maybe make some time to play more awesome games like this. Competition is not absent from this game, it's over-abundant for those who want to seek a challenge. You'll get it, for sure.The game modes are plenty as the maps. They include the classic Terrorists -- Counter-Terrorists paradigm and they revolve around the classic: Plant the bomb, Rescue the Hostages and many more new ones that are just a truck full of fun. More casual and more well-known game modes like Deathmatch and such are in the game if you want to shoot something fast.I am really surprised by the numerous and awesome community this game constructed, and it's constantly growing too. The players are really friendly and fun to play against from what I've seen. Good sportsmanship too.All in all, what it really comes down to is the fun aspect of this game, and boy, I must say after just a couple of matches I realized I was gonna skip the night just to play some good old CS. The game is fun and addictive once you get into it. Rounds may be short, but the replayability is ridiculously good, and it scales well with the multiplayer aspect. Man those headshots are satisfying to land.-------------------------------------------------------------------Some tips I gave to a friend, and I'm sure these will be useful for newer players out there:""In CS, basically you have to click on the enemies head before they do, while your crosshair is minimized. Don't shoot unless you have a guaranteed headshot.For starters, I recommend switchingto one of the dynamic crosshairs in the option menu.I use classic dynamic. Now you have an idea where bullets are going. Try shooting bullets at a wall and see where they hit. Try full auto, try burst. Try practice mode here, without bots.In 98% of the situations it's good to burst or semi shoot. Never go full auto, controlling recoil is essential. You must wait a bit until your crosshair is small before shooting. Don''t forget to use Crouch/Walk (Ctrl/Shift) to minimize your crosshair. For beginners, try crouching when you see a guy and try clicking on his head. Also, never shoot while moving, your rekoil is huge and you don't have chances to hit.Don't forget to put your crosshair at head level always. Keep it up and close to corners. When enemy comes by you only have to move an inch for a headshot.Play deathmatch at first to train.What matters, in order:1) AimAll weapons are hitscan. Aim well and use low sensitivity + a huge mouse pad. I go 28 cms per 360 degrees.2) ReflexesYou have to aim accurately and you also have to be fast in doing so. No point being able to click on the enemies head if he clicks on yours first.3) Map awareness and predictive thinkingThis is basically your game skill that you've gathered through experience. Knowing how to be effective on the map. Knowing where enemies are. Listening for enemies. Knowing to take cover. Knowing when to engage. Knowing to stay with teammates. Knowing where to throw grenades.""-------------------------------------------------------------------Overall, this game is absolutely great. Can't really point anything wrong with it and I'm really looking forward to spend hundreds of hours on this one in the long run.Maybe I'll uncover some things wrong with it after I play it more, and I'll surely update this guide.Buy it.Especially if:-it's on sale-you like FPS's, especially if you've played and loved the classic ones like CS 1.6, Quake and such-you have good aim-you like a challenge and you have a competitive nature-------------------------------------------------------------------~~~ 9/10 ~~~A sacred beast of a game.-------------------------------------------------------------------""Counter-Strike is a pretty simple game. All you have to do is click on their heads"" ~ Anonymous			"

												I will never recommend or possibly play this game again. Too much drama has been poured into this game, that it is sickening. We have devolved to a state of madness which has eternally damned us in the name of CS:GO. First it was the ridiculous overwatch system, which in itself was not a bad idea. However, when looked at on paper, the abuse potential is amazingly high. Then it was Competative mode, the worst thing to ever happen to counterstrike. Then there was the skin gambling scandal. I would rather have cheaters and griefers in CS:GO than have riciculous overwatch bans and griefer bans.  The update on 10/25/2016 they took tooo far. CS:GO had always been a grey topic for me, but now I publically denounced CS:GO and anyone who is a dev, mod, or manager of it. You sold your souls to this? Are you happy players? Is this what you wanted? 'This game' is a disgrace to what counterstrike is supposed to be about. CS:GO devs, you have committed what is unforgivable. Let's just hope this embarrasment of a game is forgotten in 2022. I have never been VAC, Overwatched, or game-banned. I am a normal player who is easily bored, but when tyrants take over games; I cannot remain silent. CS:GO has gone from bad to worse. Save yourself some money and buy CS:S

												CS:GO (Chicken Seeker: Guaranteed Offbase) is a game where you seek your lost chickens so that you can return to your farm. Using different mechanics to scare your chickens and herd them to different points on the map (Point A and Point B) is the objective of the game, you'll find that it's both fun and challenging to get your chickens there safely. Unfortunately, the multiplayer aspect of this game is full of people who find it fun to disrupt your game. It's almost impossible to spawn into the game without getting griefed by your fellow players, they will try their very best to kill both you and your chickens. The game itself is unmoderated and this behavior seems to go unpunished, the makers of the game seem to think this behavior is funny and have indulged the joke by coding the bots to grief in much the same way. Until this very serious problem is addressed I will have to give this a thumbs down. Only buy this game if you enjoy not being able to play your game due to a toxic community and incompetent developers who think such behavior is funny.			"

												This game has a crazy in-depth story line with insanely insightful philosophy into the terrorism battle that is haunting the United States. This game is all about terrorists vs. counter - terrorists and it makes you see both sides of the story and how sometimes the terrorists just need a little bit of love. This game really unveils the whole ""Bush did 9/11"" conspiracy and proves how steel beams can be destroyed by bombs. In fact, anything can be destroyed by bombs. That is why terrorists have an inert advantage when it comes to tactical warfare; however, the counter - terrorists have many tools themselves, such as powerful guns and the powers to defuse the bombs that the terrorists plant. All in all, I would have to say this game is pretty interesting in the whole terrorism fiasco that America is going through right now and is definitely insightful into many things concerning Osama bin Laden and whether the fact that Obama is black or an alien. No one really knows, I personally think he is half black half martian.			"

												CS:GO is arguably the best Counter-Strike in the series. Counter-Strike's unique style in the first person shooter genre has made this series a trail blazer among many other shooters. CS:GO carries this mantra and revitalizes the concept with content that is mainly user driven. Compared to the previous iteration, some weapons have been replaced with similar counterparts while the maps have been upgraded and balanced more appropriately. Admittedly, the game was riddled with issues during the early stages but it has matured drastically since its inception, owing to Valve's diligence and community feedback. CS:GO's 250,000 concurrent players and the ever expanding competitive scene stands testimony to this game's successful approach. At the heart of this game is the community's boundless imagination full of custom maps, skins, stickers, and soundtracks that add style to the gameplay. Additionally, to show appreciation to the community, Valve packages community content into DLC and uses it to support the content creators and fund the competitive scene. This game is a must have for the FPS fans.			"

												I loved the game until the winter update, It has made this game more rng based after the rifle patch.  I dont even have to explain what the r8 has done to the game.  I was a good supporter of csgo for a long time until the 2015 winter update.  I will not be playing this game until what they have done is reversed.			"

												HeyIf you have a life.. then don't buy this game.It will F up ur life. I'm warning you now.Back away760 hours within like 3 months...I need help. This game takes ur money with ur addition to buying cases and making a -2.00 dollar profit. Your only friends will be the friends you meet in a casual game. Your family will think you have died.Your voice will get lost from raging too much.You won't have a computer after you punch it. You don't need to take a language class when you got csgo.If you thought little kids are cute.. Then meet one in a csgo game. If your a girl prepared for stalker guys coming to hunt u down. ;)And you will learn that ur a hacker just because you get a head shot....basically you will die.Good luck69/10 would die again for this game.

												You want a good, tightly balanced, classic online PvP shooter. You're prepared to deal with idiocy, extremely childish behaviour, herd insinct, insults, harassment, copious amounts of griefing, high-pitched teenager voices bossing you around and boasting about intercourse with your mother. You realize the team is just an excuse to boost your ego if you're carrying it or to boost your rank if you're getting carried, as actual teamwork is a rather foreign concept to this game. You're already fed up with CoD. Also you are male, or willing to pretend. Go crazy, this is just the game for you.If on the other hand, you're looking for fruitful teamplay, if you expect adult-like behaviour, a respectfully competitive environment that gives you a chance to learn and improve, communication with deeper vocabulary than ""gg ez rekt"" and ""♥♥♥♥♥ur mom"", in other words, anything that won't give you the feeling you somehow ended up in an elementary school recess... then fly, you fool. There's nothing in this for you but salt. Very bitter salt. Find better things to do with your time and money. Support innovative game concepts for example, instead of encouraging Valve to keep milking a franchise whose core gameplay hasn't evolved in a decade. Give your support to independent studios instead of paying to play cops and robbers with licensed gun designs that benefit arms manufacturers.tl;dr: the game is alright/mediocre. The community is horrible. Carry on your merry way, don't waste your sanity. Smiley out.			"

												I simply can't recommend this game to anyone in the sad state that it's in. The developers at Valve don't pay attention or care about the effect of the changes they make. The skill ceiling is getting lower with each passing update, and the most recent one is just plain insulting. An obviously broken revolver that anyone with over 10 hours could see is overpowered still managed to make it through QC, along with an unnecessary nerf to spraying. There's no transparency or communication with the community from Valve. If you care about competition at all, this game isn't for you until the developers get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together.			"

												As much as I love the game, I simply cannot recommend it at it's current state.My first matches on CS:GO were fun, the community was nice. The game was great, just like CS:S, but this was back in 2013. Now, in 2016, CS:GO is a very toxic community. Most players overreact to small things that happen during competitive play, and I would understand if this was a high ranking match, but I'm ranked at Silver 1, and I've met people who honestly act like they're in global.And don't forget to mention the thousands of kids who only really care about the skins in this game.  I enjoy trading and getting expensive things in CS:GO, but these kids will buy 30-40 dollar knives, and brag about them in casual or competitive matches.And finally, Valve itself makes me not want to recommend the game. Most updates are just minor graphical changes, or changes to the audio. But when they do update gameplay (Either changing how a gun works or adding a new one) they're usually broken in some way.  A great example would be the R8 Revolver update, pre-nerf the Revolver was just as good as an AWP, even better if you ask me.  But now, Valve nerfed it so much that it's pretty much useless unless you've practiced an extensive amount of time with it.Overall, CS:GO is a great game thats plagued by it's horrible community and bad updates. If by any chance the game and community gets better, I will rewrite my review and recommend it. But for now, I just cannot bring myself to recommend the game. "

												""omg are you a grill""Gas-fueled grills typically use propane (LP) or natural gas (NG) as their fuel source, with gas-flame either cooking food directly or heating grilling elements which in turn radiate the heat necessary to cook food. Gas grills are available in sizes ranging from small, single steak grills up to large, industrial sized restaurant grills which are able to cook enough meat to feed a hundred or more people. Gas grills are designed for either LP or NG, although it's possible to convert a grill from one gas source to another.The majority of gas grills follow the cart grill design concept: the grill unit itself is attached to a wheeled frame that holds the fuel tank. The wheeled frame may also support side tables and other features.A recent trend in gas grills is for manufacturers to add an infrared radiant burner to the back of the grill enclosure. This radiant burner provides an even heat across the burner and is intended for use with a horizontal rotisserie. A meat item (whole chicken, beef roast, pork loin roast) is placed on a metal skewer that is rotated by an electric motor. Smaller cuts of meat can be grilled in this manner using a round metal basket that slips over the metal skewer.Another type of gas grill gaining popularity is called a flattop grill. According to Hearth and Home magazine, flattop grills ""on which food cooks on a griddlelike surface and is not exposed to an open flame at all"" is an emerging trend in the outdoor grilling market.A small metal ""smoker box"" containing wood chips may be used on a gas grill to give a smoky flavor to the grilled foods. Although, barbecue purists would argue that to get a true smoky flavor (and smoke ring) the user has to cook low and slow, indirectly and using wood or charcoal. Gas grills are difficult to maintain at the low temperatures required (~225-250 °F), especially for extended periods.i also enjoy the spra-oh 50 uses?			"

												If you are depressed, do not play this game due to the toxic nature of the community and the learning curve.

												I ignored this game for so long hoping it would get better but it hasn't. It shockingly got even worse.Tl;DR - Toxic community full of cheaters and micro transactions.Before I start lets get into the history of Counter Strike. The Original CS was a fun competitive game that still remains superior to it's sequel, CS:source. CS:source was popular mainly because of the large amounts of custom maps that were flooded into the game but killed competitive CS and turned the game into a casual shooter.Then CS:GO came.  This game was made solely for micro transactions, but to be honest any game made by valve will be from now on. But the game has no major changes from cs:source other than skins and cosmetics. Furthermore these weapon skins and cosmetics feel like something that fits more in tf2. Bright pink guns and meme stickers make me want to vomit. But hey, if you want to spend $300 on a knife skin that you will never use or get a kill on be my guest. Another problem are the guns. None of them are balanced in the game. Most famous one being the awp, the 1 shot 1 kill weapon. And last we have the matchmaking. It is some of the worst matchmaking I have ever seen. Any game where it takes over 5min. to get into a match fails, and cs:go has no excuse seeing as how as of this review it is the second most played game on steam.And lastly the main reason I hate this game, is the community. So I was on a server, everyone was dead. It was me vs. the entire other team and as you would guess, I died. Then some squeaker yells over the mic ""what the f#ck you idiot!"" and starts a vote kick on me that passed. The other way around happened where I hid in a corner no one checked and shot the entire enemy team and won and I get ""You f#cking hacker!"" and get kicked.This stuff is normal when you play this game because 75% of everyone playing it is some annoying kid with some kind of meme name. On top of that this game is full of Russians that like to yell. A lot. Now you would think that when you play on a west coast server Russians wouldn't join because bad ping, but they do. And then you would KNOW Russians wouldn't join on an east coast server because it is on the other side of the world and they would get the worst possible ping, but they still do. It's almost as if they are only joining these games so they can yell at people and not play the game at all. 30% of all the nearby servers, at least where I live, are idle servers and even then there aren't that many servers to begin with and it confuses me because this game has pretty much the same amount of servers as tf2 even though there are a lot more people who play this, at least to what steam says in their stats. And lastly this game is full of cheaters. And having a ranking system where you get better ranks depending on your k/d ratio will always make more dumb kids want to cheat. And having next to no defenses against kids cheating because you can almost never confirm if this kid is hacking or just lucky because you pretty much instantly die if you get shot in the head with any weapon.This game it is best used just to idle for the chance of getting a drop you can sell for 30$. With that said I'm done. I would like to remind anyone reading this that this is my opinion of the game and everyone has different opinions. And yes, ik, my opinion is shít and i'm an under-aged-pleb that clearly knows nothing about video games. No need to sprinkle your salt in the comments.			"

												Played a lot 1.6 , so playing csgo is in a lot of ways better.Normal games are fun to play if you compare it with ranked.Ranked is most of the time very frustrated and have nothing to do with skills alone.It all depends on what for team you get , it's that simple.That whole team selection you have / use is totally broking.Most of the times all bad players are put in the same team.Playing bad don't matter we all have bad days , but give atleast 1 or 2 normal players.You can't know how somebody is feeling and that depends on how he is playing, true.But after some ranked matches it's not hard to see that it's totally unbalenced.Playing ranked should be more fun then normal but it's not , and thats really ♥♥♥♥ed up.Bad players , having a bad day , or when nothing works - it happens.Win / loose , a good score or a bad one - it's part of the game.But most frustrating thing is cheaters in ranked.Most players that use cheats don't use it in normal games , 9 out 10 times only in ranked.Why? because when you use steam and try to search them to make a report , you can't.In normal games you have 2 options , search players you have played against and are playing now.In ranked games you only have the option the players you have played against.They use cheats , win the match , change name or avater and then it's impossible to find them.The options you have in ranked to make it more real is also not working.Team attacks , if you know your game a little then you know this happens all the time.A wrong shot or reflex or what ever can always happen.Attacking a teammate just out frustration happens all the time.Have seen ranked matches were my or the oposit team hit and kill each other all the time.You can make 2/3/4 kills before you get punished for it and get throw out of the game.You can hit your teammate every round 1/2 times and nothing happens.If you say something about it then the chance you get kicked is high.If you have some rules for auto kick then why you allow us to kick in ranked?When you are afk you get kicked , when you keep killing teammates you get kicked.The things people should kicked for are autmomatisch , so why the option?You can stand nr.1 in your team with by far the best score but can get kicked if you make 1 mistake.Most people will vote somebody off not out of logic but because of there own frustrations they have.Kicking in normal games who cares , but get kicked in ranked is a totally different story.The option for surrender in ranked is also very frustrated.If you play against someone with wallhack then it's annoying but he can die.Playing against somebody with aim is pointless and nothing more then a waste of time.Then we have to keep playing when the chance of victory is 0%.You can't surrender unless somebody of your team have left the game or is voted off.So when somebody plays with aim and leave the ranked match then not the cheater is punisched but the normal player.You get a ban of what? 7 days not ranked.I understand you can't leave a ranked  match and that should always be punished but you have cheaters in ranked.So .. what can we do? waste about 30/60 frustrated minutes.Cs / csgo is one of the most populair games of all times on the pc.But it's also a old game and because of that i have no idea why you don't have fixed these obvious problems.It really ♥♥♥♥s up the game and you just don't do♥♥♥♥♥♥about it.You are not protecting the players you should protect , and the options u use are not working.This is not just my opinion because when you think about it it's nothing more then simple logic.If you system to make teams in ranks fails and can't fix it then you make the teams bigger.If people abuse the kicking rules in ranked then you remove that option and do a better job in auto kicks.When you can't do anything to block cheaters then the least you can do is making a option to report them.There are so many ways you can make it better and improof it.Not because you can but because you should.My options are maybe not the key but do atleast something about it.It's a great and i can also say a legend game.I like the game and always will like it and i also will keep playing it.But i will vote it down because the mess you have created is destroying a big part of the game.

												I put a lot of time into this game and I got pretty decent at it, but it got to a point where victories were no longer satisfying and losses were usually the results of really salty teammates or smurfing/scripting enemies. I have over 300 hours and I paid $15 for the game, so I no doubt got my money's worth, but half of it wasn't even enjoyable. It really comes down to what kind of matches you get put in, but I think you'll find yourself getting annoyed with the game more than enjoying it past a certain point.			"

												Broken match making system. I don't want to be matched with people who a) don't speak English, b) doesn't know how to play as a team (e.g. won't rush, won't follow orders, won't hold a position as CT, won't play time, doesn't eco). Every second game I get matched with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who can't play the game at all who rushes to their death getting maybe one or two kills and then boasts about them carrying the team when in reality they are the cause that we're all dying since nobody is holding their positions.I believe these issues can easily be solved through a speech recognition test where you're asked to repeat a few sentences for every language you want to approve for, then when people are matchmaking, they can select which language players they want to match with. Other than that, there needs to be some mechanism to support playing as a team, e.g. some detection mechanism to check if people are ecoing when their teammates are, and so forth, and then queue up toxic people with other toxic people and so forth till they fully understand and improve to get out of the hellhole.

												Sorry to say this but CS:GO right now is not realy worth playing, at least not for ranking. All these updates have destroyed the game.-Full of Cheaters-Bad Developing-[Not realy much attention from the developers given anyway]-The MM(match making) is terrible-The servers are terrible-Truly unbalanced weapons and maps-Very bad community-This game is no fun at all-After reaching global elite rank there is rly nothing else to do. There is no competition between global elites with points or something. (To know in which level your skill is compared with other GEs).-Lastly nowdays the game is based mostly on luck rather than tactical skill.Generaly the game was way better at the launch version. Well there were some ''good'' changes as well but generaly cs go has a realy realy realy bad development through the years.It used to be my favourite game, but nodays I'm bored to even play one game.Very dissapointed			"

Make the Ravioli dough.- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest - Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!

												Being one of the most popular first-person shooters Valve has to offer, Global Offensive has proven to be a major improvement in the Counter-Strike series. Its action is fast paced, requiring players to have quick and precise reactions, and team-work couldn't be any bigger in overcoming the opposing team presented in classic gamemodes.The game weapons, models and maps all take setting in terrorism and counter-terrorism. Graphics are refined and the game isn't very demanding in resources, compared to other first person shooters released in 2012.Weapon handling is a bit weird. Firing a weapon in full-auto mode yields patterns, so memorizing it would greatly improve accuracy. It encourages such spraying which wouldn't be ideal in real-life scenarios. Health isn't regenerable, nor is it replaceable, meaning every single health point counts.Since med kits aren't implemented, the next best thing is a defuse kit. It cuts down defusal time for armed bombs in half; 5 seconds. Respectively, rescue kits work similarly for tied-up hostages. Speed is a bit different for that case. Bunny hopping is and has always been a thing in Source games, CS:GO being no exception. It increases velocity of the player, making them quicker than those who simply run if done correctly. These are features that wouldn't fit players who prefer simulators over fun. Sorry to bum you out.With a new gamemodes added, it is easy to get lost in them. In short, they are modified versions of the classic gamemodes, with the exception of Deathmatch. What's nifty is that the community workshop has allowed players to push boundaries outside vanilla. Valve even encourages such creativity, with the addition of the ""Custom"" tab in game selection.Competitive has shown a way of affecting the players and their play style. The players seem to favor bomb defusal maps over hostage rescue maps with the level of competition between two selected teams proving to be very big, and while the level of competition can be fun, it isn't uncommon for that to escape.Abusing the chats (both voice and text) is often-occurring in gameplay, which usually stirs up bad etiquette. Foul play continues to be a major issue that poisons the gameplay to this day. Whether it is as major as hacking or just as disruptive as greifing, Valve's official competitive matches are constantly questioned as the best choice in competition.The work put in to counter-act these things only do so much. Overwatch in CS:GO[blog.counter-strike.net] has people review Source demos to judge the situations given to them. Specifically, they fill a checklist regarding any suspect after reviewing evidence, which can conclude if they are doing such foul play.Prime Matchmaking is another act by Valve, which has the players insert their phone number. This was to make sure VAC bans are more severe, and to have Prime Accounts group up in matchmaking. If a Prime Account was VAC banned, all accounts that use the number in the future will be ineligible for Prime Matchmaking. Only one account can use the number at a time, so be careful and choose one account you want to have do Prime Matchmaking. Of course, you have the option to prioritize Prime Matches, instead of strictly competing in these matches.Even so, this unfair gameplay has gotten so wide-spread in matchmaking. It goes up to the point where falsely accusing one person of cheating occurs every now and then, being another fuel for saltiness. Smurfing also ruins gameplay for others. Playing on ranks set for those of lower skill levels than you disrupts the fun for many. It's a thing that gets overlooked, leaving smurfs to further damage gameplay.Overall, the game has shown to be a game-changer in the series. But because the community has shown to cause trouble, Valve would either sacrifice enforcing a good community or improving mechanics on a game that is good the way it is.			"

												Over 600 hours on CS:GO. Over 13 years playing CS in general. In older versions of CS if you are high skilled you can easily take down 5 low skilled players. In this version you are lucky to get onto the 3rd guy.Game is all about luck, not skill based like all previous versions of the game. Ranked up to DMG with over 200 wins in competetive and i can say this game should be released as a 5 person COOP. You should only play comp when you have 4 other friends who you know won't troll you, regardless of their skill level its better to have that than random teammates.The hit reg in this game is absolutely nothing compared to previous versions, due to the low bandwidth allocated to the gaming servers setup by valve.The skin system is nothing but a huge money grabbing scheme which no doubt has earnt a huge amount more than the game sales alone. As with all games you can trade in, this one is full of scammers. Constantly, daily trying to scam your high value items from you. Procede with extreme caution when making trades with anyone you don't know. This game promotes gambling to under 18s with the skin drop system, costing each skin a certain price with a possible return on investment. Gambling sites are regulated and usually offer around 85% return on your gambling in the long run. I believe there is no regulation of this system and there's plenty of 12yr old kids out there throwing away hundreds into this system.Alot of reviews have complained about cheaters. This isn't such a bad problem nowa days as the overwatch system has taken over VAC in the competetive section of the game, blatent cheaters are caught and banned for 1 year quite quickly and the players that support and judge in this system are to thank.Overall the game it's self has a great system but just isn't being used to its full potential. Allocate more time and money please valve. Rating VS previous versions: 3/10Rating VS other FPS games: 8/10Community Rating: 3/10Price rating: 3/10 (Even on sale. This should be F2P with a subscription to comp games with VIP benefits)			"

												I've held this view of CSGO for quite some time, but have never found the time or motivation to publish my thoughts. I've been playing CS for many, many years - starting in the early 2000's through to present day. This time has seen me enjoy the game as a causual scrubber camping hostages, enjoying leveling my character in WC3 mods, smashing heads in deathmatch, surfing backwards, long-jumping, bhopping, played in quals for WCG, competed in CEVO and flew to different locations to compete competitively with my team in different tournaments. I've enjoyed CS from 1.1 to 1.6, CZ, CSS and also CSGO. No, this does not make me a better player than you, and no this does not mean I know everything, it simply means that I have spent a lot of time playing different titles of Counter-Strike, have played competitively and have experienced the good and the bad aspects of different releases.There are a handful of things that really upset me with CSGO, and they upset me more so because these issues still exist two years after I have first played the game. These issues I consider to be game-breaking bugs that make it such a waste of time to play. I enjoy CS because there is a skill curve: if you want to be the best at the game, you simply need to practice and spend more time learning the mechanics of the game than your opponent - This was certainly true in all other CS games I have played, but not CSGO. CSGO feels like it is a game of luck and chance.As the game stands, it is fun to play casually but anything competitively or MM is hampered by issues surrounding core aspects of the game.Hitboxes are not lag-compensated to follow the model of a player when jumpingHitboxes are not lag-compensated to follow the model of a player when crouchingHitboxes do not follow the animation of a player planting the bombAimpunch phyiscally affects recoil and is not lag-compensatedIf you are on > 70ms ping in a 64tick Server, this is how most events will play out:You see an enemy jump, you shoot the enemy and get no hits.You see an enemy continuing to jump peak a spot, you have to time your shoots to shoot where his head is going to be on the next cycle. You shoot thin air, blood appears and you get a headshot killYou see an enemy standing there, you shoot his chest, you get no hit and then he crouches instantly.You see an enemy standing there, you shoot his abdomen and get a headshot (because he was crouching on the server)You see an enemy, shoot first, die and get no hits. Watch the demo back and apparently how it played out was that he shot you first and your player aimpunched and the bullet actually hit the roof.You are hiding in a bombsite and see an enemy planting the bomb. You crouch and take your time and shoot his head 12 times, slowly one by one. You get no hits and die.All of these aspects of the game I consider EXTREMELY game-breaking. The fact that most people reading this will stop and think to themselves, ""Yeah, that has happened to me on a number of occasions"" just goes to show that the game is fundamentally flawed. In it's current state, the game rewards people for NOT AIMING - aka, ""good"" players in the game need only aim at the ground, run and shoot and they'll likely get a headshot, because as long as you don't aim AT the model that you see, there is a high likelihood that the server will decide you should have got a hit. The only one of these bugs that existed in Counter-Strike Source (pre-2010 OB update) was the hitboxes on the planting animation.An example of a bug that I do not consider game-breaking, but extremely frustrating, is the spectator glitch where you are not able to spec another player. For some reason, after the last update this bug was introduced and it has now been 3 weeks and there is still no patch or fix for this? A feature so important to the game such as being able to spectate your team has been inadvertently broken, and after 3 weeks there has still been no patch? That is a huge disappointment.People standing outside a smoke will be full view to others with no smoke obscuring them, but the player's screen will be completely black. This was an unintentional meta-change when trying to fix one-way smokes, and this new issue has existed for months now? The game has been changed so much due to this introduction such that people holding a site need only throw a smoke at the choke and will get an infinite advantage as anyone pushing through will have seconds delay before they are ever able to see the people that can see them. Throw a smoke down, wait until it starts to fade, teammate resmokes - rinse, repeat and run down the timer. Retaking a site with anything other than a horrid oponent who can't capitalise on the blind-criple wandering through the smoke is now completely impossible. What a horrible meta change. Why has this not been addressed this was introduced some months ago?3D sound is non-existent in CSGO. It is not possible to tell whether someone is running above or below you, and more often than not difficult to determine whether someone is approaching from the front or behind.This game has so many core issues wrong with it that completely changes the outcome of the game that it is not funny. I find it extraordinary that so many people are able to accept this game with all these issues, and there are few posts on this reddit about these problems. I see many threads upvoted to the top of terrorists hugging each other, but hardly any threads of people discussing the pressing issues which desperately requires patching to make the game both playable and enjoyable.It'd be nice if people were able to draw the dev's attention to these issues and press for a resolution.

												If you join a pub server and scroll through the players you'll probably find at least one more or less blatant waller, and you can rest assured VAC isn't going to detect their tutorial copy paste cheats any time soon. You know it's bad when there's an actual business around providing a 3rd party matchmaking system where people don't cheat their ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off so much so that there's more than one competing platform. You pay less money for guns that are more accurate while running than the main rifles. Acceleration feels faster than in 1.6 or source. No one gets slowed down after landing from a jump like in the older versions so they can just House of Pain it up while spamming a pistol and probably headshot you or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ Some of those are one bullet kills through helmet now, not just the deagle.Valve forced the pro scene to lengthen their bomb timer because they wanted matchmaking to be under the same rules but thought 35 seconds would be too hard for matchmaking. Literally what the ♥♥♥♥. Valve banned coaches from talking to their teams during live rounds because they feel like it's unfair because people in matchmaking don't have coaches I guess. This tells me they're not afraid to adjust their rulesets and balance their games to the lower tiers of play instead of higher.I also heard you like paying for sprays. Literally every single time you press the button. Free in earlier installments, now your spray stencils have charges and the item vanishes once you hit zero.I can't recommend this game to anyone. Don't even bother.			"

												Good:+ Solid competitive FPS with lots of teamwork and strategy+ Only popular PC game that isn't MOBA garbageBad:- Full of tryhards and constant♥♥♥♥♥♥talking. Too many people play this game just to rank up and are incapable of having fun.- Lots of hackers which Valve does a poor job fighting. The worst part is, the prevalance of hackers in this game gives everyone ""hacker-paranoia"" so if you get a few lucky shots you probably end up getting reported.- The competitive ranking system sucks as it doesn't take personal performance (only team performance) into account. A person's rank is a poor indicator of their skill level because many bad players get ""boosted"" and many good players get stuck at lower ranks by repeatedly getting matched with idiots. It feels like most competitive matches pit you against either terrible players or ridiculously good players (smurfs/hackers), and whether you win or lose is luck of the draw rather than skill.- Knowing the map layout is too crucial to winning. If you don't memorize all the bizarre callouts, and know the map layout like the back of your hand, people will think you are an idiot. The result of this is that many people end up only playing Dust 2 to avoid having to spend hundreds of hours learning map layouts.- It's made in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Source engine, which is 12 years old, which also happens to be the average age of people who play this game.It's not a bad game but it doesn't deserve it's massive popularity. Valve has become totally complacent because they make more money off virtual skins in this game in a month than they ever made off actually making good games.			"

												Counter Strike: Global Offensive is one of those games that is kind of hard not to recommend. It's a solid shooter and it is cheap and looks really good for a game that runs on the Source engine. To new players CSGO may feel a little ""back to the basics"" as this game does not have aiming down the sight, unlocks, attachments, perks and killstreaks so it's heavily based on player skill and not on selecting the perfect loadout with the perfect perks. This game does have a ranking system but it's different from all the other shooters which I'll explain later on. But the game does show a lot of depth as you play more and you will find out that not everything is as straight forward as it might have looked. It's also a tactical teamplay based shooter, so don't even think about buying it if you don't like teamplay. Only a good team can lead you to victory, not a highly skilled lone wolf.CSGO offers a small variety of game modes, those are: Deathmatch, Arms race, Demolition, Classic casual and Classic competitive. For those of you who are familiar with COD Arms race is called Gun game in COD. You start off with a weapon and every time you kill someone you'll advance to the next weapon until you get a golden knife, kill someone with the golden knife and you win the game. What's rather interesting about Arms race is that you still play in teams 5v5 but the one who killed enemies with all weapons wins. Demolition is a combination between Classic (I’ll explain classic later in the review) and arms race. The goal is to plant the bomb as a terrorist or defend the bombsites as a counter terrorist or defuse the bomb if its planted, there are no respawns and instead of buying a weapon you start with one and advance to the next weapon if you made any kills during the last round and if you made more than one kill you'll get extra rewards like frag grenades and flash bangs. In my opinion those game modes are fun but unnecessary because I never really feel the need to play them.There's also deathmatch which is a little different from the usual (team)deathmatch. It's played 5V5 and all weapons are available except for grenades. you play in a team but it's every man for himself as the person with the most points at the end of a round wins. What's also interesting about Deathmatch is that different weapons give a different amount of points and at some point during deathmatch certain weapons give bonus points. In my opinion deathmatch shouldn't be taken to serious, It's a good gamemode to improve your aim, and I know most new players will jump right into deathmatch but that's in my opinion not the way Counter Strike is supposed to be played.So that leaves Classic casual and Classic competitive which are almost the same gamemodes, therefore I’ll use this section to talk about the things these gamemodes have in common and in the next section the differences between these gamemodes. Classic consists of the two original Counter Strike game modes: defuse mission and hostage mission. In hostage mission the counter terrorists have to kill all the terrorists or rescue one of the hostages (in the other counter strike games all the hostages have to be rescued) and the terrorists have to prevent the counter terrorists from rescuing the hostages by killing all of the counter terrorists. In defuse mission the terrorists have to plan a bomb at one of the two bombsites and make it explode or kill all the counter terrorists and the counter terrorists have to win by killing all the terrorists or by defusing the bomb if it's planted in which case killing all the terrorists does not result in victory. Both defusal mission and hostage mission have a money system. You'll receive money for all sorts of things, playing a round, of course the winning team receives more in most cases, completing a part of the objective like taking a hostage or planting the bomb and kills. The kill reward depends on the weapon, a rifle or pistol will give you 1× kill reward while an SMG (except for P90) gives you 2× kill reward, a shotgun gives 3× kill reward and a knife gives 5× kill reward while the AWP gives only 0,5× kill reward. At the start of a new round you can buy weapons and grenades with the money you earned and the money you don't spend will carry over to the next round.So now the differences between casual and competitive. In casual you play either terrorist or counter terrorist and the best team out of 15 rounds wins, in competitive the teams are swapt after the 15th round and the best team out of 30 rounds wins. In casual you'll receive more money if you lose a round, less if you win a round and the kill reward for a rifle is 150 bucks while a kill with a rifle in competitive rewards 300, the developer did it this way to balance the difference in money between the good and bad team and the good and bad players in casual. Competitive is played 5V5 and casual can be played 10V10. In competitive you have to buy your armor and your defuse kit while you get those for free in casual. In casual you can just drop in a round and leave whenever you desire while in competitive you join at the start of a game and you're not supposed to leave until the game is finished, because if you do you'll get a penalty in the form of a temporary competitive ban ranging between half an hour and 7 days and I've seen screenshots of people getting over 200 days competitive cooldown. This is both fair and unfair as it will punish the players who ragequit, the more they ragequit the longer the cooldown, but sometimes you can lose connection to the server because of server problems or internet problems in which case you'll also receive a cooldown which is highly unfair. If you play casual you'll play with random people while competitive has a ranking system based on your skill and win/lose ratio and you'll play with people of the same skill level as you.There's also a community server browser with servers that have different game rules, use community maps or even have completely different game modes. I don't spend a lot of time on community servers so I can't tell you more than this.In my opinion competitive is the way to play CSGO, I spend by far most of my time playing competitive. Casual is great for practice but keep in mind that people play different on competitive. If you're new though I advice to play a few rounds on casual before playing competitive so you can learn how the gamemode works, how the economy system works and gain some map knowledge, why should you do this in casual? Well competitive is way more serious. There's also an option to play against bots if you're new to shooters but even expert bots are pretty easy to defeat and play really different than human players.The only negative points I can come up with is that the servers have to be improved as hit detection doesn't always works as it is supposed to work, and the ranking system has to be improved. At the time of writing I am silver elite master (fifth rank) but some silver elites (fourth rank) are way better than me and some golden nova 2 players (seventh rank) are much worse. And they could crank up the difficulty of the bots as medium bots in CS:S are way harder than expert bots in CSGO making bot practice less useful.Over the last year this has definitely become my favorite shooter, I even watch CSGO E-sport. It's a crown jewel and it only costs 14 bucks. I give CSGO a 10/10. This doesn't mean the game is perfect, of course it can be improved but it's based on the fun factor, and even though I sometimes HATE this game out of pure frustration, I'll always come back to it and there are barely any games out there that can do that. Everyone who remotely likes shooters should buy it.			"

												CS: GO makes my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tingle with pain. When I get a headshot I wince with a burning sensation in my testicles. I realized this game is not healthy to play, one reason being I recently installed a rop hanging from my ceiling just incase i get demoted to silver elite. My mom does not approve. Everytime I get killed I cut a little slit in my arm to hopefully teach me not to die. It has not been working and I have gone into a deep depression. I do not recemmend purchasing this game that infects you with a spite to kill yourself and other, and that creates a void that only gets filled from winning matches and getting promoted. But makes an even bigger void when you get demoted and lose. Please dont buy this game if you want a happy life free of suicidal thoughts.			"

												Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a tactical competitive first person shooter.  Aspect Review   Gameplay The competitive game mode is the main grasp of the game for me. It features close to endless enjoyment and always offers a different experience each time. The game is heavily skill based, and will require some time and effort to get better. There is plenty of guns, all with different recoil patterns. There are many maps in the game, and new ones are added during operations. There are also community maps you can play with friends as well. The other gamemodes to competitive are more casual gamemodes, but are usually not as enjoyable, due to the lack of skill groups meaning you will end up against better or worse opponents to yourself.   Graphics and Optimisation Graphics are not the main aim of CS:GO. They are nothing special, but are definately improved over previous games. The game is decently optimised, and can run on many machines, even old ones!   Additional Content The game has microtransactions in the form of weapon skins. They offer no in-game advantage and simply change the appearance of the weapon. They can be bought in the form of cases and keys, bought off the market individually or earned by playing the game as drops. You can sell the weapons and cases you earn from playing the game on the market, equip them for yourself or trade with other players.   Value This game is probably my most played game on Steam. I bought the game on sale for £2.50, but to be honest it's worth the full £12. If you do end up getting it on sale, you could probably earn the money back from weapon skins, or even profit. Of course, this is even possible when buying the game for the full price, but less likely.   Aspect Score (/10)   Gameplay 10   Graphics & Optimisation 6   Additional Content 10   Value 10   Pay to win? No   OVERALL 10 Notes: I rate this game to be the best FPS game I have ever played!!! I don't rate any other game on Steam I have higher, I recommend this for literally anyone!			"

												I really want to recommend this game. It's a more immersive shooter than any of the Call of Duty series, and the way the game is made requires logical thinking and tactical strategies to win rounds with your teammates. When the game goes well, it's buckets of fun.Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game to newcomers. There are many reasons for this. First of all, unless you plan to mill around in deathmatch or the other lesser-played game modes (so anything but casual/competitive), you're going to die, a lot. And then you wait. You watch your uncooperative anonymous Russian teammates slowly break apart and lose the rounds in the most ludicrious fashion. If you can stand the game long enough to become half decent at it, you may find that you can often shoot someone in the head, literally tracing the bullet into their cranium, only to see that it doesn't register the hit due to the sub-standard 64 tickrate matchmaking servers and/or your West Country internet connection, thus falling victim to yet another unfair situation. If your internet connection is not the problem, you may try using ESEA or Faceit to play your competitive matches with. So you can pay more to play the game for no benefit other than to escape the crap quality of the standard servers, or faff about on Faceit, waiting for the afk team captains to pick maps, or the other team to cower away during the initial deciding knife round. After a few bad experiences, I've decided that Faceit isn't worth the hassle. Playing competitive also puts you in danger of not only numerous wallhackers, but mainly these things called smurfs. Put the image of the little happy blue creature out of your head: these are the players with a high rank on their first steam account, then make second/third/fourth accounts to play against easier opponents. It's that simple, yet it's infuriating and game-destroying for us lower ranked players. And when you discover this in a competitive game, your only choices are to stay there and endure it, gradually losing your sanity, or take a competitive ban. If you're lucky enough to have decent friends, they may just kick you from the game, sparing you of either choice.Having played almost 3 solid week's worth of the game in total, I have accumulated a wide friend group who also shares my pain, but we still play together for the social side. This is when I can recommend the game: when you've already played a lot of CS:GO and have many friends that also play the game. If you're new, and have less patience than a special forces marksman, you're going to hate this game. I hope that if you decide to play this game, you can take my advice with a pinch of salt, as I am admittedly easily riled up in the heat of the moment. However, if you too go ape, you only have yourself to blame.Also, look out for skin collecting. I've been caught by it, it saps a lot of your money, and is literally an addiction. Not a good one like being immersed in a fandom or crack cocaine: one that's ultimately utterly pointless.			"

												Counter Strike: Source to me is one of the most fun games I have ever layed hands on, and Global Offensive does not dissapoint. This game is easy to get into, yet difficult to master. You can play competitively, or casually, on various well-designed maps with a great and large community. You can try out Counter Strike: Source for a couple of bucks less and if you enjoy it, then this game definetly is a must-have.			"

												I must recommend this game, it is my duty as one who has spent 1600 hours on CSS (from xFire) and 500+ hours on CSGO. I played non-stop competitive CS:Source in regional championships, LANs, and online leagues; and won 4 regional championships with some LAN placings. Here's what I have to say about GO...CSGO is awesome, Valve delivered here in the end. When it was released, yeah, it wasn't anything special, just a pretty CS:Source. But now we have amazing gun skins, stickers, awesome knives, intense major tournaments, souvenir packages, bracket prediction challenges, seasonal operations with extra maps and challenges for even more drops, etc.It's awesome, it's a great game to be a part of.Matchmaking and rated matchmaking based personal ELO rankings is a sweet way to keep competitive games close. It can never be perfect, but back in Source you had to wait in an IRC channel with a looped message playing until someone finally answered your loop and then it took them 20 minutes to get 5 in the server, etc. Basically with CS:Source whether you were trying to ring or you had your team it took between 20-60 minutes to get a scrim. Now it takes about 5. So, the fact that people still complain about it is beyond me.Game play wise, each CS as I know them (1.6, Source, GO) has been different beasts in terms of mechanics and recoil control. Lots of little things that made or broke you as a player in these games, but recoil control is one of the biggest. You often hear people scream “deathmatch deathmatch deathmatch, that's the only way to get better”. Well, quick point, how can you DM to practice when you don't know what your practicing? Best thing to do to understand the recoil patterns is load an offline game, kick the bots, and shoot at walls. Seriously. Shoot and spray at walls with various guns at various ranges with various movement patterns, that's the best way to understand how to control and use various guns. You need to understand each guns grouping patterns first before you can practice controlling them!About the community, yes, the flamers and trolls are alive and well. But here's the thing, I've been around CS a long time, I've won 4 regional championships with CS:Source, and really it never bothered me that sometimes the flamers are all you hear. Here's why. Once you play enough games (competitive or otherwise) you'll hear the same kind of person, it'll sound like this.. “you guys suck, why are you even playing this game?” or something similar if they are beating you. It sounds like this, “you're such a hacker, it's so obvious” when you beat them. The fact that people are so binary in their mentality amuses me personally, so I carry that over to CS flamers as well. Some people like to pretend they are perfect at the game, and everyone else around them is inferior, yet if you beat them you must be a hacker. It just sounds so stupid to even talk about it but seriously this is how a lot of people are about the game. Just don't let it get to you, there's no point. Don't even engage. And you wont have many problems.It's not the easiest game to pick up right off the bat. “Spray at feet, get headshot” is a notorious saying from outsiders about CS games, because CS can be amazingly random sometimes. And the round-by-round economy, buying guns and items every round, and recoil patterns make it a steep learning curve. But if you understand the groupings (I said how to above), read guides about strategy (like economy management, game flow), and just get in there and start playing you will see why people just can't stop playing this game!Counter-Strike was the world's original eSport. After the Championship Gaming Series went down the CS1.6 and CS:Source attention did as well, games like StarCraft and DOTA took to the forefront of competitive eSports soon after. But with the cases, skins, and major tournaments Valve and the CS community have turned CS:GO back into one of the world's premiere eSports and there's many, many reasons why it's succeeding. As I say, it's a very exciting game to be a part of right now.			"

												Note: This is a temporary review, I'm still pretty new to the game so I'll write another one when I invest/waste more hours on it-My First GameI remember it really well, because it was a game that summed up CSGO almost perfectly. Dust 2, a micspammer named ""Martin Shkreli"" playing MLP at earrape volume, 12 year olds on the mic and no strategy apart from ""Rush B"". I had no idea what I was doing, no idea about what weapons were good and bad and most importantly no idea how spray control functioned. Not surprisingly I went 1 and 13, or something like that.-GamemodesCasual is more or less a big amount of players running around with no evident strategy apart from the goal to get a good KD ratio. 60% of the time Dust 2, 30% Mirage and 10% another map such as Cache or Cobblestone. However these maps you most likely will play in Competitive, so you can sharpen your ""skills"" and map knowledge here pretty easily.Competitive can be amazing, and it can be terrible. It all depends on how good your team is, and how good the opposing team is.I strongly recommend you play with at least one friend who is at a similar skill level to yourself so you don't get a team full of bogans/russians/idiots/whatever.If I solo queue my team will look something like this (at it's worst, some solo queue games can be cool):MeAmerican guy who calls strats but nobody listensAngry Australian guy who yells through his mic when we loseAnother guy who never talks or communicates and has connection issuesSomeone half decent at the game but gets irritated with his team OR a 12vieOther team:Uber SmurfSomeone terrible at the game but gets carried by good teamiesSomeone in a partySomeone else in the same party who says ""ez"" every time they win a roundAnime Enthusiast who always runs AWP and ScoutUh, I haven't actually tried out any other gamemodes like Arms Race and Deathmatch, but from YouTube they look pretty cool. -Weapons and Strategy, Silver Style.Terrorists (assuming they win each round)-Round One: Tec 9 Rush B♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Idi Nahui-Round Two: Some SMG -Round Three: AKs-Round Four and onwards: Someone buys an AWP, rest buy AKs and ArmorCounter Terrorists (assuming they win each round)-Round One: Five Seven or Armor plus Decoy-Round Two: Some SMG-Round Three: P90 or M4/M4A1-S-Round Four and onwards: Someone buys an AWP, rest buy M4/M4A1-S or P90 and ArmorEco Round? Doesn't exist in low Silver xDSave? Doesn't really happenStrategy? ""B"", ""Rush B ♥♥♥♥♥"", ""Long A"", ""Short A"", ""A split"" and that's about it.You WILL get yelled at if you use the Autosnipers, P90, camp with an AWP or ""accidentally"" teamkill.-Rank up SystemCS:GO has 2 rank systems, one for the whole game in which you get random items drops when you level up and one that is only applicable in Competitive which determines the skill level of players you will play with/against. Having a separate rank system for Competitive is a great idea, as it encourages players to play more and work as a team. However this can be abused, and Valve can't really do anything about it.-SmurfingA ""smurf"" is basically someone who is reasonably experienced at the game and  creates/buys an alt account to play against others who have a lower skill level. You can detect smurfs by looking at their steam profiles, if they have few friends, low hours in other games etc. If you manage to kill a smurf, rub it in their face. You killed someone who most likely has a far higher skill ceiling than you did, and tilting them is a perfect way to get them mad and not thinking logically. Sure its a dirty tactic, but who really cares in this game.-VAC System/OverwatchYeah not much of an expert on this one, since I can't really detect subtle hackers etc. However I think it's a little better than the TF2 VAC system, since players in the community can review evidence sent to them (if they have Overwatch) and make the decision.-CommunityI've heard many times that the CS:GO community is ""toxic"" and ""cancer"" because of the people that play the game. It's true, if you play this game you WILL meet horrible and mean people who sweat and scream when they die. But thats what makes CS:GO stand out from other games, it's much more than a game for millions of players. Many people basically spend all their time playing this game, and I don't blame them. Personally I can't get bored of this game, there is always something new you can do. Without the ""toxic"" community CS:GO probably would not drag in as many players as it has currently, but that's just my opinion. In game the community is very vocal, with about half the players using a mic to yell/call strats/communicate (good or bad?).-Stereotypical CS:GO players in Australia/NZ""Sweaty Nerds"" who play basically nonstopUnmarried Adult Males who yell at their teammates- ""Yo, this guy is literally a 20 year old male!""Guys who pretend to be girls with their profile pics but you realize they're not :/Cuties and Hotties (right here)Rich Kiddies who spend money on skins to look sexy but they suck at the game (here again...)Australian Bogans (basically Russians here)Anime Profile Pic who is really good at the gamePeople with no skins that do really well 12vie micspammers...jeez there a lot of themGrill GamersPeople who add you because of your skins and make crazy offers for them-YouTube presence/MLG CS:GOThere are a TON of amazing CS:GO YouTubers out there. I recommend you check out WarOwl, MojoOnPC, Sparkles, Nick Bunyun, 3kliksPhillip etc. The tutorials can be pretty helpful, and give you some game sense. I know NOTHING about MLG CS:GO but it seems pretty big. I basically chose a team at random, Envyus, and supported them.PashaBiceps will always be my favorite player though, since he balances out his time spend gaming with exersize to keep fit.-CS:GO Skins and CasesI've already spent around 450 dollars to buy the skins I want. Hey, it's better than wasting thousands gambling away money to dodgy websites. Also I wouldn't recommend unboxing CS:GO Cases, as you should just buy off the Community Market and not rely on luck to make unlikely profit. However if you have money you want to waste unbox away and pray for a knife/glove.-Valve/Game DevelopersEh, I've seen many reviews saying that ""CS:GO is dying/Valve pays no attention to the game anymore/OMG Valve is ditching us for Dota!!"" and this possibly could be true. Valve just wants money, like any business would. However I don't really any need for Valve to do much more than make sure the game is balanced and running correctly (Unlike TF2 which has a 5 man development team). Note again that this is just my current opinion, since I'm still a newbie to the game.-Friendly Aspect to the game?Knife fights mid don't really count, and the only friendly game I played was on Cache with people spraying♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on the wall. I left that one, what a surprise. CS:GO is a VERY competitive game, so I wouldn't reccomend going friendly as you'll most likely get killed and kicked. Stick to Hightower.-Overall OpinionIt's an amazingly good game, it could do with a little bit more attention from Valve but has a huge player base (constantly second most played on steam) and will not ""die"" anytime soon. The community is very...diverse...but don't take anything mean they say seriously and you should be gucci okay :) The game is played across the globe, hence the name GLOBAL offensive and will be for many years to come. Dayum, that was a LONG review, its just that CS:GO has so much in it to cover.			"

												Примерный опыт любой игры в КС ГО- Ищешь игру, поиск лагает, пикает, кнопка то появляется, то исчезнает, кликаешь на нее чувствуя себя бабуином в клетке- Допустим игру нашел. Против тебя 3 человека со 100 часами которые ставят интстант хедшоты с 200 метров спустя 0.1 секунды появления из-за угла. Хм странно. Эти же люди простреливают тебе голову через стену когда ты спокойно сейвишь свое оружие в самом дальнем углу карты.- Покупаешь галил. Достаешь его, и тут же начинаешь рассматривать — рофл со сломанной анимацией руки которую не чинят 5 лет- Ставишь повсюду граффити. Спасибо габен 10/10 игра, вообще нра граффити ставить от души брат- Игра кончилась. Решил посмотреть реплей, можешь все таки тогда тебя как то видели, а не по ВХ прострелили?- ""Загруженный файл поврежден. Удалите матч и загрузите его заново""			"

												It's modern version of cs 1.6 and I think its more realistic with new design of skins, walls and everything. Its really good game to play with friends. Ranking and competitive game systems are most valuable things in Global offensive. There are achievements for achieve-hunters, arms race (typical gun-game) or demolition mode - so game has everything I wanted.CS:GO settings is changing all the time, but it will only anger you, so dont care about it just play! :DStill the best multiplayer FPS.8.5 /10Must love that gun.

												1.Csgo has the biggest hacking community that i know of, valve does nothing to fix this and will not do anything to attempt to fix it. You can't tell me that cheaters are not in prime matchmaking because i see them all the time, ingame lvl 1 never setup their steam account nothing, but somehow they can bypass it.2.Csgo has been broken since the start, hit reg, player models. I realize that not all games are perfect but the game has been out since 2013 don't you think that should of been fixed a long time ago? How about updateing servers to 128 tick like you did you dota 2, maybe even making a better anticheat.Overall Csgo is very garbage, yet i keep playing because it's one of my favorite competitive shooters Valve please fix your broken♥♥♥♥♥♥people are getting really tired of your♥♥♥♥♥♥ Good thing you made sure you got those gamma 2 cases out.Valve thank you for being the ♥♥♥♥♥est game producing company ever, you truely are not the MVP.

												This game should really be taken off of steam, the game is filled to the brim with smurfs and hackers. I have tried getting into it with friends on three different time and each time i get more dissapointed. The ammount of players never changes. The only reason they still have it as one of the top selling games is because of all the people buying for alternate accounts and its just sad that they have to do that please don't give valve money for this trainwreck they get enough from all the smurfs and hackers buying it for their alternate accounts.

												The only thing this competitive game has that compares to call of duty is it's FPS aspect and a few of the guns. Otherwise, it's an upgrade to the original Counter Strike, 1.6, and source with a few additional game modes and better graphics. What I like about this game above it's predecessors is it's offline bots. The dedicated fans that have been playing CS for multiple years makes the online multiplayer very difficult (which is a good thing). So, what I like about this game is the offline bot mode, which allows people who buy this game to enjoy a little pwnage (or challenge when they crank up the difficulty to veteran) when they can't get it online. Also, everyone has an equal chance, not thrown off by prestiging or leveling up, which adds balance.Overall, it's a fun, challenging, and addicting game -- I'd recommend it to all gamers! Especially those who enjoy a good FPS.			"

												This game went from good to horrible over the last year. Updates were done to involve new cases to produce this company money instead of improving this game. Every other game, free to play games, bought games anything is improving and granting a better experience, while this game remains on the same point and even goes back, by those unnecessary sound updates. Cheating players continue with their hacks,  bad tickrates are not getting fixed, instead new stickers and pins are realeased. Overall this game is no more playable at all, it deserve this huge drop of players wanting to play this bad game.Will not play this again, this game is definetly done for me.			"

												It is kind of hard to say I do not like the game after > 1100 hours of gameplay. It is very addictive! What I love about the game is the fact that skill matters and that every player, from total noob to pro-level, has the same arsenal of guns to use. You can not get better guns or upgrades by investing money, meaning it is skill, experience and teamwork (and connection) that  makes the difference.  But you can give your guns a personal touch, by getting different skins, adding a personal name to a weapon and add stickers.  I really like the bomb defusal mode (or bomb placement when you are a terrorist), but there are also other game types: Hostage rescue, Armsrace , Deathmatch and Demolition.  Also there is a big library with player made map, all with their own rules and styles. (aim training, headshots only, all vs all, achievement maps, platformstyle and surfmaps) This is my first ever FPS, so needed the first 1k hours (i am a very slow student) to learn how to hold a gun, how to recognize enemies and friends, learn game mechanics and map based tactics and to work well in a team, etc.  The overall crappy community is not making it easy to learn the game, because specially as a starting player you get kicked out of matches all the time.  Hey I am silver 1 (lowest competative ranking) , of course I am not a star player!  Many other players on that same level are hacking, have second accounts, or are experienced in other shooters.  And their patience level with newcomers is about 0.  So a mistake (even if i had no clue i made one) resulted often in an insta kick. Most absurt thing was getting kicked out of a casual match for being noob...omg really?:)  If you can't practice in a  competative match, and get kicked out of casual matches too...then how on earth can you learn how to play?  Despite an overall crappy community, I met some awesome people. Lot of fun to play together, preferably in a full team, or just some casual matches, armsrace, deathmatch or training.  And training does pay off! Anyway, you would think that by now I am a pro, but hell no! I guess I have to conclude I am not talented enough to get to a high rank. On the bright side....I do not get kicked out of a team anymore, at least not that often....must be doing something good!Still playing daily, and still loving it!   So... recommended?  Hell yeh! NB I just have to mention that that laguage used ingame is really bad... Maybe thats just my feminine view., but I think it extremely childish and limited to the same scolding words over and over. Quite pathetic to be honest.  I  learned to ignore it.  Loving the mute button!  I just hope that it is not a reflection of those people irl. That would be really sad.			"

												One of the worst communities in gaming. Griefers, cheaters, squeaky kids, flamers... Theres every type of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that you could possible think of. Every 4th match is a cheater, every 2nd match u get griefers and every single, i mean EVERY single ♥♥♥♥ing match you'll see a flamer in your team constantly trying to kick you or just bully you into leaving by abusing the voice chat. The reasons that you can get kicked in competitive matches are so immature and sad that it's become a serious problem:1.Ofc if you have the lowest score in the first 4 rounds they won't hesitate to vote kick you (even if your score is just 1 or 2 below theirs)2.If you have the least amount of kills. Degenerates don't ♥♥♥♥ing get that, in a 5v5 match, there's always going to be someone on the bottom of the scoreboard.3.My personal favorite, if you dont use one of the following weapons: M4, AK47, AWP chances are pretty high you're going to get voted off regardless of your score.4.Along with these, every ♥♥♥♥-up in terms of losing the round for your team (failed bomb defuse, failed plant, especially if you fail a 1v1, etc etc)Bottom line is that the community is dogshit and the only way to enjoy the game is if you have a 4 or 5-man party.Any lower than that you are gonna be paired with one of the mentioned dip♥♥♥♥♥.The rest of the game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ only the competitive part can be interesting and fun so if you dont have friends who play CS GO i would recommend you to stay as far away from this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥community as you possibly can.6/10year olds.

												I´ve been playing cs series for 15 years since 1.3 came out. I swear I have never been dissapointed more by any game in my gaming history than by CSGO. I have never followed the trend of buying useless skins for huge amounts of money, music kits, sprays...name it. It´s really beyond me how easily can most of you become so influenced and basically forced to buy more and more absolutely useless content for this game. But the main issue is that valve instead of fixing at least some of the ingame issues just keep adding more and more of that moneygrabbing stuff. I really donno why so many people defend this game. Yes, if you play with bunch of friends constantly it can be fun for a while. I have no problems with admitting it. Other than that, there is literally nothing more.- worst community in history of pc games- practically nobody cares about cheaters beside ESEA - important ingame issues not adressed - absolutely unlogic and unfair MM penalty system- optionable but massively overpriced ingame purchases- rise of the internet gambling and criminal activitiesPlease people open your eyes. I know most of u will disagree with me instantly but try to think about some pro and cons. And i can assure you that in 2k16 there is definitely comparable or better game for any aspect u can think of. And if you really want to play CSGO whatever your reason is, play ESEA only.			"

												I don't get why Valve doesn't just listen to it's players. I mean the game is made for us, right? The new update just completely destroyed the game, it's just no fun anymore. They need to set the competetive times to pro league standarts, give us an unranked comp mode and undo those stupid ak, m4 and pistol nerfs. Stop doing stupid updates Valve. Just ask us, I think we know pretty well what we want...			"

												If you're reading this review, be sure to read all of it due I placed an update, but I did not want to change the original review. this game is 7/10Positive: [✓] Huge community (veteran players, kids, noobs, masters) [✓] amazing eSport scene [✓] Example of a team work game Negative [✓] worst system anti cheater, they can do it better, but they will not do it because valve love sell more copies to the cheaters [✓]64 tick. WTF valve!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WE NEED MORE! [✓] CHEATER EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!!, IN DM, CASUALS, MM, DEMOLITION AND GUNGAME CHEATER EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!!!!!this game is 7/10EDIT: update (3 of july 2015)I have been following the complete scene of this game and im back here to change something about my original review (that I have not modified and you can read it above).Valve is listening to the community and they have been doing constant VAC ban waves.Also they put some new system to prevent the immediately access in MatchMaking to the cheaters and smurfers (in this part i dont mind but for a lot of people is a issue, they are listening) Now i can say 8/10. Great game.EDIT: feb/11/2016 some wrong spelled words.EDIT: 23/NOV/2016this game has evolved a lot:constantly updates, some really bad updates like music kits, graffiti sprays just to get more money BUT there is some other excelent updates like hitbox fixes, animations, maps updates, etc.A great try to keep cheaters annoyed to cheat in MM, the new prime system is a good attempt to delay cheaters. and without doubt this system has reduced the cheaters in MM if you use your prime accountThe best eSport scene! It has grown so much! "

												Counter-Strike: Global Offensive truly is a game like no other.In Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, you are tasked with globally offending as many people as you possibly can in 30 rounds, with an array of tools such as mic spam, teamkilling, or racist bullet messages. It differs from the original Counter-Strike (Known as '1.6' because there are 1.6 people still playing) in the fact that it's not 37 years old.Counter-Strike Hardline refines the tried and true formula of Police (Voiced by Nolan North) vs Counter-Police (Voiced by Troy Baker), bringing in many new faces to each team, such as Jewish Toad from Super Mario Bros, a black guy, a ghost with a beret, and a hot topic customer.Counter-Strike: Black Ops adds exactly 3 new zones for you to wreak havoc in, bringing the total amount of maps to 1, but makes up for it with a large arsenal of over 70 weapons, which I will now list for you.-Ak-47-M4-AWPAll in all, Counter-Strike: Global Defensive is a robust top down open world third person beat 'em up that tweaks the gunplay to its best, with amazing graphics and sound design, it's bound to keep you hooked until Counter-Strike 5.0/5			"

												The 2 year and 2000hr summary; Pro – One of the most popular games on the steam networkCon – One of the most popular games on the steam networkPro – Immersive, complex and highly teamwork dependent game. Con – The lobby system, the matchmaking system and general practice of  “alternate accounts” really tends to crap all over the above mentioned pros. Pro – Allot of cool stuff available to buy, trade, sell! The trading and marketplace really brings a whole new perspective to gaming while teaching us valuable real world lessons.Con – With that being said, its almost impossible to not spend more money then the initial price. Getting tricked by scumbag traders, account hacked and your awesome stuff stolen are only the tip of cringe stories. Oh did I mention they are just skins with no function? :DConclusion: *smacks forehead* Look... The game is JUST OKAY. IT IS NOT the ultimate online pc shooter, but learning to play CAN BE TONS OF FUN with your friends. Hmm, whats this? Catch a little confidence? No worries!! Keep playing and the awesome CSGO community will be right there to rip it all to shreds and shove it back in your face. Cheers!That's all.. You may catch a few laughs outta the sh*** I wrote in the past down below, but with this summary my review is now complete. Peace out. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WOW... Just wow... Smurfs, Jerks and hackers! DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME COMPETETIVE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE FUN !!! (Unless, fun to you is getting aggravated, being yelled at for not playing good and not knowing everything about the game.) If you wish to gain a good rank, join a team who will help you get carried or boost you for money. As for ranking up as an individual the only way to do that, is to have friends who have the proper skills for a highly competitive gameplay and all you have to do is plant or defuse the bomb while they cover for you... You then learned nothing. :/ That makes it a TEAM GAME I guess. That way you can gain team points PER ROUNDS WIN and that is all !!! Kill / death ratio doesn't matter anymore, you are as GOOD or as CRAP as your team is. Level up with your friends or they will soon not play with you and you get stuck in what is referred to as ""silver hell."" Good luck getting out of that because, it means allot of headaches as these teams will consist of players who legit ""don't know what they are doing"" against players who purchased a secondary account and posses the seemingly PRO SKILLS you DO NOT when you're wanting to learn and get better at competitive gameplay. You'll just end up getting killed by them, your team will yell at you and you will suffer though a horrible loss, because you cannot abandon a match without receiving a ""cooldown time"" an you will learn NOTHING!!! These highly skilled players with secondary low rank accounts are so called ""smurfs."" They are a form of cyberbullies who like stroke their own d***ks while they play against inexperienced players who are trying to figure out how to play better. All the while smurfs are calling you names, aggravating you and causing team moral to drop. Soon your whole team is yelling at you and practically forcing you to quit and once again you learned nothing... Do yourself a favor and don't pay for mental anguish! GLHF! (Good luck, have fun. Which this game is neither!)-----Update 1------Yes, a bit of clearing up is need even if this review is long enough as is. One part I agree with Pete, the casual and deathmatch modes are flooded, where the competitive side is strictly teams of 5 v 5. As in how to deal with smurfs and hackers is not that straightforward. No one plays comp to purposely loose. (Unless you're trolling or want to derank your account.. but why!?) Face it, loosing sucks but specially when item drops have also been reduced to nothing and when they do they are items that are in extremely bad condition and worth only a few cents. Then the only way to battle the smurfs is to have friends who are willing to teach you the game. That way when you pull together as a team, utilize your grenades well, pay attention to positioning and aim, you will have a fighting chance because usually the smurf is the last one or two player(s) alive. Only then it could be made into a monster! :DGood luck and (try to) have fun!----Update 2-----Thanks for all the responses everyone!The rank and matchmaking system is for the lack of a better word, is bonkers! :DI actually enjoy helping new players with tips and hints on getting better. It's just something I've gotten to a great liking of eversince leading the CS:S division of a multigaming clan back in those days.One other thing recently occurred to me while playing CS:GO, is that hours played and kill / death ratio should also come into factor.For instance, when I started out in CS:GO I was invited to comp matches by friends who are in the range of Nova-2 to Master Guardian ranks. I've quickly received my Silver Master Elite rank, which I went onto advance into the mid Nova range. Solo queing and just general messing around (once the game was an inevitable loss) I have managed to derank my account to the mid silver range. I keep performing in the mid range of the score board also, but its by choice because I've came to accept the fact that its going to take me a reeaallyy long time to gain my nova ranks back. When I'm asked to pull it together its not hard for me to get kills, give good strats and sometimes even start to carry my team.I just cant help but be frustrated when I do constantly perform good and is top mvp and every 10 game or more still not budge a rank.GLHF, but most importantly HAVE FUN because that's up to each and every one of us to enjoy the game even if its a bit broken!

												This is a really good, casual yet uncasual multi-player FPS that pits two teams against one another. The Terrorists and the counter-terrorists (counter strikers). The terrorists need to make it to specific bomb drop points and hold the position until the bomb goes off. The counter-strikers need to kill the terrorists need to disarm the bomb if it is set or if they kill a terrorist holding the bomb before it is set, they need to make sure no one picks up the bomb to set it. If all members of one faction die, they lose the round. There is no respawn until the next round. All rounds take place on the current map. You don't go to a different map until the match ends.Since you play a few rounds per game (let's say 15 rounds), you get cash for each round win or lose and you can spend that cash at the start of each round on weapons and stuff. So the game increases as you go from just pistols and knives in the first round to much bigger guns in the later rounds. You can also pick up a weapon off the ground and use it as well (unless you've set the rules to restrict such things). You'll keep the weapon from round to round until you die. Its a nice system.It is a great game dynamic with good maps that have the right amount of side paths and choke points to cover. The maps are small enough where there will always be some sort of action happening, but large enough where the action can happen at places you aren't.There is no single player campaign, but you can play maps on your own with bots that have difficulty levels. You can even jump into a bot if you die since there is no respawn until the next round. You'll notice the easy bots take their time to shoot you as well as you can tell watching them they intentionally don't aim directly at you. This is PERFECT FOR BEGINNERS to pick up and play, but of course the bots get more difficult.The game makes headshots instant kills and goes more along the realism path where if you jump and shoot, you're less accurate. When you kneel and shoot you're more accurate.It's a fun game that fills a different niche than Team Fortress 2. Give it a try over a free weekend and its also dirt cheap.			"

												The reason why I WOULD NOT recommend this game to anyone is because Valve has failed miserably for 17 years trying to make this game cheater unfriendly. Hacking/cheating is the worst. Seriously this game has a great history of people cheating and Valve tries really hard, but not seeing any improvement since 1999. Even recently professional players are getting caught cheating. I will like to say to Valve, when....... when will you guys stop putting your heads up your asses and start being less lazy on these cheaters. Banning them wont work for♥♥♥♥♥♥ You guys update this game all the time, but these updates are making us have less and less fps and for some reason, creating MORE cheaters. Why do  I have to pay for ESEA just so I can face less cheaters?My suggestions:1. Make this game $39.99 (this will make it harder for cheaters to keep on buying more accounts)2. Go to these hackers website and buy their cheats so you guys can keep your anti cheat updated. (they update this every week or so)3. Make it so their ip address is banned from playing this game. (once a cheater, always a cheater). "

												I loved this game. I hate it now. It's riddled with smurfs, hackers and outright trolls. I'm sick of it. On top of all this my ranking system is ♥♥♥♥ed along with my matchmaking. I get placed with a team of trolls and idiots whilst the other team consists of 3 smurfs DMG on main. ♥♥♥♥ing cheers valve. This game is unique and the gameplay and mechanics are fantastic. However the game is dragged down by screaming children and trolls. I'm silver 3 with 97 wins and about 90% of my friends that are terrible at the game are a higher rank. I'm not amazing but I'm pretty decent. I top frag every game and I still don't rank up. Yesterday, I played one game. My team were a bunch of 12 year olds and trolls and I was up against 2 smurfs. Thanks. I get kicked, because the trolls think it's funny to kick people for no reason and then guess what? The rank I just worked 40+ wins to get is gone. ♥♥♥♥ing gone. I'm done with this game. My ranking system is glitched/♥♥♥♥ed and my matchmaking system is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Why am I so unlucky? Just why. ♥♥♥♥ing unbelievable.			"

Or having your eardrums near destroyed by your teammate blasting Russian music down the mic.This topped with smurfs and being accused of hacking if you happen to get more than one headshot in a round, make the game no longer enjoyable for me anymore.It just shows what the effect of a community can have on a game.

												Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is certainly an excellent game, the best of the series, with the graphics qualities.Matchmaking brings a real interest in the game by providing a constant increase in its level and offering games based on its level through the presence of a rank system, it is increasing or decreasing the contrary based on win / loss matches obtained.The acquisition of different badges and trophies displayed on their profile and the ability to get weekly boxes to receive new skins for its weapons is a complete success and brings a real interest in the game.In addition, every quarter a new operation allows us to discover completely new maps and fill new goals for a new badge.Prime matchmaking avoids blatant cheats.Very good game!

												They know me as the headshot machine. They know me from the highlight they see. They know me from the matches they watch. They talk about my one taps and they think for me aiming is so easy. I just go into a match and that's it. But my aim, it's comes from more than just a game. For me - aim - it is about precision... This part people don't see. This part, it does not show up in highlights. When I sit down to play everything already is a part of me... "

												lleyo evyrran. today ill let you know that cs is a gud game with highly skilld people ( like me and my lads )we like to play cs a lot but sometimes we get mad because the other team is better than us...this is very rough and we call them cheaters to justify that people cant be better than us. I sometimes break my table but its ok, my mammy always gets me stuff so im good. I also break other things, but i still get new stuff.Best way to play this game is if you take a walk then do some squads and then proceed to play a little bit of deathmatch where you can hear grim russians talking a little bit of ♥♥♥♥♥ language.This is also a very good start of the day to me. I love spamming with radio commands to the point where my team tries to kick me, sadly they cant. I always play with a lad who is always there to back me up, and he always votes no so i keep on spamming radio commands! Sometimes i dont play too good but its okay i just play the next day. i like to use the sniper Ayy double you Pee <3 becauase back in the good olde days i used to play mw2 where i was a professional amateur quickscoper. There is also guns like the ak but i dont like that because the bullets go up and thats not fun for me when i shoot.i haf ben playing a little bit of cs for a while and im actually global max rank. Sometimes i get happy when i derank cuz then i can rank up again and you get very happy when you rank back up!this game is very gud if you like to meet new people and exploit other cultures cs is the game for you.ddust 2 is a good map that you should play all the time!i luv cs goOooooO♥♥♥♥ dots and commas you can put em your self if you need it.

												After I've recently been informed of shady gambling practice, using csgo skins as a form of casino currency like chips on gambling websites and seeing this practice has gone out of control without the support of valve to fix the issue, I'd say they even joined the dark side. I'm a gamer and the competitive play of this game is amazing. But this game rapidly turned sour when you see each updates coming not only with new maps and fixes but also with crates that you need a 2 dollar key to open and get a skin that you can either keep or sell on the market it raises the question whether or not valve really wants to get rid of the monetary value of said skins, especially when you see extremely rare skins that don't add any bonuses other than esthetic going above 400 dollars on the market.I love valve, my best fps experiences came from their games and I'm still waiting for hl3, but this new counter strike is going into a direction that I'm sure they know is not ethically great and that they want to remove this issue with the monetary value of their game skins, but they don't stress it enough.Overall great game and I'm still playing it, but the major con is this superficial bling bling that can be very costly to young uninformed gamers that goes in those gambling sites.

 An average  motivational review of matchmaking (ranked) reactions.  If you win: Spam stuff!  >examples: ez, boosted silvers.. Show everyone how loud your voice is.. >examples: FFFUuuU, EZ, NOOBS ..Rage about a weapon or case that should have dropped for you, but instead dropped for someone else! >example: OMG WHY YOU GOT IT WITH YOUR SH*T SCORE AND I GOT NOTHING .. Demand commendations from your team, when you finish the game with like 10 kills more than anyone in team or game! >example: Commend me b*tches for free carry!Report the enemy with highest score!>Obviously this guy cheated in the end, to turn around the match! Thank your team for the match (and the enemy team in some cases)>example: FFFUU all.. This was so easy..  >example 2 (ONLY when you got the lowest score): Thanks everyone for match! You did great! .. IF you lose Again, spam stuff!>examples: omfg noob team kids russians spanish aliens no mic no sound..Once more, show your maturity and multilanguage skills over mic!>examples: report all, p90 noobs, scar noobs, awp noobs, ssg noobs .... wh, aims ..Report all enemies! >Obviously you lost the match because they had one or everyone were cheaters!Show the weakest enemy (score) how lucky he was>example: STFU NAB YOU WERE CARRIED! If you get an item you were the best in your team so you deserved it. Show it to your teamates>example: Nabs fffuu all at least i got an item for trying!If you lose a rank (like from MGE back to MG2 etc), let your teamates know..>Tell them how bad they are and that your going to report everyone for this great loss!If you had the lowest score>Tell your team how bad was your day, your lag, your cat giving you allergies.. Or you can blame your team for not dropping you an awp.. Spam for a kick! You are so good. You wont lose that rank because of nabs ruinning your match.. You demand a kick NOW!>You get a kick, all is well.. flame a bit then get back on matchmaking...>You won't get a kick: Flame those nabs.. They are wasting your time and money!! Think fast.. how long since your last CD? Week? 2 weeks? GOOD! Next round pick up your shotgun and blow your teamate's head.. 30 minutes? One hour? pff you can go to trade and check the kniev! prices!AMAZING GAME 11/10! Would spend 500$ for a knife!!			"

												In Cancer Strike: Global Duty, you play as the sunflower from Plants vs Zombies. Your goal is simple, defend your team's nexus from the opposing forces known as ""anonymous"".There are three different weapons in this game, two of which are useless. The first is a gravity gun, stolen from the Half Life series (looks like these guys are going to get sued.) The second is a bag of pretzels, which restores health, but can damge enemies if thrown, and if the salt gets in their eyes. The third, and only useful weapon, is the PP-Bizon. This gun is overpowered in my opinion, and needs to get nerfed quickly, as it has 64 shots per clip, and more bullets means more damage.I'm currently Challenger in the ranking system, which was far too easy to get, seeing as I previously played skilled shooters such as Putt Putt Saves the Zoo. However, this being said, if you choose to embark on your journey to Master Chief rank, be warned. You will face countless cheaters who will spawn infinite money so that the enemy team can buy all of the different hats available. In my opinion, Volvo should remove the hats, and replace them with weapon skins. But who am I kidding, who would be stupid enough to buy those?If you're coming here from other shooters such as call of men, you're going to have a bad time. The closest game to this, in my opinion, would have to be Everquest. If you've ever played this, you should be alright coming into an environment such as this one, except with worse hit registering.Overall, I'd rate Counter Salt: League Legend, an 8.1/10. No matter how bad this game actually is, people will still spend way too much money on stupid♥♥♥♥♥skins, and yell at their teamates for not checking connector.Video version of this review:

												One of the best of the CS series. Sure the first CS is the leader of them all, but CS:GO just puts the series onto a whole new level. It proves that Source can give amazing graphics as well as incredible gameplay, and it shows that CS will never die out. I think this is an amazing release made by VALVe and it's worth every penny.EDIT: Oh and to add, this review was made before the release date of CS:GO - this is to prove to the people who don't believe me when I say I was in the CS:GO closed beta.EDIT2: A screenshot of CS:GO uploaded on April 2012:

												This game clearly proves that Counter-Strike: Source is some Outdated Junk by now, and proves that the same formula that appeared in CS 1.6 back in the day is still enjoyable, if made properly, to this very day. Even though the movement and max sharpness of the mechanics has been dulled down QUITE a bit. I used to play CS:S just for target practice when idling for random reasons myself early 2013, but this game is complete enough to drag me into it. (4K h's by now) Even though again, i find there to be a lack of optimization considering how the game ran better in 2013/2014 (early), than today. 300+ fps VS today's 200-250FPS for reference.The good old killing spree MOD from 1.6 Where you can spawn many times, which was about getting the most kills against the enemy team as a team, (A clusterfu*k without reason) and the classic zombie modes that has seen a return + a ton of other older mods from the past was/is missing though. With some returning slowly but surely however, GO is looking to become the best FPS game purchasable to this very date.Thus, i recommend this game. Something i rarely do with anything. But even more so when you can get it 50% off when steam got sales!By the way, you can get all your money and more back if you sell the stuff that drops in the game on the steam market. Which include sellings EVERYTHING. Or you can waste your money on another terrible gamble that will nver pay off because you got that extra money laying around from cases you sold in CS:GO, since when they drop related to events people pay super much for them and stuff...10/10 (My old rating was 9/10) since you can eventually get your money back selling in-game items you get for free, stuff you can pay for is pushed frequently, spicing up the game if you wanna waste some money on skins, while the rest of the game is top notch compared to today's modern sub-par competition out there. The game is brutal and made for SKILLED play though, so go figure it is in general better made VS games like for example black ops 3. CS:GO has stayed on top for 2 years by now on PC, and it is looking good for at least 2 more years heading into the future!			"

												CS:GO mixes up Source and CS 1.6 gameplay.The recoil and the flashbangs are more 1.6 like and the rest is pretty much Source.In CS you have no aim-down-sights-feature what means that you have to control your fire by shooting short salves or single shots. You can also learn the gun's spraypatterns by holding down fire-key and noticing the bullet-impacts (on distance they aren't really noticable but on short to middle ranges it works pretty well). In long range firefights people mostly strafe left and right, shoot single shots and try to hit their opponents head (unrealistic.. but interessting and challenging). You can duck pretty fast but it has almost no effect on your precision. You will be slow and more vulnerable. Flanking is hard in this game, because there is no sprint and maps are designed to have clear, mostly open ways. You can hide in only very very few situations because mostly you have great visibility (It's a bit bad and sometimes irritating that you can not disable blood decals). Mostly the only cover you can get is behind corners or of course headglitch-positions. In this game you can not go phrone or lean around corners. I think leaning would be a nice addition but no.. this game is still remains classic.Armor is more helpful than it was in Source. To me it feels like it's more important to land headshots. Because of that it's rather unlikely to get wallbang-kills. It's hard to spray, there is not much hit-slowdown and armor is very powerful.. and sometimes wallbanging feels a bit random.The sound in this game is good. You mostly hear exactly when people run, shoot or jump. You can mostly locate loud players really precisely (unlike in most modern games, where you mostly have crazy boominess or randomized sound.. because of perks for example). Counter-Strike is mostly comprehensible.Some maps got a really nice overhaul (dust2, dust1, aztec, office, militia, mirage).. Train and Cobble are very different compared to Source or 1.6. Personally I don't like them that much.. Inferno is very similar to the Source-version (they only changed some wall textures and made some minor changes). It's good that Valve changed the hostage rescue mode. Now it's more tactical and more objective based, but I think this mode doesn't work that good with the old map layouts.It's sad that there are only very few new competetive maps. Instead of new official maps there are buyable community-mappacks which are available in competetive and causal matchmaking for a period of time.The ability to find or buy weapon-skins is new in CS:GO. On the one hand it is cool to have camos on your guns, on the other hand it's bad that you mostly find bad looking and/or bad quality skins (or cases). Most camos look  very colourful and not realistic. If you want good looking skins you most likely end up buying the skins for real money (on the steam marketplace).Conclusion:CS:GO is a new CS with mediocore graphics (the textures are mostly 512x512 pixels and could be better, sometimes the bloom- and post-process-effects are a bit annoying and also some animations could be better), reworked maps, new recoil and still not perfectly balanced guns (but it's fine). It has most things that the old CS-games already had but also some new things. There is ranked matchmaking, a great HUD and an easy to use replay-function. It's also very nice that you still have dedicated servers. You have the possibility to make your own maps and use server-mods. These are all great features that every modern FPS game should have.If you want to customize the look of your guns, you will have to pay for it. It's very very unlikely to find good skins and the amount of skin-drops is limited to 2-8 drops per week. All in all I think CS:GO is a game that continiues the series in a moderate way. It could be better but it could also be a lot worse. Since this game is not too expensive I can recommend you getting this game.			"

												Cs Go is the kind of game that has a great Idea, that is ruined by a handful of obnoxious and huge problems.After roughly 800 hours, this game has descended into one of the least enjoyable experiences Valve has shipped (yes, including ricochet). For those who want a nice, casual experience, there is little fun to be had here. The gameplay mechanics have a too steep and confusing learning curve, such as economic management, spray patterns and counterstrafing. For those who want to climb the ladder of sucess and ""get good"", there is also little to be had here, with♥♥♥♥♥♥poor matchmaking that doesnt even put people of similar skill levels together(This is such a huge issue that third party services that cost a fee to use like ESEA and FaceIt exist), RIDICULOUSLY unbalanced weopans (a $3100 assault rifle with a spray pattern that needs to be learnt cant kill in one headshot, yet a $500 pistol with no recoil pattern can), and perhaps the most toxic community I have ever seen(Russians who aim about as well as a lobotomized hampster will get their friends to kick you from the match, often resulting in the infamously annoying ""7 day bans from online"" for ""being kicked from to many matches""), there seems to be no way of improving upon yourself and being consistently rewarded for it instead of being put with more russian autists.Cs Go cant entertain people looking for a nice, casual online PvP game, or people who want to push themselves to their limit, and looking at how valves updating of this game has gone recently, you can even see it in the reviews. A few months ago, you would see generally light hearted, funny reviews, but after months of valve churning out a rank update which caused the first problem I noted for matchmaking, weakening its resistance against cheaters and never fixing the banning and griefing issues, Cs Go has descended into a genuiney painful experience. If theres one good online game to play, its probably rust. It gives consistent rewards for grinding, and doesnt include ANY of the above problems (whenever you kill someone in rust they go down and can still use their mic as they lie there and usually I get a ""aw GG dude"" or ""aw ♥♥♥♥ well played"")Overall, Cs Go is a wormhole of a game you dont want to fall into.

												Counter-Strike: Global Offensive took the long way to success. It started off with a number of significant flaws, but with time and some substantial patches, has become one of the most-played games on Steam and one of the best PC games you can play.As usual, the people who know the game best are the ones who spend every night and most weekends in the trenches, defusing bombs, shooting chickens, and desperately hunting for knives. Also as usual, the people who love the game most are also the ones who have the most complicated relationship with it. Play a game enough, and even if you love it, part of you will probably start to loathe it. In a loving way. If that makes sense.Generally speaking: CS:GO players love the chickens, are flummoxed by the knives, are in agreement that Dust2 is in some ways the game's only map, and hate hackers almost as much as they hate being called hackers. And of course, like any good game, for all the complaints most people have, they still can't stop playing.			"

												Old: I am an ♥♥♥♥♥♥. CS 1.6 and CS:S were better!________________________________________________________________New: Okay, after people asking me: ""Hey Axel, why does cs go suck?"", I gotta explain it.My dear friend, prepare for a long review, full of bad english and hate and♥♥♥♥♥♥and stuff and... yea, you got it. Let's start with the most annoying thing,Physics:Dear Volvo!Explain me, how to ruin source engine that hard? Corrupting bunny hopping, surfing, sliding (if someone actually remembers this game mod), football, minigames, jail (i dislike jail, but feel free to get angry if you liked it) and worst of all, trikz and kreedz.Why don't you Volvo release 2 versions of CS:GO? One for fun mods, one for competitive (which is♥♥♥♥♥♥ but i'll come later to it) and feel free to even sell it as 2 different games. I would still buy both and be happy.why the hell don't weapons have 100% precision now while standing still and doing nothing? Why does every 4th-5th shot with AK miss? Let's make every skill game to a luck game? Like minesweeper, ""skill"" - ""skill"" - ""skill"" - ""now i need to guess"".Engine:Yes, here you'll see all the complaints about tickrate, hitreg and interpolation.What is interpolation?As a player, you receive and send packets from/to server to ""communicate"" with the game. These packets contain the information you see later. Your ping is the ""speed"" of how fast you receive the packets. But no one's connection is perfect, so if we only used these packets, the game would lag and be unplayable.So there is an old trick, interpolation:You receive a packet, then you receive a second packet and the actual gameplay you see on screen is in between. This means, what you see, happens in the past and the server is a few milliseconds in the future. This is how you get shot with an awp ""while the guy was running just before he shot me OMGOMGOMG TRIQQER HAX"". In reality, the server has already calculated that he stopped and this is why his precision was nearly 100%.Let's calculate the nice and fun interpolation in MadMaking:cl_interp_ratio / cl_updaterate = cl_interp1 sec / 64 updaterate = 15,625 ms every new packet.cl_interp_ratio 2 = 2/64 = 31,25 ms for 2 packets to you receive/send so the server reacts.It may happen that a few packets get lost and hits won't be registered on server but you will see these on your screen.Now we have lag compensation.Command Execution Time = Current Server Time - Packet Latency - Client View InterpolationThis means there are small mistakes regarding where the player is and where you saw him and you have to live with it.Volvo could reduce it to minimum by doubling the server tickrate, BUT higher tickrate means higher CPU load, means higher costs and poor Volvo earns only more than Apple or Google[www.forbes.com] and can't spend more money to get better servers.You can read more about interpolation here.And more about lag compensation here.Microtransactions:Yes, I totally forgot to mention that in my review, first time i was writing it.Microtransactions are just another way to make more money by offering unnecessary content. We've already seen enough in TF2.Volvo thought, let's recreate the same marketing strategy again. And skins came out. Of course, what else could you do?Creating new paid weapons? Community would tear you in pieces, dear GabeN, because CS:GO is meant to be competitive and there is nothing competitive in pay2win.But money is not everything! There are even more reasons to add skins. There are people out there who love trading and collecting this♥♥♥♥♥♥(not to mention people who just buy em for e♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Then there are operations. If not to mention that maps are often unfinished, some are buggy, the idea is not that bad. You pay for the coin and that coin gives you stats. But again, there are missions to do and completing a mission gives you a drop - really? The marketing strategy strikes back, even more when you get a case drop as a ""reward"".Even DLCs are not that bad compared to skins. Why not making unfinished map DLCs like EA or Activision already do?Microtransactions suck.Casuals:First of all, thank you for adding a new game mod called ""Demolition"". It's quite fun when you want to waste your time on fast paced maps. Thank you for adding ""Deathmatch"" as a game mod, to play on official servers.But how did you ruin the gun game? ""Arms Race"" now puts better players in disadvantage by highlighting them red. Of course it's better for new players to find these. It's maybe fun untill you get matched versus non silvers who start wallbanging you. But to the hell with casuals, we have competitive nowdays built in CS:GO.Competitive:First of all, I am global myself and have played CS for 15 years now. And I can tell, I expected more. Global, yes, global must be global. You do get matched with people, I can't say they deserved global. I barely see the difference between eagle and global. Yes, these people are slightly better, but still only people. I expected to play vs people from high tier and not someone who ends his game with 3/5/25. Yes, some people have bad days, are sick, whatever. But this happens way too often.Competitive bans are a joke. I trolled 100 games and got reported 9999 times. Where is my ban for griefing? I never got one.Of course there are alternatives as ESL (which is dead in cs go, soon just dead) or ESEA. What do we have matchmaking for, then?Also, it happened quite often that when Steam servers went down, I finished MM and couldn't start a new one, because ""still in game"". And you abandon it and get your 10 mins ban.Smurfs, I have no problem with these since I got 6 smurfs myself. Anyways, all the new protection systems are useless, since if I want to play with friends, I do so.Cheaters, the only thing I am positive about Volvo are VAC waves. Honestly, I think this is where CS:GO made a positive progress. Of course there are cheaters out there, there will always be. But VAC bans are perma. I could wish for was that CS:GO would cost like 100€, so it'd be actually painful to buy it again and again for cheating.Conclusion:You ruined CS:S once in 2010. You still do ruin CS:GO. With horrible skins, with people who play competitive for fun (actually you people, ♥♥♥♥ off this game and play competitive for fun in Call of Duty), with engine ""tweaks"" and everything I called above + sending most people to the ""new"" CS.Oh, one more point. This game is ♥♥♥♥ing easy. It's easy as hell, there is no easier version of CS out there and there will hopefully never be. It is made this way so Volvo can sell it to 6 year olds and profit for it. Because getting pwnd is not fun, but the easiness factor is just made by money.- This is why bhop is dead!- This is why trikz/bugs are dead!- This is why they don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about the engine!- This is why competitive went full casual!- This is why you play this game!You, dear review reader, are the reason why good games die. Because you want to win and master a game in 10 hours. You don't want to ♥♥♥♥ around and master every engine exploit.You better go cry into a corner about ""that one guy was bhoping"", ""the deagle is too op"", ""this game has too many cheaters"" and ""the ban system is unfair, I got banned for 7 days, because my internet died ONCE"". Do your thing guys and ruin vidyas.Peace!TL;DR: Perfect game for all CoD fans. Only problem is you can't zoom with AK, but you'll get used to it, I promise.			"

												It is an improved Counter-Strike over Source, but there are a large number of problems.

												No... just no. I love this game, it's an unique and fun concept, but I'm giving it a thumbs down.I used to play this game quite a lot, and I am so glad I stopped. This game used to be fun, until skins happened. That's when all hell broke loose, the game rose in popularity, and everyone in the world started playing it. It was cheap and runs well on any system, so you don't really need anything special to hop in and start playing. This usually attracts idiots and kids. Since then they've been flooding the game and made it pure awful. Not just is the matchmaking system broken and the community is trash, there are countless cheaters and smurfs. Oh, you wanted to play one game without constant unbalance? Well, you're in the wrong place. The community is toxic, rude and overly narcissistic. Cheaters, while being as blatant as possible have the audacity to♥♥♥♥♥♥talk when it's very obvious what is going on. Wanting to kick you because you decide to save or make one single mistake. When you ask to get kicked for having to go or whatnot, nobody gives a ♥♥♥♥, and you're doomed with your ban. Make ONE small mistake like accidentically flicking your mouse and boom, kicked. The smurfers are stealing kills and ruining the game, everytime I play with one I'm just planting the bomb while he gets aces and if I'm lucky I get to kill one player per second round or so. When there's a hacker on my team and I insist to kick him, my teammates give two ♥♥♥♥♥ and won't kick him for the sake of winning. When he's on the other team, they trash talk us blabbering about how he's just a good smurf. My♥♥♥♥♥ Also, VAC and overwatch ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. I see hackers everyday, and VAC takes it sweet♥♥♥♥♥time and lets them ruin the game for as many players as possible before they get banned, on which they create a new account to continue cheating. Oh, and the game costs absolutely nothing. Don't even let me begin with knives, ♥♥♥♥ing $300 for a knife? I do agree in the skins looking cool and all that but seriously, why not spend that money on upgrading your computer so you can admire your knives in better quality? And the case unboxing is ridiculous, I cannot count how many Negevs I have gotten from spending $50 on cases. On top of that, the matchmaking always puts me with 12 year olds. I'm sick of kids saying ""fokk yau bish"" in the worst accent possible. The workshop is also horrible, there's nothing but ugly AWPs, AKs and M4s. Most skins doesn't even have a purple variant, and I honestly don't see why there are 6 covert AWPs and 0 covert famases.I also want to mention the community in general, especially the subreddit, wihch used to be a nice place to talk about this game and share cool stuff. Now it's just a circlejerk full of memes and stream highlights. No other community on reddit exchanges as many downvotes as /r/globaloffensive.Overall?+Great gameplay+Splendid performace and optimization+Interesting game modes+Competetive can both be fun and tense-Toxic community-Constant smurfers & cheaters-Unstable matchmaking-Unfair cooldown system-Ridiculous anticheat3/10. I do however recommend Rainbow 6: Siege,quite frankly it's totally worth it. I've had way more fun playing that game. At least it has an anticheat system that works, and graphics that don't cut your eyes. It's like CS:GO but for functional adultsIf you read this wall of text, and were browsing negative reviews to begin with, that means you must be smart. Please don't play this game. Sell your skins and buy something useful.			"

It's a little hard to adapt if you come from games like Battlefield or CoD because of the recoil and no sights, but if you are dedicated, you can master it in no time. If you are a fan of shooters, you MUST play this game... but warning: it'll be addicting as hell.			"

Posted: December 1, 2015
												Well hi and thanks for stopping by.After over 1000 hours of gameplay and reaching the LEM rank i consider myself expierenced player of CS:GO.If you are thinking about buying this game, you might find this review helpfull.What to start with... ? Surely if you are looking for highly competetive game, this is for you. You can compete with other players, and unlike in for example MOBA games, winning 1v5 is always an option. Beacouse this is the game where your personal skill matters.But thats not the most important thing. This game teaches you teamwork, of course if you are Scream's son you can just solo win every round, but its not the goal of the game. If you solo que in competetive, you will be put in a random game with 4 random people on your team, and 5 random people in the enemy team. They can be different nationaliy, have different characters and react to things differently. But for the time of the game, 4 of your teammates are you best friends. You are supposed to watch their back, coordinate tactics to execute best situations for winning a round and communicate as much as possible.Of course you can have a bad day, and meet 4 people that will not speak your language, will have a bad day as well and will try to grief you and loose the game on purpose. But thats just a rare percentage of my personal experience. You need to always stay positive and calm, and so will your team do.When it comes to game mechanics. CS:GO isnt very complicated, but its very original compared to other FPS games. You are aiming your crosshair at a guy, holding that left mouse button like there is no tomorrow, but you are still not hitting ? Try chilling out a bit and just tapping that mouse. Dont run when you shoot, stop, aim up, fire. Its the way to go in CS. You will get frustrated a lot, you will curse, throw your screen out of your window, but dont worry: When you master the game, there is no better feeling than headshoting an awper with a deagle, trust me.I mentioned a deagle... but there is a high variety of weapons in this game. Pistoles different for certain situations. Shotguns, SMGs, Rifles. You can even have your own Light Machine Gun ! But choose the negev, since m249 is worthless. Always felt MLG quickscope power in your veins ? Buy an AWP and the power of one shot kill (Unless you hit in the legs). Or if you are poor, just buy yourself a SSG08 and go for those tasty headshots. But to be completely honest, gun you will need to master at the first place will be AK47. If you managed to learn the spray pattern, the long range potential and the power of one shot headshot (To compare, no other rifle has that power... well except the negev and the deagle, but those are not guns you will mainly play) you should be good to go to play competetive.Competetive ? But are there any other game modes ? Yes of course. You have very old and popular arms race, where everyone shoot each other to level up the guns and in the end kill someone with a golden knife. You get the demolition. Something like competetive, but you are not allowed to buy guns, you level them up instead every round, if you get a kill. We have a deatchmatch where you can practice and warm up (And I reccomend starting the game with this), you also get the most famous :Casual. Full of unranked, new players, sometimes bored globals, but mostly people playing cs:go for fun, not for rank.Are there any other gamemodes ? This seems boring. Of course there are plenty of community servers allowing you to play Battle Royale, Deathruns, Bhop servers, Surfs, Hide n Seek, Zombie modes and A LOT other cool stuff that myself havent managed to discover yet.But wait, if the game seems that cool, there must be a catch to this. And yes there is. If you dont know russian... oh poor soul, wish you luck, since you will be yelled at a lot. You can also meet cheaters, obvious ones that just spinbot around killing you through 10 walls to boost the rank of some noob paying for it, or you can meet trying to boost themselfes with a slight aim assistance or bhop scripts, but its barely noticable. I rarely meet cheaters, and regulary fulfill my duty as part of the Overwatch.Overwatch ? What is this ? Its a system implemented in the game allowing you as a player to watch a demo of a game, where somebody got reported. And the person that got reported is the POV you will see. Its completely anonymus, but also helps catching people that somehow avoid the VAC system. But dont think you will get access to it easily, takes some time.Last thing i wanted to mention are... skins. And holy♥♥♥♥♥♥this like csgo has its own economy. For money you buy keys, for keys you trade skins, for skins you get skins. Since if you have skins, you must be a pro player, right ? Thats silly, but some of the skins used in game cost over 10k $ and its not a joke. You can loose money opening cases, you can get yourself this kinky knife skin you always wanted. But dont get addicted to it, since me myself spent way more money on the skins than I wanted. Well... what can I say10/10Looking forward to playing more.			"

												Don't...even...bother... not picking up this game! This game has changed my life completely. I'm now sober (6 months! I know, still keeping my fingers crossed, because of my relapse last year), and I'm also off Heroin. Last year was a difficult year for me, I was diagnosed with testicular cancer, something about the way I rest my laptop on my left testicle that managed to cause internal bleeding. Ever since I picked up CS:Go a few months ago, I've stopped resting my laptop on my testicles, instead I've been resting my testicles on my laptop. I thank the developers of this game for creating a masterpiece, and creating a beacon of hope for when I needed it the most.Graphics:8/10Audio: 7/10Gameplay:9/10Life Changing experience: 9001/10 (Thats over 9000!)Thank you source team for bringing me Counter-Strike: GO			"

												Having been connected to the Counter-Strike community since the beginning, I feel a review for Global Offensive is necessary. As a fan of the genre this game feels like a revitalized classic with some great improvements and additions borrowed from other Valve games. After more than a decade of the same FPS Dust 2 action, the weapon cases, skins, and community maps included via the Workshop pump new life into the genre and bring me back to the heyday of Counter-Strike beta, before Steam even existed... but with a whole lot more value. I won't touch on any negative aspects because I could nitpick and complain about small things that really don't impact the experience.Overall it's a fun game with some modern functionality that adds to the play style. If you were ever a fan of the original games through Counter-Strike: Source, you should definitely check this out.			"

So long, my good friend, so long... I will miss you terribly.Before I begin, allow me to say that I reached GNM from GN2 in one week and I was playing with MG1 players until my last game.After a couple of years playing, I have no other choice but to hang my AK and M4 on the wall, and unistall this game that entertained me like few ever did, while not recommending it to anyone at the same time.Why is that, you may ask? Allow me to keep you busy for some of your precious time to elaborate.Until a few years ago, this game was one of the best tactical FPS you would find out there. It was fun, rewarding, and filled the gap between casual gamers and gamers that where seeking a bigger challenge. Of course, there where the usual trolls, hackers, smurfs, flamers, but they where merely the minority. Most teammates where good people to play with and made you enjoy your time spent bombing or defending sites.And this year, 2016, not only many celebrities died, but also the fun this game once offered.Now, it's impossible to play competitive without a team of friends you know that can play well. And for a player like me, that enjoys a little bit of solitude now and then and testing his own powers alone by going solo, that means one thing: Either play always with others, or lose everything you worked for.Playing with others is not a bad thing, don't get me wrong. I already explained why I enjoy some alone time every now and then though. But playing with others means I don't get to play when I want, or reschedule other games and free times for the sake of competitive.It turns into something like a job, full of schedules, stress, pressure and complete lack of amusement.To top it off, the game's players can be expressed in these categories:Casuals: your usual, run-of-the-mill players that team up with a friend or two, or they even may go alone.Premades: Most CSGO players are going in as teams. But, if you are unlucky and bump to a 4 man premade team, you are screwed in most times. Your every mistake will be exploited and become a reason for your team to flame you hard, or even kick you. Very rarely premades will make you feel like an actual part of the team (and these players are worth adding to your friend list).Smurfs: I like to call them the best players the Bane of Global Offensive. Smurfs ruined this game more than anyone. Being assigned against/with players that are, in reality, way high above your skill means you don't get to improve, you won't make any progress in rising through the ranks, and if you play against them, it's almost certain you have already lost.Then you have cheaters that can take on entire hordes of you and your teammates alone. More fun lost.Overwatch is not doing much to punish cheaters and despite VAC, people still cheat with, you guessed it right, smurf accountsIn other words, it's pointless to try playing competitive with the player base being such a fake one this period.Hence, I quit until one day I hear this game is getting back on the right track with fewer smurfs and cheaters. And I strongly recommend not to buy it, or at least stay as far away from competitive as possible.SPOILER ALERT: never open cases, sell them insteadRATING:Gameplay: 8/10 (non-competitive) 3/10 (competitive)Presentation: 8/10Enjoyment (replacing story): 7/10 (non-competitive) 2/10(competitive)Unique Factor: Community: 3.5/10OVERALL: 6.6/10 (non-competitive) 4.1/10 (competitive) "

												Once again, Valve never fails to deliver an epic title such as Counter Strike. For years, the Counter Strike community was divided into two titles: Counter Strike: 1.6 and Counter Strike: Source. But now thanks to Valve's latest Counter Strike adition, we can finally bring back the family all together. The addition of skins are all bonuses that make Counter Strike: Global Offensive even more enjoyable, following Team Fortress 2's hat and drop system. The money being used for E-sports for the best to take place in. The competitive rank system that finally matches players equally based in terms of skill and tactic, as well as giving you the prestige for winning. The game is not perfect, but then again no game is. But what seperates most games from this one is the fact that the beloved developers of Hidden Path Entertainment are always listening to the fans while working together with the top players to try to achieve the perfect gameplay (although there are many features that could be similar to DOTA 2 to make it even better, but Valve will learn soon). Thanks to this game more and more people are joining the community of this game and we should all work so that this game, or should I say franchise becomes the best First Person Shooter series EVER!

												I've had this game since Operation Bloodhound and I still don't how to explain this game, except with the few words: plain fun. I have had a lot of great moments in the game, including meeting many of the people I know today. The controls are orderly, the look is clean. Though the community may be generally cancerous, I have meet and seen people who aren't.The fact that operations are also optional,, also is very nice, because unlike other shooters, this game still allows you to enjoy the maps without the pass.And the developers, whom are some of the best listeners ever, attending to (almost) every bug and detail, and constantly updating the game.I definitely will play more in the future with no plan on stopping.

												No matter what I put here people are going to vote it down but for those that care, been playing the game for about a year and a half. The game only gets updated for new skins and knives. If it ever gets updated for anything it's because it's game breaking or a major complaint and even then it takes forever. IE the CZ75, a pistol, was more powerful than the rifles for awhile and it took them over half a year to actually fix it and even then they didn't test it and had to update it again to properly fix it.The game was updated more to actually improve the game when it peaked at 20k playing per day.

												I have met all kind of adversaries, from noobs playing by the right arrows to professional ones.Valve has done an amazing job creating and developing the game, but at the same time they p1$$ed on all their work. I believe it's all business, and it's all for money.Many players are banned because they cheat and are forced to buy the game again.And people who don't cheat need to switch the matchmaking to Faceit, Esea, etc.VAC is extremely weak. Anybody can cheat!.I have reported cheaters on support.steampowered.com and no one replied.I bookmarked the steamid of the suspect players to see when they get Overwatch or VAC but aren't banned because they play 1 game a day so they won't get into the overwatch session and they can't get banned even when they play with ragebot. Reports on the profiles and tickets are useless. I am now “training” against cheaters because I have no choice. I win/lose being able to maintain myself in Global Elite.I don’t think there’s a match without me facing at least one cheater.I came to the conclusion that Faceit has a really good Anti-Cheat, but it's frustrating that Valve refused to secure the game better against cheaters.I feel like I play on Faceit for nothing. I can abandon any match because I don’t care, I have nothing to lose, nothing motivates me.I really want Valve to secure the game and to eliminate the cheaters. It would be a much better game.CS:GO could be the best game in the world if they would think about the community and if this wouldn't be only about money and people buying the game. I understand every game has cheaters, but if you really have the resources to stop them, why not? They created this game and instead of being proud of it, they just don't care, they just care about the money. Soon there's going to be matches like cheaters vs cheaters.			"

												On Counter-Strike: Global Offensive since the announcement lay a huge responsibility. After all, the continuation of the legendary series of online shooters , a fan is a vast community will not tolerate the slag or just serednyachkovoy game. Benefit , Valve and not the studio that dares to disappoint their fans. Two years later, the clockwise and 691 held in opposition to the special forces and terrorists , I can proudly say that CS: GO is really failed. Even more than .Before continuing my review , it is worth noting that the only worthwhile game mode and remains to this day a bomb clearance , ie confrontation 5x5 , 30 rounds of 1 min. 45 sec. , In which the attacker must detonate a bomb at certain points , and protection appropriate to allow this to happen. One of the major advantages is the fact that CS: GO this type of game ( with minor changes ) placed in a separate section of the menu called ' competitive mode ' . Introduced a system of titles that helps you find a match according to your skill. In CS 1.6 and CS: Source competitive mode by default absent and was available only on certain servers , specially tuned for this type of game.The gameplay is not changed . Actually , nothing changed and is not required , a familiar mechanic works on hurray . Fixed characteristics of some weapons , something removed, something added to the overall picture it does not have nearly no effect. Shooting became more random, yes. But perhaps the most realistic FPS in the moment. If multiplayer shooter from you wait not fancy graphics and ballistics believable and interesting gameplay, then welcome to the CS: GO.Valve managed to make an almost perfect balance of gaming devices. With proper skill you can neutralize the enemy with a much more powerful weapon . Pistol rounds in CS: GO is not known to sink without a chance and an opportunity to take the round even with poor economies .But the most important advantage is the ratio of Valve to his fans . Almost every week there is a free upgrade , changing the gameplay for the better, in order to achieve a perfect balance . Approximately every six months out extensive additions cost 5-7 dollars with soccer fans cards that are available in the competitive mode. That's not counting skins for weapons that can get special opening drawers. In addition to all Valve maintains its competitive community , sponsoring tournaments large sums . And I am delighted that the number of people playing CS: GO, is increasing every day .But on the other hand it is the community CS was for me the only problem in this game. Because it often turns into a competitive mode into a farce and mutual humiliation. The only solution - only play with friends.Total we have a great continuation of one of the greatest franchises in history. To purchase required if gaming is important to you the gameplay itself . Best multiplayer shooter at this point, in my opinion.- beardATTACK @ fren			"

												One of the worst games i have ever played. I got all the way to LEM and i can say these things about this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game.1: Smurfs. So many that its not even fun anymore. Once you are higher up in the ranks you will encounter at least 1 smurf per game and they will destroy you.2: Hackers are very abundant all throughout the game. You will most likely run into a hacker at the very least once every 10 or so games. If you legit think that there are not many hackers in this game, you are sorely mistaken.3: The community is worse than CoD's community nowadays. They will make ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t arguments about the guns, troll, among other things. It is sad just how low some can go, if you want to see that low, this is the game for it.4: Horrid matchmaking system. I get it, you can only do so much, but from the amount of times I have been paired up with people i should not have, or been put into russians servers, its just stupid.5: Boosting. So many horrible players have been boosted by their friends, or hackers, or both into the high ranks. Then when you play with them they are worse than a bot for your team. 6: 64 Tick servers and horrible hit reg problems. The servers are not good, you will encounter many times when you saw your bullet go through the person you were shooting at simply because what your client saw, and the server saw, are two different things. For a fast paced shooter such as csgo, that is very very bad.All in all csgo was fun, i enjoyed it for a time. That time has long since past. This game could be one of the best of its kind if somebody showed it some proper TLC. Fixed up VAC, upgraded the servers. Helped prevent smurfing to some extent. Now im not somebody with their head in the clouds thinking that everything in this game could be fixed and it would be a perfect game. No, that is not realistic, some of the problems do need fixing though. Maybe one day Valve will care enough to solve them, but i find that to be highly doubtful. If you are looking to become angry, get violent with strangers and friends alike, want to have a stroke and lose your hair through either stress or you pulling it out yourself, this is the game for you.Edit:As of 3/29/2016 there are even more hackers than before. Wallers are in about every 1 in 3 games. Most of them don't even bother hiding it that well due to bans being so avoidable in this game. Ever since polyhacks were released to the public people have been walling like crazy. Don't believe me? thats ok go look on m p g h and see the massive hacking community at work.			"

												Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fireConsequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.			"

She was salty so she burned all my clothes but its k because she had a white girl booty... Anyways my wife left me, I sold my house, and am depressed.. but its ok because i bought a dragonlore, a howl, and a doppler factory new butterfly knife that i bought instead of paying for my house.  Moral of the story is, this game is trash in a good way.  Im running out of d0sh, I might have to turn into a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ just so I can supply my addiction.  Turns out prostitution isnt that bad, I mean, its very unsanitary but over all its ez $$.  Just spent more than 100 dollars on cases... got almost all blues and a couple purples.

												I'll just be straight-forward with this; this game is for ones who enjoy FPS, Counter-Strike games, and PvP. If you are one that doesnt enjoy those things then this game isn't for you. You will be faced with a lot of frustration and will regret purchasing this game. Now for those that do enjoy those things stated before, this game has better graphics than the previous CS games, intense competitive FPS matches, remakes of nostaligic classic CS maps, and new fun casual game modes like arms race. So yes, I will recommend this game, for those that love FPS.			"

												Well I have 200+ hours on this game, and I don't know why but hey, here's a review.Pros:+Has the option of competitive+Fairly Balanced+No Game Changing items+Fair Economy (Skins and Items)+Easy to setup (Lobbies with Friends, Custom Crosshairs/Changing Viewmodels)+No way to gain an advantage (Except Skill)+Good Anti-Cheat and Overwatch+Teamwork is neededCons:-Very Toxic, occasionally helpful, community. (Full of Trolls, Ragers, ect.)-Some weapons can be used so abusely and unskillful as it makes the game unfair. (P90)Edit: This can be combatted by approaching the P90 users from a position that gives you an advantage. Credit goes to Bunnikinz! Thanks for the advice!Neutrals:(Depending on how you see it, it can be viewed as a pro or a con)=If you disconnect from a competitive match, you have 3 minutes to get back in or you cannot get back in even if you do get back on. (One of my friends computer bluescreens occasionally during comp and his reboot time isn't enough to get back on time)=Ranking System, the ranking system prevents smurfs from appearing as often but gives the new player a huge grind before being able to play competitive. (Smurf = A skilled player, usually of the ranks Distinguished Master Guardian - Global Elite, who makes a new account to play with lower skilled players often ruining the game for the opposing team.) Also as you move higher in the ranks you will find more hackers, especially in Supreme First Class and Global Elite games. What most players do is go on ESEA servers where their Anti-cheat is a bit better than Valves.Final Verdict: 9/10 although the game is really good it does has somethings I'd like improved.What I'd like to be improved that can be fixed:+Report System, As much as the VAC system is good, it's always going to be flawed as it won't be able to detect a hacker 100%. Valve is trying to fix this with Overwatch, a system of which hand-picked players (usually high ranked and have many hours in the game) review a demo that is recorded of the game of whom is reported from and votes on whether the suspect is either hacking/greifing or not. What most youtubers who record Overwatch and people who use Overwatch want, they want to see what the suspect is reported for as when reporting someone you're given three options: Hacking, Greifing, or Other. This allows the reviewer to look out for what is the player is reported for making it justifiably easier and more accurate.Note: As I put more hours into this game it will advance, so this review will be edited in the future for it to be more accurate.

												Do not buy this game. Sorry for anyone who likes this quickly thrown together peice of♥♥♥♥♥♥but in my personal opinion it's a crap. 75% of your deaths will not make sence meaning wallbang through none penetrable walls, cross map no scopes through solid objects, enemys constantly knowing your location, spraying down enemys at extremely close range 50% of the time dosent kill them no matter if you unload a mag or not, Shotguns do not kill at point blank but snipers instant kill you on a leg or toe shot, Feels like the game is on constant headshots only with most weapons. I appologies for i sincerly HATE this game and i do not recommend it to anyone nor to my worst enemys.It's torture.			"

												Well, this game is amazing, and is very different from the past Counter Strikes. Graphics have improved alot, which I believe why many people love games because of their graphics. (Graphics aren't everything). As of the past Counter strikes, you would have to find a server with the particular gamemode that you want. (Arms race, Deathmatch etc etc) In CS-GO You wont have to worry about that, they have different gamemodes where you could actually choose to play in besides finding a server that has it. I have also notice that this is fairly alittle bit easier than any of the other counter strikes, probably since they reduce the recoil a bit? But either way, tap firing is always the key.Also many Unique Features they have added in this game. First off, there are the skins. Many people disliked this idea since they probably thought CS-GO would be ""like"" Call Of Duty. Well, adding skins doesn't really mean anything, it just makes you be able to battle in style. Not to also mention offline mode. Offline mode is basically playing with bots. Now, some Counter-Strikes did have bots such as Counter Strike Source, but I just thought it was nice that they would add ""bots mode"" back. Counter Strike Global Offensive is way different from any other FPS (First Person Shooter). It's much harder and takes a bunch of skills seeing the fact that many players are already pros. So, that's why I play Offline mode. If I were to rate this game out of 10, I'll probably give it a 7.5/10			"

												Literally the worst game that ever came out. If you aren't completely sadistic and have some self respect you just keep your ♥♥♥♥ing fingers away from this terrible game. You're gonna start at the bottom of the rank lists playing against people with over 40'000 hours who literally just bought a new account to ♥♥♥♥ you up and tell you how homophobical they are, or how they banged your mum and dad and sister and brother last night. Ideally, you're gonna become better, actually you won't, but you will be sometimes carried so hard through your games that you'll manage to get to some decent ranks, where you'll get stomped because you play against people who sacrificed their girlfriends for pure reaction time and insanely inhuman skills. Talking and having fun at this stage is basically impossible, since you will have to drop down everything that might even slightly decrease your attention, e.g: Your baby, your girlfriend, the phone, the doorbell, everything. After 500 hours you'll get to the elo hell, Legendary Eagle Master, where you are gonna face off exact copies of KennyS, ApeX, olofmeister and more. The insults at this stage of the game become so heavy, that you won't be able to sleep for weeks. After a few months of playing, asking yourself WHY you play this game, you're gonna get out of LEM and become SMFC and then GE. Now you're the one whos stomping. HA! JOKE! You'll now face a ♥♥♥♥ing wallhacker or aimbotter every ♥♥♥♥ing round, people who literally spend their whole childhood playing this game since Half Life was announced, people who became one with their PC. And the worst of all...you're still going to play this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Whatever, I'm off playing a round.			"

												I probably won't have a popular opinion here but it is how I feel none the less, Its a really good game for some people. I actually don't particularly enjoy it as much anymore, though I still play it. The community, in my experience, very skilled, somewhat (very) salty and it makes it a very difficult/frustrating game to get in to seeing I'm forever gonna be a noob. I can say that CS:GO was the best purchase of any game I made and I've spent way too much money on it to just stop, Kidding I regret everything. Seriously.. don't buy this game. :)			"

												The game itself : good.The community : the worst. Your teammates are actually your ennemies. And while the griefers, trolls and smurfs are annoying they can somehow be dealt with. The biggest problem is that the higher up the ranks you go, the bigger the egos get. Insecure manchildren then turn into full on bullies making solo queue unbearable to play. The only solution is to somehow make friends and play with the decent people, which requires planning, 4 people of your own rank with the same availability, and doesn't then allow you to play ""casually"" in competitive mode.

												UPDATE 18/02/2017: New insight on the game. You can read my old review below.Since my last review, which was posted in July last year, not much really changed. Just some 'small touches' by the devs, you know - they added sprays to the game, so now instead of having a small chance to drop a half-decent weapon skin you could sell on market for some profit you now have an even smaller one, with sprays dominating the drop table. And, yeah, they're cheap as hell. So if you wanted to profit out of this game, I wish you luck.Other than that, they introduced skinnable gloves. So yeah, with knives being the past 'most expensive' skins in the game, now you have gloves, which are even rarer. As you can probably tell, Valve's moneygrab tactics are blooming.They recently announced that they're working on a remake to de_dust2. Great to see they're focusing on the most important things that should be fixed, instead of wasting their time with a map revamp </sarcasm>.What about the matchmaking? Glad you asked. Prime system doesn't do much, as people can register with throwaway phone numbers and still be queued for Prime. Which means that it doesn't help jack. If you queue without Prime, however, your chance of encountering a cheater rises up to approx. 95%. Not sure who still uses Overwatch, but that doesn't seem to help. Reporting people wields results after long periods of time, or not at all. I wouldn't be surprised if at this rate Valve partnered up with cheat providers for more profit, since hacking in this game is easier than stealing a kid's candy... and seems it still goes about unpunished.And, almost forgot, they introduced public lobbies. For the first few weeks it was what you'd expect, random people jumping on your lobby and starting to screech autistically. Now? Hey, now you have like 7-9 bots instajoining your lobbies that you can't kick.So, yeah. Still broken, and Valve still doesn't listen. Cause, you know. MONEY <3If you like shooters or Counter-Strike in general, do yourself a favor and play the good old 1.6 or Source. Global Offensive promised to deliver an upgraded experience of those good shooters, but, as it is universally known, they stopped at promises only. While the improved mechanics of the game and the indulging competitive mode are welcome additions, if you came for those reasons, well... you will be disappointed.This game had a rough start, and I'm fairly sure you know the story. It wasn't too well introduced, hit near-rock bottom and then scored a 'miraculous' revival thanks to the skins update. That's when the devs really cared for the game, and tried to provide as much as they could so that the players liked it.Sadly however, they stopped as soon as the downfall of the game was no longer imminent, as at this point it seems almost absurd to consider the game as successful as CS:GO dying out in the foreseeable future. And that's exactly why it's no longer as good - the game is plagued by hackers and smurfs, essentially destroying the pure pleasure of defeating an enemy in close quarters, scoring a faraway headshot with a pistol or winning a clutch. Surely, those feelings are quite alright - but they are buried really fast upon encountering somebody who's not abiding by the rules.VAC is no use, devs haven't devised a way to avoid matchmaking you against a smurf, the greatly promoted Overwatch system stopped bringing relief after a while and Prime Matchmaking doesn't look promising either. Competitive games we all enjoy playing are now a lottery - you either get a complete one-sided slaughterfest thanks to unfair play, or finally get a room to breathe and play a single well-fought game, with a chance of somebody joking around and killing the pleasure yet again.The icing on the cake is, as I already mentioned, the skin system. Instead of focusing more on the security so that the game is actually playable, we're getting balance patches so that the pros can feel a little different during tournaments, new cases to milk the money out of twelve year olds' parents and more useless stuff. In short... not recommended.tl;dr: the game is STILL full of hackers, smurfs, trolls and raging kids who 'f*ck your mother'. It kills every little bit of enjoyment and at this stage, I wouldn't recommend buying it... maybe when valve drops another sale and starts caring for our enjoyment and not our money for once.			"

												I am here to tell a spactacular tale. A tale so exciting, Ted Cruz dropped out of the election! Time to begin.Our tale begins in the later months of 2014 maybe even going in to 2015. I was playing Garry's Mod, when I saw my friends playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. They told me it was good, fun, tactical, good shooting mechanics, good servers, good community, good graphics, and EVEN BEST GAME N/A! Maybe a day after, I went to my local Walgreens and got myself a $20 Steam card. I got home, typed the code in, and......... made the worst mistake of my life. I hit the purchase button for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and I had no idea what I was getting in to. Everything my friends said,good, fun, tactical, good shooting mechanics, good servers, good community, good graphics, were lies. After wasteing 20 sum hours of griding casual games, I was rank 3 and ready to play my first competitive match with my friends. 10 games past, I got my rank, Silver Elite Master. My friends were gold nova and we continued to play, The tale now goes dark. After 20 games, I have seen about everything, Hackers on every server, Servers sucking, Swears at me, SALT, PEPPER, SAYING I SUCK MY GRANDPA's FAT CHICKEN, DAMN I HEARD IT ALL. No shooting mechanics, no good graphics, WORST COMMUNITY EVER, horrible servers, litte to none anti cheat (literally cheaters every other match), AND SALT SALT SALT SALT! Be warned, by clicking purchase, you are sigining a contract with satan. BE WARNED. Do not purchase no matter what anyone says! Lock your ears! Lock your bank account! Do Not Buy This Game!You sir, have been warned.Love you,GOD DERPY "

												Well, I could say a lot about Global Offensive.I had bought it in August, but after 40 minutes playing straight I didn't support anymore and simply refund the game. After much insistence of my friends, I get the game again and so, I noticed the reason why I gave a ""rage quit"" previously.For newbs who never had or just like me, long time since had contact with a Counter Strike, I recommend start playing in casual mode. When I bought it for the first time I fell directly in MM and for those starting / re-starting, that is asking to be stressed and think the game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I would say casual is the closest thing to our old&good CS 1.6.Valve make a incredible work upgrading Counter-Strike, the whole system of enemy ""steps"" has been improved considerably, which you can detect by focusing on radar, not to mention the new modes like ""Weapon Race"" which is a lot of fun though challenging.Anyway, said too much. The game is very good indeed and with friends the fun is guaranteed. Probably 90% of Steam has CSGO, will not be difficult for you to find friends to play. 10/10			"

												Hepimiz küçüklüğümüzde Counter Strike oyunlarından birini muhakkak oynamışızdır, Counter'ın yenilenen bu sürümünde Silah Yarışı başta olmak üzere Ölüm Oyunu, Rekabetçi vb gibi modlar var bunlar ana olanlar. Rekabetçi modunda bildiğimiz bomba kurup veya diğer takımın tüm üyelerini öldürme olayı var, ama sonunda size güzel hediyeler verebiliyor, ve arkadaşlarınızla takım oluşturup rekabetçide diğerlerine karşı yarışabiliyorsunuz. Oyunun marketi de değerli olabiliyor, örneğin rekabetçiden kazandığım bir silah şu an CS GO'nun pazarında 5 dolara tekabül ediyor. Eğer şansınız iyiyse gelen silahların bazılarını kullanıp bazılarını değerlendirerek oyunun tadını çıkarabilirsiniz. Silah Yarışında ise oyundaki tüm silahlarını kullanarak bıçağa doğru ilerliyorsunuz ve verilen her silahla bir kişi öldürmeniz gerekiyor o silahla bir kişi öldürdüğünüzde diğer silaha geçiyorsunuz ve bu bıçağa kadar böyle gidiyor, bıçakta ise en son öldürdüğünüzde modu tamamlamış oluyorsunuz.

												I thank TrulyRazor for buying this for me a long time ago -- I insisted to him that I would not play it. Seems I was wrong.Most around me have always known me for, perhaps not absolutely hating, but at the very least showing some amount of contempt and disdain for all things Counter-Strike. I should address this before talking about why the game has value. One component of my dislike was cured by playing it, as I knew it would. I simply did not understand the game, most of the mechanics seemed counter-intuitive and frustrating. This changed as I played and came to understand the game -- I expected that.The other element of my dislike for Counter-Strike in general has remained unchanged. The elitism of its players and the toxic, cancerous nature of the community itself. The elitism comes in the form of treating Counter-Strike as if it were above other shooters that do not aim to do what it does. Call of Duty, with its fun, arcade shooting must be seen as garbage, and Halo with its slower-paced shooting with sci-fi shields/weapons/tech must also be bad, for it is different. Battlefield too, not having recoil patterns that take months to completely memorize, is clearly for the trash heap. Inane comments like these come from a simple ignorance about different things serving different purposes, but it is obnoxious nonetheless.The cancerous community is really just that, cancerous. Many talk of Russians in silver matchmaking, I have not encountered this. I have however, encountered toxic, alpha-male types who yell, complain, and belittle others -- who put down their teammates, make them feel like crap, etc. I have encountered all possible types of cringy weeaboos, bronies, and people who recite old memes in deathmatch lobbies and think they're funny. People who make the lamest, overused jokes and think it's hilarious, people who just scream and make noises for shock value. Standard fare for most online shooters but CSGO has a LOT of this.So, yeah, this game has one of the worst communities out there. It's true. It doesn't, however, make the game wholly bad.On to why the game is good.The game does have a very steep learning curve. Slowly coming to understand the way the game works, the importance of each part is satisfying. As you learn positioning, grenade throws, crosshair placement, recoil patterns, and so on you can feel yourself getting better at the game. Not trying very hard and not understanding either immediately ranked me at Silver III when I started. The slow process of getting better and rising through the ranks is immensely satisfying and enjoyable -- I'm now Legendary Eagle (SMFC now). It taught me a lot of patience and willingness to push on even when frustrated. While most of the maps are CT-sided, they are all designed with a great deal of balance in mind. The weapons too, their costs, their recoil, each having drawbacks, give balance to the game.All the elements combined -- the economy, the guns, the maps, positioning, timing, recoil, grenade throws, sound, etc -- and you get a very tense, balanced shooter. There are very few situations where it could not go either way -- if skill levels are equal, I am not claiming silvers have much chance against high-level smurfs. Speaking generally, equally matched players in an average game have an equal chance to win and things can quickly turn around for the whole game  or for any single round if one smart player knows what's going on.I know it's easy to be cynical about bad teammates or people who don't listen, but that's not really got to do with the quality of the game, I'm simply talking about how it should play out ideally.A good game of Counter-Strike in its ideal form is something highly enjoyable -- when teammates are listening, when plays work, when headshots connect, when the other team stands at least some chance, then the game is fantastic to play. It is highly demanding of you, asking disciplined patience, focus, and consistency, but also highly satisfying, granting deserved victory, ranking up, and greater confidence as you become better. There are few other games like it, or that at least, provide a similar experience.I would recommend you play with friends, granted that you have friends you can trust to listen to you, take feedback, and try hard enough to improve with you. Besides the fact that you'll have dependable people to play with, having others to complain about the game with, to share your losses and your gains definitely keeps you sane when the game is at its most frustrating. You learn about the game together, get better together, you point out eachother's flaws and learn from their strengths -- it is, again, much more enjoyable and will also allow you to tolerate the game longer, as you'll be going through the journey with others rather than alone.It is not, honestly, a game for everyone. If you are willing to put effort into this game then you'll be rewarded. If you're a long time player and go into it every day understanding you still have a lot more to learn and discover, then again, you'll be rewarded. (I have found though that, going into ANYTHING with a renewed sense of wonder and willingness to learn grants a better experience.)I recommend this game for any and all who can put in the effort, change their play, practice consistently, learn, and expect progress to come slowly. If instant gratification is your thing, don't play this.Oh yeah, there's also the usual TF2-style item hunt for weapon skins and cases in case you're interested in wasting a lot of money -- not at all implying I am not guilty in this either.So give the game a try, just understand what you're getting into.

												No! Jist, no. Now, you may ask, after 1600hrs of CS:GO, why I don't recommend this game? It's obvious that is not about the gameplay. CS:GO as any of the CS games has, one of the most addictive and challenging gameplay ever. Technically the game is perfect: good graphics, fast respond updates to bugs and problems. One of the best anti-cheat systems in the world. Yep, better than Blizzard's. (You may not agree with the sentence about the anti-cheats, but I will explain this down.) And, even the market for ""goods"" and DLCs is perfect. It's focused on the older and more experienced players. Lots of ""skins"" for the new players and new ""operations""(maps) for the older players. The more you play, the better this game becomes. Like I said, technically perfect on any aspect. The problem comes form the game community. You may agree with, that the most of the players in this game are 12 years old kids with urgent desire to sleep with your mother. And, after few hours with the game you will become a polyglot linguist, mostly in slavic phiology (Polish, Russian). But this aren't the main problem. The problem is in the COMPLETE tolerance, the COMPLETE ignorance and the COMPLETE lack of knowledge from the community, about the CHEATERS. This game possess one of the most complete anti-cheat systems. It covers every aspect of the game: VAC- automatic anti-cheat program, Overwatch system for precise observation. This two programs are in constant communication with the main game and the ""Matchmaking system""- so, all of the cheaters to end playing against each other and to get banned. But, ...BUT... This system relys on, the ""willingness"" of this community to use this system, to deal with the cheaters. Unfortunately, by this complete negligence the system is doing more damage to the people who are willing to help by using it. Rather than to the cheaters.If you are ""new"" to the game. My advice is to skip this game and don't start it.			"

												Well, what can I say.... Counter-Strike Global Offensive is basically the game I have played the most, yet the game that I hate the most.I really like the straightforward play of the game, a lot of different stuff you can learn in it, yet a lot of different stuff you can spend your money on. CS:GO is a very decent game with a lot of decent features, but unfortunately ruined by its own community. I can see that on Valve's end, they're always trying to improve things in this game by releasing updates and stuff, but the actual reason of me to play this, no... the actual reason for people to play games is to have fun. Roughly more than half of the community is either toxic, or won't treat you well like the people they meet in real life. With hackers sometimes ruining the fun of your game, people screaming at you for failing, and even a children not respecting you as an adult, I honestly think that goal is no longer achieveable. To be quite frankly, the last time I truly had fun in this game is when I was doing Wildfire co-op missions with my classmate last year, but with how Valve is pushing glove update and other miscellaneous ones instead, I don't think I'm going to play this often in the future.If you're just a casual and laid-back type of player that enjoy gaming at your own pace, I don't recommend investing your time into this, unless you have friends who you can play with all the time.Oh, and if 30fps is the highest you can get, getting into global is only in your dream, baby.

 For Those Who Wants To Learn Seriously  First of all, the game respects to the original Counter-Strike soul. What I mean with that; Close combats, mid-range combats, long combats, auido, personolized CFG, grenade training, team-work, using communications are still have great affects on the gameplay.   So far what has changed? First, graphics and phsycs has changed. Weapons has changed, community has changed, players has changed, match-making has changed. I will explain everything what i mean by those but first things first. For old players from the times of 1.5 or 1.6 (or even older) You may difficulties adapting to phsyscs and new gameplay. As I said players has changed, and the teamwork has changed. There will be a lots of people telling you what to do. Why are you flashing, why did you smoke there, how didn't you heard the defuse but believe me you will understand that all after a few hours on the game. With the new ranking system ( I will explain this furter too.) there is much at stake. Your efforts and skills will affect you teammates ranks in competitive mode.  Let's start to explain; Matchmakin Mode (Competitive)5 to 5 serious matchs, instead of an 32 player 16-16 server which people often go crazy run around, rushing CT's. You will experience a real clan match. For example, after you accept the game on Dust 2 if you leave the game you will have a punishment for 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 24 hours, 2 days, 7 days. Same punishments for killing to much teammates or killing a teammate after the spawn.   After you have won 10 games in competitive mode you can see your rank.(Search google for further reading.) Ranking system is a revoulitoun for me. Like in chess you will face with opponents in your same skill level and that also offers a chalenge: To up rank but also there is a risk to de-rank. Ranking system works on different ways and have a lots of different derrivatives. For example winning matches while the opponents have higher ranks then you or having a 37-5 K/D. Believe me ranking system is your friendWeaponsRemeber the times that AK-47, M4A1, AWP, Desert Eagle were over power? Forget it and also say goodbye to a lots of weapons including MP-5 (one of my favs.) Goodbye to scout... Say hello to PP-Bizon, SSG,P250,Nova...With these changes you'll have a very expanded area of weapons to chose, MAG-7 is op in close combat, SSG has its pluses such as you can shoot straight while jumping. five-seven has a great armor penetration CZ-75 is an automatic pistol that you can rush with in an eco round. The reason im telling you all these because you can choose your own weapons considering you style. Are you a rusher? Get your P90 ready 50 bullets, low recoil high fire rate, you are a close-holder, get a mag-7, you are good on sniping and pistols? get your ssg. Options are much better then it was in 1.6 or else.Also do not omit the skins and market. over 100 skins for weapons, 10 different weapon boxes near 30 different collections. Trade up contract, keys, operation bravo-phoenix. Thats not something that I can explain. You need to see it yourself and feel the difference. Audios are better, community updates every second, you can report cheaters, phsycs are nearly awesome then every other fps games. (yes including CoD). Go and get the game, do not wait for price to go down. You can make that money in game with selling weapons on the market for the time being.  14.99$ for this game is like paying 40.000$ for a masseratti. (And masseratti doesnt helps you to make your money back.)Trust me if you are searching for a great fps experience, this is the most exciting game for time being.  "

												I love all Counter-Stirkes, this one is pretty good. Personaly there are so many mechanical flaws that desrupt the whole game all together. This game can become rage inducing to certain extents. One notable flaw is the poor lag compensation and certain match making glitches for Competitive Mode. For the past 2 weeks, this game has been brutal with high pings on every single server I join. I'm getting banned for weeks just for having a poweroutage; some teamates accidentally either walk infront of you fireing a weapon a few times or walking into a HE grenade; and you get a ban/kick for their own fault.I enjoy this game at very few times, but not enough to be worth what it is.

												After 2300 hours of playing and achieving the highest rank in CsGo I think im able to give you a honest review.This game brought me so many good memories and friends. There are alot of people that tell you that this game is ''broken'', full with Russians, trollers etc.I'm going tell you: It is not!After  playing alot of csgo ofcourse I met stupid Russians, stupid selfhish kids and many other problems but thats only in 10% of the games when you play below mg1 level. But it didnt bother me that much, this game will give you alot of good times and will bring you alot of joy, you just need to have the right mindset. Dont give up when there are selfish players, trollers etc. Just let them be and think of all the good things you have had of this game.When I started to play this game my goal was to achieve the highest rank that their is, and let me tell you, it is possible. If you really want to accomplish something you have to go for it, some people just say: ''I get russians every game I cant rank up'' Those people are 9/10 times just bad and cant reach the top so they blame others. Ignore them and test it yourself, find friends to play with and im sure you are going to have a good time. You dont always have to win, you dont have to rage when you lose becauze its going to happen, always look back at this game and think: I had a good time playing it even if I won or lostBesides all this, Cs brings way more then only ''competetive''. Many people seems to forget that there are alot of other gamemodes you can play, Deathrun, Jailbreak, Surf, TTT, Murder, Hide and Seek, Co-op maps with friends, bhop and many many other gamemodes. Their are 1000+ communities out there that will love to have you play on their server with community managers, active admins and friendly players. ALL in ALL: CS:GO is becoming a game that people like to blame, if they lose they blame other things, if they can't rank up they blame things. C'mon guys lets just have a good time playing it. If you cant take it that you ''lose becauze of your teammates'' then just ♥♥♥♥ off and stop telling people that this game is bad.note: English is not my main language.Thanks for reading this review, I hope it helped you.

												So, after 1000 Hours of this game, I know pretty much all I need to know for a review. This game is amazing and all, but there are a couple flaws. I am currently MG1, and it was a long road to get there. I had the troubles, of when I got on a large win streak, I would be on a game I was certain I would rank up, then of course a hacker would have to be on the other team. All we could do was report them, and then get on with our lives. Then, after another long win streak, I was about to rank up when I got Derankers. Of course, all I could do was report them for griefing and move on with my life. Then, there is the factor of constantly versing smurfs. There is a small chance of winning when against a smurf, and it gets on my nerves when there is a whole team of smurfs against just a normal team of my rank. If you can get games with no smurfs, derankers or hackers, this game is amazing and I enjoy everything about it other than what was just mentioned. I give it a 8/10.			"

												Sure it's fun, at first.The game goes from fun to frustrating quickly, the gameplay is rather simple, but that's not the problem.Don't expect a game that is fun at first, also don't expect the game to be fun at all.The problem is how bad competitivie is, it's more fun to do homework than it is to play a game of competitive against a hacker. It doesn't help that the game is only fun less than 50% of the timeInvest your time in something else than this sinkhole. Learn how to code or just do your homework, you will have a better time and you will be more happy in the long run. You shouldn't have to invest 500 hours+ into a game for it to start being fun			"

												Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the newest version of the well known game Counter-Strike.Global Offensive has a lot of different game modes besides of the classic bomb defusal/hostage rescue scenarios.Deathmatch, basically is about getting a lot of kills and dying as few times as possible. You will spawn at random space with your chosen weapons or random ones.In Arms Race you have to get kills with every weapon. The fastest player wins.Demolition can be a Bomb mission or hostage rescue on smaller maps compared to the regular bomb or hostage missions.Competitive is the hardest and most interesting type and is only recommended for advanced players. You have to win a minimum 16 rounds to win the game. This gamemode may take up to 90 minutes. Communication is the key here to win.Counter-Strike: Global Offensive also support ingame items, but it is a purely cosmetic thing.You will also have a chance to support the game by buying special tickets for the so-called ""Operations"". With an operation pass you will get access to newly released competitive maps, new weapon skins and an upgradeable medal.The graphics are much better than Counter Strike Source. The environments are more detailed and the game just looks a whole lot better.Global Offensive is one of the top 10 most played games on Steam right now, so there are plenty of players and servers.The mechanics are different from former Counter-Strike games, like the recoil for each weapon and new weapons like decoy, Molotov, etc. This could be difficulty for veteran players at the beginning. But after a while you can deal with it.Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a definite buy for anyone that is into Counter-Strike. It is definitely worth the regular price of 13,99€.A must have for every Steam user!Sounds 9/10Graphics 9/10Gameplay 10/10Atmosphere 10/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

If this happens just block them and keep playing. Also probably the 30% of players do cheat regularly. Don't be fooled by the amount of hours a players might have. Even the ones with 2k hours do cheat. Also the 90% of player with new account that play good are either smurfers or cheaters(mostly cheaters). All said, have fun.			"

												If you ever wondered where the worst and utter scum of all living things since the origins of this planet is dwelling, search no more. The answer is: In this game, and it's such a high concentration of flaming 8yr olds, trolls, cheaters, leavers, teamkillers and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s it makes me ponder if perhaps we should just sentence everyone playing to death by lethal injection. The world would be a wonderful place. You know, ISIS is actually scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of the CSGO community, they fear them for their complete lack of brains which makes them dangerous enemies: You can't really kill them with headshots or beheadings. If things are well in your life and you desperately want to be depressed and have all that you hold dear destroyed then download this game and after only a few weeks your life will be hell on earth.Not to mention of course, everyone who ever touched this game is the worst racist, sexist and homophobic♥♥♥♥♥♥you can think of, in fact it gets to a point where their stupidity becomes a parody of its own. If your hopes in the human race are not yet lost (which makes me question the content of your skull, honestly), this is the absolute and definite proof that mankind has no place on this or any other planet, and will hopefully wiped out rather sooner than later by a natural catastrophy of some sort or just animals picking up fully-automatic guns and killing every human and ape they can find. A dozen atomic bombs would also do nicely.			"

												Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a first-person shooter and the next generation of Counter-Strike running on updated Source Engine and has many new features added.The gameplay is also has been revamped so even new players can play the game without much difficulty. This means slightly less weapons recoil and no need to buy weapons ammo anymore. There are many new game modes such as deathmatch, arms race and the competitive online match. There's also the new Arms Deal update where each weapons now has many skins which can be acquired when you play on VAC enabled servers in a timed based item drops or by opening a weapons case with certain bought keys. Weapons skins can be used to show off, traded or sold on Steam marketplace. You can even change your weapons name and add some description about it. You can also submit your own weapon skins or maps if you have the creativity so that maybe Valve will add it in the next game update, therefore supporting the game even further.Graphics in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has been vastly improved. Characters model are all fresh new while retaining the same design and faction with some new faction added. The map is upgraded even better to look more realistic than ever. The new Source Engine also made the ragdoll physic effect and many effects feels more realistic. Despite all of the upgraded graphics, the game runs amazingly smooth and optimized and doesn't really need high-end system.Oh, but before you buy this or even play the game, you better be ready to throw yourself into a real hot zone out there, as the community of this game is... well... unforgiving. You either die as a noob or live long enough the get a title hacker.This is yet the best Counter-Strike game where casual and hardcore gamers can play. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

If that isn't enough to make you want to kill yourself, being matched with the daily random Russian per day might throw you off the edge with the three words in English he knows, none of which are helpful. And if you manage it through that hell hole then after those ranks enjoy replacing your peripherals every couple of weeks due to hackers and griefers not to mention the anger management classes you will be taking. Other than that, great game. Would spend all my money on skins/10.			"

												GAMEPLAY 8.6/10   |   COMMUNITY 8.9/10   |   RANKS 3.5/10   |   VAC 2/10 = Total Rating: 7.9/10So many things I want to talk about:GAMEPLAYThis is alot like Counter Strike 1.6 and has so many unique features I enjoy. I'm glad this game didn't come out like Counter Strike: Source which was terrible. This game has intense sound effects that play when the bomb is planted, at the beginning/end of rounds, when you win/lose, and when you get an mvp. The guns and their spray patterns are fun to learn and take alot of time and skill to master which is good (not a cod fan). Like all Source games you can change crosshair, sound settings, video settings, and tons more through the console. The guns feel exciting to hold and shoot. Everytime I pick up an AK47 I feel fireworks going off in my head. This game gets very intense and based on teamwork. If you do not have someone to play I recommend finding someone to play with since alot of people in competitive play aren't always nice.COMMUNITYThe community of Counter Strike is amazing. There still is that 40% of people that like to mess with people and hate just like any other community, but CSGO's community has many coders and other people trying to help VALVE locate bugs and exploits in CSGO which is awesome! They are helping make a better game. CSGO's community also has very talented artists who do skins for the game. Some of the amazing skins to make it in have been the Hyperbeast, Cyrex, Neon Rider, Asiimov, and more! Alot of people love Counter Strike and so many new gaming networks/sub communities have started through Counter Strike. The community also has fun gambling websites where you can gamble skins away on pro games.RANKSThis is a very important part of the game that has been ruined by multiple vac wave bans. After all these people were banned from CSGO everyone started ranking up 2-3 ranks. Most people in their rank should be about 3 ranks lower. Valve needs to fix this! They need to go through and set everyones ranks to unranked, then let people play 5 games to determine their new rank or something. Hopefully one day the horrible rank issue will be fixed.VACThe Valve Anti-Cheat detection on CSGO hacks is terrible. ESEA Client has a better hack detection then Valve. Valve needs to fix this right away!!! There are too many hackers in the higher ranks. Most hacks aren't detected until people finally report somebody and they go to overwatch.			"

												Best shooting game for me ever. A lot of hackers, but you are able to choose to play in certain time to avoid them. Mostly they are high ranks in competitive mode. Casual, Demolition, Arms Race, Deathmatch mode and workshop maps are fun. Be patient, well teamwork, good in hearing, accurate aim skills and game sense are the keys to be pro in this game. Practice make Perfect !			"

												I used to be an Xbox addict. But after playing this game, I have now stopped playing xbox for months. After all the years of playing COD i have finally figured out why I never had a girl friend. I was alone, played alone, lived alone, I thought it would never end...Then my friends told me about steam and after a while I found this game, Counter Strike: Global Offensive.I was excited to play it, i played it everyday NONSTOP until i felt like going to sleep.One day, I woke up and of course started playing cs go, I noticed what i have became...a csgo addict.I didn't know what to do when i was thinking of that. I quickly shut off my computer and went outside for once. I thought about what i was thinking...I decided to go back inside, still trying to get it out of my head...""a csgo addict"". I started crying...I didn't know what to do. I couldn't stop playing now...I have only just begun. I looked at all the money i had left and wasted it on cs go skins. The addiction is growing. I couldn't stop it even if a tried, thats when i realized...that i have fully became a cs go addict.To this day, I'm still a cs go addict. I love cs go and will never stop playing it...10/10 Ruined my life that i never had...			"

												This is an extremely mixed and short review.I think the game has cool and original gameplay. Though it doesn't highly innovate, it stills maintains the Counter-Strike gameplay that has been going on for about 15 years. Let's talk about the community. About 5% of the people you meet on Global Offensive are really nice people. 95% think they're MLG♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and WILL kick you if you're not very good. I've been kicked multiple times and it feels awful, to think that people don't want you on your team. Makes my stomach drop to the bottomless pit.Seriously, beware of the abysmal community and stick with your friends. If you work together with your friends to prevent the opposing team from winning, you'll have a much better time than you would being John Rambo.But now I'm going to say this is an amazing game and I totally recommend playing it if you like competetive, slow-paced games then play with a group of friends, you'll have fun.

												The new revolver is stupid. CS:GO is a good game due to it having barely any gimmicky guns but it turns around and adds this new pistol with the holding down feature. Also (apart from burst fire) why does it now have a new two fire options gimmick. Also (from my understanding) Valve has been trying to help lower level players get into the game; I came to this conclusion with recent changes to the rankings of players and such. Another issue I have is the nerf that came along: The pistols were not OP in their run and gun status, so why nerf that. If valve wanted to be so anti-run-and-gun then why boost that to the SMGs in a previous update xD. Basically they have added a new overpowered pistol, but on top of that nerfed all other options. The reasons why the R8 is now overpowered is that it's high damage rate. You should not be able to one shot a player that is wearing kevlar but not with a rifle. I understand that it is a ""shotgun pistol"" as such but I believe it throws the balance of the game off. One example of this is that if you hop into any competitive game (aside from the stupid new pause feature which really has no use due to a random game of comp not being in a tournament or league) there is no economy strategy anymore. CS:GO is a tactical shooter, teambased also, but due to the R8 being too OP, teams are now choosing to force buy R8, Kevlar whenever possible. It makes the game less tense and enjoyable when you know every round you can be out gunned out of your hands even if you are 10 rounds up and they have no money. To conclude I believe Valve should remove the R8 from CS and forget it ever existed due to the reasons above. :trainbowbarf::trainbowbarf:Sorry about the rant but this update has been rather disappointing xD			"

												The ever so popular Counter Strike: Global OffensiveWhat do i think of this game? Well, to begin with Counter Strike is a very unique FPS game.  i first played this game in spring 2013 on and off. i finally think i have enough experience to write a review. Unlike other fake games we shall not name (CoD, BF) this game requires some knowledge and skill to play. Pros:Counter Strike does not require a super beefy computer and can be played with a average set up and hardwareCounter Strike has a ""decent"" community and most players are friendly to the other players (i said ""decent"")Counter Strike is not a pay to win game, you are not required to pay money and keep playing, the Operation passes are to support the devs and help keep the game going.Counter Strike has a growing community and you should be able to find competitve matches quickly (depending on the maps you select)Counter Strike has Dust II, Dust II is the best map every created for Competitive level of gameplay.Counter Strike is not FTP, if Counter Strike was FTP the community would crumbleCons:Counter Strike has had problems with Smurfs in the past, the problem has been fixed a little bit, but there are still some smurf problems. Smurfs can ruin a entire game and i know some players who quit playing because of the SmurfsCounter Strike has some hacker and cheater problems, i have played many games where i have run into a cheater. Cheaters ruin the game and it is no fun to play with cheaters.(There are some players who will play without a mic, grief, or throw games, this mostly occurs at lower levels, however i have not run into many of these players)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------These are my thoughts on the game Counter Strike: Global OffensiveI would really suggest giving this game a try if you have not tried it before Thank you for taking your time and reading my review- Boingdom			"

 And now after over 300 hours of playing and while having prime account, i still face lots of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stuff like: 1.Smurfs: if in other team they are boosting someone they've got money from OR if in my team they wanna loose so they can derank to silver l and start smurfing again....so in both sides u will loose the match anyway.2.Cheaters: mostly wallhackers or turn on/off aimbotters.3.Very! unbalanced matches as a result of high smurfs count.4.Alot of rude kids, toxic players (=players that start talking/playing♥♥♥♥♥♥when u fail a 1vs1 or votekick u every round or hit/block u on purpose when they think u play bad) who u should have the confidence of Barrack Obama to be able to deal with.5.Griefers who are usually derank-wanting smurfs. (for definition of griefing search wikipedia)6.If u get kicked many times u will be banned for sometime. really?!?!!About reporting....all reports u do, Will Be Effective but after u loose the match and there will be no points u get back when a cheater is banned. rather than that if u play in a random team containing a cheater even once(which is not your fault) after sometime when he gets banned, u will loose your rank and xp ALOT. and he....he makes a new account and plays again happily :Dthe worst thing is that sadly they just make more money-bringing weapon skins rather than fixing the games problems. (lol now u can buy physical ""5 year veteran"" coin if u have the virtual one...wow...physical money-making strategy for 2017)Anyway, im still addicted to this♥♥♥♥♥♥and i cant really stop playing it. dont really know why.....============================================================= ***PAST REVIEW - POSITIVE - (when my playtime was around 200 hours)*** lol i dont really know what to say about my past review (u can read it in the bottom) but as i got more far from cs1.6 and when went to play other games, a strong passion to multiplayer fps made me come back to this game.anyway...its a great fps game to me, not a pure cs ofc but most similar game to it in the market.rather than explaining the quality of fps thing about this game in detail, i wanna talk about the multiplayer side.its AWESOME! why? its clear. it has a No-Mercy Cooldown (Ban) System that bans ppl who leave a match, kick others so many times, get kicked so many times, attack a teammate twice in beginning of each round, kill 3 teammates in 30 rounds, and man u know whats great about this cooldown system? imagine u get a 30min cooldown. from when that ban ends till 7 days if u get another cooldown for whatever reason it would be 24 hours. and again if u get a cooldown sooner than 7 days after ban ends, that would be 7 days! and so on....also, The Repoting System Works Pretty Fine. after starting to seriously play for a month (my previous played time was 20 hours without any competitive matches played) ive been thanked 4 times for reporting cheaters. valve has some Inspectors[blog.counter-strike.net] who watch a random demo of the players thats been reported so many times in longterm or alot less but in short time, and if that proves their guilt that means a good enough ban depending on what theyve done. so, if someone Griefs[en.wikipedia.org], if abuses other ppl using mic or text (or also if someone is a ""kid""), just block him when in match and report him and ask others to report him too. dont report him just once...do it many times.well....im an honest person....so to be honest...the problem is that....any cheater/abuser/griefer (including smurf) who gets banned from playing in official servers can make another steam account again.but when they make a new account they have to rank it up to 3 and then they can't win more than 2 matches in a day until they win 10 matches of competitive. so their comeback will be delayed.but theres a better way to avoid cheaters/smurfs:  the solution to that problem is simple. play competitive matches from wednesday when weekly xp boost is available and play until u reach ""reduced earned xp"" each week and u will get to lvl 21 soon. then, get a prime account. it effectively reduces cheaters and smurfs in matches u play.all being said, this game is ALIVE cuz theres no csgo 2 or csgo 3 which we see about other multiplayer games. so valve still supports the game rather than making a new version of it. plus that u wont loose a thing if u spend time boosting your skills in this game as its not gonna die.definately 10/10.============================================================= ***PAST REVIEW - NEGATIVE - (when my playtime was around 10 hours)*** As u see have not played go much as i have no passion for playing more than this :Dfirst of all this game is not a ""counterstrike"". its a ""regular"" shooting game thats ideal for ppl who have never played cs1.6.for new generation maybe. ppl who want a new good-looking game, rather than a traditional looking but more ""alive"" game. ive found csgo dead, blury, joy-less, and soul-less if that makes sense. unlike that colorful and exciting one 1.6 is.simply....didnt like it.(no ""counterstrike"" vibe it has to me)if u want an online fps game play cod or a more realistic and complicated one arma3 but if u want sth between cod and cs which is worse than both u can play csgo. ;Dfor ppl who want that ""counterstrike"" vibe but just want a newer version of cs1.6 and also dont care about PGL, play source.condition zero also would be a very good choice to me if u dont care about its age.

												It's important to appreciate games like this for what they are, and this game is a callback to a past chapter of video game history that's been buffed and polished. And unfortunately as someone who never actually played the original Counter-Strike games, I'm not in much of a position to judge exactly how well they pulled this off.Basically, it entirely boils down to the kind of person you are. If you're a die-hard Counter-Strike fan, then this is probably all you can ask for. If you're a more typical gamer who just finished playing Crysis or Battlefield and wants to pick up something to play over the weekend, then trust me when I say that this is NOT the game for you.It's the online FPS equivilent of Dark Souls, in a way.

												Fact:Have played CS series since the first, cannot recommend this game. Very broken - you can do anywhere from 11 to 200 damage when shooting someone with a shotgun no matter how well you aim and how close you are, you will see blood pour out of your enemies to have the game tell you you did no damage, and you will shoot someone in the head with an assault rifle and do 2 damage when they do 211 with the same rifle (despite them having no armour or helmet and you do).Opinion:The recoil pattern feature in this game is also silly, as you literally have to aim downwards and draw a T shape while shooting to keep your shots on target (Yes, the patterns are essentially fixed patterns)  with the crosshair rather than do your best to keep it focussed on them. Guns which are the same  calibre and similar barrel lengths (sometimes have longer barrels by far) will do alot less damage and penetrate armour worse than more expensive ones. Doesn't make any sense.This game is very broken and I suggest you just play CSS instead, as it is alot more accurate and features 100 tick servers (over competitive 64 tick, COMPETITIVE). CSS is also more expensive by 5 bucks because maybe valve knows that csgo is a complete mess.TL;DR: CSGO isn't a CS about skill, it is a CS about  rolling the dice everytime you shoot someone.If you don't believe me then youtube a video of CSGO hit detection, I assure you you'll be amazed at how bad it is.EDIT: Turns out the game was originally going to be made for consoles but then Valve decided to develop it more for PC instead - Game is a console port too.

												I'll go in depth as to why my reasoning is what it is: The ""matchmaking"" is non-existant, I've played a fair few games of competitive, yet rarely do they seem balanced or fair, as a player with little under 100 hours, I get pitched against players with 300/400 hours, how can Valve call this sorry excuse of a matchmaking system good? I find it appauling that they could even consider saying this game even contains matchmaking. Another large problem is hackers, they seem to slip past Valve with little to no problems, either Valve don't care, or have given up trying to prevent them. Overall, a 5/10, as the game itself isn't the problem, it's Valve's end that's letting it down largely.			"

												This game is one of the best competitive games out their but its over the most over rate game of all time. People say its better than COD but that can only be a statement for people who play both games competitivly. If your looking for fun casual/comp game then COD is their but if your looking for a very very competitvly game with minor fun this game is for you. Also the amount of support this game gets is♥♥♥♥♥♥compared to how much money they take out of people who open cases.

												UPDATE: The cheating problem is resolved. The game would actually make funIF IT ONLY WORKED ON GNU/Linux and macOSIt is unplayable on a mac. The FPS are just fine, the problem is the game doesn't start 50% of the time. Also, CS:GO is the only macOS game I know that fails to fullscreen right.I have very frequent crashes on GNU/Linux and The worst thing, that really made me uninstall CS is this:I was kicked out of a match because my PC bluescreen'd. I restarted it within 1 minute. But when I tried to ""reconnect"" I got the error ""Match could not be joined / Matchmaking failed""After 5 minutes of failed reconnecting, I was banned for 30 minutes. Internet and Steam Logon were working perfectly fine. This was my first ban in 350 hours total play time. The ban wasn't my fault, and writing Steam support would take longer than just waiting 30 minutes.There are plenty of better games, most notably Terraria from Re-Logic. Half the price, double the fun. Still gets updates after 5 years without DLCs and skins.Terraria shows what the gaming industry could be,CS:GO shows what it really is~ FIRST REVIEW ~ The single-player aspect of the game is useless, the bots are so bad for this small amont of maps.I stopped playing because of too many cheaters.You can't play the multiplayer because every tenth game or some you come across a cheater.VAC is so bad, it doesn't even detect a hacker that is killing all other players in a split second.Not only is the anticheat bad, but the devs release mandatory gamechanging updates all the time. They completely change maps or gameplay without asking the community first. It's a whole other game than the first release.With every update there are 200+ exploits more.Singleplayer and multiplayer are flawed, go play some good game like Terraria and then come back to CS:GO and be shocked how bad it is.

												I'll go in depth as to why my reasoning is what it is: The ""matchmaking"" is non-existant, I've played a fair few games of competitive, yet rarely do they seem balanced or fair, as a player with little under 100 hours, I get pitched against players with 300/400 hours, how can Valve call this sorry excuse of a matchmaking system good? I find it appauling that they could even consider saying this game even contains matchmaking. Another large problem is hackers, they seem to slip past Valve with little to no problems, either Valve don't care, or have given up trying to prevent them. Overall, a 5/10, as the game itself isn't the problem, it's Valve's end that's letting it down largely.			"

												This game is one of the best competitive games out their but its over the most over rate game of all time. People say its better than COD but that can only be a statement for people who play both games competitivly. If your looking for fun casual/comp game then COD is their but if your looking for a very very competitvly game with minor fun this game is for you. Also the amount of support this game gets is♥♥♥♥♥♥compared to how much money they take out of people who open cases. They never make a new map only remake ones to make it better which will take more than 10 months to ♥♥♥♥ing make and then once the new map is released it will still be unplayable. Im giving this game a negitive review as i believe its the most over rated game ever developed and comparing it to other fps's is stupid as they different.			"

												Global Offensive is the latest franchise in Counter Strike. Awesome new layout in the main menu and the same goes for the buy screen when the start of a match. After each match, the weapons that you are currently using will be load up on ammo automatically. There are several new weapons in this franchise, so...you can look forward on using all the weapons. Another thing that is new in this game will be the weapon camos, I am not 100% sure on how to get this....but from what I've heard from my friends...you can keep on playing the game until you unlock new camos in-game or you can make your own unique camos in the Counter Strike Global Offensive Workshop. There are 5 modes in this game: Demolition, Arms Race, Competitive, Casual and Deathmatch. New maps are added in the game or...you can choose to download extra new maps from the Counter Strike Global Offensive Workshop for more fun!! I recommend on buying this game when it goes on sale!

												Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is arguably the best game on the market. Ever.CS:GO (Counter-Strike: Global Offensive henceforth) sets new standards for FPS gaming. Guns 'n Glory (mostly Guns)CS:GO, like COD: Whatevercrap, features many guns. CS:GO features two different teams, Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, with distinct armories. Ranging from the classic Desert Eagle, which pwns faces, to the CZ25, a freakin' auto pistol, to the SCAR-20, an AUTOMATIC SNIPER RIFLE, to the infamous AK-47, CS:GO's wide range of weapons allows for adaptable play-style (or in other words, AWP ALL THE ROUNDS). Players can even customize their own guns, naming them, stickering them and painting them with in-game skins. CS:GO also features other non-gun weaponry. Grenades are prominent in rounds, from the classic High Explosive Grenade to Flashbangs to Moltovs. Players also can utilise Kevlar Armor and Helmets, which are useful against most guns. Finally, you can tase people. Fun.Gameplay/GamemodesUnlike CS:S and 1.6, CS:GO kicks butt with new gamemodes. Different playstyles are designed with time and experience in mind- now, those without much time can play quicker games such as Arms Race, where players compete to get a kill with every weapon. It moves on to Demolition, a ""simplified"" version of Classic with only one bombsite, and no freedom in what weapons the player uses. Then, we get to the big leagues, with Casual, a drop-in game style much like Competitve, but more relaxed without early-dropout penalties and free armour.Then, there's competitive. This is where it really gets fun. 5v5 teams, the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists, fight to the death to plant a bomb or save hostages. Competitive really brings out teamwork and strategy. Players have to buy guns and armour strategically, and winning counts. Competitve is really the crowning jewel of CS:GO. It even evens out the ""unfairness"" of maps, allowing both teams to play 15 rounds per side.Graphics/PerformanceCS:GO is not at all taxing on computers. I myself own a 2GB RAM computer, and it runs perfectly fine on lower Graphics settings. Other computers, such as that monster 16GB Alienware, can run on high setttings, beautifully visualising the different maps made by Valve and the Community. Hats?While CS:GO does not have hats (damn), it does feature weapon skins and stickers. Deck your own guns out with sick skins, whether it be as colourful as ""Death By Kitty"" for the P90, or as bloody serious as Crimson Web for the SCAR-20. Players can get skins by playing on VAC-secured serverts (nobody likes cheaters), unboxing Weapon Crates with Keys (think TF2), trading with other players, or buying them from the community market. Some guns are *special* (like me!), with StatTrak guns letting players count the kills acheived by the gun, or Souvenir-versions based on pro-tournaments. CS:GO also recently added stickers. Players can put stickers on their guns to show support for their favourite pro-teams, support for Eco-Rounds or dancing bannanas. CommunityCS:GO has an amazing community. The Steam Workshop has new skins and maps for players to try out, and in Operations, Valve adds these wondorus creations to CS:GO. In addition, there is a very supportive community online. Anybody who isn't gets an AWP to the face. Big deterrent.Overall, CS:GO is a great game. BUY IT FREAKIN' NOW!			"

												Brought to you by the same people who took a huge♥♥♥♥♥♥all over the legacy and name of the Team Fortress Franchise for money comes the next hot new low effort money making scheme and another example of why Valve does not need to make good games anymore. Prepare yourself, for a poorly balanced bug filled experience full of hackers and microtransactions. Get ready to play with Russians with terrible mics who cant speak english but who the game matches you up with anyway and 12 year olds with literal down syndrome while the game constantly shoves crates on to you to try and coerce you into gambling for silly skins and dumb stickers that cost like 3.00 bucks a pop. Whats that? Why are there no sprays? You silly! Valve saw that and decided it was just too fun and not making them enough money, now you get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pre-made sprays that you get to pay for AND are limited use! Isnt that great? I cant believe its not free2play!All in all CS:GO is a giant money making scheme where literally anything you do makes Valve money so that means they dont even have to work on the game themselves since the skin makers and mappers do everything for them, so all valve needs to do is leech off of the community itself! Why make bug fixes or new content when you can just add a bunch of dumb neon ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t skins to the game that you didnt even make that rich furries will pay for!?The most fun you will get out of this game is commiting holy griefing jihad against the scum of the ♥♥♥♥ing earth that plays this game competitively.

												Counter Strike - a huge franchise from Valve, I mean who hasn't heard of the countless streams, case openings and wizardrys all around this game, right? As someone who has played previous Counter Strikes, I get mixed feelings when thinking about Global Offensive.No, not the russians cussing in their casual environment on dust2 cause this, but rather all the hype about the rather questionable content of the actual game. For me, I always tend to find myself having difficulties in games that offer people to spend real-life money for a game, especially if it's for skins that do only aesthetically change your game, but let's talk about that anyways.For those which do not know about it (likely not many people), CSGO offers people to gain Skins for your weapons, by either getting them dropped while playing, or opening cases (that cost) that contain many different skins, with a randomized chance of getting something good or bad.

												Matchmaking in this game is literally the most terrible thing i've ever stepped into. Just trying to rank up is literally impossible seeing the people that actually play this game either greif, hack, or flame. And it's pretty common to start a game with a useless bot because people don't know how to manage their time. It's about 1/5 chances you will be put in a good PUG and not only that, the game is infested with hackers. Every holiday the game goes on sale for basically pocket change and hackers just ruin the game. Good luck getting in a game with people who actually have common sense. "

												Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing----------------------------------------Overall Game----------------------------------------CS:GO has a lot of gameplay options for players - community servers offering a variety of game modes, casual gaming ranging from defuse maps, hostage maps, deathmatch mode, and a fast-paced Arms Race mode where you aim to go through each weapon until you get a Golden Knife kill to win.  Beyond casual gaming, there is a competitive system that rank-matches you, similar to many other FPS games, and runs for up to 30 rounds of CS, after which your rank is affected one way or another.Competitive play is both extremely challenging and extremely rewarding, although some players either take it far too seriously or treat it like casual unranked gaming.  It's hard to find a team that sits in the nice middle ground between the two.If you've played a shooter game before, GO will be familiar.  WASD, crouching, walking (as opposed to running), and grenades.  It's relatively straightforward gameplay, only made hard by the skill of your opponents.The game has a bit of a learning curve.  Each weapon acts differently and may take some time to learn which you like and which works best in certain situations.  After that, the grenades are the next thing to consider attempting to master.  They often can turn a losing game into a winning one.The best way to learn is to play, so get in there and have fun. :DOverall Rating: 9/10----------------------------------------Overall Accessibility----------------------------------------CS:GO is not very accessible for deaf gamers.The game itself has no captions that I have been able to find, but the only thing that would need captioning is the weapons tutorial that you're likely to use once, if at all.CS can consistently be a challenge to deaf gamers because of the significant impact of sound during play.  Many players OFTEN sit and wait for the enemy to come near, reacting to footsteps or grenades/weapon fire that cannot be seen, but can be easily heard.  One particular edge hearing gamers have over deaf gamers is guard the target area from a distance by listening for nearby enemies, only moving out of hiding when they need to.  A deaf gamer's need to see the target site to properly defend it puts them at greater risk of being killed.Additionally, competitive mode gamers make heavy use of the microphone capability to communicate quickly.  There are text/voice binds in game (using the Z, X, and C keys) that can convey significant messages rather quickly and easily, but I find that most hearing gamers at mid-level skill are not receptive to either the voice binds or to text chat.Deaf gamers in competitive gaming may encounter hostility or discrimination from hearing gamers.Rating: 3/10Subtitles/Text----------------------------------------None, though none are really needed.Chatting/Communicating----------------------------------------Chatting is available for team and global chat during matches and while observing.  Although, as I mentioned, some people are not responsive to chat, it is still offered.			"

												Counter Strike - a huge franchise from Valve, I mean who hasn't heard of the countless streams, case openings and wizardrys all around this game, right? As someone who has played previous Counter Strikes, I get mixed feelings when thinking about Global Offensive.No, not the russians cussing in their casual environment on dust2 cause this, but rather all the hype about the rather questionable content of the actual game. For me, I always tend to find myself having difficulties in games that offer people to spend real-life money for a game, especially if it's for skins that do only aesthetically change your game, but let's talk about that anyways.For those which do not know about it (likely not many people), CSGO offers people to gain Skins for your weapons, by either getting them dropped while playing, or opening cases (that cost) that contain many different skins, with a randomized chance of getting something good or bad. Considering this game has made it to ESL-Niveau, where even Teams, Tournaments, Global Matches and Prizes exist, having a pay-to-win aspect in it, is quite necessary nowadays. I do not mean to critisize anyone liking this, as I myself have had an inventory worth more than 10'000$ (by gambling), I definetely do understand the kick for all of this, but after all, as an old school gamer I'm asking you; Is this what gaming has envolved into?

												Probably the best shooter i've ever played in my entire life.The only thing that bothers me are the hackers (FACEIT/MM)Valve do something about your garbage VAC system. Hackers are everywhere.To the hackers: You guys suck major♥♥♥♥♥♥for not being able to achieve a rankup without hacking. Boosting isn't even doing worth it. Listen up people if you are getting boosted by a hacker, when he gets a VAC ban your ranks will go down from itself. Boosting is not worth spending money to pay someone to bring you in a rank you can't handle.Thank you for reading this i hope you have a nice day, keep the community clean! ;)			"

												Counter Strike can be very addicting to people like me who play a lot. Considering there is a lot of raging and players getting tilted, you will get players who will throw the game. Other examples include people who don't care about the game and start hacking on legit players, smurfs which are people that are higher rank but then they buy or make another account that's a lower rank to play with noobs or lower ranked people, and finally the derankers aka known as the people who enter a game and don't try to play or help the team in any way. This can include telling the enemy team your team's positions, team killing, and other♥♥♥♥♥♥like that. 2nd problem is that the matchmaking system is so♥♥♥♥♥♥that it physically puts you against super good people with a terrible team. This can be stupid because for example, if you're trying to rank up and you need one more game, it will be physcially impossible to rank up in any matter. Hitreg is♥♥♥♥♥♥and can ♥♥♥♥ itself. I hit a noscope right on the head and it counted as a ♥♥♥♥ing leg. Furthermore, the mechanics are poor and are ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥ You will play against a lot of smurfs and trolls no matter what ♥♥♥♥ing rank you are which is very poorly designed. I am very addicted to this game and I want to stop, but I can't simply because of trying to win and rank up to Global or LE. If you don't make any friends on csgo, and you are playing matchmaking expect to ♥♥♥♥ing win 10% of the time. The cheating system is quite slow and stupid. You have to have a amount of people report a guy and then it goes through a month of waiting to overwatch and then the judge finally decides if that person gets banned or not. but SIMPLY, my issue is that I keep playing with the worst teammates who can not call out, have no teamwork, can't ♥♥♥♥ing trade kills, and cannot call out any plan for the team to go. FINALLY, this game is addiciting but as ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥it is, I wouldn't want to play comp or anything again. ♥♥♥♥ SMURFS AND HACKERS			"

This is coming from someone that's played Counter-Strike since it's early betas of it being a Half-Life mod. While it is infested with those previously mentioned, when you get a clean game, there's no other game that can hold a candle to CS when it comes to competitive play.Everyone should at least try this game once.

												A great game.It's not only competitive, it has side games in community servers like Trouble In Terrorist Town, Bunny Hopping, Surfing, etc. This game can give you a great advancement in your mental state. You need patience to be an AWPer, You need extra time to train for weapon sprays, reaction time, aim, and just plain pratice to get better.Casual:10 on 10 Bomb Mission, great for getting to know the maps because if you are new and bad/and or do not kow what your doing nobody will care. Very Fun, and can meet some interesting ""Characters"".Demolition:One of the mini type of gamemode in Counter Strike: GO.This is a 5 on 5 Bomb Mission with only 1 bomb site. Once you get a kill the next round you upgrade to a better or worst weapon. I use this for pratice or if a friend needs help.Arms Race (Gun Game):This is a pretty old game mode with a new name. Your on a Team Death Match, but every 2 kills you upgrade your weapon.Deathmatch:The best way to pratice, all guns are free you get infinite ammo (sv_infiniteammo 2(Reloads after 1 Magazine)) YOU WILL NEED TO PRATICE ON HERE (NOT WITH BOTS)Competitive:The most played and most stressed game mode in CSGO. ITs a 5 v 5 with skill groups S1 to GEAs your skill gets better you get a better rank, and harder enemies. Do not solo que because, you will get ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ teammates who dont know what the ♥♥♥♥ they are doing, best to find friends that you can agree on strats, and buy.Overall a great game.Nominated for ""Just 5 more mins"" in honor of 2k hours			"

												This is a short review for people that are new to this game. I have some tips that many people won't tell you:1. Learn to use the UMP-45. If you watch close angles with it, terrorists wont be able to cross and enter A or B site(Also it is very cheap, so you can almost buy it every round. People will call you a hacker)2. If you're a Silver and cant rank up, just play with your Gold Nova friends, because there are smurfs in silver ranks.. aswell as trolls.3. Your team must be like a wall that covers every way to the sites (CT)4. You must cover every way, so that ct's can not push on you, or behind you.. (T)5. You must trade kills (Right after your teammate dies, you must retake his position and kill the enemy)6. Be ready to shoot again after you kill an enemy7. Dont forget to check that corner (If everything is way too quiet and the enemy team has 5 players)8. Don't trust your teammates (We all make mistakes. Sometimes they'll better see you die with the c4, so they can plant and get the MVP)9. If you're shy, no need to use your mic like everyone says you should. Some people use it way too much, especially when its 14:15 against you.10. Dont buy flashes if you're holding a position. They are meant for terrorists.11. Dont spray more than 4 bullets, remember to reset your inaccuracy.12. Set your volume high if you don't have headphones and turn your default music kit off (will improve hearing)13. Use a crosshair that you can clearly spot on (I use red crosshair +)14. Follow your teammates commands and strategy (if they have one), and you wont get kicked.14. If you're bottom fragging and you do the above mentioned, your team sucks.15. Uninstall if nothing works, wait 2 months, then install again.			"

												Perform poorly in one game and get trashed talked. Perform highly in the next game and nobody says anything.Most stressful game ever, but hell, it's worth it. The feeling of power when you are carrying your team to victory is like no other! Not to mention the fact you can get skins for your weapons! Beyond reasonible doubt you do not need to spend anything on this game apart from the money spent buying it in the first place. For those not interest in competetive play, CSGO has many community servers available such as Surf and JailBreak.All in all its a fun game to mess around with mates or prove your worth in commetitive.

												Very addicting game.  The strongest point this game has is its history.  The game has been around for over a decade.  It has a very steep learning curve, and a high skill ceiling to match.  The most vibrant competitive scene of any FPS on the market.  You can see my full review of the game here.

												So a bit over 2 and a half years have passed since I reviewed the game for the first time.Back then I had maybe about 2-300 hours, I have now passed 2200 hours and I still love the game despite of all the changes both to mechanics in the game and the community in general.Back then there were barely any Russians that played the game, at least what I could notice.Now it's infested with Russians.Tho I can still have fun despite them not speaking remotely close to English or listening to me.I've been up and down the ranks numerous times meeting people that are anywhere from Silver 1 to Global elite.Still fun :DEdit: Just adding this due to the 2016 Autumn sale.Old part of the review from January 2014:I have recently started playing this more and more (WHY DID I NOT START EARLIER). The game is a blast playing with friends and even randoms that do comunicate. Getting awarded with items at random after a matchmaking game is a good way to keep you playing.			"

												Since an old fan of Halo games i find, CS:GO a nice sequel to the franchise. You can jump with p90, AWP or AK and make headshots, like a true spartan.I like it, since with p90 is so ez that i'm eagle right now and i'm going supreme easly, only thanks to this weapon.Then the real DLC that this game deserve: The russians. Halo had no russian, and this game is full of it. Since the game is so easy that is more hard to play in silver levels than in eagle levels, the Russians make the game quite challenging. Like when you got one in your team, you know that the game will be a thug battle.(Just kidding Love y'all! <3)Thanks Valve for the best Hal.. ehm CS you have ever made.			"

												As of right now (8/12/2016) I assume it must be difficult for new players to get into the game.The prime matchmaking thing has just made it even worse for players just starting out and non-prime must be filled with smurfs and/or hackers.If you can grind out to level 21 and unlock prime matchmaking, this game is still great.The competitive feeling and actual gameplay has no match. Counter-Strike in my opinion is the best PC FPS currently available and while the community may be toxic at times, it's overall one of my top 5 games I've ever played.			"

I got asked to do the English version out of it.The thing is, it is waaaay too long. So when I started doing it, at the half of it, I ran out of place. Couldn't type anymore.So I deleted the French version as far as English is the most used langage in the world :)Be aware that I am only 18 and I self-taught English to myself, so it might be bad. FPS Amateur, welcome to CS:GO!One of the best and most popular current FPS in the World! (Please, don't get me wrong and don't say that I said it's the < Best Game ever > :P)As far as I know, I am not a big fan of FPS games, which show how much this one is a good one :DBut don't get me wrong. I won't say only good stuffs about this game ! ^^I wanna insist on the fact that the game is only $14,99 and can lower to 7~8 in Steam Sold! :)The good stuffs about CS:GO:- As far as we know, CS:GO, in contrary to most of FPS games, is not a Pay²Win.The only few stuffs you can get are skin stuffs. (Weapon cases, skins, keys...) which is only useful for cosmetic!(I beg you to not judge people that pays skins.It's like judging people that buy games massively, have knives collection in real life, car collection... or even just even buying games at really high price that are not worth it! ^^)Which can be nice to have too! :D- The game is based on real skills.Bye, bye, games with broken weapons only with Zomms on it! (Even pistols :P) There might be two or three weapons that way, but not every weapons has one!The whole game would only depend on your skills that you'd grow by time!Your reflexes, your precision, hearing where the enemy steps are perfectly, the weapon shots are master words!- Many maps available.The rank system 5v5 allows you to chose any map you wish to play one what is available.Most of them are balanced, some a re not either. But there is always a way to be good at both sides with a few trainings!- The Workshop allow the community to make many maps to train your skills and become one of the best player of CS:GO!Headshots, perfect spray, and every kind of training that would make you a better player!- New cases shows up regularly in game.Players can drop them in game (normal or ranked one!).What's the good point about that?If you drop the in the first hours they show up, you can sell it until $30! (Yes, I saw that! :P)And then, when it spread itself more, the cost would quickly lower to around $8.And one week later, the price would be around $1.So, try your luck on the first days!- Last part of the good points:Rankeds are really nicely optimized.One game 5v5, you can kick negative players.If they are an AFK, he'd be auto-kick after 2 or 3 games.If you don't want to wait, you can kick him.Otherwise, he may comeback in the 5 next mins. ^^If he doesn't, oh well he gets a ban.The Team-Kill system is kinda stupid.You can kill your teammates, (which can add difficulties. Which is understandable.)But, of course, it becomes a ban reason. If you kill 3 teammates (or if you do too much teammate damage in a short amount of time) you'd get banned.The bans system work that way:1rst ban: 30 minutes.2nd ban: 2 hours.3rd ban: 1 day.4th ban: 7 days.Do not worry, there is no permanent ban!The next ban could be just a little 30 mins even if you had one before! It reset itself after a little amount of time being clean. :)(Those bans work the same for when you leave a game ^^!)  Negative facts: - I'm gonna make it simple..Of course, one of the major problem of the game is, the smurfs and the hackers.Most of time, they are smurfs (coming from the Rank Supreme or Global which are the highest) that have fun to play against Silvers on another account.I don't find this funny because that happen almost everytime. ^^But, don't give up!Just because they are smurfs in enemy team doesn't mean you can't win.Every players have a weakness. You just need to find it.- Les hackers.Bien qu'il y a un système de VAC, souvent des hackers ne se feront pas arrêter.Heureusement, cela ne se passe pas dans chaque game donc en général vous pouvez jouer paisiblement.Et s'il y a un hacker, y'a des chances qu'il se fasse ban pendant la même game.- Hackers.Obviously, they are a VAC system. Most of time hackers doesn't get arrested by it.Gladly, you don't get to see hackers every game anyway. So, in general, you can play peacefully.And if they are an hacker, they are some chances that they gets banned while you're playing the game against them.- Some players ruining the community.Most of players would say that it's Russians or Polish players's fault.But they are not only them.Lots of french, lots of germans, lots of portuguese..It comes from everywhere!There is no perfect community.They are only mentaly disturbed people. oAoThanks god, there is a ""Mute"" button! :)Anyway! I am gonna stop here. There is lots of stuffs to say about this game but it's already a very long review! :)Good luck, have fun to the few people remaining that are going to buy the game :) "

												Another game in the Counter-Strike Trilogy. At first i didnt like it, but now after all the updates and since it got more famous in the editing community then i gave it another shot, and i have to say its a very good game! The recoil might be a bit weird, but youll get more used to it over time. CS:S is the best game ive ever played, so its weird getting used to, but you can master it.A lot of nice ideas with this game, and the community isnt too bad.The skins.. Eeerrhhh.. I dont know, but its a genius idea from VALVe and also a goldmine for them.I do enjoy collecting the skins and stuff, but its not like i want to pay 120€ for a knife skin, thats just ridiculous. But the game is very good and polished, and definitely worth a try if youre a CS fan.The competitive side in this game is really good, and probably the best side of the game. Its just too amazing at being competitive. One of the most perfect games to play serious in.A little thing to the bad sides though, when people shoot, and till they actually hit someone seems to be.. weird. Theres a slight delay from shooting till it hits and that is what i find most difficult in this game really, the recoil you can learn to master, but this is just not good.Editing in this game is ruined compared to CS:S, you cant remove all hud, or well, you can but it can be tricky and it shouldnt be. Also the deathnotice pops up later than in any CS which can ruin hard cutted edits too. And as i mentioned before the delay on the shots also ruin the editing a bit, so yeah.I dont know what more there is to say other than that i enjoy this game and its competitive side a lot too. I highly recommend this game if you like CS and just FPS games in general.I would rate it 9/10 JUST because of the delay on the shots, if that werent there, i would give it 10, so please VALVe, fix this if you can and it will be one of the best FPS's ever!Anyways, thanks for reading and i hope i helped you to make up your mind to buy it or not.

												Prime matchmaking is a failure.Hackers are still in the game.Matchmake abuse is still in the game.Tapping is still non-existence.This game is broken. Out of 10 games, 6 of them, you meet someone hacking. Especially if you are in the last few ranks, MGE, DMG, LE, LEM, SMFC, GE.Those losers will hack and boost ranks. CSGO's failure to detect hack is a joke, after 15 years of developing the game.You would expect a perfect system of detection. The game is balanced, you can 1 v 5 but it is ruined by hackers.			"

												Boy oh boy is this ****** cancer!Very unfriendly to new players. Low ranks are a bottomless pit with no escape unless you get a whole new account due to smurfs, trolls, hackers and people who are idiots. Loss after loss forever, versus 5 cued smurfs on the other team or hackers.So you would think, after spending CASH on this game, that I would be able to play with my friends, right? I bought the game for that.Nope! You have to play 5 hours of casual. During which, people micspam racist music and other things, act toxic, insult, etc.After that- Things will get better, right? Nope! Low rank matches have hackers upon hackers, smurfs upon smurfs, and you get loss after loss as you're trying to learn the game. Why would Valve increase the price of their game or IP ban hackers? The hackers buy the game for $15 again and again, to troll 2 to 4 matches, then get banned, and repeat. And repeat. So why would they stop if it makes them money?I would much prefer to spend $60 on a game I know works than $15 on a game that is nothing but aids and racial slurs.Once you win 10 comp. matches, things get better, right?Nopity Nope! You get banned for a full 24 hours FOR WINNING. You have to sit there AND WAIT and can't play comp again!Add a new paypal account? Great- you can't trade items for 6 days!Just got the game? Great! You can't sell or buy items for a full month!Everything about this game treats new players like they're cheaters/hackers/smurfs/trolls, while allowing experienced players to do those things with little effort. Very steep learning curve that is not helped in most ways, very toxic community, very fustrating game mechanics, server performance getting worse every day- rubber banding at 65 ping, if you have more than 250ms ping you teleport all over the map and can do nothing at all, and on top of it all- you get banned just for WINNING. As well as abandoning.Would not recommend stay away, you have been warned.			"

												So Counter Strike Global Offensive (CSGO) is the latest revision of the long running Half-Life mod fps. Created by Hidden Path the game is more of a refinement towards modern day military shooters then previous instalments such cs 1.6, cscz  and css. This is mainly to allow a more broaden appeal to the masses of COD and Battlefield generation.You see CS generally has always had a very hardcore user base that is highly skilled. You'd be lucky to find yourself top of your first few games as a beginner like you could do in the fore-mentioned rival franchises in competitive multiplayer. How have they achieved this and to what extent it is successful is down to personal preference. The newly included arms race and demolition modes allows for a more fast pace and tightly confined CQC mode that allows the players little to no down time unlike the traditional bomb/defuse or hostage maps that most players are familiar with. For me though these modes are not the real meat of the game and if you’re an experienced player these will only be glanced over and served as a side show at before delving into the traditional modes.The inclusion of some new weapons and equipment helps to change up csgo such as the Molotov and allow for different variations of old school tactics. Most of the well know maps are available from the offset and the workshop community is as good as it gets with newly created maps, game types and weapon skins to name but a few. There is the introduction of operation payback  whereby a selection of community maps are promoted and available for players for a small fee across the whole of csgo and some of these are a delight to play.So why would you choose this over css for the experienced player. I find that it adheres to the original 1.6 far more closely then css ever did. The aiming is tight and follows the recoil sprays on many of the automatic guys far more closely. There are many updates that valve and hidden path are pushing though, such as spectator mode, competition spectators i.e. Dreamhack, newly released weapon finishes through drops and crate drops and newly revised maps being released mirage and cobble to name but a few. For me the main reason for this instalment above all others if the great competitive mode. Ranked csgo was never really available unless you sign up to a league such as ED, played pcw’s or cups. Now however with competitive mode 5vs5 ranked games are a blast if not for a few small problems that really need to be ironed out. These include dropped players being replaced by bots, hacking and over watch submissions, uneven rank matches to name but a few. If you though take the game as it meant to be played as a highly skilled social and fun game then the latest version of this simple but vastly complex game will delight you as it has me.			"

CS:GO is the game of the 21th century!I like it that much that I started hosting community servers at the beginning of 2016. After a short time I named the -=WarmupServer=-s, because you can train your aim and warmup for the Competetive Matchmaking-, Faceit-, ESEA-Games. There you play 5vs5 with four teammates. This part of the game combines tactics and dexterity.However if you start with that game, it will take some time to get into it! But keep it up! You will hate it, you will love it, but in the end you will say it is the best game for real E-Sports! The 18 different ranks of matchmaking helps haveing fun even if you are a beginner.If you get deeper into the game have a look at my servers:USA:216.245.214.186:27021 24slot FFA-DM-MultiCFG - Dust2EUROPE:85.14.232.128:27015 24slot FFA-DM-MultiCFG - Dust285.14.236.97:27015 17slot FFA-DM-MultiCFG - Dust285.14.237.142:27015 18slot FFA-DM-MultiCFG - Cache89.163.161.148:27035 24slot FFA-DM-MultiCFG - Inferno85.14.229.112:27015 25slot FFA-DM-MultiCFG - Zeusmix (special cfgs)89.163.161.150:27035 20slot FFA-DM-MultiCFG - Dust2 (incl. m4-cfg)89.163.161.147:27015 20slot FFA-DM-MultiCFG - HS only (incl. m4-cfg)89.163.161.148:27015 24slot FFA-DM-RIFLE - Dust285.14.237.183:27015 20slot FFA-DM-RIFLE - Dust2 (no helmet)85.14.236.187:27015 14slot DM-MultiCFG - aim_map_classic only85.14.235.251:27015 14slot RETAKES - Mapvote89.163.161.146:27055 10slot RETAKES - Mapvote85.14.230.92:27015 8slot RETAKES - Mapvote89.163.161.146:27015 12slot RETAKES - Dust289.163.161.149:27035 24slot 1VS1 ARENA - MapvoteIf you get into the game, you will start editing your config and working with the console. Here is a nice shortcut for your personal userconfig:alias dust2 ""connect 85.14.232.128:27015""If you have installed that, you just need to enter dust2 into your console and you will connect to the 24slot MultiCFG DUST2 server. However, if the server is full, you need a reserved slot (VIP), to join a server like this. Of course this is working with all my servers!There are a lot of other things you can do with your config.

												I played CS from 1.5 - started out when I was 12 or 13 I believe. Played 1.6 for years, went to live events and was by far my favorite game to play and watch. I remember the WCG in 2006 with Sweden vs Poland and how much I just loved the game. Eventually like everything, scene slowly died and between one thing and another stopped playing. In November of 2014 I wanted to give a shot at my favorite old FPS - which now was ""CS:GO"". Downloaded, tried it. At first I wasn't fully convinced due to the fact that I haven't played CS in ages and I was still used to 1.6, however - with some more time I started to like it. Watched Dreamhack final 2014, LDLC vs NiP and was glad to see familiar faces I knew from 1.6 like f0rest and get_right. I got hooked up once again and now it's for sure my favorite game yet again.There are some major things that need to be fixed like hitboxes, planting hitboxes, jumping hitboxes and ladder hitboxes. Valve needs to add 128 tick servers for match-making games and we need way more stats and in-depth graphs of our own performance on our profiles. Some weapon still needs some tweaking (AWP got nerfed too hard, hafl-way from now and older AWP would be perfect) and some pistols are still a bit too OP. All and all tho, even with these problems it's still a great game - however, if in the long run Valve doesn't take care of these major things and just keeps up the cosmetic side of CSGO I can see the community getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in the long run, but they're smart so hopefully it won't happen.Overall I give this game a 8/10 - that could be a 9/10 if they fixed the hitboxes/weapons and a  10/10 if we had 128 tick servers and more analysis.Cheaters are a HUGE problem of this game, so I also hope that Valve would seriously expand the VAC team. I stopped playing mm for this reason now mostly 10mans and faceit.			"

They're making the game much more better!#3- The ""Operation"" events! They're selling access for these events and making so many maps and some bonus case drops whoever joins the operation events, and they're fun! - I think there're like 3 events already finished and one is still alive!CONS;#1- CHEATS! I really can't imagine how Valve can't stand against all these cheaters.. There are so many cheaters in this game like in every other FPS game.#2- BAD SERVERS!

												Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet Unlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC.If you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Mods, mouse and keyboard, and the usual PC-only options are better than the ports. Plus, Valve is much better about long-term PC support -- it abandoned Team Fortress 2 on consoles, and Portal 2's level editor was PC exclusive			"

												Too many things are wrong in this game,movement is not smooth, awp quickscope and deagle are innacurate and not fun to play anymore, p90 and running is♥♥♥♥♥♥ flashes are not efective,  nades are not accurate, limited wallbanging and stupid ammo limitation on M4/USP, burst fire on FAMAS is useless, maps cluttered with unexpected props and corners to slow you down and block nades, certain areas are not wide enough and causes acidental TK on rushes and inability to rush fast as an whole favors CT play, and the most important, recoil does not allow you to kill multiple enemies in 1 magazine in a short period of time, you are limited to short bursts and take cover, and that removes the ability to clutch rounds which was the most fun aspect in other versions. It prevents good skilled aimers from carrying a team. Skill ceiling is way lower than it was in CS 1.6 and shot hitreg is mostly random, even if you aim perfectly at the head, there is always a luck factor and you can always miss the shot, unless at extremely close ranges. Skill is not so important and instead favors using tons of smokes and nades to deplete time for Terrorists, and T´s cannot do much about it since nades and flashes are so weak in this version.Also most maps are really bad unbalanced copies of CSS maps, like inferno and train, and people are forced to pay for operation passes to play extra maps in matchmaking.On the other hand there are many improvements in money and weapon balance specially on ecos, (altough pistols/shotguns are still overpowered and other misc stuff like the GUI, matchmaking and de_nuke balanced, and I would rather play GO with this problems fixed than going back to 1.6 anyday, but at this moment the game is not fun anymore and gameplay is not fully oriented for competitive gameplay.I only play it because nobody plays the other versions anymore, and most people have to eat it up.This game had very low player count before the steam market update since the game was really bad, but after it many people started playing it to earn skins, so most of the players dont care about the game, they just idle for drops and watch streams to know on wich teams to bet on csgolounge, they dont actually care about the game, it is a sad truth and its clear that Hidden Path will never update this game to proper conditions.

												It's different than previous installments in the series. The recoil of the weapons is dramatic and infuriatingly unreal looking. It's very possible to almost completely miss a target standing in front of you at no more than 1 meter (gamewise meter) and deliver only one hit with the AK. The AWP for example isn't the surgical instrument of death no more. The shoot area isn't a dot (the dot in the center of your reticle) but a quite large ""box"".  Also the physics of it seem a bit off, I cannot understand how you can be stopped from running from being hit with a smoke grenade, HE grenade, flash bang or molotov/incendiary. It is ridiculous and reminds me of the old stuck-in-the-ground with smoke launched at feet bug in Counter-Strike 1.4. I have the frustrating sensation that I am constantly playing a BETA game, a BETA I have purchased.  Also lots of cheaters in Competitive matches. Competitive matches were supposed to be the bread and butter of the new series but the experience is very often destroyed by obvious cheat using players. I guess it is so easy to cheat in this game since there are lots of them. The Overwatch isn't helping much and participating in the Overwatch program ruins the faith in this program because 4 in 5 demos submited to Overwatch have players blatantly using wallhack. I guess the Overwatch can VAC ban one and while 10 more players start using it.In spite of all it has potential, it looks good and the maps, the old ones and the new ones added, are interesting and fun to play.Later edit* VAC ban waves seem to have no effect. I found a site which sells amibot/wall hack for 30$ and provides new steam account with CS:GO in it in case of VAC Ban. :(			"

I don’t like how literally every gun can headshot from any range. I don’t like the high entry level the game has before you can “git gud”. I don’t make friends with people who play CSGO because different personalities.Raw Fun > ESPORTS POTENTIAL[/minority opinon]			"

												What I like:In CS:GO (Counter Strike: Global Offensive) I love how there are camos/skins on weapons because no other game is like it. I also love how they're are a workshop where you can create skins, maps, stickers, ect. CS:GO also has a lot of people playing it so if you are playing on a random server, you are guaranteed to have other players on there. The fact there are servers ""you"" can make.What I dislike:The fact there are smurfs that play with silvers and just make there games horrible. I mean this is not me since I'm not in Silver I'm Master Guardian, but that has nothing to do with this review. Anyways I dislike how they removed Operation Vanguard from the maps because I loved Season and Workout a lot. I know you can still get the maps off the workshop and still play it, but it's just not the same. I think valva should add more things to do in the tutorial so begineers understand more about the game.Sorry if this review is not good, I have exactly made a review about a game before.			"

												This version of Counter-Strike aims to unify the Counter-Strike 1.6 and Counter-Strike: Source fans into a new iteration of the classic First Person Shooter. The casual mode is, while fun most of the time, a bit lacking in meaning to any halfway serious gamer. The competitive (classic ranked matchmaking) mode is extremely competitive, with most players simply looking to rank up at any cost, or simply not rank down at worst. Hackers and smurfers run fairly rampant in competitive, and can be a large deterrent to serous legit players. The game is updated fairly often, with new operation map packs available perhaps twice a year, carrying with them the added excitement of new skins for weapons in the game.Overall the game is a blast, whether you just enjoy FPS's to shoot things, or create an elite team capable of conquering the world.

												Valve could've made this a good game, but they simply fold under the pressure of the community too much these days.The original Counter-Strikes (including Source) were all good fun to be had, pretty well designed and balanced, but GO went the wrong direction.First off, (and to be frank the only thing this review will discuss so as to simply give you a general idea of my point)  Spraying AKA a bullet's feverish disobediency of the barrel that it's shot from  - this is a big gameplay mechanic which as far as I know was hardly if ever present in the originals (was much harder to do or just impossible) and just lemme preface this review with saying that I'm not allergic to changes, I'm allergic to bad game design.This mechanic is quite powerful as knowing exactly where your bullets will end up can let you fire full auto with laser rifle accuracy, and this opens up the possibility of a huge skill gap out of nowhere. They wanted to allow players the ability to play Counter-Strike LESS competitively, and this feature which was pretty much totally absent in the past but in normal play this has become a staple.Counter-Strike has such a huge skill gap from the moment you rank up that it demands from you a competitive mindset whereever you go. And this is all because of the mechanics like, and the design that supports, spraying..  The point of games is that merely playing them is where you get the fun from, and a well-designed game can allow even disadvantaged players who don't care to have fun.   I've heard before of the internet mocking the phenomenon of casual gaming and I can assure you, I don't like my games to be too easy. The beauty of a fun game is a balance of struggle and fun. It's just that Counter-Strike demands too much of the former and gives way to only a tiny smear of the latter.			"

Especially for smurfs, many who wish to rank up higher in competitive but simply can't due to the number of smurfs who are actively cockblocking them. and as for hackers, there are those who use it for personal gains or to use it to sell people ranking up services these people are a real pain to the CS:GO community- ELO system is weird had a friend that ranked up after every single win in competitve he is the mvp after every round but i still see no logical explanation of ranking up after 1 game being won in competitive. - Matchmaking really bad matchmaking system they have in CS:GO what i can say about the matchmaking system it is a mess literally they just dump random people of weird ranks as your opponent while your own team are beautiful silversTake this for instance lost 1 game and next round this happend to me my opponent have 4 gold nova master and a Master guardian I and my yes my team 4 cute little silvers and i am the only gold in that team Lost the game obviously but lost as the top player at the end of game and guess what? I deranked, deranked just because i lose 2 games in a row and logically speaking the second game won't affect my mmr that much but i derank.Enough said I would recommend this game if you don't mind meeting a wave of cockblockers that are filled with hackers, smurfers and a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ matchmaking system otherwise don't get this game simple.

												This game was the best tactical game I had ever played. The community was good, people were mature, sportsmanship was very well presented.But all of that changed when the skins came. The community of Counter Strike that we knew and loved got shattered in an instant. This community is turning into TF2 but instead of hats it is skins. It's a pathetic excuse from valve to build an economy to make more money off of virtual items. Really valve? You are turning this game into TF2 and it's a joke. More immature underage children are playing this game now and I don't like and I am certain that I am not the only one who thinks this way.First off, the community now is a disgrace. You could be playing with someone, become really good friends with them and then they ask for one of your good skins to ""borrow"". BAM! Skins stolen and your hard work has meant nothing. It increases the scamming within this steam community.Second, the competitive mode is great. It is challenging and very teamwork based, but all that can change with a steam sale. Hackers banned? Well then let's price Counter Strike: Global Offensive to £3.50. Oh boy that was a good idea right? A steam sale on this game is not only hurting us but steam as well. People also buy Counter Strike: Global Offensive on a different account, so that means if you are a low rank in competitive not only are you against a higher rank but you are also at a high chance to lose. It's a complete and utter disaster when it happens. It needs to end.Thirdly, Cases are ridiculous. You literally have a 0.01% chance to get a ""Rare special item"" (Knife). People waste so much money on cases when at the end of the day it's a ""Virtual Item"". You could go out and buy a real knife for about £50 at highest while the highest in this game is about £600. The economy is terrible. Community is terrible. Skins are a joke and Steam are probably laughing at you as you go out and waste money on cases.Fourthly and lastly is the, ""Hit Detection"". This game has a pretty bad hit detection system. Valve could go out and buy 124 tick servers but nope! they go out and be cheapskates and buy 64 tick servers which is god awful. I mean Valve, Come on! You make millions of £ and $, why can't you actually just think about your game instead of how much money you take a bath in? This game is great once you get into it and ""IF"" you find a decent server (124 tick) it is pretty fun. One other thing I forgot to mention is when you play competitive there is a cooldown if you ""leave"", ""Kill a teammate"", ""Kick too many players"" or even if your power cuts during a match, you only have ""3 minutes"" to return to the match. Abandon the match? Ok sir we give you a 7 day ban. A ban ranges from 30 minutes to 2 hours to 24 hours to finally 7 days. It is a bit unfair the banning system. It is automatic so it cannot be revoked. Please Valve, fix your game and your community before it wrecks itself. 6/10 for Gameplay2/10 for Skins3/10 for Community0/10 for Competitive Cooldown "

												Initially I was very hesitant about this game; it seemed very risky to make so many fundamental changes to a formula that was barely changed through Counter-Strike: Source and Condition Zero. However, seeing how much Valve has listened and continues to listen the community, and how quickly they make changes in both the short and long term, it has completely restored my faith in the game. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is incredibly fun and feature-rich, with plenty to do for both casual and competitive players. On top of this, there is also plenty of ways to promote and support eSports, which is a much-needed and fundamental step in reinvigorating Counter-Strike in the competitive gaming scene. However, the most important thing with this game is that the community is incredibly nice and friendly - and with a game as difficult and intense as Counter-Strike, it's extremely welcoming. Good stuff!			"

												If you can manage to get past the idea of russian and turkish kids spamming their microphones and trolling in every competitive match, Cs:GO is actually a good game. I won't go into details as I think everybody has heard of the Counter Strike franchise, and if you played the previous games or even if you are a new player, this game is the perfect place for veterans and beginners alike, as the ranking system is really good compared to the other online games out there (of course you'll get your daily dose of ""I am silver but play like a global elite"" players, but don't hate on the game, hate on the toxic parts of its community). It is a well-priced shooter for the countless hours you are probably going to spend playing it. My only complaint would be the importance players think skins have (yes, they are beautiful, but they are damn useless), problem that spawns a new species of player: the one who bought Cs:GO only to open cases and brag to his friends about what skins he got,literally not even playing the game, only marketing skins. Just don't.			"

												Well, I have been playing CS for the last 10 years, over 10,000 hours on 3 accounts (3000 hours in cs go). I had a lot of fun, but with the release of the glove update, I understood, that CS GO community and Valve no longer care about the players, and are just in there for the money. In every game there is a 90% chance that you will either get a cheater or a smurf, and what does Valve and CS GO community do about it?? they release new cases. Before this game used to be fun, and after a hard day, I would come and enjoy a few rounds with my friends, but now instead of fun I get stressed with all the cheaters. It is really sad to watch a downfall of such a gaming giant as CS, but this is was greed does to the best of us.  I DO NOT RECOMEND TO PLAY THIS GAME			"

												Counter-Strike: Global Offensive took the long way to success. It started off with a number of significant flaws, but with time and some substantial patches, has become one of the most-played games on Steam and one of the best PC games you can play.As usual, the people who know the game best are the ones who spend every night and most weekends in the trenches, defusing bombs, shooting chickens, and desperately hunting for knives. Also as usual, the people who love the game most are also the ones who have the most complicated relationship with it. Play a game enough, and even if you love it, part of you will probably start to loathe it. In a loving way. If that makes sense.Generally speaking: CS:GO players love the chickens, are flummoxed by the knives, are in agreement that Dust2 is in some ways the game's only map, and hate hackers almost as much as they hate being called hackers. And of course, like any good game, for all the complaints most people have, they still can't stop playing.			"

												The latest installment in Valve's Counter-Strike series brings us great, addicting gameplay, a colourful, alive world in a game that combines great mechanics, with great performance. It is my second most played game, soon to become the first. The item drop system is similar to the one in Team Fortress 2. At the end of a match you may or may not receive an item. A skin, a weapon case, you never know !    The best way to play, is to play competitively. The game has a Matchmaking system, that finds you a nearby server to play on, with 9 other players to fill your 5v5 match. This is where you have to play good, where you have to win.   After your first few matches, you will be given a Skill Group. That, is your rank. It's based on your  K / D ratio, and the amount of wins and consecutive wins you've had in previous matches. The Matchmaking system's job is to match you with players of your level. If you don't wanna play serious, though, you can still hop in the thousands of servers with random stuff! Deathrun, Zombie Survival, Deathmatch, you name it! It's still tons of fun. But the real deal is in Competitive.    So, what are you waiting for? GET IT !Unsurprisingly, I give it a 10 / 10 "

COMMUNITY The biggest problem of this game.  Community is full of Russians, screaming kids, Russians and again, you won't believe me - screaming kids. About 80% (maybe more) of my games I played with Russians was pure cancer. They didn't speak English, just ""♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥"" and other sh*ts.  This also applies with kids - I don't know, how many times I heard 11/12 yo kids who f*cked my mother, funny :), isn't it? You can have a good score, like 36/15, you can win 9 rounds on harder side, you can sacrifice your soul to win, but still, with team score 14/9 on better side you can LOSE. Why, because they aren't able to do something good. Situations, when they want to kick you:They want to kick you, if you don't clutch 1v5.They want to kick you, if you don't speak their language.They want to kick you, if you are 30 seconds AFK. They want to kick you, if you are ahead of them.They want to kick you, if you are behind them. ( mostly if  they use only P90)They want to kick you, if you are 1v5 and you want to save an AWP or other expensive gun.AND STORY CONTINUES........I really recommend to find a friends and play together.SKINSIn game you can buy skins. Nice, you can ""upgrade"" your game how you want. But there fun ENDS. Do you want some beauty skin on an USP? - Pay about 5€!Do you want some beauty skin on M4/AK47? - Pay 10+€!Do you want some beauty skin on an AWP? - Pay  20+€!NOT ENOUGH? Do you want some beauty skin on Knife? -♥♥♥♥♥♥your wallet and bank account and PAY 300+€!!No, I am not kidding. 300€ for pixels into game, that costs 10€. Ridiculous? Yes, I know. VALVE's RANKING SYSTEMAnother thing you should know until you start play competetive. Believe me, rank in this game doesn't show your right skill. There are a lot of boosted accounts. You can get Rank-up if you are last with 2/10, but you can get Rank-down if you lose on first place with a good score. Even my friend got Rank-down AFTER WIN. Yes, it can happen, when you play competetive.VALVE ANTI-CHEAT SYSTEM (VAC) Of course, they improved it, but still VAC is quite broken. Because there are a lot of hackers. And how you going upper and upper, the worst it gets. SMURFSMaybe I should add this topic to COMMUNITY, but it's that important, so it deserves separated topic. I think, there are more and more and way more smurfs than before. It's a ""good feel"", if you get 3x oneshot headshot in row by 1 man. So, you want check out his profile, clearly for sure and then you see: Lvl 1 profile without avatar, only with 1 game - CS:GO with about 60/100 hours on it. I don't get, why do they create new Steam profile, buy CS:GO and play against weaker players. They gotta to kill lower ranks to get a higher ego? Why do they not play on FACEIT/ESEA? --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OK, if you want to get the cancer, but you dont even smoke and these included cons don't matter for ya - BUY IT! :)But the game itself is great :)MY OVERAL RATING - 5/10			"

Second , if you play this game with your friends , you'll get into it faster than playing SOLO , so its more fun with your friends instead of playing with randoms , then u'll try to be more better especially if you find a decent mates-team that plays with you , you'll start looking for some strats , then you'll play it more like serious.Third , for graphics , i dont really care about any game's graphics when its fun , but CS:GO's graphics are decent so there is no reason to complain about it.4th , its gameplay , that every COD player complains about it. especially 'recoil' its really hard to control it but that's the the game you need to practice with your recoil , and try to find out the best settings you can play with.And there is alot of good things about this amazing game but sadly i cannot write them all in one review .And there is some bad things about this game , like after every update some people start getting some weird lags , i think they need to fix it , and if you're looking to play this game more serious , dont play on MatchMaking servers , because its full of R_E_T_A_R_D_S and alot of trolls and its a land of AFKs , thats just made me feel mad , just go on esea , esl , leetway and so on , and one more thing , and its after about every steam sale , CS:GO become a land of cheaters , and thats just redicouless.The reason why I'm not playing much lately because I need to focus on better life decisions and many important things.Finally i hope you find this review a helpful review and thanks for reading.

TL;DR: STFU AND PLAY!Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is designed to be competitive and only competitive. If being competitive is your kind of fun, then this is definitely the game for you!Take note that if you have a high competitive rank, do not use matchmaking during or after Steam sales! You will be queued against blatant hackers who will just pull your rank down. Valve's method to address this issue is by limiting the wins of unranked players to 2 per day. This is supposed to make boosting services more expensive, but if your mom has the $$$ then it won't stop you from being a dumbass GE.As for lower ranked players, the only thing you should worry about when the game goes on sale are smurf accounts. Since the game was designed to heavily punish players for abandoning a match and to limit the range of skill groups, many players have resulted to purchase more copies of the game -- possibly a copy for each day of the week and for each range of skill groups. This is a flawed system created by Valve, and I doubt it will ever be fixed. Clearly, Valve just wants to sell hats -- or in this case, stickers.In my opinion, competitive cooldowns are stupid. Competitive cooldowns a.k.a. temporary bans are given to players who abandon a match. This is good for promoting competitive play and all, but the current implementation for detecting an intentional abandon is completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (ret4rded -- good job flagging this word,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. If you have random connection issues for a mere 5-10 minutes -- possibly due to terrible Internet Service Providers, this will immediately be considered an abandon, and you will not be allowed to help the four teammates you are clearly in a party with. If you are live streaming on Twitch.tv and get DoS attacked by one of your viewers, you will most definitely be given a 7 day cooldown every single time you live stream. If your game crashes in the middle of a match due to VPK errors and are forced to verify the integrity of your game cache, or if Windows Update decides it would be a good time to install updates and restart your computer... /gg.Whoever thought it would be a good idea to give a cooldown to a player who team-kills a bot in order to prevent it from giving away free guns and knife-kill rewards to the enemy? Please, for the love of GO, CS-GO KILL YOURSELF!!!CS:GO bots, just like in DotA2, are incredibly stupid no matter what difficulty you set them to. They rarely follow commands and will most likely give the bomb as well as their gun to the Counter-Terrorists. Bomber bots has been ""addressed"" in a previous update by allowing players to take the bomb from bots. The A.I. remains the same -- stupid and unresponsive.Overwatch is unreliable. Overwatch allows low ranked idiots with zero map awareness to be the judge whether a Global Elite is cheating or not. Valve's idea of being qualified and experienced enough to become an Overwatch investigator is based on numeric variables of your CS:GO activity. Basically, all you need are 150 competitive matchmaking wins, a decent rank (not Silver), 500 hours of your game idling in the background while you watch anime, and an account with low report counts (a.k.a. nobody reported you for being better than them at the game). If low report counts were to be the only qualification to be an investigator, then eventually, everyone skilled enough would have been reported by some newbie. Does this mean the newbies will be the only ones left qualified for Overwatch since higher ranked players were reported by idiots? Only time will tell...Overwatch is in a way pretty useful for detecting blatant all-out cheaters but extremely inadequate for spotting casual cheaters with minimal settings and who are very good at portraying Romeo and Juliet. This is because Overwatch only shows the investigator out-of-sync portions of the actual demo based on events triggered by the suspect. This makes it seem as though every suspect is using an aimbot especially with the low tickrate being used on the official matchmaking demos. Yet another waste of a very capable idea, Valve.On the bright side, competitive hostage rescue actually works really well compared to older versions of Counter-Strike. Carrying the hostage, instead of having the incredibly intelligent A.I. of every Valve game ever developed follow you with blindfolds on, makes the gameplay a lot more credible.For those of you who prefer playing casually, you are better off playing Counter-Strike: Source. I find CS:Source more casually fun due to smooth movement especially for kz, bhop, surf, and trikz style game modes. Sadly, the CS:Source community is now officially dead.It would be common for people to assume CS:GO being the cause of the dead CS communities; however, this is not the case. People get bored eventually, so they end up looking for something different to try out: a new game, a different genre, or even a different lifestyle. The only thing CS:GO did to these older communities is to possibly hold on to what is left of them by allowing them to merge as one. If Valve/Hidden Path were to introduce a matchmaking system in CS:Source and maybe even in CS 1.6, I am sure a lot of players would pick their preference.Clean bunny-hopping is possible on CS:GO if and only if you use hacks or server-side plugins with sv_enablebunnyhopping. Therefore, this may not be a game for all you BHop pros. Surf and air-acceleration still work though; however, it is not as smooth compared to CS:Source surfing especially on 64-tickrate servers. Not to mention, the game randomly stutters so much that it is impossible to do anything with precision and accuracy -- memory leaks?With the default value of sv_airaccelerate increased from 10 to 12, this makes it a lot easier to reach those certain jump spots that everyone enjoys doing. Good job, Valve! Now please increase the damn matchmaking tickrate or at least give us an option to choose! Speaking of options to choose, Valve has completely removed the sv_enableboost cvar which in turn killed the CS trikz community. /ripOverall, CS:GO is a good replacement for CS 1.6 fans and possibly for those CS:Source players who don't even know what air-acceleration does.

												CS:GO a game, that forces you to blow.Counter strike global offensive, is a sequel to a game not many mention, that is the more tame and passive counter strike source, or at least by comparison. When you get CS:GO you will immediately know, that you're gonna be bad and quickly get mad. And if you aren't aware of the haulage of rage in less than a minute, your ""teammates"" will acknowledge and flip it on.Never in my life, have I been in a situation where I wanted people from another nation to be on my team. Because with most of the american players, they do nothing but add layers of irritation and stress, mostly screaming kids or random mooks making bids for weapons while ignoring their dames, when they should be playing the game, that it causes such a mess.The main game is all the same. If you're a terrorist your goal is to blow up things, like a horrible chemist. If you're a counter terrorist, you'll find yourself defending one of two spots like a minimum wage therapist. Both teams do have an alternative option, that they aren't too furtive about. Everyone usually goes for this route, and just kill everyone on the other team without a doubt. This game is not new user friendly,  I dare say it is quite deadly to newbies. To sum things up, before I get mad and break a cup. It feels like everyone is a 5 year veteran, but you are some poor letterman that gets headshot instantly and spent more time dead than alive. Your accuracy is off like a dead battery, but every bullet from each enemy is specially graced by gaben to carve a mullet into your skull. It doesn't help, that this games community is rancid, if you dare yelp everyone will shout at you like you're a whelp. Not to mention the huge amount of smurfs, that make you feel like you're in detention. Don't even bother unboxing, because it is outright mocking you what little difference it makes. All you can get is a skin, which is as worthless as the bin you'll put it in. All the guns work, but apparently aren't as fun without bright colors stickers glowsticks or prickers. And don't dilude yourself that if you keep trying you'll get a knife, it'll be a very pitiful strife. And the worst part, that makes the first statement of this review meanginless?  This game makes you always feel bad, I rarely see anyone glad to be having fun at all. CS:GO makes you feel like you blow. There is one thing that is a big deal to the smurfs, that they gladly take and seal. But the problem that always hits without fail is, this game is always on bloody sale. So for 40 bucks, the average chucks can have about 8 accounts. So even if they do get a ban, it'll literally be like you threw a rotten tomato at a fan. Just more of a fuss that oozes from this toxic community, like a wound full of puss.You may ask yourself, ""why does this random delph still play it then?"" The answer is simple, like connect the dots with dimples. This game has challenge, and does need ""teamwork"" to make you do better than an allonge. Which you'll rarely get alone, it cannot be done. Bring a friend, because in the end it is better to suffer together rather than alone.Otherwise can't recommend.			"

Counter-Strike Global OffensiveI looked when I bought it, it was the 11.September 2013. Back then my opinion to this game was unbealiveable...Before I started playing CS-GO I played Call Of Duty on my playstation. CounterStrike was the first First-Person shooter I really got into it. It was incredible back then. I always played it with 4 other of my friends. It was such a cool experience, this tryhard feeling, the adrenaline when you clutched a round...Later we also got some tactics on some maps, we learned how to throw smokes and pop flashes. Some day we tried us in a Face-It tournement, we got rekt but it was something different...But then someday we got to the highest rank in the game ""Global Elite"". After that I really didn't know what to do: Should I just play more to get better? Should I start playing on Face-It or ESEA? I played some more games but then I took a break...My friends never really quit CS they always played...I tried some other games like League of Legends or a few Casual Games but none of them catched me like Counter-Strike did.Then I started playing again...And at some point I was getting better in the game but I didnt wanted to play till Global Elite again ( my rank was resetted because I didn't played for a few months) so I convinced my friends to buy a month of ESEA...It was really funny at the beginning. Especially as we qued against Tweeday at this match we were really tryharding ^^...But then at the end of the month there was this one question: Should we pay another 7$ for anti-cheat and this tryhard feeling? Is it worth?To be honest I don't think so...why should I pay extra for anti-cheat and a leaderboard? Why isn't this already in the game? I really love Counter-Strike it gave me the best experience for a first-person shooter then I've ever had...But Valve doesn't gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥about experience...I don't want cases, where I can get some extra special cosmetics for my ingame character. The prices of the skins are ridiculous. I don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about that, people can spend their money in what they want but Valve is concentrating on skins more then on ingame experience. Maybe I will start playing it again, when there are some good updates. But Counter-Strike is going towards a wrong direction...All in all Counter-Strike is the best first-person shooter you can find. Grab some friends and play some competetive rounds, but when you get to the highest point what the game is giving right now, there is in my opinion no need to play this game anymore. You have to wait till some new updates (updates which doesn't include adding some new cases and skins) will come...And this can take a long time....			"

Valve's idea of being qualified and experienced enough to become an Overwatch investigator is based on numeric variables of your CS:GO activity. Basically, all you need are 150 competitive matchmaking wins, a decent rank (not Silver), 500 hours of your game idling in the background while you watch anime, and an account with low report counts (a.k.a. nobody reported you for being better than them at the game). If low report counts were to be the only qualification to be an investigator, then eventually, everyone skilled enough would have been reported by some newbie. Does this mean the newbies will be the only ones left qualified for Overwatch since higher ranked players were reported by idiots? Only time will tell...Overwatch is in a way pretty useful for detecting blatant all-out cheaters but extremely inadequate for spotting casual cheaters with minimal settings and who are very good at portraying Romeo and Juliet. This is because Overwatch only shows the investigator out-of-sync portions of the actual demo based on events triggered by the suspect. This makes it seem as though every suspect is using an aimbot especially with the low tickrate being used on the official matchmaking demos. Yet another waste of a very capable idea, Valve.On the bright side, competitive hostage rescue actually works really well compared to older versions of Counter-Strike. Carrying the hostage, instead of having the incredibly intelligent A.I. of every Valve game ever developed follow you with blindfolds on, makes the gameplay a lot more credible.For those of you who prefer playing casually, you are better off playing Counter-Strike: Source. I find CS:Source more casually fun due to smooth movement especially for kz, bhop, surf, and trikz style game modes. Sadly, the CS:Source community is now officially dead.It would be common for people to assume CS:GO being the cause of the dead CS communities; however, this is not the case. People get bored eventually, so they end up looking for something different to try out: a new game, a different genre, or even a different lifestyle. The only thing CS:GO did to these older communities is to possibly hold on to what is left of them by allowing them to merge as one. If Valve/Hidden Path were to introduce a matchmaking system in CS:Source and maybe even in CS 1.6, I am sure a lot of players would pick their preference.Clean bunny-hopping is possible on CS:GO if and only if you use hacks or server-side plugins with sv_enablebunnyhopping. Therefore, this may not be a game for all you BHop pros. Surf and air-acceleration still work though; however, it is not as smooth compared to CS:Source surfing especially on 64-tickrate servers. Not to mention, the game randomly stutters so much that it is impossible to do anything with precision and accuracy -- memory leaks?With the default value of sv_airaccelerate increased from 10 to 12, this makes it a lot easier to reach those certain jump spots that everyone enjoys doing. Good job, Valve! Now please increase the damn matchmaking tickrate or at least give us an option to choose! Speaking of options to choose, Valve has completely removed the sv_enableboost cvar which in turn killed the CS trikz community. /ripOverall, CS:GO is a good replacement for CS 1.6 fans and possibly for those CS:Source players who don't even know what air-acceleration does.

												I have to say, originally, I did not want anything to do with this game. I have been a big fan of the series since starting with Beta 4 way back when. After CS:S was released, I was very content with the way the series had been progressing. The updated gameplay and graphics gave me a boosted interest in a game I had not played in several years. When Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was released, I was not feeling the same way. The frantic and well edited trailers made the game look spectacular, that is until I noticed it was still running on the source engine, albeit a modified version. Given the hefty price tag, I stayed away from CS:GO for as long as possible, until I noticed how many updates had been made since the first CS:GO beta, and the subsequent gold release. It was obvious, the developer planned on putting as much effort into maintaining the game as they were to keep the game fresh and even competitive. Once I finally bought the game on sale for a decent price, I realized what I had been missing. Competitive mode has changed the way the game feels and works. It was very easy to get bored playing CS:S, because as the popularity increased, so did the servers. Pretty soon you were competing against 32 players on the opposing team, making for a hellish free-for-all, despite the team based combat. CS:GO found the perfect solution by introducing a competitive game mode. Instead of having to play with your friends in 5v5 tournaments, CS:GO incorporated a 5v5 mode that mirrored the professional experience, making it a lot more fun to play. The fine-tuned competitive mode, coupled with officially supporting death match and the arsenal game modes, making CS:GO a game with a lot more re-playability, and a lot more fun.Some people are critical about the inclusion of skins, turning CS:GO into Team Fortress 2, but they fail to recognize the importance of customization. The skins don't really impact the gameplay, and are not overly obnoxious like some of the content included in TF2. In addition to the developer created content, the inclusion of community created weapon skins and operations allow community members to profit while increasing the awareness and fun of the game. I am not a fan of DLC, especially since most DLC is lack-luster overpriced content that should have normally been included in the game at launch, but was separated out to pay-for downloadable content in the interest of pumping out sequels and printing money instead of focusing on quality. CS:GO however, chooses community content to include, and gives back to the authors who continue to breath life into the game.Overall, I was skeptical when it was first released, but the developer's constant attention to detail and genuine intention to keep the game balanced and competitive has made this the best game in the series. I highly recommend fans of the series update to CS:GO and enjoy themselves.			"

												From the very beginning, i was conviced this game had potential. Now I'm slowly starting to see its other side.The only thing that matters to the developers is money and nothing else.They don't care about their community, all they want is your best: Your money.When you start to play this game, you will notice, that game modes like casual or deathmatch are crowded by suspicious players that seem to hit every shot and that know exactly what you are doing. Yes, I'm talking about cheaters.The problem with valve is they don't seem to care about this issue. All they care about is adding senseless stuff to the game like monetized sprays, skins and things that don't enhance your game experience.Things that have been requested by the community like 128 tick servers, a better anticheat or team matchmaking are not a top priority on Valve's To Do - List.One thing that has bothered me for a very long time is the community of this game: Even in higher ranks (LEM+ ) people flame you for their own mistakes. People don't seem to understand what this game is about. That's why you can only enjoy this game with a party of five friends that speek your language. Otherwise you'll encounter toxic britains, russians and other scum like german cheaters.It seems Valve makes more money with selling game copies to hackers and cheaters than with normal people who buy this game. That is why they won't improve their anticheat, cause their income is mostly based on skins and cheaters.Every now and then people get banned, but I've heard rumors that some cheat providers are undetected since 12 months or even longer. CS:GO only grew because skins and ingame monetisation was added to this game. With it's growth all the scum appeared.Apart from that you mostly have to pay extra for third party services like ESEA (which is 6,99$ per month) to truly enjoy this game.To summarize:Thus I can't recommend this game for any new people, you can enjoy it with your friends. But bear in mind that Valve isn't the most consumer frienly company. All they care about is your money and not your ingame experince.			"

												This game was one of the best out there. I repeat: WAS! Can't recommend this anymore due to the immature community which reports you for every lucky headshot, and then you have the possibility of getting reviewed by some idiot Overwatcher and, when you're having the best time...VAC ban. Please, Steam, stop discounting this product and stop caring only about your wallet. You're giving hackers and smurfers more chances to ruin this fine masterpiece of CO-OP gaming.P.S.: I know 99% of you won't give a s**t on my opinion, but who cares about you gamers anyway. :)			"

												CS:GO is probably one of the best multiplayer shooters out there, it offers such great gameplay and wide variety of gamemodes and maps to choose from. Counter-Strike has been around since 1999, and has grown since then. CS:GO may not please every 1.6 fan, but it has a lot to offer to the Counter-Strike scene. It has official competitive matchmaking, and supports the eSports scene of Counter-Strike. Most Counter-Strike major tournaments are hosted by GOTV and other sources like Twitch (which you can find on the main menu). It offers a ton of new gamemodes you made of heard before like ""Arms Race,"" (AKA Gun Game) and ""Deathmatch,"" (An all out Free-for-all). These gamemodes make Counter-Strike more friendlier to the casual players of the game. The old gamemodes are back in the modes Casual and Competitive. Casual is mostly for pub servers because it offers a more casual experience to the standard Counter-Strike gametypes like de_ (Bomb defusal) and cs_ (Hostage rescue) by turning off team-killing, always buy the essential equipment like Defusal kits and head armor. In the Competitive gamemode, it brings out the standard Counter-Strike competitively accepted settings. (some are modified like: Bomb time not being 35 seconds and instead being 45) This gamemode is for people who want to queue up with their friends and have a serious match with other players in competitive. Team-killing is allowed and many other hardcore settings to please the competitive audience. You might say to yourself, ""Well, since teamkilling is on, doesn't that mean people can grief in competitive?"" Valve has implemented ways to stop griefers and trolls from ruining the game experience. Everytime you team-kill someone, you get a competitive ban that can go up to 7 days, and even a year, which means you can not play the competitive gamemode for how long it lasts! Valve also has its own community Overwatch service, which detects cheaters and griefers. Overwatch lets you watch competitive games and see if someone is griefing or not. The Overwatcher determines if the person is griefing or hacking. Then, the report gets send to Valve for a final confirmation. This has helped the CS:GO community get rid of hackers and griefers off of the competitive scene. Speaking of the community, the CS:GO community is pretty friendly when it comes to new players. Most veteran players are willing to help out to teach everyone the basics of the game if they are having trouble. Many guides on the steam community guide page teaches new players on how to handle weapons and such. I rate this game 10/10, this game is near perfection when it comes to multiplayer shooters and it is a must have for every steam account.			"

Introduction:Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a multiplayer FPS game where you are either part of a Terrorist organisation or part of a team of Counter-Terrorists. The aim of the game is to work together with your team to defeat the opposing force. Even with many new maps, weapons and features, this game still has some classic maps and guns from the older Counter Strike games.Pros:-Over 20 different weapons to choose from.-Many game modes including casual, death match, arms race, competitive and more.-Unique skins and possible drops at the end of each match.-Operations that feature new community-made maps and skins.Cons:-Trolls, hackers and smurfs can ruin a competitive match.-In general, the game does not have a very friendly/kind community.-Some in-game items/features can be quite costly.-Competitive bans may last as long as a week.Overall:CS:GO can be addictive at times and is a lot more fun when playing with friends. The graphics are nice and I personally enjoy the music/sounds. Communicating and working well with your team can be a huge advantage to the game, but there are those who prefer to stray away from the rest of their teammates and play by their own rules. My rating would be an 8.5/10.			"

												Ah Counter-Strike. What a wild mistress you are. At times you are loving and caring, offering great joy and hope. Then other times you are mad at me for reasons I do not understand and you cast me out; alone and unloved. First off, let me quickly say that the game mechanics are great. Every gun handles differently and you have to learn each one. It takes skill and practice and makes the game so much more rewarding. As a side note however, it's a bit irritating when you can only see a guys head (i.e, the gun is hidden behind a wall or something) and they can still shoot you. But I digress!So in this game you have a few different modes that you can play, and each one has a very different play style. For instance, in Arms Race, there is no time to be subtle. You need to get 27 kills before the next guy, and you have to do this with every weapon in the game. As soon as you kill someone, your weapon switches out. This can be annoying if you're fighting several people at once, but the game is so fast paced that it really doesn't matter if you die. Instantly respawn and rush back into the field. The speed of this game makes it great for some community banter. You play in a team, but as you are really only playing for yourself, it doesn't matter if your team are doing well or not. I'll come back to this point about teams later.Team Deathmatch is a fairly standard affair if you are familiar with any other FPS game. People spawn in and you have to kill them before they kill you. Simples! As this game mode is slower than Arms Race, you can afford to be a bit more patient. There is a timer instead of a ""reach this many points/kills."" Also, every now and then a bonus weapon appears, in which you'll get more points if you kill people with that. Respawn with this weapon and kill people within the time limit and you'll bag yourself some extra points. Person with the most points at the end wins. Again, this is a mostly light hearted game mode, and the community really shines through.Next up is Demolition, my least favourite mode. It is much the same as the casual/competitive maps in which you have to try and plant a bomb, but the maps are smaller. The main difference in this game mode is you don't get to choose your gun. You start with a weapon and then when you kill someone in a round you change weapon at the start of the next round. Kill several people and you will be awarded with some grenades as well. The reason I dislike this mode is people can get out of sync with the weapons. If you do really well for several rounds, likelihood is you will now be on a weaker gun, or a gun you cannot personally use well. While it's good to get practice in, the realisation is that the other team can simply be on better weapons, leaving you at a major disadvantage. Again, after a few rounds they may be on a gun that they can't use and it levels the playing field again, but those few rounds can really be an irritant.  Now we are onto the meat and two veg. The bit the mistress both loves and despises. Competitive. In my time playing CS I have went from an absolutely horrendous player, having never really played many FPS's, to a fairly competent player. Over the space of a few months I went from unranked up to Master Guardian 1. I felt very proud of myself. However, the journey was not plain sailing. When entering a competitive mode, if you are not searching with friends, you can end up with wildly different experiences. This is where the community behind CS can really fall apart.In a match with strangers you can have a great match with excellent communication (which is really needed in competitive) or have really bad communication and a lot of name calling. If you make a mistake, sometimes you will be supported with a lot of ""Unlucky, we'll get them next time!"" or you will receive something along the lines of ""OMG, YOU SUCK, NOOB, FFS, UNINSTALL."" This is particularly true if you're the last one left alive and all eyes are watching you. This isn't just from your team however. I have had games where I have had great communication with the opposition, and everything has been really friendly, but well fought. Othertimes however, they are raging across the keyboard at you. Yes, you can mute players, and often you may have to mute the opposition, but it is quite another to mute your team. As I said, communication is really important in a competitive match. Even if they are only yelling obscenities at you, they may occasionally have insight into where a player is. A main problem for this is it doesn't even matter if you are winning or losing. Your team could just be massively unhelpful. I have had a lot of fun playing competitive matches, however as time goes on it is becoming less and less fun. This could be because of all the steam sales, with people buying the game and jumping on just to be irritating. Maybe they had been banned previously and have made new accounts or some such thing. It just doesn't make for pleasant gaming however. I don't play games to become annoyed and irritated. I play them as a release. There is nothing more satisfying than doing something well. I remember playing a game on inferno as the terrorist and I had went up B. I was to push up and give them a fright while my team was to go up A. As I went up Banana, two guys came down to me. I headshotted them both. It was then that my team were shouting down the headsets. They had lost the bomb at top of middle. Only one team member had survived. He went to try and get the bomb and was instantly killed. I was on my own with 3 opponents left. I turned back round at banana and went up middle. Two were coming towards me and I take them out. Sadly, I was down to 12 health now, and the clock was ticking. I knew that the last guy was up on the left at top of middle. So I went through appartments silently. As luck would have it, a team mate of mine had a smoke grenade that had dropped there. I threw the smoke into top of middle and as it burst out I went for the bomb, with 30 seconds left to plant. The final enemy started spraying into the smoke and I knew where he was. I shot once and killed him, acing the round (or kill every enemey yourself). I've had aces before, but that one was special. My teammates errupted with cheers, as that was a very important round for us. Had we lost we would have had to eco (which is to not buy so you can save some money). It was those cheers and the great support that my team gave me that makes me love this game. The community can be incredible.A quick note about casual is that it is pretty much identical to competitive, except with more players and thus less strategy and communication. Instead of only talking to your team, you are often talking to everyone in the game. The same issues with the community stand however. Sometimes they do a ""clutch or kick"" where the last surviving member of a team has to kill all the surviving members of the other team and win the round. This can be damn near impossible if your team didn't manage to do anything. This is often said when it's 5v1 or over. Often the community doesn't really kick the person, but I have seen it happen. I have also seen someone clutch a 6v1 and then got kicked regardless. So it's a bit of a hit and miss.Overall, I would highly recommend this game. The mechanics are solid and the community as a whole is really great. The support people give is wonderful. Often there is great banter to be had in the non-ranked matches. Sometimes banter can come into the ranked matches, but more and more of late it has just been abuse. If you want to try your hand at competitive you will need a thick skin.			"

												This game is valve's attempt to cash in on the CS franchise name while doing nothing to add value to the game besides stupid cosmetic stuff. The same crap that ruined team fortress 2. A matchmaking system for tryhards? Oh there aren't a million of those already in existence for the other CS games - the ones that actually were competative - that work a hell of a lot better.  This is valve's strategy now - do nothing, sell, profit. This game is, for all intents and purposes, the worst CS ever made. It's a reskin of CSS with a whole lot of bugs and technical issues. But fall for the trap if you want to play valve's game!			"

												After a long game remains ambiguous feeling. On the one hand, the game has become much more complicated with respect to Source. On the other hand, it seems that with all this GO more ""sharpened"" for beginners. Clearly this question is not answered, only time will tell.Quality study of maps, skins and models of weapons pleased. The graphics got better, but the game still will be able to run on a huge number of computers around the world, and will not be selected for pampering.The balance of the game developers have managed to maintain, in spite of all the innovations that have definitely shaken him badly.Following the results of the game can be put 8 out of 10 and recommend it for purchase			"

												Οne of the most prominent multiplayer fps right now Counter Strike:Global Offensive is also one the most renowned! The recipe of success for this game was very specific and it is not neccesarily related only to its visual part or the sound effects. The technical sector works fine and will leave everyone contented! Nevertheless its charm is located to the intriguing way it puts you to cooperate with other players and deal with various scenarios either you belong to the terrorists or to the counter-terrorists. Additionally there is a big variety of different levels and modes where you are called upon to put your reflexes to the test and stressful situations demand speed and effectiveness! On the whole i strongly recommend this game if you are on the lookout for a Multiplayer FPS which is not only realistic but also fascinating.			"

												Computer based tactical shooter. Extremely high skill if you're willing to put in the effort you will be rewarded.Russian players is a big problem for everyone in the matchmaking... so I'd recommend anyone for ESEA there isn't a lot of them ;)I met a lot of wonderful people in this game (friendship forever: P)10/10 !

Pros- Great maps- Team focused- Fun custom servers- Skill based- Become a pro and make a living playing for a team and playing tournaments/majors (Esports)Cons- Smurfs (Master Guardians playing in Silver, Distinguished Master Guardians playing in Gold Nova, Legendary Eagles playing in Master Guardians, Global Elites playing in Legendary Eagle, etc.)- Scammers- Toxic Children- Mic spammers- Russians will bottom frag and yell at their team to play better- Very Addicting- Everyone is egotistic- Hackers- You'll top frag and carry your team but wont rank up because the ranking system is based on how often you win, not how well you perform- VERY difficult to rank up, VERY easy to derank.- Poor balancing- Doesn't have 128 tick servers- Poor hit registration- Toxic community- People will rage quit after losing 2-3 rounds- No one wants to work as a team, everyone wants to be a pro- Everyone thinks getting frags is more important than winning rounds- Players often mistake friendly criticism for toxic trash talking and will become toxic themselvesThe Cons ruin the game. Smurfs and hackers make MM (matchmaking) unbalanced, and make it harder for you to improve and rank up. Many Silvers who should be Gold Nova, many Gold Novas who should be Master Guardians. People will accuse someone as being a hacker or a smurf because they play well and carry their team, but often times the good players cant rank up because better players are smurfing and keeping them held down in the lower ranks.For me, personally, smurfing is the biggest issue I encounter. Either the other team is being carried by a team of smurfs (2-3) or I will have smurfs on my team throw the game because they are trying to derank.Also, since the ranking system is based on how often you win, and not how well you personally perform, you have to pay the price for losing and derank with the smurfs.Also if you are playing with people lower ranked than you, (ex: you're GN3, friend is Silver 4) you will derank within 1-2 losses if you lose.It is also almost required for you to have friends to play with, because in MM there are many players who queue on a regular basis, meaning they are better coordinated. (Coordinated team vs 5 stranger team)And everyone who seems to be searching for a team are Silver 3 - GN1 or GN4 - LE. Sucks trying to find a team around the ranks of GN2-G4 when the only people offering to become a team with you are the players who are worse skilled.You can win 8 games, and no rank up.You can lose 4 games, and you will derank.Other people seem to have more issues with playing with toxic russians, toxic children, hackers, and hit registration.There are WAY too many issues with this game that Valve refuses to address. The updates they make are cool, but don't fix the game.They add a lot, but don't fix the game.Rating: 4/10 "

(Nobody asked for new Gloves wtf)- Smurfs / cheaters can buy this game for under 10 $ -> too many cheaters / smurfs			"

It just all works so well, the gunplay feels fluid and is unforgiving. If you don't have your aiming down, you are going to get owned.

												Human immunodeficiency virus infection / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is a disease of the human immune system caused by infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).[1] During the initial infection, a person may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness. This is typically followed by a prolonged period without symptoms. As the illness progresses, it interferes more and more with the immune system, making the person much more likely to get infections, including opportunistic infections and tumors that do not usually affect people who have working immune systems.HIV is transmitted primarily via unprotected sexual intercourse (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding.[2] Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV.[3] Prevention of HIV infection, primarily through safe sex and needle-exchange programs, is a key strategy to control the spread of the disease. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. While antiretroviral treatment reduces the risk of death and complications from the disease, these medications are expensive and have side effects. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the HIV subtype.[4]			"

												Counter strike for kids! I mean.....(Activates deep manly voice) Counter strike GLOBAL OFFENSIVE  - it now includes unrealistic cartoony weapon skins perfect for that awsome Tactical anti-terrorism immersion that you can buy by using your mom's money!This game comes free with : More hackersAlot of ppl screaming and cursing in russian.People who claims they have slept with your mother.Unfair matchmaking.Tons of updates.But realy now: The game fixed alot of issues 1.6 had and makes it one of the world best competetive game ever. I'm glad they added the workshop until i found out that the only way to use an item in the workshop is when it gets imported by Valve in the game.So that is one problem.Instead of doing it the way left 4 dead 2 was doing the workshop became a toy making factory because the majority of the people upvotes Borderlands 2 style of weapon camo's.You will finaly see yourself spending alot of hours consentrating on the screen and doing workout with your fingers. When i bought the game it was playable on my laptop with around 40-75 fps. After the workshop update it got worse every time. now i can barely get 30 fps.If there was a way to dissable all the distracting skins and give fps a boost i would buy itTry out insurgency, its a great game to step over from arcady style of shooters			"

												One of the best ""modern"" shooters. As long as you dont define a good fps game something simmlar to another game (for example CoD series or some other fps) this game will be awesome. If you expect awesomley thrilling SP campaign - No. you cna play with bots. but the gameplay may seem ""outdated"". It is nostalgic, not outdated. It has taken some of the best FPS game features and compined it with CS 1.6 and CS:S. great competiteve excperience. Servers sometimes might not be the best for competiteve experience, but there are some free, better server alternatives. You will not like the game if you expect something like huge map invasions like in Planetside 2 or BattleField series. it has awesome team play elements, hard controlable gun recoil. This game is everything you want if you haev the time to actually learn it, and understand the simplest principals of how it works. after that, It is just practise of aiming and teamplay. Awesome game. 9/10			"

												This game was awesome until Valve seriously efd it up! The skins the  Microtransactions  Oh my god are horrible. You make me pay 13.99 for the game okay. I can buy cases and keys alright. But why are the rare things so rare? I have 2% to get the knife? (I'm not sure.) Okay then you may say don't buy  cases. But if i won't buy cases and i don't have skins im being accussed of  Hacking!  because I have no skins and even if I have 245+ hours on the game I'm a hacker because skins = skills yeah am I right? And then we can get banned because of that. Okay so the Graffiti DLC or whatever came out but Valve why do you charge me more money for the god damn graffitis? That is literally the worst way to get some money! The old CS:GO was so much better so I'm gonna tell you what i want to change or be added in the game.Remove some microtransactions or make the skins be obtainable in some way I don't care how just make some skins be obtainable because the player played the game.or just do something like: M4A4 I Asiimov Level 25 Required or something and then let me get it or buy it for a decent price! Like 50% or something I don't care just something like this.Also make you know you can win some skins or cases on the end of the match yeah?So make a chance to get a key there again I don't care the chances of it but make it obtainable but the case with it can only contain only under the ""decent"" things that would be okay too.I don't have problems with microtransactions but I don't like when there are too much of them.CS:GO lovers will love the game but I think it's just all about the money all about microtransactions.Pretty much every update made the game worse like Valve wouldn't care.Players make the maps skins...Valve just adds them and if it looks cool then why not it will cost so much money that with that money I could live for a month. I have a knife i got it as a gift alright and I'm done of everyone trying to scam the knife from me for a 5.00 crap.I don't recommend the game until these stuff will be fixed or removed or some nice things will be added what will come next?Outfits?Animated Superduper rare stuff?More microtransactions?Premium ( 5.00/ month?)I just I just can't...The game is so horrible now I remember being the good player in the team the guy with 30+ kills but now... I wont even play it or just a little bit...Players just don't earn money like that Valve.I got reported multiple times ( They said it in the chat) for wallhacks or aimbot while i'm legit playing!Guess why?Right... I had no skins... "

												When I first started playing CS:GO I was a bit overwhelmed, not just because I was bad but because I couldn't communicate with anyone... It seems like everyone talks to eachother using just two words which are ""C y k a"" and ""B l y a t"", I was so confused.After a few hours of playing I felt confident I learned this new communication method, with thanks to типичная нуб.Before I knew it я получил better but Деньги not so good.Arms race это моя favourite игра mode. But I enjoy a мало конкурентоспособны too!All in all it's хорошая игра but большинство игроков россиян and/or грубый!Я рекомендую эту игру , он не идеален , но это удовольствие на некоторое времяThanks за чтениеТеперь, чтобы выучить английский язык снова ...

												I highly recommend CS:GO , Counter-Strike:Global Offensive to all my friends because of the low price and the high replayability. With just this cheap game you will be able to play 10 times the time you normzlly spend on a triple A (AAA).I like they spend equal importance on the individual skill as they do on the team play. For me, this is the only real tactical shooter on the market at this moment.I like the high variety of maps and weapons and that they dont stop updating it with new operations wich offer new free maps and the ability to support the developers by buying these expansions (wich is totally unnecesary to be able to fully enjoy the game).Theres not only a casual matchmaking but also a competitive matchmaking for people who take the game more serious. Theres weapon skins to collect and trade and cases to open to try ur luck. This game litteraly has everything an fps needs and fps fanatics want.			"

Excuse my accent.Basically, toxic community, gambling kids, balance problems, server problems and just overall starting to suffer the same problems other eSport games do. It's just not worth it anymore. Casual CS:GO is still fun, but really, you've got better things to do than play this.			"

												After more gamplay, about 24 hours, I can draw to a better conclusion.This game is not a bad game- its actually good.But it does have some flaws I dont like. Mostly with the community.ProsDoesnt require a high spec PCDifferent modesDifferent weapons for different teams (increases variety)Spray patterns add challengeCommunity maps and modes are all over the workshop, so theres alot of things to do.ConsCommunity is disrespectful, which completely ruins the game.For example, if you had a bad rank, (Silver, Recruit, etc.) Theyll probably act like youre some sort of noob at the game and cant play it at all. Remember how the CoD Community was apparently so toxic during MW2 and BO2? Imagine that, but 3 times as bad.Skins are WAY too important in this game. Skins and microtransactions should be something you do when youre bored, dont wanna buy a game, so you blow some money on random in game things. Not something that completely makes up the game itself. You cant go into a single round without seeing almost every gun spray painted like its a dress up game.Ranking system is AIDS. Not the ranks themself, just that it probably would take you 8 months just to reach Recruit 2. You  probably rank up higher in the actual military than this game.Last, the players will go out of there way to destroy and silence anyone who doesnt like their game. For example, look on the comments for this in a few weeks, itll become more cancerous than Chernobyl.Im not saying all of them are like this- just a majority who think that just because you dislike their game, youre either a CoD fan, a troll, or bad at it. They never think ""Huh, maybe this guy has an actual reason to dislike it. To each their own.""Final verdictIf you want a tactical shooter that requires you to think, work together, and use stealth, then go for it. Its got everything youd want, you can even hear footsteps, so thats another thing to control over. The amount of detail and features Valve put in is challenging, and keeps the game fresh.But if you want a good community with respectable players, keep looking. Thats not here.			"

 Counter-Strike: Global Offensive CS:GO, 4th episode of CS... ( Counter-Strike, CS:CZ, CS:S, CS:GO)My rating 9/10CS:GO is FPS Game, i think, that everybody knows CS, so we can move up to negatives and positives!Positives: Skins  (You can earn or lose money on skins, u can buy skins, trade skins, open cases and EARN money from that, almost same like TF 2, but much way better!) Ranks    - In game are few choices of types in game, From Arms race to competetive matches, when u must communicate, be skiller etc.  When are u playing competetive, and u are winning, u will earn new ranks, u can drop cause losing, or rank up if u are winning. U can start on Silver I and after 100h u can be global elite (Global Elite is the biggest rank) Gameplay  - Everything is smooth, good, awes00me. :D This is the main change i think, from CS1.6 and GO... everything is smoother, better headshots, competetive and more... its a really great game, not like CS 1.6... Tournaments  - If u are very good, and u got very, VERY good team, you can sign to the tournament, it can be the ""amateur"" tournament (Night cup etc.) or the best,bigger,famous DreamHack, Copenhagen games, EMS etc. U can win skins, money, new graphic card etc. etc. It´s really awesome!Neg4tives: Hackers    - Once per month will show some cheater... but dont worry, Valve and their VaC bans got this^^ RAGE    - When u are losing, lost your rank, got ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ team, its bad and u are starting to rage:D Kids    - This game... some kids buying this, dont know why, but when are u big rank (MG I etc) No kids in your team anymore^^If u like FPS Games, u played CS before (CS1.6,CZ or Source) You should buy this! Its awesome game!btw. Sorry for some gramatic fails, I´m from Czech, so i cant speak ENG like a pro^^			"

												My review for CS:GO will be mainly for the veterans of the Counter-Strike serie, which are cannot decide whether to play or not a new game.So what are interesting and new in CS:GO ???“Realism”: - When pistols 300 and 500 coins price (P250 and Five-seven) instantly kills man with helmet and armor at close range with a single bullet head shot, and a device price 3100 (M4) does not kills man with helmet and armor at any distance with head shot.- Snipers with SSG 08 kills enemy in jump (!) with a sniper rifle (!!). And it's not a luck / random - this is the norm in the CS:GO.- Snipers with the AWP that can walk in different directions with 8 kilo rifle with active scope and make kills. This is the norm in the CS:GO. At some 5x5 games number of AWP is 3 or 4 in team. (VALVE ignore players request make AWP like in 1.6 version).- Some ""brilliant mind"" in VALVE decides add to balanced CS game ... revolver what has same damage like AWP. About 3 years passed from creation, VALVE dont understand, that CS is not just a first person shooter like Half - Life, this a balanced tactic game.- Shooting in the game is completely different from version 1.6. Greatly simplified shoot from AWP. Greatly had reduced the accuracy of the AK-47, M4. Similar to the parameters M4 from 1.6 became M4A1-S added later, with even then it fixed by removing the damage. In CS:GO combat is now spray control from both sides, as at amateur and at pro levels.The question arises - why not just transfer the weapons and they parameters from 1.6 to CS:GO???- Armor piercing .... not bullets, in CS:GO we have armor piercing guns)Game “drop” and “funny” crates - When you play 1300 hours 10-15$ price game and had only consumer and industrial drop items. ONLY. In free to play Dota 2 drop any types of items. Before summer 2015 patch if you played many time, sometimes you may had 1 or 2 drop every day and many crates. But in summer 2015 some “genius” in VALVE decide to “improve” in CS:GO ""funny"" patch: now NO MATTER how many you play: 5 or 125 hours per week – all players have fixed drop – 1 gun skin, and 3-4 crates per week.In all different games are bonuses for players who play many time. CS:GO unique game where NO MATTER how many time players spend in game for items drop.- When you open 300 crates, and find ... 1 knife.“Progressive” rank system at 5x5 mod.- Nobody knows how it work)- You with friend bought CS:GO and decide to play 5x5 mod together? Don't hurry: if you have more higher rank that you friend has, you and friend ... can not play together, only 5 man can play having different ranks. If you do not have 5 players - you may never play together. CS:GO is unique game - if you bought game, not a fact, that you will play together 5x5 mod. - This system creates a people who really make CS:GO game ugly:-guys after account rank boosting (they pay to other player, and he boost rank) Guys after account rank boosting quite easy to calculate: for example, while playing kid with rank master guardian elite voice the kid 10 years old asks ""guys what is “eco round?”""; when the guy with the rank gold nova master plays ONLY PP Bizon /no armor; when a person with a rank legendary eagle playing with the same ranks as he has finished 0/2/24. How many games have been marred by such friends ""after the boost"" is not counted.- ""smurf"" - man who has a high rank, and creates a new account for fun/after the ban or for account rank boosting for other player)Of course there will be little pleasant when the map where plays silver rank players comes Smurf with real rank legendary eagle, especially for the team against whom it came. The most interesting is that the account boosting is quite a legitimate thing. Nobody cares that it may spoil the game for many people.For these problems has only one simple solution – hide the rank, for only game system can check you rank. Smurfs and guys after account boost will disappear forever. I don't believe that VALVE can not make this simple solutions since 2012.""Super"" anti cheat protects all VALVE servers))- ban cheaters after... 2-3 months game. (or don't ban in general)- VALVE agree that they have a useless anti cheat, and created Overwatch - option, where any player after 150 wins at 5x5 mod can ""judge"" cheaters. They don't create new normal anti cheat, they decide transmit all responsibility fight with cheaters on to players. Other VALVE “great” idea.  Awful game optimization. Don't be surprised, when you play Battlefield 4 in ultra quality graphics without any lags, but when You playing CS:GO in low quality graphics - game lags/ has freeze.   Awful CS:GO official VALVE servers. Veterans of the CS serie do not need to tell what it means to play on the server where tickrate, updaterate, cmdrate is 64.""friendly"" CS:GO community.- you play ""5x5"" mod. Taking first place with 4 russians in team all time uses foul language (want report them for this? no sense, because VALVE don't ban players for use foul language), and at last win round they....kick you.- kids screaming at microphone like a group of baboons.In summary we can say that the new game in the series has turned out an extraordinary, with its pluses and GREAT minuses. 100% i can say, if i knew all those minuses before start playing CS:GO , i never started play CS:GO. CS:GO - really worst game at all serie.Play CS:GO if you want spend some time playing with friends 5x5 just for fun.Play CS:GO if you don't upsets when you will be killed in the pit by jumping sniper from A plant (dust2 map).Play CS:GO if you don't upsets any game results.Play CS:GO if you don't care about awful game community.Play CS:GO if you don't care about game realism.Play CS:GO if you don't care about weapon skins and game items drop.Play CS:GO if you don't upsets cheaters playing versus you.5/10			"

												If im going to compare this, and CSS. I want to say, that CSS is more for the fun stuff, like: Minigame, Gungame, Surf, Ba_jail and ETC. But CS:GO, this game, its a really good game actually, in the start i was thinking it was bad. Well i was wrong, this game is very good, but i think its mostly for the competitive players. Btw, there is also a new game mode, demolution.If you want to play serious, you should get this instead of CSS.This game is worth the full price!4.5/5			"

												From my own point of view I find this game can be fun at times and addictive, however there are many factors that degrade the fun value of a game like this.Hackers and smurfs run rampant which ruins a lot of the playability. Sometimes it can however cause people to want to improve their own skills, but I find that a lot of the time people lose the will to play when they face either of these.One thing that bothers me most of all is the ranking system. The way it is now is based on wins more than anything, which doesnt exactly value your own skill level, since winning a match is more of a team effort than solo plays. If Valve were to change the ranking system to be based off of a persons individual skills, based on accuracy, kills, deaths, points, assists, etc. Then it would give you a better idea of that persons skill level, and putting that person with others of their skill level for a match would produce a lot better results than the current system. It would also discourage smurfs and hackers as well, since their stats would affect the ranks and the players they are put with.I cant recommend this game because of the lack of effort that is put into weeding out hackers and smurfs. The community run overwatch helps a great deal, but its not preventing the hacking in the first place, and it wont change the ranks people lose when faced against these kinds of people.Update: 05/08/2015A lot of the times the matchmaking system can make mistakes. But some things you just cant avoid. I find that a lot of people that play CSGO dont understand the fact that this is a team game. Today we played a competitive, the other team had at least one hacker, and our team had 2 people griefing. They were throwing the bomb away, flashbanging us on purpose, standing in our line of sight, just because they wanted to lose the match. They wanted to derank themselves. Which is another problem that comes with smurf accounts. Once they get a rank they need to lower it, so they lose games on purpose, bringing the whole team down with them.			"

												At this point my Counter Strike activity is largely masturbatory. I got close to giving a fuss, when I somehow got to Gold Nova II, but then the de-ranking update hit. Now, I'm more or less stuck bottom feeding with other silver 1 plebs for eternity. I assume this is for the best. I count 449 wins at present, and so my loss total is presumed to be 4-digits long. To be honest, I just load up comp dust2, and half-idle, half-run around with nosound, in window mode, whilst I watch Youtube. Sorry. This is wrong, and unfair to the other users, but I can usually round out the match in 2nd or 3rd place because I have decent aim in comparison to the others. (I'm surprised I don't get kicked more often.)I just can't feign the enthusiasm necessary to listen to foot steps, coordinate with others, or walk, or otherwise be tactful. I hit F3, to buy the ak or the m4, and just careen into the other team, hoping for 1-2 kills before I alt-tab out and wait for the new round to start (assuming I don't forget the game is running). Good luck and have fun though, I hear rushing B is popular. "

												Command and Strike: Global Alert is a game. This turn-based, roleplaying game combimes stealth and action not too distant to the Assassin's Creed series. Unlike the Assassin's Creed series, however, this game doesn't mess around. A risky lack of story really pays off with the powerful emphasis on coopertative puzzle solving. I'd caution new players to the Call of Strike: Global Warfare series, as the steep learning curve is somewhat of a disservice to the overall experience. However, if you can get over that curvature with ease, the experience opens up a lot of interesting rpg elements not typically seen in a third person shooter. If you're looking for a similar feel to the antiquated versions of this game but with more refined visuals, there's no reason to not pick this up.I give this real-time strategy visual novel a Snow White out of a Disney Princess.

												Counter-Strike. The game that lives up to its name. So simple, yet so much fun. It could be considered the game that began competitive first-person shooters... Or at least to my knowledge, it is.  And compared to the other Counter-Strike games, I gotta say... CS:GO was okay. Graphics are nice, old-school maps, and the new item drop system is a nice addition. But, now, the only reason I play it is because I'm playing it with a friend, or I just want a drop that I could sell, no matter how pathetic it would be, or I just wanna waste time. You would find it awesome at first. But, at some point, it didn't give me something CS 1.6 gave me, and still gives today - Thrill. I won't say it's bad. But, then again, your money's probably well-spent on this game on sale... Or well-spent on something else.			"

												If you are looking for a new game to play, this is a terrible choice!CS:GO has an horrible community, lots of cheaters, lots of smurfs, and a primitive hit detection.-Most part of the community in this game is rude and cruel.-There are lots of smurfs, which are basically players that buy new steam accounts with CS:GO just to play competitive gamemode against lower ranks. This will make you find players that play way better than you but they are on the same rank as you because they are using their smurf accounts.-The Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) doesn't seem to work because you can find cheaters almost in every single game.-The Hit Detection is pretty ridiculous. Sometimes you shoot to the enemy and it doesn't register, other times you shoot to the ground and you kill the enemy with an headshot. Some people call this recoil, but recoil moves your gun and not only the bullets like it happens in this game. When you spray in this game, if you aim to the ground, the bullets will go up but the gun will be aiming the ground like if the barrel was bent.I would sum up this game with the following keywords: Cheaters, Smurfs, Rude community, Bad Hit Detection.PS: I really like Counter-Strike, I play it since 1.6, but this is really sad because cheaters and smurfs are ruining the game!

It's time for me to write my review of this game's gameplay ONLY after playing it for almost 1000 HoursNote: I won't be writing about the skin , drop system. I will be only writing about the gameplay. I can't type perfect English so excuse me on that.Firstly, Counter Strike Global Offensive is a game which will require individual skill , teamwork and good communication. When , I started playing Counter Strike Global Offensive , I was a guy who always like to do things solo and not give a crap about my teammates. I would just not listen to my team and just do whatever I want. Once I started learning more about Counter Strike Global Offensive , I started to reliease that this game will require patience as you need time to get better at your individual skill and not to get angry at your team if they are not following to your calls.Secondly, Counter Strike Global Offensive has a handful of cheaters. Be physically and mentality prepared if you face a cheater on the enemy team. Don't start to rage as your mood will affect your gameplay , just play the game like there is no cheaters at all in that particular match.Thirdly, I will recommend this game to people who wants to get better at FPS games as this game will help you in your individual skill and teamwork. You will also make more friends and you end up playing every competitive match with them. I give this game a 8/10 rating. ""Why not 10/10?"" , you might be asking. There is many cheaters on the loose and they not have been banned , that is the reason why I don't give this game a 10/10.Finally , Good Luck and Have Fun if your planning to start playing this game. Hope this review has helped you if your planning to buy Counter Strike Global Offensive. If you have any questions , feel free to write down in the comment section and I will get back to you ASAP :)LengendaryEagleMaster Itz_£ęvį			"

Gameplay:This game much like, but also more so than the other Counter-Strike series is very competitive and even has its own game mode for such a style of gameplay. It's noticeably more competitive due to its live streams on Twitch and hosted events, this means that this games requires you to be more aware of your surroundings, being a better team player and good team leader. At times it requires to be a lone wolf and get new common self-awards such as a 'clutch' or an 'ace' AKA finishing off the opposing team as the last man standing. Compared to games like Call of Duty which I consider very fast paced, this game takes things slow and even with a 2 minute time limit you are required to take precautions before moving in.Graphics:Although I'm not bothered about graphics and doesn't really play a major factor in my decisions of getting games, these graphics have definitely improved from the previous Valve engine and still have that Counter-Strike feel. Some maps of course are imported from previous Counter-Strike games, and therefore have that similar but still fresh look, however the new maps have a definite sense of improvement and renewed style.Controls & Movement:The controls to this game are exactly the same to the other Counter-Strike series and therefore has it's playability output increased however, for those new to the game and have played previous game such as Call of Duty and Battlefield etc, getting used to this may prove difficult to some. The controls to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive are quite simple but getting used to the way the mechanics move may take a small amount of time. That's the good thing about Counter-Strike though, it's a reasonably easy game to get into but difficult to master, although with help from community workshop maps that help improve accuracy, you'll be able to have a small advantage.Conclusion:Overall this game is fantastic, bringing a classic FPS to a new generation of games. This games requires skill and isn't all about shooting first and thinking after, especially in competitive situations. Playing with friends is easily still really fun and has a user-friendly interface. Even though there's the addition of buying weapon skins etc, I find that's a bonus to the game if you're really committed. I think that, this is a game where you can endlessly rack countless hours up and be none the wiser.Rating:Gameplay: [9/10]Graphics:   [8/10]Controls & Movement:   [10/10]Overall:      [9/10]			"

You teammate goes round the corner, you hear him scream and he gets sprayed down, his body falls over, his eyes wide open, you're stunned and unable to move, his unemotional face staring blankly at you. Your team aren't talking to you, they must have gone. You have no choice but to push forward. Dreading walking around that corner, don't know how many people are behind it. You finally push round the corner and...♥♥♥♥ING AWPED, THIS GAME IS SO ♥♥♥♥!>Limp Bizkit has abandoned the match and received a 24 hour competitive matchmaking cooldown.			"

												Overall best team based FPS on the steam market. I am yet to find a game that is this fun, exciting, and with a better community! After hours of play its still like a new game and met some of the best people on it.  One of the most challenging and competitive FPS as well. It challenges your mind, as well as your aim. When playing competitive you can finally play against people that that share your skill, contrary to source and 1.6. This game plays as well as source and 1.6, if not better. CS:GO is the best game ever			"

												Don't buy this game if you are a casual gamer that does not enjoy spending money on virtual gun skins and boxes of pure misery.Well i do enjoy this kind of games, so i guess i've already blown off quite a bit of money on it already, and more is to be dropped into Gabe's wallet. If you play in Europe, there is a big chance that you will be queued up with russians. they tend to only speak russian to you, and nothing else which is kind of annoying.I do find the game itself quite entertaining and frustrating at the same time, but i do reccomend it if you are into 1st person shooters where the hackers are almost non-existant.i r8 8/8 [EDIT] Reaching legendary eagle you start to notice hackers every few matches..

												Best tactical fps game I know by far, because there is so much to learn and when your in game skill gets better, your rank gets higher. Negative: There are so many smurfs and hackers but thanks for the updates that valve has made, has lessen the amount of smurfs and hackers. I recommend this game for those who really do enjoy competitive fps games where your character doesn't get better, but the player itself gets better.			"
