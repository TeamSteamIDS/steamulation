												Even though this game is over 9 years old it still holds up as being one of, if not THE best zombie game on the market. It's not only fun playing single player but it's hilarious when you can get three more friends to join in the zombie killing.There's of course the standard Easy - Hard difficulities (Here being Easy, Medium, Advanced and Expert). So if you're looking for some mindless slaughtering to do you can put it on easy or if you and your friends is a tatical squad preparing for the zombie apacolypse this is a great way to start!Also you don't have to play the first game to get into this one, all the maps and more from the first game is in this one. Even if you want to play oldschool there is a mode for that. Speaking of modes, there's Versus mode which is exactly what it sounds like, you control both the infected and the survivors in rounds. The one who ends the final map with the most points win. There is also a realism version of this mode which means the survivers can't see the green/orange/red glow around them as they used to.There's also Survival which is aslo what it sounds like. Survive for X amount of time and you get bronze, silver or a gold medal depending on the requirments for the map you're playing.Scavanger is the last major gamemode, here you play as survivor and infected and the objective is to fill a generator with gas. Who wins depends on which team's the fastest.Then, finally, there's something called mutation. These are pretty much fun little mini modes. For example you have to try and survive an entire campaign on your own, you and all your teamates have katanas and can't get other weapons, you need to carry around a lawngnome to win etc.			"

												Dear Humans. This is Tank. You probably know me from hit game Left 4 Dead. Well, Tank need to get something off chest. It make Tank sad that as soon as you see him, you start shooting at him. Tank not mindless killing machine. Sure, Tank enjoy smashing human skulls to paste. What 12-foot tall, 800 pound, horribly mutated creature wouldn't? But there is another side to Tank. Tank also enjoy stamp collecting, scrapbooking, and updating blog under pen name ""Love Muffin"". Tank took origami class once at adult-learning annex, but fingers to big, so Tank smash teacher. Got B-minus. So, when you see Tank on the streets of city, instead of shooting, try asking Tank how day is going. You may find that you and Tank have more in common than you think. Of course, Tank will still smash you, but you will die having made new friend. And that make Tank happy.			"

												Yes, this game is good. It's worth buying. Yes, even after almost 7 years after the release people still play it even despite the fact it didn't really receive any new content. Why? Well, let me explain.Is it good because of graphics? Totally not. Even for early 2010's graphics weren't anything that impressive. It's still almost the same Source engine which powered Half-Life 2 and episodes. Yes, it was constantly updated but it didn't really progress. I mean we still have the same concept from early 90's: a game server hosts a map and up to 16 or 32 (or even 64 in some modifications) players can join and move around the map. You can reach certain points of the map and it will load another map. And that's all about it. But it's not open-world in any sense. It's something that reminds me of Doom and Quake games. In fact Source was partially based on Quake engine after all.But don't think graphics are bad. No, they are pretty enjoyable. I just don't recall technological advancement being a major selling point for this game. The game can impress you sometimes. Some textures look really dated. But overall it's just there. The game graphics won't make you scream in excitement, nor it will disappoint you even in 2016. A lot of stuff is destructible. I saw hours spent on zombie animations: infected puke, beat eachother, walk around, die spectacularly if killed. It's nice to see actual damage done to their zombies' bodies: some severe dismemberment and burning. But some may say graphics are kinda old. (Please don't think I'm one of these guys who only cares about polygons and realism, I'm just getting started.)So maybe the story is the main element here? Nope, you can complete the entire game without even learning anything about the characters or what's actually going on. You and 3 other people are given a selection of weaponry, medical supplies, some other stuff. You have a very simple goal: get to your destination or do something. Just get out of there alive.So why anything from 10 to 20 thousand people are playing this game right now? Why so many people played it for two or three thousand hours? Because of gameplay.Words cannot describe how many different situations there are. There are only 10 or so types of enemies, 3 basic types of main weapons, a few different secondary weapons, grenades and other items. And that's it. I know it may sound a lot at first but very quickly you acquire a taste for a favorite combination of weapons and items.Left 4 Dead series somehow manage to make people spend thousands of hours of their time playing the same set of maps. And it's a corridor shooter which means there is only one way to achieve your destination. How it's done then? Well, every time different items get generated in different places, you get zombies from different spawn points. You can play the same maps over and over, again and again. And people actually do.Speaking of people, it's a multiplayer. Yes, there is single-player mode where you can complete campaign with bots. But the most fun is playing with people. I find PvE aspect extremely interesting. Keep in mind your enjoyment really depends on people you play with. This game is about cooperation, you will never be able to complete it alone. So you have to find a server with good players, maybe you should play with friends, maybe you should make friends with people who play properly. Playing with bunch of griefers will suck. Playing with someone who actually wants to play is the best thing since sliced bread. Holy crap, you have to help eachother. Someone shares a medkit with you. His medkit. A medkit is being spent to restore your health you wasted because you made bunch of mistakes. But someone helps you for some reason. And you help them back, sharing resources with them. Oh, and keep in mind there is no reward system for helping others.There is PvP where you play as a bunch of zombies against a team of survivors controlled by other players. But I don't think it's as good as regular campaign. If someone thinks you are bad for the team, they just kick you out. Call me a weirdo, but I play it because of sense of fellowship or at least some basic positive human interaction. I don't really like the idea that someone may feel bad because I outsmarted them.I think I finally cracked Valve's logic. The main thing about a videogame is gameplay. This is exactly why we have these debates “%gamename% isn't a real videogame!!11” and other stuff. It's gameplay first. Yes, you need amazing visuals to make a masterpiece but it isn't the main thing you should focus on. I heard about Crysis as a game with great graphics many years ago, finally I decided to give it a try. I was utterly bored after a couple of hours — its gameplay was dull. Yes, you need story and great sound effects. But they still are only an excuse for gameplay.Left 4 Dead 2 doesn't fail to illustrate this concept. You can play it right away, you don't have to read wiki for 2 hours to craft a pickaxe or to build a basic rocket to orbit Kerbin. It takes minutes to learn basic concepts. “Easy to learn, difficult to master” — yes, we have it. But after a couple of hours I began to care about the story. You play as one of 4 characters, who are they? Turns out they are almost real people with some depth to them. Not too much, just enough to understand how they feel about each other. The whole story of zombie virus is told through surroundings. You see countless writings on the walls, a lot of documents are scattered around. The story told not using some boring and forced cutscenes but using details. You may skip story elements if you don't care about it. Or you may spend hours reading L4D wiki like I did.Valve remembers that this is a game. If you look through L4D concept art, you will see that survivors were supposed to look a lot more different. They wore a lot more utilitarian gear. In the final game they are wearing casual clothing which helps to establish who they were before the outbreak. I mean look at Rochelle's ear rings. I know what zombies would tear away first. It's unrealistic, and is it bad? Nope, it's fine, it's a videogame, not a reflection of reality.There is a lot of stuff in Left 4 Dead series which have never been done before. Developers added commentaries in game how they ended up creating everything, it's really interesting to check out. And I think I finally understand Valve's logic: they create games with some new elements. They create a game, it succeeds. Then they make a sequel which feels much better, they implement everything they need to make a great videogame experience. This is exactly what happened to Portal and Portal 2, Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2. This is exactly why Half-Life 3 may never happen: what exactly new can you say about first person shooter genre? It was told so many times, it's really hard to come up with something new. And this is exactly why they keep working on Left 4 Dead 3. At least it seems they are working on it. After all Left 4 Dead 2 appears to be incomplete to me. I feel like you can add more stuff in this concept.But right now it's totally worth spending money on Left 4 Dead 2. It's a very addictive game, and most importantly people are still playing it. If you get bored, there are tons of content in Steam Workshop you can b-a-s-t-a-r-d-ize the game with (if in you are in that kind of stuff).			"

												I can't stress enough about how this game, right here, is argueably the best game you could ever get in the Steam store. Everything from the gameplay, co-op, mechanics, narrative, game modes, visuals, weapons, characters and the modding community are equally all fantastic and highly remarkable. It's one of those essential games every PC gamer must have in their Steam library. It's a massive step-up to the first game in the franchise and it would take a lot of hardwork and determination to make a sequel that could ever hope to topple this one.I could write a much longer in-depth review about this brilliant game, but either you, the reader already acknowledge a lot about this game, through its strong magnitude and reputation. On the other hand, I personally would just want to leave it as the hidden gem, for the very small, minimal group of people who are still not familiar with this game, even to this day. With a message to those people, being simple and direct; you will not be disappointed by how much this game lives up to.I would advice the newcomers to this game to take it slowly and definitely look out for the -75% off sales or even better, the free offer of this game which is most frequently appearing on big Steam sales. I hope this short and simple review will come in handy and have a happy halloween!			"

												Energizing versus mode(s,) breath (and life)-taking COOP experience; a world of add-on maps available, easy to mod.  I'll let my six thousand hours speak for themselves!  This is just one of those games you can't beat unless a fantastic sequel is made for it.  Here's to hoping!  Nobody does it better than Valve.  You get your money's worth with their games.  This one is no exception.  Even if you purchase L4D2 on sale, or if it ends up part of some bundle, you're still coming out ahead.  I challenge any new player to this game, or skeptic for that matter, to play out the first full campaign (all maps,) and then re-evaluate if your're still uninterested/skeptical.   I'm confident you'll be happy you gave this game a chance;  some games are hyped and popular for a reason:  They're GREAT games! They could have taken my money, but all they got away with was my heart.   I paid 3 times more for games that I could never play a fraction as much as this.  I'll refrain from promoting a modded community I serve in, but let me say, to sum it up:   there is ""An L4D2 Experience"" for EVERYONE!  Buy it.			"

												The successor to Left 4 Dead, this second game adds new maps, new weapons, new special infected with new attacks and even new characters. But in many ways the most important different between the two games is the scoring system.Without mods, the first games scoring system really did tend to induce rage. A single mistake on a map and you could lose so many points that teams would be totally demoralized and either fall apart (making the game effectively over) or just quit (making it absolutely over). For hardcore players this was half the fun, but for the average casual player it could make Left 4 Dead a little too frustrating.Left 4 Dead 2 on the other hand had a far more forgiving score system allowing teams who fail badly on map 1 to still feel they have a good chance of clawing the in back in the next 3 or 4 maps. With party wipes being a little less likely due to the removal of the quad cap, Left 4 Dead 2 is still a game people can play causally and still enjoy. With the extra variety of a lot more special infected meaning a lot more variety in possible tactics, Left 4 Dead 2 is still one of the best team focused games that I have ever played.If you have a small group of close friends who love winning through superior team work rather than superior twitch skills, Left 4 Dead 2 is one of the best PvP games you could try. But be warned, playing with random people you have never met can be rewarding, but more often than not it can be bloody annoying.HOURS ON RECORD : I don't play this game on my public account. I have over 1500 my private account.			"

												L4D2 is a vast improvement in L4D in almost every respect. It actually has a plot for starters. Each chapter flows into the next as the four main characters try to escape hordes of the infected. That's right! They're not actually zombies folks! They're just humans infected by a virus that makes them exhibit zombie like personality traits, a plot line also been used a million times. But the plot is really not what matters here, it's not supposed to be important, as much as the plot as I got from the game without trying to find it was ""Here are some zombies, here is a gun, have fun."" What we're really here for is the gameplay.In addition to your weapons you can hold presents such as Molotov's or Pipe Bomb's, the latter of which is incredibly useful and incredibly awesome to behold. If you don't enjoy hundreds of zombies piling together then have their exploded body parts ragdoll through the air then something clearly went wrong when God was handing out the human brains and bird brains.Along with your dopey common infected are the more dangerous and lethal special infected who can ravage through a player's health in a matter of seconds as well as separate them from the group. These zombies must be brought down together and the players must constantly stay together to rescue each other from these zombies unless they want to lie down seductively on a dinner plate instead. The strongest of these are the Witch and the Tank, The Witch being able down a player in a single hit and The Tank having ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly insane amounts of health. All four players must stay together and work together to progress through the levels and do what is required of them depending on which chapter they are playing. The inclusion of these special infected zombies makes the game much more interesting and challenging than other zombies as well as bucketloads more fun.While playing through the same five campaigns may not seem like a good length for a game, this is made up by the other modes L4D2 brings along. There's the usual survival mode that almost every shooter has nowadays. Scavenger mode where you play the worst ♥♥♥♥ing part of the game over and over. And Versus mode where you get to play as one of special infected zombies in a team of four and try to stop the humans from reaching the safe house. This is one of the few games where I actually enjoyed the multiplayer, maybe it's because the game is focussed around it but that's beside the point. Versus mode kept me entertained for hours on end and even now I would go back and play it.The real reason that people can replay L4D2 over and over even though it's the same level is because of a bit of smart programming called the ""AI Director."" The AI Director has the ability to change the placement of walls, weapons, power ups and items in each level as well as being able to spawn hordes of zombies and special infected. This is done to an extent on one level on the fourth play through I was still discovering new paths through the level. No game has anything else like this and it is a unique bit of programming on Valve's behalf.BUT, remember that sentence about body parts flying through the air? Well that is in the game, but not in the Australian version. The Australian version of L4D2 has been cut down and censored to fit under the MA15+ label as we have no R18+ classification. Even Valve themselves were startled and confused by the refusal of the classification and I can understand why completely, the original game is not that bloody or violent that it would need to be banned. So say goodbye to corpses, body piles, gore, dismemberment and decapitation, apparently if we see that we will all turn cannibal and eat each other.Left 4 Dead 2 is a standout game that deserves the praise it gets. The gameplay is highly entertaining with good replay value due to the AI Director as well as beautifully atmospheric. The online multiplayer is actually quite good which coming from me is a massive ♥♥♥♥ing compliment so go out, buy this game, and witness it's mastery.			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 is my very first game on Steam. Left 4 Dead 2 is like first love. As they say, ""first love never dies"". No matter how many years have passed, this game will always be in your thoughts and you'll want to come back to this game. If you haven't played it much, you'll miss it. I've played this game for 2 years now and yet each and every experience I have on this game is unique and fun. This game should win the ""Test of Time"" award for being fun every playthrough. Timeless classic.			"

												I have been playing Left 4 Dead since the original came out on Xbox 360 in 2008. Once I got a PC that could run Left 4 Dead 2, I discovered that Left 4 Dead really has no end of enjoyment. It is not for everyone of course, but if you like slaying zombies, exploration, teamwork, fun with friends, and some hilarious moments, this game is excellent.It is now 2016, and still, people are making mods, addons, skins, new game modes, and creating unique servers that change the rules of the game. It is hard to get bored with a game that people keep adding to this much.You will unfortunately hear about, or experience yourself, bad players on this game. This goes for EVERY game out there on the Internet. If there is a way to ruin other players' fun, there are people who will try to do it. Please don't blame the game for bad players. Left 4 Dead 2 still has hundreds, maybe thousands of players who love to have a good time and try to support eachother in game. I'm one of those. =D If you have a bad experience, try again please. More good-natured players are always welcome.To me, this is the best game in the world right now. This is because it provides a fun way to meet cool and amazing people, who enjoy this great game where you are rewarded for working TOGETHER, instead of just killing eachother. The game itself provides lots of fun, but what really makes it amazing are the people you play with, and people who continue to make the game better.I have put off writing a review to this game for so long, because I really can't say enough about it. This review seems like it barely scratches the surface to me. All I can say is try it. TRY IT. Join some games, download some add ons and try those. Remember not to take it too seriously. Get killed, laugh, try to get better, die more, laugh even more. XD Left 4 Dead forever haha.			"

												This game alone is the main reason i bought a pc to start off with, with hundreds of hours on the xbox version of the game, i wanted to ""upgrade"" my left for dead experience, utilising the modding community and being able to finally play with my other friends on the pc and i honestly dont regret it, however there is one major drawback to the enjoyment of this game, the overwhelming amount of toxic players that are in the community. This can really ruin your game experience especially for unexperienced players as you will be kicked for almost any reason, half the time for no good reason at all. Examples could be:- Missed the insta kill spot? kicked! - Shot a teamate by accident because he ran infront of you? kicked!- haven't already played over 500 hours of the game? kicked!- your team leave you to die for no good reason? kicked!- can't speak russian? kicked!- use a health kit to save yourself on 3 health and not help your team mate who is on 43 health? kicked!- get slowed down by common infected when the team rushes? kicked!- do really well against the other team? the entire other team leaves, closing the server- take the melee weapon that a 9 year old on your team wanted? kicked!- use your mic and sound older than the 10 year olds in the game? get called a pedo and get kicked!- the vote kick on you doesnt get accepted by the rest of the team? vote kicker leaves the gamethis list could go on and on... oh and there is the guy that joins, kills the team, throws himself out of the window and then leaves i mean just **** those guys(would just like to mention these are the examples that have all happened to me in the past two weeks of playing)Despite this however the community does have some nice people in it, who just want to play the game and dont mind helping people or losing unfortunately these people arent extremely common so alot of the time your stuck with a toxic team that will kick you for just about any reason if your not perfect.Other than the toxic players however, the game really doesn't have much i can fault it on- There are 11 campaigns that are ready available without mods and campaigns aren't to long and remain pretty interesting throughout - a Fairly wide range of weapons with 14 guns, 11 melee weapons and three throwables. - There are eight characters, four for each left for dead game each of them as interesting, funny and well developed as the next - there are 9 different types of infected (including special common infected under just common infected) with 7 of them playable in the verses gamemode- the A.I director helps keep each level a little bit different, making replyability enjoyable- bringing along friends is a great idea as it supports 4 player co-op and 4v4 player matches (there are servers that raise this cap, immensely)- there are 70 available achievements that you can get along with 8 trading cards, each of which are available in foil version and there is 5 Emoticons and profile background also availableThe modding community for this game is absolutely amazing with mods for just about anything with different weapons, and character skis, HD textures and lighting, new campaigns and gamemodes, different infected skins and sounds there is  a mod for the amount of cockroches that spawn on the ground (i have this, its called Roach Rules) i would list more mods but that list would take to long to type. There is also a lot of anime mods and bikini mods for the character zoey so if your into that, you'll like the modding community even moreOverall, despite the bad sportsmanship of some players, it really is an enjoyable game, with lots of replayability and things you can do to the game to make it diffferent, bringing along friends can make the game even better and if you dont have any (i know the feeling) chances are you can find some when you play.Overall i'd give the game a 8/10			"

												As you can see from my hours played.  This is one of my favorite games of all time.  The real reason people have put so many hours into this game is because you are able to mod the crap out it and I joined a group of servers years ago and played ever since.  Not playing much now because not many people play this game anymore but was the best zombie game for it's time.			"

												Even though this game has a highly toxic community it still remains one of my favorite games of all times. The game started pretty tough for my three friends and me on normal difficulty (campaign mode) and we wondered how you could ever beat it on advanced or even expert? The level of helplessness and panic was just incredible. By now, after more than 1000 hours ingame, I know the game pretty good and I know that this game has for sure a nice learning curve. After some games the panic starts to turn into understanding and later on into a level of serenity, that turns this game into quite  another game.For me the toxicity is actually kind of fun in an online campaign game - I try to take it as a challenge. Am I able to win this campaign with such a team?With all the toxicity going on, the rare occasions of finding nice and skilled players online is pretty awesome.Once in a while you find this one game, where four random people just stomp the game into the ground: One for all and all for one - no one is left 4 dead!

												Left 4 Dead 2 is a first-person shooter game from Valve. It is a sequel to the previous game Left 4 Dead.Left 4 Dead 2 lets you play as another group of four survivors on a brand new campaign with a crossover campaign from the first game too. These new survivors are Rochelle, Coach, Ellis and Nick. This sequel has more game modes to play and even more choice of weapons to use against the undead, but there are also new types of special infected too, so be prepared to be amazed, or dead. It seems that Valve finally decided to add Left 4 Dead campaign into this new game, but the feels are different as the new infected also present in the old campaign along with the new weapons and improved graphics, making the game even more replayable.Left 4 Dead 2 also comes with Steam Workshop support so there are lots of user made custom content you can download to customize your game, like custom weapons, custom survivors, custom infected and special infected, custom maps and event some people made custom campaign with their own story. You can also make your own content and share it with public.Overall, Left 4 Dead 2 is a really good sequel. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 is a hard game to review. The left 4 dead games ""both of them"" are games that are unlike anything else I have ever played, they are games that quite literally changed my entire life. These games are the types of games that you can meet people on that will be friends for years to come and these games also have an unreal amount of replay value. you have campaign for the casual players with addon support so you have an almost endless amount of maps to play if you dont mind downloading more, you have versus which can be really fun, but sadly in both games unless you play with friends the community is either tryhards that care too much about winning or people that are so terrible that you wonder how they even got their computer running in the first place. Lastly there is survival, my personal favorite game mode. People in the survival community ""once you actually find the real survival players"" are useually a nice bunch of people and its a game mode unlike the other two in a good way once you give it a chance. Honestly both of these games although they both are titled ""Left 4 Dead"" are very different and many people i have run into tend to think of one game as simply better than the other, but objectively speaking this is simply not the case. Both games are too different to really make that kind of judgement. Both of these games are games that if you enjoy this type of gameplay, then you could waste thousands of hours on them.But this brings up the biggest problem with these games, the people in them. Do enough searching and you will find people you can mingle with but the majority of public players in either game regardless of game mode are unbelieveably dumb. In vs also not just the really dumb people but you have the typical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s found in any game based around pvp that seem to think that winning makes them more important somehow as a person and don't seem to realize that there is no reward for winning in a l4d games like there is in a competitive game like counter strike or dota with their tournaments. Campaign is a really casual game mode compared to the other two but still there tends to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in this game mode too sometimes, people that find joy in joining pub games just to grief their teammates for some reason and then leave without a word. Thankfully this is rare and most people in campaign are either mute or friendly.Then there is survival, a game mode that brings me more enjoyment but also more frustration than any other mode. In L4D2 it seems to be a collection of people that for some stupid reason refuse to play anything except for the mall map, people that are actually really terrible at it too and can run laps for 100+ min on mall sure but could not get a gold on any other map to save their life. There is l4d1 survival as well which is a dif style of play but the community is dying off because all of the players who have been around a long time have gotten tired of the game and pubs are beyond stupid. Always either people trying to glitch a time or people so bad/dumb you wonder if they were dropped on their head as a baby 5 times.All in all, You will enjoy the l4d games, both of them if you enjoy co-op based shooters, but you will have to endure a very mixed crowd of people regardless of game, with the first game haveing a somewhat more friendly crowd cause of the smaller community. I would recommend both games if you have the patience to search for people worth talking to or have someone to go into the game with.			"

TL;DRWith a rating of ""A+"", Left 4 Dead 2 is considered to be a classic FPS game, the second part of the series that teaches us how teamwork properly works in a world full of zombies.WARNING‼ It features neither Progression nor Ranking systems, thus matchmaking can be unfair.Basic info.Genre:Action (Shooter, Survival horror)Theme:Post-apocalyptic, Zombie-themedPlayer type:Single-player | MultiplayerPerspective:First-personSummaryFollowing the tracks of its precedessor, Left 4 Dead 2 takes place in the zombie-infested U.S.A., where a new traveling 4-membered group of Survivors fights for survival. Having in their disposal a vast arsenal of weaponry, the player faces the endless hordes of Infected, exploring several locations, completing objectives, and trying to find a way-out.Main analysis | Overall score: 89 ⁄ 100 | Rating: A+Technical work19 ⁄ 20Controls: ★ Honorable◼◼◼◼◼Valve's set of easy-to-learn, player-friendly controls is a typical element shared among its games, including Left 4 Dead 2 apparently.Mechanics: ★ Exemplary◼◼◼◼◼◼◼The mechanics are very simple, yet exciting. As a result of the availability of many different types of guns (including firearms, SMGs, shotguns, rifles etc), melee weapons (ranging from a katana to a chainsaw, and from a guitar to a freakin' frying pan), grenades and other equipment, the player can choose whether to shoot, cut, decapitate or burn the Infected.Gameplay modes: ★ Fantastic◼◼◼The map and mode variaton is remarkable, as there are both Single-player and Multi-player game modes that include Campaign, Survival, Versus, Realism, Scavenge, Mutations, and more.Functionality: Good◼◼◼◼◻Bugs are quite often phenomena in the Left 4 Dead 2 universe, yet the game runs smoothly in general.Story14 ⁄ 20Setting: Great◼◼◼◼◼Mostly set in fictional areas, suggestively located in the post-apocalyptic, zombie-infested U.S.A., Left 4 Dead 2 features a great variation of beautiful locations, including a hotel, a mall, an amusement park, a stadium, highways, swamps and isolated villages, a mansion, a sugarcane mill, a gas station, cities, and more.Characters: OK◼◼◼◼◻◻◻ Left 4 Dead 2 introduces a new cast of Survivors, including Nick, Rochelle, Coach, and Ellis, sticking to the series theme number, as well as the gender ratio of its predecessor. Unfortunately, apart from the adventurous stories that are hillariously narrated by Ellis, there is nothing else worth mentioning about the whole group, as the Survivors are overly restrained by their repetitive voice commands. Unlike Left 4 Dead which manages to balance this flaw by additionally realeasing an online comic[www.l4d.com], with intriguing new info about its characters, Left 4 Dead 2 fails to attract the audience's attention towards the new Survivors. Thus, they are bound to seem indifferently mysterious, if not completely impersonal and boring.Plot: Mediocre◼◼◻◻◻Along with its predecessor, Left 4 Dead 2 follows the same basic, trite concept: a small group of random Survivors who share no history fight for survival in a world world full of zombie-like beings, known as the Infected. A classic scenario ends up being completely vapid and unchallenging, as the linear levels and the simplified objectives both add up nothing of interest to the game's plot, and also restrict the player's contribution to just killing zombies, activating generators and other machinery and calling for help.Extras: ★ Sweet◼◼◼Left 4 Dead 2 has to offer the following free “DLC”: The Passing; The Sacrifice, with No Mercy; and Cold Stream, with the rest of the original Campaigns;which cumulatively result in making available most of Left 4 Dead's content.Artistic work19 ⁄ 20Graphics / Visuals: Great◼◼◼◼◼◼◻For sure, the graphic quality of Left 4 Dead 2 is beyond satisfying, as far as the standards of its year of realease are concerned. The areas, the characters, the objects, all of them seem detailed and realistic, while the bloodbath that follows the Survivors' encounters with the Infected is always full of gore.Cinematics: Good◼◼◼The introduction video is just epic.Soundtrack: ★ Epic◼◼◼◼It is well-known that Valve is used to providing its audience with high-quality game soundtracks, and of course Left 4 Dead 2 is no exception; on the contrary, music is a big part of the game's experience, as it stimulates the desired emotions by creating an atmosphere full of suspense and agony. Notably, each Campaign is accompanied by its very own theme soundtrack, which is basically an adapted (to-the-style-of-each-Campaign) version of the original soundtrack. Also, Midnight Riders are here! A single exclamatory mark cannot compress the awesomeness of this hard rock band, created by Valve for the purposes of the series; a famous group that is widely-advertised in the whole game, and whose songs are playable in the in-game jukeboxes; they even have their own albums, concerts, merchandise, and website[www.midnight-riders.com].Audio: Good◼◼◼Going on, when it comes to in-game audio and sound effects Valve proves to be, once again, an expert creator, capable of stimulating the player's hearing, enhancing the whole experience acoustically.Voice acting: Good◼◼◼Keeping in mind the very few human characters encountered in the game, one can mainly focus on the 4 main Survivors, whose voice acting is professionally good.Fun fact: Chad L. Coleman, Coach's voice actor, played as Tyreese in AMC's The Walking Dead.Misc.18 ⁄ 20Evolution◼◼◼◻Community: Nice◼◼Difficulty: Adjustable | Relatively challenging◼◼◼◼Duration: Very long◼◼◼◼Replayability: ★ Incredible◼◼◼◼File size: Relatively big◼◻Personal experience (fun, emotions etc)19 ⁄ 20▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁Version 2.1.1 .

												Ruined my gaming life and at the same time it really enhanced it. I met most people on my friends list on it and became really good friends with some of them.I'm mostly a Scavenge and Survival player. Yeah, I don't really like Versus and Campaign, which are the most played game modes. Being a Scavenge player, where the community is way smaller, I get to know basically everyone who plays it regularly and when I join a game (mostly on the Rooftop map) it's guaranteed that I will meet someone there who is either on my friends list or that I knew before just by playing. I'd say the best years to play this game mode where 2010-2013, it just died from there on to nowadays, but surprisingly, there's people who still play Scavenge, so there's always at least 1 game.Left 4 Dead 2's main problem, unlike most FPS games, isn't hackers. It's the community itself, specially the tryhards. Those morons that take video gaming more seriously than real life (well, they probably don't have a proper life to begin with anyway). Yeah, they get mad in public matches if people don't have over 2.000 hours and don't skeet every Hunter they see, even if their team is winning. You're going to have a hard time playing the PvP gamemodes, Scavenge and Versus, if you don't have at least 200 or 300 hours on Campaign and Survival you're going to be judged (if your profile isn't set to private or friends-only).Don't expect a horror shooting game, there's no horror elements in Left 4 Dead 2. The creepiest thing (if you can call it that) is the Witch, and even so, she's kinda... cute. Expect an action game with a toxic PvP community and a (mostly) friendly PvE one.			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 is a very fun adventure game in which you team up with 3 others and kill countless zombies as you fight for your survival. Utilise many weapons such as assault rifles, pistols, axes and even chainsaws. It has a good storyline as well, making the characters who need to survive quite interesting as they have to interact with eachother. While the zombie-killing is fun, after a while it will get reptitive and you'll run out of fun ways to kill zombies. Another downside is that you should really play it with others, as with bots it is really bad because they act like they have no brain. There are a good range of modes however, even ones when you get to control zombies!Pros:+Good variety of weapons and fun ways to kill zombies+Good story+Fun with 4 people+Good modesCons:-Can get repetitive, depending on how you view it-Bad if you're on your ownVerdict:9.1/10.0			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 is a sequel to the original Left 4 Dead, a zombie shooter set in a variety of locations. Each campaign has 4 survivors, who have to reach the safety vehicle or area on the other side and have to fight their way through tons of infected. There's also versus and a lot of other game modes.PROS: + Teamplay can make a real difference. Good communication and teamwork seem to be more important than skill+ Good replay value: the director spawns infected, objects, weapons and items randomly each time, making playing the same maps over and over less repetitive+ A balanced amount of weapons that satisfy in both audio and visuals+ A good variety of game modes, difficulties and alternate playstyles that can deliver a challenge or a different type of experience. Has expert realism gotten too easy? There's a bunch of mutations that step up the difficulty by a whole + This is a game that's very user-friendly in supporting the use and management of add-ons in a simple and clear-cut way instead of having to learn about managing files, extensions and whatnot. You can download, use and delete mods all without leaving the game and you rarely have to open any files on your desktop+ The Source engine and console make adjusting the settings to your likings easier and is a comfortable engine to play with+ Trading cardsCONS - L4D(2) is infamous for its toxic community, especially in VS. This is mainly because of how suitable this game is for trolls (friendly fire, suicides, etc.). Joining or starting public games has a fairly present chance of inexperienced, arrogant or annoying players, psychos, grievers or trolls joining and ruining the game. A lot of people are playing on difficulties that they cannot handle, sometimes solely for the sake of causing unrest. To gauge an idea of what this is like: our former server's banlist had accumulated over 350 banned players in under a year - The maps can get repetitive after a while, despite the director randomizing entities - (Rare) crashes, glitches and disruptions in both sound and visual. This is partially related to add-on collisionIf you plan on playing L4D2, I highly recommend you friend some nice players, play with friends or play on a moderated server (admins that kick troublemakers), because at some hours, playing this game on the highest difficulty is near impossible due to the type of players mentioned above. Nevertheless, L4D2 is a great game that can be tons of fun and you'll likely keep coming back at it for many hours. Definitely a recommendation for players who enjoy teamplay.My rating: 9* About ""Product received for free"": I got this game for free during Christmas 2013, which makes me a Ghost of Christmas Present player.

IntroLeft 4 Dead, a series I simply cannot get enough of.As I wrote my ""extremely late"" review for Left 4 Dead 1, I figured I might as well do one regarding Left 4 Dead 2, in the same style. :)The GameDeveloped by Turtle Rock Studios and Valve itself, Left 4 Dead 2 is the sequel to Left 4 Dead.Bigger, better, more succesful (based on numbers, not my own opinion) than before!If you've read my Left 4 Dead review, most of these will be the same as it's basically the same game. ;DPros● Unique Cooperative Gameplay in every Gamemode! (Campaign, Versus, Survival, Scavenge)● The Lobby/Drop-in system works flawlessy allowing players to effortlessly finding a game.● Free DLC.● A New Gamemode! Scavenge!● Mutation System, play or create your own gamemodes!● Workshop!● Make your own Maps!● Low PC Specs required.● Get to play as Special Infected! (Yeah.. those Zombies..!) in Versus mode.● A bigger variety in Special Infected compared to Left 4 Dead● Very Easy to setup your own Dedicated Server.Cons● Players have to download Maps manually, they are unable to download from the Server they are joining, same goes for Custom Made mutations.● The Game is unpolished in regards to exploits and bugs, Valve has never responded to countless reports and complaints.● No Matchmaking, you're very likely to end up with very unbalanced teams when joining Versus games.● A weak Attempt at ""Clan/team Matches"" by introducing ""Team Versus"", ""Team Scavenge"" modes.● Ragequitting is not punished at all.The CommunityThe Community for Left 4 Dead 2 is very comparable to Left 4 Dead, in Public Games you can expect to be insulted and possibly even votekicked if you're underperforming in the eyes of your teammates. However, in Co-op gameplay this is a much less frequent occurence.There however is still a breathing Competitive Scene, this scene is much better in terms of actually being able to finish your games as well as making buddies and playing on much more balanced and difficult ""Gamemodes"".I'd advertise if I knew for sure it was allowed. :DCurrent Status of the GameAs of this post, Left 4 Dead 2 has an 30-Day Average of 9033 Players Worldwide.The game is definitely alive and has games to join all the time in my area. (West-Europe)Left 4 Dead 2 Costs $20 which is the same price as for its predecessor, Left 4 Dead.Final WordsLeft 4 Dead 2, in its current state is well worth the full $20, even if you're going for just a little bit of Campaign and Survival. The more friends you have to play this with, the more fun you'll have.● 5 Original L4D2 Campaigns.● 6 L4D1 Maps DLC. ● 1 The Passing DLC.● 1 Cold Stream DLC.			"

												Over 2000 hours and I still haven't reviewed this game! well here goes...Do you like zombies? Do you like guns? Do you like Mariocart? Do you like to spam right-click like your middle finger has Parkinsons? Well you are going to love this!L4D2 is a unique, fast paced twitch shooter with loads of replayability. Even if you get bored of the official valve content there are tons of fun community maps to try out. In particular I recommend Questionable Ethics and The Bloody Moors. Despite the zombie theme L4D2 is not really a horror game and the L4D2 campaign and characters in particular are pretty cartoonish compared to the darker design of the original Left 4 Dead. However, all of the L4D1 maps were ported over to L4D2 a long time ago now, so there isn't much need to buy the original unless you are really curious or nostalgic about it.The game is getting a bit old now with alot less people online than there used to be. Consequently mosty of the players you find online are either veterans/long term addicts of the game or newbies from the previous sale. This only really applies to the PvP modes of the game (Versus and Scavenge) but new players are going to have a tough time in public games because of this. L4D2 does not have a very high skill ceiling like Counter Strike or Quake but there is still a fairly steep learning curve to start with. In any random public game you are likely to be playing with players who have 1000+ hours who know the maps like the back of their hand and know all the various little tricks and strats. You will find them frustrating to play against and they will find it frustrating having you on their team. This is the kind of game where one player can really drag a whole team down so if you are that player you can expect to be kicked alot. If you are new you should start out playing versus with friends, or get onto some 10v10 commuinity servers where you can mess around without getting kicked from the game.People say that the public versus community is really terrible but I dont think it is any worse than other PvP games apart from the fact that some of the game mechanics specific to L4D2 make people rage such as the forced dependence on teammates and some of the inherent randomness of the game. In fact I would say that the versus community is better now that it was 4 years ago when the game was more popular. For example most of the time now people will 'ready up' before starting a round, whereas before it was normal to see people deliberately rushing out of spawn while players are still loading in. But yeah... if you are new you are going to need thick skin in public versus.Versus is definately the most replayable mode, and the reason why many people keep playing this game for thousands of hours, but it what I said above puts you off you can always stick to playing the co-operative modes which are slower paced and with more easygoing players. The exception to this is expert difficulty, where friendly fire damage is signifigant and effects playstyle alot. Because of friendly fire expert is also the biggest target for griefers. Playing alot of expert co-op will make you paranoid about teamkillers and you will start to accumulate a nice big blocklist.Anyway what I have written might come across as negative but I think it is honest view based on over 2000 hours of gameplay which by itself says alot about addictive and replayable this game is. I don't think I have ever played any other game for as many hours, and no other game has made me laugh or rage as much as L4D2.			"

It can get somewhat intense or difficult but with a good team you can definitely progress in the game and the mechanics are straight forward.			"

												After looking through my most played games list I realised I owed it to the Left 4 Dead games to leave my positive review, even if it'll be lost in a sea of the other 150,000+ positive reviews. Left 4 Dead is built on a couple of basic but important principles: It's immediately playable even to new players, it's movie-esque and the sound, vision and events are important for suspense and tension during gameplay and it's absolutely hands-down a game that excels at cooperative dynamics and benefits from friendly banter.All these things combined mean that 8 years after release it's just as fun, and despite the fairly frustrating online playerbase and mindset, and some failings towards long-term play, it's still absolutely a game that you can dive right into at any time and have some good old fashioned fun.

It's not a bad game, it's just that every person you find on a server expects you to be 110% perfect that the game. If you don't do exactly your team mates tell you to do they will just kick you. If you don't kill someone with that death charge, they kick you. If you go decide to help a bot while you team leaves you behind, they kick you. If someone just feel like being a♥♥♥♥♥♥ they kick you. If everyone like that guy who is going to kick you, they kick you. If you to play the game casualy, they kick you. If you did something you didn't know was wrong, they kick you. I you don't have enough hours, they kick you. If you die, they kick you. They kick you they kick you and they kick you. Thats all this game is is just joining servers and being kicked. Every other server I play on I get kick for just playing the game. It's not some online ranked game. It's a Multiplayer survival game meant for you to have fun, no to get kicked by perfectionist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who expect everyone to be good a game. I get if have a troll in your lobby, or a person keeps going afk, or they have a ping of 999, or if they are mic spamming, because thoes are reason to kick people.

												Has a very toxic community but it's very fun to play.I used to play this game back in 2009 on console when I was VERY young. Like 8 years old young. I also played the first Left 4 Dead game on console. (I used to be a console peasant T^T) and I moved onto PC in 2013.Lets talk about the community. It's very toxic. Whenever I join an Expert campaign, there's a griefer that's filling their teammates up with lead and doing all sorts of♥♥♥♥♥♥to make you have a bad experience. There are people who despise new players and they refuse to teach them all about The Left 4 Dead series. There are people who just randomly kicks people even though they haven't done jack♥♥♥♥♥♥ I won't even go into detail about Versus mode.The game is pretty good. I prefer Left 4 Dead over Left 4 Dead 2 but this game is awesome. Unlike the first game, there's a Steam Workshop for it. You can reskin those ugly models. You can make your Left 4 Dead 2 scarier, or you could make it very humorous. Perhaps, make it a weeaboo's dream or make Team Fortress 2 characters fight hordes of Teletubbies with a Shrek tank running around while the TF2 characters shoot guns that go, ""PINGAS!""The game is very fun to play but recommend to play with friends. It's more fun to play with them.			"

Votekicked.Decimated the other team as the tank in versus? Votekicked.Healed yourself when you were recently downed but didn't heal a kid who had 43hp and pain pills? Votekicked.Too good? Votekicked.Too new? Votekicked.Startled the witch but cr0wned her? Votekicked anyway.If you're looking for a good lobby, it's not common.I suggest before buying this game you have friends to play with, Solo is a dead end, Bots aren't fun.If you can find somebody with low hours and they're nice people, here's what you should do.Friend said new individual, and play friends only games with them, Repeat this short process until you've got a good group of 4.If you DO have friends to play with, Ignore this whole group building thing.From MY Experience with good friends and cutting out the short session i had with multiplayer and votekicking.I'd have to give this a solid 10/10.

												This is a really nice game - together or alone. Because even if you're just one player, there will be 3 mates with you, who are necessary because those badass zombies are in great MAJORITY. There are a lot of different types of zombies, some of them can only be defeated with teamwork. Some of the Levels are designed slightly creepy and all of them are having a different type of theme. A roller coaster, or the swamp, a storm at night? Everything's possible. But what's worth to buy this game, when you can't kill those guys? Well - you can! And to do so you can find a bunch of different weapons all over the maps. An Axe, Machete, Katana, and - of course - guns. A lot of guns. The story isn't anything really new, but for zombie-games there isn't much space to experiment with that. But it's not bad in any way.Final words: This game is much fun to play with friends, or all alone with the help of the your fellows. With a lot of different modes you can spend a lot of time in this great game and it's definitely worth it.			"

												A lot can be said about this game, but there's something specific I want to say about this game after seeing the popularity of recent multiplayer games like Evolve and Payday 2.Left 4 Dead 2 is a great example of replayability done right. It doesn't try to keep you playing with progression, but with sheer FUN. While a lot of online games these days will beat you over the head with an experience bar and taunt you with unlockables, Left 4 Dead 2 doesn't keep anything from you, and from the word go, you have access to whatever equipment you find randomly strewn across its maps. It focuses on making any given campaign run or round of versus unique and interesting, and you as a player get to enjoy the journey instead of simply anticipating the destination. This isn't a game where you grab the SMG because you want some kind of SMG bonus afterward, or you sneak past a sobbing zombie woman so you can get an experience bonus the next time you play. This is a game where you grab a shotgun because you want to shoot that Witch in her stupid, crying face.			"

												TL:DR - Get it when it is on sale, only thing that keeps this going is what the community pumps out in the workshop. Not much I can say about this which many others have not.+ Plenty of modes+ Workshop+ Custom campaigns- Horrible community- Screaming kids- Admin abusers (not official admins)- VS is a kick simulator- Newbies that don't know what team-work isStill holds up to this day, I really like this game and glad I got it. Gotten some nice hours out of it though most of it is on multiplayer. On singleplayer it is bland. The bots tend to not help you or get stuck but are a good starting point but multiplayer is where you learn what is the best and worst thing to do per map.VS is still toxic as ♥♥♥♥, take a friend with you to be on your side otherwise you should expect kicks every 10 seconds because someone on your side is not happy with the way you play.Also expect some noobs to waste all your kits and still expect you to heal them with yours when they been incapped or my god they gone below 70HP and refuse to use pills. I just leave these wasters to die because they are not helpful, they do not listen and will most likely take your safe-room kit as well as any other kit they bloody find. Even if you do protect the they will use their kit first instead of pills and then need another kit later on which is not there.So both experts and newbies are toxic on this, experts because in VS they want you to do everything 100% their way without even telling you while SOME newbies refuse to listen and think only they are important enough to be healed, you are just there to carry their♥♥♥♥♥♥to the saferoom and die. They don't even try to save you.Oh and prepare for children to scream down their mics, play annoying music through it or refuse to mute their mic so you can hear their parents argueing in the background because gosh they think they need to broadcast it.Only thing that keeps me playing is the workshop, so many mods to customise your characters but also some pretty good campaigns, some original, some based off other games such as Resident Evil. They keep it fresh when bored of the official campaigns which can over-stay their welcome too easily or at least they do to me.			"

												I couldnt decide what to write in this review , so im gonna share with you guys my favorite apple pie recipe Enjoy! :Pastry2  cups  all-purpose flour 1  teaspoon salt 2/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons shortening 4 to 6 tablespoons cold water Filling1/3   to 1/2 cup sugar 1/4 cup  all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/8  teaspoon salt 8 cups thinly sliced peeled tart apples (8 medium) 2  tablespoons butter or margarine 1) In medium bowl, mix 2 cups flour and 1 teaspoon salt. Cut in shortening, using pastry blender (or pulling 2 table knives through ingredients in opposite directions), until particles are size of small peas. Sprinkle with cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and pastry almost cleans side of bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons more water can be added if necessary).2) Gather pastry into a ball. Divide in half; shape into 2 flattened rounds on lightly floured surface. Wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate about 45 minutes or until dough is firm and cold, yet pliable. This allows the shortening to become slightly firm, which helps make the baked pastry more flaky. If refrigerated longer, let pastry soften slightly before rolling.3) Heat oven to 425°F. With floured rolling pin, roll one pastry round into round 2 inches larger than upside-down 9-inch glass pie plate. Fold pastry into fourths; place in pie plate. Unfold and ease into plate, pressing firmly against bottom and side.4) In large bowl, mix sugar, 1/4 cup flour, the cinnamon, nutmeg and 1/8 teaspoon salt. Stir in apples until well mixed. Spoon into pastry-lined pie plate. Cut butter into small pieces; sprinkle over filling. Trim overhanging edge of pastry 1/2 inch from rim of plate.5)  Roll other round of pastry into 10-inch round. Fold into fourths and cut slits so steam can escape. Unfold top pastry over filling; trim overhanging edge 1 inch from rim of plate. Fold and roll top edge under lower edge, pressing on rim to seal; flute as desired. Cover edge with 2- to 3-inch strip of foil to prevent excessive browning.6)  Bake 40 to 50 minutes or until crust is brown and juice begins to bubble through slits in crust, removing foil for last 15 minutes of baking. Serve warm if desired.			"

												Played it, loved it. So yes, where do I begin? This is probably the most teamwork-oriented game I'll ever play. Not even Team Fortress 2 can compare to the importance of teamwork in a game like this. I can't stress enough that spelunking alone will get you killed. Gameplay in general? It's alright. I'm no professional critic, but I can say it's simple enough to understand. Shoot zombies, get inside safehouses, try not to die.Oh and I love the voice talents. So many lines for performing a single action, like apologizing, getting saved, and even looking at safehouse graffiti.Good game. "

												The fellow survivors and I hid in in the local burger joint. We were stuck in the middle of a thunderstorm so we had to  turn on the huge neon sign above it to call a boat for rescue.We survive the whole thing perfectly well, until the boat finally arrives and we find a huge beast of a thing, called a Tank, standing in our way. At that moment, we all knew it was everyone for themselves.The first dude runs for it, but gets pounced by a hunter.The girl runs for it and makes it.The third dude is about to run, but I shoot him in the face several times, not incapping him, but making him slow enough for the Tank to catch him. I use this time to escape.33/11 would kill teammate for boat again.			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 is a wonderful game for what it has. It is a well made First person shooter by valve, who shows that they have the prowess to know what they are doing. Left 4 Dead 2 is capable of being played alone with bots, but the real charm lies with online play. While the general stance on pub quality is relatively neutral, it is great if you can ask some friends to join the harvests. Coop is the prominant gamemode, but mutations and versus are still fun gamemodes. Left 4 Dead 2 is also interesting to dig into for some lore, but that is an attribute more to Valve than to the game at hand. Overall, Left 4 Dead 2 is a great game for its price which can go on sale on the major sale events. It's features are great and you can emulate the original coop and versus matches through official mutations, so other than achievements, you're not missing much if you're tight on money. All of this is without mentioning the prominant moddng community who works hard at providing reskin mods and maps through the workshop. I highly reccomend this to anyone who wants a standard First person shooter and has a few friends willing to join the chaos.			"

												Just as with the original Left 4 Dead, Left 4 Dead 2 is a first-person shooter which pits players against hordes of zombie-like enemies. It is set during the aftermath of an apocalyptic pandemic and focuses on four survivors who have to take on the infected specimens. These survivors must fight their way through levels, cooperate with one another, so that they can reach safe rooms that act as checkpoints, with the goal of reaching a rescue vehicle at the campaign's finale. Whereas the first game had a limited selection of weaponry, this sequel gives you multiple shotguns, multiple handguns, and multiple fully-automatic weapons, melee weapons as well as incendiary ammunition, explosive ammo and laser sights. You'll be putting these weapons to the test against common, uncommon and special infected (which  have higher intelligence, are more aggresive and more likely to attack, rather than passively sitting until disturbed). Four of these special Infected (the Hunter, Smoker, Charger and Jockey) are 'pinners' and require another Surviour to knock them off. The other ones (Spitter and Boomer) support the pinning infected, mainly because their attacks can help slow down the Survivors. The last two specials (Tank and Witch) are considered ""Boss infected"" as they have a very high amount of health, they spawn at the rarest rates and they can easily kill a Survivor in a matter of seconds. Like before, there are multiple difficulties such as an easy and normal one, serving as a good entry-level challenge for new players, advanced difficulty for more experienced players and and an expert one where you have to be extremely cautious when moving forward since witches can instantly kill you when starting them, health kits are extremely rare to find outside the saferoom and friendly fire inflicts half damage to the Survivors.There are thirteen playable official campaigns that take the survivors through a wide variety of detailed environments - from swamplands to a creepy carnival ground, from flooded suburbs to claustrophobic city streets. There are also several multiplayer mods such as:1.   Survival mode   - (A 4 player co-operative mode where survivors try outlast a never ending horde); 2.   Realism mode    - (With some changes to game mechanics, the hardest one off all) 3.   Realism versus mode  4.   Versus mode   - (Two separate teams of 4 players take turns playing as Survivors and Special infected, competing for the most points). 5.   Scavenger mode   - (Another 4v4 versus mode where survivors attempt to fill a generator with gas cans, scattered throughout a map while the infected team must work together to stop or delay the survivors from filling the generator).Overall, Left 4 Dead 2 was very much worth the purchase. The thing I like the most about this game is that it does promote teamwork (more than most of the games on the market). Players have to work together, healing, helping and protecting one another in order to survive.			"

												If I said L4D2 isn't a good game, I would be lying. Besides, what is my review compared to the fact that it has been one of the top-rated games of its era?Remember those horror movies involving zombies where the main characters run and hide when chased? Left 4 Dead 2 is nothing like that.In Left 4 Dead 2, when you see zombies, you run towards them.You shoot them, you cut them, you slice them, you dice them, you saw them apart, you burn them. Basically do anything to kick their undead asses so hard they'd wish they stayed in hell.And then they send the big guns against you. The special kinds that have special abilities to horrify you.And then you rinse and repeat. You blow them to smithereens, you smack them to kingdom come, you tenderize them.And when you can stand there in a group of 4, and the dead actually fears you, you'll know this is a game that screams:""Come at me, and we'll see who's the dead one.""

												Let me start with this: I love the L4D series; both games. The gameplay and various stories really tops it off.That's the sad part.Unless you decide that you want to play solo or maybe with some friends, don't bother with this game. It's really nice, and I mean REALLY nice to play offline, but any attempt to play online will be immediately refuted by the majority of players who happen to be super pro elitist ***holes. You will get kicked for everything, and I mean EVERYTHING. I've been kicked for opening a door, healing a partner, accidentally incapacitating a partner who was at 1 health and in the middle of the crossfire, using a med kit because I'm low on health, being pinned by a zombie, AND MY FAVORITE, being a f***king new guy. You CANNOT play multiplayer as a new guy because the elitists forget that you have to practice to get good. Seriously. The Community is by far the worst in current gaming history. Avoid them if at all possible.			"

												It's zombies vs humans so brace yourself! And what makes this game a one of a kind? Besides there are several titles in the same genre with similar elements. Let me first point out the 'good' in the game. Valve indeed outdid themselves with a variety of special infected each with unique ability and style. The common infected rush in hordes and are super fast on feet. It's thrilling!All maps, single or multiplayer are campaign styled which means they are huge and you navigate across them. Like an added bonus, nothing is as exciting as a speed run and dodge through hordes of infected. What's more fascinating is the community mods and servers that offer custom gameplay experiences. The first person shooter is simple to grasp with absence of any hud clutter. Player interaction with health and healing makes it a fabulous team work experience and sometimes demanding as in the realism mode.Now let me point out the 'bad'. It's valve engine and thus is never bug free no matter how many patches they release. While a good teamwork makes the gameplay exciting, some community servers offer cancerous and salty players that just restort to team killing and notoriety. Reputed servers are known for weeding out such players and keep a balanced gameplay.Nevertheless, the first thing you do is jump straight into one of many community servers for coop campaign and play wisely. You wanna avoid accidental team killing and straying far away from the team while providing support as much as possible. Sure, you may also wanna start farming for points whilst your mates are left for dead and still complete the campaign like a pro. You either die a hero or live long enough to be the villain!Rated 8.5/10			"

												Just look at my playtime.Pros:- 8 survivors with distinct personalities and tons of lines- Neat soundtrack mixing an orchestra with traditional Southern instruments- 13 campaigns made of 2-5 maps each, each lasting around 30-60 minutes depending on your skill and play style. They're so detailed that after playing countless times, I'm still noticing new things. They include a hotel, city streets, sewers, a carnival, rock concert, forest, a mall, church, sugar mill, flooded streets... quite a variety there.- The ""director"" AI system changes things based how you play; Whether to spawn helpful items, or ease up on the zombies spawning, stuff like that. This, combined with branching paths, makes each playthrough of a campaign somewhat different.- Includes all of the original Left 4 Dead characters and campaigns.- A modest arsenal of guns, melee weapons, grenades and some special things including a chainsaw, grenade launcher and street-sweeping M60- An infinite supply of common zombies to shoot, bash, cut, burn, explode and dismember in many ways. Alone, they're mere cannon fodder, but they work together to slow or overwhelm the survivors.- Encourages working together. Wander off and you're bound to get killed.- 8 special zombies which pose unique threats. Every strategy the survivors use can be countered by a certain special.- Co-op for 4 players online or 2 player split-screen. (Some modded servers even support 8 survivors.)- Versus mode allows you to play as a special zombie, and work together to take down the survivors. Other modes include scavenge, sort of capture-the-flag with gas cans; and survival, where you hold off against the infected as long as possible. Also has lots of ""mutations"" which modify gameplay in different ways.- Still updated with bug fixes and additional modding support. Some long-term amusing bugs remain, but nothing which negatively affects gameplay.- Jaw-dropping amount of mods, and most importantly: campaigns! It would take me weeks to play through them all.Cons:- The AI is... not great. When you're playing against survivor bots, they can feel cheap. But when they're on your side, there are times when they'll just stand by and watch you die from a foot away. Playing with friends highly recommended.If you have 3 friends and love shooting zombies, you can't go wrong with L4D2.			"

												A lot of sequels try to reinvent the original game and fail miserably in the process. L4D2 doesn't have that ambition. It just took what made L4D great and designed new campaigns, new levels, new weapons. It actually almost feels like an expansion pack for the original game. Which is great if you ask me :-). If it isn't broken, don't fix it! If it's fun, don't change it.That being said, I didn't feel the characters to be as likeable as the original foursome. The level design is slightly underwhelming compared to the original game. But the new weapons and enemies definitely make up for it. "

												I absolutely love this game and is one of my favorite games of all time, so I'm giving this a positive review. That being said, I'll have to address the matter of this game that completely destroys it. A simple word, 'Community'. Out of all of the communities of games, movies, etc, this is the worst one I have ever came across. This community is full of elitists, ridden with them. They always kick you for doing the slightest thing wrong or not doing what they want you to do. For example; About to die and stops to heal = kick.Killing a zombie that someone else was about to kill = kick.Just missing a player as a charger = kick.Walks out of spawn and immediately gets pounced = kick. So why do I recommend this game you ask? It's because of the game itself. I only play this game with friends (for obvious reasons) and that is a highly fun experience. If you are planning on going on a pub server, bring around two other people with you, therefore you have less chances of getting kicked.			"

												I explained the majority of how Left 4 Dead as a series works in my Left 4 Dead 1 review here so for this review I'm mainly going to be talking about the new features of Left 4 Dead 2.The new campaign maps look absolutely wonderful and they're brimming with great atmosphere and are very screenshot worthy and the graphical designs on guns have improved making it more enjoyable to wield them. Melee weapons have been introduced and it's a nice change to switch to a melee weapon instead of always using firearms although it probably isn't going to prove very useful if you're playing a difficult difficulty unless you run out of ammo on your primary weapon. However the chainsaw is extremely helpful for tearing through waves of zombies and it's probably one of the most fun things you can do in the game. L4D2 introduced new special infected including the spitter, the charger and the jockey. The spitter was a great addition and is an interesting and fun asset to the game, the charger is decent and it's fun trying to avoid its charging attacks but I felt as if the jockey wasn't really necessary and the game might have done better without it. The scavenger hunt didn't account for many hours of playtime since I found it rather dull. A team tries to collect as many gas canisters as possible and attempts to return them to their base to fuel up a generator while the special infected team tries to prevent them from fueling the generator. The mode was an interesting concept and fun for a while but got stale quickly and would have preferred to play something else, retreiving gas cans and getting attacked by a special infected eventually becomes tedious and annoying. But all in all I recommend this game to Left 4 Dead fans and first-person shooter fans alike. :) Probably should have talked more about the characters but the characters don't add much to the game in my opinion, it's not like it's story based.

												Perfect party game that is really, really good if you play it with friends because alone it´s good but it doesnt make that much fun and it gets boring. You can play competitive, campaign, versus ( humans vs. infected) ;), camapign solo etc. also there is a steam workshop that gives you so much extra content. The community is still revealing many mods for this game.  All in one a good game to play with friends  :).  8/10			"

												If you wanted to buy this game, take into account this.It depends fully upon how you plan to play.With friends?Sure, it'd be great if you got friends that you know will play with you in private.Without friends?No, do not try to play the game generally most of the time you'll encounter a very salty hate filled community of vote-kick spammers/whiney players but man, it's fun playing versus against randoms with a full team at your side.""salty community""So the game it'self, well it's left 4 dead it's fun and all got lots of mod maps too for various modes.It's a co-op game so singleplayer is a little tasteless to try, but it's a love-hate relationship if I ever saw one.You'll love it if you got a group with you, say three of your best friends who know how to play well but as always it can enduce hate and overall 'salt' people from being nice to rude [though that may be a understatement].For the average person who plays this game and plays without friends [beneath three of your friends agree to play with you] at their side, it's a bad idea to try playing.But if your smart like most of my friends, you'll play alongside your buds and generally do well and have fun ruining people's days if you play your team vs randoms.I wish VALVe had a no/neutral/yes in their rating system....

												I've had this game for year's, I got it back on steam over a year ago and been playing around on it some and decided to finally do a review. Well this is a all around extremely fun game, it has multiple campaign's along with 4 survivor's and tons of weapon's from melee to sniper rifle's to use, along with bomb's for you to use aswell. This game has ton's to do in it, and almost never get's old by far the best zombie game of it's time, even though the community isn't the best just getting some friends together makes this game a whole lot more fun, there's lots of challenges and mode's you can play on, along with a steam workshop to change up how the game looks.Left 4 dead 2 is a game I personally would recommend for anyone, it's fun, looks good, and has a all around great experience, you have multiple hours of mission's and campaign's to do along with different modes such as Versus or Mutation, or for a bigger challenge realism and expert, there's lots of infected type's in this game even the common infected can change depending on which map you're playing on, there's a lot of varieity in weapon's you can use and items to use in the game, you can use something from a Ak, to a pump shotgun, or a baseball bat to a fireaxe. This game has a lot to offer for anyone and will provide lot's entertainment and challenge's for them.			"

I will argue nothing less; this is the best zombie survival game I have ever come across, you can't dislike this game! Every aspect of this game is lovable, between the four witty unique characters, the eerie plot of the story themed campaigns, and the various gamemodes, weapons, and special infected. Left 4 Dead deserves every award it recieved.All in All Left4Dead2 is the best Most Original Zombie Game9/10 From MeSweep "

												Against not calming down delights concerning Left 4 Dead a little bit the strange intention of Valve to let out continuation only in a year after the original sounded. Fans fairly assumed that under the guise of the second part to us will offer the same Left 4 Dead only improved and finished. Actually, so it also turned out – here only completions so change Left 4 Dead 2 that after a game couple of hours in it already there are no wish to remember all the charges at all. History repeats itself. In Valve didn't begin to invent any fancy plot, it here it is simple to anything. Survived again four, around again the zombie and to reach a quiet place, it is necessary to pass five levels, each of which to a limit is saturated with dangers of death. Were replaced unless scenery – in the second part they any more so gloomy, we should spend a lot of time and on the open spaces filled in with the sun. However, and this change is made not for appearance, and for the sake of gameplay improvement. (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours).			"

												I'm having a blast playing this game. I can't believe I've had it so long in my library and never touched it. Pros:Very, very challenging.A lot of replay value.Team work is needed, communication is key.Very tactful / tactical. If you think you're going to run around in this game blasting zombies, you're in for a big surprise. Check all your corners and watch your six!The AI is not too terrible and can hold its own on Expert.Many game modes to choose from.The Expert mode does not bend over for casuals like some other games in the same genre.A healthy player base even after 7 years.Cons:Team Killing. There are a lot of trolls in this game that will join your game and TK you. I've experienced at least one per gaming session. This can be very frustrating if trying to do a map on Expert. It'd be nice if there was a Ricochet option (whatever damage you deal to teammates is done back to you instead) that was on by default.Toxic community. Playing on VS is a sure-fire way to get insults hurled your way -- even if you go through the entire campaign on expert. They don't tolerate beginners at VS even though they were beginners once.For maps that have require gathering scattered items during the middle of a Panic event, the AI is useless, making these events virtually impossible on Solo.The AI will stay back and fight rather than follow you and kite. This is mainly important when dealing with a Tank.Weapons feel rather bland, but they'll grow on you eventually.If you cancel a reload on Expert, you'll have to play out the entire reload animation all over again and your magazine count will be at 0 even if you had at least 1 bullet in it before.

												950+ Hours and counting.This sequel is #1 on my list of Recommended Games. The Left 4 Dead Series is an instant classic, released 7 years ago and it still holds up. Play alone or play with your friends (or strangers), you will enjoy this game for countless hours. L4D2 is an improvement to an already fantastic and entertaining game. Make new friends, or lose some, the game focuses on cooperative gameplay that will teach you how to be patient and make you a great team player. You can download new maps and customize the whole game with mods from the workshop. This is the Best Zombie Co-op game ever! Here are some pros:+Easy mechanics, no boring story-line+Community is alive and well (90% of the people on my friends list are from this game).+Endless mods on the Workshop. It's like walking into a grocery store.+Funny and witty Character Lines.+Melee Weapons+More Blood+New Survivors, New Campaigns, New Zombies.+Achievements that you will enjoy hunting for.+Cool Easter Eggs and Movie references.+Random jump scares every once in a while.+Boomer is still UglyI only have one Con though:-GOOD GUY NICK!!!10/10 Would kill all sons-a-♥♥♥♥♥es again!

												I can honestly say that Left 4 Dead 2 would be my favourite zombie multiplayer game right now. It's a sequel to Left 4 dead. Same concept but more features added. It adds newer maps, different characters, more playable special infecteds, and a bunch load of more weapons to slaughter zombies with. You basically travel through different areas with your teammates trying to find an escape route. What more can you say about it? It's a fun coop game where you can play with your friends or any other online players from across the world.     Besides from just going to different saferooms and finding an escape vehicle on a finale campaign on the same maps, there are other gamemodes you can play to eliminate the boredom. Survival is a great and challenging gamemode where your teammates and you have to try to survive on a map for as long as you can with the resources that will be provided around the map. Great mode for strategy and setting a goal for surviving for maybe longer than 10 minutes or even an hour. The longer the time, the more crucial it'll get. Versus is another gamemode you can also try out. Probably is the most popular and playful gamemode in the game. It's a fun and competitive game which consist of two teams. One as special infecteds and one who plays as the survivors. After completing a map, both teams will rotate positions depending on who won last round. The team with the most points after completing the finale will be declared as the winner. This I believe is the only gamemode where you actually have the ability to play as a special infected which is a fun feature in the game.     With some of the updates that Left 4 Dead 2 offered us, you can actually have the ability to play as the old characters and the old maps from the first Left 4 dead. This means that there are more maps for you to try out and more characters for you to select. You don't even need to purchase the first Left 4 Dead. Also adds two extra maps for you to play on such as ""The Sacrafice"" played by the Left 4 Dead characters and ""Cold Stream"" played by the Left 4 Dead 2 Characters.     If you get bored of just playing normal vanilla games, you can try out some of the special steam group servers. These servers are made by other people where they can provide special features in the game that originally aren't in the game. They bring out a new level of fun and diversity. A fort spawner server for Survival where you can build a fort/shelter to help you fight away the zombies. An RPG leveling system server for Campaign and Versus where you can level up your character and acquire unique  perks and abilities to make you much stronger to slay the infected.     I met most of cool online friends on this game. It has been here for a while now and is still a popular game to this day. I would extremely recommend getting this game if you're into horror, fun or just love smashing zombies with a frying pan. It's only $21.99, which is fairly a cheap price for a great game.			"

												""FIRE FIRE FIRE!"" ""BLACK MAGIC! THE FIRE JUST APPEARED UNDER MY FEET! HEEEELLPPP MEE......"" ""WHO THREW THE MOLOTOV?!""- What people usually say when I throw a Molotov at their feet and watch them burnLeft 4 Dead 2, even though it's a game about zombies and all that surviving and the end of the world apocalypse thing, is pretty silly. More to that later on. Right now we start off with the most important part of the review, the gameplay.Gameplay: It's fun. You get to kill hundreds of zombies with guns and FIRE and the most fun weapon in the game, the chainsaw. Helping your team out by whipping out your chainsaw and going chainsaw first in the horde is awesome. Its makes you feel like an immortal badass coming to save your teammates by cutting through those zombies and showing the tank who's the best. And that all feels great! Music: It has the creepy, zombie like feel to it. It just feels......like you’re in an apocalypse and there's no hope of surviving. It's that sad, zombie-like, songs that make you feel..........in that moment. Like you're there with what could be the survivors of the zombie apocalypse that will get through this chapter in human history! It feels like you're there, in the moment, in that place. And all that feels creepy and awesome at the same time.Community: There always will be noobs in the game, but that's alright since there are more people who know what they're doing and you have friends. The friends who sometimes screw you over, but always try to help you. If you're friends are not like that. I dont think you have the friends you should have. This game is so much fun with friends though. Valve did a amazing job of making you feel accomplished in there games, and this makes you feel accomplished.Graphics: They’re good. Pretty normal. Mods and add-ons: Who are you if you don’t play this game with mods? Do you know what the meaning of fun is? A doge flashlight, Coach in a shirt with cheeseburgers on it, and Nick as Nicolas Cage with Cage’s heads in random places around his shirt are one of the many. Mods are love, mods are life.What makes this game silly?Besides killing hundreds of zombies with a frying pan? Mods. There are so many silly mods out there for Left 4 Dead 2.What shouldn’t I get this game?If you don’t have many friends who have this game or aren’t willing to buy it or just don’t want to play with you. It can be tough playing this game along or with strangers who don’t talk much.Ending words:If the things I said about this review makes you want to be a silly badass, then get this game! I don’t see reasons unless don’t have many friends who have this game or any of the other reasons.7/10“Pills here”*Gaben voice* Thanks! And have fun! "

												This was the first game I bought for Steam. I had played the first one on Xbox for a little bit but never got to play often so I bought the second one for PC. I absolutely love this game (over 900 hours says something) This is a fun game to play, downloading mods, maps, and meeting some interesting people to play with. Playing with people is probably what makes me love this game so much because of how easy it is to make a new friend (or enemy) One of my favorite all time games. Definitely get it if you have the chance.			"

												The best cooperative game in the world, without a doubt.I don't know how to explain it- with this gaming series Valve created their own genre. It looks old and cliched, with the zombies, promises of teamwork and lots of guns, but ignore that: it's a surprisingly refreshing concept done in such an original way that there is nothing to compare it to. It was well received but I still think that this game was underrated. Left 4 Dead 3, if it ever comes out, will tip the world on its head. Best start preparing for it now with L4D2!The game DEMANDS teamwork, and actively encourages it. There is nothing to gain from running on ahead and leaving others behind, you're all in this zombie apocalypse together. It's amazing how you can join a server with 3 random people and within the space of a couple of hours, get to know each of them well enough that you want to add them all to your friends list.Much like GTA 5 or the Sims, this game has universal appeal. Yup, girls enjoy it too. I'm not going to say anything since I'll likely unintentionally come across as sexist, but I'll simply say that it's a testament to this game that everybody can enjoy it. I reckon that my parents would too if they would see past the gore.It may look as though it's you versus zombies, but you're really up against 'The Director'. It is a mysterious, invisible force who decides where to leave weapons and items lying around in the level. If you're doing too well, it'll chuck a crowd of zombies at you. 'The Director' shapes the pacing and feeling of the game and makes each play-through different to the last. It adds enormous replayability to a game that's already bursting with features and game modes.Oh yes, this game includes everything from the first game (rendering it completely obsolete), as well as 4 new characters with their own campaign spanning several separate worlds. You now have melee weapons, chainsaws, grenade launchers, vials-of-sick and deagles to aid you in your struggle against the undead. And The Director.But don't worry- the zombies have some new tricks up their saggy-skin sleeves as well. You have 6 special infected who are a match for lone humans, as well as sitting and walking witches and the almighty tank. You have armoured zombies who can only be shot from the rear, mudmen who scuttle quickly below your vision and smear your view and industrial workers with shiny jackets that make them sitting ducks. Idiots.You'll begin to fear the groan of the zombies. You'll get goosebumps at the sound of the musical cues. You'll love the sight of the saferoom and get a warm fuzzy feeling from using your medikit to heal a team member. This game has been a staple of my weekend nights for years and I'm still not tired of it. It's the perfect LAN game and as if the game wasn't good enough already, it also has a versus mode where you take in turns to be the special zombies and must stop the humans from achieving what ever it is those foolish creatures do when the world ends. I haven't played this mode nearly as much as I'd have liked and the idea of it still gets me excited all of these years later.In terms of fun / exciting / scary / frustrating things that you can squeeze into an hour of gameplay, Left 4 Dead wins hands down. The only down-side? The community isn't what it used to be. It's a real shame when you look at the server list and find so few people still playing. Expert mode is nigh on impossible to complete without some old hardcore friends joining to lend you a hand. You can forget expert realism!Even without real people, you can still play the campaigns against bots. The game is still worth it for that alone, though of course it is better with other real people. Do yourself a favour if you haven't already and give this game a go. There really isn't anything as polished or as well designed as this game and Valve must be very proud of themselves for making it first.			"

The worst - being those extremely rude,self-centred and intolerant people who kicks anyone who isnt perfect in their eyes. The nice - being those who help and give chances to new players. As a whole, l4d2 is a really fun game, despite times where u meet nasty people.			"

												Awesome zombie coop game. Even old, I still got some good fun moments with my friends playing some campaigns and versus sometimes; since I'm not into versus gamemode that much.You will get addict to this game for a time, then take a long break after hours and hours playing the same maps - but thanks to the Workshop, you can subscribe to a tons of mods, maps and skins for your own gameplay style. There are yet popular servers of 4x4 ; 10x10 coop styles.Again, Left 4 Dead 2 it's like an ""upgraded"" version from the L4D1: more special infected zombies, maps, new characters and you can still play the maps and the old characters from the first game. I strongly recommend you to buy this one first since it's better than L4D1. The workshop keep this game alive I believe. Enjoy!9.5/10			"

												It remains, and rightfully so, one of the best CoOp games of all times. Of course, as time passes graphics and some of the mechanics have become outdated - but the Steam Workshop makes sure that you can form and shape it into the game you want. As such, it is still worth to be played today.However, I want to encourage you to look for friends that are playing with you, as my experiences with public lobbies have been... mixed. If you wanna play on your own, the teammate AI is still acceptable.			"

Play it alone and this game is really good, play it with friends and it becomes awesome !From the moment you leave the safe house to the final rescue chopper, you are completely dependent on each other. Without your friends, you're dead. It's a cooperative FPS game you know.And remember, play together or die alone.9.8/10			"

												In this game you will be introduced with a high-school football “Coach” but with a bad knee, a cold and sarcastic gambler and con artist Nick, Rochelle who is a low level production assistant and reporting on the evacuation for local TV station and a friendly mechanic Ellis.As a start, the four survivors found themselves at an abandoned hotel roof by the rescue chopper. This is the start of Dead Center. So, they decided to reach the local mall where a second CEDA evacuation point is located. By their way after finishing correspondence with gun shop owner Whitaker, they discovered that the mall is overrun by infected. At such a situation Ellis helped the group to use a stock car and to travel towards New Orleans, probably the last standing city of America.The Passing stands in between Dead Center and Dark Carnival just after The Sacrifice. The four of the L4D2 survivors when arrive at the bridge of Rayford they meet Francis, Louis and Zoey. Since they need to cross the bridge so they four found the other way. After fighting their way through a wedding reception of witch bride, the streets and under the river tour they meet up again with the original survivors who provided covering fire while filling up the generator or lowering the bridge.Dark Carnival starts in a highway completely blocked by ditched vehicles. Starting from there survivors reached at an abandoned amusement park. At the park stadium Coach found a plan to use a large scale light show used by The Midnight Riders to signal the rescue chopper.Yet bad luck… they found the chopper pilot is infected! Naturally, Nick killed him and it crashed so also Swamp Fever starts. So, crossing the swamps the group finally arrives at plantation mansion and makes radio contact with Virgil, a boat captain. But his boat starts to run low on diesel on the way to New Orleans. Hard rain starts, the survivors go to shore at Ducatel. Crossing a witch infested sugarcane mill finally they get gas from gas station and return back with fuels to signal Virgil.Virgil drops the group at New Orleans where military is evacuating civilians across a bridge. But the four discovered that the city is completely overrun by infected and so the military is actually leaving the city before it is destroyed by air strike. However, survivors managed to reach the bridge and made contact with the military. Then crossing the bridge they were evacuated by chopper and the bridge was destroyed with the end of The Parish.All the best so far but the day is important because we have night!!! :) I don’t mean this for zombie apocalypse though!! :) So, foxed? :-D Well, you may encounter various types of trolls (special infecteds? :d), ... ... etc. etc. in the community when you will want multiplayer but just don’t let them feel you down ever to enjoy the thrills of the game because I assure you they are never more than a few. :)So, don’t you want to experience all these in more details playing the game by your own? I wanted all these learnings and hope you too. :)			"

												Are you looking for some zombie-survival fun with your friends? (Not looking at you, Walking Dead. Your game is boring!) Wait no more! This is what you and your friends are looking for. Play Campaign Mode, where you and your friends must pass through many areas from a map, full of hordes to shoot in their faces, and escape from the map. Just like a badäss!Play Survival Mode, where you and your friends must survive as many time as possible. Making you a time-attacking badäss!Play Mutation Mode, where you have many different ways to play and you must prove Chuck Norris how a mighty badäss you are in many ways!Play Versus Mode or Scavenge Mode, where in both modes you can be in the human team or in the zombie team, regardless of which team you are, your victory makes you more badäss!Don't miss the chance! If you miss it, we're going after you! Bring your friends, bring your colleagues, bring your mother, that's right, your mother!

												Want to play with friends and survive in a zombie apocalypse?  Then L4D2 is a game for you! I always had fun with a friend when playing online and it's easy to create your own lobby. Noteworthy, the more friends playing, the better. Having the  Director avaliable to change the gameplay everytime you play also helps to make sure the game doesn't becoming too boring. You can also crank up the difficulty for a challenge (be warned though that if you're playing in expert mode, bring 3 other friends)! One issue I had with this game were the origin of the weapons (in other words, the way the weapons were held). The original game was fine but now, they're too centered in the screen and/or take up too much space (like the hunting rifle). However, this issue can be ""fixed"" in the workshop by downloading custom content and there's even an add-on that re-origins the default weapons. If you cannot find something in the workshop that you want/like, don't worry as it's very easy to install custom add-ons (from other websites) through the L4D2 file directories. There is another problem I keep facing when playing online in public lobbies. Some players should have practiced more and adjusted to the game by playing offline but instead, they decided to rush in and don't provide too much help due to their lack of experience. Sometimes, there are trolls too and it may be necessary to kick them. The worst issue I had was versus in which players kept on leaving after dying as survivors. Still, this is a good game to play with friends and I recommend it.			"

												Man, all you ♥♥♥♥ are♥♥♥♥♥♥at this game, the only reason I still play it after the huge give away apocalypse (may god have mercy on our souls) is to make your experience of this game worse. Though this might only be applied to the Versus mod it's worth every second. Do not believe that I enjoy it any more than you do because you ♥♥♥♥ are on my team as well ruining my experience while having to defend you a bazillion times only to get kicked because I get accused of hacking by 1 hour players  (whom obviously can tell, because lets face it, everybody have the right to show their opinion and force their unexperienced beliefs on to other scrubs) or that my playstyle differs from that of a noob.Why the ♥♥♥♥ do I even bother, there's something called confogl out there and it exists for a reason, to keep you noobs at your place, not in one single point in your lifetime will you ever amount to anything in this game, I would suggest for you to keep playing campaign like I did for a longer of period of time and enjoy it with your ""FRIENDS"".I hope to see you all out there whomever plays with the Download Location (UK - London) and I hope we can get along. Yeah right, you really think that'd ever happen? I'll keep joining your servers only to find out that the other team only made it by 50 points and say to myself, why don't I go play confogl, this is pointless. But then I'd say, no, I'm doing this because I want people to believe that I am a narcissistic ♥♥♥♥ who don't do anything else but hack and cause a commotion.So, that was my review, and here are my humble scores :)Hit registration gets 2 out of 5 in public games, 4 in Hyper-VCommunity gets 1 out of 5 for obvious reasonsAl-qaeda gets 2 out of 5 for not trying hard enoughPubstompers get 5 out of 5 because they're with the right causeMedkits get 2 out of 5 because they're helping noobs succeedMouse-2 (m2) or Bash gets 5 out of 5 because it's underrated/// Your personal ""super-just-saiyan"" who've used the name holocaust for over 3 years so no, steam won't ban you for using this so called ""Offensive"" namehttp://x2.fjcdn.com/comments/5173596+_50c6ebb796c4b2f0785f073aa9f3edc9.png "

												Convinced my mom to get me a Steam card for my birthday which I used to purchase L4D2. I had played a bit of L4D1 before, but it doesn't compare to this one.  Every Valve game I've played has been fantastic, which includes Portal 1, 2 and L4D.  The Physics are hyper-realistic, the textures are flawless, and on top of all that beauty lies the fact that it runs very smoothly on my computer.  Not a whole lot of guns, but the realism and amazingness makes up for it.  Valve is doing fantastic work, now all we need is Left 4 Dead 3!			"

												Once you get past the bugs then it's a fun game to play. I've spent hours and hours on this game with friends and it's by far been the most fun I've had from any game that I have played before.Absolutely amazing game, definitely recommended for zombie lovers and a fun game with friends!

												So. First off, if you're looking for a hardcore, serious, emotional zombie game with a realistic storyline, KEEP LOOKING! This game has a bit of an Arcadish feel to it, as none of the characters are really serious about saving their own asses. Instead, they make funny remarks at activities like killing zombies. This game is awesome, except for one thing. THE FRIGGIN' COMMUNITY!!! Unless you have amazing skills or some friends to play with, do NOT buy this game. As soon as you make 1 mistake in  a Versus game, everyone calls you something like Dumbass! or F*cking Idiot followed by an amazingly fast votekick that litterally EVERYONE votes yes for. That's really what I hate, and it made the game extremely annoying. The game also gets very repeditive and boring. So, in summarry it's an awesome game, but you NEED friends to play it. So, unfortunately, I will have to rate this game down. I'm really torn about it, but the community sucks. It makes it IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY!!!			"

												One of my favourite games ever. 9/10.Great multi-player co-op game that still has a ton of replay value, six years later. Where it really shines is in Versus mode, where teams play against each other, taking turns playing as the Special Infected.  Left 4 Dead 2 is simply a must-have for all survival horror enthusiasts. The new game modes and the usual mix of adrenaline and co-op gameplay is the living(dead) proof that a sequel doesn’t always have to change its original nature to be enjoyable, very enjoyable!Before playing Versus mode, however, make sure you have played through Campaign mode completely at least once. Of course, story is for single player games, and L4D2 certainly isn't that. To get the most out of the game, you need to play it with three other people, especially on higher difficulties where the AI companions are all but useless. They'll do a good enough job at shooting zombies, but often get sidetracked at killing a few straggling common infected, while your busy fighting a Tank. Or, they'll continually shout ""We need to stick together!"" when you try and keep moving, but they just won't follow you. The most frustrating is during the game's gauntlet events, where you have to go and turn off something like an alarm, and the AI just won't keep up. If you don't have access to Xbox Live, Steam then L4D2 will get old really quick. I have played the game for over 500 hours on Steam. I have also played the game for 100 hours on Xbox. So I do have enough time to make a review on the game. With friends, the game is still a blast. The AI Director returns, and again changes the maps according to how well you are doing. If you're full on ammo and health packs, prepare to meet up with a host of special infected. Be on the verge of death with only a frying pan, however, and you won't face quite as many. And nothing is as exhilarating as going into a room to find a pipe bomb in one game, and trying to grab it in another game only to find a Witch sobbing in the corner.Versus mode returns, and is still the most fun of the bunch. In the eight player mode, four people are survivors, and four are the infected. All of the special infected return from the first game, including the repulsive Boomer, the ferocious Tank, and the creepy Smoker. Three new infected join the roster this time around, and fit in just great. The Charger is able to pick up a survivor, carry them, and pummel them into the ground. The Spitter spits deadly poison that lingers on the ground. And the Jockey can jump on a survivors back, steering them into danger zones such as fire or a Spitter's poison patch. Each type of special infected are unique and fun, and the addition of three more is just icing on the cake. Like the first game, playing as the special infected is still a blast - there's nothing quite like setting up an ambush with your fellow zombies to kill the survivors in Versus mode.Survival mode makes another appearance as well. Released as DLC in the first game, it comes to L4D2 mostly unchanged, having the four survivors face waves of endless infected coming to save them, with rescue never coming. It's fun.The environments are much more detailed and atmospheric. The rain effects are especially mind-blowing, and can make the threat of an oncoming zombie assault quite stressful when you can't see five feet in front of your face. The ways in which zombies die are also gruesomely spectacular. With the introduction of melee weapons, you can hack at certain body parts of the infected, taking off a leg, chunk of head, or outright decapitating them. Bullets also tear off flesh to reveal ribcages, and chainsaws literally rip the infected apart. There are some nagging clipping issues, such as having zombies' heads protrude through walls, or being able to walk through your allies.The sound direction is stellar, from the powerful gun shots to the creepy, ambient groans and moans warning you of nearby special infected. The soundtrack is fitting for the American South, but could've been longer, as it repeats itself too often. Though the core gameplay remains pretty much the same, there is more than enough new content and improved action to make this zombie apocalypse highly recommendable.The fact that there are addons makes the game even more enjoyable. Oh. One negative thing? I am seriously getting fed up with most of the L4D2 public community. Just blocked my 40th person, they spent the past two hours trash talking everyone on my team with horrible insults and claiming that we all hack (all because I shot a noisy boomer through a wall). People who join, suicide, then leave. Who accuse others of hacking. Who call ""RAGE"" every time someone leaves. Who blame the server for every failure. Who swap while people are still loading in, resulting in the affected player getting kicked by the swappers team.Oh and don't even get me started on the ""competitive"" players... (not to generalize... bad apples, you know...)It's not very often you get to meet nice, kind, great teamplayers. But once you do, it's a blast! Search for groups who focuses on having fun rather than winning.  It's worthwile. Trust me. Slash and hack!			"

												Hi everyone. I have to say that L4D2 is a very fun game to play especially with friends. I'll try to be as polite as possible. But I have to say this. Recently, there are more and more stupid & unreasonable players. And what I meant by that?Newbies and laggers, I'm fine with them. No harm at all, we can play slow and we can help each other up when we are incap. ( EMPHASIS: THESE 2 KINDS OF PLAYERS I'VE MENTIONED ARE FINE. THEY ARE COOL. I DONT MIND PLAYING WITH THEM)What I have to say is the community (NOT ALL), this community is getting more and more ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I was playing this game awhile ago, I was playing a public modded server. I saved like 3-4 players when they are incap. And there are players who keeps friendly firing me when I was saving the incap ones. It's fine still. But after I saved them, the players who friendly fired me voted to kick me. And everyone literally pressed F1. And I got voted out from the game, I saved people. And right after I got kicked, the players impersonated me. !@#$%&(*&^$#$% I'm so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off.So.. Guys, I would say that this game's community has ruined this game. Directly or indirectly, before getting this game, please think twice, or even thrice. Unless you are prepared to get kick by doing good deed and get shot down by stupid players.			"

												This is one of the best game ever. Plenty of fun with friends and a very enjoyable versus mode. The coop system is the best ever seen in the games history. The animations are incredibly fluid, some of the best I've seen so far in a game. The dialogues are great, the characters say a lot of different things and are never annoying or ripetitive. Definitely worth for buying. I'm not what you would call a ""video game person"", yet after playing this once, I've been obsessed with this game. Much better than the sequence (card game) and the infected characters are definitely worth the time ESPECIALLY THE SURVIVORS SINCE THEY'VE ADDED WORKSHOP , WHERE YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE THEIR CLOTHES THE GUNS GOD ITS EVERYTHING. Multiplayer! cooperative or competitive! Teamwork actually means something here. You can do more than just shoot guns. Controlling special abilitied Zombies is a unique experience. SCAVENGE MODE (OMG) You are not only feel like a member of your team, you need to cooperate every time and your team needs to coop back aswell or your brains will get eaten (kidding or then ""you wont get any chance against the other team (if they know the game more than u do) , btw there's always TUTORIAL about scavenge so u can go ahead and see those. PLAYING WITH FRIENDS AND THE ONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO PLAY IT WILL possibly the best teamwork oriented game ever, certainly the best with a still thriving community.			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 is the best zombie game.  The mass-horde, shoot 'em up style of gameplay works extremely well with the quality of game for which Valve is known.  AI on Left 4 Dead 2 is not without its hiccups, but it does a very nice job in place of breathing players.  Online play adds a whole new dimension to the game with a multitude of different modes, ensuring that the game never quite gets old.			"

												Left 4 Dead gave me my start in online gaming.  My noobiness was easily forgiven by the zombies, however, if you play with other players, be prepared to hear a little bit of criticism, especially if you do versus.  Overall, I really enjoy this game and I am quite pleased that Valve incorporated the first Left 4 Dead maps into it. However, the original maps are starting to get a little old despite the recently added Cold Stream, but, having said that, this is still one of my most favorite games.  So, if you are looking for a good game to play with other people and have a few drinks, Left 4 Dead can offer you a good time!Still hoping for a third installment! L4D3! L4D3! L4D3!! :D			"

												I gave this game several tries, but I just can't recommend this game. It's very difficult to finish a Versus match without having the cancerous community kick you. This is the perfect example of a great game ruined by its community- I have never seen the kick option be so abused in a game before.If you have a group of friends with you, then you should be set. Playing by yourself is another thing. You will be kicked constantly- often for no reason at all. I actually found myself kicked for healing one teammate over the other(who were both in the same shape).Save your money and time- this game's horrid community will anger you if you decide to play alone, as it did for me. This is a game that I only recommend playing with friends. You'll find yourself lucky to find a server that isn't full of elitist morons.			"

												I just love it. The first and most important thing - zombies!!! And, of course, killing them with all possible ways: guns, melee, molotoves, grenades...Second one: I really love all ups and downs of it, all people I met there, killing zombies with different weapons, all mutations and mods. It's an incredible experience to spend your time in this game. The same level can be boring when playing with good teammates and incredibly difficult when playing with newbies.When you have enough, it's easy to make it more exciting by finding new place to defend (you can always count on me with this :) or a mutation or add-on map.You just need to try it.Versus on the other hand... I've been avoiding it for years/hours. Started playing it with a group of friends and can't stop it now :)			"

												While L4D2 improves upon the original in many meaningful ways, it fails to recapture the same magic.While I was never one of those people who threw their arms in protest when L4D2  was announced, I was nonetheless a bit skeptical as to whether or not a fully fledged sequel, After spending time with L4D2, I can with no uncertainty say that this game is indeed a true sequel, as opposed to a glorified expansion pack. The sequel not only provides a new setting (one with more character when compared to the original), new characters, new weapons and new enemies, but entirely new gameplay mechanics. It feels fresh and new and yet at the same time, comfortingly familiar.L4D2 is an improvement over the original in almost every aspect. But it fails somewhat in one major aspect, it just doesn't feel as magical or expertly crafted as its predecessor.			"

I've played this game for over a year on Steam.Sadly, the community ruins the game. The game is awesome but the community simply ruined my Left 4 Dead experience.I hope Valve will put the option to mute players from sending a message and voice chat in the next game or I'm not going to get it. Also, not many people are playing this game because they are no games when I search for online games (in Asia). Basically people play this game just to blow off some steam and rage at each other.

												More than 4 years after its release, this is still one of the very best (if not the best) co-operative FPS shooter, where teamwork is highly emphasized but you are also given complete freedom at doing whatever you want, although if you want to succeed easily in the missions, you will learn to enjoy and appreciate constant communication with your teammates. The concept of the game has been clearly very well thought-out and over 400 hours later, i am still drawn to play this game and it never gets old. The campaign missions are great to familiarize yourself with the maps, the settings, the gameplay, the different infected and their distinctive attacks. Everything balances itself out at every turn. But the real strength of this game is its multiplayer. You simply cannot experience the full force of Left 4 Dead, without having played its many multiplayer modes. There are so many different game possibilities and different objectives. It is one of the very few games that can keep me going for several hours, irrespective if i'm tired or sleepy - the adrenaline rush just keeps me awake and the feeling of satisfaction if you work well as a team is simply tremendous.There are also private game servers which offer even more customizable game modes. The standard versus mode for the official game is 4 vs 4. But on third-party servers, you will encounter 10 vs 10, which changes the game by enabling more chaos and way more fun. I highly recommend that you try it if you ever get tired of the official game modes and want to try something new and even more exciting.			"

One Word, ""Friends"" You need friends that already have this game in order for it to be a fun experience, why? Well, here's the two main reasons why-Poorly Programmed A.I:No one wants to play a game with A.I that is downright awful when it comes to being a team contributer, they can't use melee weapons(Without mods, and please, if you do buy this, get one of those mods first) or use throwables, mods or not. They seem to enjoy following you around when you've been humped by a jockey and running away to save someone else who is not in the danger you are. They waste medical supplies and are just downright awful. Not to mention the enemy A.I is far more programmed, putting an unfair tip of the scales when you're playing alone, and it only gets worse from that point on.-Horrid Community80% of this games community are self-centered, degrenrate, rude, racist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s most likely under the age of 12 who make it their sole goal to ensure you have a horrible time playing with them. With random kicks, constant hate for a simple slip up and consuming valuable supplies like a fat man at an 'All you can eat"" Buffet. I've played with a lot of bad players in the past, but this game takes the cake when it comes to a horrible community.Now, this does sound bad, but seriously, this is a fun game with the right team a training, sure, not all of the community members are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but sometimes you luck out and get put in a lobby woth decent players. I do like many things about this game, but the two reasons above state that I encourge you not to buy this game unless you've got buddies willing to play with you, it does add many good things being a sequel anyway.Bottom line, if you got buddie s who want to play this with you? By all mean, get it, you won't regret it			"

												Alright, I think I'm finally due for a review...Back in 2008, Left 4 Dead caught my eye.  The idea of zombies, (How original, amirite, although It was a bit newer back then.) slicing their heads off, blowing off their legs with pipe bombs, and listening to them die to fire sounded freaking AWESOME.  So I pre-ordered it.  (I was a console peasant back then)Let's just say it ruined my life in a very, very bad *ahem* good way..By the time Left 4 Dead 2 was announced in 2009, I had already skipped school so many times continuing was probably pointless.  I hadn't seen my family more than for dinners in months and oh god was it so good. (I'm regretting it now, don't worry.)  So I pre-ordered it again.  (PEASANT.  ;_;)Well yet again I lost my life.  Left 4 Dead probably was the cause of me dropping out of school twice.  And you know, the xbox community (this is back when there were people actually playing) actually wasn't half bad, or so I thought.BOOM.  I have a computer.  Got both the games.  Didn't play 1 much, as I've already played way too much of it.  Left 4 dead 2 Scavenge mode was my absolute favorite on xbox, and now on PC even more so.  Versus I didn't want to get into, as in Left 4 Dead 1 I played way too much of it and got burnt out.  I learned so many new things and tricks that you just couldn't possibly do on a controller.  I met new friends, and with the lovely (xx hours in the last 2 weeks) tracker, I stopped playing so frickin' much.  (okay, sometimes.) The community here, even if it is filled with a bunch of cocky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, is obviously, better.  I definitely recommend this game.   If you're looking for a good zombie game to play, this one is great.  It's so simple, yet there is always room for improvement.  I doubt many people don't own it these days, as its always on frickin' sell.  If you don't have it, buy it already.Just a few tips:Learn the infected classes.  Like how the hunter needs to crouch before he can pounce in some way or another (more complicated moves are saved for later), and other stuff having to do with the infected.This game is team based.  Your teammates matter.  If your teammates are struggling, help them, unless you are absolutely better off going alone (I can only think of a few scenarios).  If your teammates can't cover you and you're 'MLG PRO B@$$' don't be all 'g3t on my l3v37 n00b', switch freaking places with them.  That's your only hope.  You don't go solo here. Same with infected.  Don't go solo.  Unless you're amazing and its a death charge, just don't.  You time your attacks accordingly, and work together to achieve the best results.Remember, all of the best teams you will ever run into in Left 4 Dead 2 certaintly know that working together is essential.  They just do it better than us.Use a mic + headphones / headset at all times.  Most people will get very annoyed if they can hear your game through your microphone, and let me tell you, trying to play a team based game with a mute person is not fun.SHOOT ALL THE THINGS.Gameplay Modes:CampaignStart by playing Campaign, either Solo or with friends.  Learn the controls up and down, & attempt to get the general rhythm of playing as a Survivor.You can either play campaign solo with single player and computer controlled teammates, or you can play Co Op.  I strongly preferred Co Op, as single player can be boring.  It is much funner to play while you joke about with your friends.  We have a few difficulties, start from Easy and work your way up.  Or, screw it all and play expert for the lulz!  I know I did that a few times with some friends, and it was hilarious.SurvivalPlay Survival for fun sometimes, its frustrating as you WILL die, but play it with your friends, and it will help you learn how to play as a team.This gamemode is generally you and three other survivors duking it out on the map of your choice, against an endless horde of zombies and special infected.  The special infected are computer controlled.You can play this alone or with teammates, but it's pointless without teammates.  This gamemode is great not only for trying to achieve an amazing time and the pure fun of that (and rage), but also because it will help improve your team working skills.  This is important.VersusWhen you feel like you understand the Infected classes and you feel comfortable playing as a team.In this game mode two teams of four go head to head.  One starts as Survivor, one as Infected.  The general goal as an infected is to kill the other team as fast as you can while working together, or if you are on the Survivor side, to make it to the end with all of your teammates alive.  Each time a section of a map ends, you replay that map as the other class.  Whichever team has the most points at the end wins.If you can, get a few friends together for a large versus game, where you won't run into a bunch of cocky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who don't remember they were new once too.  Otherwise, ♥♥♥♥ em' and just try to hold your own in a versus game.  You may get kicked, but don't let it get you down.  It's okay to make mistakes, that's how we learn, that is how we all learned.  Some people just forget that little fact.ScavengeWhen you feel like you understand the Infected classes and you feel comfortable playing as a team.This game mode is like versus.  Except you play on one map, and one map only, for a number of rounds.  The point as the Survivors is to fill the generator on the map with gas cans, and the gas cans will be spread out across the map (easily visible, so no worries there).  On the other hand, the infected are trying to stop you.  They want you to either not get all the cans, or to get them all very, very slow.You switch back and forth and the winner of each round is determined by either who gets the most cans, or if it's a tie, whichever team got them all the quickest.Ahh, the game mode that sucked me in and took my life from me.  Scavenge is really fun.  But be warned, a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s chill in this gamemode.  Brush yo' shoulder off.MutationsWhenever.Fun gamemodes that you can and should play with your friends.  You can play them alone too, though.  I haven't played them all so I don't think I can accurately portray them, but they are fun.Realism & Realism VersusRealism is campaign but on crack.  You can't see each other through walls anymore, you're basically relying on each other to stick together.  Other aspects of the gameplay are hard too, like zombies taking more damage.  Great team building gamemode.Realism Versus is basically versus with realism thrown in it ^ (read above)			"

												This game is honestly a classic and deserves to be in every single persons steam library. Whether it be because of the teamwork based gameplay, the extensive (and i mean, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥huge) mod list for this game, or the generally pretty helpful community, this game does it all. I purchased it on sale when it was only 5 dollars but it is easily worth buying even at the price it is at now. The first game i was in was a survival mode somewhat like Call of Duty Zombies except with no in between round wait time, some pretty chill dudes were explaining to the lobby how to get into a glitch that lets you survive longer (yes it is an old game, there are LOTS of glitches). They were helpful and definitely not rude, although i am sure as i play this longer i will run into a few rude people. Ive read reviews and they made me hesitant to purchase, some saying the community is toxic and will kick you for even a small mistake and stuff like that. Anyway, im sure someone will start b1tching, ""you only have a few hours you havent even played it yet"" and yeah, theyre right. On pc i barely have time logged into this game. This game was also on xbox 360, which i played extensively for hours on end. Same game, just a different platform. Anyway, it is a pretty cool game and thanks to the huuuuuge mod catalog, this game has near infinite playability. Sure, it might not be for everyone but i think this is a game most people would definitely enjoy. Buy it and give it a shot! Also, add me if youre down to play it cause itd be cool to have a few friends to play with. Its a game that requires a lot of teamwork and communication, especially on the higher difficulty levels.

 Best Ways to Get Rid of Zombies  Anti-zombie arsenalGuns. Of course. Whenever you see a zombie movie, guns are the weapon of choice. And I use the term “guns” loosely. From a 9mm to a harpoon to a grenade launcher to a slingshot loaded with cherry bombs, guns can be a fun and effective way to get rid of zombies. Use them for target practice, set up sharp-shooting contests, or engage in zombie hunting escapades. It’s a fun outdoor activity for the whole family!Shovel. It’s good for digging, but more importantly, it’s good for whacking zombies. It can also be used for beheading. Y’know, removing the head and destroying the brain? Other than zombie whacking, shovels can be used for zombie poking, zombie prodding, zombie battering, and zombie dismemberment. You can find them in most garages, they fit into the back of any old pickup, and you can even use that shovel in your garden after the crash of civilization. Amazon has a fine selection, like this Ames True Temper beauty.Ax. For those preferring a more hands-on eradication of zombies, consider the ax. Exercise those upper body muscles and get a good cardio workout with each swing and hack. Use your ax to remove the head or destroy the brain. Or simply immobilize the zombie threat by removing its limbs. Use the ax to cut down trees to create a fence for a zombie fight ring. Invite your friends. Think of the entertainment value! Best Ways to Get Rid of ZombiesRemove the head or destroy the brain to get rid of zombies. This is the most basic principle of destroying the ravaging zombie horde. It relies on the assumption that the infected zombie brain sends brain-eating messages to the zombie body. Sever this connection between zombified brain and undead body and you are left with the simply dead instead of the undead. Without the motor skills or motivation to devour brains, the zombie becomes indistinguishable from any old corpse lying around. Use whatever means you have at hand. Then consider composting the remains for your garden. Though soylent zombie is not recommended as it may spread the zombie virus. And taste terrible.Chainsaws can get rid of zombies. If it’s good enough for Bruce Campbell as Ash in Evil Dead, it’s good enough for you! Perhaps this most classic method of zombie destruction and removal is what’s best for you. This will not only remove the head or destroy the brain, but can also disembowel, de-limb, quarter, massacre, destruct, and generally discombobulate zombies. Two drawbacks with this method include the splatter zone and the chainsaw wielder’s close proximity to zombie teeth. This method is best used on slower moving zombies with poor motor skills. And don’t forget to take along your raincoat.A tiger pit can help you get rid of zombies. This is an oldie but a goodie. Using the shovel from your anti-zombie arsenal, dig a deep pit. Think grave-deep, at least. Then, using your anti-zombie ax, fashion some grotesque wooden spikes out of some local trees or remnants of old wood picket fences. Securely embed the spikes at the bottom of the pit. Cover the hole with a sheet or tarp or any other pliable surface. Cover that surface with leaves. Consider using a decoy, such as an irritating in-law for bait, and you have yourself a genuine pit of doom for any wandering zombies.Get rid of zombies using a wood chipper. If perhaps your zombie type is of the slow-moving and easily tricked variety, a wood chipper is an excellent way to remove yourself of these unwanted zombies. Consider a type of tiger-pit strategy with perhaps a human or another zombie as bait. Using a wood chipper will not only remove the head or destroy the brain of zombies with unadulterated gusto, zombie chunks may yet prove a useful source of natural fertilizer, or even a natural biofuel. Just don’t forget your safety goggles.Wait for the zombies to decay. This method relies heavily on the type of zombie infestation that you have. This will not work on every kind of the undead. But it may be that the type of zombie around your neighborhood doesn’t have a very long shelf-life. If your zombies are the type that cannot regenerate or repair their own tissue, then hot-dang, all you have to do is wait it out! Exposure to the elements will wreak havoc upon undead tissue. And as they begin to decay, their ability to acquire brains from human beings also decays. Soon these ferocious brain seekers will only be piles of goo, and your life can once again return to normal. Things to avoidFire. While fire may seem to be a natural, cheap, and easy solution to your zombie infestation, I assure you that fire is most likely not the answer. You know how those zombies are, always getting into everything. Curious little creatures they are. Now, can you picture those curious little biters on fire?Nuclear arms. Nukes. Good for killin’ the whales. Bad for killin’ the zombies. Imagine a bunch of brain-crazy, undead cannibals hell bent on eating you. Now imagine that they’re radioactive to boot. You get where I’m going with this. So, unless you’re into killing whales, avoid the nukes. "

												Now I really wanted to give this game a good review because it's an excellent example of Valve's work. The characters and story are very believable and weapons and gameplay are for the most part excellently balanced. On top of this there is workshop support which means endless fun and mayhem in LFD2.But unfortunately, this is heavily tainted. The only problem I have with this game is the god awful and poisonous community which inhabits it's every nook and cranny. Some people who play this game are downright mean and clearly have something wrong with them.Most of these are so called 'Pros' and veteran players who infect the game community like cancer. Newbies get no chance and no mercy when playing this. It has been proven many times. Whenever there is a sale for this game you'll see ♥♥♥♥♥ing and whining from the ♥♥♥♥sacks who have no life and sink over 2.5K hours into this game. So you bought the game with your hard earned money and want to have a go at the multiplayer modes?""♥♥♥♥♥U FGGT NOOB GET ON MY LVL"" *Insta kick* is the reply you'll get from people when you don't do good enough at the game.So as far as i'm concerned, only buy this game if you have some trusted friends you can get on and play with or you can handle playing single player with bots only (which is good still). Or if you really must play with random people, brace yourself for the name calling, swearing and downright bigotry that is on display in the game and on the forums too.That is all.			"

												Left4Dead2 is Left4Dead2!One of the best, bloodiest and funniest zombie-shooters. Unlike the previous part, now you have a variety of choices how and with what you're going to kill hordes of zombies. New special infected, new weapons (melee, shotguns, sniper, rifles and grenades), new medicine and of course new characters and new game modes. Also the large workshop with new campaigns, skins, sounds and a lot of useful stuff for any taste.It is also great that there is an ability to play the campaigns from the first Left4Dead and there is a connection between the characters from both parts.If you like zombie apocalypse theme, then this is the game you must play!

Community in versus mode are nowhere near polite, it is true you can find some good people, but other then that, it is terrible. You do get judged by time you spent in this game, by how you play, by what you say, by your score done as Infected, by everything they can judge you, it is not 2009 anymore,   so you get your juice sucked from everything you bring in.

												While Left 4 Dead 2 had a rocky start, Valve greatly improved the quality of the game after release. In almost every way L4D2 replicates it's predecessor and surpasses it at the same time.L4D2 unlike it's predecessor has maps that take place during the day. It features more special infected that require constant movement and cover. And it features melee weapons that add an entirely new dynamic to gameplay. All of these features are woven very well with the carried over elements from L4D1. The game still requires players stick together inorder to avoid being pounced by legions of undead and it keeps the frantic fast paced atmosphere. Alongside that, the game's versus mode adds a great deal of strategy to the gameplay. And lastly it's survival mode allows players to test their skills and provide a nice healthy amount of competition amongst each other.I'd go as far as to say L4D2 now is one of Valve's best attempts at multiplayer games on the Source engine. Harder, Faster, Better and Stronger in almost every way.			"

												If you never played the first L4D, I recommend picking up JUST L4D 2. It's a fun, fast paced zombie shooter with a twist. The game and story are well worth playing and even has replay ability due to having versus, and survival game modes. The steam workshop makes this game even better with the ability to have your characters look like people from Walking Dead, Nightmare before Christmas, Dota characters, funny sounds and even weapons and items. I found it very amusing and worth playing with some friends. Rating: 8/10			"

What i like so much about valve games is the amount of time the valve developers spend on perfecting all the tiny details that shape the universe from their games which makes left 4 dead 2 a little special.But as nice as this game is i have a few things that worry me. Even though the game itself is a jewel worth playing in more than one way, in the various lobbies i created i keep running into people who join the team but only care for themir own needs. They don themselves as experts or pros or even both sometimes but in reality all that ever happens is that these players start rushing the maps while other players nomatter how often they have played this game don't get a proper oppertunity to get a taste of the athmosphere and as a result get isolated from the rest.In some cases you even get an immature big fat mouth from them when things don't go their way. It's a problem i have noticed eversince i started playing this game. Needless to say in time my preferance for short plays in spare time went over from co-op to using the standard bots which i really regret but is a problem i often hear from the gamers i know.With that in mind we can all jump high or low about it but it is the way it is. The best i can recommend is to play this game with good friends because let's be honest that's what you have friends for. Especially with left 4 dead 2. Wouldn't it be a big waste to let an awesome game like this be overshadowed by a bunch of underage anons who never learned what gaming is all about?			"

												Many people love L4D2, following the incredible success of L4D. Personally, I think this game is a heap of♥♥♥♥♥♥/b> - and I love just about every other Valve game.Technically and graphically, it is better than L4D, and unfortunately, that's the only part it is better. In everything else, it stinks.Gone is the atmosphere, the friendly rivalry between Louis and Francis, the grainy 70's film effect (seriously, wtf were you thinking), dark brooding cityscapes, and the witty repartee between all four members.Instead, you get four unlikeable characters that spend more time whining and ♥♥♥♥♥ing at each other, bright sunny days in New Orleans, and near constant waves of zombies.In fact, that is the main thing that irks me about the sequel. In the first one, if you had a strong member of the team, there was a fair chance they could pull the the rest of the team through, which made for some hectic, but fun, gameplay.In L4D2, there is no chance of that. The waves are too relentless and the specials spawn far too frequently, so if the team is a little disorganised, you're ♥♥♥♥ed with a capital F.Once the game decides it is going to target you, that's it until you either run of medkits or the team gets tired of trying to protect you. More often that not, you're spawning back at the safehouse, because one player got boomed, jockeyed and then incapped in the spitter goo. Cue ragequitting from less invested members of the team. The fun factor just shines through at that point (/sarcasm)I've tried hard to like this game, really I have. God knows I've put enough hours into it, but I just can't bring myself to like it in any way shape or form. In fact, I've gone from trying to like it to hating it, and have completely removed it off my PC. If I could delete it from my Steam library, I would.L4D may have had it's flaws, but it certainly had atmosphere and characters you could warm to, and my final verdict is that L4D2 does not hold a candle to it.To sum it up - in the first game, you felt like you were all fighting against hordes of zombies. In the second one, it feels like you are fighting everything in the game - zombies, weather, terrain - some maps are just a slow grindingly weary slog from start to finish.It's cheap enough to pick up for a bit of fun, and you might like it, but I seriously can't recommend it when the preceding game was far FAR superior in gameplay.

												I originally got this game because a friend convinced me to. I was hesitant because it was a zombie game and I didn't handle well in the Call of Duty: Nazi Zombies game. After I bought it, I noticed very quickly that this game makes friends FAST! It promotes teamwork between 4 players known as survivors, as they try to make it to the CEDA extraction point.Specifically, this story follows Nick, Ellis, Coach, and Rochelle. Each character has a personality of their own, unlike Gordon Freeman or Chell from other Valve games. Nick was a gambler, according to the commentary, he looted his white suit to survive in style. He often sounds stern, and serious about their situation. As in Dark Carnival he says in response to Coach and Ellis's excitement, ""Now we can die there as adults.""Ellis is a child at heart, and he is known as the mechanic of the group. If the player stays in the safehouses long enough, Ellis will tell a tale from his pre-apocolyptic life with his friend Keith. He is very happy about anything, and no he's not crazy, he still hates zombies. He's a native to Georgia which is where the story takes place.Coach is sort of a mix between Ellis and Nick, he is serious at times and at other times, like in Dark Carnival, he can be quite happy. I actually don't know much about his character, but I do know that he also is native to Georgia.Rochelle is commonly known by the community as the one with the annoying laugh. She is caring towards Ellis and often refers to him as ""sweety"" when he trails off on one of his stories. I don't know much about her either, but she is mainly for the girl gamers to play as.This game also brings the four together with the original four survivors Bill, Francis, Louis, and Zoey. This happens in The Passing. The game also is appealing because it adds L4D1 campaigns too, so you've got plenty of levels to entertain yourself. The important thing is that the game has amazing replay value! Just beating the levels isn't enough to wear out this game! You also can't forget the workshop, which adds campaigns, survivors, weapons, and zombies that can change the game in dramtic ways!			"

												I simply can not write this review without saying one thing.Old but gold.Thats it.L4D series in general is an amazing zombie killing, non stop action endorsing first-person shooter that is still being played to this date.Now I have played a lot of both games off steam back in the day and the biggest fun factor is getting your friends and you all group up as you try to survive  the butchering hordes that are chasing you. Singleplayer aspect of the gameThe gameplay is simple to understand, reach the safe house or get absolutely slaughtered.Throughout your campaign you will meet many survivors who have fallen to the green flu.Raging from the common infected,to the special infected and up to a mini boss a tank.There are in total 6 special infected,with the 7th one being the tank and a not so commonly found witch.The campaigns are not that difficult to complete,in fact after a couple of hours you'll be rushing trough them like a bowling ball trough pins.Now thats for the singleplayer. Multiplayer aspect of the game Multiplayer is currently experiencing a bit of a bad time.Not just now but for years.And as much as I love this game and trust me I do, I cannot encourage you to get it if youre aiming to play with random people.If youre gonna play it with your friends then of course get it right away.But If you get it to play multiplayer with randoms you will be kinda disappointed.I've seen people being kicked in versus mode for the smallest things,even being kicked for having a name that someone doesnt like.Random kicks are always being voted and it seems to never stop.I love this game but some people take the multiplayer down to the drain with such acts.My final verdict for L4D2 is 8/10.If you're gonna play it with some friends,get it right away.Hell even if you wanna play with randoms get it.But keep in mind what I said.Thank you for your time.

												This is one of the best zombie games i've ever played and still playing it as of this time. The plot is nice,with different modes to choose from. Whether you wanna play this as a single player,co-op Multiplayer,vs,scavenge or survival.,this game has it all. You will not get bored playing it coz there are tons of custom maps out there that supports it. I usually play custom maps with my friends out there and we had a lot of fun playing it. Gameplay is nice,with adequate supplies and variety of guns to choose from. You also have the option to change skins and add these customizeable maps that you normally get from the workshop or gamemaps itself. My only gripe in this game is when you're already at the safe house,A.I still manages to spawn some zeds out of thin air which is kinda annoying IMO. Well,other than that if you have left 4 dead the original this is certainly a great addition to your zombie game collections out there. Will i recommend this game to a friend? Well definitely i will. It's of those top tier games of 2009 and still kicking and got lots of servers out there til now :DGo and grab your copy now :D10/10 Cheers XD			"

												This game is an unbelievable zombie survival game with loads of different game modes to play. The gameplay is much more fun as a multiplayer allowing people to choose servers that they prefer. Admins can tweak game modes and rules to their spec to make the game more fun or challenging. The game has loads of different weapons to choose from and also has the original campaigns from L4D1. In versus mode you can play as a survivor or the undead. The undead have different classes such as smokers tongue ability to hold the victim, spitters venom that damages the survivors and hunters pounce which pins down the survivor. Overall a brilliant fps game with plenty of replay value. 92%			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 is a cooperative first-person shooter and the sequel to Left 4 Dead.The sequel picks up one week after the events of the first game where The Infection has spread to the southern United States. Left 4 Dead 2 introduces new weapons, melee weapons and new items. There is a new cast of human Survivors, which include: Coach, a portly high-school football coach with a bad knee; Nick, a rude and cynical gambler and con artist;Rochelle, a low-level production assistant reporting on the evacuation for a local television station; and Ellis, a friendly mechanic.The game also introduces three new Special Infected: The Charger, The Spitter and The Jockey.Left 4 Dead 2 currently has thirteen campaigns playable in all gameplay modes, six of which are from the original Left 4 Dead. The game has 4 different game modes: Campaign, Versus, Survival and Scavenge.During Campaign, also known as Co-op, up to four players work together to try to reach the end of the campaign by fighting their way past large numbers of AI-controlled Infected. There are four difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, Advanced and Expert.Versus is the basic competitive mode for the Left 4 Dead series: two separate teams of four players take turns playing as the Survivors and the Infected competing for the most points.The point of Survival Mode is to hold out for the longest time, with times being saved and virtual medals being awarded for surviving for certain amounts of time.Scavenge is a competitive gameplay mode in Left 4 Dead 2. It is a round based game in which Survivors have a limited amount of time to find up to 21 gas cans to fuel up a generator (or car), while fighting against player-controlled Special Infected much like in a Versus game.As in the first game, each scenario is presented like a movie. At the start of the game there is a movie poster showing the cast. At the end the ""credits"" display the statistics for the game, like who killed the most zombies, who inflicted the most headshots and so on. The final credit shows how many zombies were killed in the making of the film and also the film is dedicated to the memory of those survivors who did not make it to safety.Every aspect of Left 4 Dead has been refined and tweaked to perfection. It has brilliant graphics and a nice cinematic feel. The new campaigns and unique game modes offer more variety and more longevity, while all the other additions and tweaks make the already great gameplay even more enjoyable. Even the AI has improved a little bit, and while they still aren't big on using pipe bombs or Molotovs and are prone to missteps, they seem to have a better grasp of tactics and will follow you a bit more closely. Still, Left 4 Dead 2 is best enjoyed with friends.It is an addictive and atmospheric game and it is in my opinion one of the best co-op games ever made.Sounds 9/10Graphics 9/10Gameplay 10/10Atmosphere 9/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												I'd say L4D2 is within top 3 cooperative non-grind survival game you can enjoy without ever getting bored or find yourself with no variety of maps & modes to play. No matter casual or hardcore player a multitude of gamers can enjoy this experience in any playstyle they wish. Valve also gives a lesson to MANY horde survival / objective games in how you execute a near perfect difficulty system.[✔]> one of few the games that reward you for teamwork> big amount of official game modes > mod support (maps, guns, sounds & models)> very fluid gameplay> melee & guns variety> strong visuals for it's time> relevant difficulty slider[✘]> need friends to enjoy it> VS playerbase will kick you for every ""mistake""> jockey has bigger hitbox than it looks like			"

Oyunda belirlenen senaryoları bitirme olarak amaçlayan bu oyun oldukça güzel. Vuruş hissi güzel oynanabilirlik gerçekçilik hissi biraz zayıf. Oyunda VS mod mevcut 4 vs 4 olarak zombiler ve insanlar olarak hayatta kalma yarışı yapabiliyorsunuz. Belirli periyodlar ile ilerlerken silahlar itemler bulunuyor. Oyunda mermi sıkıntısı yok belkide güzel tarafı budur Kısaca bu tür oyunları seviyorsanız ve hala DayZ almadıysanız kesinlikle DayZ almalısınız.

												Before posting this review, it thought: ""hey, let's have a look to the negative comments to see wha- wait. What the hell is this?""People complain about it having bad graphics, crashing when starting, not being suited to be classified to survival, or horror, etc, etc. I mean, seriously.First of all, Left 4 Dead is an awesome game about TEAMWORK. Yes, teamwork. I see people complaining about being kicked from versus. Playtime: 1-2 hours. What do you expect when you don't know how to play properly? I'm not saying I'm a pro, but it's been blood and sweat to become decent at this game, running it on a crappy notebook, at 10-15 fps on hordes. You can do better than complaining on reviews. You could actually play the game. Learn how to share first-aids, pills, adrenalines, use defibs, when to use stuff. That's only learned by playing campaings, watching gameplays and so on.Secondly, before buying a game, the best you can do is find a torrent and download it; watch gameplays on YouTube, read critics on the internet, and then try it on your own. If you like it, buy it. If you don't like it, don't. If you got it free, then don't complain unless it's useful. There are lots of ways to try a game before buying it. Lastly, people complain about online players being rude and mostly rage quitters. This is not completely true. However, I do agree that the community is not as warming and welcoming as it used to be. This is because the amount of players playing it has increased considerably, leading to people who cannot handle losing, people who consider themselves gods of L4D2, etc. Is this only their fault, though? I highly doubt it. People who complain about others mistreating them, usually tend to hide the fact that it might also be their fault. It's not hard to say ""could anyone help me, I'm new on this game"". It's not hard to make friends on this game. I have made lots of them playing versus, and my friends too. It's about the attitude towards how you behave against others.L4D2 is a great game. Enjoyable. A bit repetitive. But what game isn't after playing it for 80+ hours. Tell me RPGs are not about killing monsters over and over again, or others FPS are about killing guys, looting stuff, etc. Think before posting a review. Is it your game crashing? There are forums where you can post your problem. Is it that you didn't like it because of unknown reasons? Give good reasons stating the facts that make it bad. But most important, change your attitude towards the game, and online players. I'm not speaking only for newcomers, but also for those so-called pros who mistreat newcomers on versus.			"

												The game itself is ok (personally, I prefer the first part), but try to play this game in a 10-vs-10 community server (Like Zomb!e ISLΛNDS, #ЯΛMPAGE, etc.), who have installed plugins from AlliedModders, and you'll see that the game becomes something amazing.			"

!!!BIG FAT WARNING FOR NEWBIES: THIS IS THE MULTIPLAYER GAME AND COMMUNITY IS USUALLY ONE BIG PIECE OF TOXIC SH#T THERE!!!!!!YOU MAY GET ANGRY, SAD AND DEPRESSED INSTEAD OF BEING ENJOYED OR CHILLED AFTER THE MULTIPLAYER GAMEPLAY!!!!!!THEY USUALLY DO NOT WANNA HELP NOOBS NOR EXPERIENCED PLAYERS!!!!!!THEY STALK, INSULT, THREAT, PUBLICLY WISH DEATH, DOWNVOTE AND SPAM!!!!!!FORUM IS TOO OFTEN FULL OF TROLLS, DANGEROUS RUDE ID#OTS AND TROLL-FISHES!!!Pros: The game itself is not so bad and there is a workshop and authoring toolkit. And this is the fastest *glitched* votekicking and insulting simulator I ever saw.And a game joke:- Why headshoots don't work in L4D2?- Because no one L4D2 user has any brain.TL;DR:PUBLIC MULTIPLAYER: TROLLS&ID#OTS, RAGEQUITS, GLITCHERS, THEY TEAMKILL YOU *RIGHT BEFORE* CAMPAIGN ENDS, THEY KICK&BLAME YOU FOR EVERYTHING: LOOSING, LESS HOURS, WINNING(!). HIT/MISS IS A GLITCHABLE PING/LERP-RELATED S##T. QUICKPLAY OFTEN JOINS PAY-TO-WIN/CHEAT/R#PE SERVERS. SINGLE-PLAYER IS BORING AFTER FIRST FINISHED EXPERT! 7+Y.O. GRAPHICS! CAM IS ALWAYS INSIDE SOMEONE!In my opinion you should AVOID Left 4 Dead 2(1) unless it's cost equals to ZERO, because this is the exact amount of joy the public multiplayer will give you!You WILL feel like an overdue sh#t! Check health insurance before buying that game! CatMario is less frustrating than public multi- there!Community says you should NEVER join multiplayer versus modes (versus/realism versus/scavenge) without thousands hours of experience... but you can get good experience as SI ONLY BY PLAYING MULTIPLAYER VERSUS MODES... So this is the classic dead end.This game is 7 years old. You will meet members with 7 years of experience. Many of them simply started to stink or went crazy...My ex-friend offered me L4D1 for free as a legal Steam gift. I refused. I did not wanted to join another community horror.Best part is when 3 players got incapped and you are the only who can help them. You are going to help them, but there is a hunter chasing you, so you fight him first. And you killed him and start running to help them... And THIS is the moment when you will be usually votekicked for not giving an IMPOSSIBLE INSTANT help for 3 d#mb and thankless id##ts... But when you ignore the hunter, try to instantly help them and get catched by hunter, you will be kicked too...Even when you have hundreds/thousands hours of experience and have been playing a long and enjoyable scavenge match with friends in public game, then often 1 or 2 id#ots join your team and start votekicking or TKing you. Public games are the f-g cancer there.You can start your own localhost server and this can protect you somewhat against kicks. But you need a really good Internet connection. Public IP is recommended. Many people leave localhost or sometimes try to DDoS/hack your PC.Summing up, multiplayer community contains:- trolls who will team-kill you and rage;- newbies who rage after the first tiny failure;- toxic pros who will votekick you after the first tiny failure... even if it was their failure...;- toxic id#ots who will kick you for not being a wizard and slave (well... if you are a wizard and slave, you are kicked anyway);- id##ts who will votekick or kill you right before the campaign ends;- enhanced lame-pros on official servers who do wall-hack, bbox-glitch, grab & throw 14455 cans per second and are uncatchable by special infecteds (no, those players will NOT be VAC-banned, they will kick you);- id##ts who join public games and slash all the joy of users playing there just because;- fake-females, catfishes, phishers, game vulnerability exploiters and slowhacking game servers;- strange person who can remember you and DDoS every game server you join for the next year (all players are disconnected during DDoS);- at least one id##t from my country who yells ""kick f-g noobs!"" via mic and kicks EVERYONE!You may be kicked for:- being dead before others;- when someone other was killed before you;- doing everything right while votekicker has no idea why you did what you did;- not helping a person;- helping a person;- going left for 12.4 seconds instead of 12 seconds;- not being a wizard and slave;- not using the mic;- using the mic;- not having >5000 hours of gameplay;- having ping >80ms;- not catching uncatchable player;- not using key binds or scripts;- when they wanna friend instead of you right now;- when votekicker is an id#ot.During sales some trolls set up scavenge servers with unplayable maps for noobs (scavenge with invisible walls, only waste of time).Some toxic ""pros"" join PUBLIC in 2 and kick EVERY other player. Saw it many times.Hit/miss IS ping related.And the VERY BAD thing is that Valve did IMHO a GOOD JOB and made the game WELL with reasonable multiplayer tools. And I am REALLY SAD to make a negative review. I even got the game for free during the event, so I should be happy... Maybe I should be happy, but after 1000+ hours I am unable to recommend this game to newbies... It was my only multiplayer game so I was retrying very often, but on any versus it is usually one big piece of mental horror...Valve even added achievements for people who help newbies, but the community never changes...After 1k hours I wanted to maximize my EXPERT achievements AND I DID IT... by playing SINGLE-PLAYER ALONE WITH THOSE ""BAD"" BOTS... because multiplayer users usually raged, TKed, votekicked or went crazy before the campaign ended (or even started)... and I did this alone successfully without any ill stress, even if it was 4 times harder to complete the map (no rescue closets, bots do NOT carry fuel cans). No cheats/hacks. Some retires needed, but it was doable and enjoyable after finishing!On the contrary, I bought OTHER AAA game and started Team Deadmatch multiplayer after only 15 minutes of experience (including the time of messing with GFX settings). And... no one blamed others for being a noob with rank 1 (they had ranks like 25, 60), no one raged, no one votekicked... And we even won. And it was joyful. I believe something like that is impossible with L4D2.So if you really wanna try L4D2, there are my pro-tips:DO PLAY versus and scavenge after some SOLO (single-player) play. Do NOT stick with solo play - it is the dead end.1. Find someone on public games who is weak (or has little hours) and is NOT a troll/i####t.2. Friend him. 3. Play with him in friends-only game.Repeat 1-3 to make bigger team.When you are voted without a valid reason and without any explanation, then block person who started the votekick.You are welcome.And if you like TR2013 for it's CASUAL/RANKED selector, L4D2 doesn't have it...Read about console commands that improve your security against exploits.Apply security commands BEFORE joining any multiplayer games.If you believe that experienced community help newbies, visit community forum and think again! Can't post links, but did some quotes:Originally posted by JewSlappa:I was kicked. For no reason.At all.I don't know what I did to deserve this...Originally posted by Vietcong Charlie (NVA):I would kick you just for giggles.In fact, I would probably make several alt accounts just kick you for more giggles.Originally posted by Acevy:The community for this game is probably worse than anything else I've ever playedOriginally posted by jari86:Don't like it or the community - get the f##k outta here. ... Eat sh#t and die.Originally posted by Richard:I joined and got kicked a second after.

												Before the original Left 4 Dead came out, I wasn't a big fan of zombies. My spouse bought me the original game and wanted us to play together. I was hooked. I'm a sucker for a good storyline, and the L4D series delivers. The second game centers on a new set of characters. While I wish the group was more balanced along gender lines, it is nice to see POC represented.I have become obsessed with playing zombie games ever since I started playing this series. Now my entire family has their own copies so we can all blast zombies together.			"

												A timeless co-op experience; full of varying types of zombies, weapons and  characters. This game is made by valve so performance issues are practically non-existant, apart from the occasional crash, the optimisation is great.The introduction of the workshop  allows you to play community made maps along with with modifications to the base game, for example: you could turn a gnome into killer keemstar,  KILLER ♥♥♥♥ING KEEMSTAR  or maybe you want to turn your tank into shrek, the sky is the limit. With varying amounts of game modes too, this game has plenty of bang for your buck regardless of if it is on sale or not.If you haven't already got this game, do yourself a favour and click that purchase button.

												Amazing game. A true example of innovation done right in gaming.-Graphics: crisp, clean textues and environments. 720p and up.-Frame Rate: 60fps and up.-Sound: Audio is breathtaking, clear, and optimized.-Gameplay: Incredible. A simple system that's easy for first time players to learn, yet complex to offer late game masters something to calculate with. Balanced enemies, spawn rates, weapons, movements, HP system, and ammo capacity. Can be as challenging, easy, or unforgiving as you want. Well tailored to any and all players.-Level design: Environments are diverse and uniquely pathed to offer a different feel and strategy per level. Spawns and item placements are mostly randomized, yet still manages to make use of every corner of the maps. Direction and pace of play is linear, but never gets old or burdensome.-Multiplayer: Fast connections, great server support, one button in game press to check your signal strength. Local, dedicated, and undedicated server support.-Customization: Near everything can be modded to suit anything you can think up. Textures, sounds, maps, Ai, objectives, text.			"

												I've played Left 4 dead 2 a large amount of hours, and I can say that it never gets boring, the most funny part is playing with a bunch of people you know. The only thing I see as a negative aspect is that the game is very simple, I mean, all you need to do is moving to point A to point B while killing zombies. The workshop compensates every negative aspect of the game, you can download mods called ""mutations"" that improves the game and makes it more enjoyable. So yeah, I recommend it, if you like zombies and shooting you should get this game.			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 - a computer game, a cooperative first-person shooter with elements of survival horror, developed and published by Valve Corporation. The game is a sequel to Left 4 Dead. Pros:  1. Joint survival.  L4D - is the cooperative shooter, in which the emphasis is on the passage of a joint venture with real players, not bots. So enjoy all the gameplay chips in the form of excellent team work, it can only be together with other players.  2. Battle PVP.  In a multiplayer game is fully revealed the potential and the idea of the game.Talent Team infected heap, someone knows how to pour the survivors of vomiting, while others choke the language, well, someone just ♥♥♥♥ing shoot. All the fun in this lies. Under the bot can already tune, but under real players net.Oni can cheat, to negotiate, to use cunning tactics to create unusual ambushes and act outside the box.  3. The atmosphere and realism.  Valve is well tried, the graphics in the game match for her elegant atmosphere. The dark and empty streets, ruined houses, abandoned hospitals and airports, it all looks very good. Immediately evident that the developers have worked all the details.  Minuses:  1. Bored. Maybe if you get bored a lot of play in it.  Conclusion: Left 4 Dead 2 is a game that became for me a great way to forget about your problems and relieve stress by killing zombies. "

												So, it's time to write something about Left 4 Dead 2, I guess.Yes. Yes, I know this review comes late, but who cares, huh?Left 4 Dead 2 was one of the first games I bought on Steam and still remains one of my favourites because of it's diversity and the fun you can have when playing with friends. It's a First-Person-Survival-Shooter where you have to fight your way through various maps and chapters, whilest semi-brutally slaughtering tons and tons of zombies.If you plan to buy this game, make sure your friends do own it too, otherwise you will only have half as much fun as possible.Now on to the game design:The overall design gets a 8/10 from me.The weapons are well rounded, have a game-fitting visual design and are fun to play.The zombies are great. Normal zombies aren't a great threat, if they do not appear in big hordes, like you would expect it. The special infected are tougher, but not impossible to beat and it just overall feels great to fight them.The map design is also fitting for a post-apocalyptic world, it's all in a more grey-ish style and seems rotten and abondoned.The game mechanics:Survival-Slaughter. It's as simple as that. Find basic weapons at the beginning, progress through the linear chapters and fight, fight, fight. I personally would've enjoyed it even more, if the game would've let more opportunities for alternative ways open, or the ways would've been harder to find, but it was okay and I guess I spent more time hindering my friends than actually fighting.The best part about the game is the mod- and Steam-Workshop-support, you can make a completely different game. Your zombies can be Stormtroopers, Aliens or you could even let out your hate of bronies on them! You can add different sounds, weapon skins, maps, character models, everything you can imagine to mod can be modded.So - All-in-all:Gameplay: 8/10Design: 8/10Diversity: 9/10Fun-Factor: 9/10A great game and definately worth checking out. Have fun slaughtering with your friends!			"

Really fun game to play with friends or with new people (I guarantee that new friends will be made, if you're lucky like me you'll meet a zombie-loving old man with 1,000 plus hours on l4d2 and thinks that you're a white person also disguised as an alligator)			"

												Even though it's an old teamwork-oriented game, it still is so much fun to play on and has so many things to do; never gets boring if you have 2-3 friends to play together in versus games. Also, the custom campaigns from the workshop add a boost of entertaining and the scavenge on the rooftop from No Mercy map is very awesome. The plot is simple because all you need to do is to go from a safe house to another killing everything which is in your way. I spent on over 2k hours on and the price is worth it, that's why i highly suggest everyone who's interested in good content should try this.It has its ups and downs. You can basically meet all sorts of people in the community, nicer or less nicer, from where you can choose to play further. This is why it's very competitive. From time to time, you can experience minor bugs but they don't downgrade the experience.In conclusion, I give this game 10/10, one of the best old games out there!			"

												After a while, and after you've run through all the great campaigns, you'll start to just play this game for relaxation because killing zombies kinda becomes soothing and rhythmic. Really fun game to play with friends or with new people (I guarantee that new friends will be made, if you're lucky like me you'll meet a zombie-loving old man with 1,000 plus hours on l4d2 and thinks that you're a white person also disguised as an alligator)			"

												Atrocious community. Ive met several pretty cool people, but Ive also met hundreds of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.The versus mode is the most popular online mode, and its fun, when you can get a balanced game going. This is almost impossible to accomplish, however. Im not sure how many versus games Ive played... maybe 100? Out of those, 2... TWO have been balanced games. Both those times my team lost point wise, but we all won because everyone had lots of fun. The remaining 98 have been total routes for one side the entire match. Even on the winning side, its just not very fun.Also, happen to not play with absolute perfection? You get vote kicked, despite you probably doing better than the other 3 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s your with.Happen TO play with absolute perfection, at least relative to your teammates? You get vote kicked anyway, because the 3 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s want ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ #4 to join their game and your holding up the spot.From what I gather the community has deteriorated over time. I wish I had gotten this when it was new. Unfortunately I didnt even know it had come out.Gameplay wise, the game could use some tweaking. There are several blatantly unbalanced ""quirks"" this game has, that detract from an otherwise balanced experienced. But overall its well done and fun to play.The game alone is enjoyably designed for the most part. Unfortunately this being a co-op centered game, the community brings down the games final rating by several notchs, since the community is integral to this games experience.Possibly recommended when on sale just to give it a try.

												This updated review is directed to those considering buying this game at the time of a sale.If you have not checked my profile, you will see that I have more than 4,800 hours at the time of this review.  There is a good reason for that, I can tell you this game is fun for anyone who wants to shoot zombies/infected.  Unlike other zombie games, You get to actually play as the infected against player-controlled survivors and vice versa.  It is even more fun when playing with friends in against an equally-skilled opposing team. This game features and abundance of assorted games modes and mutations (which are sames modes but with varied tweaks) perfect for just about anyone.  If you are new, go to forums and find some new players such as yourself and add them as your friend.  Play with those friends in the campaign mode to learn the game and its infected.  Practice playing as the infected in Versus Survival mutation mode.BEWARE,  IF YOU JUMP straight into the Versus/Scavenge competitive modes before actually earning experience in a lot of campaign games, you will be met with a somewhat unwelcoming community that will vote kick you.  As with any game, you have to learn the basics before trying to go into the competitive (Versus/Scavenge) modes.  There is a good reason for this (despite the community having a bad reptuation), a infected team will exploit any weakness the other team has: be it a new player with inexperience, a slow-progressing person, or player with incomplete understanding about the game mechanics.  It is the fact that player infected can think tactically and combine their attacks whereas bot-controlled infected in campaign will go attack one-by-one but not all the time.As a new player, the vote kicking feature will seem like your worst enemy and will even turn you off and disregard this game (A lot of silly forum threads because of these reasons).  But after awhile, you will learn that this feature is necessary as it removes AFKs, Griefers (Teamkillers/glitchers), and inexperienced players (sadly).  Remember that there is no rank system in place and therefore you will be placed with veteran players easily in Versus.  Getting dominated quickly is no fun nor is it fun for your teammates.  Strangers in versus will rant on you for single mistake (which is wrong) but one mistake on infected can mean 400 easy points to the opposing survivor team.  Likewise one mistake can mean your entire survivor team falls and unable to aquire points. In campaign you can retry to complete the map but in Versus YOU DON'T.It would be great if you brought over experience from the xbox version of this game. BUT!! keep in mind, the standards of playing ARE MUCH higher here than on xbox.  I played xbox for the longest time before coming to pc, and I noticed one thing.  Survivors can aim a lot better than their xbox equilivents. So in xbox, the infected have the upper hand and are able to do damage even if attacking alone.  But in this PC version, attacking alone as infected will get you killed easily (you will be lucky to get close to a group bunched together).  Xbox only tranfers over: map layouts, item usage, and gameplay mechanics.Unlike Resident Evil games, you will have to work with your teammates to succeed here.  Remember this is a co-operative game, you are playing as normal survivor and NOT some superhuman charater like in Resident Evil or Dead Rising games.  You cannot LONE WOLF it in Competitive modes, (theres a mutation game mode for those kinds of players) As time passed, the game introduced the Workshop. This allows you to customized your game to whatever you want.  Add some mods, character skins, custom music, visuals, whatever. It changes the look of the game to what you want but only you will see it though.  Example: you can change the survivors to anime characters or change the infected look, etc.Finally, remember this game requires communication so I suggest you get a HEADSET or microphone but it is not really neccessary.  Play with friends and take time to learn the game.  Remember your version of ''Fun'' may not be the same as the your teammates so you can't just play the competitive modes and expect your team accept your shortcomings unless they are on your friends list.IGN Quote : ""Ultimately, enjoyment derived from this game depends on you are playing with and how you are playing."".....""this is very social minded game that really plays of human nature...""

												My Review on this game is recommanded since i played it 200+ hours on it and experiencing fun until...Things got worse in the game well not the game's fault its just bad players in the game.Players start blaming other players.Team killing anyhow.Players not helping just abanonding their teammates.Players vote kick anyone anyhow.Thai or others Saying in mic so loud like crazy.Players using all First aid kit from anywhere and saferoom like use all when one of us health bar is red or yellow.If you are having these problems,play with either your friends or singleplayer.Still I do Recommand this game but don't try be bad people out there like trollers and others.Many Types of gamemode likeVersusScavengeRealism Campaign/VersusCampaignSingle PlayerSurvivalThanks to people who comment on my review and i edit afew stuff from them.Kay "

												Most addicting game I've played and mods still somehow keep it sorta fresh. I'd recommend new players play on normal for a while and when that's too easy, advanced, then expert. The worst thing about this game is some of the community and a couple bugs left in the game. You're basically guranateed to be kicked for not being a pro in VS, and the tank (basically a randomly spawning boss) can sometimes throw rocks through things... You will sometimes find bad players, but usually not. About 20% of the community really is horrible, but I think every multiplayer game is like that.If you like co-op games, I think you're gonna love this :)  If you don't play co-op much, be prepared to take care of your team as well as yourself. Don't be selfish with meds.Great game, okay community. Game - 9/10. Community - 7/10Wrote and deleted about 4 reviews for this, and this is likely the final because I'm not angry about the bs from people.			"

												This is one of the greatest and funniest game on steam. You litteraly can make pieces of zombies and have fun at destroying and killing them with many different weapons. You also have cool characters and alot of campaigns to play, plus alot of ways/modes to play which are all very fun! (campaign, survival, versus, etc..). Playing this game alone or with friends in COOP is amazing and it's really a great zombies FPS, easy to play, and with very correct graphics. You have to try it if it's not already done!88 / 100			"

												Short Review: This game is a highly overrated and generic zombie game that, in my eyes, is one of Valve's only failures. Not only does the game itself suck, the community is also quite awful. Go spend your money on some indie games or something.Long Review: Left 4 Dead 2. Although the critics and players rave about this game being one of the best zombie games on the market, it really isn't. Sure, there's lots of different areas to fight through, but they are all just retextured copies of the others. Get weapons, kill zombies, press E, kill zombies, get different weapons, kill zombies, kill more zombies, press E. That is how most of the levels work. There are also the levels where you collect x, bring to y, and hold E. Get weapons, kill zombies, pick up object, run past zombies, hold E. Rinse and repeat until you've beaten the level. Now that we've discussed the single player problems, let's move on to the multiplayer. The community sucks and expects you to know what each weapon is, what it does, and how to use it effectively as well as knowing each level like the back of your hand. You will be kicked if you don't have either 100 hours of play time or are quite skilled in everything I just listed. The game modes where you can play as the infected aren't fun either. The infected are difficult to use and are at a disadvantage when compared to the survivors. The only good thing about this game is the great integration of the Steam Workshop. You can download different music, new weapons textures, new levels, and more. In other words, buy this game if you want to be disappointed. Rating: 4.5/10			"

												My review for Left 4 Dead 2- I can say that this game, is one of the famous pioneer of zombie co-op game. While this is the sequel, but this game complete its predecessor.- Really fun to play with friends.- Can be modded. Definitely good feature here.- The enemies not really that frightening because first, the way they behave are funny, second, you got 3 more friends (or AI) have your back. Be careful though, don't let them swarm your team.- Not only normal zombies, but also unique special zombies with different abilities, and also uncommon normal zombies that have unique traits on them.- Different game mode to play. There's versus mode who can make you the special zombies, and have purpose to prevent the survivor from saving themselves. There's also more game mode like scavenger, survival, realism. You can even add more with mods.- A lot of choices of weapons. Additional melee weapons that makes this game better than its predecessor.8.7/10			"

												If you don't have this game already, and like First Person Shooters... get it. It's sometimes on sale for only a few dollars, and on occasion has even been free for a weekend or Christmas.The best co-op game I've ever played, hands down. I spent nearly a thousand hours playing campaign mode before even dipping a toe into Versus or Scavenge game modes. These (competitive) multiplayer modes are very fun also, but be aware that you will be expected to have mastered the learning curve BEFORE jumping into these - your teammates will expect you to know the game already, and there's virtually no on-the-job training, so to speak. ;)L4D2 includes pretty much all the content of L4D1, and a bunch more besides - 4 new survivors, 3 new Special Infected, 5 new campaigns, new ""uncommon infected"" specific to these new campaigns, and new player-usable items in every category. Plus an add-on workshop to customize your game when it finally starts feeling stale. In terms of play hours per dollar spent, no other game I have EVER played comes close.So if you're wondering whether to get this game? Get it, especially if you can get it on sale. Even if you only play it a bit and put it aside for other things, you'll probably be glad you have it in your library to play with friends occasionally.			"

												A really addictive game, really amazing character and even funnier Zombies, the best thing is the ""Scavange"" mode, a really nice co-op game, it is addictive and if you can find a nice team you can play it for a very long time. But bad news for Indians coz of no official dedicated server :/ Best available is the best option, there might be new server i am not sure of been a while i haven't really played it.			"

												Damn it, no, I can't. Even if I would want, I can't recommend L4D2 over L4D1. I'm gonna skip the community thing as often players are behaving like bunch of idiots even outside of game (vide forums etc.) so I think it doesn't worth any commentary as it won't save this game.Despite having more hours played in sequel, when I bought L4D1 I felt like I'm playing completely different game. In my opinion it's the L4D1 which looks like finished product, more polished, way less glitched and annoying with its gameplay mechanics. Everytime I turn on L4D2 I see idiotic Survivors animations, ugly flying pistols and unbellevable amount of melee weapons and SMGs, like game wanting to say „C'mon, don't pretend to be a hero, just take that axe and run like idiot – I'm gonna kill you anyway during next Crescendo Event if you won't drop your pistols”. I don't say L4D1 is easier – maybe sometimes it is, but I feel that thinking ain't necessary (and even welcome) in L4D2.Someone may say that I'm another L4D1 addict being mad at Valve because of L4D2 and porting older campaigns, but no, I can't be like that since I actually bought L4D1 after buying L4D2 (yes, I was that dumb) and while I feel L4D1 was worth my money, I think I wasted $$$ on L4D2. But I am mad at Valve as I think L4D2 is step back. And the saddest thing is that people moved anyway to then new and fresh game which is now practically as old as L4D1 which I prefer.			"

												If you're looking for a 1 sentence review, Even if this game was $100 or even $150 I would buy it, totally worth it.Without a doubt, the ABSOLUTE BEST coop (& zombie based) game I have ever played, & probably ever will play (probably until L4D3).I compare ALL other coop games to this game.I just keep coming back to L4D2 no matter what, even after years, I just love this game so much! Can't get enough of it.  I can't remember even a second where I wasn't bored with L4D2. This game is like my salvation, always there for me whenever I get bored, always ready to be awesome & fun.And you know the best part? Even if there was only the 5 basic maps, I would still play this game for years on end, it's just that much FUN.  (the game comes with more than 5 campaigns; 5 L4D2 original campaigns, 5 L4D campaigns, 2 cross-over campaigns & 1 Community campaign that was made Official due to it being super awesome)This game in phenominal in the way that you don't mind playing the same campaigns over & over again, every time it's a different experience.  And then of course there's the campaigns in the Workshop, that add so much more to the game & show cool new features too!If you want a game where you can play with friends, shoot zombies, have sht tons of fun, & with a little bit of tactics & smart play mixed in, this is the game you've been waiting for!

												Left 4 Dead perfected the co-op shooter, this expanded on it. The idea of team based-cooperation is thoroughly explored through realism modes that remove crucial aids such as outlines through walls, melee adds depth to the concept of corner camping, and anti-camping enemies make every area a peril.Twice as big as Left 4 Dead, even more when you bring in custom campaigns, the game ensures that the core concepts are given more than their fair share of replayability.Recommended custom campaigns from the Valve-run Left 4 Dead blog, for your convenience!http://media.steampowered.com/apps/l4d2/maps/bloodtracks.vpkhttp://media.steampowered.com/apps/l4d2/maps/ihatemountains2.vpkhttp://media.steampowered.com/apps/l4d2/maps/2evileyes.vpkhttp://media.steampowered.com/apps/l4d2/maps/hauntedforest_v3.vpkhttp://media.steampowered.com/apps/l4d2/maps/detourahead.vpkhttp://media.steampowered.com/apps/l4d2/maps/city17l4d2.vpkhttp://media.steampowered.com/apps/l4d2/maps/suicideblitz2.vpkhttp://media.steampowered.com/apps/l4d2/maps/deathcraft-ii.vpkhttp://media.steampowered.com/apps/l4d2/maps/warcelona.vpkhttp://www.l4dmaps.com/details.php?file=7387 "

												Interested in Zombie killing?  Looking to survive the apocalypse?  This first person shooter game maybe the key to all mankind.  The great thing about this game is the versatility as well as the variety of zombie attacks.  You can go from story line by yourself to with your friends or even with strangers.  There are various levels such as easy, normal, advanced and campaign.  But that's not all.  There are more game modes that will keep you interested!  Fight in multiplayer cooperative games such as survival to see how long you can last.  Best part about it, you never win... you always die!  Go more into depth with the game and become infected with your teammates and attack the other teams in versus or savenge.  What did you say? The game is too easy?  Try it out in realism.  This game mode does not give you help like glowing ammo or items.  They don't even tell you where your friends are.  Like in real life, you have to find where they are for yourself!With Mutations, you have a set of rules or variations of the game you play by... so if you are looking for a harder version of survival... Nightmare may be your answer... Want to shoot all zombies with a M60? No problem! Gibs fest will grant that.All these are fun and dandy, but the game wouldn't be the game that it is without 3rd party server hosts, dedicated and casual players as well as contributors to the steamworkshop where you can add more maps, skins and textures to your game by subscribing to the item so you have the newest updates for those items as well!. :)We long for a LFD3, but as the game continuously grow with players and mods from the workshop things can get quite... Interesting.			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 is the Fps of choice to the gore hounds and the zombies lovers. The game itsef is not much like classic zombies where survival is the top priority, instead its more of a first person shooter, where landing your shots and have sharp senses will many times decide your fate. Getting infected is not a thing as the survivors in this game cannot turn. Zombies are so weak and so fragile, they there simply to slow you down. The real game is between the survivors and the special infected, mutated zombies variants, that use they multiple habilities to kill the survivors, and as they are the only ones that can be controled by humans, its a game of teamwork where the best team wins, in a 4vs4 versus game action. Now the worse part, the commnuity, you will always seem to find yourself stuck in the same situation, in a game with 3 other people in campaign where one of them starts to shoot everyone and leave, or in a versus game where your team joins and leaves, changing faster than you can keep up, while the other team is alwasy the same 4 people, just spamming, bringing up excuses evertime ur attack is sucessfull, and scream at you full force and CAPS LOCK with no regrets every swear word in the english dictionary everytime you survive they combined attack. You will be invited to a lot of Get owned groups and You suck, your mother will get insulted a lot in every language you can possibly imagine, and your teammates leaving you faster than rats in a sinking ship, but if, and only if, you luck out and find yourself great friends, you will enjoy this game for all its worth it.8/10 The best zombie game to play with friends, the worst game to play alone.

												One of the best co-op games out there.Left 4 Dead 2 uses a simple ""zombie"" theme with brand new characters, areas, and new special infected introduced. The graphics have imporved from the first game and the gore have been redesign so it is even more satisfying to shoot the zombies with hell of a lot more blood. There are also new special infected to make the maps more challanging. The new characters are really well designed and their dialogs are hilarous so the player interaction can be extreamly satisfactory if one finds a nice team to play with. This game is a remastered, improved Left 4 Dead. Some of the old game modes remain untoched, however Valve has added new ones like: Scavange, Mutations, and realism versus modes.This game is an imporved Left 4 Dead 1 game. 90/100Note: Don't buy left 4 dead 1 if you own left 4 dead 2. All the maps are included in Left 4 Dead 2.			"

												Love the multiplayer. Singleplayer is a bit difficult due to the terrible AI (who can't even throw molotovs, bile, or pipe bombs), but it is also fun when playing on a lower difficulty. But if you do get this game, get it for the multiplayer. Versus is tons of fun with friends, and I can say the same for the multiplayer campaign modes.  Everynow and then a mutation comes out, and with it, a lot of new fun as you adapt your playstyle to it. The gametypes are all unique, and if you value a good multiplayer experience, I would go and pick this game up.			"

												This game is a pure gem.Want coop? Want versus pvp? Want it to be more realistic (realism)? Want custom/addon content/maps (workshop+downloadable add maps)? Want lots diverse playmodes without sacrificing playability?Even if you don't want all that, there's nothing else that beats the mandatory teamplay, incremental ongoing learning ladder and all the diverse experiences that awaits in this game.Just get it (buy it), even if it's not for sale. Try everything, because all the different playmodes are that good (well thought out, designed and implemented)! Really!This is a game you can both play casually AND play over entire weekends. Just be sure to stretch your legs in between games. This is a game where it's relatively easy to find, create and join online games, and doesn't break the flow during a game unlike many other multiplayer online games.Be warned though: Start on the easier levels first (normal+). You'll learn more and learn enough to be helpful to games at Expert level later. If you get kicked, it's probably because you missed something and annoyed someone. Later, you may become friends with the more experienced players and appreciate the game even more deeply.			"

												Awesome game that I keep coming back to again and again....feels like I have spent more hours playing it that I have actually invested in it.  Almost every time I play it I end up laughing my head off.  It was free Christmas 2013 so maybe it will be given away again...even if you don't OMGZAWMBEEEEZ you'll still love it as it has lots of atmosphere and playability...and zombies :D			"

												Interested in Zombie killing?  Looking to survive the apocalypse?  This first person shooter game maybe the key to all mankind.  The great thing about this game is the versatility as well as the variety of zombie attacks.  You can go from story line by yourself to with your friends or even with strangers.  There are various levels such as easy, normal, advanced and campaign.  But that's not all.  There are more game modes that will keep you interested!  Fight in multiplayer cooperative games such as survival to see how long you can last.  Best part about it, you never win... you always die!  Go more into depth with the game and become infected with your teammates and attack the other teams in versus or savenge.  What did you say? The game is too easy?  Try it out in realism.  This game mode does not give you help like glowing ammo or items.  They don't even tell you where your friends are.  Like in real life, you have to find where they are for yourself!With Mutations, you have a set of rules or variations of the game you play by... so if you are looking for a harder version of survival... Nightmare may be your answer... Want to shoot all zombies with a M60? No problem! Gibs fest will grant that.All these are fun and dandy, but the game wouldn't be the game that it is without 3rd party server hosts, dedicated and casual players as well as contributors to the steamworkshop where you can add more maps, skins and textures to your game by subscribing to the item so you have the newest updates for those items as well!. :)We long for a LFD3, but as the game continuously grow with players and mods from the workshop things can get quite... Interesting.			"

												If you love shooting the hell out of something, this is the game for you. It provides you with hours of fun teaming with up to 4 players. Of course, there are different modes ranging from Easy to Expert. Without Co-operating with other players, it's nearly impossible to complete which is another bonus and a reason to play with your friends! Although the game is years old, it's still entertaining and a good time waster so get this game now!~ C:			"

												First I thought this would just be another one of those zombie games, but then I realized that there is a lot more to it. There are not just zambees but a huge variety of them like, smokers, those monkey zombies, and these chargers who run right into you and have way too much health. This game is fun and I recommend it. This has to be one of my favorite Co op games. The second reason that makes this game so special is that this game requires a lot of teamwork. If someone has low health and they don't have a med kit, you should heal them. Or when people are about to fall from a ledge help them up and when people are lying on the ground, you should try to revive them. The more people you have, the quicker you get the job done. The only negatives to this game is L4D community. If you are AFK for a little bit, they kick you. Another example is that if you're trying to save yourself but this other person is being attacked and is low on health, they hate you for not helping them out. I've had an instance where a guy had to leave and then a new person replaced him. The other player in the game was being whiny and really wanted to kick him because he want the other player back. One of the biggest things that♥♥♥♥♥♥the hell out of me are the players in scavenge. They kick you almost all of the time if you are not helping the team. This is a few of the reasons why I hate Valve. But this rarely bothers me or anyone if you are good at this game. 8/10 And oh god is the Witch creepy!			"

												The impression from 1st L4D was much stronger then from 2nd. 1st was gently scary and it was something new and exciting. 2nd version is an amplification of the first one, its features didn't excel the 1st part. The addition of few new common and special infected, melee weapons and guns and maps was not enough.For example, in movies Terminator 2 excelled Terminator 1. Aliens 2 excelled Alien. Half-life 2 excelled Half-life. But L4D2 didn't excel L4D. Don't like the idea with AI director that fills maps with wondering zombies. Makes all maps similar to each other, there is no difference when playing on one map or another except the layout and environment. Didn't like how the game becomes a chaos with thousands of sounds playing at the same time, when lots of zombies attack you, it becomes annoying. I just turn sound off at such moments. Daytime maps were interesting to try but it turns out that it's not so scary and not so cool as it was in first l4d.Despite these drawbacks, the game is very well made. Greatly optimized for slow PCs. Has nice maps and textures and sounds. Interesting SFX. Modding support. I'm not a zombie fan, but those who like zombie stuff will certainly love this game. I can recommend this game for everyone to try. But as for me I didn't like it.			"

												This is one of the best multiplayer, and possibly the best co-op experience I've had. I get to kill mounds upon mounds of zombies while teamed with my friends or stranger-teammates, and watch the blood fly on a memorable (enough) assortment of maps, all of this while getting to check out some very cool and not-very-experience-changing—but in a good way—mods. The AI also is well-built. Zombies act like they should, and the odd AI teammate can still be useful OR fun to kill! Especially when I'm not lagging, it's always fun to blow away and make a 'realistically violent' movie (if you know what I mean)! *10 burning zombies!* "

												There’s nothing more frustrating than having to depend on a loved one not to do something awful. In normal games you just have to believe in their skill, but Left 4 Dead 2 changes all of that with The Witch. She won’t hurt you if you don’t bother her. You could just walk past her, wave a bit, and be on your way. That is, assuming your friend isn’t a backstabbing pile of filth.You’re playing over Steam (obviously) and chatting like old drinking buddies when your friend suddenly goes quiet. ""No,"" you plead with yourself as you hear the strained breathing of someone about to pull off a devious prank. Your friend's character slowly turns--it’s probably Coach--and raises his gun. The world is quiet. Then in one split second he fires at The Witch and your whole team is dead. The quiet returns, this time accompanied by your once-friend’s crazed laughter. They got you! Man what a jib. Yeah, screw you dude. I'm leaving you to die when I find the chopper.			"

												Ever wondered its time to join the 'zombpocalypse'? Left 4 Dead 2 is the best place for you. Four survivors with an arsenal of weapon ranging from chainsaw to M60 and lots and lots of Infected trying to hunt you down. L4D2 picks up where the first game left off, only with new survivors to hunt and be hunted. The short story of the game is spread through 5 chapters (although it was expanded with DLC campaigns). It is not overtly complicated and deep, but it can be suspected for a game of this nature and fairly this is not the most important part of this game. On normal settings the campaign can be completed around 4 hours or so, if you have access to the DLC campaigns it will extend the fun to 6-7 hours. Amping up the difficulty will increase the challenge and frustration originating from the retries you have to take to complete the chapters. While the story is not the richest out there, the game features some amazing voice over and writing. The characters are funny, witty and believable -- in the world of the game of course.When you (if you at all) breeze through the campaign with bots this is when the real fun begins. Online multiplayer is its name. Simply, this game is meant to be played with other humans. First of all, the AI is not horrible, bud it is bad enough that you will be constantly ripping out your hair while playing the game SP (especially on harder difficulties) Not to mention the Infected AI is much better. Second, the shooting is at its best when you are surrounded with real humans trying to help you survive or chasing you as Infected. Yes, there are game modes (Versus, Scavange, etc.) where you can show your skills as a Spitter, Charger or any type of Special Infected.The challenges will just never end with this game. You can play different MP modes like Versus or the newly introduced Scavange (collecting cans and filling up the generator while the Infected are trying to stop you). Or if you want you can just play the campaigns again with human help. If you are tired you can jump on community servers or try the endless number of easy-to-use mods created for the game by the community.Here we are again. Valve have proved again that they are indeed the masters of Multiplayer Madness. After hits like Counter Strike, Team Fortress we have the upcoming wave of games like the L4D2 series and DotA 2. While the SP mode is not much engaging and falls short of expectations and you may not care about the characters in the end, if you ever want to just jump in and oppose the endless hordes of zombies while having super fun, this is the ultimate and most definite place to start.Rating: 85/100; Replay Value: 5/5; To Beat: 6 hours (SP - with the campaign DLCs); Played on: normal.

Product received for free
												MINIMALISTIC REVIEWPros:- Fast-paced gameplay- Variety of weapons, attachments and bullet customization (eg; fire bullets, frag bullets, etc.).- UI and HUD is simple and understandable.- Story is well-organized and well-relayed (if the players do put attention on the story)- Melee weapons are introduced.- L4D game is combined to this game with a bonus top-rated community map featured on the game.- Variety of zombies and also the special common infected (eg; riot zombie, hazmat zombie).- Epic and challenging map and level designs.- Tutorials are user-friendly.- Features a band that KINDA existed (Midnight Riders!!!! WHOOO!!)- Music blends perfectly on the environment.- New systems have been added to the game that were not available on L4D (eg; witch's critical hit, etc.)- Characters are great and accomodated to the post-apocalyptic scenario.- No DLCs. Just pure fun.- Mods are welcomed (have your own style of the apocalypse).- YOU CAN BE THE INFECTED! Now that is fun.- Can be played with potato PCs.Cons:- Item physics are wobbling and act like light plastic (most especially the gas cans).- AI Survivors were designed to just shoot and pick up items (ammunitions to be specific). They are not designed to interact with certain objects given by the map.- Some weapons that are available at the game files are not accessible in the game (eg; AWP).RATING: 9/10 would shoot alarmed cars again.

												Votekick simulator 2016. The community on this game is complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ It seems like everyone is a ""pro"" on here and if you make the slightest mistake they try to votekick you. The people on here are so stupid I have literally voted to kick some people for no reason at all and 2 of the other teammates would vote yes to kick them. The stupidity and try hardness of the Left 4 Dead 2 online community does not mix well together and it has truly destroyed what used to be a very good game.Recommended? Absolutely not.Please don't waste your money on this game unless you have some sort of strange fetish with being insulted by 12 year olds and 20 year old virgins who stay up all night playing this mess.

												nice zombie game ,but too much nausea players. not only your money but also your valuable time wasted.  Sale seven years ago,with time pass  more and more players discard the ,The remaining players are excluded superiority and explosion new players. Versus mode is the biggest Flaw ,if u still want get it,try Campaign .Versus mode is so unfriendly to you.好的游戏，然而太多sb 。 不光是你的钱 你的宝贵的时间也会一并浪费。发售于7年前的老游戏，玩家不断流失 老玩家排斥新玩家 圈子也越来越小 故步自封 对抗模式是这游戏最大的败笔 导致了游戏满眼优越感爆棚的智障 以及不知天高地厚的xxx 新人如果想入正 推荐3方战役 至少战役比对抗碰见sb坏你心情的几率要低得多 不管你以后怎么样 哪怕你3000小时后最好的朋友 恰恰是你当初快快乐乐打战役时认识的 。最后说一句 这垃圾游戏毁了我2年宝贵的时光			"

												A great game for many to enjoy. Offers so much in the way of classic fps and team play to multiplayer options on various other levels. Mutations is a great addition added to spice up the freshness of the game which I think was a great implementaion. I would have to say that with the sdk anything is possible as well. I have seen numerous client side developments in the past year due to the sdk and the newest feature the workshop. This shop allows many more developers/hobbyists to upload their content to a community for use and review at will. Great game and worth the buy! <3			"

												The most fun online multiplayer/coop FPS game I have ever played, it just never gets old or boring!The zombie apocalypse atmosphere is really well made and realistic and the special zombies add more tension to it. Graphics and soundtrack are great and fitting as well and the whole weapon system (1 big + 1 small or melee one can be carried, plus bombs, whereas the variety is not huge, but big enough) and ability to share medkits amongst the team add more realism to it.Many gaming modes are included too, aside from the standard campaign one, making the game a complete immersive experience.Teamwork is everything in this game if you want to survive, so it is also a good chance to meet new people!

												Left 4 dead 2 is one of the most interactive co-op game I've ever played. This game will appeal to others who are looking for competitive, fun, and intense gameplay. Feel the wrath of hundred and hundred of zombies launching themselves at your throats. Don't stop for one sec for a Smoker to bind you with it's tongue. Don't stay in a open spot for a Hunter to claw you to death. Don't seperate from your teammates, you'll find yourself at the mercy of an Jockey. Zombies aren't your only enemies, watch your feet for acid that burns like no others from the mouth of an Spitter. Zombies are not noticing you? Then bathe in the bile of a Boomer to show a horde of zombies how good you looked......to eat. Narrow areas are the Charger's favorite spot to squash you into pancakes. She may be crying, but once the Witch is startled, you're in for a world of hurt, hope you have health insurance. Rarely appears, the Tank is the boss of zombies. He's one badass that will put your lights out.			"

												What can I say about L4D2 that hasn't already been said. This is the bigger better brother to the hit L4D1 that put zombies on the map. Left 4 Dead 2 is the single game that brought zombies mainstream and allowed hundreds of games to be developed in this genre. Its fast fun FPS action with an whole host of amazing community made mods. Shoot away hundreds of zombies and fight to stay alive for as long as you can. Many game modes to choose from so replay is very high here. A Source engine game that must be in your collection. Played best with 3 friends!			"

												This is one of those classic must own games on steam.The game premise revolves around being able to choose between four characters - and a certain gun set such as machine guns and shotguns. Multiple zombie hoards come attacking you wave after wave and can stop suddenly. Which sets this game apart from other zombie games is there is certain zombie types in this game. One guy as a tongue that stretches out and grabs people, another guy is a big fat blob who goes around puking on people and attracting zombies to them (and when he dies he blows up)! The game is set up as FPS with the player having the ability to heal themselves (while being not able to shoot) or heal their partner. The best game setting for me personally was the ability to play humans vs zombies where you take charge of one of the special zombie types.RATING :  7.65/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability B- Overall  B- "

												Este juego no es como la paja, que al menos divierte jugar solo. Está pensado para jugar con amigos/amigos de amigos o randoms si es que te gusta tratar con completos desconocidos. El tema es que, como todo juego MP de Valve, la community en general es un asco, llena de parásitos que se creen ""pr0"", cuando la realidad es que tienen 5000 horas porque son pobres y un día se les dio la mágica la posibilidad de comprar este juego por, como mucho, 5U$s. Obviamente todo esto previo jugar otras 5000 horas en servers No-Steam, llena de comandos pelotudos y mensajes cuando entrás, seguramente algunos subliminales de corte peronista.El único modo que vale la pena, en mi opinión, es el versus (4vs4), donde está el plus de la competencia. El modo campaña es una ♥♥♥♥♥♥ que consiste en ir de un punto a otro para terminar en un auto/blindado/barco/avión/heli/armario. Y los otros dos están porque había que poner algo, uno es el genérico survival y el otro es simplemente una cagada que ni recuerdo como se llama.Es agradable si te encontrás un grupito de gente copada para jugarlo cada tanto, ya que usualmente te tienen que bancar por más que seas un reverendo hijo de♥♥♥♥♥♥ debido a que casi siempre falta gente y no da jugar con un slot libre porque los bots son como simios con autismo y entonces se desbalancea todo.Si no encontrás al menos 7 entes vivientes o 3 si te gusta la ♥♥♥♥♥♥, recomiendo tener amor propio y jugar a otra cosa, y si sos pobre y no tenés otro juego jugá al TF2 que es F2P y volvete más mogólico pero con la posibilidad de tradear y dejar de serlo.

Somebody in the mic on my team set up a plan and told me to stand around a corner and wait until I see the survivors walk by. As soon as they did, I charged 2 of them right into a lake and the match went down-hill from there.But really, the game is fun and great for people who want to fight waves of the un-dead and the special infected zombies with friends.

												Left 4 Dead 2 is a game where four survivors attempt to survive and escape the zombie horde.If they survive or not, is up to you, and how you play.Left 4 Dead 2 manages to be fast-paced in a genre of slow zombie survivals, but it also still manages to retain the tense and stressful nature of the rest of the zombie games. There is no aim down sights in the game, unless you are using a sniper rifle, similar to the rest of Valve's games. Another thing in line with the rest of Valve's work is the lack of regenerating health. In Left 4 Dead 2, players must use first aid kits in order to heal themselves, with adrenaline shots and painkillers acting as 'temporary' health. Much of your survival depends on how well you utilize your first-aid...Do you save it in case something goes wrong, do you use it on someone else, or do you use it like it's the last chance you'll ever get...? Will you ever find more down the road? These are the questions you'll quickly ask yourself and the rest of your party as you try to make it through.Other than the healing items, there are various other items to keep an eye out for as well. Pipe bombs, molotovs, and even a jar of bile. Pipe bombs draw standard zombies to them with a loud beeping sound and a bright red light. In Left 4 Dead, loud sounds will attract zombies, and the pipe bomb in particular will keep them away from you, and will eventually kill them when it explodes. The molotov is a simple but effective weapon in keeping the horde away, it puts down a field of fire and it burns enemies. The last item is the bile jar. It attracts the horde to anything you throw it at, and they'll stay on it for a while, killing whatever it happens to land on. Even other zombies.The jar is filled with the insides of a boomer, one of the special infected of the game. The special infected of Left 4 Dead 2 are zombies with unique abilities that will prove deadly to survivors, and will require cooperation or a skilled shot to take down. Perhaps both..The Boomer is a large zombie that vomits on survivors. This attracts the horde of generic zombies to attack them. However, if the survivors are not careful in dispatching the boomer, it will explode on death and splatter on the survivors, turning a situation from bad to worse.The Hunter is a fast and agile zombie with a normal body frame, making it slightly harder to distinguish than other special infected when running. However, when it gets into a crouching position, it pounces on survivors and claws them until they die. It can pounce from very high locations to do extra damage, or it can ambush survivors from unexpected places. The Hunter wears a hoodie, and growls when getting ready to attack, screaming loudly when pouncing.The Smoker is a tall zombie that coughs a lot. That's why you don't smoke, because then you'll get lungs like this guy.Anyways, the smoker has long reach, allowing it to pull survivors around, and into dangerous positions. Smokers will try to pull you into a car alarm to draw the horde to you, or they will try to pull you to another special infected so they can try to pick off another survivor, or maybe they'll just pull a survivor off a ledge, either getting them stuck holding it for their life, or forcing the victim to run all the way back to their group.The Tank is a large, massive, and powerful zombie that can kill the entire group if left unchecked. They have huge muscles, which makes them an easy target, but it also represents their strength. One punch from a tank, and you'll fly several feet away from the rest of the survivors, and, on high difficulties, it could even end you in one hit. They can even toss rubble at the survivors, giving them a range option, as well as already being lethal in close quarters.The Jockey is a small zombie, he runs fairly quickly and jumps on survivors, 'riding' them away into danger.The Spitter is a taller type of special infected that spits acid onto survivors, being an effective long range unit that can deny an area to the survivors, or flush them out. Spitters also drop a pool of acid when they die, making them a bit more dangerous to deal with, especially when you are being pressured by a large amount of zombies.The Charger is a large zombie that literally charges survivors. They run at the survivors with full speed and once they pick up a target, they continue running for a while, or until they hit something. This makes them very dangerous in situations where they can thrust you off of a dangerous height, or if there's deep water, because they can sacrifice themselves and take you with them.Now, we've covered all of the special infected, and there's also uncommon infected as well, but I won't go over them here in order to save some space, and they aren't too important anyways.The gunplay in Left 4 Dead 2 is very easy to get used to. From assault rifles, shotguns, pistols, melee weapons, snipers, and even grenade launchers, players should find it simple to point and shoot at zombies. Headshots are obviously more rewarding, as it will kill them zombie faster, and you'll save some ammo too. There are different deployable ammo types as well, which have different properties. High explosive, for example, will explode!In Left 4 Dead 2, there are events in the game where you have to do something very loud in order to progress, but they draw a LOT of attention. These are called 'Crescendo Events'. These actions cause a massive attack from the infected, and require the survivors to defend themselves until the action is completed. Some events are gauntlet styled, which require survivors to run, rather than wait. Zombies will keep spawning in these gauntlet styled events, so it's best to move quickly. Also, at the jukebox, there's a song that plays and it says 'All we wanna do is eat your brains', which will also spawn enemies.When a survivor dies, you can rescue them in closets through the game, or revive them with a defibrillator. However, you can rescue them before that and revive them when they are down. Going down too often without using first aid will result in death, which can be noted when the screen turns grey. Some game modes disable spawning, so it may be suited for super serious players.At the end of every campaign, there is a final chapter, a finale.In the end, survivors hold out until rescue arrives, and this is the last stand for the campaign.Whoever dies here, is dead at the end, and at least one survivor must escape.Being prepared is extremely important here, as it will require determination from all survivors.Occasionally, the finale will also require the survivors run through another 'gauntlet' styled attack, except the finales are far more dangerous than the standard events, featuring more enemies and lots of special infected.I recommend getting the game for CO-OP, it's great at what it does, which is being a great CO-OP experience.For the single players, I honestly have trouble with recommending this game because there simply isn't enough to justify getting it just to play with the AI. The AI is extremely dumb, and they have HORRIBLE reaction times, occasionally letting you take massive amounts of damage before they save you, and not bothering to shoot the special infected, but instead they try to melee them when they are on you, making them waste valuable seconds needed to save your life. There's also not really a real story, other than backstories about the survivors and backstories about the other stuff around you. While some people have grown into the characters of L4D, I personally have not cared about any one of them enough to feel connected with the game itself. The soundtrack is also not really worth mentioning, in my opinion. It has a nice attempt at trying to place a dark feeling, but it's simply average at best. Gameplay also becomes monotonous without friends and workshop content, but you'll get a lot of replayability.			"

												2 Years back, I joined a server as a zombie. I spawned as the special infected zombie known as the Charger, and didn't know how to effectivly play him. Somebody in the mic on my team set up a plan and told me to stand around a corner and wait until I see the survivors walk by. As soon as they did, I charged 2 of them right into a lake and the match went down-hill from there.But really, the game is fun and great for people who want to fight waves of the un-dead and the special infected zombies with friends.

												Left 4 Dead 2. This video game has brought me an adventurous experience.Gameplay: The gameplay is enjoyable. The different game modes are wonderful. The weapons are well-balanced. The zombies are used wisely. In certain situations where you raise an alarm or attempt to escape a specific area, the zombies will run fast and this immerses players in an actual zombie apocalypse. The Special Infected are amazing. Their special abilities can cause players to feel frustrated. However, this motivates players to work together to defeat them. The ability to add mods to the gameplay is absolutely outstanding. You can change your style of play.Setting: The story is well written. It is set in a zombie apocalypse. The characters in the story have a decent backstory although they could have been provided with more character development. With abandoned buildings and highways filled with cars, the maps are designed nicely. Thoughts: The video game feels short and repetitive. More maps and challenges could have been added to the story. After the finale of Dead Center, it would be fun if players could drive the car. A challenge where the players can rescue other isolated survivors could have been used as well. This develops the interaction between the survivors.Verdict: This video game is simply fantastic and worth the money. If you are a fan of zombie apocalypses, this video game is the one for you. Playing the video game by yourself is fun but it is better to play it with friends.			"

												OK, so I was gifted this game after being on the fence for many years about purchasing it, and I'm kicking myself... for not getting it sooner. It is a good single player effort but the multiplayer is almost perfect. The worst thing about this game is the community. But don't let that discourage you. I was lucky enough to find a group of guys and gals who play games for the fun and friendship and don't really care if you aren't a perfect player. The public matches are not so nice but stick with them. I have found that if you just make sure you are a team player and watch each others back or attack together that you will most likely survive a public match. You may not win, but you won't get booted either. "

												Originally only loved watching my brother play this game. When he switched games, I decided to try it out.Now I'm hooked!Graphics are really nice, extremely customizable too.Creepy specials, and hordes that may, or may not, haunt your dreams.The Sound effects bring out the horrifying potential of the game *grin*.Oh, and the versus mode that either gets you LYFAO, or jittery mad. At the end, what hooked me also, was finding new friends, and enjoying the teamwork you develop as you go on with the games.			"

												A classic game by all definitions, bar the one about it being OLD enough to actually qualify as ""classic"".  But let's not be pedantic.     (And let's not hold it against the game that it has one of the single most appallingly unpleasant ""communities"" in gaming history.  Still a great game if you can find remotely polite people to play it with.)Verdict: 10/10.			"

												Left for Dead 2 is an amazing game. With a team of friends or future friends when you do really well the game truly shines. The achievements keep the game interesting. The introduction of special zombies and map design are in a league of their own. The character design is awesome and you truly get a feel for the team as a whole and relate to the situation and their faults and feelings through a great script and voice acting.Versus mode is well done and you get some amazing teamwork happening on both sides. Surprise cluster-F#c<$ when a team pulls off a great combo keep the game fresh on every play through.Achievements are worth chasing and give a real sense of achievement. Map design is awesome. Can't recommend this enough. If you like or want to get into a Co-op shooter then this is up there as one of the best.Last but not least who doesn't love zombies/infected?			"

												First of all: this game is the best Cooperative FPS game you will ever find anywhere. No doubt. But before you actually decide to buy it, you must ask yourself whether you are going to play with random players or a bunch of friends. Make sure to think it through and answer honestly, it's extremely important.Should you decide to play together with your friends: BUY IT! You won't be disappointed in the slightest. This game offers an action packed gameplay, where you try your best to survive the campaign, while tricky and malignant A.I. Director will own you big time.Spawning tank where you least expect it, spawning Jockey to ra*e you should you wander off alone etc. You will find yourself in desperate situations many times, being surrounded by a horde of zombies without ammo, when slightest error means death. You should especially aim for Expert (or Expert Realism) difficulty whenever you feel ready. This way you will go through the truest L4D2 experience. You need reflex, aiming skills, a will to survive and an abillity to make decisions in a fraction of second. But your friends will certainly be there for you. They will share their medications with you, provide a cover with firearm, watch your back or... put a bullet in your back. Friendly fire is certainly here, it's quite an art not to shoot anyone with people running in panic or just changing their position. Crouch a lot so others can shoot above your head and watch your fire. Friendly fire can be even more harmful than few hits from a common infected. If you are not a maniac who loves realism in video games and just look for action packed gameplay with cooperative apporach, there is NO better option than L4D2. Do not play with bots though, they obviously can't handle more than normal difficulty level.Should you decide to play without your friends and just join random players: DO NOT BUY IT!You will fall into despair after playing a round in let's say 80% of lobbies. There will be rookies playing on expert difficulty, people who's never heard of English language and simply can't communicate with you, griefers, people who join the game just to kill you all and then leave, people who waste medications just so you won't have them, those who will incapacitate you numerous time cuz ""you shouldn't get hit, I was aiming above you"", those who will nonchalantly run into your fireline getting incapacitated and telling you to watch your fire etc. VS mode? Ok but you need to understand one very important aspect of it. People will leave immediately when they think they are losing the match and I'm not even joking. You owned the whole opposing team right after start? Well you can be proud, but they will leave the game and the match will end unless someone from your team joins the other one. Best advice would be: show your skills of course but give your enemies at least an impression that they can still win should they try harder. Sounds surreal but you should keep that in mind unless you want your matches to end halfway through.TL;DR: 9.5/10 for the actual game. 0/10 for community. Do not play with randoms, play with your friends.			"

-Quick Review-Left 4 Dead 2 (L4D2) is a zombie/horror First Person Shooter, Left 4 Dead 2 was released in 2009 by Valve. There are thirteen campaigns in Left 4 Dead 2, Six of them are from the original Left 4 Dead Series and have the original survivors/characters.-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  Left 4 Dead 2 takes place on the top of a hotel building to the site of a Helicopter flying away and the survivors cursing their luck at missing their ticket out of this town. You play as one of four survivors: Coach, Ellis, Nick, and Rochelle.Without giving away any details on what are within the campaign, the names of the campaigns in L4D2 are: Dead Center, The Passing, Dark Carnival, Swamp Fever, Hard Rain, and the Parish. +3 downloadable campaigns. Each Campaign has its own dark theme, and sometimes it's very own zombies.Summary: You've survived the zombie apocalypse, oh no! Just kidding! Now you need to fight your way through the hoards of zombies to survive the zombie apocalypse! Fight through the city, demented circus, swamps, and tall grass fields!Game Play: Left 4 Dead 2 controls like any other FPS with the addition of flashlights, and various other weapons you can swap in-game that you find on the ground. The game lets you chose between 20+ guns and 11 melee weapons. There are a number of game modes in Left 4 Dead 2: Campaign, Single Player, Survival, Versus, Realism Versus, Realism, Scavenge, and Mutation. It's difficult to try to explain general concepts behind each game mode, each one has its own quirks or game play, generally there are two types of game modes: Story related, and Player vs Player.Achievements: Left 4 Dead 2 has 70 Achievements, at the time that I'm writing this review (05/15/15) I have 40 of these achievements... most of which are related to the main campaign. The achievements are split between the campaigns and the extra game modes where you need to play against other players.Price: Left 4 Dead 2 is priced at $19.99 for most people this is a very good deal because of the games replay value, and many features, modes, and campaigns. As always, I suggest waiting for a sale, but this is one of the first steam games I ever purchased......Mostly because of the promise of a friend who'd play it with me, and then played it with me once. Thanks, feeling the love. (I don't buy the games he recommends anymore, unless I plan to play by myself. </3  )Conclusion: In my opinion, Left 4 Dead 2 is one of the best zombie games out there. Giving you a large amount of wiggle room to use your favorite weapons regardless of how good they are, different difficulties, and competitive online play if-you-so-desire.I recommend this game to FPS Junkies, regular steam gamer's, and zombie-game-fanatics.

												I would rate this game a 10/10, for it has no co-op zombie game superior.A fantastic game, even in this day and age years after it's original release. The game is strongly being kept alive by various active server communities as well as by the modders and mappers (of which I am one). The community as a whole is rather pass or fail though, in Pub (Public) games you will find all kinds of people, phenominally trolls, team killers, trash talkers, and bad sportsmen; these people alone are the main flaw in what is otherwise a fantastic zombie killing game. This game is easily modded and mapped for, server maintenance is easier than other games like garrysmod (for example) and when you do find friends or friendly people you will have a great time.The gore is 10/10 make sure to set it to HIGH for the full zombie killing effect, blast parts off of those zombies like no tomorrow.The sounds are 10/10, game is well made and the sounds are very definitive, you can use them to identify an infected and where they are.The environments are 10/10, they simply are aesthetically pleasing without being overwhelming.The stock (vanilla) maps (world levels) are numerous and diverse, anything from hospitals to sewers to shopping malls and national forests.The gamemodes are great 10/10:Survival (survive on a clock in a map and go for the gold in increasingly difficult hordes)Mutation (play gamemodes that change the fundaments of the game in unique ways)SingleplayerCo-op (up to 4 people on a stock server)VersusRealism Co-Op (harder co-op, no glows, witches insta kill, etc.)Realism VS (versus with no glows and witches insta kill, etc.)Scavenge (play against the infected and fill up the generator, the more cans the more points)-----The only con is the players you will find, as I said above you will meet the worst of the worst. While hackers are sparse, trolls are not.BUTdont let that discourage you because I have met hundreds of people in L4D2 that I call ""Friend"" and I have found many communities I can call ""Home""			"

												Great game, lots of different game modes like survival, which is similar to black ops zombies, versus, where you play as either a zombie or a survivor, scavenge, where you find cans of gas to fill up a car while fighting away zombies and the best is the campaign, all the levels are really nicely designed and is very fun to play with friends. The workshop is also a great bonus, meaning you can have mods such  custom sound effects, zombies, weapons and custom campaigns and maps. A mod I recommend is the split screen mod, just plug in two controllers and you can play with a friend on one pc. Price drops to less than £4 on sales so can be very good value for money.

												Note: For some reason my play hours for this and the first are waaay lower than they should be.When I heard that there would be a sequel to Left 4 Dead within a year of the original my first thought was, ""Can... can Valve do that? I didn't think they were allowed to do that.""My second thought was, ""How could they possibly make major improvements that couldn't just be new maps?"" I was so wrong to ever doubt the Great and Powerful Oz that is Valve.A female zombie, very forward thinking Valve. She's called the Spitter? One step forward, two steps back.New guns? Awesome. Smash a zombie with a guitar? What guns?New characters that still follow basic stereotypes? Who cares? I don't even remember the names from the first one.They've got new maps, new playmodes, tons of new achievements, and even more replayability. I apologize for ever doubting Valve... but you've proven you can get a sequel out quick and great, soooooooooo...Yeah, never mind. I'm happy with what we've got. I'll keep bashing in skulls with this guitar.Suggestion: Pull a Guitar Hero and add the Bass Guitar into the next game and pretend it's completely different.10/10 would completely deny having startled the witch again			"

												This game promotes highly on teamplays, assisting others as well as communicating with your fellow teammates.There are 2 roles that you can play in this game:* As a human survivor *You will spend just as much time protecting, helping and healing your teammates as the difficulty progresses. Everything from sharing resources to pulling them up off of a ledge. Leaving a teammate behind decreases your chances of survival and running off on your own almost always ends tragically. Hence, you will come to realise that it is fun sticking together and helping one another.  **As a special infected (e.g. Smoker, Boomer, Charger, Jockey, Tank, etc...) [Only in versus mode] **Similar plays are executed from a different perspective. Only when the team that plans and works together as a whole will prevent the survivors from progressing the stage and winning. Attacking alone rarely has much of an effect since you'll get focused as soon as you are spotted, but there are a few opportunities  that allows zombie heroics (like the coveted death charge).This game offers many competitive modes with different difficulty levels of your choice. It also brings teamplay to a whole new level as you challenge higher difficulty as you progress. Worth a shot if you like zombie games! Recommended.			"

												What made Valve think something was wrong with the first Left 4 Dead to make them release this vastly inferior sequel is beyond me.Gone is the fun of blasting through a moderately challenging campaign with friends in favour of annoying enemies that pin you down and an adaptive difficulty level that just throws cheap attacks at the worst of times.Also, mouse lag is incredibly bad in this game, and only this one from my experience.

												Best Zombie game ever, you can use a lot of custom, mods, skins, maps, campaigns, etc. Gameplay if very fun. L4D2 zombies are the best, if you hide from them in a wall or block that a normal zombie can't reach, this won't stop L4D2 zombies because they know parkour and can reach you in any place, such as towers, walls, roof, etc also when they reach you, they won't bite you, they will punch you, once you are lying in the floor, they will kick you, scumbag zombies!!!

Cooperative FPS with Zombies! [KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]You and 3 people have to find your own way to safety by killing THOUSANDS of zombies. These can be ""special"", with abilities that can immobilize a player or so powerful that can defeat all 4 players by themselves, so you have to listen to every sound and keep your eyes always open. There are dozens of weapons that gets upgraded by the time, but you will soon notice that your best chance of surviving is by helping each other (and the game greatly forces you to do this)!Game is divided in ""campaigns"", each one can be completed in 1-2 hours and has different levels of difficulty. The single player story is nice (but don't expect speeches or cinematics: this game has only action) but the game really shines online: it still has dedicated (and populated) servers and it's very easy to join a game. You can play the official campaigns (they also remade the ones from LFD1), custom ones or some nice variations on the gameplay like humans vs zombies.Replay value is high: you will spend countless hours without noticing! And killing lot of zombies in easy mode is a great stress relief!There is really nothing more you can ask, if not another Left for Dead.Best played with Keyboard and MouseRecommended Buy Price < 30$Score 9/10 "

												Gameplay controls are easy to learn and master. Modding the game, downloading new maps, skins, or different game modes is very easy due to Steam Community Workshop. If some aspect of the game becomes dull and unintriguing, you can always find new content on the Steam Workshop.It's fun at first, but over time it starts lacking the same experience as in the beginning if you keep paying the same game modes.  The community isn't the greatest either when it comes to newer players. You automatically receive a nasty comment when you make a mistake. Game would be more fun if other players weren't as discouraging. But, not all players are bad and rude, there are some players that help you out and teach you other things that you might've not already known.I'm putting this review as recommended but my thoughts about this game are mixed and I'd recommend on some aspects but not on other ones. The biggest downside to this game, I think, is the childish Community, but if you're up for it and don't really care about that, it would be a fun game. On the otherhand, if you dislike childish Communities, don't buy this game unless you're going to play with close friends that don't mind you sucking at first or completely carrying the team depending how good you are.

												Once again Valve set the standard for game development! L4D2 is, on the surface, a simple game based upon easy to understand principles and mechanics... however it is a game of outstanding depth and complexity that takes many 1000s of hours play to master. Recomendations for new players. 1) Learn the game in easy/normal coop mode before moving on to higher levels and competitive modes. 2) Try to make friends with players who are of a similar level as yourself, there is no matchmaking in L4D2 but you will have a far more enjoyable time playing with players like yourself. 3) L4D2 is a TEAM game, if you join a random game your actions could very dramatically effect the progression of the game for the other players, a game that may have been going on for a long time before your arrival. Show respect for other players, if you just want to mess about please don't ruin other peoples games at the same time, this is not TF2 or CS casual where you can jump in and out of games without having any effect on other people playing the game. If you are a solo gamer, who always likes doing their own thing, who plays alone and doenst want to think about or worry about other players, then L4D2 is NOT RECOMMENDED FOR YOU!			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 wasn't the kind of game I thought it would be. I suppose I was expecting something along the lines of Dead Island, or Dead Rising, but Left 4 Dead 2 is far from that. It is a survival game, where you rush to get through various area's, collect weapons and healing kits and more, as you fight waves of incoming, increasingly deadly zombies. Some are spitters, some are chargers, almost all of them run directly for you, full sprint, and you must push through to stay alive. Now there are several different ways to play this. I chose a single player game where I was given a team of NPC's to accompany me; However, the campaign mode is a cooperative multiplayer mode, where you play with other players online.  I'm not really a fan of cooperative or competitive multiplayer, so I'm glad Left 4 Dead 2 allowed me to play solo, but there are several other modes available, as well as addon content and more. It's not a bad game, it was actually kind of fun, although I thought it could have been more difficult on the hardest settings. over 130 of my friends have this game so obviously people like it, after playing it for a short time, I can see why.

So if you have the money to buy this then get it now because you are missing out on a great zombie survival co-op game of all time. :) "

												(Review only about the campaign mode since i don't play Versus which also a very good and still played mode).Still one of the best PvE Co-Op games. L4D2 took the formula (and the content) from L4D1 and polished it with a few more special infected and weapons, balancing gameplay to an almost perfect point. Special infected force you to play together with your team and cover each other, while hordes and events keep the adrenaline going. Maps are very well designed and paced, especially the ones from L4D1 which were officially ported to L4D2.The game has a few anoying bugs, especially regarding common infected movement but other than that it's a great game than even today can be addictive, especialy since no other title has managed to improve upon L4D2.It's also one of the few games in recent history that supports mods. All the cosmetic microtansactions you pay for on other games are available here as free mods, which opens the doors to having a completely revamped arsenal, characters, textures and game experience.

												This review is long overdue.One word: Zoey. Man, she is so purdy. OK that was more than one word.Some more words: this game is probably the awesomest co-op I have ever played. And it holds up very well after more than six years. The basic idea is very simple. Four survivors depart from a safe room, slog their way through level after level of regular and ""special"" zombies and reach the next safe room. Do that a few times and after the finale you get rescued by helicopter. If you're lucky that is, and most of the time you're not.Since the levels and characters of the original Left 4 Dead (including Zoey) got ported into L4D2, this game is all you need to fulfill your zombie slaughtering desires. The original levels of the first game are there, and a bunch of new levels. And if you ever get bored of the campaign, you can play Versus mode and BE the ""special"" zombie. If you do it properly you get to barf on people. Now how cool is that! Or maybe you can jump from a building and land on top of Zoey and just ""tear"" into her. But no I could never do that.But the two sets of four survivors from the two games live in separate universes, right? Wrong! They meet, and Ellis declares his everlasting love for Zoey (but is conflicted if he wants to marry her or not, after seeing the bride witch). Now in any decently run fanboy/fangirl universe, the two stick together, live through the end of the apocalypse, settle down and have a bunch of babies. But now I am getting into pathetic levels of fantasies about fictional characters.So to make a long story short. Terrific campaigns with two sets of four survivors. A ""be the zombie"" mode called Versus, Steam Workshop with tons of things you can use to add flavor to the game, and of course Zoey to remind us all that girls are just as badass as boys. Though I will never understand why they added Max Payne as a character with a white suit who always complains about anything Ellis does. If you don't own this, what are you doing on Steam?Summarized in one word: Zoey!			"

												Almost every gamer loves zombie games, L4D2 has the 2nd best story i've experienced (Behind Resident Evil 4) and very colourful characters. Multiplayer is awesome especially with friends you know personally (Or on steam) It's very simple to play so noobs can pick it up easily but takes time to master, it really gives the player that ""It feels good to help and work together"" sensationThe good:Decent storyline and loveable charactersGraphics are pretty goodGameplay is easy to pick up quickly though sometimes ""graphic bugged"" (Actually rigged in favor of bad players)Can be exhilerating to play with friends and help each other surviveA great game for the extroverted type of playerNever the exact same zombie and item spawn locations twice giving the player the unpredicable feeling and great for lifespanThe bad:Trolls on multiplayer that incap you with autoshotties and molotovs when you're trying those expert achievementsRigged in multiplayer in favor of new/bad players so they don't quit playing (Charging through players, ""glitched"" hunter pounces, the AI director spawing less hordes for them, Aimbots that help them get headshots)Bots can be absolute dumb-f*cks since it is a game that plays by the situation and not by the book (Bots ALWAYS play by the book)Mutation mode and single player mode should be more one player friendly and much more beatableSomehow keep ending up playing with noobs all the time or kicked for the most minute reasonsDefinately not a game for loners or hermits as its heavily team-coordinatedModded multiplayer campaigns and VS games can make it extremely unfair in favor of the player(s) hosting itOverall I reccommend it but give it time before you play certain modes and always expect the bad so they'll be no shock or nasty surprises			"

												Overall I think this game is fantastic, the concept and the gameplay are great and with the amount of mods, campaigns, and other addons you can get on the Workshop it truly never gets old or tiring, as long as you're playing the Left 4 Dead 1 portions. The Left 4 Dead 2 characters are very uninteresting, it hardly ever goes into any of their backstories, unlike the Left 4 Dead 1 characters where your hear Bill telling all these stories about Vietnam or Louis about his office. Not only does it not go into their background, the characters don't match their supposed backgrounds either. Coach was supposedly a health teacher, he never talks about it in-game, and I doubt a health teacher would go on and on about how much they love cotton candy, pizza, and cheeseburgers. The Left 4 Dead 2 campaigns themselves, while creative (with the exception of Dead Center) do not have the same amount of replayability as the original's either. Both Dead Center and The Parish are mainly just walking through the streets, Hard Rain you literally go through the same place twice, Swamp Fever's scenery gets pretty boring pretty fast. Dark Carnival is the only campaign I think even comes close to Left 4 Dead 1. None of the Left 4 Dead 2 campaigns are good for Versus either. There aren't many setup spots for the infected, there are hardly any decent rooftops for Smokers to grab Survivors from or for Hunters to jump off, and there is way too much open space for Boomers to be effective. You can tell they really focused the campaigns around the Charger, Spitter, and Jockey. With all the narrow alleys and kill areas near many major sections of the game, it's really paradise for them.While this game definitely does have it strong suits, particularly with the workshop and the new infected, it honestly seems unnecessary. The original game was better than it in almost every way. I only continue to play it because of the mods I have and because it contains the original campaigns. Which is why I do recommend this over the original. It has Left 4 Dead 1's campaigns and characters with some new weapons and infected thrown in. I just suggest staying away from the Left 4 Dead 2 parts.			"

Rank:	7.5/10Recommendation(s):	Play Left 4 Dead 1 first.Major Theme:	Your zombie action movie that you get to be a part of.Bought at Price:	Valve Complete PackValve and multiplayer games. Well, they go together very well. Not sure what really else you want to know.The game mechanics work great, the game has workshop support; it is also well taken care of by Valve and the community.If you have a chance, listen to the developer commentary. It will give you a real look inside the games Valve makes.Most people who have things bad to say about the game say things like: This stuff should have been in Left 4 Dead 1. There's limited maps. Why isn't there this ridiculous zombie type X, Y, ZAnswering those problems… Yes, I'm aware of the controversy around the splitting of games. I know I wouldn't have liked it, but I bought the complete pack after this happened, and long before TF2 became free2play. For me, the split seems to make logical sense. Left 4 Dead 1 was a harder game partly due to the fact of the limited weapons. Left 4 Dead 2 opened the doors on this and added a variety of things. While you can play Left 4 Dead 1 maps in the 2nd game, I still feel the need to play it on the original game, with the original mechanics.Limited maps.. Well it does follow a story, and the maps use a AI director in the background to make changes to maps. In the core, there are about 3 or 4 (if I remember correctly) base maps for each part of a campaign that get used. The director makes changes to spawns and what not on the fly. You probably won't be playing thousands of hours on this title, but expect a good return for your money.Zombie types… This is a big thing with some people. The root of this issue is that there aren’t any binding specs to ""zombies"". Does the mutation/virus/disease effect people, humans, animals? If so, what can happen to each?Valve tries to make the game reasonable, and the mechanics show that. They are well balanced, and don’t require hundreds of hours to perfect.			"

												This is my most played game by far, it has the abillity to be just a fun mess around game or up the difficulty to test your skills. The workshop allows you to mod the game to your hearts content. I do have to say though the community of this game is really competitive and it will be hard to play online without getting kicked unless your ""good"" so watch out for that.			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 is about a group of people trying to escape a zombie apocalypse who meet on the top of a tower. You can do the missions more than once or in different orders, but there is an actual story line, which I find interesting. There are more guns and more options in L4D2 than L4D, even most of the maps from L4D are playable in L4D2. The grapics are great and it runs nicely on my computer. It's a highly addictive game and it'll be hard to put it down. Highly recommended.			"

												This is a....overdue game. Most of L4D2's features should've been in the original. Such as, special ammo, defribillators, a more vast amount of weapons and ofcourse MELEE WEAPONS. My thought is: ""What kind of ZOMBIE GAME, doesnt have SWORDS"". Now, i am not forgetting that this is a ZOMBIE SHOOTER, meaning that there shouldnt even BE Melees and other things and just have gun based items. Special ammo, more vast amount of weapons, etc. i recommend it because it fixes many bugs and you should just buy this instead of the original because it includes the original game's levels and of course there is more things and it's Workshop Supported.

I know that most do not feel that L4D2 met the standards of the original, but it is still worth the dollar in the amount of fun you have. L4D has a fit for good competitive scrimmages at times, but L4D2 definitely fits the pub world if that suits you more. Another game that is worth its dollar.			"

												I've played many hours on both left4 dead1/2 on the xbox so when i saw this on the sale i thought i would love it on pc but..........one of the many things that disgusts me about the Left 4 Dead community is that the majority of them are brainless mongs with a personality of a toilet brush.... ( in retrospect that is actually a compliment)..The lack of understanding is just unbearable.. Irony is easily mistaken for ignorance.... Sarcasm is not understood and the amount of people that don't have a sense of humour.... It's a crime against humanity. I'm not that intolerant but when it comes to certain people i am very intolerant and some people may say well you shouldn't be intolerant but that in itself is intolerance. i would recomend this with friends in which case i would say go and buy an xbox but the second you go online it is an unwarrented hail of ignorant comments about how noobish you are.. but when you retort with something witty and poke fun at how seriously they take the game you suddenly get called a pubecent child and i quote a '7 yr old' and when you then tell them that you in-fact aren't seven and ironicaly call them a 'kid' another hail of ignorant♥♥♥♥♥♥ is thrown at you and when you try to explain irony to them they question the meaning of irony at which point you explain it and give the example you just gave back to them and they kick you from the server................. i would rate this game as worth a buy in the sale but at all costs avoid the online community for fear of actually turning into an undead brainless husk.... thanks for your time love kisses and s*** ect  if you have anymore questions ask me on steam but in all seriousness aviod the community			"

												This is in my opinion a good game.It has relatively good content for value, including content from the previous game, making it a good standalone, while it can be slightly confusing at times, and for high level co-operative multiplayer a mic might be needed to maintain the constant, the versus mode is very enjoyable, as is most of the multiplayer and singleplayer content.Sometimes it has a steep learning curve and other times it's a breeze. Im no professional by any standards at FPS, but i breezed through the first level on singleplayer, i even cleared the whole place out of common infected. Skip forward 1 or two more games and i was with my bot team being charged off a three story walkway in 'Dead Centre' (Mall themed map) instantly losing. That's just how it goes.If you by any chance have it within your steam library from the christmas giveaway  for activation or are considering to buy it, then do so and have fun, even if you are complete beginner.

												One of my all-time favorite games to play. A great co-op experience that is sure to give you laughs with friends, or stress induced, full-concentraton sessions. I highly reccomend this game to anybody who feels that they need a game that can never get old.			"

												This review is long overdue.One word: Zoey. Man, she is so purdy. OK that was more than one word.Some more words: this game is probably the awesomest co-op I have ever played. And it holds up very well after more than six years. The basic idea is very simple. Four survivors depart from a safe room, slog their way through level after level of regular and ""special"" zombies and reach the next safe room. Do that a few times and after the finale you get rescued by helicopter. If you're lucky that is, and most of the time you're not.Since the levels and characters of the original Left 4 Dead (including Zoey) got ported into L4D2, this game is all you need to fulfill your zombie slaughtering desires. The original levels of the first game are there, and a bunch of new levels. And if you ever get bored of the campaign, you can play Versus mode and BE the ""special"" zombie. If you do it properly you get to barf on people. Now how cool is that! Or maybe you can jump from a building and land on top of Zoey and just ""tear"" into her. But no I could never do that.But the two sets of four survivors from the two games live in separate universes, right? Wrong! They meet, and Ellis declares his everlasting love for Zoey (but is conflicted if he wants to marry her or not, after seeing the bride witch). Now in any decently run fanboy/fangirl universe, the two stick together, live through the end of the apocalypse, settle down and have a bunch of babies. But now I am getting into pathetic levels of fantasies about fictional characters.So to make a long story short. Terrific campaigns with two sets of four survivors. A ""be the zombie"" mode called Versus, Steam Workshop with tons of things you can use to add flavor to the game, and of course Zoey to remind us all that girls are just as badass as boys. Though I will never understand why they added Max Payne as a character with a white suit who always complains about anything Ellis does. If you don't own this, what are you doing on Steam?Summarized in one word: Zoey!			"

												Still love this game several years after it came out. Features include 1 man cheeseburger apocalypse, interesting asymetric pvp multiplayer modes (Dev studio seems to have built a whole game on this concept which is coming this year hopefully called Evolve).One other major plus is the Steam workshop intergration, you can get hundreds of mods for the game, maps, new characters, new guns etc all by simply clicking, no external sites no dodgy how do i install, all done for you.

												Left 4 Dead 2 is a movie-like video game that was released in the fall of 2009. It is a game that requires esential teamwork and thinking. You are able to play as four charcters. (Rochelle, Coach, Nick, and Ellis)The main objective of the game is to escape an enormous horde of the undead. (Zombies)There are also seven special type of enemies--Which are the Charger, Jockey, Hunter, Witch, Spitter, Boomer and Tank. This game is very incredible and realistic. I reccomend it for every gamer and horror fanatic.			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 will always be a classic game to play, especially being a sequel to a game that was too, amazing. The introductions from the first game, such as new Special Infected, new weapons and campaigns makes this game a must buy to any gamer. The campaign has the standard maps, which in turn are great, but best played with friends, as the AI are dull in the sense to play with, as they will basically do most of the shooting for you. The Multiplayer aspect to the game, such as Versus will always have people playing and there are plently of servers to play with. A warning though, Versus does get extremly competitive at times and you will want to die inside if you are losing.Pros:- Improved from the original Left 4 Dead- Extremly balanced gameplay- Great level design - Guns and Special Infected improved- Fun for everyone. Single player is fun, Campaign with friends is fun and Multiplayer is fun.Cons:- If you don't have friends then the game can be boring. - AI on singleplayer will do everything for you. (Can be seen as a good thing, but not entirely)- Hard Rain will make you want to cry and die inside. (Like the witches)- Left 4 Dead was known for being dark and more tense with gameplay, which is completly lacking in Left 4 Dead 2. Only in a few areas is there darkness, but instead you walk down streets completly bright. Only in a minority of maps, such as the swamp maps and when it rains is there any kind of fear. Overall, the game is a must buy for everyone. Now that is has been a few years, I do suggest only getting it when it is on sale. Playing the game just for the campaign will get you a few hours played, but if you do get into the versus and the competitive game modes, you will be guarenteed a ton of hours played.			"

												Tactical fps co-op game where mostly everything will revolve around your team strenght and power to overcome sometimes impossible obstacles and get to the safe room.This game will offer you tons and tons of fun. It features a variety of new special infected like the Charger, and you will learn to hate each and every one of them. Every campaign from the 1st game is here and remastered, some of the map layouts are changed to provide a bigger challenge. Few new game modes like realism expert, realism versus, scavenge and mutation mods.New weapon types, addition of melee weapons, finally you can replace those pesky pistols with a katana, or a frying pan, baseball bat, you name it. Guns such as desert eagle, scar, spas shotgun and many more. Quite a lot of achievements too, now listen, if you're a perfectionist, and you want all the achievements in the game, you're out of luck. There's a certain achievement here impossible to achieve without using a 3rd party software.Better and more improved AI. AI in the 1st game was mediocre at best, while in this game, though bots are still dumb, they will stick around you and not wander around the map or get stuck. One of the things that makes these bots dumb is their inabillity of picking up gas cans, which you'll find to be necessary on some parts of the game. It will still take them forever to find you and free you from a special infected.Special infected AI is back and is much more ruthless, remember those bulls*it spawns from the 1st game? In this game, you can literally walk, hear that horde noise, turn back around to see zombies spawning out of mid air. Most of the special infected utilize camping as a way of luring you to the right place so they can devour you. Some maps even have dynamical weather changing. Meaning at one point you can clearly see everything around you, and at the other, rain comes down to totally annihilate your line of sight. Everything thanks to the new AI Director. If you start preforming well in the game's campaign, if you think the game is easy on the highest difficulty setting. In a matter of seconds you'll find you were dead wrong. As he'll release all hell to come down on you and your team.Now, let's talk about the community. People that play campaigns generally consist of 3 categories. Noobs, vets and griefers. Noobs being the people on any difficulty doing some stupid mistakes you would not believe are possible, like shoving a tank. Vets would be generally nice people helping everyone to beat the campaign or leaving no one behind, or be the exact opposite(rushers). And griefers, like in the 1st game, where this form of cancer is present but fading as the 1st game is dying, in this game, there's a lot more of them, from people that join your game just to kill themselves, to people killing your entire team at the end of a finale. So, be careful, when you encounter one of those, block them, or play with friends only.Versus community on the other hand holds the saltiest and most poisonous types of people. They expect nothing but perfection from you and even when you're the best player on your team you will still get kicked because you stepped onto someone's nerves. Or you're just too good. On most servers admins will be id*ots and will boot you if you make one mistake. So, do not approach the versus community unless you're fully certain of your capabilities, and if you can handle yourself when thrown into the belly of a shark.7 years old game still getting updates and who's community is still strong ranging at, at least 3k-5k people playing daily.This game is awesome, challenging, perflectly blended the action and the suspense. Excellent soundtrack, but it took a lighter tone than the 1st game. Anyhow, I'd give this game 9/10. Love it with all my heart. All the fun moments it brought me and all the great people I met in it. Recommended all the way.			"

												Hi there Many of you gamers out there well probably most of you probably have Left4dead2 I have played this game quite a bit and i think it is one of the best smaller first person shooters around. I refered to this as a smaller FPS because there are many bigger titles eg. the Battlefeild and Call of Duty Franchise but this isnt about them now it is it!!. swiftly moving on the control mechanics are quite smooth and easy to learn and get used to if you are new to L4D2. the enemys in this game are a wide array of charecters from a Slow, exploding charecter called a Boomer that attracts other enimies to where ever you are on the map. another Enemy is a fast moving charecter called a charger which does generally what the name suggests runs and charges at you. The maps that are in this game are wide open... most of the time, but sometimes are in really tight spaces for example in the map Dead Centre but ill let you figure it out. the weapons are just the average guns you would expect e.g shotguns and sniper rifles but there are weapons with a twist e.g bile bombs have fun with them. over all i really enjoy this game and i highly recommend this game to everyone. Ps. im spoiling the campaign so have fun :)I rate this game 10/10Thanks for ya time.			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 will always be a classic game to play, especially being a sequel to a game that was too, amazing. The introductions from the first game, such as new Special Infected, new weapons and campaigns makes this game a must buy to any gamer. The campaign has the standard maps, which in turn are great, but best played with friends, as the AI are dull in the sense to play with, as they will basically do most of the shooting for you. The Multiplayer aspect to the game, such as Versus will always have people playing and there are plently of servers to play with. A warning though, Versus does get extremly competitive at times and you will want to die inside if you are losing.Pros:- Improved from the original Left 4 Dead- Extremly balanced gameplay- Great level design - Guns and Special Infected improved- Fun for everyone. Single player is fun, Campaign with friends is fun and Multiplayer is fun.Cons:- If you don't have friends then the game can be boring. - AI on singleplayer will do everything for you. (Can be seen as a good thing, but not entirely)- Hard Rain will make you want to cry and die inside. (Like the witches)- Left 4 Dead was known for being dark and more tense with gameplay, which is completly lacking in Left 4 Dead 2. Only in a few areas is there darkness, but instead you walk down streets completly bright. Only in a minority of maps, such as the swamp maps and when it rains is there any kind of fear. Overall, the game is a must buy for everyone. Now that is has been a few years, I do suggest only getting it when it is on sale. Playing the game just for the campaign will get you a few hours played, but if you do get into the versus and the competitive game modes, you will be guarenteed a ton of hours played.			"

												 This is probably the best zombie-coop game, and this is all made in the source engine as well. This game is one of the major reasons I love valve, the gore is unique and satisfying, the infected all have animations, and the game is fun.  There's also special infected, which are infected that all have different special abilities, and have more hp than the ""common"" infected that you see in hordes, which I like the idea of.Now there's a gamemode called versus, and it's where there are two teams, Survivors and Infected, and you get to play as the infected to stop the survivors from getting to the saferoom. There's alot of other gamemodes as well.Anyways, just get this game. "

												L4d2 + Friends with mics + Hordes of zombies = Loads of fun. This game is very fun, especially if you got friends you can play this with, this game forces you and your team to rely on eachother, you can all stick together and watch eachothers back, or you can run ahead of the group and get killed by a hunter. The storyline of this game isn't bad either, the characters are funny, and the gaming community has produced many mods to add to the fun of this game. The only way you will get tired of this game is when you've played it with your friends long enough to master it.			"

Timeless Zombie ClassicPlug zombies, troll your friends, PVP, or coordinate your badassery. Laughs (or tears) will be had and the community-made mods available can really enhance your game experience. This game easily makes Top 10 Best Co-Op games. Even though it's almost been a decade since it's release, the themes, mechanics, and art direction still hold up to today's standards. Sadly, some of the hilarious game mode servers are no longer active but the vanilla servers can still tide you over into the next generation of gaming.I strongly recommend playing this with friends; pugging is always a mixed bag that I'm no longer a fan of. You'll either have speedrunners, trolls, serious players, FPS newbies, complete jerks, and/or casual players. I've made a lot of memories, good friends, and strengthened friendships playing this game. There's a large selection of game modes and maps to play on, from the campaign to the Versus mode where you get to be a Special zombie. Unfortunately, there is significantly less people playing nowadays but you can still get matched with pugs and/or play with friends.You're not a real zombie fan until you have this title in your library.10/10 - JUNEBUG'S FAVORITES			"

												Unlike most other shooters, Left 4 Dead hinges on cooperative multiplayer. You and three friends must shoot, tear and slash through an unrelenting mass of raging zombies. From the moment you leave the safe house to the final rescue chopper, you are completely dependent on each other and constantly hunted by special boss zombies that behave with their own aggressive, strategizing intelligence. Thanks to Valve’s omniscient “AI Director,” the zombies spawn differently every time, the special infected try alternative attacks, and even weapon drops are changed based on your performance. This makes every single playthrough slightly different, and the resultant strategy to survive much more organic and integral than any other FPS on the market. Just like Street Fighter is much more than mashing on buttons, Left 4 Dead is far more than mindless shooting. Played properly, L4D offers 100+ hours of unrivaled co-op insanity.			"

												Like to shoot zombies? Then it is a game for you. You can play this game in many difficulties to fit your skills, there is also lots of maps, guns, different game modes such as campaign, survival etc. There is alot of strats to beat some part of the maps too, so you can play the same maps more than once without getting bored. In other words, I've never played any other coop game as good as L4D 2 (a game that you actually have to help eachothers, otherwise you will probably die!) I'd suggest to only buy L4D 2 and skip the first one because it contains everything that is in the previous edition in addition of a nice graphic update. 10/10 game.			"

												A wonderfully timeless game with a dedicated community that keeps on creating new and exciting mods and campaigns as well as minor fixes and so so much more. A real gem to play with friends who get just as silly and passionate about slaughtering the populace of a small nation while organising stupid and deadly drinking games.  "

												This is an interesting one, as I play this almost daily with friends, so biases are everywhere.I'd really recommend you buy this game with a four pack and play with friends, as trying to find decent lobbies online is a nightmare, what with the toxic and unforgiving community. Try to avoid playing online with randoms.That being said, playing this with friends is one of the best experiences I've had on PC. A great thing about it is it's abundance of things to do. You have thirteen campaigns right out of the gate, each being quite varied.When you're bored of those, knock the difficulty up to expert and start playing the game seriously while you get instantly incapped by the tank and figure out how to allocate health supplies.When you're bored of that, get four more friends and pit each other against one another in versus, as you try to complete the campaign with others controlling the zombies. Once you're dead, the sides swap and you control the zombies. You can play this on all campaigns.When you're bored of that, you can play scavenge mode. Scavenge is a unique mode similar to versus, but the objective as survivors is to fill up a generator with gas cans scattered across an area. Your opposition is four human-controlled special infected, much like versus. You can only do this on select maps.When you're bored of that, try survival mode. It is exactly what it sounds like: hold out against the infected until you die.When you're bored of that, try the mutations. Mutations are alternate game modes that are variants of the average campaign, scavenge, versus, and survival modes. They will definitely revive your interest in the game.When you're bored of that, start looking at mods and downloadable maps and modes. The good side of the community makes great addons, maps and modes that will blow my mind (After 200 plus hours, I was blown away by some of the modes and maps) And when you're bored of that, the stuff you started out doing will be somehow fun again.Maybe you won't get 200+ hours like I have, or even 100 hours, but I find it hard to believe that a group of friends will not at least for some time, enjoy this game.Rating: ★★★★★ Highly recommended			"

												One of my all-time favorite games, I've spent about 650+ hours in total playing it.If you like the game, the following reasons will probably keep you entertained like me for a long time:My pros:+ well-balanced game mechanics+ great design (graphics, textures, characters and zombies)+ CPU-friendly+ randomly generated action which makes every game mostly unique+ various gamemodes+ endless workshop modification possibilites (soundmods, custom maps, gamemodes, scripts, textures/models and much more)+ basically contains the predecessor Left 4 Dead+ interesting weapons+ useful delevoper console for examining and adjusting your gameMy cons:- it's not easy to find enjoyable public online games (because of trolls, unfriendly people and bad matchmaking algorithms) if you don't have many steam-friends to play with privatly- addons will sometimes clash and make your game crash without a warning, so you have to go through trial and error to find and solve the problem- some game mechanics are a bit glitchy (hitboxes and sounds)- the bots are an impressive accomplishment for the game programmers, but you should rather play without bots if you can since they still are pretty useless in most complex situationsMy rating:9.5 out of 10			"

												Whether players enjoy this game depends on their method of approach towards it. Campaign: On lower difficulties, 8 year olds, rambos and headless chickens get to blast their way through every map unscathed... meh. Decision making skills best tested on Realism Expert, Versus, Realism Versus and / or Scavenge modes where tactical mistakes and friendly fire made by one member can easily punish the remaining 3. That the AI Director creates social experiments out of difficult situations makes every game play dynamic. Definitely one of my all-time favourites.			"

												This game is a really good way to become unbored. Need to murder some zombies endlessly? Then this is your game!There's many different game modes like Survival, campaign, single player and even a really good idea which is 2 times 1 of zombies 1 of humans and the humans have to complete a mission of the campaign and obiously the zombies have to kill them. This game has given me many hours of enjoyment and if you do happen to get bored of the campaign or are bored of surviving then there's plenty of way to fill that and continue playing, like using the workshop, it has many downloadable items to make your characters look different, re-skin the weapons and even has completely new campaings! this game is a really fun and time wasting game, I would recommend! 9/10			"

												注意:以下内容可能引起极大部分初中未毕业的玩家极大的不适。这篇评测是我想到哪里就写到哪里的，可能这篇评测到写到最后已经脱离了主题，可能写到最后已经有评测游戏到评测别的东西。但无论最后结果如何，我都要借着这次新年的机会，给求生之路带来新年新气象的祝福的同时，吐出我心中的想法。那么开始了。——————————————————————————————————如果这款游戏仅仅有单人模式的话，我给满分。但要是可以联机，那么问题就来了。先说个题外话吧。大家对求生之路的认识是缘于何处呢？朋友的介绍？玩家的视频？其他地方的小广告？当然了，了解这款游戏的方式肯定不止以上几点，无论从您从哪里接触的这款游戏，我还是要说，如果您并不是抱着单纯的来玩这个游戏的目的的话，那么我建议您以后不要再玩，或者只玩单人模式！在这里，我想专门把看视频而了解这款游戏的玩家提出来单独说，这些玩家肯定大多数都来自于B站。至于是看了哪个UP主的视频，为了避免不必要的麻烦，我还是不说了，而这些观众的年龄段，我也不想多说了。因为我只是个普通人，既不想被挂到微博里让大家厌恶，也不想以后只能吃流食度日。Steam吧有一个人有一段话说的特别特别的对：“这个...给你个建议吧，没事去AB站，看看各位UP主最近在撸哪些游戏，然后首页哪些游戏出现频率比较高，于是乎你就知道哪些游戏最近别碰了。”仅仅是UP主们的几个视频就能引起如此大的危言来让大家耸听吗？肯定不是，那么问题就出在这些视频的受众群体上面了。在上面我已经说过，这些人的年龄段大家都懂。UP主们的视频确实给这款游戏带来了新鲜血液，但并没有彻底改善他们的素质。这些人就如同墙头草一般，哪个游戏的视频火，那就去玩哪个游戏。MC就是个典型的例子。现在的MC我基本已经不碰了，至少不会和其他人一起玩了。因为这些人实在是太恶心了！并不是因为他们不会玩，如果仅仅是不会玩那么反而还好办了，他们不是爱看视频吗，那些UP主的实力都不错，有一个甚至是以前打过比赛的选手，所以他们只需要看和听，就能掌握这款游戏的基础玩法。但他们不那么做，他们看视频只是看个热闹，玩游戏时也不过脑子，置其他队友的想法于不顾。中国玩家的素质大家都懂，我对此也很愧疚和痛心，但是我一个人的力量是不能挽救的，而且这篇评测写完之后，我人能不能好好的活着还有待考究。所以我在此只能给一条建议：如果你只是喜欢那些UP主的视频而并不是因为喜欢这款游戏才看UP主的视频的话，我建议你不要买这款游戏，不然你自己也是浪费钱，还弄的其他玩家不爽，何必呢？而且我也想给想上传自己视频的有心的玩家或者是有心的UP主一条建议：如果你真的想让这款游戏变好的话，那么请不要上传相关的视频！让这款游戏清者自清就好！所以这款游戏，单人的话，我给满分，多人的话，那就要看玩家的素质与否了。如果你是我在上面说的玩家的话，那么不要买，这是为了你好。——————————————————————————————————时隔半年，再次评测。以前的评测我不会删除。现在这游戏，高冷的，自以为是的脑残满大街都是。这游戏快完了。我坚持了半年，但我觉得我坚持不下去了。如果你觉得我遇到的脑残是个例的话，那我只能说，你遇到的正常玩家也是个例。			"

												It's a yes/no review.From left 4 dead the orginial back in 2008, I loved how dark and complicated some of maps were. I loved the Sacrafice, and the orginal maps (not so much Crash Course though.)When Left 4 dead 2 came out, I expected the same gloominess and terror in each map, but with some of the maps, I didn't feel it. I appreciate Hard Rain, which was pretty cool. But some of the maps were not scary, or just too bright with the sunlight and what not.I liked the original dark setting, which kind of changed the way I felt about playing Left 4 dead 2.The game is good, but number one will always be my favorite.

												One of my all-time favorite games, I've spent about 650+ hours in total playing it.If you like the game, the following reasons will probably keep you entertained like me for a long time:My pros:+ well-balanced game mechanics+ great design (graphics, textures, characters and zombies)+ CPU-friendly+ randomly generated action which makes every game mostly unique+ various gamemodes+ endless workshop modification possibilites (soundmods, custom maps, gamemodes, scripts, textures/models and much more)+ basically contains the predecessor Left 4 Dead+ interesting weapons+ useful delevoper console for examining and adjusting your gameMy cons:- it's not easy to find enjoyable public online games (because of trolls, unfriendly people and bad matchmaking algorithms) if you don't have many steam-friends to play with privatly- addons will sometimes clash and make your game crash without a warning, so you have to go through trial and error to find and solve the problem- some game mechanics are a bit glitchy (hitboxes and sounds)- the bots are an impressive accomplishment for the game programmers, but you should rather play without bots if you can since they still are pretty useless in most complex situationsMy rating:9.5 out of 10			"

												As if Left 4 Dead wasn't good enough, Valve had to come along and make it better. New special infected, melee weapons,  more maps, new characters, and a crazy number of game modes! Plus all the original content! So many hours of entertainment from a single game--the value is simply priceless. And never has Valve asked me to put more money up for any additional content. This is why Valve thrives and DLC hungry companies fail. Because they actually put their customer base first instead of their shareholders. They look beyond the wallet and provide a better overall experience to the consumer.			"

												Данную игру я приобрел совсем недавно, однако на первых часах гейм-плея я уже понял, что игровое время которое я здесь проведу будет восхитительным. Игра имеет множество игровых режимов, каждый из которых по своему затягивает. Вдобавок геймплей, который попросту не надоедает. Засчет огромного количества персонажей и оружия, я готов часами играть в данный шедевер.10 Танков из 10! Билл умрет :(  "

												Se o jogador estava procurando um FPS de zoombies, desafios, coop e diversão, este é o jogo ideal! Além de rodar até em PC do Show do Milhão e seus Frames Insanos é uma ótima pedida para se divertir com o mesmo. Jogue até 4 jogadores com muitos e desafiadores modos como conteúdo extra, lidere um grupo, sobreviva, procure abrigo e suprimentos, proteja, ajude! ""O coop desse game é incrível :D""			"

												To start off, I must admit I'm a big fan of the Valve studio, simply because they will release titles that just can't seem to dissapoint. Counterstrike, Portal, Team Fortress, Half life and so on are examples of titles that just bring pleasure, and any lacks they have will be forfeit due to the low prices they offer for their titles.Left 4 Dead is no exception. They combined the lust of the player to shoot as many walking (un)dead people as they can with the ammunition they can find with simple, but nice gameplay. One of it's strong elements is the familiarity of this gameplay. I found a couple of Zombie Survival games quite complicated, which will be frustrating during the game instead of helpfull and fun to pick up.The multiplayer functions are quite the same as singleplayer (though you'll find teammates definately less helpfull when playing online), with a couple of different gamemodes (only storyline is available for offline).They also knew how to combine teamplay into this. If the other people from your team do not live up to what's expected in that difficulty, you WILL not succeed. Please note that I'm not saying this game is therefore a realistic one, it's still shooting hordes of zombies. But a little surfival is always nice next to the ''spray an burn'' of an average zombie shooter.Anyway, Left 4 Dead 2 is a great multiplayer game and definately lives up to it's predecessor Left 4 Dead. I give it a 9/10!			"

												A very decent co-op game to play both with friends and with strangers. The game has a very enjoyable gameplay, great graphics and good enough sounds. It is very arcade though, so whether you'll like it depends on how much you like arcade shooters. Many game modes and quite a lot of maps make sure you won't get bored too quickly. While L4D2 is quite bland in singleplayer, it is definitely worth getting for multiplayer.			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 is the return to the zombie infested streets but is it a game you will want to slash through ? Im just gonna go out loud and say it if by the time youre reading this review and havent played or own L4D2 you need to get this game right now. Left 4 dead 2 is a simple game where four Charecters Coach, Ellis, Nick and Rochelle are trying to survive the zombie apocalypse. The game is tons of fun and will almost never get boring and plus as a bonus to already 5 great campaings it also adds all the campaings from the first L4D and remasters them and plus all the dlc campaings for aboslutly free. Now like with every game it has small issues that ruin the game. The shooting mechanics arent always the best and the hit detection works when it wants to. The melee weapons are a fun way of disposing of Zombies but when it comes to melee weapons its best to choose a sharp weapon instead of a blunt one. Overall the game is awesome and you just need to own this tile with some small issues its a great time and even better with friends i give Left 4 Dead 2  9.5/10			"

												I used to love this game but I got tired of dealing with all the griefers and kickers.Instead of working as a team you have to deal with all your teammates ganging up on you. You'll get kicked for missing a death charge or not booming all 4 survivors, and if you're new you'll have to deal with some pervert going on your profile and saying (hey this guy has less then a 100 hours kick the noob).And even if you're just gonna play the campaing, someone will join and shoot you and your friend and then his friend will join and he'll get his friend to help kick you.If you want to get this game then go for it, but if you do you're gonna have to deal with people like that			"

												Here is Left 4 Dead 2, the sequel of Left 4 Dead (which I have also reviewed :)"" I'm gonna do it the same stuff but I'll add ratings.Atomosphere: The atomosphere in L4D2 is somewhat less gritty and horror like. It's turned into an action/adventure instead of a horror like game. Thought I'm not complaining because it's L4D, and I like them both c: 7/10Overall score: 7/10Characters: Nick- The somewhat of a second-in-command in the group, a deadpan, snarky gambler who probably isn't from the South, but out of bad luck, less or more, has ended up there because of the zombie apocalypse. He is rather attractive for a game character but I rarely, if ever play him by choice. I rate him 6/10.Coach- Coach is the most supportive member of the L4D2 crew. He seems to enjoy football, Gibby Jr. and Midnight Riders. He seems to get along with Ellis and Rochelle. He is pretty cool, don't really pay much attention to him though. I rate him 5/10.Ellis- Ellis is a ""adorkable"" hillbilly who has the same interests as Coach, and is a mechanic. He also plays bass guitar! Ellis has a bunch of stories about his time with his buddy Keith, usually starting with, ""This one time"". I rate him 10/10. He is my favorite character.Rochelle- Probably the most hated character in gaming history, or Valve games for that matter. But I think she is rather boring, but the second to most supportive character in L4D2. She is also a reporter and a fan of electronic band Depeche Mode. I rate her 4/10.Overall score: 7/10Special Infected: (These will not get ratings)The Jockey: This small infected jumps on your head and claws at your face. People think it's humping you, IT REALLY ISN'T.He has an annoying maniacal laugh and I ♥♥♥♥ING HATE THIS THING.The Charger: This large infected runs into you and tries to separate you from the other survivors to smash the hell out og you. His right arm is his main weapon, he grabs survivors and hits them with it too. His left arm doesn't do anything but flap with every movement. People say it's cause he masturbates a lot. (Which is actually not funny k.) I believe that his left arm was not operating correctly, he had a muscle not working in it causing the infection to spread on the right side, or all the nutrients he had were separated to the right side. There is many theories but let's just say CAUSE HE DOES.The Spitter: This medium but somewhat tall infected spits corrosive acid at the survivors in attempt to damage them, not kill. She has a sagging stomach, sagging breasts and a pink thong. Ew. Her reason for her method of attack seems rather more scientific, but I wouldn't know how to describe it in the best words. x.x Sorry.Campaigns: There are a bit more campaigns in L4D2 compared to L4D.Dead CenterThe ParishSwamp FeverHard RainDark Carnival, andThe PassingMy personal favorite campaigns are The Parish and Hard Rain.Overall:Left 4 Dead 2 is a great game for people who like teamwork, action, survival, strategy and simply zombie killing.Have fun! :) "

												Just your average Zombie Apocalypse vidja game that allows four people to play with each other at once. I really recommend this game to any age, that is if you aren't afraid of zombies ;). Though seriously, Left 4 Dead 2 is about the easiest game to run, in my opinion. Its worth the $20, but if you get it on sale like I did, It's even more worth it! I love the multiplayer most! I mostly play Versus, but I play Campaign every now and then. I have a couple of friends and we usually do Left 4 Dead 2 Nights every Friday night. Anyways, BUY THIS MOFO GAME! 10/10 HANDS DOWN!			"

												This game could have been a lot of fun on top of being an excellent coop shooter. However, (in my experience) most of the online players are either dirtbags or elitists that will not only insult you because you are new to the game, but will also kick you instead of trying to be helpful which ultimately destroyed my experience.If you are looking for a good coop shooter, I would recommend looking into Killing Floor. It is fun, challenging as hell and playing online is a MUCH more enjoyable experience than this fly infested turd.			"

												+ Great game idea, good graphics engine (works even on a toaster).- Sloppy game/server logics coding.I could moan about LOADS of stuff in this game, it would be as fat as a bible, but i'l try to make it short.# This is the most unfriendly game to newbies.I played it for 2k hours, so I went all the way from newb to skilled player through kicks and humiliation, and guess what you get at the end ? You become the one who kicks and humiliates. This is just stupid.Your teammates affect your score and success directly. Newbie teammates could lead entire team straight into the grave and make you scream and rage at them for stupidity, so you are forced to kick new players.This is a bad game design, your teammates should only be able to boost your score, not completely ruin it.Great examples which doesn't have those issues are TF2 or even CS. They might have a little bit of that, but it's not as bad as in Left4Dead.# Low ping in this game is crucial. On 5-15 ms it's all good and intuitive, but on 150-200+ ms you have to compensate the ping time yourself for everything but bullets, so playing it on high ping is 3x harder. Try to jockey the player who's running away from you on 200+ ping and you'll get what i mean. It just doesn't work.# Modded servers are a crime against your own game.# Matchmaking is poor. Skilled players should match with other skilled players, while newbs should go with other newbs, but this just ain't happening. It's always very hard to find decent opponents and teammates that match your skill level.# Game logics is full of bugs to the point where it can't get any worse. Any kind of bugs, you name it - they have it.			"

												Ahhh Where do i start....I got this game for really cheap, 4$ to be exact, on a random weekend sale.I know, not everyone is going to respect my opinion, since i ""Just got 30 hrs"" in this game.I loved this game, i was so hyped for getting it downloaded the second i bought it. At the time this was the game i needed in my life. But that opinion quickly changed...So.. This game is supposed to be casual, it just has some fun gamemodes, no ranked, no competitive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.But, there are still (80% of players) people that take this game way too ♥♥♥♥ing seriously.Like, there is nothing wrong if you want to be good, or you just wanna win, but here's where the problem starts:IF you call out teammates for being bad, and not even giving them a chance to improve (Calling a vote to kick, and ofc everyone votes ♥♥♥♥ing yes.) that is a scummy thing to do.IF you're being butthurt in the chat while you're playing a CASUAL game, you are an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!And so much more...Here, this is my story: I Was never particularly good at fps games, but I enjoy a lot of them.This game is one of them, BUT as I said I'm not good.(I miss a lot, I'm not very good at controlling recoil, and I have a poor eyesight.) And, today i tried to play 4 times:1. I was bad with ♥♥♥♥ing boomer, i got kicked.2. Someone overreacted to something i did, and i called him out.3. I couldn't help my teammates up 1 round, and we lost that one.4. I was in realism, and I couldn't help my teammate, and i got captured by a jockey, so we lost that ONE ROUND.I literally couldn't play 1 ♥♥♥♥ing game without getting kicked for not being MLG PRO.If you couldn't tell, I'm ♥♥♥♥ing mad, just reviewing my experience with this game.I Loved this game, and I still want to, but these people just drag me away.But... If after all this, you think you can handle these butthurt pieces of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I can recommend the game for you because, as i said, its fun. It's probably the best Zombie themed games out there. Plus with addons, you can make it seem like a completely different game, which I find very good, and it pumps up the fun.So in conclusion, This game is very good, but people playing it will drag most people away from playing it more.So... Who should buy this game? Hardly trigerred people with nerves made out of rope. Pro Cod zombies players. No-life ♥♥♥♥.However... I won't stop you from buying it, just keep this in mind...			"

												The elitist community drove away all potential new players and eventully ran themselves out. The game for a time was great but has sadly ran its course too early thanks to the frankly crappy community this game has spawned. You can't even join a  lobby without being booted, you can't even stay in a game longer than ten minutes before being votekicked for the worst offense of all; ""Trying to get into the game"". The only way you can even be considered eligible to stay longer than 10 mins in a game is if you are a professional or a girl the fedora tipping elitist idiots think they have a chance with after recently booting someone for trying to have fun. If you like the game, good for you, but it goes without saying the game has long since died, killed by its own community.			"

												This game is fun and all, but its near impossible to play online as you will get kicked for simply being overrun with zombies.  I was just kick from 3 games in a row.  Twice for no reason at all, and the third because my team left me.  This votekick system should be revised or replaced with an autokick system for AFKers.  I may be bad at the game and I admit that, but the fact that that keeps me from playing online is just absurd.  I believe the votekick system is severely abused.			"

												I'll have over 2000 hours in this game by the time you read this.  If that isn't endorsement enough...It's not even a game about zombies, really.  Assuming you've played a shooter before, it's a game about timing, and communication with your three teammates.  Accordingly, playing with friends, and microphones, is a must to minimize frustration.The game is fine tuned so that, if you are to be successful, you WILL care about your teammates.  You WILL cover them, and save them whenever possible.  In Versus mode, you WILL be scared of open pits and windows, and you WILL treat other hazards like spit, alarmed cars, and witches with respect.  There are a zillion different ways to play, between campaign/versus/scavenge/survival, realism mode, mutations, mods, and self-imposed house rules.TL;DR: Some people have played World of Warcraft with their friends every night for years.  Left 4 Dead 2 is my WoW.			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 is like one of those arcade games where you shoot zombies. You can select your campaign, or ""map"", and each one lasts from 30 to 90 minutes. Guns and other items randomly spawn around the map. There are also ""ammo piles"", which are basically infinite sources of ammo for your guns that you can find. There are also medpacks and other HP items that you can use. Furthermore, upgrades for your guns, like temporary fire ammo or laser sights, spawn in certain areas. Now do you get what I mean by ""arcade-like""?Personally, I loved this game when I got into it. I played the first four campaigns on my first day playing this, and adored them all. My favorite part of this game is how the levels look and are layed out. I don't want to spoil anything, but some of them are pretty creative.Every couple of minutes you'll probably encounter a ""Special Infected"", or a zombie that has an ability that can screw you over in two seconds. Some can pounce on you and start ripping you to shreds, while others cover you in vomit that blinds you and makes you a zombie magnet for a while. However, there is one Special Infected that has a unique ability from the others, which I won't spoil.However, as much as I loved this game when I first played it, there are some downsides. After a few campaigns shooting zombies gets repetitive. Most of this game is just ""shoot the zombie"" and ""shoot the other zombie"" as you make your way through maps. Although Special Infected make it a bit more interesting, I would like to see more variety in enemies if they make a third game. However, seeing and exploring the maps is still fun, along with playing with friends and sometimes online (The community isn't exactly the best I've seen).Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes exploring, or arcade-like zombie shooters. Although it does get repetitive fast, there are things that encourage you to play like co-op and other game modes. Plus there's Steaam Workshop for this game, so you can download user-created campaigns or change your flashlight to an image of Shrek.			"

												The game itself is fantastic, but the community on the other hand is garbage. People will kick you for any tiny reason, such as, but not limited to:Not having more than 100 hours in game.Not reviving a teammate wihin 2 seconds of them being incaped.Not saving a teammate within 2 seconds of them being pounced/snagged/Jockeyed/charged.Disturbing the witch.Going ahead of your team.Lagging behind your team.Not sharing pain pills/adrenaline even though you need it more.Not healing a teammate with your health kit even though you need it more.Accidental friendly fire.Stealing someone else's kill. Not vomiting on all four survivors as a Boomer.Missing a spit attack as a Spitter.Accidentally missing a charge.Not incapping any/all survivors in one life as a Tank.Do not get me wrong, I absolutely love this game and I would reccomend it to anyone (it also has a Steam Workshop that's better than GMod's.), but tl;dr, stick with Single Player, or if you're going to play online, you'd better invite some friends, cuz finding a server with decent randoms is harder than Expert difficulty.

												One of the best co-op games I have ever played. Some people say that this game is linear (what games don't have linearity?). While it is true, the extensive modding community add so many unique characters, maps, weapons, and tactical situations that the linearity completely disappears, leaving behind a hectic battle for survival. You have multiple modes of gameplay. You can either fend for yourself in single player with bot helpers, go through a map with friends in campaign, or fight as infected in Versus and Scavenge. The difficulty modes add a lot of variety, as well. Expert requires the FPS skills of a Call Of Duty or Counter-Strike veteran and the teamwork of life-long friends. It's never tiring to go through any map, because there's so many ways to go through it and so many different situations. The events that happen because of it creates a lot of laughs and a lot of inspiring frustration. It can only get better from here as Valve releases sequels.			"

												If you want a good game with a♥♥♥♥♥♥community this game is for you! Just going to straight up say that because that is the literal fact here. Sure this game is really good, but the public community just ruins it, very usually. Occasionally there are SOME decent people on this game, but much more usually jerks are. If you plan on buying this game I very highly reccomend usually playing with just friends.On another note, if you EVER play expert and see someone new start a random vote for no reason immediately shoot them down. It is insanely likely they are a greifer aiming to make it so you can't kick vote them. Downed player's pistols don't hurt team mates so they really cant do anything except think angry thoughts at you while they're on the ground. But back to the point, yes I reccomend this game, it truly is a masterpeice if you get past its♥♥♥♥♥♥community.9/10, losing 2 for♥♥♥♥♥♥community. If not for that 11/10.			"

												Even though this was made back in 2009, it's fun to pick up a controller (or mouse) and play because the campaigns don't get repetitive unless you play the same one over and over. It also has all the L4D maps ported over but now includes melee weapons and the new Specials, so the old maps are great too. I got this in late 2012 and play it pretty much every day. Definitely worth picking up.			"

												A weird fps where the only game mode is DM. You spawn in a very small room with 3 other strangers called the ""safehouse"". Each safehouse is different in size and weapon spawn. Once the game starts it's a free for all to get the guns and blast eachother away. Here's the really cool thing about this game, you can get a killstreak by opening a door (there's one in every safehose) and letting these zombies and crazy monsters in the room to help you fight. Positive:- Really fun gameplay- Unlimited ammo- Multiplayer only (for some reason single player doesnt work, the bots dont fight)- A few maps have verticality (a bed, sink, ect)Negative:- Really small safehouse maps- The monsters should fight for whoever opens the door (please fix)- Not that many weapons- No customized classes or xp			"

												What I can easily say about this game, DAMN it never gets old. The old fasioned ""Work together or die"" aspect is retro enough for an oldies gamer, but the feel of the game is new enough that any of our current generation players could enjoy it. Personally, people who buy this game just for the Frying Pan and Ellis' Hat in Team Fortress 2, you don't know what your missing. If you're wanting a game to relax and enjoy, simply Solo campaign with AI Special Infected is just for you...but if you're wanting that competitive feel, Versus is great. You can take Arena-like Scavenge, or even play the campaigns in a competitive format of Versus, where the Infected human players work to stop you AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Your goal? Get farther than the other team in the campaign.This variety in the game, of both co-op and competitive, is what makes me come back. Even after several campaign playthroughs of both L4D1 and L4D2, if one gets boring I would switch to a competitive gamemode to see the game from another aspect. Truly, indeed worth the ten bucks paid during a sale (lol). WARNING: Competitive gamemodes most enjoyable with knowledge and understanding of the game. Understanding, not just game mechanics and items, but how to operate the infected. Have fun playing Charger and taking people off cliffs, rooftops, or docks and killing them instantly!			"

Tl;DRAmazing game that caters to both casual and competitive players as long as you stay in your own lane. If you only want fun, stay away from versus, or atleast play it with friends only. Has plenty of replay value and quality content that's worth the money, especially on sales when it goes down to $4.99. Be prepared to deal with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ people. Don't take it too seriously! More in depth below.So by now you've probably heard a good amount of what the game is like, and having played it for so long, I know what's accurate and what's not and so I'll try to condense all of it here, though before saying anything else, I'd overall recommend it despite the many negative aspects of the game. The goodL4D2 is a wonderfully innovative game full of humor, fun and addicting gameplay, and detail. The game does a very good job of centering the game around good teamwork and taking an entirely new concept I've never seen in any other game. I'm absolutely in love with it. Though despite this, it's also a huge part of what can make the game incredibly frustrating, i.e. your teammates are really bad and you die/lose all your health because of this etc. Regardless this game is incredibly fun and gives you so much replay value that you just may never tire of it, the steam workshop being a major contributor to this, giving you tons of new content ranging from gun remodels to entire new campaigns and game modes. If you have some friends are interested in this type of game in general, I'd definitely recommend it to you.Now here comes the community aspect of the game, the main thing everyone talks about. I am talking about VERSUS in particulr here. Is it bad? Yes. Does it make it unplayable? No. Do you need some tolerance/patience? Yes. There are definitely a fair share of utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s out there that play this game, though most of the reviews I see on here blow this out of proportion for the wrong reasons or aren't accurate. Some people will kick you because theyre ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, some will kick you because they just don't want noobs on their team, some kick you just because they want to make room for friends. For the last 2 of these reasons, the main thing that stems from this is the fact THAT MANY PEOPLE DON'T LISTEN IN THIS GAME. You have people repeatedly giving instructions over their mic or in game chat telling someone to do something simple and in a nice way, and a huge portion of people, for whatever reason, just DON'T LISTEN. This is a very frustrating thing to deal with considering this game requires a fair deal of communication, as do most cooperative games. So as a result of this, many people are kick happy. Even if you do listen, you're probably going to be kicked at some point anyway; not that I personally do this. Basically, you have to be willing to communicate and learn the game. Understand that if you get kicked for something that is seemingly for nothing, IT'S PROBABLY WITHIN REASON. Others tht have written reviews for the game complaining about being kicked over ""nothing"" skill related probably have it in their head that their way is the only way. Having so many hours, I'd definitely know.That's versus. In campaign, it's really not that bad. For the most part you can simply play along with whatever you want and not worry that much about people harassing you or trolling or whatever it is, though you'll still encounter this sometimes anyway. If you're a casual player looking for fun then I would definitely stick to campaign, probably play with friends, whatever. If you wanna really get into versus, then I'd play campaign for a while first to learn how the game works, and then move onto versus. There's a lot to learn to this and I'll tell you right now: you will probably not have fun playing versus due to a lack of skill. The way the game is designed makes it this way, sadly, as the game, or pubs anyway, are filled with random stomps, trolls, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, etc, and getting destroyed every single game you play isn't very fun. So again, if you're casual and don't intend to learn the competitive side of the game that versus is, I'd stay away from it. Play versus with an all friends game if you really want to have fun with it.The badMany of the main complaints I, as well as many others have with the game is the numerous amount of glitches and bugs the game contains that Valve hasn't bothered to fix. If you're a casual player, you probably won't notice these things and I wouldn't bother reading this section if so as it hardly affects you. But if you're going to play the game for the competitive aspect, be prepared to deal with many unfair mechanics, such as chargers bumping right off of survivors as if they were a wall, jockeys not stumbling at all when you shove them allowing them to grab you instantly, getting hit by tank punches several melee lengths away, etc. This makes the game extremely frustrating, as well as with Valve's newest useless update, many of the servers are broken and unplayable, have all red pings, etc. You should really stick to competitive servers unless you don't mind dealing with pubs. Other than this, the game's pretty okay, there's not much else negative to it aside from the community. Except this game can get you fueled with rage at times regardless, lol			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 is a multiplayer zombie FPS game, completely based on teamwork. Let's put this quick and short. You know how in most multiplayer zombie games, you can just leave your team and be the hero? Well, in Left 4 Dead, if you try that stunt, you WILL die. Your team needs to work together to make it through countless hordes of zombies, Special Infected, obstacles, and hardest of all, Tanks. The Special Infected include all the S.I. from the old game, plus three new ones: The Charger, the Spitter, and the Jockey. Here is a list of all the Special Infected and their abilities:Hunter: Pounces on you and doesn't let go unless killed or shoved.Boomer: Vomits on you and attracts zombies to you. Explodes vomit everywhere when killed.Smoker: Constricts you with a long tongue and doesn't let go unless killed or you are shoved. Releases a cloud of smoke when killed.Spitter: Spits acid at you that cause damage. Releases a pool of acid when killed.The Jockey: Rides on your head and drags you sometimes into danger or more zombies. Does not let go unless killed or shoved off.The Charger: Charges at you from a distance and pummels you into the ground. Doesn't let go unless killed.Two major Special Infected include the Witch and the Tank:The Witch: a crying Infected woman who, when provoked by either loud sounds, light, or proximity of survivors, will attack the provoker and any other Survivors after her provoker is dead. She can incapacitate or even kill a Survivor in one hit. The Witch was in the first game as well, but Left 4 Dead 2 introduces a variant of the Witch that wanders aimlessly in the open.The Tank: a gigantic, extremely muscular Infected male with the strength to punch Survivors off their feet some distance, as well as toss cars and concrete slabs. Unless the Survivors work as a team, they will be quickly incapacitated or even killed by the Tank's inhuman strength.Other enemies include normal zombies, Clowns, Hazmat Suits, Construction Workers, Mudmen, etc. The Story goes like this (This is going to be a lot of information so sit tight and read it all if you want):     The Sacrifice DLC campaign takes place before the main events of Left 4 Dead 2; and after the events of The Sacrifice comic. The original survivors of Left 4 Dead—Bill, Francis, Louis, and Zoey—arrive at the portside town of Rayford, in order to search for a boat that can take them to the Florida Keys. After finding an adequate sailboat, the Survivors have to manually start up generators in order to lift a bridge for their boat to pass through. One Survivor (canonically Bill) sacrifices himself in order to kick-start a generator once it gives out, so that the others may reach safety. This is the end of Bill's story in the Left 4 Dead video game series.      Left 4 Dead 2 opens in Dead Center (set in Savannah, Georgia), where the four Survivors find themselves abandoned on a hotel roof by rescue helicopters. They decide to head for the local mall, where a second CEDA evacuation point is located. After a brief encounter with a gun store owner, Whitaker (voiced by Dayton Callie), the Survivors discover that the mall is overrun, with all CEDA agents having become either dead or infected as well. Ellis helps the group use a stock car to bust out of the mall and travel towards New Orleans, rumored to be the last standing city in America.     The Passing DLC campaign takes place between Dead Center and Dark Carnival, and after the events of The Sacrifice campaign. The Survivors of L4D2 arrive at the bridge in Rayford, where they meet Francis, Louis, and Zoey. As they need to cross the bridge to proceed, the Survivors need to find another way across to refill the generator with gas. After fighting their way through a wedding reception (complete with a Witch bride), the streets, and a historic under-the-river tour, they meet up again with the original Survivors, who help by covering for the group while they fill the generator and lowering the bridge once it's full.     At the start of the Dark Carnival campaign, the four Survivors find the highway ahead completely blocked by ditched vehicles, and are forced to travel on foot through an abandoned (but still-operating) amusement park. After navigating their way to the park stadium, Coach devises a plan to use a large-scale light show used by a rock band, The Midnight Riders, in order to signal a helicopter pilot for rescue.     After being rescued, they later discover that their pilot has been Infected. When the pilot starts attacking them, Nick is forced to kill him (echoing a similar situation in the first game), causing the chopper to crash into a bayou, the setting for Swamp Fever. Working their way through the swamps, the group comes across a crashed airplane, dead military paratroopers, and isolated swamp villages which had held out against the Infected but were eventually overrun. After spending the morning fighting through the swamp, the group arrives at a plantation mansion and make radio contact with Virgil, a Cajun boat captain who can assist them; however, his boat begins to run low on diesel fuel on the way to New Orleans. As a tumultuous rainstorm approaches (the titular Hard Rain of the subsequent campaign), the Survivors go ashore at Ducatel, Mississippi; make their way through an abandoned (and Witch-infested) sugarcane mill to a gas station to get diesel fuel, and return to signal Virgil with an improvised ""flare"".     In the final campaign, The Parish, Virgil drops the group off at New Orleans, where the military appears to be evacuating civilians across a bridge. On the way there, the four discover the city overrun with Infected, and that the military is actually leaving the city before it is destroyed by an air strike. The group manages to reach the bridge, where they make contact with the military. Judging from their dialogue, the military pilots suspect the Survivors to be ""carriers"", similar to the original Survivors of Left 4 Dead. After securing their rescue helicopter, the Survivors lower and cross the bridge, escaping on the helicopter just as the bridge is destroyed.  While the Survivors' fate is left unclear after this point, Chet Faliszek, the game's writer, said that the military is taking survivors to cruise ships in the Caribbean in an attempt to escape the infection.Left 4 Dead 2 comes with multiple modes to choose from. These modes are: Single Player, Multiplayer, Realism, Versus, Scavenge, Survival, and Mutation.Single Player is your basic finish the campaign and survive. Nothing much more to say.Multiplayer is the same thing, only with other players instead of bots.Realism mode makes things harder, like no regeneration and the actual time of helping people up in a horde of zombies.Versus is one team is the infected and the other team is the Survivors. The survivors have to go through the campaign without getting killed by the zombie players. The teams alternate everytime a safehouse is reached or the Survivors die.Scavenge is similar to the Dead Center finale, where you have to fill up a take with gas cans. Only in this mode, its not just Dead Center, it's all the other campaigns as well. Just fill the tank with gas. Nothing more.Survival gives you all the weapons and items, and forces you to try and survive against waves upon waves of zombies. The only objective is to see how far you can get.All in all, with a fantastic storyline, great multiplayer, unsettling atmosphere, and so much variety, Left 4 Dead 2 lives up to its predecesor, and is a game that I recommend to everyone who enjoys playing with friends and shooting zombies in the face.

I quickly became bored of it after playing the game with myself for hours on end after getting a copy for me. Then I discovered the glorious place we call Steam. My intentiosn where to buy games I could play anywhere, and Left 4 Dead 2 just so happened to be on that list after I heard about these wonderful things called mods. After aquireing said Mods from the wonderful workshop, Left 4 Dead 2 became a less cool game and became more funny.But honestly, what other game can you kill Hitler while playing as Blaziken?			"

												I got the game yesterday, but I was unable to play it due to me coming home a bit late. But finally today I was able to observe, study, and also play the game with 50-60 fps! (Even though my computer is 4.5-5 years old :V) The game is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone that likes a zombie, first person, co-op, and survival types of games. Also I would like to point out that there are also different types of special infected, so your in for a treat!Favourite Gun of Choice? Shotgun10/10Legendary job developers!			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 is like one of those arcade games where you shoot zombies. You can select your campaign, or ""map"", and each one lasts from 30 to 90 minutes. Guns and other items randomly spawn around the map. There are also ""ammo piles"", which are basically infinite sources of ammo for your guns that you can find. There are also medpacks and other HP items that you can use. Furthermore, upgrades for your guns, like temporary fire ammo or laser sights, spawn in certain areas. Now do you get what I mean by ""arcade-like""?Personally, I loved this game when I got into it. I played the first four campaigns on my first day playing this, and adored them all. My favorite part of this game is how the levels look and are layed out. I don't want to spoil anything, but some of them are pretty creative.Every couple of minutes you'll probably encounter a ""Special Infected"", or a zombie that has an ability that can screw you over in two seconds. Some can pounce on you and start ripping you to shreds, while others cover you in vomit that blinds you and makes you a zombie magnet for a while. However, there is one Special Infected that has a unique ability from the others, which I won't spoil.However, as much as I loved this game when I first played it, there are some downsides. After a few campaigns shooting zombies gets repetitive. Most of this game is just ""shoot the zombie"" and ""shoot the other zombie"" as you make your way through maps. Although Special Infected make it a bit more interesting, I would like to see more variety in enemies if they make a third game. However, seeing and exploring the maps is still fun, along with playing with friends and sometimes online (The community isn't exactly the best I've seen).Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes exploring, or arcade-like zombie shooters. Although it does get repetitive fast, there are things that encourage you to play like co-op and other game modes. Plus there's Steaam Workshop for this game, so you can download user-created campaigns or change your flashlight to an image of Shrek.			"

												A weird fps where the only game mode is DM. You spawn in a very small room with 3 other strangers called the ""safehouse"". Each safehouse is different in size and weapon spawn. Once the game starts it's a free for all to get the guns and blast eachother away. Here's the really cool thing about this game, you can get a killstreak by opening a door (there's one in every safehose) and letting these zombies and crazy monsters in the room to help you fight. Positive:- Really fun gameplay- Unlimited ammo- Multiplayer only (for some reason single player doesnt work, the bots dont fight)- A few maps have verticality (a bed, sink, ect)Negative:- Really small safehouse maps- The monsters should fight for whoever opens the door (please fix)- Not that many weapons- No customized classes or xp			"

												What I can easily say about this game, DAMN it never gets old. The old fasioned ""Work together or die"" aspect is retro enough for an oldies gamer, but the feel of the game is new enough that any of our current generation players could enjoy it. Personally, people who buy this game just for the Frying Pan and Ellis' Hat in Team Fortress 2, you don't know what your missing. If you're wanting a game to relax and enjoy, simply Solo campaign with AI Special Infected is just for you...but if you're wanting that competitive feel, Versus is great. You can take Arena-like Scavenge, or even play the campaigns in a competitive format of Versus, where the Infected human players work to stop you AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Your goal? Get farther than the other team in the campaign.This variety in the game, of both co-op and competitive, is what makes me come back. Even after several campaign playthroughs of both L4D1 and L4D2, if one gets boring I would switch to a competitive gamemode to see the game from another aspect. Truly, indeed worth the ten bucks paid during a sale (lol). WARNING: Competitive gamemodes most enjoyable with knowledge and understanding of the game. Understanding, not just game mechanics and items, but how to operate the infected. Have fun playing Charger and taking people off cliffs, rooftops, or docks and killing them instantly!			"

												I was introduced into the L4D universe in the first one, I never really got to play it but some time later L4D2 came out and I bought after remembering the fun my friends had playing the first one. All from each other’s houses and that seemed fun.So first thing about the game I’d like to talk about is the survivors. I understand leaving the first cast behind must have been somewhat though in the begging, however they first cast made it back in the awesome free DLC that completely defeated the purpose of having bought the first game.Personality wise, the new guys were kind of a letdown, Coach and Nick were alright for me, they could bring seriousness and humor into the game at the same time, Rochelle however was just as bland as a concrete slab and Ellis was just there to be the group clown with the ever-comical southern accent. I think they were alright and somehow ran away from the typical zombie survivor template but the first group felt like the formula and they should have left it that way.Next step brings us to the special infected. Having more of them instead of replacements was just right, the combos they could make both as bots or in competitive were nice, such as having a Spitter burning you up whenever you got pinned by one of the other infected, Jockeys dragging you away from the group when you are barely in the safe room, Chargers making the whole group fly into walls... It was nice to have to be more mindful about other threats. I’d also like to mention the “uncommon” infected from each chapter, they were like the chocolate chips on a normal horde cookie; they stood out, had a different function but were not as imposing as a special infected.To keep this review from being too long I’ll stand by the items and weapons. Most notably we have the new melee weapons. Many people leave those behind because they can shove with the normal weapons and gameplay wise some people considered them useless or unbalanced. I simply loved them, some were funny or simply badass but nothing beats mowing down a horde when close to death under adrenaline with a guitar while the rest of the group is back you up with guns from behind. Parts fly off, heads get smashed in and you get covered in the blood of your enemies. Melee is satisfying when used right... or with a chainsaw.The new guns were also cool, the magnum simply made a neat line of infected explode with a shot, the SCAR-H’s permanent burst fire was also something nice to have when you wanted more accurate shots without having to worry about the trigger, then that huge machine gun that came in the DLC was simply delicious to use, very limited ammo and no reloads, you just wait for a horde to unload it and scream the inner Rambo in you and lastly the grenade launcher that you should simply leave if you are not good with it or you are willing to sacrifice everyone’s health for some copious amounts of intestines flying off.Some more important new features were the defib packs that came to steal the importance of first-aid kits, the adrenaline shots that were perfect for that tight moment, the boomer bile to throw in a fire or at a tank, so much fun and lastly the weapon mods like laser sights and incendiary/explosive ammo, more tools to cause mayhem and survive in style.Overall, it’s a nice game to sink an afternoon in with friends, if you don’t have friends to play you can join random games but it’s not as fun. A mic is highly recommended to have higher survival chances. In case you get bored from running from zombies, there are game modes that allow to play as one or to hold your ground against waves of infected meat. There’s also the dreaded realism mode that removes all visual and audio hints and forces you group to be tight and communicate everything and on last word I’d like to talk about the maps, it’s the southern ‘merica experience and a refreshing area to play in, all the way to New Orleans.TL;DR: I am Rodrigosth and I recommend this game to you and your friends to play together.Special thanks to Hirow to help me keep my facts straight.

												Great game, and Valve has made this game fun for their Single Players as well too- THANKS VALVE! -Don't ever forget us!! I play only single player and I have over 100 hours into this game, plus close to as much in the first Left4Dead. I always have one of them loaded on my hard drive. Thanks Valve for another awesome game and I've been wondering, where's Left4Dead3 at already?! :)			"

Too bad, luckily, I'm informing you right now, I also, to help you out with this battle plan before them damn zombies get to you will say this, there are not only multiple game-modes to play, but you can also bring friends and even install add-ons to not only help you on your quest to survive this ordeal, but to also help you have some entertainment, and when could you NEED entertainment more than when you are killin' and slicin' and dicin' up zombies?

												Even though this was made back in 2009, it's fun to pick up a controller (or mouse) and play because the campaigns don't get repetitive unless you play the same one over and over. It also has all the L4D maps ported over but now includes melee weapons and the new Specials, so the old maps are great too. I got this in late 2012 and play it pretty much every day. Definitely worth picking up.			"

												One of the best co-op games I have ever played. Some people say that this game is linear (what games don't have linearity?). While it is true, the extensive modding community add so many unique characters, maps, weapons, and tactical situations that the linearity completely disappears, leaving behind a hectic battle for survival. You have multiple modes of gameplay. You can either fend for yourself in single player with bot helpers, go through a map with friends in campaign, or fight as infected in Versus and Scavenge. The difficulty modes add a lot of variety, as well. Expert requires the FPS skills of a Call Of Duty or Counter-Strike veteran and the teamwork of life-long friends. It's never tiring to go through any map, because there's so many ways to go through it and so many different situations. The events that happen because of it creates a lot of laughs and a lot of inspiring frustration. It can only get better from here as Valve releases sequels.			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 (L4D2) is a game made by Valve, about four survivors that have to go from a point A to point B, while defending themselves from zombies.------------------Gameplay: 9.5/10Gameplay is really nice. You have various gamemodes, many weapons, different types of zombies. Sometimes the game crashes or lags, it's rare. There are bugs, too and many tricks for both surivors and zombies. Also Valve is no longer updating that game, sadly.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Graphics: 10/10 Graphics are great, same with other SRC Engine games. You can compare them to textures from HL2, but they have different looks. Sometimes there are objects that appeared in other games, but that's normal in SRC Engine. Right now im playing on highest graphics, and it's working on 60 fps. By the way, i don't have a good PC, it can't handle Payday 2-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sounds/Soundtracks: 9,5/10Nothing much to say about that. There aren't alot of soundtracks, but there are various sounds. Check them yourself.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So, i RECOMMEND that game, it has alot of fun in itself, great to play with friends. Also, L4D2 has L4D AND L4D2 in itself, so do not buy the first game, unless you want to collect it. It's also a bit expensive, i prefer buying on a sale, which is very common. Great job Valve, great job. "

												Left 4 Dead 2 is a multiplayer first person shooter where you play one of four survivors attempting it to make it to the end of successive maps, surviving hordes of zombies. The zombies are attracted by sound and light, so your actions can determine how many you have to fight, in addition to a number of special infected who each have special abilities designed to inflict damage and/or separate the group.In addition to the normal co-op campaign, there is also a vs form of multiplayer where two teams of four take turns acting as special infected, trying to kill the other team as rapidly as possible. This is where the game really shines, especially if you've got a group of friends with which you can regularly fill a whole game of 8.The game is a quality single-player game to play through once, but its value really comes in the replayability of these multiplayer modes, as well as the multitude of player-designed maps and Steam Workshop content.I have not put more time into any other game on Steam.Highly, highly recommended, particularly if you've got some friends to play with.

												Very fun game. I very much enjoy when about 3 zombies run up around you and you can't move an inch and even when you spray about 18 shotgun shells into their face it seems to do nothing because Valve is such a great game company and has amazing coders. I also love the times when I am running from a Tank and then one little zombie hits me and causes me to go from running to a complete stop in about 2 miliseconds, but that's okay, I enjoy getting fisted by the tank. Another thing I enjoy is when it takes about 15 minutes to heal yourself with one med-pack. I think this adds alot of time so you can think about what a fun game you are playing. Even better than that is when your teammates or bots heal you with a med-pack. Nothing screams ""I love you"" more than when you heal someone with a med-pack that takes 10 minutes to use at the end of the finale. By far my favorite thing is the wide variety of characters to choose from. You get to choose between a redneck, a gambler, a fat black man and a ghetto/sassy black girl. Overall this game is perfect in every way. I rate it 10/10.			"

This was my first full zombie game on the pc and I am thoroughly enjoying playing it with friends and even complete randoms. I have not played any of the multiplayer or anything beyond the main campaign in co-op mode but my impressions of this game are first hand alone from the campaign. I would strongly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a zombie shooter to kill time with and enjoy the madness or even for a first time fps player.			"

Then another baboon came, he spoke in a weird language. To me it sounded like he had a baboon♥♥♥♥♥♥♥shoved deep down his throat. But this was not the case. He was actually just a normal russian baboon. I tried to communicate with him but the baboon♥♥♥♥♥♥♥must've slipped further down his throat. I heard nothing but mumbling and I could only hear a few words of his speech, I heard the mighty words ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"". Questioning how I would be able to communicate with him we jumped in-game. It came as a surprise to me, he could ♥♥♥♥ing communicate and the baboon♥♥♥♥♥♥♥seemed to have been surgically removed from his throat. He told me we were going to find victory on this glorious day and I answered with my fat polish accent ""you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ right""! Play this game and you will: - socialize with russians - kill zombies, kill more zombies- have cursing parties with more russians- kill your friends - die10/10 Would choke again "

												This game takes up way too much of my time.I used to be all up in Left 4 Dead's♥♥♥♥♥after playing it on the Xbox. I quickly became bored of it after playing the game with myself for hours on end after getting a copy for me. Then I discovered the glorious place we call Steam. My intentiosn where to buy games I could play anywhere, and Left 4 Dead 2 just so happened to be on that list after I heard about these wonderful things called mods. After aquireing said Mods from the wonderful workshop, Left 4 Dead 2 became a less cool game and became more funny.But honestly, what other game can you kill Hitler while playing as Blaziken?			"

												The game itself is fantastic, but the community on the other hand is garbage. People will kick you for any tiny reason, such as, but not limited to:Not having more than 100 hours in game.Not reviving a teammate wihin 2 seconds of them being incaped.Not saving a teammate within 2 seconds of them being pounced/snagged/Jockeyed/charged.Disturbing the witch.Going ahead of your team.Lagging behind your team.Not sharing pain pills/adrenaline even though you need it more.Not healing a teammate with your health kit even though you need it more.Accidental friendly fire.Stealing someone else's kill. Not vomiting on all four survivors as a Boomer.Missing a spit attack as a Spitter.Accidentally missing a charge.Not incapping any/all survivors in one life as a Tank.Do not get me wrong, I absolutely love this game and I would reccomend it to anyone (it also has a Steam Workshop that's better than GMod's.), but tl;dr, stick with Single Player, or if you're going to play online, you'd better invite some friends, cuz finding a server with decent randoms is harder than Expert difficulty.

												If you want a good game with a♥♥♥♥♥♥community this game is for you! Just going to straight up say that because that is the literal fact here. Sure this game is really good, but the public community just ruins it, very usually. Occasionally there are SOME decent people on this game, but much more usually jerks are. If you plan on buying this game I very highly reccomend usually playing with just friends.On another note, if you EVER play expert and see someone new start a random vote for no reason immediately shoot them down. It is insanely likely they are a greifer aiming to make it so you can't kick vote them. Downed player's pistols don't hurt team mates so they really cant do anything except think angry thoughts at you while they're on the ground. But back to the point, yes I reccomend this game, it truly is a masterpeice if you get past its♥♥♥♥♥♥community.9/10, losing 2 for♥♥♥♥♥♥community. If not for that 11/10.			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 is a great game. Say what you will about the way Valve treated the L4D community by delivering a sequel so quickly, but there's no denying that L4D2 is a better, more polished game than the first.This version adds new weapons, new healing options, and new special infected zombies that weren't present in the first. It doesn't really change gameplay much, but it does add a bit of variety that the original lacked. The maps are solid, and the weather effects are great, particularly in the Hard Rain level. The melee weapons that the first game painfully lacked are finally present here.There is an active map-building community, and Valve continues to offer official maps and gameplay support. This gives the game a fair amount of replay value. But most of the replay value comes from the Versus mode. A game of L4D2 Versus is a great experience that never gets tired.			"

												You play as one of four survivors trapped in an environment that would never happen in the real world, but it's a video game, so it HAS to be difficult, right!?You get to kill a vast array of zombies, like ""Chubby guy who explodes"" ""Guy with large tongue"" ""Mr. I love piggyback rides"" and our favorite friend ""Emo Tumblr girl who cries for attention and when she doesn't get the positive attention, she goes all out on you and tries to kill you.""Such characters as Tyreese from The Walking Dead and his girlfriend, and those two other people you can't remember the names of. There's also a lot of DLC, but it's free, so you can't complain.10/10 best golfing game.			"

												Its a pretty good game. It has a really cliche story line, but still not bad. Four strangers depending on one another due to compromising circumstances. Personally I think it is lacking a couple of things that I enjoy in a game, but thats just me. The sense of danger is quite lovely put. The ""Special Infected"" piece is a nice touch. Ok graphics. Slightly glitchy, but all games are bound to have a few (or a lot like skate 3).			"

												Every wanted to run crazily through a horde of zombies while screaming at your friends to shoot the small warted zombie riding on your shoulders trying to rip your head off?! Well this games for you!Pros+One of the best COOP experiences and up to 4 players.+Active community still(as of this writing)+Great modding community to add cool characters and weapon/equipment skins.+Gameplay feels great and smooth.+Zombie vs. Human online versus mode is fun and a great time killer.+5+ campaigns to play through around.+Some cool tricks and optimization could make this a fun game to speedrun.=Teamwork is key to this game. You can play solo, but COOP is where this game really shines and if you are not willing to cooperate then it might not be for you.Cons-Campaigns are a little short for some people, will take around 35-45 mins per campaign for new players depending on skills level.-Online players without mics, please for the love of Gaben almighty, if you are going to play an online COOP game please get and use a mic. This makes communicating and strategizing much easier and can make the gaming session much mroe enjoyable.Final thoughtIf you like zombie games, fast paced shooters or teamwork inspired gameplay, then you will love Left 4 Dead 2. This is a great successor to the first left for dead and does the series justice.			"

												Ever since 2009 when the only gameplay platform I had was an Xbox 360, Left 4 Dead 2 has always been my favorite game to exist to this day. No game has ever captivated me in gameplay and atmosphere like Left 4 Dead as a series has. Left 4 Dead 2 holds so much signifigance, as it was my gateway into gaming itself. I do believe that without this game, I wouldn't be as into First-Person Shooters or Post-Apocalyptic games as I am now. It's amazing to see that a game I enjoyed back in 2009 is still going strong with a playerbase in 2016, and the game is certainly one of the best games Valve has ever created and Turtle Rock Studios has ever sparked.Even though it is still going strong, it's a lie to say the game isn't dying. At it's prime, Left 4 Dead 2 had a 161,590 all-time peak (Not including console players), whereas games at it's time like Team Fortress 2 only reached a 110,000 all-time peak. It's very admirable and impressive, but Left 4 Dead 2's community is always steadily declining. However, the workshop has definitely kept a lot of players around, and me being an avid Versus player, I rarely ever run into the same person twice (probably 0.001% of games I've played have been with at most one person I've seen before, and that's only in the late-night hours).Overall, the game is amazing. Even after 7 years, the game is still amazing and still impresses. If you currently don't own Left 4 Dead 2, you're missing out on gaming history.			"

												This is definitely a fun game with an abundance of players and for the most part very nice people. There are many maps and many mods that are easy to download free and install. It is liner and repetitive although it has a lot of variation not only as to the map changing when you replay but also the monsters spawn in a variety of numbers. Then add in the players who join the game can also effect how you have to adapt to their skill or lack their of. It is a team player game and is easy to live chat each other. It lacks stealth, exploration, and adventure, but makes up for it with hours of fun killing Zombies and making it to the end of the session. Hardly ever a glitch, the graphics are good, and even if you can not get in a game with people you can play with robots to practice and learn the maps.I rate it only 3.5 stars only because of this constant desire to not always having to be running.  I am still hoping for another game like Metro that is multiplayer.			"

												I've spent literally several hundred hours playing this game, and still enjoy it. There are several modes of play and an incredible amount of custom content available to explore, helping to keep it fresh when you start to get bored of the regular game. Very highly recommended!			"

												Why Left 4 Dead 2 is one of the greatest games ever madeHave you ever asked yourself, “if the zombie apocalypse were to happen right now, what would I use to defend myself?” That’s like Left 4 Dead 2. Sure, it’s got first-person shooter gunplay at its heart, but with ammo limited, sooner or later you’re going to have to choose between a garden gnome or an electric guitar with which to smash up the undead hordes and save your frontal lobes from a trip through a zombie’s digestive tract. Brilliantly, despite such comical situations, Left 4 Dead 2 plays it all totally straight. The atmosphere is dark and dank with a terrifying feeling of hopelessness as you and your team make it to every new safehouse in a worse state than before.			"

L4D1 campaigns are also included here, so if you missed out on playing the first one you don't need to worry. If you get bored of vanilla L4D, there's plenty of mods on the workshop to keep things fresh.For maximum enjoyment play it with friends.			"

												I bought L4D2 11 years ago when I didn't have a  fast enough internet to play on steam. So I played it alone for years.About 6 years ago I tryed it again on a better internet. I got on to steam found real players and I was hooked. I play almost every night. There are some real good players that work togeather,  and that is the best fun. Of course there some bad ones.  Well I play every night so I take the bad with the good. L4D2 is a well balanced game and there so many ways to play. A ton of addons lets you do almost anything. The only game I play evert night you won't be sorry you got it.			"

												Although I have had not many hours playing on the PC version of L4D2  I have spent a lot of time playing on the 360 before it broke (don't judge). However I can say that I reallly do love this game, it is one of my favourite games to play. I mean I love it so much as soon as I couldn't play it on 360 anymore I got it again on PC. It is one of the best co-op games out there and the game came out in 2009. The gameplay is incredible and really fun even if you're playing singleplayer. I wouldn't recommend getting the game if singleplayer is your preferable choice because sometimes it can be dull (not to mention how bad the A.I's are on this game). As long as you got some friends to play the game with then I seriously suggest picking up this game. The only bad point I can think about on this game is the online commuinty. If you slip up once playing a co-op game with strangers you're gonna get kicked, no matter how small the slip up. I once took a medkit and got kicked for that. Overall though I do suggest to pick this game up, even if the community does suck♥♥♥♥♥♥for crack money. 10/10			"

												So I purchased this wonder of humanity.And I thought: ""Oh boy, I'm just gonna go kill some zombies with my friends, little did I know, my life was about to change for the better, so we started our first co-op campaign, and I wanted to be the character known as Coach, but my friend had locked him in, so I chose Ellis, already right out the gate I swear there has to be some sort of homo-erotic relationship between the 2 of them, as I kept spamming my friend with Med Kits bring out some wonderus quotes from the character which could be interpreted as sexual, it was at this point my firend mentioned there was a workshop addon which could transform Coach into Shrek, so our thrilling adventure devolved into homo-erotic talk about Coach as Shrek shouting profanities such as: ""DONKEY! (Ellis), GET OUT ME SWAMP (underwear drawer)!"" all in all great game and I do recommend, fun for the family, very diverse too a great game for all sexualities!10/10 would Shrek again.			"

												It really is a fun game when you play with friends or others online. Your A.I. mates aren't really that smart and respond slow to most crucial timings. So definitely recommend you don't play alone. The Gameplay itself is repetitive but you almost never play the same level twice. what I mean is that one that it has a radomizer so you'll most likely never run into the same Tank (boss of the game) at the same spot. The characters are pretty cool to connect with and aren't annoying one bit. includes the campaigns from the original L4D game so that's a nice bonus ^_^ But what really kept me from contuneing playing was the Mods in the L4D2 workshop and through L4Dmaps.com. they have a HUGE amount of mods so you can customize pretty much anything from the game. The community is most of the time nice but I did ran into ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who would kick me for not playing a certain instead of having some good ol fashion fun. overall, its a great game. I only wish Valve would release a Third game in my life time. 9/10 ^^""			"

												Long has it been said that Left 4 Dead shouldn't have had a sequel, but they did and I'm still so happy to this day that they did. No other game has made me laugh so much at friends screaming as a Hunter ripped them to shreds, curse so much that one of the Bots took so long to respond to my death screams or concentrate so hard when trying to get a 25 damage pounce during Versus mode.This game has consumed so much of my time that I look back and realise I don't regret any of those hours I spent in game. Not only that but the durability of this game with mods and maps is just fantastic and keeps me coming back for more.For a long period I had stopped playing this game, realising it was probably dying a slow death and the servers were all the same and getting kicked for no reason by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s was a constant fear. I have put those fears aside by playing exclusively on the Marvelous Gaming servers, with no reason to fear being kicked ever again.If you're looking for a game experience that keeps on giving and a community that keeps on creating, you can't look past Left 4 Dead 2. The gaming landscape is continuously evolving and L4D2 is keeping up through it's endless supply of mods and maps released on the Workshop. For me, this is my 'Game of the Decade'.;tldrGet this game at full price, half price or that one time when it was free for 24hrs... you won't regret it!			"

												I should've realized this game is great when I saw it's made by Valve. But I thought meh, co-op shooting can't be that fun. Well, it's not just fun, it's uber-fun. Good thing they offered it for free that Christmas day, otherwise I would've probably never tried it, and I would've missed hours of fun.Playing versus mode is my favorite. Being a ""special infected"" hunting survivors was incredibly entertaining, both challenging and... so rewarding. Managing to isolate one of my friends who played a survivor, then kick the xxxx out of him and ruin his team's score felt better than a Dota rampage.I also like the characters (though I wouldn't have minded if the chicks were even sexier), the story, the many modes, the variety of monsters and locations - briefly, everything about this game.

												Pros :+ One of the best Co Op games of all time+ One of the pioneer of zombie Co Op survival game+ Epic workshop mods.The basic game DOES gets boring after a while even if you're playing with your friends.But with the mods  installed ? The replay value is now much more improved.Imagine shooting Skyrim dragons instead of tanks.Stormtroopers instead of zombies.Dota heroes instead of special zombies.Epic fun and seriously funny.You can change almost everything.+ Challenging,but still gives you the much needed fun.You can still enjoy playing it without getting frustrated.+ Storyline isn't empty anymore.The mission has its story and reasons for you to play along.+ Fun gameplay modes.Co Op Zombie survival isn't the only option.Cons :- Devs should add more levels.People will get bored if they never update the mission.They can't rely on workshop maps alone.- Not all people wants to spend their time searching for good maps and typing commands in order to make their installed mods compatible.This is one of the reasons they should add more official levels rather than depending on workshop maps.- Limited guns options.Even though with the epic workshop skin edits,more gun options will make the game way much more interesting.And it will offer more weapons for the skin editors to mod.They should make Left 4 Dead 3 with epic graphics like Dying Light/CoD/Battlefield/Crysis etc.No old games will stay for long .Nothing will thrive in the future if they keep forcing the old ways into the new modern gamer community.Even Counter-Strike make Global Offensive.Why don't Left 4 Dead make a new sequel with updated engine ?

The campaigns in the game offer countless hours of entertaining zombie killings and when you get boredt of the same old maps you can turn to the Left 4 Dead community for new addon Campaigns and tons of funny, awesome and creative mods. As I´m writing this I have played over 700 hours with no end in sight. Great fun to play with friends as a co-op of 4 or as a versus of 8. Multiple fun mutation games with scanvenge and survival modes keep the gameplay interesting.So come on in and slay a zombie or two or million :D			"

												Hey everyone. Let's talk about the game, which I wasted 3+ years of my life. I gotta say that L4D2 is a very fun game to play especially with friends. But if you don't have any friends (like me) and you want to play this game, then... well... good luck then. And what I meant by that?Newbies are fine. If they're not deaf and can communicate, then it's absolutely fine to play with 'em. We can play slowly and help each other, help improve and have fun. If you're a newbie and want some help, then you have to be nice. Nobody wants to help rude people with no manners.Try-hards ARE not fine. They're everywhere and if you happen to ♥♥♥♥ up somewhere while playing with 'em. You'll get kicked out from the game without hesitation. The community is getting more and more ♥♥♥♥♥ier. Also, if you enjoy playing on expert, then you'll definitely meet some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who just randomly joins the game, shoots everyone and leaves. I'm not even surprised anymore.What I want to say is please think twice, or even thrice, before buying this game. I love this game, but I highly recommend it to peeps who have friends to play with.  Unless you're prepared to get shot down by stupid players and then kicked out from the game.But there's chance that you'll meet good peeps who will probably help you improve. I even found server full of friendly Russians. Search for peeps who focuses on having fun rather than winning. It's not very often you get to meet nice, kind, great teamplayers. But once you do, then all the fun begins.			"

												This game is pretty much wow once you will get on higher skill level.You are starting to understand all mechanics, system, and it's a time when you realise how amazing the concept of this game is. All the little pieces connecting each other making almost flawless art.I can say i regret some time spent on this game, some matches were crappy, but despite that, i just couldn't stop playing this game. It gives so much fun.The thing i like the most about this game is that it forces you to use brain most of the time, it's not just brainless multiplayer shooting game. Every attack is pretty much predicting enemy, spatial imagination to block spawns at its finest.. you have to be focused all the time. Also you have to make decisions quickly. This are very important skills in real life too.Thing that hurts the most is that L4D2 was ""left"" by Valve. There are still some bugs that need fix, or like 0 interest in competetive l4d2.3,827 hours on record by now, and i highly doubt it will stop before reaching 5k.Love this game, buy it, learn it, master it.

												One hell of a fun game to play, sure Xbox 360 might've been fun, but on the PC it's even better, now with a built-in Steam Workshop to help customize your own apocalypse, all for free. Picked this game up + Left 4 Dead 1 for $7.50 during the Summer Sale and man was it worth the price! Definitely recommend it for any hardcore gamer, hell give it as a gift, send it to your friends, SPREAD THE LOVE...and blood. This game is great, definitely check it out, you won't be disappointed.

												Left 4 Dead 2 is one of the best games I have ever played. It just never gets old! The gameplay is really awesome, and shooting the hell out of zombies with your friends is always a good time!This brings me to my next point. This game is a hundred times better when played with friends. I played this almost every night for a year or two on the Xbox 360 and met 2 of my really good friends on there. It's even more fun to play on Steam because you can use mods to make the game cooler and funnier, and even add new campaigns.I strongly suggest getting this game.			"

												Great game that encourages teamwork and using a little strategy and patience to survive. I think my favorite part though is the mods you can get for the game, can easily turn this game from spooky to downright hilarious.Tank scaring you? Turn it into Shrek!Smoker annoying or creepy? Turn it into the Dusk from Kingdom Hearts and give it the Yoshi soundfont.Hunter's pounce annoy you? Give it the Sonic soundfont, at least makes it somewhat funny.Boomers? Turn them into Dr. Robotnik (yes, there is a mod like that, look it up)Don't like the music? Find new music from the workshop you like.This game + Workshop = Hilarity and much more funner game playing. :D			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 is a sequal that deliver's more that what the original can offer. And yes it may be the same thing over and over again with different maps and areas. But the mods are a MAJOR reason why its still alive today. To fighting zombies and the next minute to Fighting Teletubbies with the crew from FNAF (Five Nights At Freddy's) while Shrek, Slender, Donky and Diddy Kong all try to kill you in Super Mario 64 on Survival.I love this game and cannot recommend it anymore than I can.

												Long has it been said that Left 4 Dead shouldn't have had a sequel, but they did and I'm still so happy to this day that they did. No other game has made me laugh so much at friends screaming as a Hunter ripped them to shreds, curse so much that one of the Bots took so long to respond to my death screams or concentrate so hard when trying to get a 25 damage pounce during Versus mode.This game has consumed so much of my time that I look back and realise I don't regret any of those hours I spent in game. Not only that but the durability of this game with mods and maps is just fantastic and keeps me coming back for more.For a long period I had stopped playing this game, realising it was probably dying a slow death and the servers were all the same and getting kicked for no reason by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s was a constant fear. I have put those fears aside by playing exclusively on the Marvelous Gaming servers, with no reason to fear being kicked ever again.If you're looking for a game experience that keeps on giving and a community that keeps on creating, you can't look past Left 4 Dead 2. The gaming landscape is continuously evolving and L4D2 is keeping up through it's endless supply of mods and maps released on the Workshop. For me, this is my 'Game of the Decade'.;tldrGet this game at full price, half price or that one time when it was free for 24hrs... you won't regret it!			"

												So I purchased this wonder of humanity.And I thought: ""Oh boy, I'm just gonna go kill some zombies with my friends, little did I know, my life was about to change for the better, so we started our first co-op campaign, and I wanted to be the character known as Coach, but my friend had locked him in, so I chose Ellis, already right out the gate I swear there has to be some sort of homo-erotic relationship between the 2 of them, as I kept spamming my friend with Med Kits bring out some wonderus quotes from the character which could be interpreted as sexual, it was at this point my firend mentioned there was a workshop addon which could transform Coach into Shrek, so our thrilling adventure devolved into homo-erotic talk about Coach as Shrek shouting profanities such as: ""DONKEY! (Ellis), GET OUT ME SWAMP (underwear drawer)!"" all in all great game and I do recommend, fun for the family, very diverse too a great game for all sexualities!10/10 would Shrek again.			"

												Imagine Duke Nukem, wielding a master sword, holding off a horde of zombies so that Phoenix Wright, Princess Luna, and Spongebob can escape to the safehouse, cutting down one after another until Hitler dives out from the horde and tackles him ripping out his neck.Later on their journey Luna and Spongebob get into an argument, and Luna tries to resolve it by throwing a molotov cocktail at Spongebob's feet. Spongebob proceeds to pull out an axe and kill Luna. Shortly after Diddy Kong leaps onto his head and pulls him off a building.As the last survivor of his group, Phoenix Wright continues on to the safehouse, determined to get there for the sake of his comrades. Just as he is closing in on his destination, though, he hears I'm Too Sexy For My Shirt playing in the background. His eyes widen. He knows what's coming. Suddenly Shrek appears from around the corner, holding a massive piece of sidewalk in his strong ogre hands. Phoenix turns around, only to find himself faced with Slenderman if he runs. Out of ammo, he decides to go down fighting. Brandishing his frying pan, he charges at Shrek, letting out a scream of rage as he does so.Unfortunately, Phoenix was decapitated by a flying piece of concrete.This is the kind of game Left 4 Dead 2 is.

												This game is pretty much wow once you will get on higher skill level.You are starting to understand all mechanics, system, and it's a time when you realise how amazing the concept of this game is. All the little pieces connecting each other making almost flawless art.I can say i regret some time spent on this game, some matches were crappy, but despite that, i just couldn't stop playing this game. It gives so much fun.The thing i like the most about this game is that it forces you to use brain most of the time, it's not just brainless multiplayer shooting game. Every attack is pretty much predicting enemy, spatial imagination to block spawns at its finest.. you have to be focused all the time. Also you have to make decisions quickly. This are very important skills in real life too.Thing that hurts the most is that L4D2 was ""left"" by Valve. There are still some bugs that need fix, or like 0 interest in competetive l4d2.3,827 hours on record by now, and i highly doubt it will stop before reaching 5k.Love this game, buy it, learn it, master it.

To fighting zombies and the next minute to Fighting Teletubbies with the crew from FNAF (Five Nights At Freddy's) while Shrek, Slender, Donky and Diddy Kong all try to kill you in Super Mario 64 on Survival.I love this game and cannot recommend it anymore than I can.

												Left 4 Dead 2 is one of the best games I have ever played. It just never gets old! The gameplay is really awesome, and shooting the hell out of zombies with your friends is always a good time!This brings me to my next point. This game is a hundred times better when played with friends. I played this almost every night for a year or two on the Xbox 360 and met 2 of my really good friends on there. It's even more fun to play on Steam because you can use mods to make the game cooler and funnier, and even add new campaigns.I strongly suggest getting this game.			"

												Hey everyone. Let's talk about the game, which I wasted 3+ years of my life. I gotta say that L4D2 is a very fun game to play especially with friends. But if you don't have any friends (like me) and you want to play this game, then... well... good luck then. And what I meant by that?Newbies are fine. If they're not deaf and can communicate, then it's absolutely fine to play with 'em. We can play slowly and help each other, help improve and have fun. If you're a newbie and want some help, then you have to be nice. Nobody wants to help rude people with no manners.Try-hards ARE not fine. They're everywhere and if you happen to ♥♥♥♥ up somewhere while playing with 'em. You'll get kicked out from the game without hesitation. The community is getting more and more ♥♥♥♥♥ier. Also, if you enjoy playing on expert, then you'll definitely meet some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who just randomly joins the game, shoots everyone and leaves. I'm not even surprised anymore.What I want to say is please think twice, or even thrice, before buying this game. I love this game, but I highly recommend it to peeps who have friends to play with.  Unless you're prepared to get shot down by stupid players and then kicked out from the game.But there's chance that you'll meet good peeps who will probably help you improve. I even found server full of friendly Russians. Search for peeps who focuses on having fun rather than winning. It's not very often you get to meet nice, kind, great teamplayers. But once you do, then all the fun begins.			"

												One hell of a fun game to play, sure Xbox 360 might've been fun, but on the PC it's even better, now with a built-in Steam Workshop to help customize your own apocalypse, all for free. Picked this game up + Left 4 Dead 1 for $7.50 during the Summer Sale and man was it worth the price! Definitely recommend it for any hardcore gamer, hell give it as a gift, send it to your friends, SPREAD THE LOVE...and blood. This game is great, definitely check it out, you won't be disappointed.

												It really is a fun game when you play with friends or others online. Your A.I. mates aren't really that smart and respond slow to most crucial timings. So definitely recommend you don't play alone. The Gameplay itself is repetitive but you almost never play the same level twice. what I mean is that one that it has a radomizer so you'll most likely never run into the same Tank (boss of the game) at the same spot. The characters are pretty cool to connect with and aren't annoying one bit. includes the campaigns from the original L4D game so that's a nice bonus ^_^ But what really kept me from contuneing playing was the Mods in the L4D2 workshop and through L4Dmaps.com. they have a HUGE amount of mods so you can customize pretty much anything from the game. The community is most of the time nice but I did ran into ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who would kick me for not playing a certain instead of having some good ol fashion fun. overall, its a great game. I only wish Valve would release a Third game in my life time. 9/10 ^^""			"

												So I purchased this wonder of humanity.And I thought: ""Oh boy, I'm just gonna go kill some zombies with my friends, little did I know, my life was about to change for the better, so we started our first co-op campaign, and I wanted to be the character known as Coach, but my friend had locked him in, so I chose Ellis, already right out the gate I swear there has to be some sort of homo-erotic relationship between the 2 of them, as I kept spamming my friend with Med Kits bring out some wonderus quotes from the character which could be interpreted as sexual, it was at this point my firend mentioned there was a workshop addon which could transform Coach into Shrek, so our thrilling adventure devolved into homo-erotic talk about Coach as Shrek shouting profanities such as: ""DONKEY! (Ellis), GET OUT ME SWAMP (underwear drawer)!"" all in all great game and I do recommend, fun for the family, very diverse too a great game for all sexualities!10/10 would Shrek again.			"

L4D1 campaigns are also included here, so if you missed out on playing the first one you don't need to worry. If you get bored of vanilla L4D, there's plenty of mods on the workshop to keep things fresh.For maximum enjoyment play it with friends.			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 is probably one of the most intensive co-op multiplayer fps you will ever play.  I have never played a game that was so rigidly dependant on good teamwork.  Campaign mode gets old after a while but Versus and Scavenge is where its at for competitive gameplay.  New mutations every week keep it fresh and interesting.  Would definitely recommend having a mic as a lot of the game requires you to be in constant communication with your team, particularly in modes like Realism Versus, where a micless player can be crippling for its team.  It seperates itself from the first Left 4 Dead in there being more maps, modes, special infected, and director dynamics, leading to a much more varied experience.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves co-op gameplay!  This is a must have.			"

												Warning : This will drag you in and hold you there , pounding you into submission over and over again and you'll love it.If you have never played anything like this before, it will probably only take you at the most 30 minutes to get the hang of. The plot is thin, like most zombie stuff. (Walking Dead exlcuded) Green Flu made it all happen. All hell broke loose and the outbreak quickly spread. You are a memeber of a group of survivors constantly chasing rescue points. Constantly chasing hope. Despite the fact that hope is brutally crushed most of the time. That's something I want to focus on here, as there have been numerous , brilliant reviews of this game. What really grabbed me was the never ending optimism of the characters in the game. No matter how many times they battle their way through hell and back, just to get to an escape point leading to a boat/bridge/helicopter/train etc, it always goes wrong and lands them some where else but in the same situation. This becomes more extreme, and literal, if you play in survivor mode. It's not whether you survive but how long you survive for. Not so long ago computer games were all about winners and losers. Great sparkly rewards as the world is saved and celebrations are had all round. This game takes us back to the old days of Asteroids and Space Invaders. You know you will always die. Some times very quickly. Perseverance, endurance and dogged determination to team work and strategy are the only way to survive in this cold and bleak world. Cooperative playing. Mutual aid. Survival of the fittest is no longer the carrion call, now it is survival of the most organised and cohesive. It's understandable that this game is so addictive. In modern day society , 'wealth for self above every one else' is the motto of the day. Creating such a fun and excting world where working together as packs/ tribes is innately appealing to our species nature. Which explains much of the massive multi online gaming  team games appeal. Once you start playing around with the community mods you enter a whole new world every single game. Aliens instead of common infected, predators as Hunters. You can even play in Mario World with Mario characters if you so choose. No ? Then maybe play as 4 raptors armed to the teeth in the midst of a zombie apocalypse. Still not enough ? How about defending Helms Deep with all of the bells and whistles of the Tolken world ? There's even an RPG single player mod. It has been over 5 years since I last invested so much time into a game. Never have I done that with an online game until now. You probably all ready own this , so you get how cool it is. Punt me a message if you wanna defend Helms Deep in survival mode some time :)See y'all in the apocalypse !			"

												This is the kind of game that you can play for hours and hours, and never really get tired of it. It's a great way to relieve some stress after a long day; just grab a drink, take a seat, and destroy masses of zombies. Most of the various game modes are pretty fun, and of course, it only gets better if you have a couple friends to play with online. Classic source engine graphics, tons of add-on items, maps, and campaigns, of which many can be found right here in the Steam Workshop. Endless fun, near-infinite add-ons, a great community, and at the end of the day, arguably the best zombie apocolypse first person shooter on the current market. Buy it.			"

												Its a fun arcade zombie shooter, and its a hell of a fun with friends + modded servers. The L4D2 community really knows how to make the game better and more fun. I would be happy if and/or when L4D3 comes out, I wonder what Source 2 will bring, and what possibilities you can do with its modding kit. One thing that would make me happy, is bigger map sizes. Current map size for Hammer (Source Engine) is not big enough, heh.			"

												Easily my favorite game of all time and a must have for any gamer's library. The zombies are unique and the game has a good selection of guns and fun melee weapos. I usually play the vanilla campaign on advanced most of the time; just for the immersion factor. But theres tons of different types of matches where you can be a zombie and hunt people and a bunch of types I haven't even tried yet. Recently I was taught how amazing the gun and blood mods are from the workshop! It can reallly revitalize how the game feels burt there is a lot of playability in this title even without mods.After all this time people still play so you know its good 10/10+++ If you already own this and have less than 100 hours go play L4D2 for god's sake!!

												Overall a really cool game in the zombie / coop genre, but honestly the community is not as good as 2, 3 years ago and it's just getting worse both in behaviour and skill of the players, which hurts all coop based games  (incl. L4D2).You should try to find a good people and players. I personally have found many really great people around the world to play and talk with, which is one of the main purposes of coop games. Unluckily, there are also fake and arrogant loosers making a bad reputation to the L4D2...			"

												I enjoy this game, especially with friends. You get to kick back, and massacre zombies, or struggle through, and triumph over adversity, depending on the difficulty. The different types of special infected present different obstacles, and make it much more interesting than any old plain zombie shooter. Granted the game is kinda old, but it still has quite the following!    If you are new to the game, I'd stay away from Realism mode/Advanced Difficulty/Expert Difficulty/Versus (the highly competetive, and difficult PvP aspect) And Scavenge (Like VS, but you have to collect gas cans, while fighting off the infected). At least until you know where you're going/how to deal with all the specials/have friends to play with so you don't get votekicked/and have a decent amount of experience with the game. (Just because those modes can have an unforgiving community, and will scare you off from playing it again...) If you do start out on those modes, I'd HIGHLY suggest doing it with friends first, so you can get a feel for it before going to public games, where people are often criticizing over the littlest mistakes.  If you don't wanna spend much money, wait until it goes on sale.If you want it FOR FREE wait until the holidays around december, when it's at no cost to you. Get your friends to get it then, and you can have a blast together!  It has Workshop Support, so you can have different music, weapon/item/character skins, and new maps, and gamemodes too!  If you don't know whether you want this game or not, ask a friend, or get it around Christmas for free, and if you don't like it, you'll have lost nothing! Lastly: Don't get discouraged if people are talking crap about you, or if you're having trouble playing. Make an effort to play better, smarter, and have a decent mic!  Overall I LOVE playing this with friends, because there's no pressure. When you and your buddies can defeat public teams in vs, or make people ragequit, you'll feel great about your accomplishments. Keep at it, and you'll get better!  Also check out some guides! My friend has some informative quides, and here's the link for some of them!http://steamcommunity.com/id/LarryShadowGhostDyes/myworkshopfiles/?section=guidesI hope you enjoy L4D2, and hope you become a great player someday! Maybe I'll see you in a VS match... Best of luck!			"

												Do you miss shooting zombies? Never shot zombies? Just finished a different zombie shooting experience? Great. You will probably love shooting these zombies. Always best to play with friends because teamwork is crucial on almost any difficulty, and sometimes the bots, you know... are bots. It is still fun alone, but who who will you tell it was the bot's fault? Damnit Rochelle! The workshop has good community content, though it can take some sifting to find solid full campaigns. All in all, do it. It's good stuff.			"

												I have to say, I enjoy building shelter just as the next guy, but this game has scarred me for life. I used to think of Left 4 Dead 3 as a fun game, occasionally going out to go mining with my friends from daycare, crafting wood swords, killing sheep, and such. But the amount of vending machines in this game is just too darn high. I try to eat healthy, keeping a strict diet to make sure I don't get too slippery. I Ocassionally go out for breakfast at Pizza Hut (around 2 or 3 times a week) but the sugary drinks in this game make it unfathomably hard to keep it fresh. Please, not just for me, but for the dogs too, take out sugary drinks from this game. Not only does it make you slippery, but a recent article has linked soda drinks to autism. This isn't just for me, but also the dogs that are fed soda each and everyday. Overall solidy bad of a greatly bad good game.			"

												This is one of my favorite games on Steam so far and I never get tired of it. It's a great zombie apocalypse online game with cool characters, interesting stories, and the dynamics are good. The controls are relatively simple to learn and there's a wide enough range of apsects you can change such as the zombies, weapons, character models, etc. to keep it exciting. I definitely recommend this game to others.			"

												One of those games that get played 2-3 days a week, in either campaign or versus since there are millions of possible ways for any game to turn out. With a huge amount of Custom campaigns and maps put out by the community, its difficult to not play it every so often.The real kicker is the community, since there is either the newbies who just wanna learn, the griefing cretins that just pop in and out and get mad when they get a votekick on them, the try hards that got hacks up and boost about how 'good' they are (and ragequit when they get steamrolled), and then theres everyone else that just plays it for FUN.

												I, Like many others I know, have spent hundreds and hundreds of hours playing this game, and this is why. Left 4 Dead brings the best combination of Cooperative team play, gore, content and fun all into one package. I have NEVER come across such a repetitive game, but have each time I play it bring something new, and partnered with the steam workshop, I can Customise my game how I like it to make the experience even better. Allthough there are glitches here and there, and the occasional crash, I love it, and will continue to play it, regardless of new releases... unless of course L4D3 comes out... there's a game that needs to be released... In terms of online play, You'll meet the occasional imbecile, but where don't you? Versus is the game mode I play most. The fact you get to be a special infected is epic, but only when you don't get killed xD I recommend this game to anyone. It is seriously awesome.			"

This review is a little lengthy, so if you just want to know why I recommend this game skip the Results and read from there.Valve produces one of the most rigorous zombie games ever created. This fantastic first person shooter offers co-operative play which puts you right in the apocalypse that really keeps you on the run. Story:Left 4 Dead 2 places you as a character in a movie: Louis, Zoey, Francis, Bill, Coach, Ellis, Nick or Rochelle. Each level is suppose to be a part of a movie which combines into a single story. There are two stories which involve the first four characters or the latter. Eventually the characters from each movie integrate and intermingle joining the two movies together as one. There is a clear start and finish to the story, but as you play the maps online the story gets conveluded and lost. But if you play the campaign in order you will notice connections between all the maps that drive the characters to a set objective. Left 4 Dead 2 is a movie and as such the characters are unrealistically attributed with super human strength, unrealistic accuracy, and cheesy lines all of which are similar to most action movie stars.Campaign:Left 4 Dead 2 drops you right into a zombie apocalypse. The campaign consists of both Left 4 Dead 2 and remastered Left 4 Dead levels. The included campaigns are: No Mercy, Crash Course, Death Toll, Dead Air, Blood Harvest, The Sacrifice, Dead Center, The Passing, Dark Carnival, Swamp Fever, Hard Rain, The Parish, and Cold Stream. This can be expanded upon with hundreds of maps created using the editor which sometimes are better constructed than the originals. The brilliance behind this game is that due to a basic AI instructor the zombie placement changes every time you play a level which produces high replay value.Modding:Not only can you replay the included levels a plethora of times without being bored, but the workshop allows you to expand upon that and download new maps and mods that make the game better with every adjustment. You can even go to certain websites and download maps created by the community there. I personally prefer to download my maps from community websites as they are easier to install from the website. If you like fast paced zombie games and have some friends to play with this is the game for you. Gameplay:Left 4 Dead 2 is a fast paced Zombie first person shooter that involves running between areas to safe houses. Each level has chapters which you must run through, these chapters can either be incredibly long or ridiculously short. You have the choice to take it slow and work your way through the levels in time, or go as fast as you can. Typically teams that go slow do worst because as time progresses they must face more enemies than quicker teams. Hordes of fast moving zombies spawn in ways that can seem endless. Like most zombie games a headshot is much more effective than a chest shot, but enemies can still be taken down either way. Multiplayer:One of the epic features about this series is the online multiplayer. In this mode you are pitted as teams undead or survivors. The undead spawn as special zombies and must collaborate to kill off the survivors. Survivors on the other hand must complete objectives or finish chapters without all being perished. The multiplayer is brilliant, although it can be a little less fun if you don’t have someone to play with as this is a heavily team based game. Results:If you love zombie games, you like co-op experiences, you understand how to install mods, you just want to be an action hero, or even you just want to play by yourself Left 4 Dead 2 is the game for you. The amazing AI director makes the same map different every time. The bots although not the smartest can make a single player experience fun, and with some mods you can easily switch between players and control the bots if you accidently die. The game is an amazing action thriller that keeps you on your toes and constantly wanting more. Pros:+Four player co-op campaigns that last at most one hour each+Good graphics and smooth animations+Fantastic zombie feel without seeming too mind-numbing (making zombies intelligent and tactful)+Fun campaigns that blow away realism and just create action packed fun.+Workshop compatible allowing for large amounts of mods and customization+Basic AI so you can play with a single friend without having to join a game onlineCons:-Mods are not perfect and can cause the game to crash (so remember what you installed before each play-through in order to remove defective files)-Bots are essentially mentally handicapped even with Bot Mods-Bots will not use the defibrillator unit-When playing single player the human player cannot switch between bots in order to continue enjoying the game despite their own demise-Some weapons seem excessive and worthless (two different types of pump shotguns)-Poor servers in comparison to the Xbox 360 (I miss mod free servers)			"

												Do you miss shooting zombies? Never shot zombies? Just finished a different zombie shooting experience? Great. You will probably love shooting these zombies. Always best to play with friends because teamwork is crucial on almost any difficulty, and sometimes the bots, you know... are bots. It is still fun alone, but who who will you tell it was the bot's fault? Damnit Rochelle! The workshop has good community content, though it can take some sifting to find solid full campaigns. All in all, do it. It's good stuff.			"

												As someone who originally purchased on the release for the Xbox I can easily say this is one of the funniest and best FPS games I've ever touched having put a good amount of hours on PC version. If you've never touched the Left 4 Dead (2) Titles I highly recommend picking it up now. It has the perks of never-ending fun and addons to bring ever more fun to your experience. Not to mention the amount of times I've played on Bridge_Finale and have gotten charged/smacked off the bridge. 10/10 would do so again.			"

												I have to say, I enjoy building shelter just as the next guy, but this game has scarred me for life. I used to think of Left 4 Dead 3 as a fun game, occasionally going out to go mining with my friends from daycare, crafting wood swords, killing sheep, and such. But the amount of vending machines in this game is just too darn high. I try to eat healthy, keeping a strict diet to make sure I don't get too slippery. I Ocassionally go out for breakfast at Pizza Hut (around 2 or 3 times a week) but the sugary drinks in this game make it unfathomably hard to keep it fresh. Please, not just for me, but for the dogs too, take out sugary drinks from this game. Not only does it make you slippery, but a recent article has linked soda drinks to autism. This isn't just for me, but also the dogs that are fed soda each and everyday. Overall solidy bad of a greatly bad good game.			"

												This is one of the best games I've ever played. If you like teamplay in an FPS, you want to own this game! Teamplay is obligatory, meaning one strong carry can usually not win this game by himself, as it is possible in many other competitive games. This is especially true for versus mode, in which four survivors play against four special infected.Because of the emphasis on teamplay, the community is rather unwelcoming towards beginners. Especially in versus mode, new players will be kicked before they know it. I recommend a few hundred hours of campaign playing to every newbie.10/10: You can survive the zombie apocalypse with a frying pan. "

Product received for free
												I enjoy this game, especially with friends. You get to kick back, and massacre zombies, or struggle through, and triumph over adversity, depending on the difficulty. The different types of special infected present different obstacles, and make it much more interesting than any old plain zombie shooter. Granted the game is kinda old, but it still has quite the following!    If you are new to the game, I'd stay away from Realism mode/Advanced Difficulty/Expert Difficulty/Versus (the highly competetive, and difficult PvP aspect) And Scavenge (Like VS, but you have to collect gas cans, while fighting off the infected). At least until you know where you're going/how to deal with all the specials/have friends to play with so you don't get votekicked/and have a decent amount of experience with the game. (Just because those modes can have an unforgiving community, and will scare you off from playing it again...) If you do start out on those modes, I'd HIGHLY suggest doing it with friends first, so you can get a feel for it before going to public games, where people are often criticizing over the littlest mistakes.  If you don't wanna spend much money, wait until it goes on sale.If you want it FOR FREE wait until the holidays around december, when it's at no cost to you. Get your friends to get it then, and you can have a blast together!  It has Workshop Support, so you can have different music, weapon/item/character skins, and new maps, and gamemodes too!  If you don't know whether you want this game or not, ask a friend, or get it around Christmas for free, and if you don't like it, you'll have lost nothing! Lastly: Don't get discouraged if people are talking crap about you, or if you're having trouble playing. Make an effort to play better, smarter, and have a decent mic!  Overall I LOVE playing this with friends, because there's no pressure. When you and your buddies can defeat public teams in vs, or make people ragequit, you'll feel great about your accomplishments. Keep at it, and you'll get better!  Also check out some guides! My friend has some informative quides, and here's the link for some of them!http://steamcommunity.com/id/LarryShadowGhostDyes/myworkshopfiles/?section=guidesI hope you enjoy L4D2, and hope you become a great player someday! Maybe I'll see you in a VS match... Best of luck!			"

This is sad because this is a really good game massively ruined by the community, only get it if you have friends to play with or you'll get votekicked and insulted like hell. I can't even think of any gaming community more♥♥♥♥♥♥than this one.			"

												Зомби,апокалипсис,оружие,кишки.Игра мне понравилась.Приятно убивать зомбарей,или играть за них,НО 2 часть в графическом плане хуже,ведь разрабы поменялись.НОГ у персонажа не видно от 1 лица,смерть в одной и той же анимации,но покупая эту игру вы получаете не только 2 часть этой игры,но и говяно портированую 1 часть.Вышли обновы и на пабликах могут играть до 30 человек,очень весело,но дизайн утраченный с 1 части растраивает.Да и локализация супер,озвучка шедевральна.8/10.

 So where do I even begin with this so called review? Left 4 Dead 2 is my most played game by a  large  margin. A  very large  margin. I enjoy the game, I do. Something always brings me back to it. It's got a charm that no other games seems to have for me. The lore, the characters, the locations. Most of them are fantastic, yes. With the help of modders and their handy mods, this is increased tenfold and it's  bloody  amazing. Then there's the community.  Now, if people are reading this, most of them would probably be shaking their heads in disgust at the word ""community""Yes, a large number of the Left 4 Dead 2 community, isn't really all that great. I could get into why but Im not going to get in to that. Find the right community however and pretty soon, Left 4 Dead 2 can become your own story.  I have made  friends , I have made  enemies  and I have even found someone who is  very special to me. There are downsides of course but whatever happens, I find myself coming back to this game. And I find myself thinking its more for the people than for the game itself. Don't get me wrong, I love the game too. So, if you're reading this and you're thinking of purchasing it, then please do. It should be a mandatory game with every Steam account. Dont be put off when you join a game and people start shouting and voting for you to be kicked. Take a breath, quit and try again cause I promise you, you'll find something to love with this game and with its community. You'll make friends and yes, you might make enemies too but then again, it'd be boring if someone didnt hate you, right?So to cut it short,  Yes  this game is what you want.  I do hope you enjoy your stay  "

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												Changing my review, still a thumbs up.This is a fun game to play, as long as you use common sense on some things. Like don't jump into a versus game when you barely know the maps. People are pretty kick friendly if you mess up too much. So practice with friends, or single player. If you get the basics but don't like single player then play easy or normal campaigns.Rushing in a advanced, realism, or versus game before you are ready will end up with just a lot of kicks and rage. I personally beat higher difficulty on single player before ever touching it online.(example: I beat advanced alone, before advanced online.)Still a great game, if you work as a team.			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 is a great game. I've had tons of hours of fun playing through campaigns and versus matches with my friends and still come back to play a round or two from time to time. It does however have some rather notable deficiencies the some important of which is, it's not that big of an upgrade from Left 4 Dead 1. Although the basic versus and campaigns play quite differently this is the result of new infected classes being added on rather than anything being changed, the result being that some of the older infected classes have become almost obsolete.Also something worth highlighting is Valve's inefficiency at fixing bugs. Several years into the game's life with almost weekly updates and Tanks still sometimes spawn outside of the map or on top of burning barrels.I guess my main criticism of Left 4 Dead 2 isn't that it's a bad game. It is that it's not a full game. It's a stand alone expansion pack and the fact that Valve charged full price is nothing short of a money grab.			"

												L4D2 is the ultimate zombie co-op game.Its not open world, but the maps are pretty big and the fun of playing with your friends cannot be measured by the size of a map. Everything is great, the zombies, the graphics, the fun factor and its not just limited to campaign maps, you can also play versus and scavenge modes which are great for teaming up with your friends and to get to know new people.´I highly recommend L4D2 to anyone i know, 10/10.

												Even though this game is over 4 years old it still holds up as being one of, if not THE best zombie game on the market. It's not only fun playing single player but it's hilarious when you can get three more friends to join in the zombie killing.There's of course the standard Easy - Hard difficulities (Here being Easy, Medium, Advanced and Expert). So if you're looking for some mindless slaughtering to do you can put it on easy or if you and your friends is a tatical squad preparing for the zombie apacolypse this is a great way to start!Also you don't have to play the first game to get into this one, all the maps and more from the first game is in this one. Even if you want to play oldschool there is a mode for that. Speaking of modes, there's Versus mode which is exactly what it sounds like, you control both the infected and the survivors in rounds. The one who ends the final map with the most points win. There is also a realism version of this mode which means the survivers can't see the green/orange/red glow around them as they used to.There's also Survival which is aslo what it sounds like. Survive for X amount of time and you get bronze, silver or a gold medal depending on the requirments for the map you're playing.Scavanger is the last major gamemode, here you play as survivor and infected and the objective is to fill a generator with gas. Who wins depends on which team's the fastest.Then, finally, there's something called mutation. These are pretty much fun little mini modes. For example you have to try and survive an entire campaign on your own, you and all your teamates have katanas and can't get other weapons, you need to carry around a lawngnome to win etc.			"

												-=-Hello! If anyone has read my reviews in the past, I'd just like to let you know that I follow a consistent pattern of playing at least 10 hours of any game I choose to review. So, without further ado, my Left 4 Dead 2 Review.-=-As many of you know, this game was made by Valve, shortly after Valve purchased Turtle Rock Studios, the developer of the first game. Now, Valve makes very great quality games, and if that doesn't interest you enough, I encourage you to continue reading my review.Now, I admit to not having finished the campain yet, but I've witnessed enough zombie slaughter to deem this game worthy of one of the best games I've played. This game is awesome; I've had fun slicing heads of zombies off with a fireaxe time and time again.This game was created in 2009, and the graphics, while cartoony, are very fantastic. The characters look amazing, the zombies look amazing, and hey, even the environment is eye-candy. The campaign is long, and I don't mean that in a bad way; each mission takes about 41 minutes long; and there's 9-10 levels. Each level, or chapter, is composed of 3-4 different areas, which you have to navigate through the zombie horde to reach a safehouse to end each segment. With the dark atmospheres and seemingly easy combat, you can sit back, relax, and shoot or slice your way through the zombies.The zombies are very well made; they're all creepy, and they're all wearing different clothes. This is one of the only zombie games I've played where everyone doesn't look like clones. With regular zombies, there's specialty zombies; Hazmats, who don't take fire damage, Chargers, who charge at you, Witches, who are one hit kill creatures that are extremely disturbing, Tanks, who take a hit and look pretty neat, Spitters, who launch poisonous goo at your team's feet,  and Boomers, which will blow up and blind your character; the blinding attracts other zombies which means the horde's now directed at you.The workshop mods are plentiful. Yes, this game does have a workshop, which makes the game that much more interesting. You can fight Teletubbies as Deadpool and Lara Croft. You can change Pills into Cola, and so on and so on. With the different survival maps you can download, the game may never be boring for survival lovers.Which leads me to my next point; survival. You don't have to do campaign mode all the time in Left 4 Dead 2, instead you can face large battles of horde after horde, trying to beat your team's best time. It adds a challenge to survival so that you have something to beat.Now for the breakdown:PROS:-Geniously Made (It's Valve: Duh)-Fantastic Graphics-Not that old of a game-Awesome enemies we can all learn to hate-Generous Replayability-Not a cheap ripoff of any gameCons:-Slight bugs; Zombies floating above cars a couple inches, etc, doesn't affect gameplay, just slightly distracting.9.5/10. Best game I've played in a long time.Also! There's Mods that can disable the profanity, turn the blood into paintball paint, etc, so if you were debating to purchase this game, there's mods for everything!!			"

												Before I even knew what Steam was, Left 4 Dead 1 and 2 were very popular games that I would play with my friends - back in our internet cafe days. I got this game gifted to me, and loved being able to add it to my collection.If you like the zombie-theme, fast-paced gameplay, cooperative chaos, superior mod support, and hours of endless fun, then you will thoroughly enjoy this game. The aesthetics are fantastic - the detail in the environment and character models is great, and the available mods add massive variety to most elements of the game. The music and sounds are very good and add a lot to the atmosphere. Each level set follows a particular story, allowing you to predict the gameplay with a few playthroughs. The controls are straightforward for your typical first-person shooter (FPS), and there is always feedback provided to help you remember the keys and things you can interact with. The learning curve is minimal to moderate, depending on your experience with FPS games. There are variants that ramp up the difficulty accordingly, if you are itching for more of a challenge.The mod support is where this game truly shines - it is just as seamlessly integrated as Space Engineers and Starbound. For example, in my game the zombies have been replaced with bone-chilling Teletubbies, and my 4 survivors consist of Harley Quinn (Batman series), James Bond (Pierce Brosnan), Wrex (Mass Effect series), and Scout (Team Fortress 2). I've also swapped out the ""special"" zombie with other skins. You can also mod things like weapons, game variants, taunts, etc. The possibilities are near-endless, allowing you to tailor your experience as you see fit.Overall, the gameplay is very fun, and cooperative play with friends maximizes the playability of L4D2. The AI is pretty decent (mods increase their effectiveness), but nothing beats fighting through hordes of zombies with real people. A key mechanic in the game is defending a point while some event (ex: an alarm while you wait for an elevator) causes a huge horde to rush you. There are also parts where you must deliver an item to a different location (while you hold the item you cannot attack), again while you are attracting zombies.  Special zombies like the Tank and Witch add extra danger to the levels, as you will need both planning and teamwork to take them down efficiently.If you haven't had a chance to try this game and are even the least bit interested, you really must give it a chance. I think it will be difficult to NOT enjoy L4D2. Definitely recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												The game of zombies, blood, and guts! But playing the game I find it has quite annoying side to having the infected run like super man at you in split seconds! but if your someone who enjoys a big group hug everywhere you walk, play this, you will feel the love of infected zombies wanting your autograph!

												Completely overrated game, just your average fps shoot em up gameplay with no real tactics or anything speical that seperates it from the rest, all this game is, is hype. The enemy bosses are some of the stupidest designs that offer 1 hit kills and are basically either easily killable or bullet sponges. The level design is generic, the graphics are nothing note worthy, the character dialogue is annoying every time they just repeat the same boring lines  that aren't funny nor creative. This game is not worth time or money I'm glad I only picked it up on sale for $5,00 cause this isn't even worth a penny.			"

												Do you dream of shooting Hilter or running in fear from the Koolaid man? This game is for you.  Join Bill, Zoey, Louis, Francis, and those other people that no one cares about through level driven campaigns that are randomly generated.  Shoot your way through mobs of fast zombies and other special infected zombies that look like stereotypical southern trash. You have the fatty, the redneck, they ""I'd ♥♥♥♥ my sister"" and the smoking uncle.  The game has a huge amount of content and a lot of replay ability, which is also how I describe my D**k to women.  There are lots of gamemode, but no one plays any of those but versus mode, which is full of try hards and people who have 1000+ hours making it cancer.Pros:Birds are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥br>Pills hereTank?Zoey's♥♥♥♥♥is flat, but is the only♥♥♥♥♥left on earth, so i'd probably tap itStairs?You can literally fight hilterYou can shoot the bots in the face and they will literally just stand there with a, ""So this is how it is huh."" look on their faceCons:Black stereotype always uses pillsBill taught me that smoking is cool and helps me fight zombiesZombies slap me and make me really slow, and I want to be not slowI thought I was only supposed to take 1 or 2 pills til I played this gameToo many vampiresConclusion:The game is full of content and randomly generated maps that will keep you in suspense as you are incapacitated on the ground while the bots just stare at you as you die.   Oh and praise bill he died for your sins.			"

												The only reason I don't recommend buying this gaming now because its filled with so many people who think they are the best and anybody who is new is horrible. It took me hours to even find a game that wouldn't kick me for being new. Gamers now seem to be very toxic and unwelcoming. That makes games that should be fun like this one horrible because you loose the enjoyment. If you are new to buying this I say dont go for it the community will treat you bad even though they should welcome you and let you have fun too			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 is THE game for online co-op first person shooting. And it never gets old, because you can vote; change the difficulty setting on the fly, or vote-kick that annoying team killer [which they are rare simply because they get vote-kicked lickety split.] Also you can visit www.l4dmaps.com and download user made content like Suicide Blitz, City 17, and I Hate Mountains! This game still gets regular updates and weekly mutations such as Chainsaw Masacre or Flu Season or The Four Swordsmen... all for the low low price of $0/month. If you want some co-op action without all the tedious grinding and boring leveling and repetitve end game content of an MMO, Left 4 Dead 2 here on steam is THE place to be. gl, hf, and gg!

I just cant get enough of this classic though I have to run through again most of the achievements I had before . Missin' my good old teammates as well.			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 is still the champion of killing all ""Sons of ♥♥♥♥♥es"".For me, L4D2 was far more enjoyable than L4D. The soundtrack, graphics, atmosphere, weapons, level design and humour were all perfect. I've played many zombie-killers, and nothing comes close to L4D2. A real pleasure to play both online and offline.When you consider how many hours ""good clean fun"" you get for your money; it's even more enjoyable. Top stuff.			"

												Amazing. I only got it a little while back, and I've got to say: out of all the zombie games I've tried out, Left 4 Dead 2 seems the most promising. Best 20 bucks ever spent. One of the best parts about L4D2 are the add-on maps like Tank Challenge. Basically, if you don't have Left 4 Dead 2 already, something's wrong with you. "

												Left 4 Dead, in my opinion, is one of the few games that deserves a 10 out of 10. For what it is trying to do, it achieves it perfectly. This is the quiescental fast paced zombie survival game. Each of the campaigns have almost an infinite replay value, with a multitude of modifiers. Survival mode is addicting, and versus is unique and awesome. In versus, you can play as the infected, and try to hunt down the survivors. I have played this for 50 hours on steam, and hundreds more on consoles, and I still love it. Get this game.Pros:+Everything (One of the only games I consider to be perfect)Overall: 10/10 The perfect zombie Coop game, get it now.			"

												Left for dead 2OH WOWWhere do I start with this amazing game.Well,let's start with the basics,Left for dead 2,or l4d2 for short,is the sequal to yet another amazing game l4d.This pits the charactersCoachA Varsity football coach who is like the team pep-cheerleader. Giving the team encouraging words whenever they are incacpitated or ''hurt''. He also acts like the team leader. He is very good at keeping the teams level-headed.RochelleThe most hated character of l4d2 for a lot of people for no apparent reason. Rochelle was a news worker who has to deal with Ellis,another character who is in love with her.EllisAs said before Ellis is in love with Rochelle. Ellis is like a texan who has a friend named Keith that he talks about so and so. He is like the clown of the group,giving them a good laugh sometimes.NickNick is a drug dealer.'Nuff said.But in all honesty Nick is the grump of the group. He was a con artist but he doesn't have as much known about him as everyone else.The new infected.From memory they added the SpitterThe spitter spits acid (Hence the name Spitter) Which can damage survivors and wittle down their health.ChargerThe charger is like the powerhouse of the infected. Able to charge a survivor and pummel them into seperate concrete areas.And there is the Jockey who when he jumps on your head can lead the survivor to different places,they can attempt to resist it but it nearly never walks. When they are Jockeyed they can lead them into a instant death charger area,spitters's spit or a instant witch.The game l4d2 is as good,dare I say it, better then it's first game. I believe the characters have more colour in there backstory and aren't just talking about the apocolypse but stuff that they remember and stuff about backstory.There are the Uncommen infected who basically are infected who are uncommen,I know.Amazing,anyway There is the CEDA Worker Infected who are immune to bile bombs. The Jimmy Gibsh Juinor infected,Fallen survivor who carries different supplies and drops them when killed. Clown infected,worker infected,and the riot infected.l4d2s' community could be better,so that's a dent in what is a perfect game otherwise.l4d2 9/10As I said before,the community could be better.I will add the different modes and more detail later as I have to go now.

												I had a lot of fun playing this game although I do not take it much seriously (if any at all) but of course I votekick those who just ruin the game or do not play as intended but never had issues if someone or even the entire team has low skill level as I do not play for win, just play to have fun so even when we lost but everyone tried was satisfactory for me. I haven't played it since quite some time and I heard the playerbase now is horrible, unforgiving and ruthless so consider this when you plan to play it and if you can gather a group of friends to play with instead of going alone or with just one friend. I mostly played public games alone back then and had only a slight amount of issues with trolls and tryhards so it was okay at that time but things have changed a lot (to the worse) according to my sources so if that is a concern to you be prepared or just play another game.

If you're still in the mood to group up with friends and slay packs of ravenous undead, then it doesn't get any better than this.It's entirely possible you're someone who never played the first and have no idea what I'm talking about, so I'll take a step back for a moment. It's the zombie apocalypse, and you play as one of four human Survivors who attempt to shoot their way through hordes of fast-moving ""infected"" to get to the end of a map.it`s one of the best zombies games out there,what are you waiting?buy it!it awesome			"

												Putting it into a simple way, L4D2 gives you countless hours of gameplay. You can download content make the game even better, for example. You can literally turn zombies into flesh eating Teletubbies. Multiplayer is filled with adrenaline, from Co-op to Versus. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to have a great time killin' zombos with friends. "

												Well, just about the best Zombie killing game ever!  I did enjoy L4D, and when this version game out, I was hooked.  Okay for total noobs and challenging for those who can survive Expert Realism.  Mutations and new maps keep the environments fresh and creepy, and though there are plenty of haters in the world, you can still meet pretty cool people from all over the planet, trying to have a good time in the midst of the apocalypse.  Excellent.			"

												One of my favorite games just for a quick round of playing, you can have fun with other people, get good enough on a strategy level to compensate even if your aim isn't the best, and don't have to commit too much time to it.  Also, there's a healthy modding community with Steam Workshop, you can just press a single button and change up your game so, say, Daryl Dixon from Walking Dead or some other character is one of your four survivors.

												Following on from the success of the hit zombie game Left4Dead 1 this was destined to be another smash for Valve. It is more of the same zombie killing except with new maps, New Special Zombies and even more and new weapons. Over all a great game.Some things are not what I would have wanted ie.Hunter controls/physics etc but I will still give it a  8/10...oh! and with more great game mode for you to challenge your self with your friends on.

												This game is a fast paced action arcade shooter with some personality. It isn't a survival horror game, really, it's more of a game to play one match and then move on to something else. The whole game is pretty standard, the only thing that really is superb is the characterization of the protagonists. Each character is unique and has their own personality. The enemy types are quite unique in their own way, but I'm pretty sure there are other games with the same enemy types out there. The mod support is great, you can be a character from My Little Pony beating the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of Daleks from Doctor Who with a Lightsaber, it really is something to admire. It's a lot more fun when you play with people you know. 7/10			"

And if the official content is not enough for you, there are dozens of fan-made workshop maps, campaigns, weapons, skins, etc. Awesome games, I can only recommend it.			"

												One of the greatest co-op experiences I've ever had the pleasure to play. If you're even remotely interested in cooperative games, post-apocalyptic settings, or something as simple as a solid and fun FPS, you can't go wrong with Left 4 Dead 2.First off, the gameplay: in a word, it's fantastic. You can play a variety of gamemodes including Campaign (humans against AI), Versus (humans against humans), Survival, and more. So whether you're the competitive or the casual type, there's a gamemode for you. Playing as a survivor, the guns feel great, killing zombies feels satisfying, and the need for teamwork is an absolute must. As an infected, the zombies feel unique, isolating survivors feels satisfying, and the need for teamwork is an absolute must. Without going in to too much detail, this really is co-op at its finest.On the other side of the coin, there is little-to-no story to speak of, so don't go in expecting a plot. You can, however, count on a diverse cast of memorable characters. Valve managed to create distinguished and vibrant personalities of the game's eight playable protagonists from nothing but simple back-and-forth dialogue and banter. It keeps things fresh, interesting, and humorous, even after 700 hours of gametime.Left 4 Dead 2 easily stands as one of my favorite multiplayer games of all time.			"

												Like the first, this one also didn't leave us disappointed. Left 4 Dead was able to do alot, but still it had many limitations. In this one, most, if not all are filled. More weapons (melee weapons!), more zombie types, more zombies, more gore, more fun. Better graphics and psychics and so on. Left 4 Dead 2 is an absolutely perfect zombie game and there is no reason you shouldn't try it.10/10			"

												I love playing this game. This is the best zombie game, besides Call of Duty: World at War, Black Ops, and Black Ops II Zombies, and The House/Typing of the Dead: Overkill. When I first played this game I thought it was a terrible, boring game, but once you keep playing, then you'll realize that especially with your friends, this is a very fun game to play. Still boring? Well, then go mod your game with Steam Workshop items, like maps, character skins, camos, other weapons and sounds as well! This is worth the $19.99, but I recommend waiting till' Christmas becuase on Christmas they give this game for FREE, which I did. Anyway, if you don't have the game, grab a copy, and also try to gift copies of the game to friends that don't have it!! Enjoy this game now, and you won't regret it! PS: DO NOT get Left 4 Dead 1. ALL Left 4 Dead 1 campaigns are in Left 4 Dead 2.			"

												Grab some friends and settle in for one of the all-time great co-op games. While this game can be played alone or with random strangers on the internet, you're only going to get the full experience playing with 3 friends. On top of that some sort of voice communication is crucial, whether it's in-game voice chat or playing in the same room. You fight through waves of zombies, interspersed with tougher ""special"" infected, trying to reach a series of safe houses and eventually escape. Along the way you'll have to complete occasional specific objectives, most commonly fetch quests and wave defense/horde mode. You'll skimp on ammo and hunt for med-kits. You'll try to not wake the Witch. You'll wake the Witch. You'll fail, formulate new strategies, and tweak those again. It's all of this that makes your final escape so exhilarating and fulfilling.On top of the great co-op campaign levels you also get co-operative and versus multiplayer modes. Of course you have your basic horde mode but really intriguing are the versus modes where teams switch back and forth between playing the survivors and the infected. When playing as an infected you spawn as a different ""special"" infected, with it's special abilities and attacks, each life and try to stop the survivors from progressing through a stage or collecting gas cans to power a generator. Surviving with your friends is awesome, sending them to the moon as a Charger is hilarious. Extending the life of this title even more is the extensive Steam Workshop support. From simple visual changes and user maps to complete overhauls and re-skins, you should be able to find plenty of content to extend your playtime.If you have a few friends to play this with then it's absolutely worth the price, on-sale or not. If you're a lone wolf then you'll probably want to pass (playing alone isn't really that great) or make some friends.			"

												I had a lot of fun playing this game although I do not take it much seriously (if any at all) but of course I votekick those who just ruin the game or do not play as intended but never had issues if someone or even the entire team has low skill level as I do not play for win, just play to have fun so even when we lost but everyone tried was satisfactory for me. I haven't played it since quite some time and I heard the playerbase now is horrible, unforgiving and ruthless so consider this when you plan to play it and if you can gather a group of friends to play with instead of going alone or with just one friend. I mostly played public games alone back then and had only a slight amount of issues with trolls and tryhards so it was okay at that time but things have changed a lot (to the worse) according to my sources so if that is a concern to you be prepared or just play another game.

												First off, I'm gonna be honest with this. There is alot wrong with this game. Infact, there is some stuff in this game that if you saw it, it'd make you just say ""What in the ♥♥♥♥ were they thinking?"". However, these things don't ruin the game, L4D2 is actually a very fun and addictive game with a huge amount of customization thanks to community made addons and mods. As I mentioned before, there are alot of bugs in this game, but the majority of them have had community made fixes, so that isn't too big of a problem, but it is still very lazy of valve to not fix these blatant bugs themselves. Over all, left 4 dead 2 is a very fun game that will definitely keep you from getting bored.			"

												This is a fantastic zombie based game. There are numerous con's to this game, like hacked or nodded lobbies that ruin the game IMO. And simply people that troll just a toxic community, but what game doesn't have that? Besides it being repetitive its a lot more fun with friends. There are a lot more pros such as destroying people with your friends or very rarely unless your♥♥♥♥♥♥vice versa. Lmao. There are configs in l4d2. Which allow you to participate in ""promod"" it's a style of vs that makes the game more challenging for survivors. Not just rush to saferoom deal. You are restricted to T1 only and pills. Mollies and pipe bombs and boomer biles are just more uncommon to find. It makes the game more intense the higher tiers you go up, steam groups are how you get into promod servers. Or you can join off of a friend that's in a good. All together if you see this game on sale. I highly reccomend it especially if you enjoy FPS that have some strategy especially if you play with friends or people that aren't as toxic as the community. 10/10 have bought this game twice. Worth it. All the way.			"

												One of my favorite games. This game is extremely entertaining and it involves people to work as a team, rather than individuals. Helps with team building and trust in others. Extremely good graphics and gameplay.The only minor things I dislike about this game is that the Infected (Common and Special) seem a little ""toned down"". It'd be nice is they were a lot more vicious and caused more damage, even on Normal and Easy difficulties.Overall, this is one of the best games I've ever played.			"

												left 4 dead 2 is a game I recommend with its ground breaking side scrolling and its 3d open world puzzle adventure rhythm plat forming game play it's easy to see why most people don't have enough blast processing to handle its 8-bit graphics if you got money and need a new game for your Nintendo 720 I suggest you buy left 4 dead to as it will most likely be the best game on the Atari 2600			"

												This game is good in and of itself but I would only suggest you play the co-op mode with people you know.  9 times out of 10, you put 1 pinky toe wrong and you can expect to get kicked and sent back to the title screen.  This is probably true of most online games, but this one especially since there is no kind of moderation in the online play.  If you wanna play through the story with some friends, by all means pick this up, but I'd suggest you avoid the online pvp modes unless you are extremely patient, or have some kind of aiming assisting tool.

												Like the first, this one also didn't leave us disappointed. Left 4 Dead was able to do alot, but still it had many limitations. In this one, most, if not all are filled. More weapons (melee weapons!), more zombie types, more zombies, more gore, more fun. Better graphics and psychics and so on. Left 4 Dead 2 is an absolutely perfect zombie game and there is no reason you shouldn't try it.10/10			"

												Думаю лучшая зомби-игра современности, а ещё замечательный кооперативный шутер. Окунись в атмосферу зомби-апокалипсиса(который здесь очень реалистично показан)именно в этой игре очень точно работает принцип ""Один в поле не воин"" поэтому будь по ближе к товарищам и гляди в оба...Они по всюду.

												I love playing this game. This is the best zombie game, besides Call of Duty: World at War, Black Ops, and Black Ops II Zombies, and The House/Typing of the Dead: Overkill. When I first played this game I thought it was a terrible, boring game, but once you keep playing, then you'll realize that especially with your friends, this is a very fun game to play. Still boring? Well, then go mod your game with Steam Workshop items, like maps, character skins, camos, other weapons and sounds as well! This is worth the $19.99, but I recommend waiting till' Christmas becuase on Christmas they give this game for FREE, which I did. Anyway, if you don't have the game, grab a copy, and also try to gift copies of the game to friends that don't have it!! Enjoy this game now, and you won't regret it! PS: DO NOT get Left 4 Dead 1. ALL Left 4 Dead 1 campaigns are in Left 4 Dead 2.			"
