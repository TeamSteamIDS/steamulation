												A lot of discussions have been going on about Krater. While some players praise the fresh rpg setting and the challenging quests, others critisize the imbalanced powers of the monsters.Here is what I experienced:Pros:- easy to get started, self-explanatory game mechanics, well-made learning curve- a solid story about abusing power, elite leaders and supressing the masses, set in a post-nuclear Sweden, with a good sense of humour- long-time motivation for those who love challenges, as there are perfect builds to find, the limbo (a 45-level-dungeon) to raid etc.- Nice graphic style, clean and fitting sounds and soundtrackCons:- Disastrous balancing: Some enemies are way too weak, others will bring your team down in no time. It takes a lot of time to find a good build for the final battle - but it does not depend on your own skill, but more on puzzling together different boosters (that improve strength, defense, stamina etc)- Boring quests, standard rpg loot & collect tasks- The coop mode is only three levels - well, for a game that calls itself a coop game, it's sparse, to put it mildlyIn the first ten hours of playing, I was about to tell friends to try out the game, as it had this fresh setting and things went on pretty well, absolving quests and looting dungeons. But then I was stuck more often due to strong enemies, no money to buy upgrades, and misspent boosters. The final battle got pretty frustrating as I did not find a build good enough to beat the final boss. Also, until today, I never found a single player in the coop lounge to join a game.Concerning that, I would not recommend to buy this game until one is going for a challenging rpg.			"

												Krater is a game which can neither be wholly dismissed nor whole-heartedly embraced. The tactical team-based RTS/ARPG hybrid battle-system is exciting, innovative, and well-implemented, while various tweaks to the typical ARPG formula show the thoughtfulness of passionate game design.  The graphic design is consistent and thematically appropriate throughout. Sadly, Krater plays like a concept demo - a few hours of fun as you acclimate to the control scheme and unique design elements, followed by a steep drop-off in variety. The crafting system is essentially a grinding-incentiviser, and character progression is bizarrely limited in ways which are obviously designed to conjure up more grindplay. While the four classes do allow for some interesting combinations and teamwork, each class has only two skills. Although these skills can be tweaked in a variety of ways thanks to the unique augmentation system, the actual gameplay is largely unaffected by these tweaks and runs together in a wash of habitual button-mashing. In many ways Krater succeeds - the writing is quirky, the world interesting, and the graphics stimulating. Unfortunately at the core of it all is an exceedingly repetitious experience. If your love for grinding or your desire to explore outweigh your distaste for repetitive gameplay, there is a unique and rewarding experience to discover here. Otherwise, avoid investing yourself in Krater: its innovation is only skin deep. "

												This is one of those ""maybe"" games but I'm erring to ""Not Recommended"" just so people are aware of the issues it has.Most obvious - it's clear they intended this game to be large or even multi-part story but that never happened so it doesn't feel like a completed thing as-is - that doesn't mean it's not fun at times, it just means it's not ""all of a piece"".I've had issues around alt-tab since Beta and they're STILL THERE even now.  Alt-tabbing will almost certainly leave the game in an immovable/hard-to-interact-with window - it may cause the game to just stop responding entirely - it's almost never a good idea to do it.Saving is limited - you always restart from the nearest quest hub - and I've lost progress after a hang/crash a few times - I've lost progress after exitting properly a few times too - add that to it's dislike of alt-tab and you have a recipe for frustration which has led to me stop playing more-than-once.Difficulty varies WILDLY - you'll spend a lot of time doing really easy stuff and then hit something REALLY hard - often just a random mob which is super-tough or whatever - it clearly needed more polishing.All of that is a real shame because I like the setting, music, voicework, concept, playstyle, itemisation - it had a tonne of potential and ever time I come back to it I enjoy it for a while before I hit yet another pothole/crash and quit again!tl;dr lovely idea about half polished/finished and just a bit too crashy to recommend as-is.

												With a broken heart i do not recommend this game.It had the potential to be a better title than borderlands.It had great setting, exceptional soundtrack, humour and story.And then... everything just froze. And we have another example thatbacking early access doesn't always pay off. Or should I say 'rarely pays off'?It's an unfinished game that most probably will never be finished. As of now (2015) i'd say it's stuck not even halfway.I tried launching it after almost two years. Thought that I'd just play it for a moment and spill a tear or two.Now it crashes even before the tutorial. "

												3 out of 10I stopped playing this game still far from finishing.  Hence the thumbs down.  It seems like a lot of development went into the basic world design and not enough into specific character, combat, quest and dungeon design.  This makes the game very repetitive. This is a top down RPG where you control a bunch of characters in a post apocalyptic world. The good: 1. Quite nice basic design.  It had a lot of potential. 2. It seems like the game is huge.  Which is also a bad thing considering the simplicity of the combat system - you will get bored sooner or later. The bad: 3. Character development is very simplistic.  Each character has 2 skills.  Forever! 4. Extremely repetitive action. The ugly: 5. You have to pay to enable you to develop your characters past a certain level.  Really irritating. 6. If you die (a lot on medium) you have to trudge all the way back from town through it all to where you died.  Some sort of fast travel system would have made a world of difference.			"

												Sounds like a neat idea, the setting is something new, gameplay seems like a stripped-down single-player MMO.  The weapon names are amusing, and upgrade options look like they could give some surprising depth.  But the controls are absolutely abysmal.  The game can't even figure out where the mouse is half the time, and exactly how far off it is varies enough that you can't compensate for the error.  Even if, by sheer blind dumb luck, you manage to find the right place to click, the game frequently refuses to recognize input for no readily apparent reason.  So in summary it's a good idea for a game but so badly coded that it's basically unplayable.  I'm lucky I got this in a bundle, I don't recommend paying for it.			"

												In the beginning, the game seemed like it was different. A lot of crafting, quests, and plenty of loot, but that was it. Midway through the game, nothing was worth crafting. Maybe a few upgrades here and there, but the ingredients for those were so rare, I'd barely ever craft anything. All the quests ended up being the same, kill enemies for drops and the defeat a boss. The loot, horrible. I think the whole point of picking anything up was just to sell to afford some of the ingredients for the off chance that you I something to craft. I've only obtained one epic and everything else was just vendor trash.The dungeons, they're ALL THE SAME. Yes, there are randomized elements per playthrough, but imagine playing Diablo 1 and you just kep going down the church level for 40+ levels. No thanks...4/10 - Not looking forward to the sequel if it happens.			"

My perk was never fulfilled, and they barely had any support. There were multiple different tiers of backing, including one for 10,000$. This company is among the most dishonest in the business.

												I've bought Krater as Early Access. And I can tell you that this game was one of the reasons why I am now completely cured of this Early Access. It looked promising, so promising in fact that I bought the unfinished product, even if this kind of game is not my cup of tea. Oh boy, was I disappointed.I will not speak about game mechanics, since there are already enough well written reviews covering that up. I will only tell why you should not buy this game, not matter how cheap it is sold in the next sale.Krater is pretty much in the same unfinished shape than the Eary Access version. The devs fixed some smaller things, forcing me to start over and over again, because everytime the update broke my save games. It still crashes, it still has problems with the webcode. But to me and other players one of the biggest problems of the game is the tiny font. As in ""You need the Hubble telescope to read things"" tiny. You can barely read item descriptions and crafting becomes a nice game of ""squint & guess"". People were complaining about this since the beta, but the devs just give a crap.This game was already abandoned shortly after its release. The tiny font thing was never adressed, most of the bugs were never adressed. They released a single player character for 6 €, cashed in an went off to never look back.Sadly, with a bit more work Krater could have earned a recommendation easily. It has charm, a great soundtrack, tons of fun loot, a nice crafting system and a great soundtrack. It even looks nice. Unfortunately the devs decided to leave this game alone and, considering Kraters still unfinished state, you should too.			"

YouTube™ Video: 60 Second Reviews: Krater 

			Views: 1,603		

			Krater is an indie top-down action RPG developed and published by Fatshark. They try to add their own original spin to many conventional features of the genre, but ultimately they gave it loads of...		

Krater is a top down Action RPG similar to games such as Torchlight and Diablo. The thing that seperates it from those games is that instead of controlling 1 character, you'll be controlling a squad of three of them. Oh, and it's set in Sweden.You navigate the game via a HUGE overworld map similar to games like Final Fantasy VII. You can expect random encounters to spice up your journeys and this is actually a really cool feature of the game. One suprising thing is, despite the huge world, levels load in really quickly.However, not all is good. Moving onto the combat - the combat was simply such a huge disappointment for me. It's so basic and the abilities cool down so fast, you'd think the game was set in Antarctica. Literally, every single battle just felt like I was playing guitar hero with the number keys in order to win.Speaking of abilities, you'd think an action RPG on this scale has hundreds of them, right? Well I'll tell you now that there are 4 different classes in this game and how many abilities does each class have? Two. Yep, that's right: Two.Being a game where about 80% of the time you'll be fighting, the combat system just makes it fall flat on it's face. There are plenty of other features like a confusing crafting system and permadeath party system, but they pretty much go unnoticed because of how terrible the rest of the game is.I wanted to like this game, but all the potential it had has just gone at the window, leaving it with a 3 out of 10.

It really feels like this is 1 quarter of the promised game sloppily put together to just have something to sell to people who thought it would be a cool game.So I would not get this game if I know about this in advanced and I urge everyone to not buy it becasue it's not very good.Score: 1/5			"

												Promised features have never been implemented. Bugs and known issues prevail to this day.Content has been cut and watered down due the developer's lack of skill to tackle problems with their own engine. At one point the game was just discontinuedand never been spoken of again. If that doesn't scare you off, you have moneyto burn or your time isn't of much worth to you. Then you still might find somethingin Krater. You could maybe embrace it as a work of art. Marvel at a concept that never came together, but had some spirit behind it. The looks can be deceiving,as their is some visual beauty and even a splendid soundtrack. The parts justdon't succeed in coming together and forming an enjoyable experience. To this day Fatshark stays a burned name for me. I'm sorry for Vermintide,as I am a friend of Warhammer. But I'd even go as far as, not for free.Not even if you pay me. I'm done burning my time in the 'hopes',that at some point enjoyment will be derived from a game.Or any other product, as you will. Like with a bad book.You don't have to finish it. And you don't have to give theauthor another chance. Other people can do that. Of course nobody stops you to. You're the boss of you. "

												Krater is a isometric strategic action RPG where you control a group of three in search of riches and loot. The combat is real time, so you cannot pause mid fight to issue commands, this makes the game rather hectic and death can be permanent or result in serious unerasable injuries which gives combat a fun flight or fight feeling.It has co-op but only through short mission like scenarios, which always end too soon. Kind of lame they released it with the promise of co-op only to make us wait several months for a watered down version. If you enjoy diablo, baulders gate, or torchlight, you should give this game a chance			"

												The game that could have been. Krater is kind of like an RPG with characters you can hire and replace. You can equip them with things that will make there stats go up. Stamina, more life more healing. However for whatever reason they did things backwards  and some things are just broken for the stats. Instead of focusing in on fun gameplay and fixing things they decided to add harder enemies? Why I have no idea. They eventually added co op however its not the main game only a few special dungeons.  I bought this game because of the co op that was promised and half delivered. The game wants to be like dragons age however there is no easy way to do that and often times most of your healers guys will try to get into melee range. Great. A mess of a game. So many things wrong with it and never fixed. Sad because the graphics and sound effects are great however Gameplay lets it down so much. Also the loot in the game is scarce and doesnt change that much. I doubt we will ever see another Krater 2. Might be for the best really.			"

												I feel bad for KraterYou don't have to be good at RPG's or even played Krater as a whole game to notice that it has some great missed potentials.It just makes me sad to see it there on my desktop catching dust never having been played again after four tries. But I am not gonna let you stay in the dark about why it's that way;point 1 - the freedom you get from itIn Krater, you have the freedom to pick from 4 different classes, build a team out of them however it pleases you, change the loadout of your characters and get to explore an everchanging postapocalyptic version of what seems to be Sweden.Now in seriousness: Some classes are just obviously overpowered compared to others (slayer to regulator) You have eight and I am not joking here, EIGHT different skills to chose from in the entire game. Each class has two available and the teams you build can have three characters maximum. Now to the loadout. Every character has two slots in the inventory. One for a weapons and one for a gadget. Each weapon can only be used by one class and they normaly differ from one another like some flowerpots.And finally the map: Instant traveling to a point on the map is not only a thing required to get from one end of the game to another, it's also slow as hell because you get to see a little blinky ping representing your team going wherever you told it to on the map in a speed that makes you wonder if a one-legged pensioner taking his dead pet slug for a walk would be this slow. Also the stages are either so small one could call them 'tight' or are equaly tight tunnel systems which seamingly end up in postapocalyptic Russia. Point 2 - AtmosphereIt is obvious that a lot of love went into the graphical developement of Krater but there are still some things that just get annoying over time; NPC's mainly looking alike, a nonexistant plot and the ...ugh... music.Whith 'a nonexistant plot' I just want to underline that the game starts with all your characters being kicked out of a town which they seem to have drunkenly terrorised and joining some kind of mercenary force which operates all over Krater. BAM raiders, freediggers, wildlife, reference to a country which cannot totaly be a reference to Germany in of itself ....WHAT?! why is everyone having bears and mooses in ther cellars? Why am I fighting people who dig holes into their own estates? Oh wait... I am not fighting them? And why do i still not know any main villain? AND WHY HAS EVERYONE BECOME PYRO?! (ok the last one was unnecessary)Last point was also listing the music... Well, this is what disappointed me the most about the game; there are 18 tracks in this game which are used mainly as themes for the different places, but why do 16 of them sound almost the same?! I literaly tried to memorize them as different songs with all their individualities but still: 16 of them sound like one giant synthetic smooth jazz remix, one is a rock song and one is medieval fair music, but you have practicaly no chance whatsoever to tell the first bunch ones apart! I wish they had put some more diverse tracks into this game. The atmosphere is just depressing if every place sounds the same! And I mean the bad kind of depressing. Also the music is nothing special. Not only is the sound of it never changing, it's not even good.Although it's a failure in my eyes as well as a waste of money I just can't stop myself from feeling pitty for it.Thanks for reading.

												Krater, a ARPG, that looks promising, innovative and fun on the outside. But deep inside, it´s nothing more than a mediocre RPG with poor pacing, a tiring combat-system and frustrating level-processing. Story After a nuclear war scoured the world, many survivalists try to make the best out of their situation: either by being a reputable citizen, by doing dubious job for mysterious organisations or by scavenge the treasures of the Crater and revealing it´s secrets.You, the player, is trying to do the latter of the options, whilst controlling a team of three gas-masked survivalists to accomplish your final goal. Gameplay Although the game claims to be a strategic ARPG, it´s nothing more than a simple hack&slash one.As I mentioned before, you control a team consiting of three survivors, each of them have their own unique skills.Whilst only being able to play three survivors at the same time, you can choose from four different classes and rearrange your team based on them.The four classes are: - The Bruiser --> Your typical tank, that operates as a shield for your team                                - The Slayer --> The assassine-ish class, that is able to hack it´s way through                                                   entire enemy hordes                                - The Medic -->  He heals your team, duh.                                - The Regutator --> Because of his stuns and slows, he is irreplaceable for the                                  late part of the gameEvery character has two unique skills.....that´s it. They won´t obtain any new skills by leveling them up, which brings me to the next point:  The leveling system The games level-cap is 15, but your characters will start with level caps of 5.You can unlock the next (overpriced) level cap by visiting a boot-camp and purchasing the said upgrade.Because of the fact, that you have to purchase them, you spend a significant amount of time not earning any experience points and every fight seems to be nothing less than a time waste.By reaching the next level of your character, you unlock slots for implants and boosters.While these upgrades aren´t as important in the early game as they should be, their bonuses are more than important for the later parts of the game.It´s a shame that you can´t remove already operated upgrades. The only way to bypass this problem is to place the new booster/implants on the already taken slots without getting some sort of a refund for the lost one. Graphics There is nothing much to say about it seriously.They are pretty on some occasions (dungeouns, cities, characters, monsters), but more then outdated in other aspects of the game (skills, world map).Blinking pools of blood, flickering textures aren´t a big deal at all, since they won´t happen very often.The underwhelming distance rendering on the world map downgrades the experience of travels. Level-Design & Enemies If you have seen one location/enemy,  you have seen them all.This point is a very important one, because after playing this game for nearly 23 hours, I´ve grown tired of all the same looking enemy, the same looking cities, villages and dungeous.Every city, village and dungeoun looks and feels the same.You don´t grow attached to the locations or the people and after visiting 5 similar looking towns, you scratch you head and start thinking whether you run in circles and entering the one you´ve just left.The same is for the enemy types. There is no variety whatsoever.If I explore a dungeoun on the west side of the world map, I´ll encounter the same generic looking enemy as I would in a dungeon that´s located on the east side of the world map.After defeating the same survivor/bear/hound for the 200th time, you´ll grow tired of it. Pro/Contra+ humorous dialogs+ post-apocalyptic setting+ big world to discover+ CO-OP------------------------------ generic location-designs- generic enemy-designs- only two skills for every character- purchasable level-caps- level-cap of 15- gathering exp-points mostly time waste- repetitive combat-system- poor pacingSummaryIf you try to see past the countless flaws of the game, you´ll be greeted with a mediocre, yet sometimes fun game, that sadly isn´t able to distinguish itself from all the other, better ARPG out there.

												I was both happy and disappointed by this game. If you are looking for a fullfilling single player top down hack and slash with some rpg and strategy, then this will do. However if you wanted this for co-op. forget about it. They released a ""co-op"" Krater update that put the word ""co-op"" to shame. There is no co-op story gameplay.

												Krater looks really good on paper. Post-apocalyptic Sweden where everything is made out of scrap and IKEA furniture. However, the reality is weak plot, dump characters and mediocre (at best) gameplay.  I don’t understand RPG elements in this game. There is no explanation what I should level up and why. Just stay away from this game.			"

												Overall not a bad game. A nice amount of customizing, both via implants & skill addons. Game is pretty challenging but it feels like some of that is due to it being a Real Time squad game without pause. Sometimes you just can't grab aggro off your healer fast enough to keep him alive and the fight is over after that. Even with hotkeys and shortcuts when I lose fights its often because of this rather than biting off more than I could chew			"

												Krater is a game I really want to like, although it has some shortcomings. First, the postitives:+ post-apocalyptic, yet ""fresh"" setting (a krater in future Sweden)+ nice art style+ doesn't take itself too serious (also some nice pop-cultural references)+ very cool system to modify skills and chars (via boosts/implants)+ crafting system+ ""meaty"" crits and nice fx+ teleport to world map from everywhere+ good loot is scarce (a plus in my book)+ great name generatorNow the not-so-positives:- booooring dungeons (only a few tile sets and it gets repetitive fast), almost no interactive objects or surprises and only a few rare special bosses- much back-tracking if you want to explore the whole map- opponents are just static groups in regular intervals in the dungeons - not much tactic involved, more like button-smashing- chars aren't really unique (with the exception of the DLC chars), they are randomly assembled and you can hire them in many towns- chars have limited levels, which you can expand with money to a max of lvl 15 (which you can reach in maybe 2h per char), after that there is no char evolution other than gear/implantsThat being said, this game would have had huge potential. Better maps and more interesting battles would have helped much. It just feels too generic as is.Imo, the best thing would have been, if the game had had turn-based or rtwp-combat with a deeper skill system. I'm sure it would have been a  (indie) success with that.I'm giving this a thumbs-up, although the devs didn't realize the potential of the game. So far I have fun. Don't know if I will finish it though... "

But this Shark who build Krater, just released unfinished and unsupported game to get money from players. Now it is rich, too rich to become Fatshark, it completely forget game to work on another projects. It's shame because game have great potential.So, i ask to you to STOP to support any Fatshark project now. This is how on Steam we can get Justice about bad devs/studios.			"

												What started off as a reasonably enjoyable action RPG with an offbeat setting and the potential for interesting combat mechanics eventually came around to repetitive number key mashing and not caring about the character progression as it seemed to cap out at level 15 with over half of the map still un-explored.I would recommend the developer shorten the game time, add some more customisation to the character setup, and add a reason to keep playing beyond level cap (ideally increasing the level cap and strengthening the reason for character progression in the first place).  I was enjoying this game for the first few hours but after 20 or so hours - the same mechanics with little to no customisation to them does get quite old.I wanted to like this game, I really did.  I'm an indie darling, I'll always give indie games a bit more of a shot but I cannot recommend anything beyond the first few hours of this game.5/10			"

												Basically an MMO where you control Tank, DD and Healer yourself. Each one of which have 2 abilities which makes for boring combat imho. It's MMO-esque right down to the basically meaningless dialogue, the question marks and exclamatioon points above the heads of quest givers, weapons that come in grey, green and blue and the tons of useless loot that clutter up your inventory.The art style is nice and if you're looking for a RPG-title you can sink a few hours in, go right ahead, but I would recommed waiting for a sale.

Review for solo-play :This could have been a great game, but they missed that by miles away (see Tank/Healer/Damage Dealers section).It could have been a good game, but they also missed that by having a highly monotonous combat, with only 2 abilities for each of your 3 characters that you just spam when they're available, plus 1 item per character with a long cooldown which makes it usually nearly useless.It could have been a decent game, like other Action RPGs where you just smash things mostly mindlessly, but the crashes, the lack of polishing and the final boss designed to make you grind even more came in the way.Tank/Healer/Damage Dealers:Although this game features the triptych Tank/Healer/Dps, it barely uses it : most enemies don't do enough damage so you can play 90% of the game without a healer. Healing is only useful against the rare big mobs, and you automatically get all your health back at end of each fight. So at 1st, having a healer just slows you down as you make less dps than with having a Damage Dealer instead.Tanking isn't much better, as there's no aggro building nor threat management, only an AoE taunt that lasts a few seconds, so the damage dealer always gets attacked. Moreover, the tanking ability of the tank isn't much above the damage dealers' one : you can boost the defense attribute of your tank to easily reach 60-65% damage mitigation instead of the 50% of the damage dealers, but after that, raising the defense doesn't raise much anymore the damage mitigation so it's a waste, as it's much more efficient to just invest in Health & Damage.Plus there's no active pause, only 2 abilities per characters, and almost all the mobs act the same and the ones who don't usually don't alter the way to fight, so there's no tactic nor strategy involvement in the combat. The only thing to know to prevail is to understand how to use implants and ability boosters to raise the health and the damage output of our characters and it's done.Pros :- Decent playability, we're not too far from Diablo 3 & Torchlight 2, but it's even more a mindless click-feast and almost no thinking will be needed to beat the game- Kinda open-world, although it doesn't bring much as going to the hard zones too early means death and going back to easy zones later on means no interesting loot nor money- Crafting is kinda ok, but as often in this kind of game, it's pretty limited as it requires a lot of farming to get the recipe, the crafting parts, and doing so will usually bring you loot beating the weapons you want to craft- Leveling is original as it's quickly capped ; although it looks like it's designed to avoid grinding, the other parts of the game are full on grinding, so that feels a bit strange- World has its charm, although the artistic direction feels like a generic mobile game(yup, each Pro is its own Con! :-p )Cons :- Not possible to manually save game, and automatic saving takes you back to the last visited city, which is particularly annoying when coupled with the 2 following points- Randomly crashes when crafting or putting implants in our teams ; it happened in 4 different occasions to me and each time I had to restart several times till I could find a different way to build & apply my items that wouldn't lead to a crash- Exiting and re-entering a dungeon instantly will respawn all the mobs, so if you forgot to sell your loot before entering (or didn't have the occasion), you're going to have some issue (or maybe crash when your inventory gets full)- Difficulty is meaningless : it only changes what happens when you die, and basically the higher difficulty will only force you to restart leveling new characters when sh*t happens ; so the game has been mostly boringly too easy for me and I had no way to change that (not that the current gameplay mechanisms could have done anything to raise my amusement, though ;-) )- Final Boss is much much harder than other parts of the game and it forces you to grind to raise the power of your Party, and also requires dexterity from your fingers that was never part of the game before that point- Except the final boss fight, there's no real boss fights, only a few fights with tougher opponents that requires you to heal your party but doesn't involve any special event nor strategy- Combat is just smashing mindlessly over & over again the same ability buttons as soon as they are available ; there's no way to make combo or anything that would lead to build tactics- No auto-loot- Exploration of the dungeons is totally uninteresting (like in most top-down aRPGs)			"

												This game feels like someone took several successful games over the years and frankensteined them together, complete with a Swedish Mad Max voiceover.  The overall effect is initially disorienting, but smooths out as you embrace your new existence as a 3-person hive mind.The combat mechanic is pretty straightforward hack-n-slash (think Torchlight or Diablo), with the twist that you need to try to manage the actions of three heroes instead of just one.  After just a couple encounters, I realized that remapping my squad members' special abilities and treating the whole group as one entity was pretty critical to coordinating their efforts.  Over time it became apparent that much of the game's value lies in this novel approach.The navigation from town to town and much of the writing is very reminiscent of the first Fallout games. Random encounters occur when moving between known (and unknown) world map locations and the NPCs scattered around have hilarious problems that they need you to help with.There is also a basic crafting system and everything devolves pretty quickly into a treadmill of quest grinding and gear looting/upgrading.The world is mildly intriguing, if you are into post-apocalyptic mythos, and exploring it is the main reason why I continued playing after I wearied of inventory shuffling.

												Krater can be described as Borderlands, done in Dungeon Siege (3rd person party-based RPG) style. With 4 character-classes (melee tank, shooter, medic, and ninja), you take a party of 3 all over ""the Krater"" where holes opened to reveal treasures from the past, and perhaps, some dark secrets... while you deal with the dangers above ground from bandits, mutated animals, and some mysterious foe. Each character has 2 special attacks in addition to main attacks. Graphics are good, world is interesting, but character management is HORRIBLE. You don't seem to need to keep the same party from behinning to end as you swap out characters almost at whim. Crafting involvies finding blueprints and buying or finding parts and/or ingredients, and those can be hard to come by. There is no ""auto-loot"" which makes combat clean-up tedius. Improving characters means giving them ""implants"", and growth involves finding weapons with buffs (yes, ""Pistol of +2 INT"" or such) and/or implants (which are basically equipped buffs). This is a quirky game that doesn't quite catch the Diablo successor theme/goodness. If you can find it cheap, and have friends to play co-op, this game can be an interesting diversion.			"

												A great minor squardbased RPG, set in a quirky post-apocalyptic world in sweden. You get to asamble your squard after your playstyle, lvl up the different characters, get loot, tweek your characters with implants and much more.It seems like an openworld RPG but functions more like a classic tabletop RPG, where you move towards a place in a map setting, and if you encounter any hostiles, you ""zoom""down to the battlefield, that consists off a closed off erea.The combat is fun, but limited to 6 abilities, spread over your 3 squardmembers. I run the typical tank, ranged, healer setup, and its going pretty good so far. There are certain fights that is quite hard, and a few that will even kill you, but overall the game is well paced. Just remember to buy an upgrade for new levels (I didnt understand why I couldnt get past lvl 5, and that cost me a few deaths). You can do this in the second town, and it costs around 2k pr. member.I have only played 5 hours so far, so I cant really comment on story and lenght of the game. But so far im really enjoying the setting and the style.			"

												An unpolished turd.  Numerous crashes to desktop while trying to navigate inventory or upgrade characters.  Horrid pathing AI. So bad, that during some fights team members will suddenly run off up stairs and cause a wipe.  Sometimes getting halfway across a map before realizing ONE member just decided to stand in place, even while still being highlighted as part of the moving group.  Quests that cannot be finished because you happened to enter a dungeon prior to receiving the quest and kill the boss (everything else respawns, why can't this?!),  leaving numerous inventory slots full of quest items that cannot be dropped.  Frequent battles where one or two of your group just stand there.  Even after repeatedly retargeting.  Had an entire group wipe (4800Kr to heal the group which can take hours to recoup) because the bruiser couldn't seem to get to the target I selected for his grenade, and didn't want to attack any other target when selected.  Hours of time required to grind in order to upgrade characters in order to progress to a new area without wiping the team.  Very little variety in dungeons.  Unable for some reason most of the time to get the cursor to view other parts of dungeons and centering with space bar not actually showing ongoing battle made for frequent blind fights. Craft your own weapons?  Cool, except that once you're able to get far enough to purchase a new blueprint, it is already so underpowered as to be useless and a waste of crafting materials.  Sellers have no indication whether or not the blueprints they have are already known, and to even check you either have to alt+tab out and check your own notes, or exit the seller and run over to the crafting table to check, then run back and forth repeatedly as most people do not have photographic memories.  Selling back those expensive blueprints gives a 90% loss of value.  Blueprint listing isn't even entirely alphabetical.  It's like they did half of them, then added the other half also alphabatized but didn't bother to collate them together.  Oh, and for some reason the actionable area of the mouse pointer is well below the tip of the arrow (like halfway down the arrow), causing significant frustration early on trying to figure out why I couldn't select anything. Then in Alces Hollow my ranged crowd control Regulator decided he's going to start fighting point blank or not at all, thereby becoming two-hit toast in EVERY FIGHT.Beautiful graphics engine did not make this in any way enjoyable. This game had a TON of potential.			"

PremiseKrater is an aRPG, Diablo-Baldur's Gate crossover where you control a party of three characters, swappable between the fights with no limitations. Before you read the whole review and flip the table because I recommend you to try the demo: I recommend you to try the demo.The class systemThe class is immediate and simple, yet it offers a lot to play with: there are four basic classes and two races, humans and mutants; every class has two abilities, that are different from humans and mutants. We have 16 different abilities to play with, so.The four classes are:The Bruiser: the tank of the team capable of sustaining a large amount of damagesThe Medic: pretty obviousThe Regulator: a very useful support class, capable of stunning and slowing with the power of the electricityThe Slayer: a strength based character.Has to be mentioned how some abilities have very small differences, however, different abilities may lead to a complete different kind of build on the character.Ability system and diversificationEvery few levels we will unlock ability booster slots and implant slots, the former allow us to link a booster to our ability, the latter to link it to our character, improving our basic stats (we'll get to them in a moment).The booster we can bind to our abilities vary from Power boosters, which improve the damage of our abilities, to Healing boosters, which gives life drain or heal aspects, to boosters that temporarily improve our stats.The stats are:Strength: determines the amount of physical damage we do.Stamina: determines our maximum HPFocus: improves the healing effects of our abilities and the ranged physical damageIntelligence: decreases the cooldowns of the abilities we useDefence: reduces the damages takenThe game and its core mechanicsGame installed, new adventure begins, we're thrown in a very short and yet useful tutorial level; it tells us why we are where we are and lets us familiarise with the combat mechanics. Quite simply, right click on an enemy and wait until it dies, using the abilities of our characters when they're not under cooldown. A very simple and immediate mechanic, so, that is easy to learn and efficient to use to blend very RPG-like elements to the frenetic action of the combats; however, this wores out quickly, and in late game becomes kind of annoying, leaving the player no solution but to fall back on the booster/implants build to differentiate the gameplay.ExecutionThe graphic engine isn't the lightest in the world, but it's still pretty accessible, granting very interesting visuals and effects, even though we may notice rare graphic artifacts here and there, such as blinking pools of blood. What is disappointing is how sometimes the game fails to read our inputs, truly annoying when there are enemies on the screen: think how fun it can be to use an ability that won't trigger (or won't do it every time with the same sequence of inputs), or having your characters turning back and running towards the enemies they were fleeing from. Fortunately, this is a minor issue that happens every once in a while, so even though it has some major influence when it happens, it can be overlooked if you like the rest of the game.The sound department is what has stricken me the most: while the voice acting is kind of minimal, it's present and shows a successful effort to improve the immersion. The voices are in line with the game: humorous and funny, a good thing that reminds me of the Final Fantasy saga (Krater takes a good amount of inspiration from it, indeed). The sound effects are great, and you might take a break from the game often, listening the birds chirping with a beautiful background music.The durability is another good point: the Single Player campaign won't take us less than 12 hours, and to defeat the last boss we need a good party, which will probably require several hours of grinding to find all the things we need. This is a game that can entertain us for dozens of hours, if we can overlook how repetitive it tends to be once reached the end game, or if we simply love the good old grinding for items and gold, Diablo II style.ConclusionKrater is an indie game not free of flaws, but capable of gifting hours and hours of fun to those who can go beyond its deficiencies and limitations, easily worth its full price, a rip-off on sale.Buy it if you like action RPG and dungeon crawlers with a good humor, but most likely try the demo, as this is a very particular and unique game.If you need ratingsGraphic: 7Sound: 9Longevity: 7Gameplay: 6Final Score: 7/10			"

												Das Spiel Krater sehe ich mit ambivalenten Augen.Krater macht anfangs gut Spaß..man rennt so durch die apokalyptische Welt von Schweden nach einem Atomkrieg und trifft dabei auf allerlei obskure Gestalten, mit dene man sprechen kann und die einem Quests geben.Die Dialoge sind übrigens recht witzig und die Locations sind schön und machen Spaß.Im Verlauf schlägt man sich durch Dungeons, die meiner Meinung nach optisch Dröge sind, basht Gegner im Hack'n'Slay-Prinzip und sammelt Items ohne Ende wie in Diablo, das machte auch auf jeden Fall Spaß.Aber nach kurzer Spielzeit kam bei mir extreme Langweile auf, weil die Dungeons immer gleich aussehen und nichts aufregendes passiert, z.B. eine Wendung in der Geschichte.Die Quests wiederholen sich ständig und man klappert das dann eben so ab.Trotzdem finde ich, dass Krater ein gelungenes Spiel ist und ich würds gerne im Coop-Modus zocken, bislang hatte ich noch nicht das Vergnügen.Übrigens ist der Soundtrack im Spiel der Knaller.Krater wirkt irgendwie unausgereift auf mich, aber es hat mir am Anfang schon Spaß gemacht, sicher ein Game, welches man mit Rabatten und im Sale ruhig kaufen kann, es ist schon unterhaltsam.Items sammeln, Waffen craften, Implantate bei seinem Char einbauen..das macht einfach Laune.Ein Spiel, bei dem man ruhig zugreifen kann, trotz vielen Schwächen, die die Entwickler ruhig noch liquidieren könnten, ich hoffe da passiert noch was.Egal..viel Spaß mit Krater. :)			"

Each unit only has a handful of abilitys that you end up using the same way every fight, which made me start to dread fighting until I just said why am I still playing this.

It feels like a half finished version of what a more modern fallout 2 game might be. Stress on the half finished.

												I really tried to enjoy Krater but ultimately I found it frustrating. I usually like long dungeon crawls, but the lack of variety in combat abilities and enemy types made these a chore to grind through. The checkpoint only save system sucks. If you quit halfway through a dungeon, you keep XP, but all the enemies respawn and you have to grind through them again. Some dungeons can take 2 hours to clear, so I had to force myself to keep playing long after I got bored to avoid losing progress. Companions have zero personality and quests are of the uninspired kill 4 of this, fetch 5 of that variety. Levelling up requires a heavy gold investment to unlock level caps, and new recruits start at level 0 so require hours of grinding to become useful. The developers keep releasing patches, but I still encountered various bugs and crashes. The main story is okay but everything else gets in the way of enjoying it. The game is huge though, so if all this doesnt put you off, value for money is good.			"

(This means you can't complete any kind of quests with a friend)- Connectivity issues while playing CO OP. (Alot of disconnections)- Perma death. (This means that if your character dies, no resurrection will be available)- Uninteresting story. (Who cares?) - Boring gameplay. (I don't wanna play anymore..)			"

												The scenes are interesting and impactful if you are into this type of game.What I really wish is for the developer to ""reboot"" this series properly.It is a gem of a game, and I think most negative reviews came with the caveat: ""It could be such an incredible game but..."".That being said it would be really neat to see this game with the bugs fixed and some of the users suggestions implemented.

												This game received a fair bit of flak when released due to bugs. It has been fixed now and works great. You can even keep your original characters instead of having to swap them out once you hit level 5 with them. You also now have Co op play so some fun can be had with friends and the dungeons. The developers care about Krater and listened to feedback from players to improve the game and put things in the community wanted.Essentially we have an ARPG with a beautiful looking post nuclear setting, you start with 3 pre determined characters and head into town for the usual starter type quest.......basement / small room, kill rats or other small animals.It literally draws you in from the moment you start. Krater has humorous writing and some wild looking characters albeit very similar. The world, dungeons and effects are superb and on level with some of the more expensive titles in the genre.Well worth grabbing this game either for single or co op play. The reviews are now null and void as the game has evolved since release. Do yourself and Fatshark a favor and pick this awesome game up :)			"

												I don't understand the poor metascore.  Maybe I just like bad games.  This game is set in a wonderfully realized post-apocalyptic Sweden, and the developers have obviously put a lot of attention into the details.  The character design in particular is excellent.The squad-based gameplay is something I haven't seen before in a game like this and it works well.  The different class abilities make for some strategic combat, although the game could benefit from some more selection.The world is huge and engaging to explore, and the story, while sort of slow, is pretty interesting as well.The graphics have some slight framerate issues and it doesn't seem to matter how fast your PC is.  But aside from this and some grinding for levels, I don't have much to say negatively about this game.			"

												I knew Krater was going to be an action RPG, and I actually thought it would be a good 7 hours or so long, considering it's a downloadable game. But so far I've been playing for nearly 13 hours, without having done all the sidequests. It's fairly lengthy. It looks great, it sounds cool, it just works. 'Aren't there any downsides ?', I hear you ask ? Unfortunately, yes. Instead of using 3 main characters, you'll be switching them around several times during your playthrough. There's just no connection. And even though the upgrade system allows for a lot of custom builds; it's actually so diverse that you'll die quite often just because of this system. I'm stuck near the end and I just can't beat the final boss. It's impossible. Literally. Ok, I'm exaggerating. It IS possible, but you'll have to rebuild your characters entirely. It's just no fun.Also, the loot drops aren't all that great.Really, some of the design decisions... I just don't get them.  Ok... I'll stop now. Really.[Rating: 70/100]			"

												This is a real fun game and imo highly underrated. It might have been subpar when it first came out and greatly improved upon since then via updates, of which I am not sure, but what it is now is way better than the metascore would suggest. Good graphics, great sound effects, awesome art design, and controls well. It is a cool little world that they have thought up here and the characters and environments are all enjoyable. And probably the best thing about it, fantastic music. It ranges from moody to inspiring and gets you into the game and sets the atmosphere of the game perfectly. Yes the game has some issues like all indie games, but it is in a thousand times better shape than a ton of other games I have ever played, both indie and triple A. It doesn't have any defects that detract from the fun and for me is technically sound with no glitches and no crashes.PC Gamer gave this a 50 and gave Duke Nukem Forever a 80... that right there should tell you that this is without a doubt worth playing, and should also tell you that PC Lamer should have their editorial license revoked immediately and permanently.

												Covered in car license plates, a hulking mass comes slaming down into the world weilding his fully throttled lawnmower. As the blades tear into his enemies, he absorbs the punishment from the angry mob allowing the MK13 mutant to creep behind and penetrate a foe or two with laser eye beams, the ground now becomming scorched earth. Just as the bruiser swings his final blow before falling to trauma, a whimsical dr.Cerebro unleashes a soothing splash of green goo, injecting nanobites into his allies reparing life lost. And with the final slam, the game freezes and all progress was lost.Okay, so this game does have it's bugs and feels like a few shortcuts have been made in development, but it's incredibly addictive. The gameplay is quick and simple, RPG element is complex yet familiar. I was an Early Access for this game and it's come a long way... If they continue to fix the bugs, improve the camera angles, and clean up the UI as much as they've focused on their stunningly gorgeous landscapes and atmosphere then it'll be a great contender with any AAA dungeon crawler.Even if I had paid $15, with as much time as I've played, I got my money's worth.

You can't pause in combat to give orders, but the command system is streamlined enough that it is possible to keep up with your three characters most of the time.

The crafting and customization is not the most detailed, but it gives you some unexpected options if you can think laterally.			"

All missions and enemies will look the same by the end.And it's a shame too, because everything about Krater looks like it was made by people who have some talent, but don't quite know how to make the best of it at this point.

I myself almost preordered this game. Note: Krater is not optimized for lower end specs.

												Even though I’ve only seen four different classes available to recruit there is a huge amount of team customization available through the use of implants and boosters to enhance character stats and change skill effects respectively, so even two characters of the same class could be played differently. The enemies can be challenging but are generous with both the quantity and quality of loot. You gain levels quickly but only the three active team members get XP from encounters, if you want to keep your entire roster at the same level you’ll have to grind at least twice. Speaking of levels, you need to use the in-game currency to gain access to levels 6 – 10 and 11 – 15 which annoyed me. You can't access the menus from the world map either, also annoying. Taken as a whole, the game is decent and entertains me. So, I guess, if you were considering it and it’s on sale you might as well pick it up.			"

												A fun quirky game thats similar to Torchlight in terms of gameplay.  Its qunitecential Swedish setting, campaign story, voice acting and dialogue is a joy to experience.Controlling three of four different character types, all with their own core abilities (Healer, Melee guy, Tank and Tech-mage makes combat something different to normal aRPG.  It piqued my interest by offering a slightly different levelling mechanism, one which adds to the overall sense of achievement.  In addition your characters maxlevel is capped and must be purchased to go beyond a certain level.  At each level you open up booster and implant slots which enhance your characters attributes and add to their core abilities.  Which really makes your need to find sellable items and cash that much more urgent than just buying equipment.The crafting portion is a real joy adding a diverse collection of crafting recipes and ingredients which as you can imagine are accumulated through playing .  The real positive is the combination of alternative story/setting and the tactical group combat which takes this from being an also ran dungeon-crawler to something a little different and ultimately worth a second look.A real surprise.

												I picked this up during a Steam sale, and for what I paid ($5, I think) it was fun enough. It's a top down real-time RPG, you can have up to three members in your party and party members are recruited by class (Berserker, Tank, Controller, Healer). The novel twist to this game is the class mods that allow you to tweak how your ability work. So while each character has only two skills shared between all characters of that class, how they function depends on the class mod you slot into them. So say your controller has a slow field, you can throw in a heal mod to make that slow field slow enemies and heal party members, or a shock mod to make it slow and shock enemies, or a [stat] buff mod to buff team mates. And so on. It's novel. And while the game is original, I found the story to be unengaging. It's relies on a self-depricating Scandinavian sense of humour which seems to be popular (Dungeons of Dredmor anyone?) at the moment. Worth getting if you're bored and it's cheap.			"

												Though the game has some huge flaws, particularly in balance and difficulty scaling, the relative multitude of risks taken and new ideas implemented in its ARPG design make Krater unique.  With polish and some extra depth in lacking areas, such as story, balance, and expansion and greater incorporation of the imagined mechanics , this could be a a hit, especially featuring its somewhat fresh take on a post-apocalytic setting.As is, the game falls flat after a while, but playing with the mechanics and building a functioning party provided enough entertainment for me to devote time to the title.  I sincerly hope that the IP is continued and that the mechanics are improved upon massively.  This game deserves more work and thought.			"

												I like the game. I enjoy the exploration and the dialog is actually quite fun. But it could have been better...even great.The characters need more variety.  Each charater type (tank, dps and healer) have 3 rarities and depending on rarity they will have one (out of two) skill/ability sets.  True, you can add upgrades to the charaters, but even then you have limited choices. Maybe if each charater had a pool of diffrent skills available but only 2 of them could be used at a time (and you had to return to a town to change them) it would make it more interesting. (i don't know but is needs something to make the charaters more interesting)As it stands, you pick up the best charaters you can find. then swap one out when you find a rarer one and once you have the rarest you can find, you end up sticking with them till the end.  If one gets killed...who cares, find another of the best rarity you can find and move on.tl;dr = Good game, great enviroment, but needs more charater skills/abilitys, more charater variety, more reason I should care about my charaters...just needs more!

Would also be much better if there was more to do in the dungeons. Just empy hallways and rooms with groups of enemies ranging from 1 to 6. And there's a huge lack of ... well, things to open. Like chests and breakables. You're lucky if there's more than 3 things you can open. I didn't play it at launch, and I've heard it was HORRIBLE back then. Seems to have improved a lot since then, but it can get much, much better than this.			"

												The interface scales, regardless of resolution, to take up a certain amount of the screen. This is great when you are sitting right next to your high-res screen. If you are sitting right next to a low-res screen, or far away from a high-res screen, then you are completely ♥♥♥♥ed by a tiny, unreadable mess of interface icons and teeny weeny fonts.			"

												This is not a recommendation.If you ever saw this game on sale and thinking about buying it, please try the demo first. There is a demo available on Steam.Krater have some fresh new idea implemented in ARPG but suffered from a weak execution. The post apocalyptic world setting sure will attract Fallout fans. I myself almost preordered this game. Note: Krater is not optimized for lower end specs. Changing graphic setting in the option hardly do anything - there is no difference between high setting and low setting, even the Vsync option is kinda bugged. Intel HD4000 of an i5 (laptop) cannot handle this game.			"

												Krater for everything that it is, ends up far more lackluster then it should be. A lot of it's issues lay at it's most core foundation, and it will keep nagging you from start to finish. It's biggest issue is that right from the get go, your skills per charater are already desided for you. Each 'class' always has the same attacks no matter what, witch makes the next guy to replace your last not feel any different...because he's not. Yet here comes the next kicker, charater rarity. You have a team of 3 you use at once to clear maps, and it is massivly encouraged on you to buy and collect new guys to use, including once you relise 'white and green' 'rarity' versions of these guys have far less stats overall then their 'blue and purple' versions you don't start finding till a bit later on, after you've dumped a ton of money and gear into these other versions, and now have to scrap for the 'better'. Of couse the people you hire are all at level 1, and there is a 'max growth' cap on the 'lesser' units that will indeed force your hand to swap out that group that got you half of the way with the game...for another who work exactly the same, need to be leveled up all over again, if only because they can level up 5 more times then your last set and have a few more points overall, because you will need that extra 'omph' as you go more and more forward.What little this game does as nifty ( such as the team dynamic, the crafting, and the visurals ) are just knocked down by a lot of pegs because it's got such a basic core, that drags it's feet because you will waste more time buying and upgrading 'slightly better' versions of your guys for others, and you never really get different attacks, only slightly changing a few effects towards them.

												This game is strange. It has some pretty good graphics, and the sceneries are nice, but the gameplay is kinda boring, it takes too long to kill enemies, and if you rush the main quest, it become very hard, because you need some farm to prepare for more advanced areas. One of the things I liked the most was the view of the world map, it's pretty amazing. This game also lacks a variety of characters and skills. You get bored always using the same skills over and over, but it's nice to keep you entertained for a while.			"

												Krator was a pretty decent game although there were drawbacks that made me from playing it all the way through at times laying it down and playing it again maybe a year later from an old save. What made me do that? Well I'm going to tell you.I won't go into the good parts of the game like its graphics. Voices for characters the looks of your guys. Other things that made it good. But instead only its main cons that made me very upset with how the developers made the game.1. Barely no customization. None what so ever in changing how your characters look. Except for the weapons they carry. The only way is to buy a new character that looks different but the same class and scrap the other one basically. Or keep  the old one and keep them as backup.2. Only a 3 man squad at all times even though your party can be huge. Say 9 people are partners going about the wasteland and helping eachother except in battles or dungeons only 3 of them are fighting and doing missions for the ENTIRE group. Where is the backup? The other backpackers? The sniper helping out? NOPE! None. Only 3 guys of your choosing at all times. Theres not even mods that change this which could of been excellent for the game but no, those never came up. This made it really hard to complete the game which I still haven't because the bosses and enemies can get so hard its not even worth playing anymore without a friend coming to help. If only you could use your whole party and not only 3 of them that you could actually get things done faster and better. Whats the point in spending all your hard earned cash on new followers if you can't really have them out with your whole team. They need backup. This basically made the game dead for me. And extremely hard and not worth playing for a long time. It made it very grindy because while your old characters are out and doing the missions the others are not getting any experience and fall down the usage wheel and basically become dead weight cause they can't fight any of the higher level enemies. So with those two out of the way thats the only two main cons that made a lot of people upset. Its those two choices they made that really set the game level to drop for playability. And made it frustrating. The stories are fine, going through the map is fine, enemies are fine IF you could actually use your whole team and not just 3. Perma-death is awesome and makes you think over your choices except doesn't really have much of a point if your team isn't really helping all that much. All in all I can't recommend this game all that much cause of the future people who play this game that will get frustrated with its bad developer choices that made this game dead for me. But others may like it and I did like the story and I do want to finish the story. If they make the parties bigger it would be a huge major help for us singleplayer users that don't have a friend that wants to play this game to boost your party to 6 characters that go on the map. How is that fair for us as singleplayer users I might add? It makes the game easier but way more harder and frustrating for single player. If anyone that made this game sees this review, please, please, please make us be able to have a bigger party out for the single player users. Thank you.			"

												As far as Hack and Slash and ARPG games go, Krater ticks off a lot of the cool features of such games as well as brings something new and fun to the table at the same time.Hiring crew and controlling a team of three at a time is great. As fun as it is to be in control with your own hero, let's face it, it's absolutely boring when your one hero looks, feels and acts the same as every other user's hero if they happen to choose that race. So, how is Krater any different in that regards? Well, it allows for some diversity when you have a choice of 4 difference character classes. Ok, you're right if you're thinking that it's not that diverse but it's still a little bit different to just having on character, true?Anyway, being able to install upgrades and travel all around a map in a pokemon style way is quite fun. You never know when your team will be stopped within a forest to battle some enemies or even do some side quests.In my opinion, Krater is a really fun ARPG that should be given a chance. I'd love to try the multiplayer function; that side seems quite dead, sadly. I recommend it!			"

												Hoo boy, I really wanted to like this game. It's a bit too amateurish for me, and I'm pretty forgiving on indie titles. The writing is dull and trying way too hard to be Borderlands, the combat gets repetitive before you're done with the first dungeon, and I simply didn't feel attached to any of my characters since the game features perma-death and they've got no personality past a randomly generated name. Maybe it's gotten better, it's been a while since I played it, but I don't particularly care to go find out.			"

The mechanics are very simple and reminiscent of Diablo or Fallout with a smaller skill tree, class system and a lot of grind once youre at an advanced point in the storyline. The storyline is generic but the artwotrk and overal asthetic of the game is beutiful, Not the charecter design however but the overall scenery in game and actual cyutscene artwork does deserve some praise.The Gameplay is quite cluncky and you will find yourself saying ""WTF i did not say go that far....STOP YOU Intercourse Muscle head, born of five mothers and expelled by 2 fathers STOOOOPPPP!!!""however I do suggest playing this game caussaly because it is quite (Personaly I find) beautiful and simple but in all honesty its just a ""Switch of game"" that can be played when there is nothonig to do.

												HORRIBLE GAME. Don't bother spending money on this game. A game that had huge potential, got blown away by crappy control, odd places and odd combat mechanics. If you can get over these, then sure, you may love this game, but overall, it could've been more fluid.IF you want to buy it, buy when price drops to 2-5 bucks, else its not worth $10+			"

Krater is a tactical action RPG set in post-apocalyptic Sweden.  Sounds awesome, right?  Well, with a little more patching I think it could be, but right now the game is far too buggy to recommend.The first thing you'll notice is that despite looking and playing like a Warcraft 3 mod, this game runs like♥♥♥♥♥  The framerate is lower than one would expect given the graphical complexity and apparent number of objects on screen.  This isn't game breaking, but it's still unpleasant to look at.The cursor is insane.  Its actual position does not match up with the arrow point, and its location is inconsistent: sometimes it will be a few pixels above the point, sometimes it's on the arrow's shaft.  This can be really jarring before you realise what's going on, and almost convinced me to quit before I figured it out.  There's also noticeable input lag, which is not something you want in a real time tactics game.  This input lag really shines when a character dies, as the camera does not automatically center on the next character, so you have to waste precious milliseconds double clicking a portrait so that you can continue commanding or start running away.  These issues make it needlessly difficult to micromanage the troops and greatly diminish the game's tactical aspect.Aside from that, Krater has potential.  The level-up method is quirky and allows for a good amount of character customization.  The setting is interesting and the game world is pretty big.  Maybe the developer will eventually patch out the problems, but until then I don't recommend this game.			"

												I don't even know how to describe this game. It's like a very poor attempt at Diablo with a Borderlands vibe to it. The game literally has no story driving the game and its gameplay is boring. The game has to be played in the lowest resolution possible unless you have a very damn good computer. Whoever made this game should have quit while they were ahead. Glad I bought it for $2.00 on a coupon.			"

												I bought Krater a while ago. this game was originally sold on the idea that you'd have a party of Diablo like adventurers that you could swap out  to achieve different play styles. I played the game shortly after release and found hat the ""many"" different play styles bordered around 4 different classes with 2 abilities per class. You can combine these four characters, tank, heal, dps, ranged into any combination of 3 characters. Still a very Small amount of possibility considering you'll need a healer and a tank in most every situation.add to that the lack luster story, and buggy, sometimes broken gameplay. this game is definitely a PASS.

												The game is plainly not worth it. Co-op is a joke, Combat System not so good, character abilities and skills customization rather limited, tends to be repetitive and uninteresting most of the time, requires a lot of system for not so much in graphics, story and characters so uninteresting. Although it has a huge overworld map while maintaining rather fast loading times everything else just makes it boring and out of the question. At least it had a 90% coupon with which I bought it for about 1.50 euros but still it is not worth more. If it doesn't have a big percentage off, you should rather avoid it.			"

												Krater is a squad based post-apocalyptic real time strategy RPG.  Now that may seem like a mouthful of gaming mechanics, but imagine it being a mix of Diablo, and a little bit of MMO.  I know that sounds unconventional, but bear with me.You control a squad of three 'soldiers' who can be of various classes.  You can also have many different characters in your 'reserve' that you may swap at any time outside of combat.  These classes range from tanks, healers, and damage dealers; thus, the MMO trinity. (For those unaware of the MMO 'trinity'; it is the basic make up of a group you would need in order to tackle a difficult dungeon/challenge; a tank to absorb and take all the damage, a healer to heal the tank and group, and a damage dealer (one or more) in order to drop your enemies.) While you do not have to follow the trinity, I would imagine that it would be difficult to conquer the harder challenges in the game without it.What's so exciting about this concept is that instead of executing just one role as you would in an MMO, you control all three roles.  You're controlling your tank, your healer, your damage dealer, and their abilities all at once.  Now, each soldier only has 2 independent skills each as opposed to the many you would have otherwise, but this makes the game-play a lot less complex and allows you to micromanage each squad member without feeling overwhelmed.The game is entirely real time so you are required to think on your feet when you engage in combat.  Not only that, but the game is loot driven as well, you are able to loot your enemies after taking them down and there is a chance to get some great weaponry.  If you enjoy real time strategy and diablo-esque dungeon crawlers with some loot and crafting mechanics, this is the game for you. Did I mention it had coop?You can find more of my ramblings about video games at www.chatswithrad.com "

												Looks like fun but unfortunately it isn't. You are forced to routinely change your characters, having to start all over again after upgrading them with implants etc. It's hack and slash but without any kind of real depth and just a huge grind for nothing, as you lose everything with each character change, which is often. Spend a bit more and get Torchlight 2 or Diablo 3, or play Path of Exile for free. This game will drive you mad before long.			"

												Overall presentation looks very polished, with the art direction seemingly influenced by Fallout and Borderlands, specifically the Bandit faction. A better-looking (and more technically demanding) game than Torchlight. The variety in terms of art assets feel noticeably lacking though. Very limited selection of music, dungeon tiles, and set pieces means that none of the towns and dungeons feel very distinct.Where this game really falls apart, however, is in the game mechanics and itemization. Every five levels, you hit a level cap, and you either have to ditch the party member and recruit a new one that can advance to higher levels, or pay a significant amount of money to unlock the ability to level further. Leveling up provides no satisfaction because the only tangible upgrade is the unlocking of slots to put modifiers in. Modifiers that require you to grind to be able to craft or buy. You will likely hit the game's level 15 cap long before you can afford the better modifiers.Each party member only has two skills. There is no skill tree to speak of, and the only messing around with builds you can do is to add modifiers to a skill. There are a sparse handful of weapon models, and no unique / legendary loot. No set items either, not that there would be much point since each character only has a weapon slot and a consumable slot.			"

												First of all.. I LIKED THIS GAME. but...- Its full of small and annoying bug thats does not seems to be fixed for years now. Some of them makes you not able to get achovements that are simply broked. Does not work, just like that. If you are kind of guy ( I am for sure ) who likes to have 40/40 achivements then game will dissapoint you. - Co-op is non existant, so if you buy this game be sure you want to play it single. - Game randomly crashes sometimes. - You reach max lvl way too fast and only weapon progress seems to keep your down from pulling all map at once.Anyway I really enjoyed this game while I played it only for 2-3 days. Thats max you can get from it, while keep enjoying content(more or less).Word of advice:1) Get OFF card, its not worth this 15E2) Dont buy DLC those are only 1 hero to recruit. If you are to buy DLC buy it AFTER you played 3-4h, you will understand ;)			"

												Not what I was expecting based on the screenshots and write up. Glad I bought it on sale else I'd kick myself.I was expecting Freedom Force meets Fallout: post-apocalyptic (which it does deliver, at least), strategic (I've been in one fight that lasted over a minute, and that was facing two healers who spent more time healing each other than damaging me = frustrating, not strategic), and larger-than-life, wacky characters (not even close, the ""characterization"" in your party is all in the first two minutes, then just the 3 or 4 random sayings while walking around - the characters in Baldur's Gate had more variety).There are also a lot of bugs, especially the audio. Load screen music stutters constantly, and the volume of combat music/sound effects changes almost every time one character uses an ability.If you want an RPG, play something else, if you want challenging fights chained together by less story than your average porn flick, Krater will satisfy.

												Krater     This game is rather fun for the first while after you clear what I like to call the intoductory story. Basically once you have got your full team and cleared the first few locations the game becomes rather bland and repetative. I personally dont mind playing this as a touch and go game but I have never been able to make it that far because I loose interest in it far to quickley.     The gameplay is not bad but I would recommend that anyone interested in purchasing this game look at some gameplay from youtube or similar sites to see if it is something that you are going to enjoy. I would also recommend that you look into the items  and character available to learn about some of the bad points this game offers.P.S. Be carful for spoilers when researching the gameplay though since I would say that the story is one of the most redeaming qualities.Rating:2/5  - Just a Normal GameThanbk youskirby1990			"

												I started this game with the best of intentions. The events are set in Sweden after what must have been a nuclear strike. What was once Stockholm is now a large crater where people try to make a living by digging up the remnants of the past civilization, while defending themselves from bandits and mutated animals. I'm drawn to post-apocalyptic stories and liked the idea behind this game. Being Swedish myself, I appreciated the references to Swedish language and culture.However, the game quickly becomes repetitive. You spend 99% of the time underground, fighting dumb (and apparently deaf) enemies every 10 meters. Fights seem to take longer and longer as the game progresses. I stopped after having explored roughly half of the map. The fighting felt more like work than play.Graphics design and animation is more than okay, but sound and voice acting reminded me more of games made in the mid 90's, such as the Swedish ""Backpacker"" series. The music was okay and fitting, but repetitive like the rest of the game.Play Wastelands 2 instead.			"

Nope.And even if it did work, it\'s grindy in all the worst ways and the control scheme is extremely clunky. I don\'t know how to explain it, but it\'s just not satisfying to do anything in this game, and navigating the hub town (which should be at worst functional and fast and at best is the favorite hangout of players) is really bad.I look on the bright side of most games, but this game is a whole lot of rusted scrap iron without a whole lot of bolts to hold it on.

												Ignore the Metacritic score, it's in no way indicative of this game since most of the reviews were based on a beta quality build. Many of the problems mentioned in the reviews have been ironed out long ago and are no longer relevant. The more I play it, the more I like. Very fun, innovative --- and a lot deeper than the critics will have you believe --- and definitely worth the price.			"

												Krater is an interesting and original RPG, with a clear action orientation and an unusual post-apocalyptic universe that pulls you in quite easily. However, I had much issues with a key design choice made by the developers: in Krater, instead of leveling up one or several heroes over time like you would do in Diablo or Torchlight, your heroes quickly reach a maximum level. This is the game's way to encourage you to level up many different characters, try out new tactics, etc. But for me, it was a blocker: I didn't want to be ""forced"" to level up different heroes, I wanted to keep improving the ones I loved, but that wasn't possible.For this reason, past the first few hours of honeymoon with the game, I found it had lost most of its charm, and became quite repetitive, as I had lost this ""drive"". For this reason, I wouldn't necessarily recommend Krater, despite it being quite original and with an great quirky setting;			"

												I've read a lot of  negative comments about Krater ,such as the game itself is laggy ,other person was whingin about characters not been responsive to mouse clicks etc,etc  ,so I have decided to buy this game and test it and see what all the fuss is about...I've played something like 20 h or so and I have to say that Krater is an amazing game .It is true it's a bit of Fallout in it but I love it ! The game is not laggy at all .I don't know what sort of moron said that Kraer is laggy ,I've spent a lot of time playing it and no problems at all.The game drags you in ,the story line is awesome ,the graphic is cool ,and the sound and music is incredible. The best thing in Krater is that you don't level up...you open your implants and booster slots while you're progressing so you can apply to your skills whatever you want. The skill tree is very basic (you got 2 skills) but you can assign to them a lot of other booster and implant. The game is awesome and should deserve at leat 70 MS in my opinion. "

												This game is awesome when you can actually play it. There was a mixup when it was released and they incorrectly stated that mac 10.6 could play it.

												 I cannot recomend this game. It just has far to man bugs, bugs that were reported back when the game still received updates and never got fixed. any not simple bugs that you can just ignore and continue, bugs that break the main quest and make it impossible to continue, becaue you have already fulfilled the object, which cannot be repeated, and the quest never completes. you have no choice but to quit or start a new game and that is unacceptable.it's sad really as this game is very fun. and on hardcore has just enough challenge.

												Despite the many negative reviews, I opted to take a chance on this game and was not disappointed.  Having stated that, the game is not overly complex and as many have said, most dungeons are quite simplistic.  However, I rather enjoy that aspect as it makes for a ""quick game"" here and there.  Some of the controls could stand to be a bit better, and as many have said, the cooperative aspects of the game feel incomplete.The setting is unique with a rather interesting story.  I deeply enjoy post-apocalyptic/cyberpunk games such as Shadowrun or Syndicate, and this game fits right in.  The more I play this title, the more I enjoy it.  I highly recommend this game for very casual gamers who enjoy similar titles, with an emphasis on very casual.More serious gamers will most certainly be put off by the various flaws in the game, which can be an annoyance.  Nonetheless if you are a casual gamer and enjoy games you can play ""now and then"", this is a fine choice, though I recommend picking it up on sale.			"

												This was a fun and interesting game while the price wasn't too outrageous. There were a few minor bugs and glitches but that could be overlooked. Although the downfall of this game was many, including myself, losing their games to corrupted cloud files which couldn't be restored. The only option being to begin a new game. As I said it is a pretty good game, but not that good. I'm not sure where the fault lies more for the cloud between Fatshark or Steam, regardless there is no solution and the consumers are the ones paying for it. I will never buy another FatShark game. I will not buy another Steam game until this problem is completely taken care of.Bottom Line (tl;dr): DO NOT BUY.			"

												If you're on the Krater page during a sale, which is the only time this game seems to get noticed, and you're thinking, ""well, I spend $25 a week on sugary drinks, so what's $3-5 for a game that looks like a neat little co-op experience,"" you're kind of where I was when I bought this on sale. Trust me, it isn't worth it. It'd be one thing if the game wasn't a headache to get going, but Krater is optimized EXTREMELY poorly, and thus it is. Even if you can get past that, and it took me awhile despite having built a new PC recently, the gameplay is just about as generic as it comes. But really, the biggest problem here is said optimization -- if you're going to make this type of game, which isn't exactly stocked with content, it needs to be accessible. Krater flat-out isn't.

The music sounds like a sci-fi movie from the 70's, which fits suprisingly well. Also, it being made by FatShark means it has it's fair share of glitches, but it's suprisingly nothing too gamebreaking. I reccommend this to you if you enjoy loot-fest RPGs.

You can also visit a barracks type location to recruit new characters or train up your current characters so they can gain further levels.This game is not for everyone, but if you like RTS and ARPG games then this might be up your alley. There really aren't too many games like this out there that I am aware of.

												Overall presentation looks very polished, with the art direction seemingly influenced by Fallout and Borderlands, specifically the Bandit faction. A better-looking (and more technically demanding) game than Torchlight. The variety in terms of art assets feel noticeably lacking though. Very limited selection of music, dungeon tiles, and set pieces means that none of the towns and dungeons feel very distinct.Where this game really falls apart, however, is in the game mechanics and itemization. Every five levels, you hit a level cap, and you either have to ditch the party member and recruit a new one that can advance to higher levels, or pay a significant amount of money to unlock the ability to level further. Leveling up provides no satisfaction because the only tangible upgrade is the unlocking of slots to put modifiers in. Modifiers that require you to grind to be able to craft or buy. You will likely hit the game's level 15 cap long before you can afford the better modifiers.Each party member only has two skills. There is no skill tree to speak of, and the only messing around with builds you can do is to add modifiers to a skill. There are a sparse handful of weapon models, and no unique / legendary loot. No set items either, not that there would be much point since each character only has a weapon slot and a consumable slot.			"

												This seems like yet another game someone decided to s-h-i-t out half done because Steam doesn't require an actual finished product. This is why a good 40% of the games on Steam never get finished, and why 37% of all Steam games never get played. That's a fact reported by Forbes magazine. Look it up. This game was fun for about ten minutes. It very quickly becomes repetitive, monotonous, boring, and just lame. Had potential, yet again squandered by idiotic devs. There is a REASON games were made by major companies and not independent developers. The companies actually KNOW WHAT THE F--U--C--K they are doing. Games like this, Robocraft, and Starcraft make it painfully obvious too many indie developers are completely f--u--c--k--i--n--g clueless and have no business making video games except for them and their dumb a--s--s friends to play.

												A post-apoc Diablo clone where you control a team of bizarre mutant roustabouts instead of a single character. This is fairly amazing. Fun, simple, bold. The game looks beautiful. It's funny and easy to understand without being entirely oversimplified - it still surprises me with it's smart dialogue and self-awareness. Cool game.			"

												+Beautiful aesthetic. Seriously. No brown-n-bloom, it's a world recovering from a nuclear war.+Hilarious weaponry. The bruiser class can wield a gas stove strapped to a metal pole as a flaming bludgeon, for example.+If you hit an enemy with a critical hit, they explode. For example, I had a massive brute armed with a push mower, he was so massive he swung that thing like a stick. He went toe-to-toe with a bear and the mower's motor was going full tilt. Next thing you know, he ♥♥♥♥ing slapped that bear across the face with the mower's bottom so hard the bear DETONATED. ♥♥♥♥ING BEARSPLOSIONS.+bork bork bork put dur chikkin in dur booshkit+Ability customization. Wanna make your slayer's impaling attack steal health from the enemy? Attach healing boosters to it!  Wanna make your regulator's electric field deal damage over time? Attach a damage booster to it!-Not much else to be had ;3;-Sometimes the difficulty of an area can be seriously out of hand. My team got stampeded by a mutant moose, two bears (lol 2bear), eight wolves and approximately 2.3 boars.-Fatshark will not continue with this game. Despite, you know, the ♥♥♥♥ING BEARSPLOSIONS and all.			"

												Not what I was expecting based on the screenshots and write up. Glad I bought it on sale else I'd kick myself.I was expecting Freedom Force meets Fallout: post-apocalyptic (which it does deliver, at least), strategic (I've been in one fight that lasted over a minute, and that was facing two healers who spent more time healing each other than damaging me = frustrating, not strategic), and larger-than-life, wacky characters (not even close, the ""characterization"" in your party is all in the first two minutes, then just the 3 or 4 random sayings while walking around - the characters in Baldur's Gate had more variety).There are also a lot of bugs, especially the audio. Load screen music stutters constantly, and the volume of combat music/sound effects changes almost every time one character uses an ability.If you want an RPG, play something else, if you want challenging fights chained together by less story than your average porn flick, Krater will satisfy.

												Decent game for the price paid from a bundle along with a few other titles. game mechanics are a little blah and can be a little frustrating at times. Gameplay seems decent too. I wouldn't suggest paying full price for this, Who does anyways?  Wait for a nice sale or as a bundle, this game is still pretty good.			"

												I think this game was very cool, don`t understand the low meta critic here. Is it because the game happens in Sweden maybe so people from elsewhere than Scandinavia don`t understand the humor? Well I would still recommend the game to anyone out of the nordic countries and I would give it 8/10 as a score instead.			"

												This game is amazing.  Not only does the game challenge you by blocking your #1 used spell but to make things even more interesting you can only move to certain locations on the map found by clicking everywhere.  This is truly a work of art game and to top it all off after you have finished playing the game for the day it will crash your steam so you know that Krater is the only game on steam.			"

												This is a good little top-down RPG like Torchlight that is best played with friends online. You can play single player, but it can be tricky to coordinate 3 heroes simultaneously when all of their skills are hotkeyed numerically (i.e. 1-6). It's a good looking game, too, and you can see a lot of thought and work has been put into each aspect of the game. ***			"

												What a disappointment, this game chugs even on the lowest settings. I can at least play Metro Last Light and all the Bioshocks if I turn the settings down, but this? Nope.And even if it did work, it\'s grindy in all the worst ways and the control scheme is extremely clunky. I don\'t know how to explain it, but it\'s just not satisfying to do anything in this game, and navigating the hub town (which should be at worst functional and fast and at best is the favorite hangout of players) is really bad.I look on the bright side of most games, but this game is a whole lot of rusted scrap iron without a whole lot of bolts to hold it on.

												I started this game with the best of intentions. The events are set in Sweden after what must have been a nuclear strike. What was once Stockholm is now a large crater where people try to make a living by digging up the remnants of the past civilization, while defending themselves from bandits and mutated animals. I'm drawn to post-apocalyptic stories and liked the idea behind this game. Being Swedish myself, I appreciated the references to Swedish language and culture.However, the game quickly becomes repetitive. You spend 99% of the time underground, fighting dumb (and apparently deaf) enemies every 10 meters. Fights seem to take longer and longer as the game progresses. I stopped after having explored roughly half of the map. The fighting felt more like work than play.Graphics design and animation is more than okay, but sound and voice acting reminded me more of games made in the mid 90's, such as the Swedish ""Backpacker"" series. The music was okay and fitting, but repetitive like the rest of the game.Play Wastelands 2 instead.			"

												SO... MUCH... GRINDING...  The inability to really focus on a single character through the game takes away from a lot of the fun for me.  You are essentially forced to get a new character and level them up to their max every few zones.  I prefer being able to take the same group, develop them, and play with them if i choose instead of tossing them to the side all the time.			"

												Really fun game. Reminds me of the older Fallout games, traversing an overworld map and getting into random fights, as well as a game called Granado Espada, controlling 3 characters at a time, and using all their skills at will. It's simple looking, skillwise, as you only have 2 for each character, as well as a special item later on, but it gets pretty difficult.Also, bruisers with health on their skills is hilarious.			"

												Despite the many negative reviews, I opted to take a chance on this game and was not disappointed.  Having stated that, the game is not overly complex and as many have said, most dungeons are quite simplistic.  However, I rather enjoy that aspect as it makes for a ""quick game"" here and there.  Some of the controls could stand to be a bit better, and as many have said, the cooperative aspects of the game feel incomplete.The setting is unique with a rather interesting story.  I deeply enjoy post-apocalyptic/cyberpunk games such as Shadowrun or Syndicate, and this game fits right in.  The more I play this title, the more I enjoy it.  I highly recommend this game for very casual gamers who enjoy similar titles, with an emphasis on very casual.More serious gamers will most certainly be put off by the various flaws in the game, which can be an annoyance.  Nonetheless if you are a casual gamer and enjoy games you can play ""now and then"", this is a fine choice, though I recommend picking it up on sale.			"

												This seems like yet another game someone decided to s-h-i-t out half done because Steam doesn't require an actual finished product. This is why a good 40% of the games on Steam never get finished, and why 37% of all Steam games never get played. That's a fact reported by Forbes magazine. Look it up. This game was fun for about ten minutes. It very quickly becomes repetitive, monotonous, boring, and just lame. Had potential, yet again squandered by idiotic devs. There is a REASON games were made by major companies and not independent developers. The companies actually KNOW WHAT THE F--U--C--K they are doing. Games like this, Robocraft, and Starcraft make it painfully obvious too many indie developers are completely f--u--c--k--i--n--g clueless and have no business making video games except for them and their dumb a--s--s friends to play.
