												A good addon to the Company of Heroes franchise. Adds two new playable teams; the British (a hardcore defensive team), and the Panzer Elite (very hit and run with good heavy tanks in endgame). Maps are also added but few in number. Could be a little better balanced but if you fancy a challenge in MP, hit up the British, we like a challenge!			"

												If you liked CoH, you'll like this. Opposing Fronts is a standalone expansion for Company of Heroes. It adds 2 new armies (The British and the Panzer Elite) for multiplayer/AI matches, two new campaigns for both factions, unique new doctrines and tons of new units with loads of abilities. -Armies/UnitsThe British are a good solid defensive faction. Most of their power comes from emplacements you build.Pros- Command Trucks are used for HQs, meaning you can place them in any of your secured territories, boosting its resource output. Heavy defensive positions like Slit Trenches, MG Positions, AT gun emplacements and Mortar emplacements can be built for a small amount of resources and population. Infantry can be upgraded with many different weapons, increasing their efficency against other infantry, light vehicles or heavy tanks. Their doctrines offer Commando Support which allows you to land a glider with 6 Commandos, a glider with a light tank that is effective against halftracks, infantry and other light tanks, and a HQ glider which allows the production of AT commandos, Mortar Commandos and HMG commandos.Cons- They are purely defensive (unless you use the Commando Doctrine) and do not have much offensive capabilty. Their infantry walks very slowly through enemy or uncaptured territory to gain more defensive against attacks (which is annoying at the start). Their tanks (aside from the Sherman Firefly) all have small guns but heavy armor that can't do ♥♥♥♥ against many medium to heavy tanks. -The Panzer Elite are a very mobile faction. Most of their amor is made up of halftracks (which can be pretty powerful) but they can get some good heavy tanks and tank destroyers. Pros- Great faction for quick and powerful attacks. Infantry halftracks let the garrisoned squad shoot out the top with any weapons they have (bazzokas, mgs or snipers). The Marder tank destroyer is extremely good with an ability to ""lock-down"" making it immoblie but a faster rate of fire that does more damage. Almost all of their infantry can repair stuff. Cons- As said before, their armor are halftracks. -Overall Score: 8.5/10 A good game but better as an expansion to CoH 1.			"

 Originally posted on November 24, 2007Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts is an expansion pack, but it is sold as a stand alone game, much like the recent Supreme Commander expansion. It provides two new campaigns, covering the Liberation of Caen as the British, and Operation Market Garden as the Panzer Elite. the inclusion of the Panzer Elite is an interesting touch, as few games to date have German campaigns. The campaigns have solid stories, and good replay values through different difficulty levels and medals. However, the game is not really about the campaigns; It is about the new factions, the Brits and the PE. They drastically change the balance of multiplayer, and needless to say, there are still some significant balance issues to work out. All in all though, the new factions are great.British-The British are all about defense. They have the capability to build some amazing defensive emplacements very early on, so watch out for that. Their infantry is very solid, but their armor is weak and expensive.The Panzer Elite- The PE, contrary to their name, are not about panzers, but rather are about fast attacks with mechanized and motorized units. They have a wide variety of halftracks and armored cars, including mortar halftracks and AT halftracks. Perhaps their greatest weapon is their tank destroyer, the Marder II, which is one of the best in the game. On an overall level, Opposing Fronts delivers, but if you are new to the franchise, try the original first.			"

												Opposing Fronts introduces two new single player campaigns. The campaigns feature gameplay from the British perspective and the German perspective. The British campaign features nine missions focusing on the attack by British and Canadian forces on the city of Caen. The German Panzer Elite's campaign features eight playable missions following a Panzer Elite Kampfgruppe in occupied Netherlands that is bracing itself for one of the largest airborne invasions in history.

												By far the best RTS. Relic have nailed the idea of making the whole genre more actiony. They did it with Warhammer but that stuck more to a particular audience and the slight cartoonish graphics put many off. Now in company of heroes it has polished graphics and a subject to suit a wider audience. WW2 although seems quite an over used subject for gaming, has never been as explored as this in an RTS form. The reason for giving it an 8 is because the new expansion was a marketing scheme all along. If you want to survive in multiplayer you must get this game otherwise your whermacht will be screwed by British artillery that can fire at your base from the other end of the map. Be sure to buy and play!			"

NOTE 1:My game time should be around 500 hours by now if I count my time outside of Steam when I first bought this game in 2006.NOTE 2:Also see my Company of Heroes Review here:http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/4560Also see my Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor here:http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/20540TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts is a real-time strategy game developed by Relic Entertainment and published by THQ (RIP). This game serves as the first official expansion pack to the series which adds two new factions, new units, a German (Panzer Elite) and British campaigns along with new multiplayer maps.The expansion pack 'Opposing Fronts' added 2 new campaigns for the new factions of Great Britain who's plot revolves around the British Royal Army's operation to retake and secure the city of Caen in northern France. On the other-hand, the new Axis campaign featured the Panzer Elite faction in their mission to foil an Allied Operation called 'Market Garden'.PROS:+ Improved special effects+ New Factions+ German and British Campaigns+ New Units are fun to play with+ Standalone Expansion but...(See CON #3)+ Allows players with the expansion to play with players without the expansions and vice versaCONS:- Balance issues- AI is somehow worse than the original- Does not include the original armies unless you have the original game- Campaign has some dull moments- Inconsistent sound / voice levels for some of the unitsCONCLUSION:GOOD EXPANSION but could have used a little more polish. Opposing Fronts is a great expansion that adds a lot of replayability to the original game by adding new factions; new units; new Campaign and a ton of improvements that increases the authentic feel and immersion of the game.MUST BUY for RTS and World War 2 fans whether at full price or on sale. Although, I highly advice the 'Complete Pack' (which includes the original game and the 2 expansions) to have the full experience.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts is a great standalone add-on for the main game. It provides 2 new armies, 2 new campagins and few extra units for the main game (if you own it, that is). You can use this Add-on as a seperate game and just use this content or you own the base game and the content adds up - you suddenly have 4 armies, a lot of campaigns and extra units. Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts does the same as the main game - great campaign, enjoyable sessions against AI players and one of the best and most balanced Multiplayer RTS games on the market. 10/10 the first of 2 great Add-on's to the main game.

This review is mostly geared towards people that have a hard time enjoying RTS because of their skill level.Here's just how garbage I am at RTS games, so look at these cons, and then apply them to how good this game must be to outweigh my incompetence.  What I can't do:• Use hotkeys (I use like, 'R' for retreat, and other hotkeys for things you'll use a lot)• Keep track of more than one unit at a time• Plan ahead• Micromanage• Multitask• Not suckWhat I can do:• Click• Pause the game and queue orders (shhhhh)• Dump ridiculous amounts of hours into a game, I should have a bad time with.• Set teammates to hard, and enemies to easy• Artillery barage both teammates and enemies alike• Feel the need to actually write a review about itBut in all seriousness...I've always wished I was good enough to take full command of a battlefield with only hotkeys, and be able to play with my friends in Starcraft, but I had to accept that I'm just not good at the genre.The features of the game, as well as my friend convinced me to buy it, and once I did I couldn't stop playing it, simply because of how much much the gameplay was able to outweigh the mechanics and skill.Oh, and another thing that you could use to reference just how good this game is:Look at my steam libraryLook at how many games I haveLook how many games I thought I'd likeLook at how many ""hours"" I have on my gamesLook at how much money I've wastedRealize that this game must be something special.P.S.For the hardcore, elite RTS veterans:My review might make it seem like the game is dumbed down, but the point I was trying to get across is that it can be fun for every type of gamer. The game mechanics are super in-depth, and combat is super fast paced. You don't need top worry about the game being too easy.			"

												(EDIT) First things first. What I've of played of this game is incredible. You care about your troops even though you can make new ones just like Dawn of war. There's plenty of additional defense strucutures to build like Barbed Wire, Tank Traps, Mines, Sand bags and turrets, all of these reuslt in the perfect defense if placed correctly. You can choose whether to play as Axis or Allies, in my opinion the Axis are more fun to play as but for the Allies it's cool to drop troops from Air control onto the battlefieild using battlefield perks - They are basically specific types of troop reinforcement to use such as: Plane and air control, Artillery, etc I recently came across a problem whilst playing the game, It was entirely not the games fault, I'll leave it in the bottom of my review so that it explains the comments.I am new to coh. So I downloaded the Demo a few weeks ago and being a fan of Dawn Of War and WW2 immediately loved what I saw. So I decided to purchase the full game in eager anticipation.I had purchased the New Steam Version and Southern* Fronts DLC. After installing I launched it and couldn't play half the game because It said ""You require the original Company Of Heroes gme to play this."" Even though I had JUST downloaded it. I went ahead and waited for the DLC to install and loaded that up. Exactly the same problem. I then got annoyed and wanted to play the damn game, so I set up a Skirmish match. the building models and soldier models were gone, only their shadows remained. I looked up a soultion for the problem and someone mentioned changing the grapchical options so I did... It caused the game to go to a black screen and immediately crash. Not happy at all.			"

												The Revolutionary RTS.Gone is the simple spam and zerg tactics of the classic style, gone is the throwaway hordes of troops.Now each man, each vehicle, and where you place them mattered. The environment providing cover, concealment, and chokepoints. Less emphasis on refining your build queue and your most efficient productions. More emphasis on tactical placement, securing vital territory, and improvising on the fly.The Gold Standard every RTS should aspire to.			"

												One of the best real time strategy games ever made on the PC.  It has a complete destructable environment and unit cover system and suppression system.  Flanking the enemy really means something in this game.  I have played countless hours playing this series I definitely got my monies worth with the first game and the two stand alone expansions paying full retail price.  Getting this series for $9.99 on steam sale is a steal!  Also having this series on steam means it will auto patch to the proper version.   This series have been patched and balanced mutiple times and having to patch manualy is a pain.  Having this on steam is a very big bonus.The Company of Heroes and Opposing Fronts has a long single player campain.  Also Opposing Fronts adds the British and German Panzer Elite forces.Tales of Valor only has a very short campain.  But, focus heavily on mutiplayer with a few additional units for each force and different mutiplayer modes like  1vs1, 2vs2, 3vs3, 4vs4. and more!			"

												Opposing Fronts is a standard expansion. A very standard expansion. It does everything that an expansion is supposed to do, faction, units, maps, campaign. Adding new things within the same frame as the main game. The problem however is that none of it is particularly inspired.Two new factions are introduced, a defensive British army and a mobile German one. However neither of them really brings anything new to the formula.The campaigns are an utterly standard experience and although the cut-scenes and storyline have been heavily improved upon the gameplay is inferior to that of the original American campaign.Opposing Fronts does what is needed, it gives the single-player fanatics a reason to take Company of Heroes back off the shelf. But it does not give them any reason to keep it down. It is a game that you play and then forget about a few days later.			"

												Great rts... I tried multiplayer  playing against my friends before.Then i played on steam and  couldn't see end of a game at multiplayer with my old computer cause of crash reports.         coH players knows.I can easily say it's not like other RTS games. First of all, It's hard to play.  Moves that you will do with limited resources are very important in this game. You can't sit back and drink relaxing tea most of the time. Basics of rts games are chanllenging: Keeping a group of soldier alive, defending an area or bulding,  extending the boundaries... Doing those things at the same time is exhausting in this game. In this expansion pack we can choose british and panzer elite diffrently.         I recommended this game If you interested in World War II or challeging rts games.			"

The game, of course, continues to use the same mechanics as the original with an added weather effect and offers two new campaigns for the British and German Panzer Elite (Kampfgruppe Lehr). CoH: OF is worthwhile and it should be a no-brainer for CoH fans, but whether or not you own CoH: OF - you still have interplayability with other players from the original.			"

												Quite possibly the greatest modern RTS game to date. With a cover system that no other game comes close to implementing and voiceovers of Germans cursing when a pershing rolls over the horizon you simply can't go wrong. It's the kind of game that if it were possible to hide a tank up a tree this game would have done it. Definitely check out the Eastern Front mod if you get this game. There's nothing more enjoyable then using tanks that have huge naval cannons attached to them. Also troops popping out faster then rabbits can breed.			"

Its advantages are:+ Great and almost realistic graphics+ Extensive system of destruction and damage+ System developed to improve the army+ Possibility of building fortifications+ Obstacles giving cover to infantry+ Diversity branches+ Unique skills special guide individuals+ The ability to summon support and expansion of the army+ Several difficulty levels+ Long and captivating campaignThe only drawback to the game is that it contains only one campaign. The problem can be neutralized by purchasing add-ons ""Tales of Valor"" and ""Opposing Fronts"" adding up to 5 campaign.STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME EVERYONE !!!			"

												Missed out on WWII because you were born after 1945?  No worries!  Shoot Nazis to your heart's content with Company of Heroes.  It's pretty great as far as RTS goes, the Allies have the vehicle inclined British and the all around Americans and the Axis has the infantry inclined Wehrmacht and the vehicle inclined Panzer Elite.

												Let's play the Imagination Game. You're Relic, and you've just made Company of Heroes, what many consider to be one of the best RTS games in a long while, perhaps of all time. After a series of patches where you've basically changed numbers at random while sobbing into your keyboard and wondering how Blizzard does things, you've finally managed to achieve a semblance of balance in the multiplayer metagame. WHAT DO YOU DO?!If you answered ""introduce two ridiculously broken factions that, even if you iron out the multitude of bugs infesting both of them, are going to be very difficult to balance even for people who know what they're doing, which you clearly do not,"" then you win the Imagination Game because that's what Relic did.Thankfully, though, one of the unbalanced factions is the British, so you get to listen to British accents, including their ridiculous pronunciation of ""Lieutenant."" Do you see an ""F"" in there? No? Exactly.			"

												Look, the game itself is fine, very intense playing.  However that being said, this game, although its been out for years continues to crash about every 20 to 30 minutes.  If you havn't saved recently, then you are screwed.  I'm surprised that a game so mature still has these problems.  I've sent many crash reports off to the developers, but no reply as yet.  The game I would recommend, the instability I would not.  Probably 5/10 for mine.			"

												I never played much strategy games except Total War series, (which strategy aspect is not challenging if you will so , I would say casual friendly, one can just sit and enjoy epic battles in TW series) but Company of Heroes proved me that I do need to be a strategist or tactician nor prefer games requiring such thinking. In 2006 i played that one only beacuse it was amazing from technical side. Top tier graphics, audio, physics etc. And to this day CoH, now on Steam(New Steam verion) remains most often played game by me. To think that once i was mainly FPS/RPG genre player, and CoH changed that says much about it's quality.			"

												""Another WWII RTS"", you think. Good thing Company of Heroes - with its expansions - provide something fresh and interesting despite the overused theme of video gaming. Forget the zerg rushes and spams, this RTS emphasises tactical AND strategic view of the map. Territorial control, resource management, and careful use of small-sized units are the very ""breathe and eat"" core mechanics of the game. Learn 'em, or perish!In addition, this is of the rare WWII -themed RTS games, which actually provide an enjoyable and somewhat aspect-neutral German campaign! Without looking too much from the ""American viewpoint"", the German soldiers are shown as any other men who gave their lives in the great conflict.In general, the gameplay is brilliant, and the factions feel balanced enough to keep you playing - disregarding the questionable community debates. Don't forget the great mods, like Blitzkrieg or Eastern Front!			"

												Opposing Fronts is the first expansion to Company of Heroes, and is by far the single most important of the pieces to pick up. OF adds the British and the Panzer Elite factions into the game. Britian is my personal favorite faction, and it favors strong, fortified defence and a generalized infantry-centric army that can deal with any threats, athough not reallty specializing in any field. Meanwhile, the Panzer Elite (Poorly named as they have only one actual tank) focuses on an extremely offensive and mobile army in which highly specailized vechicles perform a narrow role, and thus every unit serves a spefific purpose. Both factions are extremly unique, and do not feel like retooled American/Wehrmacht. OF also adds two new campaigns for the two new factions. In all, if you loved CoH, you will adore the hell out of this expansion.NOTE: Getting this expansion only, without the base or Tales of Valor, means that you will only be able to play as the British or Panzer Elite.

												Adding the British and Panzer Elite faction, this game grows in variety and scope significantly.  I haven't delved much into the story but the varieyt added to skirmish mode is more than enough to keep this game going.  The factions balance nicely and the differing play styles bring variety and a host of new options for all.Great improvement to an already fantastic game!			"

												""Another WWII RTS"", you think. Good thing Company of Heroes - with its expansions - provide something fresh and interesting despite the overused theme of video gaming. Forget the zerg rushes and spams, this RTS emphasises tactical AND strategic view of the map. Territorial control, resource management, and careful use of small-sized units are the very ""breathe and eat"" core mechanics of the game. Learn 'em, or perish!In addition, this is of the rare WWII -themed RTS games, which actually provide an enjoyable and somewhat aspect-neutral German campaign! Without looking too much from the ""American viewpoint"", the German soldiers are shown as any other men who gave their lives in the great conflict.In general, the gameplay is brilliant, and the factions feel balanced enough to keep you playing - disregarding the questionable community debates. Don't forget the great mods, like Blitzkrieg or Eastern Front!			"

												The game has some flaws. It is not quite as realistic as it could be to create an authentic experience, but the gameplay is super solid and a lot of fun. The DLC doesn't break the game like in CoH2 yet it is worth it's price for a fan for sure... ever since the new steam version came out there have been a lot of problems with matchmaking, connecting to other players, etc. but after multiple fixes and updates it is working rather smoothly now 90% of the time... the only problem is, the amount of people playing is dropping so it might be hard to find someone to play....Still it remains one of my favorite games of all time ...

												CoH is possibly the best RTS I've ever played. It's very fast-paced and forces you to micromanage your units every step of the game. This makes it one of the most immersive games I've ever played in general. I've often found myself talking to myself as if I were actually giving orders in real life. If you've ever been remotely interested in the RTS genre or WWII games, this is a must buy. If you can, buy CoH: Tales of Valor, as I believe it comes with all the factions. Every faction is well balanced with unique strengths & weaknesses, the gameplay is tight & polished, the graphics are beautiful, and the community is still very, very much alive on the new Steam version.

												Opposing Fronts is the first expansion to Company of Heroes, and is by far the single most important of the pieces to pick up. OF adds the British and the Panzer Elite factions into the game. Britian is my personal favorite faction, and it favors strong, fortified defence and a generalized infantry-centric army that can deal with any threats, athough not reallty specializing in any field. Meanwhile, the Panzer Elite (Poorly named as they have only one actual tank) focuses on an extremely offensive and mobile army in which highly specailized vechicles perform a narrow role, and thus every unit serves a spefific purpose. Both factions are extremly unique, and do not feel like retooled American/Wehrmacht. OF also adds two new campaigns for the two new factions. In all, if you loved CoH, you will adore the hell out of this expansion.NOTE: Getting this expansion only, without the base or Tales of Valor, means that you will only be able to play as the British or Panzer Elite.
