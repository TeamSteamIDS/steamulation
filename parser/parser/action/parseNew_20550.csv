												Man, i don't know. I have mixed feelings about recommend this or not. Let's start the Review:Red Faction 2 when compared to its predecessor, is a disappointment. Despite maintaining certain foundations established in the first part, mainly due to technical issues.PROS :- LOTS of weapons (with primary and secondary shot system for each one as in the first part).- The shooting mechanics makes some intense gunfights fun.- Sections where you drive vehicles are well made ​​and are quite fun.- Apart from the primary mission objectives, the game have hidden secondary objectives for each map, which when completed, will give you bonus points.- Karma system that varies the ending of the game (Accomplish the primary and secondary objectives provides you of good Karma, while doing bad actions like killing innocent civilians, will give you bad Karma).CONS :- Generic story.- Easily forgettable characters.- Clearly this is a PS2 port (You can easily notice it viewing the avaliable options, not to mention the graphics).- Enemies and allies AI is doubtful.- There are sections where enemies respawn infinitely until you pass a certain point.- Exploration of the maps is practically non-existent (compared to the first game).- The Geo-Mod technology is implemented despite being not quite exploited.- Ridiculously short (the campaing last 5-6 hours).If you can get past the fact that this is a direct port of a PS2 game, and you value the game for what it is (a short, mindless, linear first person shooter focused only in killing whatever you have in front) you may like it, if you want something deeper, you won't find it here.My Score: 5.8/10Note: Played it on Windows XP - SP3			"

												What can be said about Red Faction II? The original Red Faction was quite a success (in terms of quite positive reviews and sales) so a sequel was eventually determined to come out soon. Originally a console game and later ported to the PC, it tries to outmatch its predecessor with more action, more vehicles and with a definitely more stupid storyline. What's the final result?Of course it's not as good or original as Red Faction I. The charm of sneaking around in a Mars colony is nowhere to be found anymore (there's really no link to the story of the first game), the gameplay got definitely dumbed down and the level design is extremely linear. To make it worse, you can no longer make use of the legendary GEO MOD engine as in Red Faction I. You are partly able to blow out some walls or pillars, but that's all. GEO MOD my♥♥♥♥♥Nonetheless I must admit that riding vehicles or blowing away enemies with your yellow grenade launcher can be quite fun. The focus definitely lies on action and that's not necessarily a bad thing. On the other side the cons really let you down after all.The Good:+ Non-Stop action+ Many vehicles+ Many weapons+ A not so bad second half of the gameThe Bad:- Dumb, repetitive gameplay- Linear level design- Boring, foreseeable story- A horrible first half of the game- No real replay value- No real multiplayer available, only a bot modeThe Ugly:-- Non-skippable ingame cutscenes (I HATE that, seriously)It's really hard to recommend this game in retrospective. It's an ugly console child with a horrible first half and a more interesting second part. If you still decide to buy it, at least do so during sales or via the Red Faction Collection.4/10 "

Pros-Better quest tracking compared to the first one-Dual wield weapons-Fun cheatsCons-Short-Bad story-No checkpoint and the manual save does not save where you are in a level, only which level you reached so if you are far into a level and you die/want to quit, you will have to restart from the beginning of the level.Neutral-Jason Statham is one of the voice actors in the game.Overall not as good as the first Red Faction. Don't go into it expecting the same style of game, the only thing it has in common with the first one are the nano cells and the name ""Red Faction"".			"

												The game is kind of charming in an off the walls, nonsence, crazy shooter way. But this is not a good game: the story is bad, the graphics are terrible, they just throw you into to it and it makes zero sense. The charm comes in from its innocense, it feels like this game wasnt made as a money grab but more as just a fun project. Its honestly  fun just running around mindlessly blowing dudes up. While playing it I had no idea what was going on and i was thiking to myself that this is so dumb, but I was still having fun. I will say though if you are looking for a good sequal to a great suspensful and intresting first person shooter this is not the game. Im giving the game a recommendation because it is genuinly fun but it is by no means a well made game.			"

												The Final Boss:[no spoiler] If I were to give one reason to play this game, it would be to challenge your gamer skills against the final boss (easy mode doesn't count!) HOLY COW BALLS, RFII has one of the hardest final bosses I have ever played against. Palms sweaty, pants full of spaghetti, and mom crying in the bathroom, I will never forget that day I had to face one of the toughest opponents in gaming history.Other than that, this game is mediocre, probably worth it if it goes on sale for under $5.

												Red Faction II is a sequel of Red Faction by Volition Inc. While the first game has you starting as a simple miner caught up in the rebellion and you end up being the best soldier capable of defeating even mercenaries, this one has you playing as Alias, one of the few nano-tech enhanced soldiers left in the world, joining Red Faction against the authoritarian regime of Sopot and his elite guards. The story felt very derivative and rather lame, compared to the ""fish out of water (that turned out to be a shark)"" story of the first. This time, you're simply better than anybody else, and everybody knows it. You're the demo guy, while others in your squad are scout, sniper, heavy weapons, vehicles, and commander. Graphics are good for the time, and Red Faction has a feature called ""Geomod"" which allows certain walls or terrain features to be destroyed, creating alternative avenues of approach. However, what's destructible and what's not are not obvious and you don't have indefinitely amount of ammo for experimentation. in the single player you will sometimes have to create exits with the explosives. Based on tech of the time, poly count is relatively low, but tolerable. Texture was state of art back then and merely tolerable now. The fun part is the gun play, but this is an old-school shooter... no lean, no cover and blind shoot, no tagging, What you see and aim in the crosshair is what you get. And you get to carry bazillion weapons... single or double pistol, machine pistol, and later, nanotech pistol (single hand means you can throw grenades, doubled gun can't use grenades). Then you get to shotgun (dual barrel, one with regular buckshot, other with incendiary) SMG, assault rifle, assault rifle with grenade launcher, LMG, rocket, grenade launcher, sniper rifle, railgun, and other fancy weapons. There's also grenade, incendiary grenade, and satchel charges. You will also sometimes get to play with vehicles, such as aerial gunner (man the turret!), submarine fighter (launch torpedoes), tank (main and coax guns), as well as armored suit with rockets and twin gatlings, just to break up the monotony of shoot, shoot, and shoot. There are occasionally severe lack of hints, as you are given NO IDEA on where to go, but if you explore a little, there's probably a door you need to open, or a hole you need to make bigger, or a wall you need to jump over, and such. And to encourage you to go on your way, an infinite number of enemies will spawn to ""encourage"" you to move along and since your ammo is limited, you should move along, albeit this was never explained anywhere. On easy level your health resets to 100% between stages, so that makes the game quite a bit easier. Furthermore, your health autoheals if you stay out of combat for about 10 seconds. You can have up to 3 health kits on you, and they will auto-heal you when your health gets too low. Obviously that means you should not get hit that often, lest you run out of them! Fortunately, they often can be found on dead soldiers (just run over them to collect). It's only later that there are certain enemies that don't leave loot. All in all, RF2 is an also ran. In making the protagonist a super-soldier, it also lost most of the charm of ""fumbling your way around"" of the first RF game. Not to mention the plot is virtually cliche. Basically, you do the heavy lifting, someone else reap the benefits, and then there's the... surprise! :)   I managed to finish it in a couple hours, and I'm not a speed-run guy. It's just very short in single player. I imagine there can be more fun in MP, but being this old, MP lobby's long dead. It's kinda fun for historical purposes, and it's cheap, but you'd probably be better off with a modern RF, like RF: Guerilla or such.  "

												Just finish the game, it didn't felt like it was very long in this game, but to compare the 2nd to the 1st, I have to say the 1st was better for number of things, such as hit boxes, as well bosses, only hardest part in the game was the final boss, everything else was pretty darn simple and easy. Over all the game was good, the plot wasn't to bad, but the twist in the plot was pretty lame, which they could of easily just ended, but didn't, also the bots in this game were alright, not the greatest. If you wonder if this game tied to the 1st game, it's hard to explain, but none of the characters from red faction 1 has anything to do in red faction 2 plot other than the plot that carry over at the start of the game about the nanobots technology which used to make super soldiers, which doesn't tell you about any of the character from red faction 1, as to what happen to them or what.Pros:- Bots are pretty good.- Playing the game on certain difficulties to unlock game contents.- Has Bots to fight in a match such as team deathmatch, etc...- Get to customize the bots for Bots match, such as behavior, stats, etc...- Great boss fight challenge at the end.- Lots of weapons to use in game to choose from.- Awesome vehicles to use in game, mostly liked the battle armor.- Destroying some environment.Cons:- The Plot has some pretty bad flaws.- Hit boxes wasn't that great compare to the 1st game.- Mostly simple and easy to beat the game.- There no online/lan Multiplayer, only Bots match, where you fight nothing but just bots.

												The first part is much better in terms of gameplay, and considering how many bugs in the 2nd game of the series, it's just awful!It's a real bad console port, it's very tedious to play, and most of the time you're so frustrated by the awkard things that just kept happening while playing. I had to reload way too many times. When I need to reload becouse I died in a game, thats fine, I just try to refine my strategy, but when I need to reload becouse the game is acting up, thats just bad.			"

												Ouch. What a disappointment. This is not only a downgrade compared to the first game, but it's a radically different kind of game whatsoever. Not that I have a problem with something different, but when the first game was already quite original and interesting, sacrificing that in the name of dumb, macho straightforward action with a laughable storyline and unappealing characters. The level design ranges from frustratingly confusing to infuriatingly linear ""Call of Duty"" style, complete with piles of rubble conveniently blocking the paths you can't follow. What's worse is that the game boats is Geomod feature, but makes poor use of it -- you can never know when you're allowed to blast your way through a door or wall, or just patiently look for another way around it. And really, when you have rockets and grenades that can punch massive holes in regular walls, not being able to walk through a simple locked door is pretty insulting.If there is something that could salvage this game is the weapons, which are pretty nice and diverse, but weapons alone don't make a good game. The bad level design and arbitrary variations of difficulty along the way work against the fun constantly. But what utterly killed the experience are the unskippable cutscenes. Now, the first Red Faction also had those, but you could save the game anytime and anywhere, so you could conveniently save after one of those. But here, you're not allowed to save manually, and you can only restart between level transitions; and some of them have some extremely long and boring cutscenes at the immediate start, especially the tough boss battles. I have no problem with a tough boss, but when I'm forced to idly stare at the screen for 20-30 seconds to watch a cutscene I have already watched, and which adds no information at all about the game, that drives me nuts.Overall, it's a huge wasted potential: it's not very fun, it's very ugly and boring to look at, and it doesn't follow the original game at all. If you really expected something to carry on the experience of Red Faction, abandon all hope.			"

												Don't. Just don't. There are better games. This game is.... it's bad. It's essentially what Red Faction: Armageddon (I mean, Armageddon was disappointing comparing it to Guerilla, but that is at least better than this blasphemy) was to Red Faction: Guerilla. Red Faction 1 was fun, interesting, but... Red Faction 2 is just... like, at some points I found myself having mild fun while playing it, and then the feeling of numbness just returned after a while. The characters are bad, the story is awful, and... did they really have to remove/lessen the extent of how destructible environments were? I know in Red Faction 1 they were there, but in Red Faction 2...Also, perhaps something I should have started out by saying, this game has literally nothing to do with the Red Faction. It doesn't even take place on Mars, it takes place on Earth. I played Red Faction 1 prior to this game and remember thinking ""I'm having fun."" but when I was playing this game I just sort of spaced out and kept thinking to myself ""Why am I playing this? I have hundreds of other games I could be playing."". The terrible voice acting just droning on and on... my Steam time for this game is like 3.8 hours. I won't lie, after the first hour and a half of playing this game I just wanted it to be over, so I turned on the cheats and just suffered/blasted through the rest.I can't even get over the fact that they called this Red Faction. It's not Red Faction. Thus, if you're actually looking to play through this series (or more likely, you played either Guerilla or Armageddon and are interested in giving the older games a shot which is how I ended up here, play Red Faction 1, and then skip over this one. You will literally be missing nothing.)1/10			"

												Many years ago I had played the demo version of this game on Playstation 2, which included most of the second level. Having played the first game on the same console, I had a higher expectation of this one. The game feels and looks basically the same as the console version. There are a few subtle good things worth mentioning upfront. It would have been one of the first games to move towards some proper dual-wielded weapons- in which left-click fires one and right-click fires the other. It has an interesting way of introducing each (admittedly bland) character upon your first encounter with them. It has fancy animations on the edge of the screen when putting on your nightvision goggles (rather than just instantaneously switching like most games) or getting into a ""Battle Armour""- unlike most games of the time, in which the player was simply in a vehicle right after pressing the button to enter it. One weapon- the NICW- even has a digital ammo count on the side of it, reminiscent of the Assault Rifle from the original game. Unlike the PC version of the original, this includes a Bot Match mode against AI-controlled players- something which was in the console version of the original. This is a typical Quake-style deathmatch which strangely has a different HUD- and the weapons behave differently. For example, the Rail Driver in single-player has 3 rounds and a reload between each. In Bot Matches, this same weapon has 6 rounds and only requires a reload after firing all 6...The story is almost cringeworthy at times. It goes on a semi-political bent and basically has all the characters betray you shortly after first meeting them. It has almost no connection whatsoever to the story of the original game. It reuses some music assets from the first game in Bot Matches- some of the techno-style tracks from the first game, some of which are quite impressive. The game is basically linear and very poorly designed in some parts. The sewer level's beginning is one of the better examples of this. Everything is maze-like and you'll probably just get through it guessing where to go- having to shoot at the same constantly respawning enemies along the way. Once you're at the end of the level, you probably won't be able to think about the map design in your head. Trying to understand the maps... your thoughts will be about as murky as the sewer water. The game's difficulty is also really inconsistent. You will find some shockingly easy parts and then run into a boss battle with an enemy possessing a ridiculous amount of health and respawning minions to assist them. Boss battles should have been toned down, standard gameplay should have toughened up. You can't leave a vehicle that you have entered unless you are in a certain area. You can't skip cut-scenes- prepare to rewatch the same one before a boss battle several times if you die in it. The game includes a fairly rudimentary health regeneration- where you essentially have one small health bar and you automatically use a health kit once that health bar runs out. You don't manually use your health kits- nor does it take time to use them. You will finish it in 3-4 hours (maybe less) if you don't die much through it. As many other reviewers have stated, this is something of a downgrade on the first game. For something from a professional studio- Volition- it is almost unforgiveable. I think most players will find this game to be extremely generic and short- a 5/10 at best. Spend your money on the first game instead.			"

												The watered down, badly done member of a series that has otherwise been very groundbreaking, red faction 2 still has destruction and plenty of badass guns. This game might not have the story or the charm of other games in the series, but if looked at on its own without their influence, red faction two is a badass FPS with a simple story, lots of guns, and the ability to blow open walls and just about anything else in view, even revealing secrets from time to time. It is not as good as the other games in the series, but do not be fooled, red faction 2 is not a bad game. Go into red faction two just wanting to enjoy its weapons, destruction, and bot based multiplayer, and youll find its pretty damn good. You can't approach every game wanting the pinnacle of what it is supposed to be, red faction 2 is not the pinnacle of anything, but its a good mix of fun themes that go well enough together for some good fun. Still a bit sad its so short.Also! Make sure it will run, it has a big warning about what cards it will not run on!			"

												Red Faction 2 has issues but is worth playing anyway.There is no multiplayer (except vs bots) but then again even if it did by this point nobody would be playing it. There isn't as much destructible terrain as in either Red Faction 1 or Red Faction Guerilla but there doesn't neccesarily need to be. The story is a bit boring and more than a bit predictable but truly amazing stories in shooters are a rarity.As for what the game does right the weapons for the most part are very varied and feel decently well balanced. There are some weapon balance issues, the grenade launcher pretty much beats every other explosive weapon in the game in terms of efficiency and the sniper rifle is extremly powerful for how much ammo drops for it, but they aren't massive problems. The game has regenerating health but it is slow and mostly there so you are never in an unwinnable situation. Most of your healing will be done with medkits which you can carry 3 of with you that are used automatically when you would die. The campaigns vehicle sections also aren't the worst thing ever being playable but not fantastic.Overall the key is to not go into Red Faction 2 expecting the greatest shooter of all time or some completely destructible environment. If you go in expecting a decent old school style shooter you will probably enjoy yourself. If you need a score i would say this game is a 7/10.			"

												Red Faction II is a lackluster, short, and underwhelming first person shooter. Even though it's called Red Faction II, it almost feels as it has nothing to do with the original game. You can tell this is a terrible PS2 port as the game and controls are dumbed down and becomes a mindless shooter. The story is boring and predictable and the gameplay is as well. The campaign is short and took me about 3 hours to complete and is not interesting at all. There are some levels where things are mixed up where you are in vehicle and get to man the turret or walk around in battle armor, however it becomes repetitive and tiring fast. This time the game utilizes more of the Geo-Mod as more environments are destructible, however that does not overcome the overall boring, disappointing and forgettable gameplay.			"

												I tried to like this game. Really, Red Faction series is great, with this exception. I had bad feelings looking just at the menu. Then I've been thrown into action, and I didn't even know when and where the story happens. It doesn't feel like Red Faction game, it's just decent FPS with weak story, kinda likable guns - ability to dual wield is always nice. I refused to continue after I've been stuck at mission with trains and exploding robotic spiders. Design of that level is dumb as hell. Also, WHY DOES THIS GAME NOT HAVE SAVES, USING GOD-DAMN CHECKPOINTS INSTEAD?! If You were looking for more RF fun, just as me, do not buy it.			"

												A brilliant game that I enjoyed all the time since it came out. To me it seems to have more character interaction and more music along the lines in comparison to the first Red Faction. It has a slow start but about from the middle of the game it really starts to kick in with all it has. Contrary to what games today do. They show off their best parts from the start - not Red Faction II. This game shows that it was made in 2002. It is simply awesome. Do not listen to other people.Yes it's different from Red Faction I, but in a good way, with it's own advantages.Just have the patience to finish the game. It's worth it.  If you enjoy sci-fi, science fiction or even anything remotely gothic, you should find this interesting as the locations distinctly showcase Churches, graveyards, abandoned metroes and also loud factories going down in a classy fashion. This is my type of action.Just how much is it's soundtrack worth?

												Brace yourself, hipster Nac Mac Feegle is once again going to attempt to confound popular opinion with a wordy, over-stuffed review.Red Faction 2 is a great game. It isn't deep, it isn't an industry leader, but it is a fun game. I know this because I had it on my gamecube back around 2004, completed it, and always remember it as an underrated shooter.What does it get wrong?Well, they will tell you it is shallow, predictable, a bit bland and a big departure from what made the original game so good.What does it get right?Well how about I answer this question with a bit more depth:I want to make it clear that I played the first Red Faction, and I really enjoyed it. I loved the gameplay, setting, and also the little 'glass house' side game. I didn't feel any sense of disappointment, however, when I played this sequel.The game starts with you acting on behalf of a corrupt dictator (looked a bit like one S Hussein) as part of his elite counter-goodperson squad, sieging a base of revolutionaries. The mission introduces you to fellow cybernatically augmented comrades, destructable environments, a great assault rifle/grenade launcher weapon, and sets you up for a campaign of twists, thrills and spills.The very next mission has you and your turncoat comrades storming the central government tower of the dictator, blasting chunks out of his gigantic stone bust, flying through the streets shooting fools from a gunship gunnery seat, and getting right into the nitty gritty of joining the Red Faction.Missions are varied. Weapons are also varied and generally well balanced. Pacing is good and tight, maps are thoughtfully conceived and often showcase the wide range of vehicles one can make use of. The graphics and gameplay may be getting outdated these days - how could they not? - but the fun of the game shines through yet. Incidentally, the console version had multiplayer with good bot AI and some great scenarios, something that was golddust on the often PG rated gamecube system.I don't know why people didn't like this game, even if it didn't blow my mind in the same way Halo or Metroid Prime did, I really enjoyed the storyline - in the later stages of the game the levels get really good indeed - and I actually thought some of the weapons were pretenders to iconic status, the relatively vintage AK-like assault rifle, the aforementioned super assault rifle, the blocky shotgun and dual weilded submachine guns were all really great.I think you can get a raft of shooters that may be better, but this shooter deserves to be played if only because of the hours that went into producing it, the genuinely wide range of things they developers got right, and the unfair blasting it has routinely suffered from critics.

												Not sure why there are so many negative reviews ( Especially since half don't even give a valid reason other than ""Not reccomended"" or ""Outdated graphics"" ) this game was easily one of my all time favorites as a kid.Who cares if the level design is linear or if the graphics don't hold up to 2016's standards, this game was made in 2003, back when, for the most part, games were something more than repetitious grinding for a cosmetic item or playing the same match over and over again for a whole day or more so you could advance a single rank, this was back when games were about mindless fun you could pick up and play without having to worry about anything but beating that one pain in the♥♥♥♥♥level with nothing but the tools at hand and maybe a few hidden powerups along the way.If you want to play a game that involves running around blowing stuff up to get to the next segment and don't give a damn about a decent story ( Although the first RF's was great ) then this is the game for you. My only complaint is the lack of splitscreen multiplayer which was originally on the Xbox 9/10			"

												Red Faction II is not worthy of it's title.The story is not in any visible way related to the rest of the Red Faction series, so if you don't play, you're not missing anything.The gameplay seems much more oriented to just destroying and killing enemies without purpose, compared to the first game where there is clear direction, and where stealth may be a key tactic.The control system works well with a keyboard/mouse setup.The graphics, somehow, seem worse than in the original game, even though it was made later. Things seem more blocky, as well.The voicing in this game seems to make use mostly of generic ""shoot-em-up"" lines, and isn't very interesting. This is slightly redeemed by the fact that Jason Statham voice acts in this.The installation works fine on windows 8.1, no issues as compared to the first game. Check the forums for a guide if you do have issues, though.Don't buy this game. It doesn't play a part in the wider Red Faction story, and it's poorly made.			"

												★★★✯☆Red Faction 2... now talk about a change of atmosphere , this game doesn't remotely feel like Red Faction 1, although that doesn't mean it isn't a kick♥♥♥♥♥game, this game focuses on the story of a elite soldier who was betrayed and how he gets back at the now bad guys , the games controls are really excellent and so is the difficulty progression ... that is until you reach the final boss -_- absolutely the worst boss I have ever faced , first off it has a huge amount of health , and when you do finally weaken him enough you fight the second ""form"" and in this ""form"" the boss's default attack instant kills you if it hits you and then you have to start from the cut-scene again ... -_- God that was annoying , after changing the difficulty to easy and finishing the final boss battle I can say this is a fun and TOTALLY NOT frustrating game XD 3.5/5!

												Red Faction II is the sequel that fans of the Red Faction franchise would rather forget. Decent graphics for the time, trouble free gameplay (no crashes & full 1080p), multiple environments (some levels are completed on foot, others in planes, others in tanks, others in power armor), and great voice acting (Jason Statham!). So what are the drawbacks?Red Faction II contains little or nothing that made the first Red Faction game a classic. The game is linear as hell. So was the first game, you might say; but even within the levels, there often were multiple ways to progress. Not so in Red Faction II. What about Geomod and destructible terrain? Well, that's still here, kind of. There's plenty of stuff that is destructible. But instead of unlocking different routes, Geomod's role is reduced to the only path. One level begins with Alias in an alley with both ends blocked off. There's no way to progress forward. Oh, wait, shoot those barrels. Boom! The wall explodes and (realistically) crumbles, opening a hole to walk through. There's your Geomod. Also missing is the Everyman character. Parker (Red Faction), Alec Mason (Red Faction Guerrilla), and Darius Mason (Red Faction Armageddon) were all ordinary joes called upon to be heroes. In Red Faction II, we play as a Nano-agumented super soldier who is already special. The plot might look fine on paper – super soldiers attempt to overthrow a despot – but the execution isn't even up B-movie standards (maybe C-movie standards). And while the voice acting is good, there's no emotional attachment with Alias (your character), even when he is betrayed and has to fight an entirely new enemy about half-way through the game.Red Faction II is also short for a fps. A complete run-through clocked in around 5 hours. The enemies are generic and repetitive (even the “zombies” of later levels present little challenge). If you're good at getting head-shots, you'll be able to coast through this one. The boss battles do present a decent challenge; the final boss is insanely hard / old school at first. Then I realized his pattern (from which he never deviates), and beat him in 90 seconds. There was one boss that had a charged electrical field for protection; if he got too close, and you became electrocuted, all of your controls become inverted (left is right, down is up). That was fun and a great challenge.But one unique and fun boss isn't enough to save a game, and unfortunately Red Faction II has little else of interest. Skip it unless you can get it REALLY cheap.Of note: If battling bots is something you like, you might be interested in Red Faction II's highly customizeable Bot-Match mode. There are quite a few maps and a great variety of weapons.			"

The World has abandoned us, We fight alone against an insidious enemy, An enemy who would destroy the Commonwealth! Who would have our nation crumble from within! But we are strong enough to fight the Red Faction, We are strong enough to prevail. You asked for greatness... I have given it to you. You asked for victory. It is within our grasp, Do not ask me to surrender to our enemies, I WILL NOT! Red Faction fanatics would enslave our sons, And ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ our daughters. I Sopot, And Patriarch of the Commonwealth, I dedicate myself to protecting the lives of our precious children. Death, Despair, Desolation, Chaos. These are what the Red Faction would bring the Commonwealth and its citizens. Our Soldiers fight for the glory of the Commonwealth, Our Workers labour for the glory of the Commonwealth, Our Children sing for the glory... Of the Commonwealth. Fight... Fight I say! Do not tell me that we cannot, we must, we must crush, The Red Faction! We cannot tolerate these Traitors in our midst. The lies of traitors weaken our nation, Destroy the Traitors!

												Another nostalgia hit for me (see my Red Faction I review if you care), from the heady days of preteen-PS2-use.On reflection - not as good as the first game in some ways. A little prettied up, more refined combat system and weapon selection and no stealth sections, but its own silly things to go with it.Probably won't recommend it off the back of that.It also has a really dumb ""trapped in sewer"" level that feels like someone in the office was trying to channel old adventure games so hard they got a nosebleed, then introduce DRECK enemies like robot jumping spiders in the subway that seem to spawn 20 a room, jump at you and wipe out your health bars.The story is... fun enough, I guess. A little cliched, but alright. Basically, be special forces for the rebels, kill the not-Hitler-not-Saddam standin, then the rest of the special forces turn on you and you have to tear into them and let the rebels win, wiping out your old squad as you go.Ran neatly out of the box, recommend engaging VSYNC in the setup menu, since not doing that in Red Faction 1 caused a lot of game bugs. Somehow physically smaller game files than Red Faction 1. Oh well.			"

												A game I used to love on the PS2 and was excited to be able to play it again on the PC.Red Faction II is the unique story of a protagonist with yellow and red armour that wages war against a communist-style government with the help of a large rebel group that assists him throughout. Later in the story he must fight his way to the new leader of the government, a man he used to work for. The government isn't the only enemy though; the protagonist must also shoot his way through hordes of creatures that used to be humans but turned into mindless zombies by the government. Lucky for our suited hero and his female companion that's great with hacking, the rebel group continue to support him despite him technically being responsible for the new oppression.My only complaint is that the game is missing a crowbar.

												This was one of my favourite local co-op games, and the single player campaign is very good too. When I saw it on sale on steam, it was a no-brainer. Many people poo-poo this as a sequel that isn't as good as the orginal. However, from my point of view - having not played the orginal - I think this is a great game in its own right.Most notable in this fps is the fact that large parts of the environment is destructible. Now that may not seem anything special, but back when this came out, it was something pretty new and exciting.The weapons are varied and enjoyable to use and watching chuncks of enemy npc's fly toward the screen is always amusing. Plus there is some notable voice acting in there, if you like that sort of thing.I would definitely recommend this game, plus it looks better than it ever did on my console back in the day.			"

												Used to play this a lot on the PS2 when it came out. There are a few problems with it, in my eyes. There's a lack of LAN/Online multiplayer, and you really only have two options for playing it: Singleplayer Campaign or Bot Matches. If you're OK with that, then that's great. I've personally had problems with connecting an Xbox 360 controller to this game (works in menus, not in matches), and a few of the maps have a different layout to what I remember from PS2. Overall, if you want to have a few quick bot matches or replay the campaign, I'd say buy it. But, if you're looking for that co-op/online battle, then look elsewhere.			"

												Rating: 6/10Overview: Run and Gun First Person ShooterThe Good:+ The game has a lot of weapon variety, most weapons have a primary and secondary function+ The game has a lot of gameplay variety. Some levels feature traditional FPS gameplay, other levels have you riding a vehicle blowing things up. + Short game, this is good because you want it to end quickly. The Average:The level design is all over the place. It ranges from boring, uninspired to sometimes confusing. The game has a lot of level destruction which is really cool except the game doesn't do a good job of telling you which walls can be destroyed and which can't. Only certain walls/objects can be destroyed which sometimes makes for a frustrating experience. Whenever I got stuck in a level I began to blindly fire rockets/grenades at all the walls around me in the hopes that one would get destroyed and reveal a path. It's a cool feature but one that wasn't executed as well as it should have been mostly because of the technological limits at the time.Graphically it looks worse in some areas than the first game.The Bad- The story, characters and dialogue are bland, boring and very forgettable. It was hard to like any of the characters, the story made no sense and I couldn't care less about what was going on, I just wanted it to end.- The first game takes place on mars and featured some varied and unique environments which made this game all the more disappointing when it takes place on earth and most of the levels feature bland office spaces or large empty areas filled with bullet sponge enemies.  - Unskipable cut scenes especially placed before frustrating boss battles. The game is pretty easy (on medium settings) but the bosses are basically bullet sponges. - Lack of quick save/quick load- Terrible 360 default controls: Either I experienced a bug or the person who did the default controller controls was tripping out on acid. Pushing the right joystick left made me walk forward, right joystick up made me walk backwards, etc. nothing made sense. Stick to keyboard and mouse.  Conclusion:Aren't sequels suppose to be better? This game takes a large step backwards. After the first Red Faction game the series had real potential to be really good. The first Red Faction reminded me of Half Life in its linear level design and pacing, this game reminds me of quick cash in and a poorly made one at that.			"

												Red Faction II (henceforth referred to as RF2) is a disappointing sequel to the original Red Faction (RF1), which I felt was easily one of the best story-driven first person shooters I played from 1994 until 2007 or so. (I think RF1 still ranks favourably with the likes of Strife and Half-Life.) Here's are the key areas in which RF 1 and 2 differ in terms of quality:RF1 features a captivating, Total Recall-inspired plot, memorable locations, and destructible environments. (Developer Volition coined that feature 'GeoMod Technology'). It's PC port was augmented with a very fun online multiplayer mode.RF2 has a decent sense of plot, but to be honest, I didn't care for it until I was on the verge of beating the game for the first time. Something in the second half of the game caused the plot to 'click' with me in the sense that I started to give a damn about the story. In fact, I felt motivated to replay the game to better understand the story and characters that I previously found dull and unworthy of my attention. For that reason, I actually enjoyed replaying the game more than the experience of taking it in as a new experience. RF2's plot is merely serviceable, whereas RF1's plot is interesting enough to keep you playing to see what happens next.RF2's gameplay is mostly fine. The limited extent to which you can create improvised stairs, entrances, and tunnels by blowing up concrete and terrain is one of RF1's major highlights. Unfortunately, this 'GeoMod' feature is so limited in the sequel that it's virtually non-existent. I found far more instances where 'GeoMod' technology could be actualized in multiplayer maps than in the single player campaign. The fact that RF2's solo campaign is far more linear than RF1's* does nothing to offset this disappointing discrepancy, and the fact that RF2 features no online or even LAN capabilities makes the multiplayer mode a tremendous disappointment. Playing RF2's multiplayer mode against bots is no substitute for playing it with real people.RF2 is one of the first games I can remember playing that features regenerating health, but it features a hybrid system that combines traditional FPS health management with Halo-esque health regeneration. To its credit, RF2's plot legitimizes the fact that the character you play has the capability to heal. Because healing occurs at a far slower pace than in Halo and the tons of clones it spawned, taking damage in battle does not feel inconsequential unless you make a contrived effort to stall the game by holding your ground after a battle.I give RF2 a score approximating 5.5 out of 10, which might be a tad generous. It's not a horrible game, but it's not worth going out of one's way to acquire. Give it a try if you invested in the Red Faction bundle, which is worth getting for RF1 and RF: Guerilla (and maybe RF: Armageddon).* = Some of RF2's vehicle-based sections literally play like rail shooters. In contrast, RF1 gives players the freedom to fully explore their environments while operating vehicles.			"

												An affront to the Red Faction name.This game is 12 years old. If you aren't tech-savvy and have a newer computer, you most likely won't like this game. Getting this game to run was frustrating, but finally solved after about a half hour.Pros:+ Excellent weapon variety+ Satisfying gunplay (sometimes)Cons:- Numerous on-rail segments- Graphics and voice acting from 2003- Lackluster ""geomod"" gameplay [1]- Unskippable cutscenes immediately after checkpoints- Annoying boss fights (bullet sponges)- Uninspired story that only makes sense if you're on drugs- Uninspired level design that ranges from dull (offices) to confusing (sewers)- No challenge on medium difficulty [2]- Extremely short at 3 hours (this might be a good thing)[1] The GeoMod technology is the cornerstone of Red Faction. Red Faction: Guerilla is considered the best of the series because of how far they took it. This game, not so much. There is no destroyable terrain, only a handful of walls that almost always need to be destroyed to progress. There was no strategy element to it as enemies always know where you are and there is no debris to take cover behind.[2] I can count the number of times I died to normal enemies on one hand. The other deaths come from annoying suicide drones that inexplicably hang out in the sewers, or bullet sponge bosses who are a war of attrition rather than skill.			"

												This game is half and half. I beat this in 2 hours, plus afk for half and hour. It seems like the devs wanted this game to run on everybody's computer. Unlike Red Faction 1, bodies dissapear, in this the damage to terrain seems toned down. It has a decent storyline, not good but not terrible. It has cool combat chunks, such as tanks and flying things. In order to run this game on windows 8 and some windows 7 computers, you need to patch it, this only takes 5 minutes. Unless your not tech savy then look it up on youtube, and it should take 10 minutes. If you can't read it will take 6 months, if you cant breathe then you probably stopped reading this and jumped in a fish tank. Over all review is 7/10.

												Red Faction II is fun, certainly, but single-player is a bit too linear and bit too short, even if the combat is engaging, well-thought out, and generally intense.It's very sad to see such failed potential. Given higher production values, tweaked and improved graphics and a freaking multiplayer mode, Red Faction II could have really been something to dig. Unfortunately, it simply has too little going for it to stack up against the endless waves of PC first-person shooters that trounce the title in so many other ways. So, it relies solely on its decent combat system and its geo-modding technology to achieve a well-rounded kind of decency that could have been so much more.			"

Wait for the Red Faction bundle to go on sale at a great price and you shouldn't be disappointed.			"

												This game took alot of effort to run on windows 7 and after playing it i realised it was not worth it. Some aspects of the game's storyline is face paced and messy i wouldn't really want to replay this game but it wasn't great. I bought this game in the THQ Bundle which was 22 games for $25. i found it satisfactory because the game was so cheap for me but if you're going to pay $10 for this you not going to have a good time.  This game was a joke. Game play was too easy  story line doesn't make sense pretty horrible 3/10			"

It has naught but a semblance of the origional and is overall: Badly written, the voice acting is horendous, the game lacks any type of atmosphere.So, If you love to put your money to having a good time, spend it somewhere else, because there is only dis-satisfaction to be had here!

												Hands on... WTF IS THIS?!??!??This is nothing like the first Red Fanction game. Good goddess I personally couldn't  even play more than a few hours of this atrocity.This ladies and gents is the poorest act of example of how some developers try their best to suck a fandoms pockets dry by making a hell of a stupid, lazyly done sequel from an awesome game.Grossly linear, stupid story line, game play that feels like a chore, an engine that feels nothing like the GEO-MOD engine the first game was built on, unskipable cutscenes, little to no destructive environments , no enjoyable physics, and complete lack of reasoning for anything that is happening since the beginning of this game.For the most people who know me here, I hardly drop a game without finishing it no matter how bad it looks.But this; this is a pure excetion, and a sign with huge letters begging you to save your time and money.Complete total disappointment, and to think that people once payed full price for this.Even in a special offer, even if it's like 50 cents. Save those 50 cents for something else. I'm not kidding. I love having complete collections of games, but I would gladly not even care buying this if I knew what I was getting into.Unless you wanna have your brain fried and your heart torn of, broken to pieces and have each piece stabbed before dipped in lemon and alcohol and light on fire, DO NO BUY THIS GAME.

I wouldn't have missed it if it weren't included.Very dated FPS in the classic Doom style, It runs well on win 8.1 but you will need to throttle the mouse way down. 3/5 for a game (and engine) of its age still playable, but in 2015 I expect a lot more. Its a 99 center if you include the DLC.  Anything more and it is a ""don't bother"".  "

												This game is divided by exactly 50/50 when it comes to the positive versus negative reviews on the store page, and it's very easy to understand why that is the case after completing it myself. Obviously, this is the sequel to the classic Red Faction game, naturally you'd expect Red Faction II to be similar to it in terms of gamepaly and story being the sequel and all, but there is little to no resemblance. Red Faction II takes place in a very different kind of atmosphere and environment to the original game and follows an alternate storyline to the one told in first game, which was a disappointment to me from the get-go as I really enjoyed Red Faction, at least the geo-mod mechanics are still there though, despite not being as flexible as before. Putting all of that aside however, I saw the game through to the end and it turned out to be a relatively fun experience overall, but I wouldn't recommend it as there are certainly better games out there for the same amount (or even less) of money. There are some bugs here and there (nothing gamebreaking however), the story and voice acting is remarkably cheesy and  there are definitely some major gameplay annoyances such as how much bullsh*t (for lack of a better word) the final boss fight is, for £5.00 it's a hit or miss experience, you'll either enjoy it or you won't. Don't jump into it expecting the gameplay to be anything like the original Red Faction 'cause you'll wind up very disappointed like I was. All in all, it can be a fun game if you play it with an open mind and strip it of it's Red Faction title, but I'd honestly recommend looking elsewhere for better games, such as jumping right into Red Faction: Geurilla instead, you won't miss out on anything.For a more informative review on Red Faction II's mechanics, story and overall gameplay, check out this review, I agree wholeheartedly with everything written there.

												Having played the first Red Faction, this was disappointing. This game is Red Faction in name only. First, the plot. It's completely goofy and too light-hearted, unlikely the gritty and dark story of the first. In the first game, you were an ordinary miner who probably had no combat experience. Here, you are a super soldier. It was so ridiculous I stopped playing midway. The plot twist you'll see in this game was just pointless. But that's the least of our problems. Here's comes my biggest gripe: lack of Geo-Mod. Seriously? The very thing that defined Red Faction is dumbed-down, almost non-existent. You can only destroy a couple of walls; that's it. This is inexcusable, especially that most of the game takes place within cities and urban areas. Geo-Mod would have been perfect here. The gameplay itself is okay, I guess. And no online multiplayer? Why, when the original RF had? You can play with bots, sure, but online should have been included alongside. As a RF game, it fails. I'm glad I got this for 99 cents. Maybe you should do the same. You want real Red Faction action? Get Red Faction 1 and Red Faction: Guerrilla.			"

												Look, if you want a better way to play this game, go get this game for PS2 or off the PSN Store for PS3. DO NOT BUY THIS ON STEAM, here's why I don't want you to buy this over Steam, when I first got a ""backup"" copy of this game on this PC, ran fine, like a charm, then I come to my senses and say ""Hey, how about I actually support the developer for once?"". Nope, not worth your time on Steam, this version on Steam doesn't support Direct X 10 Nvidia cards? Are you FREAKING KIDDING ME? That drops your marketing sales for this game for about 50% Nonetheless the endless bad mannered startup menu that wont listen to my video configuration and stays in 640x480 which is dreadful on 1680x1050 32"" LCD Monitor, and when I could play this ""backup"" copy fine and not the OFFICIAL COPY? That just tells me right there Steam, you shouldn't release older games like this EVER AGAIN on Steam, because if there is one thing wrong with it, you're not gonna contact the developers for a patch, or fix it yourselves. Just, again, get this on PS2, you can pick up 5 dollar copy of this game if you have any local shops around that sell PS2 games.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Red Faction II is a game developed by Volition Studios and originally published by the now defunct company THQ, now published by THQ Nordic (or Nordic Games) and is also the sequel to Red Faction. Red Faction II has a good if somewhat an outdated story with some fun mechanics and a variety of weaponsThe only issue I had with Red Faction II is that again there is no auto save feature, only manual saves. So if you die, you will have to go back to the latest manual save you did which could be a while and the sneaking around missions (or stealth missions) are often tedious and somewhat annoyingAn issue I had is when people talk to you, their sound levels can be drowned by the action happening around youSince Red Faction II is quite an old game, it may run poorly on some computers. It is suggested that you lock the framerate to 60 FPS because anything higher will cause some game breaking bugsAlthough Red Faction II is quite old, it is still quite a lot of fun to play! RECOMMENDED :)  "

												Really boring with almost no relation to the original game. Some of the events of RF1 get a small mention or two, but other than that there's barely any indication that RF2 is in the same universe as RF1. It doesn't even take place on Mars!You do get a lot of weapons, which is cool, but not all of them have secondary fire modes (unlike the first game). You'll only need them on the bosses anyway, who have a lot of health. You can just breeze through the rest of the game.Then there's the story... It's forgettable at best. It's also too short and too fast, so when the game tries to have even the slightest form of character development, it falls flat on its face, since 5 minutes later you gotta kill your former allies (whom you've just met).Another disappointment is that destruction is more limited than the first game.The only good thing about this game is that it's really short, so you won't have to endure it for long if you chose to play it.

												Do not play this game if you want any continuation to the good ol' Red Faction game. This one pretty short i must say, popped out after 2 years from the beginning of the series (2003). I do recommend, however to play it if you want a quick short experience on a friday after work. This game is for ppl who just want to shoot things, are enraged and don't like when they are dying ( cuz you won't die in this game, exception being some levels where you gotta pay little attention).The story? This time happens on earth and you are trying to bring down a dictator, and after you do it 2 from your squad along side with your boss betray you and the RF and then you are going to bring them down. That's it RF 2' s story in 2 rows.			"

												A very disappointing game in the series, would say its the worst of the lot. Definitely feels like a bad console port.Only reason why I got it was because it came with the red faction bundle which was on sale. Didn't like the gameplay when I booted it up and played the first mission a bit.Gave it up right after that; still gotta finish this though as I spent money on it.Would only recommend getting this as a part of the red faction bundle when its on sale. And for hardcore red faction fans, well play it. For others, you won't miss out on much if you don't play this.5/10			"

												Oh my god, this game is so bad.I don't even see how this is a Red Faction game. The red faction is worthless throughout the whole game and they just take the back seat to the story. It has no ties to the first one and it just seems like it's trying to be more like Call of Duty then Red Faction.The checkpoints are stupid. But it doesn't treally matter because the game is so easy. It took me like 3 hours to complete this game.Just play the first game.Bad game/10 "

												I turned this one on to play and I am having trouble continuing to play it. Something just feels off from the first game. In some areas tiny graphical improvements from the first, but not much. If its part of a pack where you get several games then ok... but I don't think I could suggest this one.			"

												Sigh. Disappointing. Literally not linked to what Red Faction originally was. Linear and not inspired at all. Sub-par presentation, poor level design, doesn't look terrible but in comparison the previous chapter was far more inspired. On a slightly positive note, it looks and feels more of a fps arena, but ironically multiplayer isn't an option.			"

												If Red Faction doesn't take place on Mars, is it really Red Faction?I guess the ""Red"" in Red Faction this time comes from the obvious Communist era tones in the artwork and ""for the people"" storyline. Red Faction 2 doesn't take place on Mars. It doesn't have a whole lot to do with the first game at all, really, and that's okay with me. I love/hate Red Faction. I hate it because the AI was awful, the geo-mod was not entirely impressive or overly useful, and the levels were linear and sparsely decorated. It felt like a crap Half-Life. I did, however, enjoy the couple of vehicle sequences and, for some reason, feel compelled to play through the game every now and then, if just to remind myself how much it sucks.Here's what Red Faction 2 does right; more vehicle sequences (the battle mech is particularly fun), better graphics and effects (like rain), and a more interesting story with love and betrayal. The AI still amounts to running around or standing stark still while being shot in the face. The levels are still super linear, and particularly short. Geo-mod provides some neat effects sometimes but I don't think I tore down a single building.The biggest flaws Red Faction 2 has are one particularly painful boss fight, and the game is very short. The one boss fight takes place in a cathedral, where snipers respawn in the balconies, and zombies respawn on the ground floor, and between those two you have to find time to whittle down a human size boss's lifebar from halfway across a large room. It is not fun. And the whole game, respawns and all, took me less than three hours to complete. That's Kane & Lynch 2 short.But, it is an improvement over Red Faction, even if that's not saying much because Red Faction is pretty awful.			"

												This game is after 5 years from Red Faction, where you play as a differnt character. The plot is the same, but no returning characters. The singleplayer game is very short. Only takes a full 3 hour gameplay to finish the game. The multiplayer is actually bot matches. Red Faction is better than its sequel and therefore, this game receives a 5/10 for me. *hint* Jason Statham (War, Parker, The Transporter, Safe) is a voice actor in one of these characters in the game.

												This game really reminded me of C&C Renegade with the all the vehicles you control during the game. Basiclly it was great when it came out but there is barely any story, it's even kinda laughable (the game itself isn't funny, you just laugh at it as you go). The boss battles aren't that great either since I needed to rely on bugs and glitches most of the time to win the boss fight. If you some old school FPS then this is for you, if you look for something extra then I advice you not purchasing this game. I bought it the whole RF franchise because it was on sale and I heard it was great, I guess they meant the Guerrila and Armageddon ones.			"

												Red Faction II is the sequel of the cult-classic Red Faction. however, if you are a fan of Red Faction, you most likely will not enjoy Red Faction II. in comparison, Red Faction 2 is a more simpler game, focused more on Non-stopping Action unlike the first game, the levels are more linear and the Geo-Mod features are mostly sacrificed because of the linearity of the levels, Online Multiplayer is gone and is replaced with Bot Match, the graphics are somewhat updated (if you managed to fix the 800x640 resolution issue) with better character models and locations.The Story is set on Earth five years after the events of the first game, the Nano Technology created by Alex Capek was taken to Earth and was stolen by a coalition of nations called the Commonwealth, led by a facist dictator called Chancellor Sopot and with it, he created Nano-Enhanced super Soldiers. Alias (The Player) and the rest of the Super soldiers are eventually betrayed by Sopot because of their potential and free will, causing the surviving soldiers to ally themselves with a Rebel group inspired by the Red Faction to take down Sopot.Pros- The New Weapons- Jason Staham as Shrike- Entretaining at bestCons- Characters in Bot Match lack moving strafing animations- Short, 3 to 5 hours long- Annoyingly-Hard Boss battles- Compatibility Issues regarding resolutions- Terrible Plot Twist in mid game- The use of the Nano Technology is the only plot device that connects the Story to the first game.Trivia-Multiple endings depending how many heroic bonus missions you completed or how many civilians you killed			"

												SUPER NOT AS GOOD AS RED FACTON 1Game is boring, weapons do next to nothing agsinst the bullet sponge enemies, confusing UI, the resolution settings don't do anything it just plays at 600x800, writing is bad, voice acting is worse, attles drag out too long, battles aren't even fun or interesting, setting isn't interesting it's just generic cyberpunk big city bigger corporation, the level design is meandering and doesn't give you any real direction on where to go, the enemies are annoying especially those little jumping spider things.It just feels like a totally different game than the first one, which I suppose isn't a bad thing in and of itself, but it tooks the first one which was fun, interesting, gripping, and original, and just didn't do any of that. It's not even a poor imitation because it isn't even an imitation. It's just poor.Anyways what I'm getting at is, buy the first one, buy the bundle if it's cheap, I don't care. Just don't play this one, it's just a waste of time.It looks nice though, I'll give it that.			"

												This game is bad. Like really really bad. No where near as bad as RF:Armageddon (mainly because RF:A was disappointing and not actaully a bad game). The story is nowhere to be found and pointless, the characters are forgetable (i didn't realise that I was Alias until the end, and I have no idea who everyone else is), the boss battles are... strange. For example: after working my way through the graveyard I had to defeat the woman on the balcony. Upon doing so, as I shot my rifle for the last headshot, the sound effect of the rifle was cut short, screen turned black and I was thrown into the next level. That was it. No dialogue, no explaination on how I ended up on the next area or how I ended up holding a new weapon that appeared out of nowhere. Don't get me started on that damn submarine area! The water is so bad that I couldn't see anything until I was almost dead!I am so glad I bought the RF bundle and not this game on its own. Its not a red faction game. It's nothing comapred to the first. I cant find anything good about it, and I can't be bothered to complete the last few levels.Just no.			"

												Was given a gun with almost no context, people started shooting and I shot back. +Didn't know what was going on for the first hours it was non stop fun. +Graphics and gameplay way better than the first Red Faction. Weapons looked great (for the time) and were fun to use. +Not the best game but I had fun from beginning to end. The mech sequences and the submarine were my favorites. +EDIT: It seems if you played the game while on 'steam offline mode', it doesn't record the time played accurately.			"

												This game is sooooo bad that I don't even know where to start...Enemies are stupid and often are just looped in the same state - shoot & cover. No other movement whatsoever.Plot is nonexistent. Characters are just funny in their stupidity.Only good thing is to listen Jason Statham and Lance Henriksen. But on the other side what they are saying is just crap.I am just curious why this game is called RF2 anyway?I didn't have the nerve to play it normally so fortunately for me there are cheats - so it's like Grenade Launcher + infinite ammo. This is the only way to get some enjoyment from this game.			"

												Easily the worst game in the Red Faction series, and a lazy console port to boot. The menu system is hell to navigate, and no quicksave means if you quit you'll have to sift through a dozen screens to get back to where you were. The story is 100% cliche and has nothing to do with the first game. Even the graphics are worse!It is also unforgiveably brief. After a few boring establishing levels rife with uninspired rail-shooting, you get to drive a mech for the first time. After strapping in to this supposed ""death machine"", you emerge from a garage into a small alley with an invincible enemy attack vehicle blocking one exit and an impassable cement wall blocking the other. There is no way to destroy this vehicle or exit this alley whatsoever, so I have to assume it is the end of the game. You just flail around wildly while your health is whittled down to zero. This occurs about two hours in, and is either the result of lazy development, or an ingenius message about the futility of war.Avoid like the plague. Play the enormously fun Armageddon instead if you are in the mood for a sequel that strays from the RF mythos while appropriately paying homage to it.			"

												Its a game thats typical of the time. This can be said about all the Red Faction games. They seem to chase trends with only one gimmick, some destruction of some sort, but at the end of the day it dousn't add enough to the game and the rest of the game suffers from not being very good. The best part is there is an Enemy At The Gates reference in a scene in teh game thats exactly like a scene in the movie. Most peopole would probably miss it, but it was the only point I smiled so far.Much like the first game Red Faction 2 just isn't fun and does nothing new and the GeoMod tech is not only even less used than RF1 but rather its barely used at all and is even more nerfed when it is.  I still got stuck a few times here adn there with no real idea of what to do next so I had to try and open every door I saw. Seems they still didn't get directing the player correct.  The graphics don't look better, this is probably the only thing that dousn't look better. The graphics look somewhat muddy and the guns are to big and the UI is pretty basic. I'll admit the first probably looked better.Enemies behave less irratically but they don't take cover but they will atleast attempt to find the player in situations aswell as dodge fire realistically instead of behaving like a multiplayer bot. Even then they can barely shoot and will very often stand there and let you shoot them.What it started feeling like is just me going from enemy to enemy holding shoot until the random bullet spread killed them and then moving on. The gameplay mechanics are really dull and the combat gets very boring in a hurry.Thankfully the pacing, story, and story telling are better than 1 aswell as AI and some other things but its still not a very fun or good game even with those upgrades.Its just really boring. Theres a bunch of games releeased within 6 months before or after that this one released in 2002 that are just better games. Its not a classic, its an abysmal game that people look back on with nostalgia.On another note Lance Henriksen provides the voice of the squad leader, Molov, and Jason Statham voices the vehicle expert, Shrike. But most the other voice actors are meh to terrible so you have a huge deviation between Statham and some random person thats pretty jarring.			"

												Game itself is quite fun and enjoyable.I am prevented from recommending it however, based on the appalling end fight. Ludicriously difficult and tedius.1. Small cramped arena where only cover is destructable.2. Enemy starts in a very durable vehicle, leaves, is just as durable.3. Only one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ health pack4. Unskippable cutscene (because why the hell not?)5. Utterly useless AI backup6. Cheating health doesn't work when enemy can 1 hit kill you, leading to...7. 2nd stage of fight has enemy with one hit kill weapon. You will get tagged no matter how much you strafe and jump.8. No enemy health bars, meaning you never know how close you are to victory, making it a moronic slog.Whoever designed the last part should be shot. If you're OK with skipping the ending and watching it on youtube, then this is a good buy. If you actually want a functional and satisfying ending, you won't find it here.			"

												This game is short, it doesn't have multiplayer which was kind of a bummer. The attention to detail is great with the levels and characters. The music has some roots to the first game, but it has some of it's own tracks which are phenomenal and great to listen to. The story is interesting and keeps you wanting more .  I would recommend this only to people who like singleplayer experiences since that's all you will get. At times the dialog can be kind of childish at times and make you feel like the game is trying to entertain you with simple dialog when it already achieves that entertainment with the gamplay. This is a fun game if you have played the first one. Its more polished and well  done. Its was the first one probably should of looked like. If you enjoy the Red Faction series then this is one game not to pass up.			"

RF2 is a dull, run of the mill shooter with nothing to recommend it other then Jason Statham's voicing of one of the main characters.I've finished this on my PS before but despite being deturmined to play through the entire series I'm struggling to make myself face the rest of this one...EDIT- finally finished. 4.7h, about a dozen crashes but I've finished this ugly, plotless insult  to the series. Only plus points in the whole sorry mess are Sopot's awesome rhetoric (if you don't get ""They will destroy the commonwealth"" stuck in your head while playing there's something wrong with you) and the twin machine pistols which are really fun and a nice mechanic but everything else should be lost in a deep dark chasm.

												After playing Red Faction II, I can see why this game has mixed reveiws. This game Isn't that great overall and heres some of the reasons why.Pros:+Good gameplay+Night vision+Geomod tech+Unlike the first red faction you have a more reliable squad at your back (e.g. first red faction only had a miner or two and wasn't good at doing much)+Better character development than the first red faction+Graphics are greatly improved+You can now have dual weapons (SMG's, Pistols, e.c.)Cons:-Story went to hell (In the very begenning you don't know what your doing and they don't really explain it)-Story doesn't connect to the first red faction (This would be better off being a stand alone game)-The weapon selection wasn't organized unlike the first (instead of explosive, heavy, light e.c. it's now just a scroll menu)-The controls were assigned by someone high (again).-The first main boss fight was annoying because I could barly focus on the boss (while the others are extremly easy)-Geomod technology hasn't improved in things you could destroy (you still can't destroy buildings and other things.)In the end I would give this game a 5/10The gameplay was ok (there are games that have even better gameplay) but storywise you should skip this one. If you played the first Red Faction and your going to play this one you aren't missing anything.			"

												Old, short and forgettable. This game isn't awful, but there's nothing here to draw you in. The combat is average and the destructible environments are just there to give you a new obstacle to deal with. There's nothing cool or emergent about it. The story is dull and cliched, and the writing is cringeworthy. This game isn't bad, but it's not good, either.I don't know if this is some issue with the Steam version, but there are no cutscenes, so as soon as a mission ends, you get half a second of black screen, then you're shuttled off somewhere else and stripped of most of your ammo, with no context or explanation or anything. I actually didn't realize my squadmates had betrayed me until about 10 minutes after the fact. Oops, spoilers.			"

												Run away from this, is a bad console port with one of the most moronic save system i ever experienced, worse than even the Dead Space 3 save system, it saves only at level transitions and if you leave the game, before reaching the end of the mission, that spaws several levels, YOU LOSE ALL YOUR PROGRESS, and you need to start the mission all over again. The only rediming thing on this game is the destruction system, but that do not pays for all the other bad stuff, buy Red Faction 1 instead is a much better game, and this one as no conection to it appart from the lore.

												So far this is a decently fun FPS and a bit better in every aspect than the first Red Faction in the series. I bought all the Red Faction in a bundle sale so will be playing them all. You get to drive vehicles, fly ships, subs, and pilot mech warriors. Nice!10/10 Love it!			"

												After having semi-enjoyed the first red faction (due to lack of health kits) this game completely diasppointed me. The weapon sorting system (which was fine in RF1) is altered and more dificult to get used to. The story line is pretty boring, and it's very linear.If you really want to know the storyline of the red faction games, play the first one, read about the second one, and then play Red Faction: Guerrilla.

												Red faction 2. It was an alright game. It was a much needed graphic overhaul on the original RF engine. Lots of new features, but lots of...downtones. The game has its high points and low points. High points being playability is far greater, more game types for bot matches, and customizability for the matches. Lots of unlockable stuff by playing the game too. The down points however is. Not everything is destroyable in the game. Only specific things. The game play is liniear, theres not much exploration that can go on. Its straight forward. The only thing that bothers me worse is the controls. Its aiming system in this version is pretty bad. Even with tweaking of mouse sensitivity its a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to aim. I'd recommend this game to someone else if they wanna get in on the Red Faction franchise.....Just not on the PC. Get it for PS2 or Xbox. Its not worth it on the PC, at all.			"

												Red Faction II is indeed challenging and actually harder than the 1st game. Only slight issue was its not as long as the 1st. But that doesnt matter, because when it comes to having it higher difficulty, it'll get you to pay attention. Though i just beated this on hard mode, and i gotta say. The final boss battle i couldnt breathe when i beat it.I wont go further on the details of the game, its less graphics and surely you should be able to run it. Multiplayer i havent paid attention to it, but when i do i'll probably give it a shot since i was mainly focus on the single player campaign. But nonetheless i'll try it when i feel like it.The game is also interesting than the 1st because in the 1st game, you are basically one man army. While this game, you get more help than the 1st. But regardless, there are times when you are alone.The game is quite very promising when i paid it and was well worth it. I say give this game a try and recommend anyone that is up for a challenge. Get Red Faction I if you are interested in the campaign as well.			"

												When Volition released the first Red Faction-game back in 2001, it created quite a stir because of the Geo-Mod Engine. Suddenly gamers could mould the game environment with rockets and grenades; for example, shoot holes in walls and walk through those holes; things we don’t think are particularly exciting these days.Released only one year after the first game, Red Faction II (2002), is surprisingly bad in almost every category. Most obvious is the edgy graphics and the somewhat short campaign. The story has its flaws as you can imagine. To be honest it is quite bad and you never really get to know the characters very well. I don’t know who wrote the script, but a sexual innuendo like:“Hey Alias, let’s get wet ...” - is pretty dumb coming from a female character in a sub.I had no trouble at all playing this PC-version on my Windows 8 OS. Everything worked very well. I experienced no crashes or any problems at all. (I played the STEAM-version of the game).POSITIVE:+ Voice actors Lance Henriksen and Jason Statham are fun to listen to.+ Some memorable moments.+ Easy to play and get a hang of.NEGATIVE:- Bad graphics.- Bad character control (especially the menu system).- Boring plot.I would only recommend this game to people who want to find out what happens in the Red Faction-universe.

												Unlike the first Red Faction, this game takes place on Earth instead of Mars. This game has nothing to do with the main story of the rest of the Red faction games that i can tell, it seems to be it own thing. the only thing that has ties to the first game is Red faction (both the title of the game and the people you'll be fight with, thats it). The story is forgetful, protictable, and stale.  read the ""slight spoiler"" at the bottom if you want more detailGeo mod is still here and present. it got an upgrade that the only plus side to this gameThe game is short (just look at my game play)small amount of guns are interestingI really don't recommend this game unless you want the entire red faction game, the game is on sale, the entire red faction franchise is on sale (which is how i got this game), or something to pass the time. also if you do play this game, the game will switch to high to low res and back for cutscenes to don't click when this happen or you will not be able to get back into the game, also if you have motable of monitor, the mouse will go off screen and clicking anything outside will of course take you out of the game, just reclick the game and it will not do it again till you start the game over[slight spoilers]-every body wants this special item, get stolen and stolen again. -hired super soilders comes in and does what they been hired for-Leader of the super soilder want to keep his job so he start killing everyone including you and makes more -and it your job to stop him.-did i meantion that this specail item is very improtant and only mention once.

The music has some roots to the first game, but it has some of it's own tracks which are phenomenal and great to listen to. The story is interesting and keeps you wanting more .  I would recommend this only to people who like singleplayer experiences since that's all you will get. At times the dialog can be kind of childish at times and make you feel like the game is trying to entertain you with simple dialog when it already achieves that entertainment with the gamplay. This is a fun game if you have played the first one. Its more polished and well  done. Its was the first one probably should of looked like.

												This is my favorite game in the Red Faction series outside of the fact it didn't have multiplayer. The storyline was fun, the story didn't have overused tropes, the humor could have been better (especially with Shrike) and the boss fights were challenging. The weapons had multiple abilities that made a meaningful impact on gameplay and the way you approached enemies. The enemies also felt alive in this game, as they weren't just AI roaming around in scripted paths and events. They would have conversations, make lewd comments to eachother, talk♥♥♥♥♥♥about you when you were fighting them, and it just made the game a lot more enjoyable. Overall, the game has a really industrial/cyberpunk theme to it and a pretty appropriate soundtrack.As far as the multiplayer went, it was fun playing this game in splitscreen when I owned it on the Playstation 2. The only downside to this game is that it's a port from a console version and it doesn't include all of the maps that were in the console version for the multiplayer. I believe the Xbox version had more maps than the Playstation 2 version. The AI in the multiplayer, especially if you were just playing alone just to kill time, was fun. They were challenging and not just mindless bots running around. It almost felt like an arena shooter. The gamemodes are pretty fun as well, CTF, Bagman, Deathmatch, etc etc. I would recommend this game solely so people could see the pinnacle of this game series, not the attempts made to resurrect the game years later with Guerilla and Armageddon.

												Let me start by saying I own every title for Red Faction. I've played them all begining to end. This was probably the worst out them all. With that said Ill break down what I do like about this game and what I dont like. Red Faction 2 was origianally a PS2 title. As you play you can tell how dated it is by the graphics. The Story is ok. It is very cheesy but once you get past that, you can fing your self sorta almost enjoying it. Multiplayer was the more interesting part of this game, sadly absent from the PC version it seems. You can create Ai (bots) name them what ever you want, my favorite was (beefeater). once you complete the story extra characters to play with unlock, and as do the maps. Some maps can be annoyign though as they are large with very little players, (maximum of 6), mostly searching where you or the bots are. The smaller maps provide enough chaos that your not sure where the enemy can be at times till you dead. Those are the maps that can be either fun, or frustrating. What made this game unpopular was that as you play multiplayer you'll notice that its very similar to unreal tournament. It also doesnt have alot to it, the bots run aroudn chaoticly and at times get stuck. Red faction, the first game, had geo mode in it. It is almost completely absent from this game. I have played hours with this game and my brothers which was great. the multiplay kept this game semi afloat for a while. Unless your just into having all the Red Faction titles its not really worth the $10 you'll pay for it. Red Faction 2 is the Black Sheep of the Red Faction Family. It really had  almost nothign to do with the other 3 games. I got this game in the steam package deal when i purchased the whoel collection so for how much i payed i cant complain too much. Really my only beef with the pc version of this game is the lack of multiplayer. i cant say i would buy this again if i had to.			"

												Childhood Favourite, although it took me months back then only took me 3 short hours to finish this game on pc.. Aside from that amazing game with unique gameplay unlike a lot of games today. You can see other games have learned from this game because of how awesome it truely is 10/10			"

												Certainly felt like a step back after the first game, but wasn't as dreadful as often depicted. (well maybe that particular submarine level was indeed that bad)The whole game started with a glitched cutscene, no intro, no nothing, then i realized the whole game is missing the cinematics, due to some conflict with modern systems, which is understandable, considering that the game is a decade old.Playing the game on Hard made it feel really fast paced, especially because there was an adequate amount of ammo and medkits avaliable.The saving system was dumb. Dot. If not for the replenishing health, i don't think i would've ever finished the game.Could have been better, but worth a shot if you can pick it up cheap. 5.5/10			"

												I had really low expectations of this game because it has a lot of negative comments already and the first red faction disappointed me because of the bug.. However I actually have fun finishing the game. I don't know how the first game and the second game connect its story but its okay. You will have a lot of fun with the guns, zombies, mech suits, and a lot of explosions. The story line was predictable but because of the guns. You will be annoyed though because it is really difficult even in the medium option. Enemies spawn immediately endlessly until you immediately move to another room. Zombie enemies are tough af. and the bosses as well. But I had so much fun.			"

												While not as good as the first Red Faction, the game is still fun to play. Even if Jason Statham quickly betrays you, you'll have a fun time. Oh, that's not a spoiler, that's the basic plot. There are traitors in the Red Faction, kill them and get vengeance. The GeoMod engine returns, giving you free reign to destroy whatever the hell you want, and it's magnificent. This time, there are more weapons, better sound design, more interesting level-design, and some crappy levels, less interesting story, better controls, and improved destruction.+ Improved GeoMod+ Better shooting mechanics+ Fun weapons+ Level-design+ Jason Statham+ More Red Faction lore- Some rail-shooting levels- Simple plot- Really short- Accidentally destroying your only route, making it unable to progress			"

												it's a dope game even though it's not a continues sequel of RF1 but it's hella fun bought it today and beat in one day. BTW I PLAYED THE PS2 VERSION of RF2 before getting the steam version thats why I beat it in one go lol. The end boss is a pain in the butt, you have to be moving an confuse molov to go to the other side so you may want to be strafing alot. It's only one circular room with a wall in the middle. Id say in my opinion its good game I recomend it for new players or some RF fans.			"

												A short campaign like most shooters. Those 4 hours though were one heck of a ride. There are 4 games in the series, and this particular one is the odd man out in that the main character is a super-soldier rather than a regular average Joe, and it does not particularly focus on the Red Faction. Think Republic Commando. Rather the Red Faction and the Commonwealth are pieces of the lore and the action takes place within a few hours. To sum it up, to make this game worth it, I would recommend getting it in a bundle and on sale.Rating: 8/10#Socialist Commando			"

												If you'd like to have some nostalgia about the good old arcade games, filled with senseless shooting, really rapid but still interesting storyline, you may continues the red faction series with its second game. Never mind the graphics. It is still enjoyable. Instead of reading or watching the storyline from other sources before playing the latest red faction games, witness the story yourself. Plus, jason statham's voice will make you smile.			"

												This is tough call. Is it a good game? Yes. Is it a good sequel? No.It has absolutely nothing to do with the original. It shares the name but that's where the similarities end. The story is weak and the characters and forgetable. The gameplay is enjoyable but it does one thing I think should be a crime, certain sections have enemies respawn until you pass through this section. I hate that. The geo-mod tech is hardly there.All in all, it's only worth getting if on sale. Wouldn't recommend if you want more after playing the original. Red Faction:Guerilla, in my opinion, is the true sequel.Gonna recommend...but only just			"

												I read another review that simply read ""The awkward middle child"" I won't deny that this is true. I have NO idea what's going on in this game, you're on Earth but the RF is there and you're a super soldier created by nano-tech and something about the commonwealth wherever that is on Earth. The story makes no sense, period.However, the gameplay is pretty good, I'd say for an early 2000s game. The weapons are diverse enough that you have options in a fight in the later levels.Geo-mod isn't applied as much as it was in the first RF, which is a bit disappointing.I didn't feel the need to save my game everytime I came across a new door, fearing some guy with a railgun would blow my face off the second I opened it, like in the first game. NOT disappointing.If you can pick it up on sale, I'd do it. The campaign is short, but it has multiple endings to drag you back. And there's bot-match if you're looking for the multiplayer experience.			"

												The first time I played Red Faction II was around 2004. I'm not sure when exacly, but I know that something made me mad and I haven't really finished it since then. Now that I own it here, on Steam, I managed to play it to the end - now I know the reasons.I'm big fan of the first Red Faction game. It's one of best games I ever played in both single and multi player. I played it probably for more than hundreds hours and it wouldn't surprise me if I will install it to wash off the taste of it's sequel. To keep it short: it's nothing like first Red Faction game, it can't be called even a good game. First of all, what the hell happened to Geo-Mod!? You can no longer makes yourselfs a tunnel, a hole, or anything else, in a wall and make some kind of shortcut. There are almost no random damage on the walls or floors - you can't destroy almost anything in Red Faction II. There are some statues that aren't destructable when shoot, so it's a huge let down. And while we are at Geo-Mod, I felt like idiot playing this game. There are only few times when you NEED to destroy something and no, you can't to find out it yourself. There will be always hole on the wall or somewhere else saying ""hey you, look, there is a path here, destroy a wall here and see how fun it is"". That's not what I would ever see in sequel of the great game, the game from times when there were so many interesting ideas and devs weren't affraid on making them come to life.Another big ""boo"" for Red Faction II is lack of the multiplayer option. There are bots only. They did great in the first game and even NOW (yes, in the 2017) there are active players enjoying first Red Faction with others. Why skip it in sequel? Sure, there are some interesting options, you can follow progress and stats for every game mode and all but there comes one question - FOR WHAT REASON? I don't think anyone would want to brag about making beating bots. Sure, you can, but it's just boring.There comes the third one, next ""are you kidding me?"" thing. Spawn of the enemies. There are moments in the game when they will SPAWN behind the barricade on the middle of map, there are moments when you will turn around and somebody will shoot your back - yes, looks like enemy spawned when you wasn't looking, lol. And the most annoying, at least for me, was the moment when you needed to kill some snipers and just when I gotten rid of all of them boom, here comes another wave from HIDDEN ON THE SAME PLACES, STAYING AT THE SAME POSITIONS. Sure, it's really old game looking at the date when it first come out, but I don't remember this kind of stuff in previous Red Faction game.If you are fan of the Red Faction first game, then don't even bother to play this one. I mean, it's not made with only bad stuff. The graphics are something that you would expect in the game from 2003 year, same about the music, videos and such. There is really interesting arsenal of weapons and two-wielding was somehow rare in games, so Red Faction II did it great. Maybe the game itself isn't really long (it took me around 3 hears to finish it) but there are also bonuses like concept arts, which are unlocked if you play the game on all difficulty levels, earlier mentioned ""multiplayer"" with bots. Play it only when you don't mind all of the negative stuff and if you just looking for some short shooter - which finished once, can be forgotten forever...			"
