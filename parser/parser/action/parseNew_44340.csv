												I decided to point out the best and worst elements in this game in a quick summary:The good:- This game could be really fun for a 4 Player Co-op. But I never tried that.- Bullet drops are accurate and satisfying.- Visuals still hold up okay, specially in later levels (I might be easy to please in this case). The mountains are neat.- Good length for the Single Player considering recent games in the genre.- The Briefing before any mission is nice. Really loved the soundtrack giving you a ""danger"" feel before going to battle.- Level of customization for different sets of classes. You can level them up and get new perks.- You can give orders to each soldier in your squad. It's great to flank enemy positions, suppress and ambush if you take the time to understand how it works.- No health regeneration. If you get shot you need to stop the bleeding first then patch up- You can get killed with one or two bullets.The Bad:- The AI is a hit or miss. Either they can be effective or they warn you to not shot because they are going to be in front of you. This happened more than it should.- It requires Games for Windows Live if that' is an issue/deal breaker for you.- Because the Story is focused on one area, there's not much variety when it comes to different war scenarios.- Checkpoint can be cruel at times considering how easy it is to be killed. Most of them are fine, however.- Responsiveness from your AI when you order them to enter a vehicle can be really slow.Best Knox quote:""I'm going to beat you so hard that not even Google will be able to find you.""

												I played this game on a laptop on a combat outpost in afghanistan.  I loved it at the time.  Maybe because I didnt have anything else to do in my free time but play cards.  If you are patient it can be very enjoyable.  I give it a 7/10.  Notice all of the bad reviews come from players with less than 2 hours of playtime.  You cannot learn how to play this game in less than 2-3 hours imo.  It probably takes longer than that.  Give it a chance.			"

												Operation Flashpoint: Red River is kind of like a mixture of ArmA, MOH and Ghost Recon. You command your fireteam (like GR) except in a more complicated way similar to ArmA (stance, dispersion, noise dicipline etc.) There are ArmA features like bullet drop, the importance of stance when aiming, military jargon that is relevant to the task and some adherence to military tactics. The AI (unlike ArmA) are actually somewhat lifelike, and they behave much like the AI in say MOH BF3/4 and GR. Unfortunately, the environment isn't breakable (like BF3/4), however you can reduce buildings to rubble with high explosives but that is it. Suppressors aren't that useful because of the way the campaign is played (open ground and daylight) but fortunately they do not reduce damage like in some games. The weapons are rather innacurate, almost to the point that they are unusable. The M4A1 carbine is good for distances up to max 20m away (the ACOG magnifies too much). The M249E2 SAW is about the same. The MP5A4 is good for targets up to 10m away. The M14 is best with the Leupold Mk 4 because the ACOG sits too far forward on the weapon and the peripherals interfere. The M107 is useful for any range, but if targets are within 100m, then aim using the graduations above the middle of the crosshair. In conclusion, I would recommend it to anyone. It's fun by yourself (the AI are competent) and fun with friends or even strangers (the online community are quite pleasant).			"

												Literal dogshit.Operation Flashpoint: Red River is the final installment in the Operation Flashpoint series.I go way back with this series. The original Operation Flashpoint was my favorite game in High School. Cold War Crisis (Now called ArmA X: Cold War Assault) was a brilliant milsim. It was a difficult and wonderfully rewarding experience.Now, this is where things take a turn for the strange. Codemasters and Operation Flashpoint's developer, Bohemia Interactive Studios, had a falling out. Codemasters owns the Operation Flashpoint license, so they name stayed with Codemasters. BIS went on to make Armed Assault: Combat Operations, or ArmA. The original ArmA (as in ArmA 1, not ArmA CWA) was lukewarm in reception. It had loads of issues upon launch. This left people wondering perhaps that Codemasters could make a better game. So, they tried with Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising.Now, simultaenously, BIS was going to try again with ArmA 2. BIS made a lot of good decisions and even released a demo of ArmA 2. ArmA 2 came out a few months before Dragon Rising. There were still complaints about performance issues, but over all ArmA 2 was a huge hit. Dragon Rising received no demo before release. Infact, it got a demo a month after. Dragon Rising did feature a better performing engine than ArmA 2, but that was about it. The game even had a mission editor on PC, but it was inferior to ArmA's. In all, I actually enjoyed Dragon Rising a lot, but it's inferior to ArmA 2 in so many ways. The majority of issues that plagued it could be centered around the fact that it was a pretty weak console port to PC.Now, Red River is more of the same bad, but none of the good. I wish I could go into more detail, but Red River boils down to this:-Get briefed by a gruff Staff Sergeant-Scripted shooting gallery section with weak feeling weapons and the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ set of mouse sensitivity in an FPS. You need to have it maxed in order for your view in the iron-sights to have any usable movement. How ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ were you, Codemasters?-Deal with dumbed down AI. Literally. Prick-in-Command Sion Lenton outright said the AI in Dragon Rising was ""too good"" at some points. The ♥♥♥♥ planet are you from? Now, enjoy being able to run through a door filled by a Tajik insurgent, get behind him, and shoot him in the back as he menaces you.-Get back in vehicles for additional banter.One hallmark of Flashpoint, vehicle control, is gone. In a quote from ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ supreme Sion Lenton, he stated that ""Marines don't fly""  despite the USMC operating the 5th largest Air Arm in the world.Instead, you're treated to a Call of Duty level single player and co-op experience.Literally, it's pretty much Call of Duty single player.This game is one you should pass on without a doubt.If you want tacticool shooting, pick up any of the ArmAs, the original Ghost Recon, and Ravenshield.If you have those and still want more, Dragon Rising isn't awfulThis is. Skip.			"

												Despite bad name and fame (thanks to Zion Lenton and CM franchise theft), it's a really good game. I mean... In single player You'll most likely get annoyed by not-so-smart fireteam AI which is more artificial than intelligent, BUT... It is a GREAT if You play it with friends. Challenging, FUN and it's a pretty good baby of the dead genre: team-based military tactical shooters. There are a few quirks (like annoying anim-desynchro, which occurs rather rarely) and it shouldn't be called ""Operation Flashpoint"", but if You have some buddies to play with and miss some 'lighter"" alternative for ARMA, it's a must-have.Overally:Gameplay - 9/10Video - 7/10Audio - 6/10Replayability - DecentValue for money - Good			"

												Honestly this game is good. Don't look at it as though it's to be ARMA3 or BF4 cause it simply isn;t. It's a great game honestly, fun story, true with virtually no storyline but really does it need one? The graphics are certainly very nice and contrary to some reviews the screenshots show it off rather well. And what clunky controlls? I don't see it, it seems better than many other games, I'd would MUCH rather play this than COD.			"

												Ah, Games for Windows Live. We meet again. For those who don't know, GFWL is a third-party DRM platform, notorious for it's poor design and the way in which it makes you jump through hoops to simply play the game you paid for.It takes so much hassle to get the game running on a Windows 10 PC. I had to delete files, mess around with compatibility settings and more before I could get the thing working. Do not buy unless you really feel like messing around to get it working. This really shouldn't be available on Steam in my opinion.			"

												This game is a strange mix between battlefield and rainbow six. The graphics are far from todays AAA titles but are in no way a hinderance to gameplay. Each class has an extremely different playstyle that I was completely surprised by because if you try to fill another role such as close combat with an automatic rifleman it will not work out as well as trying it in other class based games. The combat is fun but punishing and each kill is rewarded with not only class exp but a sigh of relief that it wasn't you who caught a bullet especially in close combat or urban areas. Teamwork is essential and without a team you are truly nothing against the enemy. Great game at a great price for its content its just too bad that the DLC is only on the microsoft marketplace.			"

												I've seen a lot of people compare this to Arma or Battlefield, and then say this game is rather dissapointing. The game is more like MoH or CoD, in the sense that it isn't openworld, and the missions are very linear. Where it differs from MoH or CoD however is in the gameplay. Unlike you're generic FPS military game, you are not a walking tank that can run through the battlefield taking little to no damage whilst wreaking havoc on your enemies using an array of weapons. In OF you have 4 distinct classes, with different weapon setups, and by playing as the classes you can unlock different weapons to use and more customization options, none of which however are capable of running and gunning through the battelfield due to how easy it is to be killed. Even on normal you can get killed in as few as 2 bullets. Due to this the gameplay is a lot slower paced than other FPS games you may be used too, but it is still very enjoyable. Personally I found it a nice change from the standard FPS games. The story however is rather dissapointing. It's your standard military story where you are in a foreign country trying to restore peace by killing anything that moves, and overall the story is forgettable.Now one of the major downsides to this game is the need to install Games for Windows Live. Youll need to install the GFWL client seperatly from the windows/xbox site before being able to launch the game, and you will need to sign into an Xbox live account in order to play co-op/multiplayer and to be able to save your progress. It's important to note however, that the multiplayer and co-op is still functional despite GFWL not being supported anymore, which is a good thing since the game is a lot more fun to play with friends as the AI squadmates generally are not very useful. The graphics have not aged well and even back in 2011 when the game was launched the graphics weren't that great, and the game isn't optimised that well for PC. With that being said though, the game is still a lot of fun to play, and has a lot of gameplay value, especially for its current low cost. I'd give OF:Red River a solid 7/10 PS: The game plays a little smoother with a xbox controller over keyboard and mouse, but is still playable with them if you don't happen to have a controller. Also GFWL may not be getting updated anymore, but it works fine, so people should stop complaining about the game and giving it bad ratings based on this one thing.			"

												Despite there being many perfectly valid criticisms thrown its way, I have to say I still like it. For once - it doesn't have regenerating health - instead, you bleed until you patch yourself up (and then use the the infinite medkit you have, but I guess life isn't perfect). The main problem with it is that it took on the name of a franchise reknowned for its focus on vehicle use and squad (i.e. 8-10 people) tactics taking place in a large open environment. People unfamiliar with the Flashpoint name wouldn't care if Codemasters just called it ""Red River"" and those who are ended up brewing a turn storm around the game. Other flaws include glitchy grapchis and overall shoddy optimization, but not to the gamebreaking level. Character models look nice, with lots of detail on the marine characters, missions take place across large patches of terrain, and although you are confined to a certain area battlefield-style, it rarely becomes an issue. Missions also sport long rides in the back of a humvee, where the only thing you do is listen to the tutorial voice in the form of your platoon's staff sergeant. These rides are tedious, but wrighting is decent and the guy is genuinely hilarious  at times (provided you've ever been in the military or are a fan of Generation Kill), and he reminds me of a sergeant in my old unit.Speaking of Generation Kill - both this game and the previous one (Dragon Rising) rip entire dialogues straight out of the show - I guess they ran out of creativity half-way through writing the story.Most annoying of all - the AI. While friendlies can take a little getting used to, but once you get the hang of commanding them they can be made to function, the enemy AI all graduated from the Tajik special ed class and handed an AK - they either stand in the same spot doing nothing or run towards you. Taking cover is also an overly complicated concept for them. Not only that, but they take damage like a china teacup in a bull arena - you'll be lucky to kill one before he♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥himself on a thornbush and bleeds to death.All in all, the game feels very reminiscent of the Brothers in Arms games, except that actual terrain was used for the levels instead of them looking like a collection of conveniently placed chest-high walls. But I wish they ripped a few more elements off that franchise as well, like the gun accuracy and sway, and maybe the unlobotomized AI while they're at it.			"

												I found this game hard to get into and yet it turned out to be one of my most favourite military shooters (even though it is not solely a shooter but more of a tactical one which will turn off the generic FPS player). The campaign was solid and kept me wanting more and towards the end it got so intense and I grew to like the whole team. The execution was done really well, the weapons, levelling up and choosing the right guns for the right mission was fantastic. Especially having to do a fighting retreat but also it needed to be tactical and not just run back and randomly shoot. You need to carefully take your shots and have support and cover. The enemy can have seriously good accuracy and you don't just cop 20 rounds to the chest and regenerate like you're Wolverine. I would say that this game was an experience that was rare to find in this day and age. Great shooter, great gameplay, sound quality was solid and the voice acting was very good!			"

												This game was on discount when I bought it. And yes, I did read several forum posts. There were loads of horror stories on the forum. However, I thought that three dollars wouldn't be a big deal right? I mean, Codemaster's a fairly well-known group; they won't screw up anything important, right? Oh boy, was I wrong...My first 30 minutes was graced with a horrendous setup process, GFWL, DX installation, unintuitive interface. GFWL was particularly painful, this is simply a stupid choice for online gaming, there's a reason no other game uses it. Beyond that, I was frustrated with a soundless game and random crashes. It took almost an hour for me to get into the first level, and what greeted me was a satirical loading cut-scene with overly loud sound, a far-cry from my previous hour of silence. After that, the game just blacked out, no sound, no sight, nothing.Following my incredibly frustrating experience, I decided to contact the Codemaster support team. To my surprise, they responded within a day, not bad for a partially ""defunct"" studio. However, the response was short and extremely unhelpful. I was told to restart my game and replug my headset, something that I've done more times than I'd like to. At this point, I was ready to give up. My friend made the same purchase on the very same discount event, only to find the game failing to install, and later, incapable of starting up.I didn't even touched on the gameplay, graphics and storyline, but the hour I spent was more than enough to persuade me against my hastily made purchase. The game might be a gem, if it actually runs. But in my case, it clearly didn't.Update 1:After reading several other reviews and watching some gameplay videos, I am glad to not miss out any groundbreaking contents. Graphics and audio are generally the same as Dragon Rising, which is to say, 2009 technologies in a 2011 game. Gameplay itself suffers too, with less than optimal AI, linear level designs and poor weapon modeling. Lastly, the story is nothing to write (if there's any written in the first place) home about. You typical B movie plot, the swearing sergeant, evil Chinese army and a seemingly elite squad, who in the actual game, are incapable of climbing into Humvees.Update 2:Hell, even the uninstallation failed. The first time I tried to uninstall it crashed Steam. It took more than 10 minutes on the second go to fully remove this POS.Conclusion:Codemasters are not the masters of coding. "

												This review will focus mostly on the negative sides of the game, it doesn't mean that the game is bad, I just talk about the negative  things more.I have no idea why do people compare thisto ARMA or Battlefield. This game is totally different than the first Opflash. People should do  some research before purchase instead of blindly buying games then complain about them. This is not an open world or überrealistic  game. It's an arcade shooter just like COD or MOH.The graphics are not the best but they are totally okay. The optimization is not too  good, eats a lot of resources while the visuals are not too satisfying. There is one effect I really loved though - the sun flare. OMG this  game has the most beautiful sun flare I've ever seen! It's a real eye candy, I wish more games would have it. Overall the places are a  bit bland because you are somewhere in Tajikistan. This game was made for consoles anyway so yeah the maps aren't too interesting.  It has some nice lanscapes and nice sky though.The shooting is really satisfying. It feels good to shoot with the rifles. Yes, only the rifles because there is no use of smg or shotgun.  The reason is simple: there is no close-quarter mission, there are no indoor missions and the enemy is in long range most of the time.  The gadgets are useless too. It takes ages to switch to a grenade, the tripmine has no use at all - the enemy is only approaching from  front most of the time.You have to choose your class, I played it through with the scout class, you can unlock all kinda cool snipers and scopes. But you  can only attach the nightvision scope to a sniper, so you cant put it to M4 etc. The story is... well I couldn't care less about it. I did not understand most parts because of all that soldier talk. I had no idea what was  an APC until I googled it. So maybe you would like the story if you are into military talk and all that stuff. The leader of the squad is an  assshole. He talks waaaay too much and the way he talks is very irritating. He is a wannabe-tough guy, really makes you say the n-word. Your sqad is quite weird. They are not too bright so it's recommended to play in coop with at least one human squadmate. They  are cute though. Many times they are rushing to heal you. But they never heal themsleves. So you may find yourself babysitting them. Giving them orders is useless. The only orders I've used is hold position and follow me. This game is not a tactical one. Doesn't matter  how bad it will look like a tactical game, it's simply not. The game has some bugs, you will encounter some but for me they were funny most of the time.Anyway, the game is REALLY fun. After all those negative things I've listed it's a very good game I don't care what people say. I  enjoyed every bit of the game. I've played with a coop partner and it was very awesome. The game lenght was satisfying, the ending  was not.I really recommend it to all my friends to give it a try. The replayability is high, because you have the chance to max all the classes and  unlock cool weapons and perks. I've played it through as a scout, it was really awesome. If you are looking for a good coop game,  look no further. I enjoyed every minute of it (except mr.assshole's rambling). It's different from most of FPS games because this game is  representing the missions in a more realistic way. I recommend it to everyone who is sick of ww2 nazi killing clichés and want to play a cool FPS in modern setting.PS: The menu music is incredible.DEFEND DAT TAYLOR!			"

												The game forces you to use Live. However, in my attempts to create a live profile while the live service wasn't working, the game associated my cd-key with a non existant profile and I am now unable to play the game I bought at all. The developer was unable to help and pointed me to microsoft for support. However, the support page for Live no longer exists because Microsoft no longer supports the platform.I don't recommend buying this title unless you really like looking at the loading screen.			"

												Yes, Windows live SUCKS, but it didn't stop me from playing this, though it does load slow and awkwardly. BUT, if you like Operation FLashpoint or Arma then chances are that, just like me, you'l HATE this game too. This game is NOTHING like other O.F or Arma games. It's just a dumb ""shoot 50 guys in 2 minutes"" mindless shooter. It has EXTREMELY linear gameplay, really holds your hand the whole time and gives you no say in tactics. It has almost no realism which is why I bought the damn thing. Got shot 5 times? It's ok, just kill the 40 guys coming at you and then patch yourself up and it's like nothing happened. But worst of all, the Staff Sargent is the single most f***ing annoying and chiched ""angry black guy"" character I've ever seen. I kept shooting him in the head to shut him the hell up, but nope, have to sit through the crap. Ended up muting it during the LOOOOOOOOONG cut scences. Gave up on mission three. A total waste of money "

												The hours I've logged on Operation Flashpoint: Red River are actually from playing the campaign once and a half. I've been into FPSs for a long time, and while OF:RR may not have aged well in its looks, the gameplay is actually really solid, and if you're playing with the AI teammates, they're not terrible (like a lot of FPS AI tend to be). As far as cons, I'd probably point out the lack of enemy AI; they don't use cover so well and they tend to be a little unpredictable as far as whether or not you'll get shot in the face the millisecond you see them or if it'll take them a full ten seconds to pepper you. If you like FPS, OF:RR offers a satisfying campaign and solid mechanics, and for that I certainly recommend giving it a try. Don't worry too much about the visuals.			"

												This game is brutal. In a bad way. Before every mission there's a short briefing which is informative and skippable. But after that there's a second run-down of the plan where you get screamed at in military slang for what sometimes feels like 15 minutes by some racist black guy. Everything he says is completely useless, especially after already having gone through the first briefing, and you can't skip over this idiot. Combat is confusing and repetitive. While its nice to be able to order your unit around and have such an array of orders to give, I think you've been left in charge of the 'special needs' platoon. They're slow and often need you to input the same order multiple times. Further for combat, there is very little indication from which direction you're being shot. And when you're being swarmed with enemies, having every platoon ai screaming about gunners at whichever location doesn't really help. Overall, It runs well, although for a 2011 game the graphics look like garbage and probably don't require much anyway. I don't remember how I came to own Operation Flashpoint, but I sure hope I didn't spend more than a couple dollars on it.			"

More or less detailed review of each mission of the singleplayer campaign in the comments section, due to character limit (chronologically starting on the last page).Pros:-stable framerate-you can turn off angry edgy teenager music from the early 2000s via audio options-you can mute Knox and everybody else-you can quit the game-ALT-TABBING out, doing some office work, ALT-TABBING back in works flawlessly (i'm looking at you SOURCE ENGINE!)Cons:-Windows Live integration.You can create a local only profile (without which you could not even save your progress!),but that doesn't prevent the game from showing the nagging Windows Live online registration overlay each and every time you run the game-you can skip the intro movies and briefing videos, not with ESC, as any sensible PC user would intuitively think, but with ENTER-advanced graphical settings are available only from the main menu, not during the actual game (which makes tweaking tedious)-you need to restart the game after adjusting certain graphical settings (which makes tweaking tedious)-not doing so can result in graphical glitches, such as weird lightmaps (which makes tweaking tedious)-very noticeable LOD popping-needlessly low-res textures even on high settings-occasional hiccups when large amounts of enemies are spawned-lip-sync errors (especially Knox, oh wait, the others don't talk, only talk over radio or have their lips covered with a rag)-you have to HEX-edit a config.dat file in order to adjust the terrible default FOV-annoying visual style in menu and ingame (""Databending""/""Glitch Art"")-auto-aim capabilities (which were immediately turned off, so if they were executed badly, i wouldn't know or care)-horrible mouse sensitivity, it feels like you're aiming with a stick on a controller,no matter how much time you spent tweaking-perks (""PLAYER PROGRESS"") and unlockables (""CLASS SETUP"")-ammo crates every 50m (in OFP:DR you had to scavenge dead enemies and loot their ammo crates, if you were lucky enough to find something in them)-unlimited field dressings-if you switch back and forth between weapon/equipment XY and any type of launcher, you have to watch the loading animation,regardless of the launcher having been previously loaded already-300 reference (just lame)-navigating the menus seems to work with KEYS instead of MOUSE at first glance,but you can actually click on the various ""OperationXY{KEY}"" labels to navigate without keys, also MOUSE2 is the same as ESC,which is by far the most confusing and inconsistent design of menu navigation i have witnessed so far, only matched by OFP:DR-the default control config is lousy (CAPSLOCK!11!!eleven) but at least it's reconfigurable-no option to switch between ""hold m2 to aim down sights"" and ""click m2 to toggle aiming down sights"",same thing with crouching-bringing up the command menu for issueing orders to your squadmates prevents you from moving-the commands themselves are very basic both via the command radial menu and the command map menu-binocular use prevents you from moving-going prone, especially on slopes, can be glitchy, and aiming while prone can be fidgety sometimes-enemies will rush to the aid of wounded nearby, regardless of the situation,which can result in up to a dozen easy kills-friendly AI is too daft to patch themselves up, yet when they are set to follow or stay put andyou approach them to do it for them, they often will run away from you, even right into enemy fire-Alpha and Charlie Squad Leaders are invincible and have unlimited ammo-enemy weapons often disappear within seconds and other times stay in place for minutes-you start every mission with the fire mode ""fully automatic"". Which is, you know, great for preserving ammo and accurate shooting...why can't the game remember the fire mode i use most of the time,or even simpler, remember the state of fire mode i had selected when i finished the previous mission?-in singleplayer, it would have been practical to pause the game while accessing the mapbecause selecting and ordering individual squadmates via map is clunky and tedious (lazy console port syndrome)-briefing is done thrice,1) in text form in the pre-mission screen2) in a cheesy pacmanesque video narrated by ""Col. Hardaway"" who sounds like a bi-polar, black old man(turns out he actually is a black old man, goes by the name Al Matthews and is apparently a vietnam vet turned singer, actor, narrator)

In essence, this character is like a crossbred between Full Metal Jacket's Sgt. Hartmann and all members of N.W.A.,white COD-loving boys from the suburbs between 12 and 26 of age cream their pants when a black man can say all the dirty and bigoted things they can't.-despite all the PR about giving your squadmates an intrigueing and deep identity, so that they are no longer the anonymous cannon-fodder from OFP:DR,they are actualized so bland and faceless, i didn't even care to remember their names-during the missions themselves the game grabs your hand and never lets you go,there is nothing left of the sandboxy freedom of the original OFP in achieving an objective,this is just a badly disguised corridor shooter on rails-as the corridor theme suggests, enemies spawn when you touch an area trigger or more complex conditional/timed scripts run, or a combination of all three,so most of the time you don't have the opportunity for long range engagements, instead enemies you see and shoot are less than 100m away most of the time,which is such a disgrace for a so-called ""Operation Flashpoint"" gameSeems like Codemasters realized, after releasing OFP:DR, they still left a few tidbits of fun and a remote resemblance to the original OFP in the game.""Oh snap! We were trying really hard to f--- up OFP:DR, but it just somehow turned out to be actually playable!"" Sion Lenton cried out.""We must try again, but this time we have to make sure to stamp out everything that could somehow be associated with OFP.Also, let's make everything that was criticised about OFP:DR (FOV, UI, AI, map size etc.) exactly 201.705% worse.Once we have accomplished that, we can force this half dead shell of what once was OFP to reproduce with the idiot twin of COD:MW2.This should result in the incarnation of an entirely unenjoyable stillbirth of a game.And the name of this unholy creature shall be 'REVIR DER!""Well done, Codemasters!http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6xg89C6gmc	Mission 01:No words.

												I want to be honest about this game...I expected a tough game kinda ""close"" to the reality, since all the ""pros"" from ArmA, Battlefiled and♥♥♥♥♥♥ said: ""i played OFP i know how to play a tactical shooter, shut noob you cant deal with my 1337 skillz.""This game didnt meet my expectation...Lets make a list of disapointments:-your weapons spread is that awful, you cant hit a dude 100 meters/feet away... upgrading was never mentioned and it doesnt help much-the AI is stupid as hell standing like 5 mins in front of your/enemy mgs ignoring all orders to move away-you are forced to drive around in a car in most missions, doing nothing while listening to some seargent who constanly drops BS sentences, swearing in every single sentence. the other soldiers arent much better-getting shot means you stand around for a few seconds open for another hit-the graphics didnt really improve, dragons rising looks kinda the same-the scenery doesnt change, well its a desert...-the only mission i would replay is the last one, it created some soldier feeling, the other missions are boring...-the checkpoints are fine in most cases, but being forced to walk 1km/mile again or waiting 10 mins again is frustrating-you can heal yourself from all kinds of injuries, except death and being shot down, in a few seconds is fine, but the AI ignores this feature and you need to heal them every few minutes if you want your team to fight with you-the screenshots certainly look better than the game on maxed out settings-the story looses its sense as soon as the chinese invasion begins...-GfWL is down, so no easy multiplayer-enemy has lazers, while you shoot peas... range doesnt matter -your AI kills YOU from time to time...I always try to find some + points for a game, this game made it hard:-the game has only 10 missions, thank [insert deity]-the upgrade/loadout system is quite goodTHE SHUTDOWN OF GFWL DOES NOT PREVENT YOU FROM SAVING THE GAME. JUST CREATE AN OFFLINE PROFILE.with that said, i cant recommend this game, probably only its predecessors.I havent played them enough to form an opinion			"

												It's hard to recomend a game like this. Operation Flashpoint has alaways been closer to a tactical military shooter than an arcade shooter like COD. The game tries to blur the lines between arcade and tactial, but fails to really do so. The commands are awkwardly placed on the CAPS Lock key and use WASD to issue. This means that to issue a command you have to completely stop moving, look at your target, hit an unusual key and than select your command. There's also no way to issue individual commands like in previous games. A common strategy is to place a heavy gunner, LMG, on suppressive fire, a sniper on overwatch and than send one soldier to flank right or left while you flank the other direction. However since you have to command the entire team the best you can do is supprese and you flank or send them one way and you go the other. Another problem with the game is Staff SGT. Knoxx. I get that he's a Marine and the game is tryingto symbolize a military shooter but I've never heard anyone, Marine or otherwise, with as foul a mouth as him and I'm military. He began to irritate me right off the bat and never got better. It got to the point where everytime he started talking I just muted my TV so I wouldn't have to listen to the gutteral trash the developers think we talk like. Can I recommend this game? No. No I cannot. However I can recomend Operation Flashpoint Dragon Rising for those of yo looking for a good tactical FPS.			"

												What I've always appreciated about the Operation Flashpoint games is that you really aren't the hero of the game. You're just another cog in the wheel surrounded by other cogs in the wheel of a fully functional fighting team. Red River is the third (and maybe last in the series) and I really enjoyed it. You're a marine fire team leader thrust into a conflict in a fictional desert country on the border of China. You take control of three AI squad members who you can give simple orders to. You can flank, suppress fire, hold positions etc. When given the opportunity you'll have access to mortar fire and airstrikes. The complaints about the AI being pretty dumb are unfortunately pretty spot on. Guys will run in front of you, I've had armor wipe out my team and I was run over by HMMWVs more than once. Graphics are servicable and the maps are large but you're also given checkpoints that tell you where to go so they feel limited in that aspect.  Mission variety...well you're in a fire eam so you're going to take and defend buildings, rush the enemy, destroy AA etc. There's a mission where you're falling back position after position because wave after wave of enemies are coming to get you. It can be frustrating but satisfying when you finish. The gunplay is a bit different since you have to account for bullet drop etc. It gets a bit easier as you go along since there's a level up system which allows you to put points towards gun handling, accuracy etc. There is an absolute ton of voice acting and while there were times it was a bit much I didn't mind it too much. Whoever played the Staff Sergeant was very good and reminded me of some of my leadership when I was in the Army. I also got lucky because I had zero issues with the GFWL setup. Saves worked perfectly and got plenty of achievements.  Overall I recommend OF: RR. OF: Dragon Rising is still the superior game but I've seen where you can get both games for $5. That's a great deal. 7.5/10 from me.			"

												After a somewhat insane intro cinematic made in Prezi by a Tea Party member on a mescaline binge, I was insulted repeatedly by a hilariously racist black man pretending to be a Marine Corps sergeant for the sin of completing the tutorial faster than he could give me instructions, then herded into an open-topped Humvee to go drive to an abandoned town to clear it of insurgents.  Finally, some action, I thought, and continued to think as we drove down the road, Staff Sergeant Knox jabbering in my ear in an incoherent stream of misunderstood military jargon and barely comprehensible profanity.  Eventually, we reached said town, and I disembarked with my men, charging into battle, finally free of SSgt. Nutsack as my three bot companions lingered by the humvee, refusing to move.  Fortunately, the enemy were similarly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and walked about in the open like cardboard cutouts of vaguely Arab people on a really crappy firing range, and despite my horrendously awful-looking rifle's attempts to make me miss by spontaneously making me stand still or jumping about due to a bird flying in the next continent, I was able to remove the threat.  Upon returning to the convoy, SSgt. Non-Judicial Punishment insulted me again, whereupon I shot him in the head and the game crashed, which I think means I won.  12/10, buy it for someone you hate.

												Alright, that's it... I can't stand this anymore. I've played five missions (out of ten) and... I just give up. Why? Well, I'll tell you why!* The AI is F*CKING STUPID!* The environments are all brown.* The story is something about americans attacking a small country in the middle east... yadda-yadda-yadda. Stopped paying attention after the first mission.* The missions are all the same, at least the missions I played.* The controls, especially the aiming, are terrible.* The game doesn't run properly. What I'm talking about? Well, the first time I ran the game (after installing it) it worked perfectly. Next time... didn't run at all. The exe file stopped responding. Had to re-install Games for f*cking Windows Live EVERY SINGLE TIME I was to play the game and still it didn't work every time I did that.Oh, by the way, there's NO point in healing the other squad members while playing alone. In the beginning (first two missions) you do it but then you realise that if a squad member dies... he'll just respawn when you reach the next checkpoint! Well, what's the use then?!This game is worthless. I liked ""Dragon Rising"" but I can't recommend this game to anyone.			"

												Not nearly as fun as Dragon Rising, and definitely not as fun as Arma. The complex management systems that make First Person Military Simulators fun have been stripped down to ""Shoot there,"" ""Move to a place,"" and a few other basic but relatively pointless commands. Your squadmates are largely a warning system for when enemies are nearby but you haven't spotted them quite yet. Friendlies will open fire in the direction of enemies, but will account for 1 in every 7 kills or so, if you're lucky.If you want a dumbed down squad-management shooter, or you want to build your way up to the complex system Arma offers, get this game on sale. If you like Arma, or you like shooters in general, give this a pass.			"

												Half of Red River is inaccessible due to Microsoft abandoning their GFWL service that this game is tied to, meaning all online features are blocked. Upon exiting the game I was greeted with a black screen across my dual monitor setup, forcing me to hard restart my PC.The campaign's major cutscenes are a mix of slideshows and kinetic typography, something obviously made in After Effects. The poor choice of adding a ""wiggle"" expression to every parameter makes it very difficult to watch due to motion sickness. I hate that there are introductory tutorial levels in so many FPS games, one of the most popular, and oldest, video game genres. I've been playing FPS for over 25 years, at least give me the option to skip this. I can read the keybindings if I ever get lost. The FOV is insanely tight and the head-bobbing is adding even more to the motion sickness I'm experiencing, this is something that rarely ever happens to me.I shot an AI controlled team mate, it instantly failed the tutorial mission. Why even let me shoot my own team if it's a failstate? The on-screen text is insanely small on a 1920x1080 television, I can hardly read which keys it wants me to press. The dialogue can be difficult to hear and what I can is quite dry and boring. AI vehicles do nothing to prevent colliding with my player. As far as I can tell my player can't jump, nor can he scale waist-high walls. This is something that's very difficult to accept after playing games like Battlefield.I'm only in the early stages of the game but so far I have spent more time riding in the convoy than I have engaging the enemy. When I do get a chance at some action I'm finding that my shots are being blocked by invisible geometry. Great.Red River is just so disorienting and boring, combined with the clipping issues, I just can't continue playing this tragedy of a game.			"

												I bought this in a bundle together with the first OP Flashpoint game, and I must say the devs took a step in the wrong direction with this one. I bought the games because I like realistic shooters, and with this they made it more COD like. Movement feels sluggish and akward, and it feels like a slight delay between the klick and the shot. But worst of all, ranges as decreased to point blank. Flashpoint went from engagements at long range, where you recieve accurate hostile fire, where you have to effectively use cover, and provide accurate counter fire, to high phased running through small areas wehere getting kills are more reliant on speed and quick reaction. You rarely get to see hostiles at ranges above 100 meters, and the enemies wont shoot at ranges over this either, not that it matters anyway, you're safe, they can't hit a barn door. It does however allow you more choices with your own gear, and choose what class/role you want in your squad. And it does ofc have improved graphics and stuff. Butt all in all it dosen't live up to the previous game.			"

												Good game back when it came out. Great AI, good graphics, user friendly controls, makes ARMA look crap.Multiplayer no longer works because it relies on Games for Windows Live. GFWL is no longer supported at all. There is no patch being made to fix this either as the developer no longer exists.			"

												If you want a terrible, sub-par shooter with awful dialogue, and completely lacking in entertainment, buy Operation Flashpoint: Red River, and see how the developers destroyed a franchise. Seriously Codemasters, what were you thinking? I suppose it was good they closed the studio that made these games. Red River stumbles around in the dark, trying to decide whether it's an  ultra-patriotic, unrealistic shooter (when Flashpoint was once one of the most realistic out there), or a practice in coding AI that actively seek to ruin and/or destroy your ability to function in the game world. Do not buy this if you value your money.			"

												Good frame rates , I got over 100 FPS on average , minimum is 80 FPS.Voiceover is good for most of the time.Lot of cutscene and voiceover , easy to learn and play with.You can pick up weapons from enemies (RPG, AK74M , even Chinese 95 AR), so you can play beyond the limitation of your class (rifleman , grenadier , scout , autogunner).But you need game for windows live account to save the game .As you know GFWL support service has been shut down , so you cant register new account . That web page is no longer exist.I have GFWL account years back , so I have no problem at all . Run good on WIndows 10.  Sad to say codemaster shut down the flashpoint studios, so no more operation flashpoint game .GFWL may be a problem for you , so I cant recommend for this reason.But if you have GFWL account , you can still play and enjoy , you can save the game , GFWL  can run in Windows 10  but you cannot register new account so you cannot save game if you have not registered before GFWL shut down.

												Operation Flashpoint Red River is a nice mix between action an realism. You may only take a couple of bullets before you die and the enemy is quite triggerhappy and accurate - so tactical movement is mandatory.As a Squadmember you accomplish various missions in an afghanistan-like country. You fight refuges as well as trained soldiers. Do not expect too much tactical depth. Altough the maps are open, the path you take is mostly given, support options are more or less scripted and your AI-Teammates are not very clever. In fact, I spent a lot of time healing and reviving them (however: you don't have to... they will respawn).Quality and ""fairness"" of the mission varies a lot. Some will be interesting and fun, others will just be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ But in the end it is still worth playing. There is also a challange mode which will give you some small, but mostly open missions. There is a leveling system which unlocks weapons and gadgets for your marine (with 4 choosable classes).Important Note:Games for Windows live is dead. But you still can save your game by creating a local profile.			"

												This game is such a good game, but it has a lot more potential. The graphics and what not are rather nice and the game feels smooth in my opinion, but the story is way too short.The story line or campaign if you want to call it that is great, but it's too short. I completed it in a number of hours which isn't what I like in a game. I'd love to see a longer campaign added or something.The game itself is good and worth it's money; you can control your AI squad which is brilliant. Another game like this one would be a must buy, so I hope one eventually comes out.9/10 from me.			"

												OpFlash Red River is an odd class of shooter that's both based on a realistic subject, and is quite realistic. It is not superbly realistic like the Arma Series, and it has little RPG elements where you fight to gain XP to level up, and use that to improve your various combat skills like sprint, weapon changing, accuracy, scouting, and so on. However, it is a welcome change from the usual ""blistering pace shoot everything"" type shooter (such as Call of Duty Modern Warfare series, or the Medal of Honor series). You control Fireteam Bravo, one of the four marines in Tajikistan, where the US had gone in to take out the guerilla forces aiding the Taliban and Al Qaeda. You will have plenty of friendlies in the campaign missions (fireteams Alpha and Charlie) and various support elements (if any). You can play as one of four classes, rifleman, scout/sniper, grenadier, and autogunner/LMG, each with their ""skills"" and ""weapons"" and accessories to unlock. There are 10 main campaign missions, and they are quite long, with a lot of sub-objectives and waypoints. When you are done with those, there are ""fireteam engagements"" (your fireteam against everybody else) you can play. Generally AI handles the other 3 team members, but if you want multiplayer other players can take over those 3 slots. Graphics are quite good, and campaign missions are quite good, if a bit on the difficult side, as even on easy you WILL get killed A LOT and not knowing where you did wrong. All in all, if you crave a ""realistic"" shooter and can't stand Modern Warfare you may want to give this one a try.			"

												I definitiely recommend this game. You WILL have to get through GFWL, however. It was a real pain to set up for the first time, mainly becuase I had forgotten my password to my account. It takes a few minutes to get past the humps, but once you are in, there are no issues whatsoever. To preface, you may have a sound issue. I am running on Win 8 using a Toshiba Satellite L-55B. Going into my sound settings in the control panel and disabling the microphone solved the sound issue for me. After almost 40 hours into the game, 1/3 through my third playthrough, I can say there is a slight learning curve. It is unlike some FPS games where you can basically rush in. It is all about tactics, or you will make it harder for yourself. You must utilize fireteam orders, even better if you can manage ordering specific fireteam members during engagements. Especially when you get about halfway through. For those that haven't picked this game up yet and haven't researched it yet, I will leave out spoilers.Biggest con about the game, and I personally wouldn't consider it a deal breaker, is that the AI classes do not gain experience during the campaign. Your very first playthrough is going to be rough, becuase you have not gained access to any good equipement or B-Mods. To sum it up, the only way to gain expereince with a class is to play as that class in the campaign. I did my first playthrough with the default starting class, the Rifleman. My second playthrough was with the Scout (sniper), and I can say I'd recommend doing your first playthrough as the Scout. You will definitely learn how to compesnate for bullet drop much quicker, your main weapon deals max damage (very handy when it comes time to deal with armored enemies), and is semi-automatic for quick, instant death shots regardless of placement. Again, that will come in handy later on in the game, becuase it will get very hairy every mission. The Autorifleman is also a good one to start with (my third and current playthrough) because your weapon will hold 200 rounds, which helps with supression and large groups, without going dry quickly. That will allow you to get through just about any engagement without having to reload constantly. That is really the only con. The repetitive dialogue is getting a little old, but it doesn't bother me. Now for the PROS!This game has very good replay value. Even after my third playthrough I still get excited when accomplishing the mission goals, and it is rewarding. Especially hearing that sound when leveling up. The is why I don't consider my above con to be a deal breaker, because playing through from the start as a different class allows you to gain experience for that class, allowing any AI playing as the class you had used from the previous playthrough to utlilize the unlocked gear and B-Mods which makes it worth it, as your fireteam will be kicking some serious butt with the increased accuracy and damage endurance. Since my Rifleman and Scout are max level, more often than not they will pick off kills before I even have a chance, whereas compared to my first playthrough I was basically doing all the work. I could keep going, but I'm heading back to the game now. It's worth the $9.99 and effort to get through first time setup with GFWL. And don't worry, your game will save.Good hunting!			"

The Hyper lethal nature of the game is also a nice touch for those who enjoy games such as ARMA and America's Army, but do not expect a tactical game beyond positioning and squad tactics, which are implemented very poorly6/10 if you like FPS/Hyper Lethal games.

												GLAD IT WAS ONLY $3 BUCKS... it had a lot of great ideas, but it was poorly executed in my opinion! I'd say it's like Call of Duty action, crossed with the squad strategy & movement of Brothers in Arms, but its rather over-complicated compared to Brothers in Arms... Enemy AI tend to just run out in the open... The shooting is smooth... a little too smooth like the firearm was lubricated by dipping the whole thing in a barrell of oil, even the sounds of the rifle sounds like it has supressor on it... The graphics aren't too shabby, better than some games I've seen lately... the sound is pretty basic, kind of gives you a headache... The attitude of the fellow American soldiers was rather irritating, typical gun-ho 'murica if you ask me... and that annoying black guy that sits on his♥♥♥♥♥and does nothing and constantly drills you with insults.... Seriously... there should be an option to disable him. Overall... it's not a terrible game, but I'd say it's especially for people who prefer the older 2000-2005 arcade style shooters... Pick this game up on special for around the $4 or cheaper mark...			"

												Well....It's kinda hard to start, because I really tried to hate this game, but I really like the series, so it was an ambivalent decision. The graphics sucked back in 2011 and suck now too, but the effects are sometimes quite good and help to enjoy what's wrong. Lip sync is horrible and the AI can also give you a headache. So why did I like it? Because it had a very catching atmosphere. I really felt I was in a real war against real soldiers. The script feels a little simple, but it is enough for a game like this. The game has its ups and downs but I really recomend it for fans of the tactical shooter genre.			"

												It's difficult to see whom to recommend this game. If you are into hard-code millitary simulations, you're better off with ARMA. If you are into fast action like Call of Duty, then get Call of Duty. This is somewhere in between. If you don't expect either extremes, you can get a few hours of entertainment with it, especially if you play coop with friends. Single player can get frustrating due to the absolutely dense AI.All in all, not a hit, but not as bad as many people make it sound like. And SSgt Knox isn't that bad either :)			"

												Can only say i enjoy it alot with friends online. Coop is good fun if you have some nice friends on teamspeak as well. Gfx is alot better in this version compared to the old dragon rising.Sfx fits the game. Cant really complain here either.Gameplay feels more fluid but still accurate. Bullet falls over distance so plan your moves. You cant just go shooting and blazing like call of duty.Game runs windows live for all online activity so you can get achivements for xbox live.Important!Windows Live is not shutting down there online support. Iam saying this because i have seen reviews posted that it should, but its false... Just google it and you will find it posted by gamespot and any other reliable source... So yes it works online fine... Iam writing this September/2014Recommend it? YES ofcourse ... Get some friends on it as well..			"

												what can i say about this game? ... HORRIBLE! ... waaay too much talking and cutscenes, and apparently its a RTS game disguised as a FPS game or combined with a FPS game in the worst possible way! ...  to hit something with a rifle over 50 meters is impossible...its programmed to be impossible.. .you need to bring your team around like a ball and chain and just use tactics and rts style gaming... now its ok that it relies on tactics... but when the aiming and firing becomes relative and just a visual effect more or less... oh lord...this game is worth - 100 dollars...  (minus) they cant rent space on my computer ...but still its not worth it.the really really dropped the ball on this game... Operation Flashpoint used to be good! this one really nailed the coffin shut.			"

												Soo, lets talk about OF:RR, I have 2 copies of this game ( Xbox and PC) and at first impact (2011) i said : ""Meh, wtf is this♥♥♥♥♥♥"" then i went to gamestop and i changed the game, after 5 month I wanted to finish it so i've bought back this game and i've completed it in 1 night... From that moment I started to love this game.In conclusion : You could say that the intent of Codemasters has been made ​​so well to reach a logical conclusion: the war is not so funny. Those seeking immediacy, spirit of competition, entertainment and pure fun have several other products to consider, Operation Flashpoint: Red River is dedicated exclusively to the fanatics of the war ( virtual or not), with a marked propensity commitment. It' a specialization that, of course, involves some weakness in the overall evaluation of the product as a video game, but lovers of ARMA or some Tom Clancy (which, however, prove far more structured from the point of view playful) the will certainly find an optimal solution, especially when played in multiplayer, definitely the most suitable condition to enjoy it.Pros :-Approach quite original in its realism.-World wide and freedom of movement.-Cooperative multiplayer optimally implemented.-Gameplay mixes realism with action well.-Lot of funny dialogue.Cons :-Bad A.I (Excluding Hardcore).-Dedicated only to those who love the rigorous simulative war games.-Technical realization not up to some competitors.-Average graphics.-Short.

												This game takes everything that Dragon Rising was, and improves it immensely.+Mission flow is highly improved. You fight and feel as part of a platoon in the campaign.+Campaign is actually very interesting and as a semi-sequel to Dragon Rising, really succeeds at sucking you into the story and the action. It is a MAJOR improvement off of Dragon Rising (Which I can't remember a god damn thing about.)+Good characters. There is at least one character you will never forget after playing this game, and several other interesting ones with their own distinct personalities that you'll hear plenty of throughout the campaign.+Combat is fluid and as realistic as this series has ever tried to get. This isn't as realistic as ArmA, and this isn't as Arcadey as battlefield, but that's because this doesn't try to be either. This is a good in-between point of those who can find no joy in either. +Fireteam Engagements allow for extra gameplay after the campaign+Player Progression system awards you for doing the best you can on all missions and for completing as many secondary objectives as you possibly can.+Class Setup module allows you to fully customize the loadout of your entire squad before going into a mission.+Compared to Dragon Rising, this game features HUGE maps with improved grapihcs that allow for long and intense missions. You really feel like you're fighting in one country rather than several ""maps"" as you fight along a road from one border to another.-Windows Live. Sigh.-Did I mention this uses Windows Live?-Lastly, the WORST part of this game? It uses Windows Live.Seriously though, this game is AMAZING and so very worth the full price. On sale? Even better! This is a game that many will pass up, but you definitely won't regret paying for once you get past that first Windows Live login screen. Definitely give it a shot if you enjoy semi-hardcore shooters.			"

												Operation Flashpoint: Red RiverPositives:+ A nice change of scenery from the previous installment in the series, Operation Flashpoint: Red River takes you to the war-torn areas of Tajikistan and beyond. You'll be fighting against terrorist hostiles in the desert, while also dealing with the People's Liberation Army of China.+ Story wise I would say the game is decent, but it doesn't feature anything out of the ordinary or ground-breaking. It's a pretty standard tale of U.S forces securing key objectives like dams and defending Fall Out Bases.+ As with the first title, Operation Flashpoint: Red River closely resembles a military simulator, so it's great for gamers who want to play tactically.+ Graphics are passable, not top notch in any respect, but reasonable.Negatives:- The guns just don't seem as fluid as the original game. I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is odd. The weapons just appear to be less exciting and more generic. The feeling you have when firing isn't the same as in Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising. I'm not complaining about the realism of the weapons, they just have no charm. In Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising, they were both very fun to use and realistic.- Squad commands are once again a pain to initiate. Really poorly thought-out system that simply doesn't work as intended in the middle of shooting at enemies. Too time consuming and difficult to do. I finished the game purely by solo killing, with my teammates behind me providing default covering fire.- The game can start out slow, most of the missions aren't too engaging in terms of gameplay. While the new desert atmosphere is nice, it can also be a bit bland at the same time.- Game is short at 20 hours, although this isn't the worst length for a First Person Shooter I've come across.- Voice acting is kinda strange to be honest..just a little.Overall Score: 6/10Operation Flashpoint: Red River isn't a bad game. It's just not as good as the Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising. It's shorter, the guns aren't as enjoyable, the environment is fresh and new, but it doesn't have the X factor that Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising retained. In the end, it's a game still worth purchasing, but definitely on sale.			"

												This game is bad.At the begining you are asked to sign in with Windows live, meaning that any achivements you get will be for windows live, not for steam.If you don't have games for windows live on your PC, the game just won't launch.Then you start the first campaign, the first cinematic is pretty good, it just has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ resolution for some reasons.After that, you are in the game, The first thing that hits you are the graphics, the game is really ugly, and the FOV is horrible, it's designed for console and so far I haven't found any way to change it.The second thing are the controls... GOD it's bad, there's this aweful mouse lag that stay even with VSync disbled. There are way too much orders that you can give to your teammates, it's just messy as f*ck.The game does not have any tutorial, you just go to a shooting range to test weapon but nothing else.I don't recommend you buy this game.

Constantly killing all the enemys and saving my AI buddies from bleeding out, even if I am unsucsesful they come back at the next checkpoint.There is one night mission and NVG's are not needed.If you have got this far and woundered why It has a negative recomendation then you do not understand sarcasum.Graphics are aweful, the original half life is better because it is consistent. You can't have a high polly soilder next to a one texture hill. May be fun if you have friends to play with but if you are alone don't bother because the AI is idiotic at best.

												Offensively bad semi interactive movie and with a terrible control scheme.The menu system is barely usable with a mouse. I think it wants you to use a controller:a) You have to press enter in the menus to accept things, rather than clicking accept or escape or something.b) To change your loadout in the menus you need to use the mousewheel (?!?!) rather than simply clicking on things. This also isn't stated, so it took a while to figure out.c) You have to use the keyboard to navigate, rather than the mouse.The game itself is also based entirely around a controller:a) If the mouse sensitivity is anything higher than 1/10 then moving the mouse causes the screen to do about 50 360s.b) Even on 0 or 1 the mouse has insane amounts of mouse acceleration, meaning I could hardly aim in the right directionc) The FOV is like 50 or something. Which, combined with the super-yawing mouse input, means you'll never be able to see anythingd) The game uses a radial menu for squad commands.... but rather than navigate it using the mouse, you need to use WASD!!!! It's really hurt my brain to try and use that input method to give commands.The game itself is also a barely interactive shooting gallery. Be prepared to spend 8 unskippable hours in a truck with an angry and degrading NCO, and a few moments in action commanding around your fireteam who can barely walk in the direction you tell them.It also uses GFWL, which was a pain as I couldn't log in for ages (I had to use a separate 'app password'. GFWL didn't tell me this).I tried to get a refund I found this game so bad, but I'd forgotten that I bought it yesterday in a humble bundle for $2. The game is so crap that I kind of want a refund on the entire bundle now as it's tainted..			"

												Operation Flashpoint : Red River,Is a game thatdoes carry the ""Operation Flashpoint"" in it's name and might invoke certain expectations among people. Normally, OPF games are known as combat simulators, but that's not what this game is.Is bad, just because of that? No, I mean Call of Duty, Medal of Honor, etc. are good games in their own way and so is Red River.Think of it as a infantry squad based light strategic action shooter and you get the idea.You and your squad are tasked with several different missions, more than enough to keep you entertained for a while.Emply some basic tactics and enjoy the action and funny staff sergeant.As long as you play it that way, you'll be fine and the price is also okay.Because, with that you get character progression among several classes (replay value), weapon unlocks, gadget unlocks, full campaign Co-Op mode, Fire Team Co-Op missions, nice graphics, good sound and fluid controls.So, yes, I do recommend this game, but only as longs as you're not comparing it to Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising or let's say the ArmA type of games. They're completely different.			"

												Pretty cool game. I especially enjoyed the Staff Seargent's rhetoric and story line/cut schenes aren't too bad. It plays to me just like a straight forward military fps. Just missions with some simple goals. Nothing fancy. The weapons are ok, and you don't get to select much to take with you for quite some time. The air support is pretty neat but hard to aim and get a good hit from.Fighting is pretty bland, and AI isn't all that smart. Most enemies will stand out in the open or stand up behind cover for a considerable length of time. Enough to take them down anyways. I didn't find any decently smart AI (Someone waiting in a building behind a corner for you or anything). Still, fun to play if you just want to shoot some decent guns. Don't be expecting anything too phenominal.			"

												In this game you're a marine who doesn't know how to be a marine. In this game you can't save your progress. In this game you can't do multiplayer. In this game you play with and against autistic AI. In this game most of your missions will not complete without all the marines in your unit inside transport humvees. In this game the autistic friendly AI will probably be stuck in some kind of house or compound and you will not complete the mission. In this game you will play 1 hour long missions to be held up. In this game you will rage quit to find out your♥♥♥♥♥♥has not been saved. In this game you will attempt to create a Windows Live account so you save your crap and play with and against real people, not the incredibly stupid AI, but you will fail. In this game you will decide to waste your cash on something else next time.This game is as good as it's AI.			"

												The ammount of open world there is makes it very realistic and a great game to explore at the same time as fighting insurgents. I have not seen this game being greatly popular but it is so much better than games like Call of Duty but then also carries an aspect of Battlefield making it one of the best FPS war games I have ever played.

												While not the best shooter ever, it's worth checking out if you want a lighter ""ARMA""-vibe of a shooter. The AI is VASTLY improved in not being aimbots that are able to see you from 50 miles away unlike Dragon Rising. However the game isn't a vast improvement. The squad ordering is still a little clunky and the missions themselves aren't as open as Dragon Risings were at times. Still, it's a much better game than Dragon Rising and for that reason alone I can recommend it to people wanting a tactical shooter.			"

It treads a nice line between the realism of ArmA (very little shots to kill enemies etc) and the fluidity/arcadey-ness of Call of Duty. 16 hours played so far, and with DLC incoming I'm sure more will be had.

												Laughably bad game. The mouse input is very ""floaty,"" there's a five-minute part at the beginning after you complete the firing range portion of basic training, where all you do is listen to your platoon leader ♥♥♥♥♥ and moan about how horrible your and your squad is while listening to some hard rock music that's playing in the background. Then you're inserted in a town where you're fighting enemies, ones, who are quite dumb. This is my favorite part: I found myself having to wait for my unresponsive squad to regroup into the Humvee, and there was no clear way to control them to get inside the vehicle. And so that ended my adventure with this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game. Very poor AI, and it's too bad, because I would have wanted to give this game a fair review.  Fortunately I spent only 2 dollars on this game, and it is worth nothing more than that.			"

												The controls are very poor, and were clearly designed with consoles in mind. For example, looking around in a vehicle using the mouse is difficult as the camera constantly tries to revert to its default position (which makes sense if using an analog stick, but not with a mouse). There is also a substantial amount of mouse acceleration, making aiming extremely awkward and difficult. Menus are clunky - console like - and are meant to be navigated using the arrow keys and enter instead of the mouse.Graphics-wise, the game is unimpressive, especially for a 2011 game. There is heavy pop-in of vegetation, low quality textures, and excessive amounts of blur.AI is dumb, especially your teammates which do practically nothing. They only come in handy when you get shot and need healing. The gameplay as actually quite linear, and not nearly as open-ended as it might seem. The large scale of enemy units in many cases can make for some entertaining shootouts, but by the end if actually felt much more like Call of Duty than a military simulator.			"

												As a Marine in real life, i must say that after playing this game all the way through, that it made me more motivated. Especially Ssgt. Knox. He's gotta be the most badass snco ever! I like the way he gives you ""words of encouragement"" before and during each mission. This game has some pretty accurate usmc lingo, like the mention of the infamous ""Green Weenie"". I got a laugh out of that. Gameplay wise, your team is not the smartest bunch, but they do help you get the job done. The enemy ai on the other hand is straight up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. They just come at you in hoardes to make up for this lack of intelligence. I ve seen some enemy squads just stand there while i aimed a well placed m203 round in the middle of their formation and just saw them evaporate into mist. The rifle ballistics id say are pretty spot on, as you get some bullet drop the farther out you try to shoot, and your rounds impact in a small cone of death as you try to engage the enemy. Afterall, these are government issued rifles the game replicates, not some high speed match grade rifle. So accuracy is good enough for government work. Also if you are a fan of bands like megadeath, drowning pool, and disturbed, then you are going to like this game as well. If you can get past the gameplay quirks and appreciate to small details in this game relating to the Marine Corps, then this is a good game. I would recommend this game to tactical shooter fans, Marines, and anyone else who like rock and or metal bands.			"

												I'd love to write a review based on the gameplay for this one but I can't. Once I'd dealt with the GFWL crap and got into the game, regardless of the settings or resolution I chose, after about 3 minutes of gameplay the game would slow to a crawl. THis is on Windows 8.1, with an i7 4770 and a 7970 so by no means is this the machine.Now I'm sure there's probably a solution to this but to honest I'm not even going to bother. It's not as if there aren't other FPS games that are ultimately going to be more satisfying and work out of the box.			"

												나름 괜찮은 FPS 게임이다. 중국을 대상으로 벌이는 전투는 신박했으며, 중국의 인해전술의 무서움을 제대로 느껴볼 수 있다. 무섭다기 보단 심히 피로해진다. 본디 아르마와 아버지는 같으나, 아르마가 이 작품의 뿌리에서 분리(퇴사)되어 만들어진 정신적인 후속작인 반면, 이 작품은 초기의 모습을 거의 버리고 '라이트'함을 계속 꾸준히 증가시킨 계통으로 보면 된다. 사뭇 진지한 밀리터리 물이고, 여타 다른 쉬운 FPS에 비해서 난이도가 좀 있는 편이지만 다른 빡센 작품들에 비하면 아주 쉬운편. (레드 오케스트라, 아르마를 해보라...어렵다) 게임 자첸 평이하게 만들었고, 그래픽도 준수하나.. 차량 이동 파트에서 너무 시간을 잡아먹기 때문에 전투를 하면서 전혀 긴장감을 느낄 수 없다. 브라보 분대에 소속된 주인공 중 한 명을 맡아서 하는데, 이 때 자신의 역할을 선택할 수 있다. 소총수, 스나이퍼, 공병 등의 역할을 선택하고 그 역할로 진행하면 해당 역할에 대한 레벨이 오르는데 이 때 퍽이나 무기 선택 폭이 다양해지는 방식이다. 달리기, 정확도 등의 스킬도 따로 키워 줄 수 있다. 혼자서 하게되면 AI 3개를 통솔하는 브라보 팀의 분대장이 되며, 코옵을 하게될 경우 1P가 분대장을 맡게된다. AI들이 생각보다 멍청해서 좀 고생이 심한데, 분대장(또는 플레이어)이 내리는 통솔 명령을 시기적절하게만 잘 써주면 치료도 해주러 오며, 공격, 대기 등 세밀한 명령이 가능하다. 근데 신경을 전혀 안쓰면 애들이 안 움직이거나 너무 멍청해져서 고생이 심해진다. 하다보면 애들이 이미 죽어있을 정도. 총 10개의 미션을 진행하는데 처음엔 플탐이 적어도 후반을 갈 수록 미션 하나 당 플탐이 많이 소요되는 것도 특징. 이유는 맵이 넓고(아름답다), 서브 미션이 생각보다 다양하기 때문이다. 전쟁이라기 보다는 특수 부대 임무를 띄는 느낌이 강한 편. 혼자서 하면 재미를 아주 못느낄 가능성이 농후하지만, 친구와 같이 한다면 '코옵'이라는 마법의 작용으로 생각보다 재밌어진다. GFWL 제거 예정에 없는 게임이지만, 2014년 7월 1일에 종료한다던 GFWL 서비스가 연장됨에 따라 가지고 있다면 지인들과 분대를 짜서 플레이해보는 것도 좋을 것이다.			"

												So Operation Flashpoint: Red River is a custom experience. Maybe custom in this case isn't so good. The plot is, in my opinion, static and generic. You are a United States Marine deployed in Tajikistan to combat the insurgency there. You first breath in the game has SSGT. Knox greeting you. By greeting you i mean talking large amounts of dung and insulting your intelligence and you AI brethren. He does not say anything useful for the tutorial on the FOB except foul bigotry that i just can't imagine any Marine treating his squad mates, especially in a combat scenario. The plot turns over and you end up in the back of a canvased humvee with Mr. knox... He has the floor for more foul speech that Codemasters might of expected to ""pump up"" us Americans. But it actually was not anything that i would recommend, Unless it's around five dollars. On the flip-side, This game at least attempted to pull the line away from the mindless run-and-gun antics that Call of Duty has established in the shooter market. For that i say Bravo!			"

												Bought this game 2-3 years back and played through the first mission before putting it away. Came back to it today to try again, except this time I only completed the firing range exercise before mothballing the game.The shooting feels extremely stiff and very unrealistic. For example, no scope sway when zoomed in, noticible delay in clicking the mouse button to fire the pistol and when the gun actually fires. The sensitivity slider doesn't seem to do hardly anything at the lower levels, so get ready for some epilepsy-inducing spinning. Funny thing, at this sensitivity, taking aim and moving the reticle is extremely slow and almost requires you to readjust the sensitivity much higher to be combat effective at all.Movement also feels very strange. You can only sprint straight ahead, no running at an angle.  Transitions between prone, crouching, and standing are very dramatic and cutscene ish. If you accidently hit the prone button while in a firefight, get ready for 4 seconds of transitions to stand up again.			"

												Great game. Play style is very nice and actually having to think about your moves is a fresh change from most other shooters. I feel that in some cases a bit of transport would have been a nice change as you spend 99% of your time on foot and it would have made for some interesting changes to the games play through. I played through as the sniper for the whole game...one down side was that some of the addons to the weapon are only unlockable at the very end missions meaning that if you wanted to use them you had to play through the campaign again.

												Best military strategy game iv ever played, and i have played it for 187 hrs, the ai are not the smartest but whit a little upgrading and proper commanding they actually become pretty deacent later in the game. The upgrading system of the weapond its whats makes it fun and to se how the ai actually improve, but the most fun is when you play whit some friends or 4 to be exact!			"

												just no...this piece of crap game is filled with 'murica's army propaganda and empty endless tasteless marine's talks in the worst style possible.Just played two campaign mission and I feel the urge to puke. also because the Staff Seargent wouldn't stfu while on the humvee. Wish I could shoot him right between the eyes. Well, I did shoot two marines and for some reason the game went game over on the mission. After that I could resume from the very beginning of the second mission. Eh yeah.. i said resume....from the begining.Anyway..let's move onThe controls are a joke-port form console. On the default settings you can ""move and give order"" at the same time, beause the ""tactical"" menu keys are the same that you use to move ..""WASD"". There are no icons in the menu.. all textual, convulsed, confusing and... just NO. A simple 1,2,3,4,5,6... menu would have made this game almost playable.The tactic is non-hexistant and it's boring (well I only 1 mission and a half, but i'm 101% sure it doesn't get any better).Lucky I had this for free.Stay away from this garbage.

												The game itself is very good. A great single player, great multi player and drop in drop out co op campaign (something that should be in more games if you ask me) The only 2 main problems I have with this game is, the AI on your team in single player.  You should  play this game's story with friends only, the AI is some of the worst I've seen, even as bad as Aliens: CM. Also the graphics are pretty sub par. I understand that graphics don't make a game story does, but it dosen't help that the images on the stores page are much better than the actual game. My pc is a beast as well, completley out running the recommended graphics for this game. so its not a spec issue, a game issue. Other than that, its a good change of pace from run of the mill call of duty repeats. I give it a 7.5/10			"

												I heard Symphony of Destruction and Cowboys from Hell. 10/10.In all seriousness though, the game plays better than Dragon Rising without sacrificing the scale. It feels more direct and to the point than Arma, but with plenty of freedom nonetheless.The fact that dialogue changes to reflect your performance in the field is a nice touch and makes your decisions feel important, even if they might not change the outcome in the end.Overall, fun game. I enjoy it.			"

												Awesome blend of realism and action.  If you're looking for a game that combines the action of the faster paced FPS games and the realism and physics of the simulation games then this is the one for you.  The controls while using a controller are awesome and allow for great control over your squad.  And while I'm on it; the squad is as good as the squad leader here.  They do a good job of reacting to your commands.  Terrific game that I highly recommend.  Can't wait for GFWL to die and Steam to control the saves for this title!			"

												I have not even played the game yet, I started it up got an error message 6 times in a row till it decided it was time to load. Then after I hit return to start the game some♥♥♥♥♥♥about windows live. I've never even heard of it, I bought it through steam to use steam even if it doesn't save the files at least save it to the damn computer, I don't have a bookshelf full of portable data storage devices for nothing.This is my first thumbs down for not even being allowed to start playing the game yet.Edit: Finally got through and have been playing for a couple weeks game isn't too bad, besides if you get shot it's like you are about to fall over, oh and for those how argue that's realistic let me explain this.In the United States Military you are trained to keep going after being shot, yes you may slightly move or lose your balance but even so you don't just lie there or stand there, almost fall over and do nothing, and most importantly you don't leave a man behind. (Summarized quote form a Corporal United States Army and a Private United States Marine Corps.)The voice acting is ok, and I’ve seen people complain about the commanding officer always insulting you (since when is the military like COD were everyone loves you but nobody knows you.) I like the dumbed down AI with the being shot factor plus half the AI has a seizure or humps the wall and can't move it's better than dying quickly.The problem I think with this game is that they focused so hard on making it for console when allot more people would prefer to play it on PC with or without a controller. That and you would have allot less of Humvee's falling out of the sky and almost squashing you.I give this game a 4/10 more 48% positive rating, they did improve on some parts like weapon handling and weapon swapping, but they got lazy on allot of other aspects.Edit 2/16/2016Well now that I’ve played it for some time, made random gamer friends with windows live (Which I doubt will live much longer) I have to give this game a re-review.It took me a bit to start playing, after a while of playing i got shot and some weird but cool um well cool-ish digital distortion thing (IMMA ROBOT!) it's a part of the games thing so you’ve got appreciate it's consistency unlike some more popular shooters ""hint “hint"" Call of Duty ""hint “hint"". Anyway it’s a cool game I saw some reviews of how some of you complain about it not being a real tactical shooter or being nothing compared to ARMA. Let me fix the confusion ARMA is a hardcore realism Tactical Shooter, Operation Flashpoint is more of a softcore Tactical Shooter perfect for beginners like I was. This game even OFDR cannot be compared to ARMA they may have a similar aspects but they are different which makes them special, I was so mad at this game because of windows live and such little♥♥♥♥♥♥like allot of you may have been that I didn't appreciate the whole picture. The characters or the Outlaw Platoon appears to be from the south and the way they act well, they're different than us northerners and I'm related to 64 Southerners that I know of. So that part is different, the character models eh different but its Afghanistan and you stick out like a sore thumb no matter what so I guess you can be yourself to a point. The PLA thing that's just a part of Operation Flashpoint which is cool, it's different that always fighting ""those damn commies"" (notice USSR died years ago they're fighting the battle of economics more so than any war. Well I’ll be damned I sidetracked, going back on subject.With the class customization it's not as hardcore as OFDR which is better because there needed to be a softcore shooter that could introduce players into tactical games, I like what they did, thou I would have preferred more assault rifles, more scopes, and other attachments. The skills I kind of like only if they’d change a couple of them to be more realistic.Anyway I have to give this game a 7/10 It took me time to be able to play it explore it and then fully appreciate it, I apologize for the negative and long♥♥♥♥♥impulsive review.

												Its actually worse than Dragon Rising.They went from an Arma/Mil Sim casualised but not highly polished to a arcade style shooter akin to COD thats even less polished and bordering on having the shine of dog♥♥♥♥♥♥on a sunny morning. It dousn't feel good, it dousn't play good. The enemy AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and its just not COD. COD does COD good, this does not do COD somewhat well. I actually feel like playing Ghosts, WAW, MW1, or any of those instead of playing this.The story dousn't make much sense, its just a jumble of words and happenings but the really cool thing is the videos that show the events leading up to the game. This was cool in DR aswell. Hire that guy who did that for more stuff cause thats cool in my book but take the writers to serbia and remove them. Probably take most the programming team with them. And the publishers.The point being its basically another modern and so real FPS games instead of trying something really interesting and new but atleast it works more than that WW2 game on the Arma 2 engine. By works I'm not even sure how to explain that, but I in what I played atleast the missions didn't just break or glitch to be uncompletable. You just wouldn't want to complete them because they suck.TL:DRGame sucks, just buy a real Call of Duty.			"

												Not much to say about this one really. It's a mediocre co-op squad-based shooter with GFWL in it that has Taji insurgents. And chinese. And that's about it. Expect your usual fist-pumping 'MURICA dialog with this one, especially with your staff sgt., who will NEVER shut up about his 10 rules, which are basic common sense, and whose voice i recognize from Sazh in FF XIII. The fact that dude was swearing... like Sergeant Hartmann off Full Metal Jacket made me think the Taji insurgents ate his baby chocobo.It has a lot of squad commands but it's not like you'll need them anyway, the game can be beaten easily with you going lone wolf sniping everyone despite the game itself telling you that if you do that, you'll end up easily dead. Nope. Just go scout and grab the better sniper rifles around the higher levels, game's a breeze then.Don't waste your money, and play games that do what this game does but better.			"

												One of the worst shooters i have ever played. Controlling the unit seems really bulky, AI is badly programmed and the game has to long cutscenes with the worst game music ever. The levels are long and boring, and if you die you'll be send back a long way to the last checkpoint a long time ago. I would never recommend this game to anyone, and would advise everyone to stay clear of it.			"

												So eine grauenhaftes Stück Müll hab ich selten gesehen. Da dreht man es auf maximalste Grafik, 8x MSAA únd 16x AF und das Spiel sieht optisch noch beschissener aus als CS 1.6. Die Entwickler gingen offenbar davon aus dass es ausreicht eine Grafik wie Doom3 mit ner Menge Fäkalworte und typischen ""Soldat wenn sie nicht gehorchen reiß ich den♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bis zu den Ohren auf""-Sprüchen zu ""verfeinern"" um etwas mit der Bezeichnung Spiel zu erstellen, bei mir verursacht der Schwall an Matsch und katastrophaler Umsetzung aber eher an. Ich bereuhe den Kauf, sogar die Freizeit welche für den Download drauf ging, und am meißten ärgere ich mich dafür dem Spiel sogar noch ne Halbe Stunde meines Lebens ingame geschenkt zu haben.Zusammenfassung: Unspielbar, Mieserable Steuerung, ♥♥♥♥ Aiming, Kein 5.1 Sound zwecks Feindortung und die Texturen sehen aus wie verdautes Sandwich.Vielen Dank fürs lesen, noch mehr Dank fürs nicht kaufen!

												Worst game I have ever tried to play in my life. Attempted everything under the sun to get it to load up and nothing. Emailed Code'masters' and they were no help whatsoever. Still would not load so I gave up.Later, I got a new computer and hoped that would solve the issue. Nope. Still wouldn't load. Then out of nowhere it started to load! I hadn't even changed anything and it randomly started to load! But, as expected, it then crashed and would not load up again. Then once again, a random occurrence, it loaded again and didn't crash! After sorting out all the Games for Windows Live crap (which is completely unnecessary and a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥, it was working. But as you'd expect, not the way I wanted. I could only play the game in a tiny window. But I still wanted to check it out, so I played on.After numerous lengthy unskippable cutscenes, with a plethora of unnecessary curse words slipped in every sentence, I actually started shooting some bad guys! And guess what? It crashed not long after. I immediately uninstalled and am never touching it again. Do not waste your money on this, as it does not work. And this is not just a one off. Check the forums and online, you will see MANY more people with the same issues.			"

												if you want to try it,Play it with friends otherwise don't even think about it.I had to kill my squad because they didn't mount up to the vehicle. (bug)then the story continued. In the first mission you just wait the whole time riding that vehicle, no significant gameplay. (you just set there hearing them swearing each other and you do nothing else, boring first mission)clunky controls, I felt like playing online with high ping.may be 30 minutes is not enough to review a game, but that was a very bad start for me.I am not writing this just to fun, I want you who is thinking of buying this to think more about it.don't let many positive reviews fool you, see a walkthrough on youtube first.

												Codemasters started a new side studio called ""Codemasters Guildford"" to handle making these two Operation Flashpoint games, and they sucked so bad that Codemasters shut down the studio and went back to focusing on their racing games.Got this and a few other games at humblebundle for $1 to try out. This was such a bad experience that I am not even going to bother with the other game, Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising. Out of the hundreds of games I've played since becoming a PC gamer back in 1997, there are only a few games that I have ever quit playing and uninstalled within 30 minutes, and this is one of them.First, I can without even the slightest hesitation say that this game has some of the worst voice acting of all time. It is cringe-inducingly bad. It is so bad it made me physically ill and I pooped all over.This games problems start right away. It is immediately obvious how bad this game is when you start by doing nearly five minutes of riding with your squad in a humvee while a guy talks the ENTIRE time, enough to fill five pages of a book. He just very monotonely drones on and not one single word he says is of any importance whatsoever, just incredibly, mind jarringly annoying. After what feels like twenty minutes rather than five, you get out in a little area and get to kill two guys, then five more minutes of driving and him talking nonsense until your ears bleed. You get out in another small area & kill a few more guys, then five more minutes of driving and you get to assault a small town. In the middle of the assault is when I had enough and alt+f4 out and uninstalled. First off, that insane amount of riding in a humvee is unneeded. The guy rambling the entire time talking more than anything I've ever heard, even more than in a Mass Effect game, is uncalled for.Also, the gameplay is like something out of a paper cut-out book. My rifle barely moved when I fired it, the sound was bad, sounded like a kids toy gun, when your bullets hit an enemy it feels laughably uneventful and generic, the sight aim sensitivity blows, and the squad command menu is without a doubt completely unnecessary and is just a burden. The basic things you can tell your squad to do are things that are automatically done by the ai in any good game because they are basic actions that should be automatically programmed into the game for the AI, but here are left out to make you feel like you are giving them strategic commands, lol. It's like they said ""the game's AI isn't finished yet so we gave you commands to do it yourself"".Where Battlefield 3 would be a 8 or 9/10, this game is like a bottom of the barrel, stripped down, generic, awkward copy of BF3 and would at best be a 3/10. BF3 is a guy with a 20,000 dollar suit on and this game is a homeless guy laying in his own p1ss in the gutter begging for booze money. Codemasters' Dirt games, more specifically Dirt 3, is one of the most well made racing games I've ever played. I do not know what they were thinking trying to make this garbage horse crap of a war fps game, but they would have been better off not doing so. Especially since they took a hit on these games financially and shut down the side company they started in order to make them.To this game's credit, as god awful as it is, its engine is still astoundingly better than ARMA 2's, lol. But then again, Asteroids for Atari has a better game engine than ARMA 2 so that's not saying much.Anyone who actually likes and spends any time on these two Op Flash games is probably a recluse with no sense of human interaction and a horrible taste in games and should stop wasting time and kill themselves quickly.A diaper filled with sh-t/10			"

												If your looking for realism of warfare than this is the game for you. Overall I enjoyed it a lot. Unlike Modern warfare it give you objective, however you can do any sort of manuever you want. Unfortunately the campaign was really short and because there not a lot of people, the side campaign which could've been fun with co-op took a blow.Play with friends is recommended, however campaign is fun.I like to suggest there older version of operation flashpoint which I think was far better than the new ones, although the graphic isn't good, but the combat experience and the overall fun was way superior in my opinion. You get to control tanks, fly helicopters, etc. Even the story was really nice.			"

												If you played operation flashpoint dragon rising and hoping for more simulator gameplay in this game, DON'T expect it.Essentially they tried remaking an average generic fps with bullet drop and injury.Storyline is pretty boring after the first few missions, the AI run in a straight line right into your line of fire they don't even go prone, half of the ""gameplay"" is spent in the back of a truck which isn't skipable, you can patch your wounds which is cool but  you can also heal your broken legs etc making the medics useless.There was less real life put in and more run and gun wich isn't why I played the previous game.

												OFP: Red River is a very average shooter, and nothing more. When it comes to realism, it's somewhere between Call of Duty and ARMA with one-hit kills, large maps and bullet drops etc. If you excpect something like the first OFP games, you will be disappointed and I recommend trying ARMA II and ARMA III instead.The single player campaign is very dull and annoying, and this is mostly because of the dumbass AI. You basically have to fulfill the role of fireteam leader, combat medic, anti-tank and anti-air soldier and also the sniper. Your fireteam is only good for suppressing enemies and they occasionally succeed in busting a cap in the a*s of a random chinaman, but usually they just annoy the hell out of me by getting shot and not fixing me up when I get wounded. The enemy AI is as stupid as the one of your teammates, and most of the firefights feel like being at a shooting gallery popping seemingly endless amounts of infantry from a distance.The story is pretty basic ""hoorah murica get sum"" action with the U.S Marines saving the world, first from the evil imaginary taleban-Tajikistans, and then from the Chinese Army.The best moments of the game are when you have room to improvise and can use the vast landscape to flank the enemy, but unfortunately these moments are too few. Most missions are just shooting couple of enemies, sitting on the back of a HUMMVEE and repeating it all over again. The co-op feature pretty much saves the games, since if you have a couple of friends you don't have to deal with the dumbass AI all the time. There is also a leveling system with some customization available and you can unlock new gear and weapons for four different classes, which is nice and rewarding.If you enjoy FPS-games and want something more slower-paced than Call of Duty and Battlefield, try this one out. It was featured in one of the Humble Bundles a while back. It's still very buggy, although it has been out for years and it also forces you to use GFWL, which sucks.			"

												For context, I have Windows 8 Pro 64-Bit.The problem is that this game is heavily dependent on GFWL which is riddled with compatibility issues. I have tried all practical - and some unorthodox - methods of trying to get to the game to work but to no avail. For $14.99, not really worth the gamble. Maybe for $4.99, but probably not at full price. If you do venture into this most unpredictable realm you should expect serious issues from the get-go. I am not saying that it definitely will not run on your Windows 8 computer but be prepared for stress. There is a decent chance the game will not run at all. "

												Poor attempt at riding on the fame of the original Operation Flashpoint. Codemasters may have kept the name, but it's 100% clear that without Bohemia Interactive, they can't bring it back to its former glory. Didn't play it very long because after a few minutes, I already noticed that the game wasn't all that different from its predecessor OPFP:DR.If you're looking for a worthy sucessor to the original OPFP, go play ArmA. If you're just looking for a fast-paced arcade FPS, go play Battlefield.			"

												Well, this game is not as open-world free-to develop your own tactics as ""Rising Dragon"", but it got another advantage: Coop. Personally, I liked more ""Rising Dragon"", but ""Red River"", even though it has a microsoft market connection and the story is waaay to lineal and waaay too MURICA, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ YEAH, it's not bad. And you will enjoy it greatly if you have a friend to coop with. So, it's not a bad game, only it's more enjoyable to play with a team of actual human beings, instead of solo campaign.6/10. Didn't liked the story and the dinamics that much, but the coop is good.			"

												Don't be turned away by the ""Mixed"" stigma and that scary, danger-orange coloring to the same type-written word. This game has real meat to it, real substance that gives the game lasting value.  I've owned this game and played it off and on since its release in 2011: Operation Flashpoint Red River is worth your ten bucks ten times over.Red River is about as realistic as you choose, and your ""Normal"" difficulty rating still hammers home that this is a tactical, infantry-based military sim. Some corners are glossed over in a comesmetic way (e.g. Fireteam members completely restored at save checkpoints in the single-player campaign) which some find unappealing and what I'll bet you is the number one focus of complaints.The multiplayer options of the game are quite awesome if you pause to think about truly seamless the integration of co-op into Fireteam Missions and even the Campaign. Player Progress and Class Setup (rewards for Achievements etc.) are just whipped cream on a trifecta wedding cake.			"

												If you played operation flashpoint dragon rising and hoping for more simulator gameplay in this game, DON'T expect it.Essentially they tried remaking an average generic fps with bullet drop and injury.Storyline is pretty boring after the first few missions, the AI run in a straight line right into your line of fire they don't even go prone, half of the ""gameplay"" is spent in the back of a truck which isn't skipable, you can patch your wounds which is cool but  you can also heal your broken legs etc making the medics useless.There was less real life put in and more run and gun wich isn't why I played the previous game.

												If your looking for realism of warfare than this is the game for you. Overall I enjoyed it a lot. Unlike Modern warfare it give you objective, however you can do any sort of manuever you want. Unfortunately the campaign was really short and because there not a lot of people, the side campaign which could've been fun with co-op took a blow.Play with friends is recommended, however campaign is fun.I like to suggest there older version of operation flashpoint which I think was far better than the new ones, although the graphic isn't good, but the combat experience and the overall fun was way superior in my opinion. You get to control tanks, fly helicopters, etc. Even the story was really nice.			"

												Great game!....A lot better than Arma if you compare with the dates it was launch and the same date Arma was at the time. Even Arma3 does get that feel of game play. Too bad the OPFLASH Red River & Dragon rising did not take, the Arma fanclub did work on the counter intel, to sapp their base.Now for the price it is a hell of a game, and the game play reminded me the military training I received a while ago.

												It's difficult thing to rate this game. It's similar and different from Dragon Rising in some ways. We all know ""how big success"" was the OFP sequel at the moment of release. If we're rated it as next Operation Flashpoint it was bad game. If we treated it as another military shooter it was quite nice FPS with some fresh solutions.Mechanics is almost the same. I've got feeling that they've improved only balistics of rounds and gave us really nice ""Character development"" option.Missions are bit different from those from Dragon Rising. Everything looks more realistic. We're only small part of small operations. No more four-men diversions on the back of whole Chinese army. We're defending one of the village entrances, attacking enemy emplacements from the side or just protecting convoy at one of the grids.If you're bored by saving world against Russkies or Middle East Dictator it's game for you. Fresh and real (as real as game could be) view at war. Lot of waiting and walking and only a few shots for a long time. This is how it looks like.8/10			"

												OFP: Red River is a very average shooter, and nothing more. When it comes to realism, it's somewhere between Call of Duty and ARMA with one-hit kills, large maps and bullet drops etc. If you excpect something like the first OFP games, you will be disappointed and I recommend trying ARMA II and ARMA III instead.The single player campaign is very dull and annoying, and this is mostly because of the dumbass AI. You basically have to fulfill the role of fireteam leader, combat medic, anti-tank and anti-air soldier and also the sniper. Your fireteam is only good for suppressing enemies and they occasionally succeed in busting a cap in the a*s of a random chinaman, but usually they just annoy the hell out of me by getting shot and not fixing me up when I get wounded. The enemy AI is as stupid as the one of your teammates, and most of the firefights feel like being at a shooting gallery popping seemingly endless amounts of infantry from a distance.The story is pretty basic ""hoorah murica get sum"" action with the U.S Marines saving the world, first from the evil imaginary taleban-Tajikistans, and then from the Chinese Army.The best moments of the game are when you have room to improvise and can use the vast landscape to flank the enemy, but unfortunately these moments are too few. Most missions are just shooting couple of enemies, sitting on the back of a HUMMVEE and repeating it all over again. The co-op feature pretty much saves the games, since if you have a couple of friends you don't have to deal with the dumbass AI all the time. There is also a leveling system with some customization available and you can unlock new gear and weapons for four different classes, which is nice and rewarding.If you enjoy FPS-games and want something more slower-paced than Call of Duty and Battlefield, try this one out. It was featured in one of the Humble Bundles a while back. It's still very buggy, although it has been out for years and it also forces you to use GFWL, which sucks.			"

												Operation Flashpoint: Red River is something that fills the gap between realistic military sims and the more common mainstream shooters. I know the series is more known for it's more realistic approach, latest reference is 'Dragon Rising', franchise fans will turn it down because of that. It is somewhat dissapointing to see a series dummed down because the publisher demands to appeal to a broader audience.But this said, it does try to ease players into a more tactical and realistic approach to their missions. And I do applaud the fact that the developers tried to balance the two playstyles, because by doing so they might just pave the way for all those rushing reflex based players to grow up and become mature tactical players. Because we all have to agree on the fact that military sims have a rather steep learning curve that might scare new players away.The game is good looking and other than the sometimes superfluous banter the sounds are great aswell. There are even several funny anecdotes from other media. The only thing that is bothersome is the AI, and most importantly those of your squadmates. But if you micro-manage their commands they get the job done though. This being said it is obvious that the game would be tons more fun with coop buddies, and the developers facilitated this through the inclusion of various Fireteam Engagements.Allround if you're looking for a step-up from your average twitch-based shooter into a more tactical genre of games and you have some friends to play this with you it's totally worth it. You will learn to pace yourself, command your squad and look at situations from a tactical point of view before rushing into a insurgent populated village.			"

												Really fun game. A shame Codemaster won't continue the series.Bought it on a sale a while ago. All though the game is a couple of years old, it didn't feel that way.I did come across some annoyances when playing through the campaign, which could be worth poiting out. For ex:* Waypoints sometimes updates (moves forward with you) even if you find your own path towards your objective. Sometimes however, they don't, which forces you to run back and step right on them in order for them to update. This can be quite annoying if your in a stressed situation.* Ofthen when you have the team following you and stop in cover, for instance behind a building, when enemys are encountered, your team tries to find good firing positions themselves. Often this activity involves the AI team members to run out of cover, sometimes to the other side of the building - ending up on the enemy side of the building with no cover = canon fodder. So, instead of being able of focusing on the enemy - you are also focused on giving life support to your stupid AI team members.* There is an unresolved bug on mission 8. You are tasked to clear a small village of enemy troops, main objective being a tower in the village which you must reach and clear. However, even if you achieve the objective the game doesn't recognise it. Forcing you to load last checkpoint and do it all over again, and simply hope the bug does not appear again.The above negatives are directly gameplay affective. However I found one last annoyance which doesn't affect the gameplay, but rather the feel of the game. And that is the voice over for the intro of every mission, it sounded silly and didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the game.Despite of the list above. I still found this game to absolutely be worth the time I spent with it.It's real fun gaming, good challenges in the game. I like the feel of the game, even if it changed a little from the previous Operation Flashpoint.Overall a very good game and now that I've tried it I wish Codemaster would reconsider and produce more games like it. If you like military shooters I think you should try it out.			"

												Essentially a more casual version of Arma with a very well made campaign that unfortunately was overlooked by most.I played this game back on my xbox 360 when it came out and I loved it then and I still love it now.This is a well made tactical squad based military sim. It is a shame this is the second and last game in the series as it has left a gap in the market.I can't think of any other military sim games with a decent cinematic and tense singleplayer campaign; Arma being more focused on providing a platform for mods and multiplayer more than anything else. Only negative would  be that it requires games for windows live, it works fine despite the market place being shut down but still it should not be neccessary. Just another username and password required in a sea of digitally distributed games.			"

But one of its strongest points is the mission in which you get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you by the Chinese army. In most shooters you win. But in this mission the objective was not to win, but to delay the obviously stronger enemy army.

												Again, I will assume that this game didn't have predecessor named OFP CWC and that I only know OFP DR.So in comparison to OFP DR, I like this... they removed all the stuff that didn't work, was broken, unused, redundant and made it pure first person shooter.They also improved things like weapon handling and user controls, added player progression and what more, you can choose whatever loadout you want at the start of mission.From campaign itself i have mixed feelings, but overall it's not that bad... Then there are challenges - they can be fun for some time (endless killing of endless waves of enemies) and I can imagine I would spend more time in this game if I had friend to play with.But at the end, it's much better than OFP DR, still not that good as it could be, but the main reason why I do not recommend this game is.... WINDOWS LIVE.... that damn thing will bother you all the time and if you dont want to play only solo, you need it... how could someone invent something as bad as windows live interface?			"

												Bite Size ReviewThe Good:+ Authentic Iraq Shooter Exerpience+ 1 - 2 shots and enemies go down+ Weapons Feel Powerful+ First Person Story Telling+ Squad Command+ Realistic Objectives (Not Explosions everywhere - just clearing houses etc.)The Bad:- Games for Windows Live is Dead (Can't save, can't play online)- 1 - 2 shots and you go down- No leaning option that I could find- Squad Command is requires holding down capslock?- Graphics and level design show their age here The Verdict:This is an older game when it comes to the first person shooter genre. All things considered though I wouldn't mind this game and may actually enjoy it since it does have some good qualities. However the fact that it requires the now dead platform Games for Windows Live means it features are extremely limited now and kind of broken. If you are at all interested in this type of game - realistic damage and maps to shoot in - go buy Arma 3. It's seems better in ever way.			"

I noticed that the mouse sensitivity was way too high, turning it down to zero did not help. On top of that there is built-in mouse acceleration that, guess what, can't be disabled. Then it appears that the game is apparently not compatible with my Logitech G35 headset, so all I heard was dead silence. I carried on with my mission and got to about right after the tutorial when the game crashed. And thats the story of my last time playing Operation Flashpoint: Red River.			"

												This game has really good features, but one BIG MINUS!+ realistic show of Marines way of fighting+ humoristic+ graphics are fine for 2011+ tactics- HUUGE MINUS: This game has total problems with multiplayer - you can host an online game at noon without problem, then after 4h, your friend won't be able to connect at all without any reason- You cannot skip cutscenes - they are funny for the first time, but listening to them for the 3rd and so on is annoying.Playing solo is boring, but if you can play with your friends, this game is great. Still: due to the multiplayer problems you shouldn't buy it. Find other game if you still can...			"

												Again, I will assume that this game didn't have predecessor named OFP CWC and that I only know OFP DR.So in comparison to OFP DR, I like this... they removed all the stuff that didn't work, was broken, unused, redundant and made it pure first person shooter.They also improved things like weapon handling and user controls, added player progression and what more, you can choose whatever loadout you want at the start of mission.From campaign itself i have mixed feelings, but overall it's not that bad... Then there are challenges - they can be fun for some time (endless killing of endless waves of enemies) and I can imagine I would spend more time in this game if I had friend to play with.But at the end, it's much better than OFP DR, still not that good as it could be, but the main reason why I do not recommend this game is.... WINDOWS LIVE.... that damn thing will bother you all the time and if you dont want to play only solo, you need it... how could someone invent something as bad as windows live interface?			"

												In Dragon Rising you fought Chineese special forces,in this one you fight Afghany looking insurgents. The control setup is abit different from Dragon Rising,but i guess its editable (not sure,but i think so) It feels like you can do alot more team orders,air support/general support requests in this game,from the same menu/order button.In Dragon Rising you had Q for your team commands,and i think right Ctrl for airsupport etc.It seems Codemasters have made this more easy with all the commands available from the same menu/orders button.What i also notice is....your aiming,shooting skills are far more tested in this one then Dragon Rising,maybe it has to do with the different maps,and the fact that you start off with a marksman gun,for close combat in a village with many corners etc.Dont get my little amount of steam playtime wrong,i once had this on dvd-rom,but the disc got too scratched in the end,and it got unplayable. This and Dragon Raising was one of my first 2 games purchased on steam,back in 2015 i think. And i have been up till now refreshing most of my memories in Dragon Rising,and just recently been doing Red River again.If you have an active xbox live gold subscription,you will automaticly be able to play this in multiplayer with your friends,as windows live and xbox live are synced together/basically the same account from Microsoft. If you dont,i think i remember it being very cheap to buy an subscription for your windows live account for an entire year,half a year or even just a month at a time,to get the full experience from an old but very good classic like this one.The graphics on players,surroundings also seems to be abit better then in Dragon Rising. The soundtrack is very nice too,youll hear classic rock,rap songs while your team drives an humvee to the next location etc. Your ""fireteam leader"" can be abit too much at times,an Afro American who knows how to run his mouth nonstop,but i find it funny and quite realistic towards guys like that have to be. For a FPS game it feels really realistic with mortars,atillery,gunshots,screams etc coming while you all just in the humvee.You will have alot of cheap fun,if you love teamplay,coop,the more realistic FPS type of game,and cant afford the new mostly overprized games today. In 2017 i still enjoy this game to the fullest,and will probably team up with friends in this and Dragon Rising for a long time to come :) I only wish Codemasters would continue to work on this franchise,because they bring something different and very well made to the FPS genre.Again i have to say that i dont support people comparing Operation Flashpoint to BIs Arma franchise. They specialize themselfs on the combat and multi playable simulator,wich i do love too. But Codemasters made FPS games more tactical,team based and i love it too. :) Time to put aside that Codemasters and Bohemia Interactive once worked together on Operation Flashpoint - Cold War Assault. (Wonderful old game from back in the day) Both developer teams are great,ill just leave it at that. :) I highly recommend this game for anyone being interested in tactical,teambased,coop and more realistic FPS games. Old but gold,6 out of 6 on the dice ;)			"

												A ""serious"" game that's actually broken as ♥♥♥♥ but still funny as ♥♥♥♥ and good to play with friends and not take it seriously. And action shooter with some tactical elements such as squad commands and thats about all for the tactical side really. You must go up against a larger force and use your squad to over come the odds because they will be stacked against you every time. Or play with friends and laugh your♥♥♥♥♥off when the AI or the game's engine do something messed up, which is not game breaking but its still funny when it does happen.			"
