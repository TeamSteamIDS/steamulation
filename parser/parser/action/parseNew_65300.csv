												I should have written a review long ago.  After all, I've played this game for 1,000+ hours and idle'd in its level editor for a few hundred more.Dustforce DX is the deepest and most technically demanding 2D platformer ever made.  It has a momentum based engine where all actions have real weight and consequence, attacks have start-up frames, things are jump and dash-cancellable, and there are tricks measured in how many frames they save.  Every level has leaderboards both for score and for raw time, and the community is fiercly competitive and still very active.  More importantly, every run on the leaderboards also has a replay embedded.  Being able to watch your run (or anyone else's) is not just fun, it's a fantastic learning tool.  If that sounds like something you'd enjoy, then keep reading.Dustforce DX will never hold the player's hand.  Several people ragequit the third TUTORIAL, and a wide number of the advanced mechanics and workings of the game are never explained in-game.  To really master this game and understand everything in it, you need to know other people who play it and/or engage on the subreddit and IRC channel.  Even if you do that and arm yourself with knowledge: this game is HARD.  When you think you've finally gotten good and beaten the game, you have only just begun because you unlocked ""The Difficults"".  Honestly even getting that far is going to take you a hundred hours at least, because the only way to unlock new levels is to complete easier levels perfectly.  I'll explain...Dustforce DX has 4 main hub areas of one large world (The Nexus).  Each hub has 4 baby levels, 4 easy levels, 4 medium levels, and 4 exceedingly hard levels.  Each tier of level above the first is locked by a key, and you earn progress toward keys by playing the levels in the tier below.  But the only way to get a full key from 1 single level is to get an SS rank.  One S is completion: for cleaning all the dust and defeating all the enemies.  The other S is Finesse: for never losing your combo from dying, getting hit, or letting it time out.  The game doesn't just reward perfection, it demands it if you even want to see all the stock levels.Now why did I say stock levels you may ask?  That's because the true magic of this game is its INTENSELY POWERFUL level editor.  Custom Dustforce Maps (it calls them maps instead of levels) are what keep me playing.  This is one of several games where the editor gives you every tool the dev had, letting you make stuff on par with, and often exceeding, the quality of the stock game.  You have 20 layers to work with, tons of cool props, almost complete RGB color control and control over the %blend of the color PER LAYER, a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of props and emitters to place, several things with transparency for awesome effects, and total control over the music and sound effects at every point.  The last sentence is very important since this game has a truly amazing soundtrack.  Free control over the music in the editor doubles as a sound test, even if you don't enjoy making maps.  The nice thing about the leaderboards and replays is that you can watch everyone playing your map once you publish it.  That adds another level of enjoyment to the process, a feature missing from several other games with level editors.There are almost no restrictions on what you can place anywhere, allowing the free mixing of themes from the 4 hubs if you have the skill to make it work.  The game is easily moddable and the community has several killer spritemods available, one even turns a character into Kirby!  There are several different classes of mods both for art and for performance, and they are all easy enough to find on the subreddit.  Sadly they aren't integrated into Steam like with many other games.  The community also has several third party tools available for more detailed stat-tracking, new kinds of competition, and even a cool TAS community.In conclusion, Dustforce DX is a great game and one of my all time favorites.  It's not easy to get into: indeed you will struggle if you go it alone and it's still very difficult even with friends beside you.  You'll get what you put into it.  We still learn things about this game every week; the engine is just that deep.  A lot of the quirks in this game are things you just won't find anywhere else.  When I say that there's no 2D platformer with the complexity of Dustforce... I mean it.			"

												Awesome precision platformer.  Tight mechanics, deep move set, smooth flow, great music & visuals, clever level design, custom level editor, leaderboards, perfect for speedrunning.  It's safe and accessible for all ages, yet it's depth, difficulty, and mechanics make Dustforce worth buying over Super Meat Boy and other precision platforming ""greats"".  After 500+ hours this game is still fresh and fun, and I have barely touched the 2000+ user made levels.  With this kind of depth and replayability, Dustforce is easily worth the asking price!

												Dustforce takes platformers tested by time, such as Megaman and refines the genre to it's maximal potential. Everything is spot on, you are in full control, precise and absolutely magnificent. It takes a while to get used to the gravity, controls and all these essential elements in the game, but even after you got the hang of the basics, there are many more things to master. From combat to advanced techniques, there is always room for improvement. Dustforce was made for speedrunning, you can clearly see it with the leaderboard and replays of playthroughs of every player's best runs. You can see the best players what exactly they did at every level and learn the routes and have the wonderful experience of speedrunning, where you play the same level for half an hour to get that 0.07 second advantage.

												there’s a softness, an altogether pureness, in dustforce. it is a starkly wholesome game beyond its surface. the magnitude of how pure is even idealistic and immovable. it’s something that is hard to find in a video game that seeks new horizons. relations, though. the most amazing part about dustforce is the result of its softness. even if you lack the ability to play it - and nearly everyone does - it holds wide appeal. the art and music match the gameplay to a refined elegance. it’s a pacifist game and a performance game without being tailored to either, because it’s still clearly a platformer with all of the philosophy behind it. in motion, it’s wickedly cool and aesthetically moving. skill and display meet innocence and whimsy.dustforce is ludicrously difficult. it belongs to an elite faction of games I’d describe as harder than hard. the way it’s presented, that fact lays dormant. though loss is common in dustforce, there is no mean-spirit. nothing is out for your blood and none of the platforming is dishonest. what you need to do is nearly always set clearly ahead and it’s all up to your fingers. consequently, and not in a bad meaning, the stages end up feeling more like race tracks than levels. mind you, very stylized race tracks, or race track stages, but very laid-out and bare compared to genre tradition. this feel is accented, arguably engineered, by dustforce’s mode of progression. it doesn’t matter if you only get to the end of a stage in dustforce. you will, it’s always fun to clear a stage, it just won’t let you fully continue.dustforce’s inspiration and idiosyncrasy is speed running. platformers have always been a speed running favorite. converting art into performance and display, manifesting game and human potential. speed runs are incredible, but there’s an equally incredible entry barrier. the time expenditure needed to participate means that few will experience the overwhelming play. dustforce acts as a bridge. its ranking system enforces perfection. it does not simply weigh down your time a ranking. clear time is not relevant. to unlock levels, you need SS. to get SS, you need a perfect combo with full completion. dustforce’s ranking deals with links. dust you collect on the stage builds up links. hitting dust covered enemies continues links. they are lost when you are hit, go out of bounds, or have about a five second pause since your last link. there cannot be mistakes. speed runs contain no mistakes. though complete perfection is not required, dustforce is unforgiving to even the smallest mistake. finishing a long level from beginning to end, allowed only stylistic mistakes, puts dustforce above a precision platformer to a speed run simulator.dustforce isn’t the first platformer to demand perfection. I personally love contra for its sheer display and skill or die gameplay. dustforce’s pacifist aura and dedication to a track indeed separate it from any other perfection platformer, but what is most important is dustforce’s fluidity and sense of speed. though in plain movement it is slower than a mario game, a speed run never stops and dustforce doesn’t want you to stop. borrowing two key elements from other very fluid series - mega man X’s dash and modern sonic’s magnetlike fast-fall - and adding their own radical innovations with air dashing, wall runs, and jump refreshes, dustforce has constant varied movement. the combinations and radical changes in input keep you more than engaged, with the coolness of each character’s movement drilling in your performance. the rhythm, intensity, and constant movement translate to feeling unstoppable speed. dustforce’s core is an incredible renovation of tried mechanics with unbelievable vision in its additions. it has its idyllic goal of speed running and it refused accepted conditions. it contributes altogether on its own making both its direction and its core individual and fantastic.dustforce has a special presentation with a unique goal and altogether new gameplay, so I would be skeptic to ask: how are the levels? by my language, well, this is pretty easy to anticipate. dustforce’s levels are masterful. they allow for all kinds of different and often new naturalizations, realizations, and combinations of their gameplay. the tracks have clear and differing focuses, requiring techniques, hopefully building your repertoire while it remixes its challenges, playing on your expectations. there are huge clearings to cross, towers to climb, ceilings and floors to repel, narrow spiked corridors to squeeze through, enemies to chain your airtime, small platforms to caustically land on, expansive hills to slide through, beautiful spirals to loop around. dustforce isn’t just a very personal and unique idea, it’s a masterpiece of level design. I have qualms for the lack of linear pacing, there isn’t a way to know how difficult a level is going to be, but that’s a very small criticism, and the game still builds from easy stages to hard stages, it’s just done in blocks.plain to say, combat is not dustforce’s strong suit, and it feels relatively forced. so it is with an absolute lack of understanding that there are four small and constrained levels dedicated to fighting masses of around twenty enemies. to compensate for keyboard controls, for better and worse, dustforce ques moves. when platforming, it gives the game a sort of rhythmic and planned feel based on anticipation and expectation. in the heat of combat, it is awkward. you’ll find yourself locked into quick strikes and unable to dodge obvious enemy attacks, which is frustrating and unrewarding.another actually affecting flaw is how much singular input influences the character. slight adjustments are impossible. this again compensates for the difficulty to make smalls presses on a keyboard, however it removes from dustforce’s most important aspect: its fluidity. an obvious expression of this is a single block-wide hole with ground on either side of it. pressing right or left will walk over the hole and onto the terrain on the other side. there is no possible way to enter the hole from the ground, you must jump and make the adjustment. yet even if there is slightly more control in the air, it still involves much too large movements, and makes landing on small blocks or falling down in a specific direction imprecise and very much out of your own control, which is somewhat of a deathblow. the hideout is an infamous stage that brings this flaw to light but also serves as a great way to learn how to make the flaw work for you. the keyboard-tailored control is impossible to ignore, and while it is a noble effort, it sadly stains a perfect formula.dustforce is performance art. the fluidity feels like a dance. the speed feels like superimposed mastery. unlike a rhythm game, there is pure and awesome actualized design depth existing in-addition to the performance. unlike a perfection platformer, dustforce is rarely stressful, instead being meditative, being conductive, being pointed, being beautiful. it doesn’t demand perfection, it encourages it. as dustforce opens up, grows and evolves, so do you as the player. it shows that difficulty can be symbiotic to achieve fully wholesome results. dustforce isn’t do or die. it’s be or don’t be.

												Dustforce is a beautiful, traversal style 2D platformer with a lot of parkour, wall running, ceiling hanging with some light combat. If you're the sort of person that likes exploration and collecting in platformers, Dustforce is right up your dirty alley. First is its beautiful art style that makes it stand out from a heap of other platformers. Then you have a great sense of movement control. You can double jump, dash, run up walls for a brief time, wall jump, cling to a ceiling and move along to it before you ultimately fall off.  You can slide down slopes and Yaba-Daba-Do your way off inclines at the end to launch yourself.The game introduces you to all these incredible mechanics via three tutorial levels. One for traversing, another for combat and the third for advanced techniques such as dash jumping into a double jump to run up a wall. I had to return to the advanced techniques 2 hours into the game to complete it. You are never forced to do anything in the game, but there is definitely a need to perfect these skills.As a member of dust force, your goal is to clean the world of dirt by touching it. Its easy enough to just run across dirt, making it disappear, but the challenge becomes getting up walls, onto ceilings, and beating the dirt from enemies that gives harmless things a sinister new life. The object of each level is to dust trails of leaves, green glop and other forms of dirt all the way up to defeating a few enemies at the end. There's nothing to differentiate these enemies, one dead end full of enemies might not be the dead end full of enemies you're looking for.Combat gets relegated to two buttons, a weak attack and strong attack. The strong is only good for larger enemies, because defeating a smaller enemy will only scatter the dirt covering them and you'll still need to clean it. Light attacking enemies in the air gives you an extra jump, so you can double jump, hit an enemy and then jump a third time. As you play, you're also building a meter. When it gets full your character will color trail and pressing both attacks will give an automatic beating to enemies and dirt on screen. Assuming your character will be able to reach them.There are a few different types of enemies, big hopping heads, angry bears. There are more mundane hovering types either balls of leaves or gargoyles. Green balls of goo that will punch you back, hovering barrels dumping goo beneath them. Even a sort of porcupine that shoots quills or sharp leaves at you. The biggest threat is spikes that cover large areas in later parts of the game. Each spike death or pit in the Nexus or in a level will respawn you.When going through a level, you don't have to sweep every bit of dust or leaves, but at the end you're graded on your completion and finesse. For everything you clean, enemy or trail of dirt, you build a combo. Finesse gets determined by how high of a combo you score in each level. Getting hit or taking too long to clean something new will break your combo and hurt your finesse grade. Each level is also connected to a global leader board. Getting a ""S"" rank in a level will give you one of three colored keys (copper, silver and gold) to unlock new levels.The problem is you need to find every level in the game via a hub world called the Nexus. This hub world offers. a real sense of exploration and challenge even to get to these level doors. Some doors are clustered in easy to access areas, but others are for more skilled players. You'll need to slide down ramps and vault over pits, or double cling to ceilings to make it across a bed of spikes. There are even areas that you'll need to time jump, dash, jumps to make it through and then do it again. For every path you take in the Nexus, you'll need to make your way back. Its never as simple as doing the same thing a second time. You'll need to figure out a way to do it or take a different route and hope that it circles back. Other doors are completely hidden and you'll need to get into every nook and cranny to find secrets.Its not like Metroid where you unlock a new ability, getting there relies completely on your skill. After the first two dozen levels, everything gets a lot more difficult. Its this difficulty that some may love, but it hindered my enjoyment of the game. This Nexus is big and it has to be to fit over 70 levels in it.Each level starts by letting you select from one of four members of Dustforce. They're all color coated with different looks and ways to clean, but they all play the same. No one has any ability over one another. These characters definitely give the game character and charm. An old man wearing green carrying a vacuum, a brunette in purple with pom poms as dusters, a blue clad janitor with a humble broom and a female version with red overalls.In fact style summarizes the game as a whole, from the beautiful world with rich backgrounds in a washed out color pallet to the movement and flow of your character. Even the soundtrack has a style that fits the art. Its tranquil synthetic ballads fit perfect into the background of the beautiful cityscape, caves and laboratories.Outside of the Nexus is a different sort of hub. Its a place that lets you visit the tutorial levels, and even go through previous levels you've beaten. These tomes come in four different books, each for different themes of each level. There's the cityscape, the castle, laboratory and. I'd much prefer flipping through a book to find a level rather than exploring the Nexus, but whatever.For anyone creative, there's a level editor that lets you make levels in game as rich and beautiful as you'll find in Dustforce. You can even go online to download levels from your web browser. It seems like an extra step that should just be in the game. These levels all have ratings, difficulties and keywords tagged with them so you can find whatever you have a mind for.There's even local multiplayer survival and king of the hill for up to four local players. I didn't test this or anything so I can't review it until I get a party together on my wide screen to play Dustforce.Now for the bad stuff, by default there is no controller support, but you can rebind the keys to support your controller. The only problem with that is you still need to hit the ESC key to bring up a menu. Having a menu bind would have been nice, but its hardly a big issue. I've managed to get myself stuck outside of the screen and the camera just wouldn't follow me. Are these enough to ruin a game, no certainly not.While this is a beautiful game with a lot of fun mechanics, it just feels needlessly difficult to get to levels. Some may like the exploration to find a level or get to a door they see high up above, but it feels like extra padding. Even with all these mechanics the game still just didn't feel like fun. It felt like a chore to go into a level and touch every place with dirt, dust and leaves. Sure I didn't have to, but if I wanted a key I'd have to. In the later hours of my play through I spent more time just getting to the levels.			"

												Dustforce is a lovely game for those that enjoy speedy platformers with an emphasis on control over one's character.  The janitors in Dustforce can jump off walls, run up walls, run up ceilings, and perform multiple double jumps by defeating enemies.  Gameplay consists of mastering the route through a level to sweep up all the dust while continuing one's combo (which can be done by running over dust or hitting enemies) and avoiding spikes, pits, and enemy attacks.  The game employs a ranking system that judges based on completion (how much dust was ran over and how many enemies were defeated) and finesse (how few hits and restarts taken).  This game is perfect for those who go for perfect ranks in modern Sonic titles.However, later levels in the game approach unfair difficulty, spamming spikes and requiring jumps and dashes to be timed down to the millisecond to succeed.  Thankfully, it is not necessary to play any of these levels, and the game can be obtained at a price cheap enough to warrant playing only the well-designed levels in the first half of the game.			"

												This game is a matter of personal taste. Please listen to the people who are telling you it's all about speedrunning and replaying the same short levels over and over to get a better rank. The game is very simplistic and for me that was not a good thing. Simplistic as in not much to do. Unless you happen to enjoy the platforming style in the game and want to tediously perfect your ranking for each level.			"

""I can't beat it, therefore it's a bad game."" Just... No. This isn't Surgeon Simulator, or Probably Archery, or QWOP.Dustforce is underrated and unfairly downrated. Whether you're good/not good at it, the game is great. ""Tight and responsive controls"" commonly boil down to ""easy and requiring little brain power"" and lead to less technical capability for a player to utilize. It's one loathesome reason why people say gamers barely use their brains. Blaming the non-status quo movement and momentum physics to justify giving a negative review is a poor, lazy, subjective decision that doesn't do Dustforce justice, especially when many others can actually do it. Refer to Super Metroid for a minute. It's an iconic example of completely breaking the norm for platformers. It fused with action, exploration adventure, and has controls and physics that shatter your experiences if you've only jumped like a Mario or a Mega Man.Like a fighting game, Dustforce's controls will require some learning and does not give you ""Yeah, I get it"" filler moments. The skill ceiling is much higher. The tricks are much more complex. Good fighting game players know more than to just spam 2 moves. Good platformer players can do more than just run + (double/wall) jump. Also see TotalBiscuit's video review on his YouTube channel for a good, objective take at the game. It's for an old version but the things covered in the video still hold up. One more important thing to note is that this game was not made in Game Maker. Only the prototype was. The finished product uses its own workings built from scratch. Don't be like those fools who don't read/research and bash the game on an incorrect fact.Dustforce is a difficult game. That doesn't take all the fun away... There will be those incorrect people who think that being bad at a game alone means the game sucks. ""This game sucks"" is not the correct way to say ""I suck at this game"", or ""In reality, I'm too lazy to learn"". The controls, which can be rebound, do have a learning curve that the player is supposed to grow into and be accustomed with. This should not be a problem if you have played fighting games with a competitive/more technical mindset. If not, don't worry. Every player of this game was bad at some point. Just play through the 3 tutorial levels without worrying about getting S/S rank in the beginning. Granted, they're all harder than the first normal levels you will get so don't worry how badly you do, but they're there to show you how the game works of course. Trying to be immediately perfect at something new is an unrealistic and unhealthy mentality. Break things down into smaller pieces at a time. Their varied environments are good to experiment & practice in. You don't have to be the top 10%, or even top 30%, of the leaderboards to really enjoy what Dustforce has to offer.A while back, this game caught some flak with being compared to another fun, difficult game: Super Meat Boy. I have seen a couple speedruns for both games, including developer commentary during 1 of each run, I've seen ""Indie Game: The Movie"" with its developer coverage of SMB, and have had my hands on both SMB and DF. SMB is great for all its reasons, but it can't be compared to Dustforce since they're fundamentally different games. SMB draws much more on artistic theme. DF draws much more on technical gameplay. It's loud and clear that both games have different target audiences. If it isn't to you, then you gotta look and listen harder. These 2 are not better or worse when placed next to each other. Just different. Apples and oranges, ladies and gentlemen.SMB is more precision platformer than DF is. DF is more momentum platformer than precision. Here are a few points to think about this situation.SMB is a bit like:- Super Mario Bros. (Movement, as in there are fewer ""tools"" that the player will have and the environment accounts for most of your choices.)- Classic Mega Man (platforming)- A touch of Super Smash Bros style crossoversDF is a bit like:- Super Smash Bros. series (Movement, as in there are more ""tools"" for the player to use. Environment alone accounts for less than that of SMB. More on that in a bit.)- Zero's character style from Mega Man X series and classic 2D Sonic (platforming)- A touch of Super Smash Bros combat. It's simply ""hold a direction or not"" before hitting an attack button, but the timings must be right or you'll whiff and button mash like a newbie. The momentum style and Super Smash Bros aspect is even confirmed by one the developers. More info on that in the final paragraph.Dustforce has more weight on utilizing the system of the character at a deeper level akin to fighting games instead of just mainly interacting with the environments themselves. Players must be thinking about what they can do with their options and what the environment calls for at the same time. Much more of the game is in the player's hands instead of the environment forcing decisions in a 1-sided fashion. DF has more meat on character controls than your typical platformer: dashes, air-dashes, air-down-dashes, normal attack, normal attack + directional mid-air, heavy attack, heavy attack + directional mid-air, wall jump, wall running, ceiling running, slope sliding, momentum preservation after hitting enemies while mid-air, fillable gauge for super AoE attack, etc. All of these interact with the physics of the game to produce even more things. All of these are learned as you go and become natural. At least they should be. More attention on what your character is ACTUALLY doing (not what you THINK s/he should be doing) is a must in this game. Level selection also isn't just a grid with things to select. To play a level, you must clear the platforming section to the door in the hub world. This introduces the techniques required to complete such levels. Difficult levels will need the player to be skilled enough to reach them, let alone complete them.This game has been featured in Games Done Quick speedrun charity events. The Summer Games Done Quick 2015 run (Any% route) also has one of the developers talking with the runner and commentators. I highly recommend seeing that on YouTube if you're still skeptical on buying this game. The dev comments are great and the pro play will undoubtedly be amazing. There are also ""All levels S/S ranking"" runs to watch. Remember, you don't have to be as good as them to enjoy the game.Some dev comments from that run to note & more:- They thank the community greatly in helping detect cheated runs to delete off the leaderboards.- It's not so much a precision platformer as much as it is a momentum platformer. Get a feel for how far your momentum can carry you and keep going. If you can't make a jump, did you deliberately decelerate in mid-air or after landing on a platform? (You might wanna call up Sonic for some tips. And fire Mario or Mega Man if they happen to be your tutors who said that they'll teach you everything you need to know about platforming. You got scammed.)- The game is inspired in part by N+, and Super Smash Bros. series.- Coding for the movement and momentum consists of about 5,000 lines to be able to do what it can do. Some minor inconsistencies exist most likely due to rounding errors, but you wouldn't notice unless you were told about them or spent lots of time experimenting. None of these will bar you from completing the game at any skill level (obviously many have already done so) as all physics interactions discovered were tested.- Difficult levels requiring skill to reach and enter in the hub world is a system to help players recognize their strengths and weaknesses versus a traditional level selection screen where players would just get walled and discouraged by surprise difficulty spikes.

tl;dr -> In Dustforce DX you play as a master warrior-janitor on a never-ending quest to rid the world of all dirt and dirt-spreading creatures while listening to a fantastic electronic soundtrack.I got this game in a bundle, and was really excited to try it because of all the technical gameplay mechanics - like the complex executions you have to use in order to make your run look as seamless as possible. I had watched a few speedruns on YouTube and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of experience provided by Dustforce DX.If you like cleaning, artsy and smooth platforming gameplay, a stellar electronic soundtrack, chaining combos, score attacks, and challenging mechanics, then you will really enjoy this game.The aesthetics are great - the detail in the different levels is very high and well-done. The music and sound effects are awesome, and I will provide a link to the OST here because it is that good; I think the only other game OST I ever linked in my review was NEOTOKYO's.Dustforce DX OST. The controls are a bit tricky to learn, but the tutorials are very helpful and will ensure you get a firm grasp on the game's mechanics before you start your janitorial runs. You can try using a controller, but the keyboard bindings work just as well. The learning curve is minimal to moderate - one of the most difficult elements of the game is combining the different actions in order to achieve a smooth run. Combos are also essential for reaching many areas in each level and progressing deeper into the game. For example, you may have to wall run upward, double/wall jump several times, and hit a dustball/enemy at the top in order to reach a higher level (and if you do everything except hitting the object at the top, you will not be able to make the climb). Practising and repeating levels will really hone your skills.Overall, the gameplay is very quick and technical - chaining the proper actions is critical. Once you can achieve a seamless run, the visual aesthetics are so satisfying and rewarding. The main hub will allow you to access the options and all the levels, however, you must unlock new levels by completing preceding ones. There are a good number of levels available for you to test your skills, and the game offers a lot of time value if you are really into speedruns and 100% completion. During your playthrough, you must complete each level in a set amount of time, while maintaining a smooth (finesse) run. If you can finish the stage within the time limit and maintain a good combo bar, then you will achieve a double S rank (best possible score).For the achievement junkies, there is only one to collect, and this requires you to complete every level by performing the most perfect possible run. I really, really love this type of achievement system in a game, and not the stupid, meaningless artificial-game-lengthener types found in games like Lucius (which I will be reviewing soon) - where you need 20 and 40 game hours when the game takes ~10 hours to complete. No, in Dustforce DX there's just one, challenging achievement that involves you spending quite a bit of time refining your skills and experience so you can obtain those perfect runs.The game can get a bit repetitive once you've invested a large amount of time, however, the variety in level layout and different enemy types adds lots of playability. There are also different characters with slightly different attributes, allowing for a unique playstyle depending on who you select (ex: one character has quicker drops and longer jump range).If you like challenging platformers with an emphasis on finesse and score attacks, then you must give this game a try.Definitely recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												Dustforce DX is not an easy to pick up game. I'm one of the best active players in the game atm, and as you can see that my hours reflect the dedication needed to be among the of the best.However, as a casual game, while the mechanics take some getting used to, they start feeling fluid and cohesive. There are 4 action keys along w/ the arrow keys (I use keyboard), which take a ton of time to get into muscle memory. But as the difficulty increases and the game keeps teaching you different mechanics, the satisfaction from beating a difficult level is immense. The soundtrack, composed by one of the devs of the game, is simple and elegant IDM, creating a calmer atmosphere, even in the middle of spikes.I'd highly recommend this game to fans of technical platforming and those who enjoy a real challenge and have real patience in gaming. If you want to achieve a really good time, or complete that really difficult level, it'll take a while to get there. But I think the dedication and payoff is worth it.			"

												This has to be my favorite platformer on steam at the moment. I've put in 35+ hours as of writing this review, and I'll put in plenty more trying to SS every level. The difficulty ramps up quite a bit as you make your way through each level, and the seemingly simple controls open up to some fantastic speed tech once you learn a few tricks. With a replay system that allows you to watch anyone's play through of a level, you'll want to go back and improve your time trying new techniques you see other players use. It can get quite competitive between you and people on your friends list as you try to one up each other. The music is absolutely glorious. The OST itself is a great buy, definitely have that on rotation in my playlist. The art style is simple and clean, the animations are smooth and the game looks and feels better and better the faster you go. If you enjoy difficult precision platformers, or love games with mechanics that allow you to go fast, this is a purchase you won't regret.			"

												Who would have guessed: a 2D indie platformer can be challenging and difficult and yet be--gasp!--ENJOYABLE?! Considering there seems to be a trend for games that confuse challenge with stress and difficulty with laboriousness, this game is kind of a miracle.For starters, it has a learning curve. Yes: an ACTUAL LEARNING CURVE. You have some brief tutorials to help you get the hang of the controls, with are fairly complex and prety tricky to get right, and soon you're in a ""nexus"" which you can traverse and unlock levels. These levels come in different difficulties, and you hve to beat a certain number of easier levels to get keys and unlock the harder ones.As usual, the controls define about half of the playability and the fun of the game, and they work quite well here. It strikes a balance between fast, fluid, complex and challenging. Yes, it can get annoying and a little innaccurate at times, but those flaws seem to be more due to the natural limitations of keyboard controls rather than the game designers letting them suck deliberately because ""that makes it HARD!!!"". The only thing that does annoy me is how the gravity works: within a millisecond, you'll switch from ""gently floating down"" to ""plummetting like a stone"". I don't think this adds anything to the game.The levels are good, and range from flowing and pleasant to devilishly hard. So far, I've played more than half of the levels, and only one was seriously beyond my skills. The others, at their most difficult, are reasonably doable. Also, you're not expected to simply reach the end of the level: the more dust you clean up, the higher your ""Completion"" rank goes up, and the higher the combo you get at the end, the higher your ""Finesse"" rank (it took me ages to understand what that meant). The higher your ranks, the sooner you get keys to unlock the harder levels. Also, if you're really perverted, you can try to improve your time and improve your rank in the scoreboard. If you like speedrunning, you'll have a field day.Finally, I really enjoy the art style. The visuals are pretty, cartoony and slightly dreamy. The music is nice, and whomever wrote it did a pretty good job at imitating Tycho. Also, you get to choose from four different characters: the guy in blue, and... er... four others. (another gripe I have is that you have to choose your character EVERY TIME you start a level. Sheesh, why not choose once, at the beginning of the game, and let me change it later if I want to?)I'm glad I got this game, and I'm glad for the time I spent on it. I still have quite a lot to play, but I'm already satisfied. Fans of platformers should definitely take notice.			"

												No reviews for Dustforce? Surely this is a bug...Dustforce is, and most likely will be, my favorite indie game of all time. I've never really even been into speedrunning platformers, but I absolutely loved this game.The visuals. They're so simple, and are perfect for this game. It has a lovely look that never gets tiring to look at.The flow/feel. Dustforce just feels great to play. Whether it's on keyboard or controller, this game has a flow that feels like you're riding through a musical masterpiece.The soundtrack. Naturally, achieving flawless runs is what you aim for in this game, and naturally, it can get frustrating as the difficulty increases. Thanfully lifeformed (the artist) has created the absolutely perfect soundtrack for this game. The calming tunes are insanely catchy, as well as soothing to the soul as you unfortunately realize you missed a piece of dust 20% through that track you've never SS'd.The devs. They just seem like awesome people who love making games. They've released their financial information on Dustforce after all it has been through (steam, humble bundle etc), which is a rare thing to do. They also created a level editor and website for people to share! They are currently developing a new game called Spire, which will be an instant purchase for me =]tl;dr - If you have the tiniest spark of interest after seeing some screenshots or gameplay, buy it and play. You will not be dissapointed; only pleasently surprised.			"

												I do like this game, but I have a lot of trouble recommending it to anyone. The decisions the developer made here seem actively antagonistic to new players. I would have to link the game along with 3-4 different guides just to make sure whoever I recommended it to had a decent chance of enjoying it. If you have all the information it really is quite good. It's just that the game never bothers to give you the information you need in order to enjoy it.Here are the things wrong with this game.1) The tutorial is too hard. Instead of spreading the 3 tutorial levels out over time the game requires you to be able to execute even the advanced mechanics right from the beginning. I imagine some casual players may not even be able to complete these 3 tutorial levels. These levels also lack any kind of flow, and so they're also just bad levels in general.2) The tutorial is too short. The tutorial doesn't explain some very key movement mechanics that are profoundly unintuitive to the point that they are literally the opposite of reality. There's a hidden ""charge"" system the game never explains that allows you to either dash or jump in mid-air. Not all of the cases where the recharges happen are explained and so the player is left without enough information to even begin to tackle anything past the first 15 courses. The player is forced to look up a guide online or spend a lot of time randomly button mashing in order to progress.3) The ""overworld"" is dumb and confusing. Instead of the devs bothering to figure out which order the levels should be in the game has you exploring these 4 zones between the worlds in order to find new levels. Sometimes this requires executing extraordinarily difficult platforming tricks as well as a key obtained from doing really well on previous levels. The layout of this zone is very confusing, and it is very very very very very frustrating having to deal with a dumb mini-game just to get to the next course. The courses are hard enough on their own. I already did well enough on the courses in order to get the key. Just let me pick them from a menu, and don't lock content behind meaningless redundant skill gates you didn't think through properly before you implemented. It's very easy to get stuck.4) Keys aren't explained. The game doesn't explain adequately how to obtain keys. This leads to being stuck until you look up a guide online that explains how to get more keys. 5) Key colors are difficult to differentiate. I'm a little bit color-blind. The game has like 5 key colors. I can only differentiate between silver and ""the rest of them."" They bothered to make the key icons look different, but not the locks. So good luck being able to figure out where to take a key you just obtained because a) the lock colors are all very similar and b) you might not even be able to get there due to point #3.6) Character differences are not explained.  2 of them are quite similar while the other 2 are quite different from all others. It would have been nice to have been told by the game why I should ever choose a different character than the default.In conclusion, I do like this game, but don't be afraid to look up guides on how the mechanics of the game work. It's really not fun if you don't do that.I also want to reiterate again that the entire concept of The Nexus feels very much like the dev fell in love with their own ""clever"" idea, and never bothered to think through the ramifications of what they were doing. I'm sure it took a lot of time to build and design, but it only ever serves to frustrate and impede player progress to new courses. Just save yourself the trouble and look up a YouTube video that shows how to navigate to all the courses along with a map of door lock colors. You will have a much better time of it.			"

												Dustforce is perhaps the best platformer of its kind that I've ever played. It's slick, beautiful, and most importantly the movement feels perfect.The gameplay is what you expect it to be - you progress from level to level, attempting to complete it as fast as possible (with global leaderboards on time). Additional depth is added by the inclusion of your broom, used to sweep 'dust' as you run and hit 'enemies' with, building up a combo which you are rated on along with the time. Although initially the game may seem laggy or unresponsive, within a few hours you become accustomed to how the momentum and motion works in the game and begin to understand that the opposite actually holds. The game gives you perfect control, and punishes the tiniest of your mistakes.That's really where the beauty lies. The skill ceiling is incredibly high, obvious to see if you watch a speedrun of this game. The game encourages you towards this perfection, and indeed the only achievement in this game is one of completing it - a feat few people (myself not included) have achieved. There's no RNG in the game, it's just you and how you play. This is certainly not for everyone, but for those few who don't like grinding and obtaining perfect muscle memory, the game hits all the right buttonsIt is also worth mentioning the soundtrack. Some games have terrible music. Some games have good music for the game. Some have soundtracks that are amazing standalone, and this is one of them. It's (largely) calm, electronic stuff that's perfect for relaxing or concentrating too. Look it up on youtube - Fastfall by Lifeformed is the album.For me, it's one of my favourite games ever, and I haven't even put that much time into it.			"

												This is quite the unique platformer. Instead of simply jumping from any ordinary platform to the next, it takes some sort of pseudo-Sonic approach of fast paced, all-surfaces high-octane super-platforming.Let me be frank: this game is hard. Sure, it does a good job of easing you into it, but this isn't just some casual romp. Be prepared to put all your effort into getting constant SS ranks if you want to explore all the game's content.The visuals are pleasing and colorful, just a nice view for the eyes. The music is likewise calm and soothing techno, which is just as well to ease you from the rage that will transpire.The game controls butter smooth, and has a lot of depth from a rather simple means of traversing the maps. I did have one complaint about the controls, namely the lack of complete controller support. Most basic buttons are there, except the menu button. I can't even count how many times I've had to restart, and I have to do it all from going to the keyboard to press escape. Is an extra respec option too much to ask for?EDIT: Though there is no option to respec the escape menu in the controls, I found that the ""instant restart"" key in another menu is able to be bound to a controller button, which is quite swell.Another complaint I have, though not with the game, is the lack of community attention. When exploring the nexus, it is entirely up to me to find the one bronze door that I still have a key for, and it still eludes me because no one has a nexus map uploaded.All said, it's crazily addictive to the right people, namely: twitch-reflex, practice-based skill games that never stop the action.

												Worth every penny. 10/10Game's core features:Dusting/SweepingDifferent Playable CharactersPlatformingParkourSpecial GagueLevel Evaluation/Grading System (S, A, B, C, D)Easy ControlsSemi-Open environmentDusting/Sweeping: If you couldn't tell already the main idea behind this game is dusting levels with a tool that varies depending on what character you play as.Different Playable Characters: There are four playable characters, each have different tools they use to clean up the dust with: A kitchen Broom, a Push Broom, Feather Dusters and a Vacuum, each of these somehow seem to complete the characters personality, even though so far there hasn't been any dialogue. Each character has a different ""Style"" of moving about, not really sure how to describe it, but there is a slightly different feeling between each of the characters.Platforming: Not much to say here, you jump from platform to platform, however i will say the platforming isn't very repetitive and just feels right.Parkour: Not Minecraft-Style ""parkour"", we're talking runing up a wall to jump to the next wall, then jump off of that wall to reach a platform, dash to get speed jump and RUN ON THE CIELING of the next platform to procede to the next section of the level, it's incredible and you feel like a champ for pulling off these stunts.Special Gague: As you progress through each level and clean up dust, a gague at the bottom of the screen will slowly start filling up, once this gague fills completely, you can use a special move. This move is incredibly useful and does not change depending on which character you are (in one way I am glad that that's how it works, however in another way I am slightly dissapointed...) when you activate your special move your character will flash across the screen cleaning up all the dust within a certain radius of the character. It looks very much like a scene from a typical fighting anime show, but it's funny cause it's just them cleaning up dust.Level Evaluation System: You are graded on two criteria after completing a level: How much of the dust you clean up in a level (Completion), and how many times your combo meter gets set back to 0 (Finese). S is the highest grade you can reach and D is the lowest (at least I think, it's the lowest I've gotten...). Once completing a level you will be awarded points towards different keys whih will allow you to complete other levels in the game.Easy Controls: At the begining of the game you are bombarded with lots of information that seems a bit overwhelming at first, however the levels in each area ease you into learning the controls and before you know it, it's like second nature to you and you're pulling off nice fluid parkour tricks.Semi Open-Environment: Each actual level is actually not connected to another, however, you don't choose the level from the menu, instead you're navigating your character to the next doorway wich will take you to the level. It would be like the old Mega Man X games met Super Metroid. Even the game menu is navigated this way.Other Features: Hand painted graphics and a really nice ""chill out"" styled soundtrack. Reminescent of an old Sega Genesis or SNES game.			"

												I love everything that this game is about.Right off the bat, the most admirable features of Dustforce are its depth and the multifaceted ways there are to complete each stage with a perfect rank. It's a speedrunner's dream. The basic moves are simple: run, jump, dash, attack. But  check out what the most talented players can do with them.	 There is a path laid out for you, and it's up to you to decide how to traverse it. Mechanics like dashing at the end of a slope or boosting downward to increase momentum illustrate how the gameplay is meant to be experimented with, and it feels awesome. My personal favorite part of this game, though, is the atmosphere. It's self-aware, but not ""I-am-self-aware""-self-aware; there isn't an attempt at a story, there isn't any humor, there isn't even any characterization beyond some subtle win animations (without the internet, the only way we'd even know the names of the characters would be looking through the game's files). It's just the ever-so-video-game-ish premise of acrobatic janitors sweeping up and down the walls, and it's done so smoothly. The controls are easy to get used to, the animations are smooth, the environments are beautiful, and the music is soothing, composed by the awesome  Lifeformed [lifeformed.bandcamp.com].Also worth mentioning is the awesome community surrounding Dustforce. The subreddit is a pretty active place, and with replays being attached to every rank on every leaderboard, the best way to learn how to get better is by watching and learning from others.In short, if you like platformers, you should try it. If you like speedrun-able/""perfect run"" type games, definitely try it. If you're a janitor, it just might change your life.			"

												This game does not get enough praise. The skill ceiling is way up there, but it's also a fun, relaxing game to play casually. Dustforce's mechanics are a completely unique form of movement to traditional platformers. The basics may feel clunky at first, but you will gradually understand how to make good use of your abilities to do things that no other platformer can.If you're worried about the game's difficulty, there are huge amounts of community resources out there to help you get better, as well as global replays to help you understand the mechanics. That aside, the bouncy music and cheerful atmospheres make Dustforce a great game to try out for all players.If you're a completionist, or a speedrunner, you will get the most out of this game. Exploration is heavily awarded with several secrets hidden in nearly every level, and your times are automatically linked to a live global leaderboard.The only thing I would recommend before playing the game is to changing your controls from default controls to a WASD setup, so you're not dashing with your Pinky Finger. Either that or hooking up a controller if you have one.			"

												Dustforce is what most would classify as precision-platformer, a genre that I disliked. Yet this game somehow managed to be one of my favourite games. This game is just that good.First thing you'll notice is its gorgeous graphic and sound. It's very pleasant to the eyes and ears, which is something you'll need to soothe the frustration that come from this game's harsh difficulty.The gameplay is superb. When most games of the genre give you simple controls and requires you to press them at the exact timing, Dustforce has a vast array of traversal techniques for you to choose from. The game also put more emphasis on momentum. Which is why (outside of the tutorial) the game has 64 levels to train (and test) you about the more complicated techniques.  Even the overworld itself is designed in a way that requires you to perform difficult techniques to reach harder level.One last thing, you will want to have the game run at stable 60FPS because any drop in frames can spell doom to your run.

												A great platformer, but lives somewhat in the shadows of the likes of Super Meat Boy, which is a shame. Instead of just going from point A to point B, here you must travel and clean dust along the levels, while being consistent to not lose your combo. Each level can be beaten ""normally"", but only by getting SS rank on them you'll unlock keys to be able to unlock harder levels. Speaking of difficulty, the controls are a bit clunky and hard to get used at first, but soon you'll get better at basic movement which will allow you to clear the easy levels, while getting better to beat the normal levels, and with enough practice you'll be able to beat the hard levels. And this progression works well, because when you unlock the hard levels it means that you are ready for them. And once you beat the hard levels, you'll unlock the hardest levels, which are easily harder than Super Meat Boy (even some hard levels are). You'll also fail a lot, but there's some things that will keep you invested: the art and music are great, and a checkpoint system that will allow you to practice sections of a level instead of starting from the beginning every time. There's also 4 characters, and they feel different from each other. Also, the developers keep the leaderboards clean from cheaters, which is something rare. Lastly there are plenty of easter eggs to find, and only one precious achievement, but getting it displays true skill. And there's plenty of custom levels included for extra gameplay.			"

												Disclaimer: This game is hard as balls!But if you look past the difficulty you'll find a life consuming challenge, an amazing soundtrack and endless amounts of content provided by the level editor (over 1000 custom levels atm). The learning curve is massive which may not be appealing to some people but that's the thing keeps me playing after 800+ hours. I'm pretty sure that I'm capable but haven't gotten what's called SS score on the last level so I'm technically not even done yet.The level design is amazing and blends perfectly with the soundtrack. And the best part of the game: the leaderboards. Every level (including custom maps) have a leaderboard for the best SS time (cleared everything in the level) and the fastest time just to finish. And every run has intant replay so you can see how the best player does or how the worst player doesn't :PMany may compare Dustforce to Super Meat Boy but I would disagree mostly because of the controls but also because of the fact that dustforce has some brawler elements. At first glance you may feel that dustforce has floaty controls where meat boy feels more slick but dustforce's ""floaty"" controls imo Allows for more precise maneuvering. A thing to mention on controls is that I recommend using a keyboard or a controller with a good D-pad (instantly ruling out 360 controller) like PS3 or 4. You could use analog sticks... but you're gonna have a bad time if you do that.So my honest opinion: The best platformer ever made. A very hard but fair challenge. The best comunity in a game I've encountered.			"

												This is the amazing game, one of my 1st steam purchases ever, and I still love it till today:+Soundwork: OST is the biggest plus of this game, amazing music, and other sound effects are very smooth. Great soundwork.+Visuals: Great pixelated graphics, with cool style, so even pixelated the game looks pretty smooth. Great effects - dust, leafs etc, infected animals looks cool before and after. A pleasure to see.+Gameplay: Has its pros and cons - one the one hand - this game is amazing platformer with сrаpton of levels + community map packs - on the other hand - after sometimes game gets really difficult, making its nearly impossible to fully complete, so you can enjoy a lot of easy/medium levels but not beat the game, or you can enjoy all levels but sweat your a55 off - would enjoy if you are hardcore platformer fan.Oh, you also have 4 characters to pick with different stats!+Controls - pretty smooth reliable controls, most likely this game is better with a controller.+Steam cards-The one and only steam achievement is nearly impossible to get - like 0.3% of people got it.After all, this game is amazing, stylish and fun to play platformer that also good if you like HARD games.

												I am not a speed runner. But if i was, this game would be awesome. You play as one of four types of cleaner ninja and try navigate levels in the shortest time with the highest score. After each level you get your leaderboard ranking and can watch runs of other ranked players to try and figure out how they pulled this stuff off. The game also has a level editor and a lot of user created levels. The soundtrack is amazing both in game and out. There is also a multiplayer component that i didn't get to try out. If speed running isn't appealing to you, then you probably won't like this. If its something you are interested in getting into, then yeah give this a go.Note - If you are visually impared, SOME levels will have contrast issues where distinguishing between various ineractable objects will be difficult.

Mr. Clean's Got Nothing On This TeamSweep dust up and make it look awesome while doing so. It's a great concept, beautiful and simplistic art, and has bopping tracks you can't resist dancing to. I loved the soundtrack so much, I went out and bought the bundle. It's also one of the better indie-platformers I've played; makes someone like me, who is garbage at platformer, feel good about succeeding.Just don't risk shift+tabbing out while you're in the middle of a level. I'd do that to reply to someone and sometimes the game would make me redo the entire level from the beginning. That's about the only criticism I have with it. Otherwise, sound, gameplay, and aesthetics are very pleasant. The soundtrack is available from the composer on YouTube here. Even if you don't pick up this game, at least give these beautiful tracks a listen. My favorites are Cider Time, 9-bit Expedition, and Your Favorite Color.8/10			"

Superb aesthetic and audio, as can be seen in the trailer, and when you finally manage to do an S-rank level, you move with a sort of beautiful flow and skill you would normally only find if you were watching a speedrun, except it's you doing it. Perhaps this is because time is part of the S-rank, practically making getting an S-rank speedrunning and dulling the game for regular speedrunners, but it was a first for me.			"

												Dustforce is…Dustforce is a fast paced, terribly difficult, hair pulling infuriating platformer, and I love it. I hate it, but I love it. You’re part of the Dustforce, charged with ridding the world from… dust! Go figure, right? I had my reservations about it at first, but as it turns out, it’s a really fun platformer game. The gameplay is simple (and the keyboard controls are simple, too), yet at the same time, complicated. You clean this dust by simply touching it or smacking dusty creatures. You have jumps, double jumps, dashes, normal hit, hard hit, and a few wall and ceiling grabbing skills depending on key combinations used. This requires plenty of skills, because while you’re essentially only using like 3-4 buttons at most, you have to do so in a specific order with a specific timing in order to reach certain ledges/floors/areas. And this, my friends, is where it gets difficult. The levels are progressively difficult, requiring you to hone your button-pressing order/timing skills in order to complete them. While you don’t have to mop away every single trace of dust, you -are- graded at the end according to your performance, and you will need the keys awarded from this to unlock certain levels. The better you do, the easier to unlock those levels. There’s only one achievement for the game (which made me lol a little). The graphics are very nice and simple, they make the game stand out and seem pretty unique, and I really loved it. The character moves around the screen with pretty amazing fluidity, and I just love to see them dash and jump and double jump, and do all kinds of parkour-y things. Dustforce also has a level editor for you to play around in and fiddle to your heart’s content, and you’re able to share your levels with other users. If you’re a fan of platformers and/or difficult games, I really recommend it! If you’re not, steer clear, it’s bound to drive you insane!			"

												This is one of the most incredible games I've ever played. Let me just start by saying if you're looking to blaze through this game to play every level it won't be that easy. You will need to dedicate some time to mastering the gameplay, and acquire the skills nessecary to complete it. The control is unreal for me even better than Super Meat Boy's which is insane, because I thought Super Meat Boy's control was absolutely perfect this just pushes the limits of polished controls. This is what difficult platformers should be where you learn by playing one level later get to a more advanced one, and can already feel and percieve what you need to do to accomplish the tasks at hand. It has four different characters each with their own unique playstyle and feel. It's just such a rewarding experience to learn how to pick up every piece of garbage, defeat every foe, and keep your combo up in each level and perfect them bringing you one step closer to completing the game. The only con I have for this game is that you have to complete every level 100% in order to complete it which might lower the accessibility a bit. I highly recommend playing this game on controller I felt so lost playing it on keyboard.			"

												One of the reasons Dustforce sticks out from so many games on the market right now is because it knows EXACTLY what it is, and doesn't try to be anything else other than that. It is essentially a speedrunning game, in which you play an acrobatic broom clad hero (there are four playable characters with varying stats). The goal of each level is to clean as much as possible as fast as possible. Completion and Finesse (which is your cleaning combos) are both graded, and it's oh-so enticing to shoot for an S rank. It's a simple idea, and executed quite well. The movement system is precise and interesting, and all of the levels are designed the system in mind. This creates a really strong gameplay experience which can be missed in a lot of games. The soft visuals and calming tunes create a very warm and pleasant mood. (I'd like to add that the animation is absolutely superb!) Dustforce is an excellently done and unique game, and those looking for an addictive platformer will likely be satisfied with it's cleanly charm.			"

												In Dustforce speedruns aren't the meta-game, they ARE the game. If you can enjoy the precision and timing involved in such endeavors you won't be disappointed. If you enjoy watching other players' speedruns you won't be disappointed (and in a sense, this is your reward for at least finishing a level).I think Dustforce stands out in the design more than actual gameplay (you can get a similar challenge from e.g., Super Meat Boy). The game is distilled in the art design, character design, and level design. That's not to say it's sparse, the levels are often beautiful, but there is very little that doesn't directly serve the game. There's very little narrative. There's not a lot of moving parts and gimmicks. It's simply: here's an obstacle course, find the shortest course and execute perfectly (with a few exceptions for arena stages; here's a room full of enemies, flawlessly defeat them).The soundtrack to the game is excellent, and one of my all time favorites. Definitely check out the composer's web page.This is a game for all ages and abilities. I often play this with my 2.5 year-old son. He likes to watch the colorful characters run around cleaning and making the animals and people happy. In the hubs he will just make the people sweep and jump around and narrate the action. He likes the music, too. Older kids will be able to finish a lot of the levels and have fun doing it. Parents might be interested to know there's next to no violence in single player, since the sweeping ""attacks"" are really cleaning off the inhabitants of the stages and they are largely greatful for it. The biggest drawback to me, is that progression is entirely linked to perfecting skills. Most of you will eventually reach a plateau where you've unlocked every level you can and you're stuck trying endlessly to improve your times and combos on the hardest levels. There's no ""grind"" to ""brute force"" your way forward, you either get good or accept defeat. Judging from the global achievement (there's only one) stats, around 90% of players will not unlock the highest levels. Less than 1% have perfected every level. You can't see everything even as just a tourist.I'm disappointed there isn't a wider set of achievements to build some meta-game around.			"

												This is not a game you can complete by chance or effortless tries.

Well, actually it does, but gently. You start from levels which is almost impossible to fail, yet everything in the game reminds you that anything less of a ""perfect run"" (double S rating) is worthless, that your times are awfully high.You will then take a look at some videos or replays.

												Great speed-run platformer that you can play casually or competitively. The levels start out pretty easy enough but then they get to god-like levels of difficulty. One thing I don't like about the game is that there is only achievement and it requires you to master every level in order to get it. Also, the controls are kinda strange at first, I almost gave up on this game until I found a key-map that I liked. It's a pretty great platformer overall though that requires some real level of skill to master!4/5Map your keys as follows;WASD --> MovementL --> DashP --> Jump; --> Light Attack' --> Hard Attack			"

												The concept behind Dustforce is really pretty cool. It's basically Super Meat Boy with some sort of janitors as main characters. You defeat enemies by slamming them with your broom while running/jumping/gliding/sliding around the level (Meat Boy style !) sweeping the leaves that lay around. You get scored for speed and effectiveness and it's actually extremely difficult. Especially if you want to earn S ranks for every level.The thing is... the controls just don't feel right. Controllers aren't automatically recognized and configured so you have to do that yourself. A controller definitely works better than a keyboard, I can tell you that, but if you don't know how to properly set it up it's still really hard to play.I did finish Super Meat Boy, but I won't be able to finish this until they succesfully implement controller functionality without the player having to mess around with it.Controller issues aside, this is a great game that just needs to be experienced.[Rating: 78/100]			"

												This game is truly a masterpiece regarding mechanics and soundtrack. The depth and skill level required for some of the bonus levels is mind-boggling, and it's the most satisfying feeling to climb up the leaderboards and compete against your friends.

												I wouldn't call myself a Jump'n Run fan, but every now and then a strong title appears and sucks me in with its addictive flow state.Dustforce is one of those games, that are repetitive in the best possible way. Where many games are a sequence of similar levels, each played a single time, Dustforce is a set of unique challenges, which have to be tried again and again to be mastered.Let's talk about the game's overall structure first. The player is thrown into a hub world, filled with several doors, which lead to the individual levels. While in theory the player can reach every door from the start, most of them are locked with bronze, silver or golden padlocks. Those levels already accessible, need to be played to unlock bronze doors, which again are required for silver keys and so forth. In order to open all locks of a kind, every level below that kind has to be finished with a top ranking (more on that later) — but lower rankings accumulate and can unlock at least some of the higher levels as well.This is a great way to keep the player within the flow curve. Hard levels — and boy, they get hard — can't be accessed until the player has proven his/her salt. And by using a ranking system the game makes sure, that the player actually played well and didn't just luckily stumble over the finish line. On the other hand, players are still able to unlock a few new levels, as long as they at least perform okay.There is a second design decision preventing players from taking challenges above their skill level. I mentioned earlier, that levels are accessed through a hub world. Within that hub world, the level doors aren't just lined up, like they are in Rayman Legends for example. Instead the hub world is a level itself, where the doors have to be reached.Doors to simple levels can be reached by walking, with a few occasional jumps in between. Doors of more difficult levels require skill and a solid understanding of different movement mechanics. And to top it all: it's not like you need any arbitrary trick, but exactly those skills needed within the level you are trying to reach. By this, the game makes sure you know what to do in every level.Let's talk about level structure next. Most levels are linear, with a clear route and a bad guy to beat up at the end. There is dust on the floor (or on the ceiling or wherever) that the avatar brushes away automatically when running over it. The interface has a combo counter, indicating how much dust has been collected. If no dust is swept for five seconds or the player gets hit or dies, the combo is interrupted and the counter reset.After finishing a level, the player is evaluated for the amount of dust cleaned (completion) and the number of combo interruptions (finesse). To get a double S (and unlock a key) all dust has to be collected without a single interruption.Evaluating both completion and finesse is a clever way to ensure good play. Abusing blinking time or brute forcing every single obstacle won't bring you the necessary finesse to advance. Using shortcuts to pass by hard sections won't work either, because dust in skipped sections is guaranteed to be missed. You can use these techniques to finish a level of course — and some levels can be done ridiculously fast using shortcuts, — but harder levels are reserved for good players.All this dynamic balancing is necessary to keep players engaged while they still learn how the game is played. Dustforce has a lot of movement techniques, from sliding down slopes over fast-falling to running at the ceiling. Every movement requires precise input. In contrast to the heavily automated system of an Assassins Creed, your avatar in Dustforce will do nothing that you don't tell him/her explicitly.Unfortunately not all of Dustforce's options are taught properly. The game starts with a set of three solid tutorials, explaining most important aspects — how to reset your double-jump for example. Abstruse, while nevertheless useful, techniques like spike-jumping on the other hand, are left unmentioned.It took me a few hours (and a good youtube tutorial) to ""get"" the controls and gain a solid level of mastery. Those few hours weren't boring at all though and the top-class Jump'n Run I got in return was a satisfying trade.There isn't so much, that I want to say about Dustforce's aesthetics, but I can't let them be unmentioned.The game's sprites have few details and let their well-chosen color pallets speak instead. I also like how the four playable characters differ in design. Each of them cleans with another tool, from broom to vacuum cleaner, and color, animations and hats all differ too. I'm particularly fond of Dustworth's design, who looks like Luigi got old fast after exorcising his mansion.There are few sound effects — and no voices at all — but that almost feels intentional to underline the game's great chiptune soundtrack. Almost all songs are strong enough to stand their own, but they accompany each levels theme pretty well too.Mechanics, structure, balancing and aesthetics all interlock and support each other just right. When I started Dustforce, I was expecting a satisfying high complexity platformer, but the game is so fine tuned and works so well that I'm surprised that it isn't more popular. I highly recommend it for every Jump'n Run fan out there.Read more of my reviews at:theguygaming.com "

												An amazing platformer with hundreds of custom level available at the dustforce website. The physics are different from most other games. It can be difficult to keep your momentum, but once you get the hang of the movement in this game, it can provide fun for hours. The difficulty spikes rapidly, and a perfect run of each level is required to unlock all the next tier levels until the X-Difficult levels, which are a long ways harder than any other set of levels in the game. The level unlocking method is rather lackluster, but the game is amazing once you ""get it"" after getting it.			"

												The best janitorial emulation I've ever played.Jokes aside, what originally attracted to me to Dustforce was a feeling that something was missing from Super Meat Boy, something that the game didn't seem to quite capture or address. It was difficult, but in a way that let me put it down and step away from it, knowing I could always come back at a later date and defeat it. The music was good, but I don't know that I could hum a tune from it right now. The level design was well thought out, but often times only allowed for one method of play.Dustforce takes every one of these (admittedly small) complaints and addresses them: the technical skills required to beat some of the levels that ensure you can't set it down and come back to it without having to remaster things, the decision to design the game from the get-go with speed-running in mind, and a soundtrack that is as catchy as it is lovely...the list goes on and on.Without gushing on for too long about it, I recommend Dustforce as highly as I can recommend anything, provided that you know what you want in a platformer. This game will be hard and it will be unforgiving, assuming you attempt to play it at the highest level. The level design will keep pulling you back in, making you wonder if you could have shaved off a second or two by doing this loop slightly differently. The technical skill required will make you consider purchasing a keyboard that actually works (Apple keyboards are now my chief complaint with Apple computers). In short, if mountains were video games, Everest almost compares to Dustforce.			"

												I would give Dustforce a 10/10, for being an excellent, addictive, and challenging but rewarding platformer.Dustforce is a platforming game where your goal is to navigate rooms in different levels of a mansion in order to clean them, for you are the worlds most awesome custodian. Don't be turned off by that description, for each of the 4 characters you can choose from has special abilities that make them able to clean in no way seen before. You are more like a ninja than a cleaner, and you can dart through levels creating combos as you clean dust and fight off enemies to clear the level. You earn points for how well you do, which eventually unlocks keys to more rooms, etc.In order to unlock every level though, you must eventually complete each level by cleaning every speck of dust without breaking your combo. The combo window is long enough to allow you to use differing forms of strategy, but just short enough to induce high levels of muscle tension when you are trying to keep it going over long distances. This can easily be the biggest turn off of the game, and the level of perfection required to fully beat the game is astounding when you reach the veteran levels. Some may find that frustrating and too much of a roadblock, which is understandable. On the other hand (I have never beaten all the levels, and never will) Dustforce has enough content to provide a fun playthrough to suit the difficulty level you wish to attain. More of a casual player? You have plenty of levels that are loads of fun to play. Looking for a challenge after getting the basics? Dustforce provides a good set of intermediate levels, all the way up to insanely hard.The controls feel great, the characters move fluidly, and no 2 levels are the same. Each character can provide a different strategy, and some are much more usefel than others on specific levels. The game provides the opportunity to watch the playthroughs of any player who has completed a level, meaning that you can learn some good strategies from some very good players.Especially for only a few bucks, Dustforce is a great game that shouldn't be missed if you like platformers.

												I was just browsing one day and I found a video talking about Dustforce. It successfully caught my attention and I dove right in.I sucked, I was awful and I couldn't figure out all the mechanics at first. But the game does everything in steps, It's harsh but indifferent. As I kept playing lightbulbs would turn on, routes I would never consider started showing up. 94 hours later I found myself having all the stages fully completed. I should be putting this game down but I still feel motivated to keep improving my times.This is a product made with a lot of thought and love. If you want to be challenged by a game, this is the place to be. The community is really helpful and there's a lot to do with the custom maps being avaliable.			"

												I enjoy video games. I like the thrill of shooting monsters and solving sliding puzzles, I relish exploring the world and having adventures in it, I love seeing my cities and theme parks grow because I made them just so. Crawling through dungeons, directing your minions strategically to best your foe, sneaking around conspiracy theory-laden faculties – video games are a rich medium with terrific entries in all kinds of experience. And even though I don’t particularly enjoy role-playing games, I can see why it’s pleasing to build and personalize a character of your making and vanquish your enemies. Even in a world with such a varied library of enterprises, there’s a single holy grail for me: finesse.Let’s use my favorite game of 2012, Dustforce, to illustrate. Dustforce is a platformer made Hitbox Team, a group of four people. It stars four janitors (the eponymous “Dustforce”) who are put up against stages filled with leaves, rubbish, slime, and other waste that they can aptly clean up by swinging their broom (which involves walking over it). They’re not your average grumpy, unshaven, high school brutes though – they’re agile acrobats who can climb walls, hang on ceilings and traverse the most dangerous of environments. However, it’s not the dangerous environments that are the main objective of the game (though they will certainly test you, especially later), it’s finishing the stages completely clean – and herein lies the game’s greatest strength. The game measures two things, and rates you, at the end of the stage, accordingly: completion and finesse. Completion is the percentage of dust you cleaned up and enemies you defeated. Finesse is how often you lost your combo, preferably never – it’s a meter at the bottom of the screen that tracks how long it has been since you last dutifully scraped the last specks off the floor, and you lose it after a given amount of time. These two combined make for a drive to hone your abilities and learn every stage so that you sweep through it both smoothly and flawlessly.The levels themselves are created in such a way that doing it right will give you a great flow through it, never really slowing down or losing a beat, making for a great sense of satisfaction when you finish them thoroughly. Not only that, but the stages gently go from very easy but enjoyable to an excruciating but very gratifying hard. If you happen to run into the later stages when you’re still a rookie cleaner, they will seem daunting to you, almost impossible. When you come back later, however, you suddenly realize how it’s done, and after a few runs, you will be able to beat that which looked to be so insurmountable to you earlier. It’s this “I can’t believe I did that” feeling, this ascendancy, that is so bliss. And it’s never because you upgraded your fanciful armor at a merchant, or upgraded your cannon with gems, it’s just you. You, physically, became more dexterous and skilled at this game. Your character didn’t gain any new abilities, he didn’t become stronger, you did. The realization of this is an amazing feeling, because it’s so fair – you put time into this, and you reaped the benefits by knocking out the obstacles in ways you earlier never thought possible.Reinforcing this sentiment in Dustforce is the sleek graphic style, emphasizing the player’s action through a simple, but well animated, cel shaded style which make the janitors a joy to look at while they bounce through the environment. These environments, too, look great – while clearly being what they are (a city, a mountainous forest, a laboratory, and a crumbling mansion) they are presented in stylish, sometimes almost surreal ways, making for an aestethically pleasing journey through them. Also accompanying these is a terrific soundtrack, which never gets monotonous or annoying, even if you spend hours perfecting those later levels. It’s these elements that make mastering Dustforce a real joy, and here’s hoping many more follow its ways.			"

												Tough-as-nails platformer. But god damn if it doesn't feel incredible to flow up ceilings, walls, and over spiky spiky pits once you get good at it. It's pretty much got all the bells-and-whistles move mechanics, including wall and celing runs, double jumps, 4-way dashes, and screen-clearing special moves. The mechanics are tuned to the point where there are 4 characters that ostensibly are amost identical, but those with a trained game-feel can tell they are worlds apart.Plus the music is incredible.

If you're that sort of gamer, there's tons of depth here. If you're not, then the music is soothing and the early levels can be incredibly zen-like if you don't take it too seriously...though you will unfortunately be gated to them unless you suddenly become really good.

												Dustforce is a great game, but I am mostly going to complain here because it has some failings which reduce what otherwise might have been a perfect game to merely a great game.The game feels rushed. I suspect the developers got tired and simply published it before it was perfect, and then they never went back and fixed some of the issues mentioned below.This is a platformer game which desperately needs controller support, but has none. You must manually configure each button in the game options, and even after you do, you can't bring up the options menu, and then you can't use the keyboard to navigate the menu. This means you still must use the keyboard to control the game, even if you want to use a controller.Want to restore the default buttons? There is no way to do it. Hope you wrote it down beforehand.The game is missing a story or background. It's obvious that there are four antagonists to go along with the four protagonist characters, but outside of multiplayer, you can't play them. I suspect these boss fights were simply left out of the game.Multiplayer is a joke. "

												Dustforce is a masterpiece. The controls, although somewhat difficult to pick up, are the most fluid and technical of any platformer I've ever played. The skill ceiling is through the roof, and even after hours and hours of gameplay it's difficult to complete, and subsequently perfect the harder levels the game has to offer. If you enjoyed super meat boy, or ssbm, this game is definitely for you. Mechanics are rock solid, soundtrack is Beautiful/10, stage and sprite design is 9/10 just because Abyss and Backup Shift are ugly. My best advice if you want to play this game is to just spend some time with it. It may take a few hours before you really get a good feel for the controls, and it will take many hours before you have any semblance of mastery. But nonetheless communjty is great and dustforce is one of my favorite games of all time.			"

												Dustforce is slick, fluid, relaxing. Well, providing you're any good at it.I'm not very good at Dustforce, but I still enjoy it a lot. I'm pretty clumsy with both a keyboard or a controller, I'm fairly certain the input doesn't matter, a skilled player can dance through the levels whilst a clumsier player like myself will find multiple ways to blame the controller whilst really it's the player at fault.Completing a level isn't good enough, you have to go over and over, to get that S / S rating, shaving off seconds, perfecting a route, figuring the perfect peaceful and flowing pattern that will earn you a perfect and you can move on. Practice makes perfect.The animations are beautiful and smooth, matching the gameplay style and giving everything a wonderful flow. The soundtrack is amazing, helping your mind hit that half-focused, half-zen-like concentration zone.I'll never complete Dustforce, I'll never get S / S on many of the levels, I'm not even good enough to even GET to many of the levels in the hub world (they're hidden away out of reach, requiring a certain precision and timing of skills to climb to them)... But I still enjoyed the game, and I'd recommend it to others... It's a fun way to spend a couple of hours. Providing you're not going in for 100% completion, anyway. Only madness or a godlike zen-state await those who would dare.			"

												Dustforce is pretty darn awesome.It's a keyboard-friendly and really difficult platformer.4 playable characters that are unlocked from the start.The music is chill and the game itself is surprisingly chill, I don't rage at Dustforce, I just try again, that's pretty special.Not that expensive and I would recommend it for it's full price if you're even somewhat into platformers and/or tidying your room.

The concept is a bit weird, but you play as one of various cleaning men, sweeping dust off the floor and defeating monsters made out of garbage.

												This game I purchased for the music alone.The gameplay is difficult but rewarding, and incredibly fluid. I've never played a platformer that felt this awesome. I highly recommend ditching the x360 wired for this and using the Sega Saturn USB controller, it feels perfect for this game.There are a large selection of levels that will take most people a LONG time to unlock due to the way the difficulty curve ramps up.Amazing, just needs some tweaks to multiplayer and it could be the Super Smash Bros.

												There are so many amazing things to say about this game.First off, something I usually look forward to in a game: the soundtrack. It's absolutely amazing! Right from the tutorial level, I got excited just hearing the music, and couldnt wait to hear the rest of the game's soundtrack. The game itself looks very visually stunning. Something I like is that each level has its own theme, and when selecting levels, you also get to jump around the environment to get to the levels, which gives you an idea what the actual levels themselves will be like. Each environment has a different thing you have to clean; There's sludge for one level, leaves for another, etc. etc.. I thought that was a nice touch. But the whole game is nicely animated and well-drawn!! <3Now to the important part: Gameplay. This has to be the best part of the game; The controls actually may take a bit used to get to, but practicing is fun!! You have to be quick when finishing levels (as well as making sure you don't mess up), since breaking your combo will give you a lower score. This gets a bit frustrating if you want perfect scores on the levels, but it's hard to stay frustrated at this game, since the visuals are amazing and the music is rather calming. There are plenty of levels to play, so don't worry about the game being too short. If you're a completionist who loves platformers, I reccomend you pick up this game! There's alot to offer!Overall, I'd give this game an 8/10. Great soundtrack combined with stunning visuals, though the controls can take a bit of practice, I'd say you should definantly get this game if you like platforming games!! (and possibly if you're a clean-freak)			"

												Had I written this review a week after buying Dustforce, the text box would have been filled only with the words  TOO SODDING HARD  in bold type. Now, after about 20 hours of playtime I can safely say that this game is really worth the effort.Dustforce is a single-player speedy platformer clean-‘em-up with resemblance to games such as Super Meat Boy. The aim of each level is to dash around cleaning the objective dirt off the various walls, floors and enemies in the fastest time possible, and by ""enemies"" I use the word very loosely. When you come across one of these dusty creatures you simply smack them a few times with your broom until they are thoroughly clean. The woodland animals then drop to the floor unharmed, which I find easier to live with than the Tomb Raider style destruction of wild animals; this way they’re just getting squeaky clean.At the end of each level you are presented with two ranks: one for completion and one for finesse. The aim is to get the highest rank in both areas by cleaning up all the scum in the level without breaking streak. When you do so, you get a key to a harder level. One of my favourite aspects of Dustforce is the menus, which are like independent levels where the goal is to find the actual levels of the game. All the game mechanics and physics are present here, so if you can’t access a level it’s either because you don’t have a key to it or you just suck. Another great part of the game is the replays that get uploaded at the end of each level and the scoreboard that is also shown, as it lets you know who’s the fastest duster in town. For most of the levels it’s a guy named Thor claiming #1, and by clicking next to his name you can watch Thor diving through the level.It’s a game I have 20 hours in and still believe I’ve only scraped the surface. If you do get round to playing this masterpiece beware of spikes, stone faces and the fact that you’re not Thor.			"

												I'm writing a review for this because I'm damn sure it doesn't get enough love. Out of any game on Steam, I'd say this is the most underrated game I've seen. It's got the smoothest, most in depth movement I've seen in a platformer. It's got a wide variety of levels, going from easy as hell to way beyound Super Meat Boy difficulty. It's got a good score system, music, and the art style is just beautiful. The huge variety, low skill floor, and incredibly high skill ceiling make this an absolute masterpiece. This game is in my all time top 10. Great job Hitbox Team.			"

												Dustforce is an amazing platformer.  It feels, looks, and sounds extremely smooth and pleasent.  It's a score chase of sorts, where you can race for the best time, but I feel like I'm always trying to get the smoothest run possible, not the fastest time.  It's incredible in that you can fail over and over again and yet not feel frustrated.  And when you finally succed, you are rewarded by feeling completely amazing about a run you just made that never had any mistakes and looked super grateful.Of all the platformers I've played, I like Dustforce the most.  The music is absolutely perfect, the gameplay is extremely solid and consistent, and graphics are beautiful.  It also has multiplayer and a level editor!    The replayability is great too, because sometimes you just want to go back to old maps and perform them smoother than you could before.  I would rate Dustforce a 10/10.			"

												Dustforce is a really smooth platform game, with a big focus on stylish and fast ways to clear the levels. With an included level editor, and leaderboards available for all levels ever uploaded- it becomes a very competetive experience, especially since you can watch every (!) player's replay in-game. You can try to redo their runs and improve upon them- to climb the leaderboards, and feel like the king of the big internet arcade.The game itself is very challenging, but selfexplanatory and easy to learn. The progress you make as a player is always clearly visible and definitely satisfying. If you want online challenges- there's plenty available; if you want to play just for yourself- there are medals at the end of each level, to reward you with a bit of singleplayer experience.It's big, fun, and sometimes frustrating to play; but even if you can't get very far- there is always the great artstyle to gaze upon, and chill soundtrack to soothe your nerves (not to mention level editor, where you can make your own kind of experience).I love this game and I definitely recommend it; but it's hard for me to tell whether I like the game better, or just it's beautiful soundtrack (STRONGLY ADVISED TO PLAY THE TRAILER).

The game guides you along in a way that teaches you the game without any intrusive tutorials telling you exactly what you do.

You always want to get that SS, you'll play that one level for hours trying to perfect it. Do not be fooled though, this game is not for the weak of heart. It is very difficult.

The concept is a bit weird, but you play as one of various cleaning men, sweeping dust off the floor and defeating monsters made out of garbage. Using the abilities to cling onto walls and double jump, Dustforce turns out to be an extremely fast-paced game that taxes your reflexes.This game is an absolute nightmare for achievement collectors: it only has one achievement--and that's for completing the game with 100% success--a task that is absurdly difficult.

												Dustforce keeps you playing by telling you that you did good, but that you could still do a whole lot better.I've found myself repeating a single level mutliple times, with the hopes of improving my time by a tiny amount, and crawling that little bit higher on the leaderboard. The feeling of  joy i got after reaching the top 100 of a leve left me a strong sense of accomplishment. Very few games have made me feel like this.The game itself has a lot of content, with the amount of time i have there are still official levels i havent touched, And with the in game map editor, there is a lot more i can do still after completing those levels.This game caters mostly to hardcore players, as the game's difficult can increase significantly, and many community made levels are also difficult. But there are many levels which are not too diffcult.There is also a speedrunning element to the game ,with a leaderboard with built in replays so you can not only observe your own past attempts, but those of the top and even bottom players.To summarise: Dustforce is a game for hardcore players that never lets you settle for being mediocre.

												Dustforce is an amazing platformer.  It feels, looks, and sounds extremely smooth and pleasent.  It's a score chase of sorts, where you can race for the best time, but I feel like I'm always trying to get the smoothest run possible, not the fastest time.  It's incredible in that you can fail over and over again and yet not feel frustrated.  And when you finally succed, you are rewarded by feeling completely amazing about a run you just made that never had any mistakes and looked super grateful.Of all the platformers I've played, I like Dustforce the most.  The music is absolutely perfect, the gameplay is extremely solid and consistent, and graphics are beautiful.  It also has multiplayer and a level editor!    The replayability is great too, because sometimes you just want to go back to old maps and perform them smoother than you could before.  I would rate Dustforce a 10/10.			"

												If you finished Super Meat Boy and need some more insane but very tight and polished platforming, this is probably one of the best places to head. It's a bit more complex in terms of the moves and controls you have available to you and which you need to master, but it only takes a few levels before you start getting a pretty good feel for how everything links together and flows. Doing it perfectly and as quickly as possible is another matter entirely, but it feels good when you start being able to maintain your momentum properly. The presentation of the game isn't nearly as slick as the mechanics (e.g. it can be a little non-obvious what to do after the tutorial), but everything necessary is distinct, recognizable, and functional after a little time with it.

I highly recommend ditching the x360 wired for this and using the Sega Saturn USB controller, it feels perfect for this game.There are a large selection of levels that will take most people a LONG time to unlock due to the way the difficulty curve ramps up.Amazing, just needs some tweaks to multiplayer and it could be the Super Smash Bros.

With great style and flare with finesse your way though the levels with ninja like skill as a janitor. Dustforce has the soft setting and mesmerizing soundtrack that will make you drop coin for it.

You have to ""clean"" the map with perfect combo to get keys to unlock the harder levels. In some cases, you have to actually use your skills to be able to get to/unlock some maps.

												A most enjoyable platformer that's equally pleasing in aesthetics, gameplay, and music. The (customizable) controls are limited in number so as not to be overwhelming, yet despite this the character actions, including inventive combos, are fun and enjoyable to watch. I absolutely LOVE the overall design/style of the game -- simple shapes, visually engaging worlds, and cool graphics -- and the soundtrack alone is worth the price tag (seriously, I'd be content with just listening to the soundtrack for hours; music can be a make-or-break deal for me in a game, and this one certainly delivers). My only complaint is that it's a *bit* difficult sometimes getting on ledges because of how the up button/control works in conjuction with jump, but that's a minor, more personal, issue. If anything, it makes the game more challenging, which is welcome in itself. For just $10.00, this thing is freakin' awesome. If you love platformers, fun and engaging environments, and awesome music, your money will not go to waste on Dustforce.			"

												Dustforce is a videogame.In it, you go very fast, sweep up the dust, you're a janitor man, lady, girl, old man, start at the start, end when the level says it's over, sweep the dust and wack the dust monsters as you goThe dust leads the way, so that your instincts are all you need; make the jump, do the slide: the power is in your handsThe music sooths and checkpoints about. There is no need for a game over screen when the point is graceful iteration. there will be frustrating hiccups, but the game is earnest: it wants you to succeed, and it does its best to get out of the way Levels teach you the skills you need to advance, with the grace and subtlety of a janitorial mr miyagi, and you say why have i been sweeping all this time, when am i going to learn karate? you knew it all along. but you're supposed to sweep anyway, you're a janitor. please be serious.the elevator pitch: sonic the hedgehog, if sonic was actually a good game and had good levels, with an emphasis on speed, grace, fluidity, and perfectionit is one of a few games i've ever bothered getting 100%. this one's worth every penny. god bless "

Grr Yotta.Edit 3/13/2016: The first mod for dustforce came out a few days ago adding a couple new modes for players to compete in.  Low% is a format we've ben running for awhile but now has leaderboards, and boss mode involves spreading dust and has really strange routing.  It will be awhile before its solved for any level.			"

												No Frills, just good solid platforming. Precise timing and perfect execution are required to progress to the difficult levels.  If you want a casual platforming game look elsewhere, because this is for the people who want to punish themselves with retry after retry to get that ""perfect"" run.  It's frustrating at times, but just making it through one of the later levels feels like an accomplishment in itself.  First runs through levels are like platforming puzzles, and it's really fun to see the creative skills you learn to get through the more difficult sections.  There is something else here though, and I can't recommend this game without mentioning it.  This game has such a great flow to it that, along with the sweet soundtrack, put me in such a mood that hours in this game, even if those hours are re-dos all on one level, are super enjoyable.  Hitting all the dust on a run without slowing reminds me very much of hitting a platinum on trials evolution.  TL;DR If you enjoyed the difficulty of the hard levels of Super Meat Boy and/or Trials Evolution, then I would recommend this game.			"

The new content moves every level into one mega Nexus to no longer require separate themed nexuses, adds 16 new core levels and a whopping 109 of the best community made maps, fixes the ranking bug in Wired, and includes yet another excellent new track by Lifeformed.

												Dustforce is a well-constructed platformer that emphasizes precision in such a flowing manner that it's easy to feel like the technique required is more luck than skill. It isn't really a platformer for someone looking for a quick drive-by game, and while there are lots of technique intensive platformers this one definitely stands out. Going through the motions of the game and then watching replays of the top runs through each level makes it very easy for the player to feel very unskilled at the game. I think it's easy to have a love/hate relationship with the controls in the game. Be willing to change them to something more comfortable if you find their initial configuration unpleasant to work around. Try the game on a gamepad or arcade stick. They ARE responsive controls, but I know that I didn't feel like that immediately. Adapting to the idiosyncracies of a game makes it more intuitive and this game will most likely require some adaptation. The game physics and the controls will require precise timing and attention to detail to progress through it.The game looks fairly nice, and the soundtrack is beautiful. There's lots of levels to run through, and an editor if you like playing around with the tools.DO buy this game if you enjoy technical platformers with non-combat goals.Dustforce DX changed the layout of the levels a bit, and added different tutorial levels to explain a few techniques a little better. They're much better at teaching some of the techniques, but don't think of them as a barrier to the rest of the game. Go out and try a few of the levels and just run around the Nexus to get a feel for the game.			"

												Not only is the game absolutely amazing, but the soundrack is well worth listening to if you dislike platformers.Did you enjoy Super Meat Boy? Buy this. Just buy it. $10 is a bargain, it could easily be $20 and still worth your money. This game is essentially a Super Meat Boy style platformer, but with the more momentum based gameplay of N combined. If you look up Dustforce Thor, you can watch the YouTube video ""All About Thor"" and see what I mean. This game is all about skill, momentum, and score, where every time you play a level your rating is calculated at the end based on two factors: Completion, and Finesse. The rankings go D>C>B>A>S for both. You're aiming for S. Completion is based on how much of the dust in the level you actually picked up, and Finesse is based on a combo system in the game. If you either kill an enemy or pick up dust, you'll gain a number on your combo rating, going up for each consecutive dust within a certain amount of time, with the time resetting on pickup. A rather basic combo system. If you get hit, or die, you lose your combo, ruining your chance of getting an 'S' in Finesse. To get two S's for the level, you have to collect all of the dust, kill all the enemies, and do so whilst keeping your combo up throughout. If you get a ""double S"", you have essentially ""beaten"" the level, and I use the term beaten loosley because you will not have come close to the actually good players, and will be given either a Bronze, Silver or Gold key to unlock a different level with. There are also pre-unlocked levels which unlock at the beginning of the game automatically. If you beat a Pre-Unlocked level with an SS rank, you'll be given a bronze key. You can then use that key to unlock a different level, and if you beat a bronze-locked level, you get a silver key, silver levels give gold keys, and after you complete a Gold level you gain a Red key which is used in a hidden area within the main nexus hub world to unlock one of many doors, after all of which have been unlocked you finally get access to some of the hardest custom levels made before Dustforce DX came out which the devs kindly added here to the improved version. There is also a barebones combate system, consisting of light and heavy attacks, as well as a special attack gained after a 100 combo, executed by pressing light+heavy attack buttons simultaneuosly. These light combat mechanics allow you to take on the games many varied enemies. The ""dust"" you're picking up isn't always dust, either. There are 4 zones in the game; Forest, Laboratory, Industrial, and Abandoned. The last two aren't the real names but it works. In Forest, the dust is leaves. Laboratory has slime, industrial has garbage, and abandoned has... well, dust. If any of this sounds even remotely interesting, please google a high level gameplay video ad then contrast to a low level one to understand what I mean about skill being such a massive factor. Overall:Pros:-Amazing sountrack, worth listening to on its own-Momentum based gameplay feels great-High skill ceiling for lots of replayability-Incredibly tight controlls, which are necessary for a game like this-Wonderful art styleCons:-High skill floor, meaning a large barrier to entry-Incredibly difficult; now I love this so I won't dock points but many see it as a con, depends on your preference-Have to manually bind controls on controller, althogh no need for 3rd party appOverall:I would give dustforce a 10/10 score. Now why would I do that if I listed 3 cons? Well because difficulty doesn't matter in a review score, though should still be mentioned in the review itself, and because manuallybinding controls doesnt matter when you remember that everyone has a control preference and letting people figure theirs out instead of teaching them a control system and thus almost ubiquitously forcing them to relearn is a much much better alternative. Definitely buy this game if you're into difficult platformers. If not, sample the soundtrack, potentially give it a buy, and otherwise, move on.			"

												Dustforce is a game about 4 heroic cleaners out to clean up some sort of sentient filth.  Leaves, dust and slime all coat the floors, walls and ceilings of each level and it’s your job to sweep, dust or vacuum it all away.  To do so requires precise, difficult control and levels are designed to be completed with finesse.  The game shines in its difficulty which drives the player to finish each level as quickly and elegantly as possible, striving for an elusive SS Rank.Dustforce is not a game without some fault, however.  The controller support is limited, requiring some menu fidgeting to get it to work and the d-input controls override the keyboard inputs.  The game also doesn’t do a great job of guiding the player or setting a level curve, despite the door and key mechanic for some of the harder levels.  But really, those are minor gripes.Despite its minor flaws, I’ve really been enjoying this game.  The beautiful visuals and vibrant music have quite a grip on me.  The animation uses a lot of fluid animation smears and the the music presents a feeling of adventure without being over the top.  It’s very relaxing, which can be very important when dealing with a particularly difficult run.One of the better mechanics also lies in the replay mechanic.  When looking at the leaderboard, simply click on any of the camera icons (including the one by your own run) to view a replay of that run in its entirety.  This is a cool way to see how your friends compare, how you can improve your own run and what the top players are doing to get such good runs.In the end, this game is fantastic, and somewhat reminiscent of something like N+ or perhaps even Super Meat Boy.  If you’re into that sort of tough platforming, Dustforce is worth your time and money.  And buy the soundtrack edition; it’ll save you a step later. "

												Dustforce is an amazing platformer with some of the most fluid movement mechanics you can get in a video game.Highly recommended if you're looking for a challenging game (although it starts you off easy) with many optimization opportunities!			"

												This is not a game for the light-hearted. I'm being serious - if you want to get a perfect on all of the stages, you are going to need to set aside a significant chunk of time to devote to this. The way your janitor controls also takes some getting used to, you have to stop yourself from pressing the jump button one more time when you get started, and the precise timing may be off-putting. However, the new tutorials in the DX update are vastly better than the old ones, and once everything clicks you realize how d*** brilliant everything is.There are few things more exhilarating than flowing from platform to platform, effortlessly cleaning up all of the trash in your way. There are few things more satisfying than, after many restarts, nailing every jump and pressing every button at exactly the right time. There are few things more rewarding than racking up a 300+ combo and taking out all of the end-level enemies with the press of a button and seeing your janitor jump effortlessly around the screen, turning everything into a cloud of dust in slow motion, then falling to the ground with your newly-cleaned buddies, pumping your janitor's fist triumphantly. As said before, once everything clicks, you'll have a blast.TL;DR: Once you get the hang of this, you will experience one of the best platformers ever to one of the best soundtracks ever.			"

												So incredibly polished, and perfectly styled.  Aesthetically, this game is a masterpiece.  Go for the soundtrack[lifeformed.bandcamp.com] edition too, as the music in Dustforce is absolutely stellar.  Gameplay is very solid as well, although people without a lot of patience need not apply.  The platforming is hardcore, and the later levels are absolutely brutal.Four characters to choose from, each with different strengths, lots of levels to agonize over, and a wonderful, wonderful sense of style.  One of my personal favourites.			"

												This game is clearly way too hardcore for me. Levels are available in 3 basic tiers of difficulty, unlocked by sufficiently besting some levels of the previous tier, and then actually GETTING TO the level entrances in the hub area, which is oftentimes more sadistic than the levels themselves. I have gotten to exactly one of the third tier levels, and couldn't manage to get back to where I was afterwards.At a glance, it's a great concept, you speedrun levels while dealing with all the cleaning hotspots and keeping a combo going from start to finish if you want to S-rank it. In practice, unfortunately, I find myself wrestling with the controls twice as much as the level design. Entirely too often I'm kicking off of a wall when I was attempting to do a double-jump, clinging to the ceiling when I was trying to do a dash-jump, or dealing with the bizarre inertia that makes it impossible to just nudge yourself a half-inch in any direction when trying to set up for some precision platforming or just attempt that double-jump from a little farther away from the wall so I don't do a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wall jump by mistake again.Still recommended, but eh.It does come with a level editor at least.

												Dustforce is a beautiful platformer with a very high skill cap. The premise of the game is to sweep each level while never letting your combo drop; which occurs when you have not swept up any dust after a set period of time. A flawless continuous sweep gives you a 'perfect' rating, which can unlock keys which you can use to enter more difficult levels. This is not necessary to enjoy the game, though, as many levels are available without unlocks and community made levels are plentiful and just as enjoyable. You can complete levels without perfecting them, though this gives you a worse rating and no key. Earning a perfect rating on difficult levels is really a challenge as the mechanics in Dustforce take hours, maybe even days of playtime to perfect. The game contains a leaderboard where you can watch replays of the best times to get a feel for how to perfect a level and different paths to take. Only a small handful of players have perfected every level, and I am not one of them. The challenge does not take away from the game, though, it is still a fantastic game with gorgeous visuals and a calming and beautiful soundtrack that I have listened to for nearly 3 years now. I highly suggest picking up Dustforce if you are a fan of difficult platformers and want a real challenge fit for a perfectionist.  Pros: -Beautiful art style and soundtrack, both go great together. -Difficult but rewarding controls and mechanics. -Tons of levels varying in difficulty. -Map editor and thousands of custom made levels from the community to keep you busy. -Leaderboard with a replay system which helps on more difficult levels. -4 different characters with their own slight differences.  Cons: -Some advanced mechanics are not taught in game and are to be learned via the replay system or fanmade tutorials on youtube. -Multiplayer mode is local only (I have never touched it). -Some of the most difficult levels are possibly too hard and require a lot of time to figure out and perfect (may not be a downside to some).Overall I'd I give it an 8/10. Also I suggest using a controller when playing, though this is personal preference.			"

												Overview: An excellent precision platformer that puts emphasis on fine tuning each run and getting as close to impossibly perfect as possible.This game is designed exceptionally well. Everything feels intentional and like meticulous thought was put into it, this caries over into how you learn to play the game as well. In the Dustforce you progress in an spawling overworld by beating levels, gaining keys and subsequently unlocking harder levels. In reality you progress by obsessing over every fraction of a second you could have done better in order to get higher on the leaderboards. You can watch replays others playthroughs of the levels, which is a great resource for new players and works splendidly within game.You can play as 4 characters with slightly different traits, which really wont matter initially for the casual player but can make all the difference once you are acquainted with the game and aim to shoot hundreths of a second off your speed run.  The controls felt a bit loose (or more floaty) to me persoanlly, having just finished playing several other platformers, but it was easy to adjust to and may have just been me. You have an insane amount of mobility and the levels are designed to show this off, letting you fluidly slide around walls, ceiling floors, and lay down some beatdown on enemies when they show up. The music is mostly mellow and slow and almost seems contrary to the pressure of trying to perfect your run. It does a nice job at keep you calm after several trails on the same level. Local Multiplayer works well and is fun to play, and is a wonderful addition. The animations and style of the game look great, just look at dem screen shots above.			"

												It's really cool to see a platformer that uses action elements not to simply make the game have a fighting aspect, but to add a layer of complexity to platforming.  Every move that you can perform can be used in defense against enemies, but enemies are generally positioned in a way that allow the player to fight them while maintaining momentum through the levels.Difficulty for this game ramps up pretty quick, but the satisfaction of mastering an area or level in this game is super high.  The game is also quick to reset the player after messing up, so the penalty isn't very frustrating.To top it off, the game has an amazing soundtrack.  It complements the style of play very well.  I feel like the soothiness of the music has often made the time spent to master an area or level enjoyable.  I mean, this game gets pretty hard...it could be one of those ""flip the table in frustration"" games, but the environments and soundtrack are so relaxing that it's easy to convince yourself to keep trying.

												This game is good, like really really good. However, my main complain is that the difficulty curve is pretty steep. The game become pretty tough quickly and some levels are so annoyingly hard to even reach, let alone play. However, the game is pretty solid, just needs allot of skill to play. The controls are great, the concept is simple, great platforming but becomes very tough very quickly. Would recommend to people who have time to become very good at the game, not for people who want to play casually like me.			"

												The first few levels you play will feel akward and you will probably not look as cool as you thought you would . Soon though you will get the controls down and be soaring through the maps. It will feel  really good to go through a level flawlessly and you will probably get the craving for more. This game  is easy to learn but hard to master and there will be some levels that will give you trouble. I would recommend this game if you are looking for a 2d platformer to play, and want something that makes you feel good for beating the level in some style. ** CHECK OUT the Humble Bundle now to get this game and some other awesome games for 15 dollars and all the money goes to Doctors Without Borders!**			"

												UPDATE: I've returned to the game to earn its Steam cards, trying the DX release. My impression this time around is more favorable: they seem to have eased the difficulty curve, with a wider variety of levels available at the outset. Maybe I'm just better at it this time around, but the combo system seems more forgiving, too. My overall rating is still ""not recommended for most people,"" but it's definitely been improved since I played before.---I obtained Dustforce as part of a Humble Bundle, and it turned out to be one of the weakest entries of the set. Having enjoyed Super Meat Boy, I thought taking on another challenging speed/flow platformer would be good fun, but Dustforce didn't measure up.In premise, Dustforce seemed like a lot of fun. Ninja janitors! Fighting-game style uppercuts and kicks, used to navigate hazards and literally clean house! Some lovely sprite work and a fantastic soundtrack enticed me to give it a go.Unfortunately, Dustforce turns out to be one of those games where only the hardest of the hard core need apply, and no lesser player has any hope of wringing some entertainment from this sharp, unforgiving stone of a title. Unless you master the moves immediately (perhaps by some years' experience playing Street Fighter on the competitive scene?), you will fail constantly, progressing to the end of even the earliest levels only by determination and brute repetition. That in and of itself is not irredeemable--that's part and parcel of SMB's shtick, after all. However, the insult to injury is that speedrunning is mandatory. You cannot barely squeak out a level completion and advance in the game; you *must* achieve a ranking score in speed and thoroughness in order to earn keys to open additional levels. If you don't, well, enjoy replaying the first world a lot, because that's all you'll get to see.There is something to be said for defying the predominant game design pattern of ""if you just play long enough, no matter your skill, you will win."" And no doubt a truly elite button-pusher would revel in it here. But if you don't consider yourself such a chest-thumping master, you would do well to give this game a pass.			"

Dustforce DX Review This is my personal view on the game, and though you may disagree with some of the statements I make I stand with them nonetheless.Game was purchased in the Humble Indie Game bundle.Dustforce DX is platformer game like many other platformer games, with the primary objective of the game being to gain the fastest possible time accompanied by style and completion of a level as possible. It has a large player base, many levels to choose from, a level editor and plenty of UGC. Here's a list of pros and cons I've compiled which I felt summarise the game:ProsTidy graphics that are pleasing to the eye.OST's that can be enjoyable to listen to.A plethera of levels to choose from with varying levels of difficulty for the player.Solid gameplay mechanics that aid the game in differing from other generic platformers.Full gamepad support (Which I also highly recommend if you choose to buy this game).With those positives, you may wonder what made me not recommend this game. Well, here's the list of cons that detracted from the game, mostly personal preference:ConsSomewhat repetitive gameplay, as of many generic platformers. Gets exceedingly boring over extended periods of playtime, I had to resort to 15 minutes each session.Can feel extremely unrewarding at times, given the 'speedrun' feel to the game. Completing a section of a level you have been stuck on for a while does not mean success, but rather spending time trying to complete levels decreases your final score, which leads onto the next point.Can grind to a halt at certain parts of gameplay. By this, I mean some of the early levels can be gruelling and seem out of place, as early users as myself may find certain parts of a level too difficult to proceed on, meaning the rest of the level goes to waste as one part of the level cannot be completed. Ties in as hard parts of levels that take multiple tries to complete can be pointless in the end to complete.Speed problems. Not running speed, such as lag, but rather play speed. The game at times can feel sluggish, and over long stretches of rock can feel slow. The game can also lose momentum when you make a minor slip and parts of the level such as loops are impossible to make, ergo reducing your final score and sometimes making you backtrack.No threats. This one being more personal preference than the others, but every enemy I've encountered in the game so far (Around 20-25 levels in) has posed no threat, and at the most has only knocked me over for me to only recover again within a matter of a second. This makes levels seem somewhat bland, as the only enemy is the level itself.Again, somewhat more personal, the dash-jump mechanic is frustrating to carry out. The mechanic intends that you dash then jump on solid ground to jump a long distance without the need for a run-up, although for many times I have found in levels it is intended to be used I cannot carry out the dash-jump. This, for me, was mostly experienced on the Advanced Training level, where the game does not tell you HOW to dash-jump and the level is also seemingly harder than the previous two tutorials by far.For the points listed above, I cannot recommend this game. This game by no means is a bad game, as can provide some entertaining gameplay at points and is well made, but due to the way it plays, I would not recommend this game to a friend.Overall rating: 6/10TL;DR: Well made but frustrating to play at points and can be rather generic.

												Nice stylized graphics, amazing OST. If you like time trial games, this game is for you. It has an actual legitimate leaderboard (with viewable replays), and I haven't seen any cheating on it.The game's system is very well conceived, staying simple enough for a novice to have fun, but has enough depth for an advanced player to distance themselves from the rest. There are 4 characters you can use, each one having slightly different attributes.This game can get really difficult if you're trying for SS rankings, or competing for top times in the leaderboards. If you're not into competing for times or going for 100% completion, then the game becomes considerably less difficult as you can utilize checkpoints in stages and retry from them as many times as you like.

												The best flow of any platformer I've played; prefers efficiency and eloquency over survival. The goal is to get to the end of a level with the highest score and/or time, instead of just trying to get there at all. Has a calm soundtrack to keep you from getting frustrated.I love this game and everything about it, and it's the best platformer I've played.			"

												Dustforce is a calming game. The game isn't labelled difficult for nothing, but the game is probably a very different tone than most you'd find under the category. Between the calming visuals and the serene soundtrack, I never really got that frustrated like I would in other difficult platformers: instead I got determined.That's part of the magic of Dustforce. It's one of those games that really lets you take the game at your own pace, do levels how you see fit. There's no plot or story which allows you to explore whichever unlocked door you want to first.It's a very easy game to get into, with challenge ramping and testing you throughout. The entire game is essentially a tutorial. Unlike similar describable games though, there is an endgame there.Enter the community. You can watch the top run that anyone has done in the game via the replay system. You can see how any of your friends tackled the level. You can see the guy who shaved a few frames off your time and see what he did differently. Anyone you meet who plays this game extensively is also incredibly friendly and just welcoming new faces to the game. It's got to have one of the best video game communities I've ever been bare to witness. So pick it up, try it out, see if it's your cup of tea. You might be surprised how fun cleaning can be, and how far you can take it.			"

												Traditional platforming has never felt so graceful. If I had to sum up dustforce in one word it would be “Understated.” Everything from the stylized visual aesthetic, to the almost silhouette character sprites, the animations, enemies and even the level design all hold themselves with such dignity. The small flashes of flare that you get, when performing your special ability and the slow motion finishing move at the end of each level all give you a sense of “Yeah, I just did that, whatever.” As you calmly walk off from your amazing display of platforming prowess without even looking back.Mechanics wise, dustforce is a great example of giving the player a single minded goal, and the tools to get there. I forgot where I read it and i hope they don't mind the unattributed quote but it sums up so perfectly the mentality I draw from the game. “Dustforce is not content to let you be content with yourself.” Again apologies for probably butchering the original quote but it is so true.Dustforce has a tiered level structure where you unlock keys to higher tiered levels by completing previous ones to a certain proficiency. While simply completing the level from start to finish may be enough at the start to work towards a few keys and level, you will eventually need to break past your preconceived limits. This system of partial completion still progressing the player is great for giving the player control over their own difficulty curve and doesn’t fall into the pit of so many other challenging platformers where you get stuck on a single level and cannot progress.Another thing it does great is support the players journey of self improvement without being overbearing. After completing any particular level you are given access to the high scores from the community. But where other games may stop there dustforce then records the exact run of that player so that you can view it whenever you want in its entirety. I cannot tell you the amount of times I was stuck on certain levels but then was able to completely change my approach after seeing a “pro” do it in front of my eyes.But no game is perfect and Dustforce is no exception. The physics and movement in the game is very momentum based. If you are unable to continue your exact series of boosts and ramp launches you will find your experience rather jerky. When it works it makes speed runs a visually awe inspiring art, but when it doesn't you find yourself spamming jumps off walls at odd angle into spike pits or off cliffs.I would recommend this game to anyone that loves tried and tested platforming mechanics with a stylish coat of paint and some really nice quality of life features. And to anyone that loves the feeling of becoming one with your controller, eye's glazed, as you become one with the game and skirt even the most precarious platform dungeons with grace and ease. "

												Dustforce is one of the best games I've played in the 2D platformer category.The controls are very tight and well made, having the possibility to do everything from the beginning - your skills progression solely depend on your increasing understanding and ability to control your janitor. If you're into a whole lot of challenge, this game can provide it. (and if you're easily frustrated by absurd difficulty, which exists in the later part of this game - consider avoiding the game).The graphics are beautiful, atmospheric and give each level-set a defined feel and flow.The soundtrack is a bit too relaxed sometimes for my taste, but overall really great.I am close to - but have not finished the game yet and played mostly the provided levels, but I know there are plenty of rich community levels, besides the base content.So far it has been a great challenge a lot of fun - I highly recommend this game. (and consequently also look forward to Hitbox Team's Spire).			"

												Dustforce is a wonderful little platformer. It's extremely hard, at least when you get to the later levels, but the earlier ones are perfectly designed and super fun, and pushing against your records for time is enjoyable by itself, without necessarily beating all the levels. I think the best part about the game is how tightly designed it is, in terms of the controls and the interface, and the leaderboard system. This could have very easily been an underwhelming game if it was just a series of levels with nothing to encourage you to beat your score or watch other people's runs. If the idea of a time trial 2d platformer sounds appealing to you, you should really get this game.			"

I don't mind diffcult games - that is not it. Take Super Hexagon for example, which is super difficult, but controls and gameplay are great. Dustforce on the other hand, I find mostly annoying, because you have to be extremely accurate, which the controls of the game aren't particularily good for, or you just won't make it past certain obstacles.

												When I first found out about the crew of Dustforce and their follies in amateur game development, I became very anxious to play this game and to support them. However, playing the actual game has shown me that good intentions do not necessarily translate into a full experience.I think that Dustforce's biggest problem is how it defines 'skill' and 'difficulty'. Dustforce has very little in the way of rewarding a player, only giving out keys which are used to unlock a handful of harder levels. When most of the game's content is unlocked from the start, the player's only remaining motivation is the scoreboard. When one takes a cursory glance at said scoreboard, one notices very long strings of players who complete the level in virtually the same amount of time, give or take a fraction of a second. Not only that, but the requirement of sweeping all dust in a level for a perfect score causes every level, regardless of size, to develop a 'one true path' that sacrifices exploration and player experience for the sake of a higher score. This makes the game extremely tedious to play, boiling itself down to memorization of a level and restarting the level at the slightest mishap.I'm aware that the game is designed with the speedrunning community in mind, but one reason as to why speedrunning is so highly valued in those circles is the fact that speedrunners interpret a game in a different manner than the developers, and play it at a much faster speed than intended, entertaining others who are only familiar with a more down-to-earth means of beating the game. Meanwhile, Dustforce's design mentality is rigidly geared towards beating the levels as fast as possible, causing the practice of speedrunning to be rendered pedestrian, and therefore moot. Aside from the core gameplay, which is admittedly quite interesting despite its flawed implementation, there is honestly not much else to say about Dustforce. I did like how the game's various sprites were traditionally animated, but the artstyle itself is so minimalistic that the subtlties and quirks that normally come with such techniques are lost. The music on its own is good, but not exciting or emotional, causing it to simply blend into the background, when music should enhance the player's experience by being memorable or unique.When looking at Hitbox Team's upcoming Spire, I'm glad to see that the team is taking more consideration to the skill of the individual and motivating the individual to get better in order to progress further. Hopefully, it'll make for a more rewarding and engaging experience than Dustforce, which, in my opinion, feels like more of a chore than actual dusting.			"

												Pros: Absolutely gorgeous sound track, addicting gameplay, many creative levels that require unique and complicated platforming mechanics.Cons: Absolute worst platformer game controls I have ever played on steam. The animations look cool, but they induce a huge latency that should not be present in a competitive timed platformer. Difficulty in a platformer should come from the complicated mechanics within the level (which this game ALMOST achieves). Difficulty should not come from the ability of the user to overcome ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls. "

												TLDR; Supermeatboy ftw.I have played a few more hours than shows here.  Not that many more though... I really love the idea of this game. I wish I would like it. In the end it comes down mostly to control responsiveness.Even the simplest jumps feel hard to accomplish, movement feels jerky and if you miss a wallrun edge by a pixel the outcome is completely different and unexpected. I guess you can get used to it and ""get good"", but in this day and age there are so many games that do this right and feel natural, responsive and tight from the get-go while still having a crazy high skill ceiling. Supermeatboy: I'm looking at you and blowing a kiss.Because of this little mistakes completely ruin your runs. Maybe it's by design, but I don't like it. I feel little mistakes should screw you a little and big mistakes screw you a lot. Controller support exists (I play using an xbox360 controller), but it still feels funny. Some commands register on soft presses while others require full presses...Ah and the game's pacing: While it demands big apm spikes there's more focus on precision and routing than hectic speed. So it feels weird: sluggish, complex and puzzling, kinda like that weirdly chosen soothing new age soundtrack. Few games can make me yawn and get frustrated at the same time.			"

												I really tried to love this game but a♥♥♥♥♥♥control scheme on top of unforgiving gameplay just ruins it. Sure, it's your fault the first few times you're just that tiny bit over the edge and you can't use your double jump. But any smart game developer would make it so that the game would give you a new double jump if this happened. Not only that but the special attack is bound to the light and heavy attack keys pushed together at the same time. This would be fine if it worked. Halp the time you'll do a normal attack and lose that combo you've been running. So, in all, a huge timewaster designed by a  company that probably haven't even played the game.			"

												Dustforce is an interesting little side-scrolling platformer where you play as one of four (approximately equal) characters to literally clean up various levels. To me, this game is a lot like Sonic the Hedgehog with smaller levels and more specific goals. All you really need to do is get to the end of the level and clean the 'boss'. However, to progress you need to meet certain goals: % of the level cleaned and point value, which you get by maintaining a combo for as long as possible.The graphics are interesting but nothing terribly special- I think it could be best described as artistically minimal. The audio is there, but neither good nor bad. The story... well, a game like this doesn't really need much of a story.Mechanically the game is pretty solid. There are times when it feels like the controls aren't as tight as they could be, and the objective-based advancement means you find yourself doing many iterations of the same frustrating levels. The game does have controller support, but you'll have to do a lot of rigging to make it work right.Its an interesting challenge game, but lacks a certain something. It doesn't make it bad, just... not something I play at for long periods. This indie title is still worth playing though, so consider picking it up if it happens to be on sale.If you found this review useful, please have a look at my other reviews.[/url] "

												The game looked like an interesting platformer and I really wanted to try it but it just failed to meet expectations.There is something about controls that it feels like a chore, like I'm struggling with a basic controls. Even when my character did all those ninja moves it just didn't feel like a consequence of my actions. I played for a short while but it was just not satisfying nor enjoyable experience. Also I don't know if there is any plot later on but from these few levels I played it just looks like a loooooong series of challenge rooms. Nothing to keep me interested.			"

												Pro:1. Great soundtrack.2. Clean, simplistic graphics.Cons:1. Controller support is bad, as game was seemingly designed with keyboard controls in mind. You need to literally press UP instead of slightly UP+LEFT or UP+RIGHT which usually is the result of a fluid D-Pad motion and as one has come to expect from 2D platformers.2. There's a deliberate fuzziness to the controls and delay between inputs and response on screen.If you're coming from SMB and alike and are expecting a challenging platformer with tight controls and actual progress with every new attempt, look somewhere else.

Posted: June 4, 2015
												I really tried to like this game. But after about four hours of play time and not one minute of fun I gave up on this game. Here are the reasons for this.Instead of moving smoothly you kind of ""trigger"" fixed movement schemes (e.g. pressing right ones makes about two or three steps to the right). Because of this your input does not always have an effect on the movement. This means that precise timing and reactions are less important than pure mezmorizing and in the worst cases playing felt more like a long boring quick time event. Personally I can't stand QTE's.In order to progress you have to collect every single piece (!) of dust in a level. To me this feels like a goal that should clearly be optional. Suppose some Mario game that says: ""Oh, you didn't collect every coin in the level. Go back to the beginning."" Another problem is that this completely breaks the flow of the gameplay. So instead of going for a quick smooth run you turn around and do backtracking to collect the last pieces of dust. In most levels this acutally seems to be what the level-designers intended.In order to progress to must also make sure that your combo-chain does not break, whichs happen if you didn't collect dust for some time. I think this is supposed to force the player to make a ""smooth"" run, but it doesn't. The problem is that usually there is dust in so many places that messing it up first try and clumsily turning around is a valid option. I really don't understand what the developers were going for with this. Why is going through a level fast not rewarded in a game that (I think) is basically designed to be a speedrunner-heaven. Also it should be way better indicated when the combo-chain breaks.Another minor complaint is that the tutorial just does not give you enough information to play the game. You have to figure out  the details of the gameplay-mechanics yourself, it is never explained what the finesse-ranking is based on and neither does the game explain that you actually need double-S ranking in order to unlock all levels (which is by the way stupid as (insert insulting word here) anyway).

												Keyboard controls require exact precise movements to make jumps.  There's a lot of ""momentum"" movements, so it may feel floaty, but that's part of the game mechanic.  I thought I was pretty good at platformers, but this game shamed me.Honestly, it's a pretty good platformer, however I don't think the average gamer would enjoy it, so this is a ""No"" unless you are a platforming expert.

												There is nothing bad to say about this game. Nothing.The soundtrack is a unique, atmospheric montage of skillfully crafted musical sounds. The gameplay is flawless and exciting, and can be quite the challenge to those who think they've seen all the game has to offer! With an intricate overworld, gorgeous scenery, and riveting gameplay, this is a must-have game for anyone who enjoys platformers or video games in general.There are hidden spots in every level where you can sit and enjoy the scenery for as long as you like, all while relaxing to the fabulous soundtrack. There are hidden secrets which add to the game's depth as you struggle to find at least one in every level of every one of the four worlds. For an indie game, it does everything right.The controls are responsive and they will not miss an input unless you put in a dash while you're in the air (as that won't happen on any game anyways). Each level is better than the last, and there's a Tome of Levels for you to visit your favorites if you choose not to run through the overworld to get to it. Please play it with a controller, as keyboard takes getting used to.All in all, this game is wonderful. For me personally not worth 10 bucks or whatever it goes for, but you can get it every few months in a bundle for a dollar with some other games, so there's always that. "

												It's a shame. I really enjoyed watching speedruns of Dustforce. I had high hopes that I'd be able to do the same stunts that several of the top players displayed in various playthroughs. Unfortunately, this game has ultimately taught me the difference between watching videos of Dustforce and physically playing Dustforce.+Pros: Beautiful music (very relaxing!) and art. Fun to watch. Competitive for the speedrunning community. High replay value*-Cons: Stiff controls, hard to master even after brushing and practicing the tutorial several times, confusing hub world, definitely not worth the $9.99 price tag.Summary:While the gameplay looks impressive, the controls are extremely stiff and difficult to master (actions like jumping are delayed once the button is pressed, not immediate). After the tutorial, you'll have to perform the actions you just learned to enter a door that leads to a hub world; this took me a bunch of tries (I just wanted to play the game already!). There's no sense of direction in this hub world; I found myself entering harder levels earlier just because I was wandering around aimlessly. Without a sense of direction (especially on a first playthrough), casual players will find the difficulty going all over the place rather than easier--->harder levels. With an insanely steep learning curve and a non-linear flow of gameplay, I don't feel enticed to explore this game further after 5+ hours of trying to work with the game's mechanics.*Because Dustforce drives players to complete levels as fast as possible, much of the core gameplay revolves around beating your personal best time. I've had some experience with speedrunning games and personally, I can't find enjoyment from trying to beat my times if I cannot enjoy the controls and core mechanics of the game first. Dustforce isn't something I can recommend to anyone unless they find entertainment in learning every inch of mechanic possible in this game through countless repitition and muscle memory			"

												Before you read my review, keep in mind I've played, like, a few minutes of this game. All of this is first impression stuff.What I like:• The soundtrack is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ GORGEOUS (I even discovered this game because of the soundtrack, Lifeformed is awesome)• The vector-like graphics are really niceWhat I dislike:• Control kinda sucks, it feels inaccurate and somewhat floaty, and doing the tricks like walljumps isn't easy or that intuitive. It isn't terrible, but it isn't great either...• It feels all... zoomed in... like a 3D game where the FOV is jacked down to like 30So concludes my first-glance review. To be honest, I'll probably never play this again. If my review is inaccurate, it's because I've barely started. It doesn't help that I went into this game expecting the quality of Super Meat Boy or World of Goo (because I bought this game in a Humble Bundle with those two also in the bundle).			"

												I don't like Dustforce, and I can't really put my finger on why, though I have my suspicions. Let's start with all the things this game does right, though:-Cool theme/graphical style-Fun characters (all functionally identical, but visually distinct)-Pleasant musicSo what's wrong with Dustforce? It's hard to put into words, as the vocabulary for platform video game reviewing is still in its infancy and words like ""floaty"", ""mushy"", ""heavy"", ""satisfying"" and so on are all very subjective. If I was forced to put it into words, I'd say that your character is too heavy, yet doesn't have enough inertia - it takes a while to get up to speed, and it's very easy to lose that momentum with the way that levels are designed. It's fairly fluid when you play perfectly, but it falls apart in the hands of an inexpert player. What else?The overworld is directionless and confusing. There are no (threatening) enemies, so this is purely platforming for the sake of platforming. Rarely are you directly challenged - the game is clearly designed for speedrun enthusiasts.Here in the modern era of gaming, you have tons of options if you're looking to run and jump on some platforms. If I were you, I'd be cautious about this one. Check out Super Meat Boy instead.			"

												I'm sorry. This is still a pretty cool game. It just failed to catch my attention, and it didn't make me want to play more.That's why I stopped playing at 24 minutes.It's......kinda boring.There's no actual goal, and really, the only thing you're doing is cleaning up dust as if your OCD tells you to.Pros: Long, interesting game. Difficult.Cons: Kinda boring, Weird objective, A bit of a five minute wonder, really. "

												Truly this is a game where you can enjoy the most ambient gameplay ever....while going nuts about beating the highest ranked times and wondering just where your day went to afterwards.Its addictive and fun and a joy to pick up and play whenever you want...just be careful getting obsessed with it.

												""Cleaning up dust wasn't as much fun as I thought it'd be."" 5/10I never thought I'd see the day where I wanted to play a game that revolved around cleaning up dust particles, but nevertheless, here we are. They say never judge a book by it's cover. Well, never judge a video game by it's screenshots. For this game appeared to have it all, but managed to fall short. Let me start out by saying that I loved the art style though, along with the soundtrack. In fact, the soundtrack is probably the best part about 'Dustforce' and is exactly what you want in a platformer. As for the controls, they are nowhere near as bad as some of the people on here make them out to be, and personally I found them to be quite good. The only thing that stinks is how they make you assign the controller buttons yourself, as opposed to just having them preset for you. I wouldn't even dream of using a keyboard to play this game. As you may already know, this game was made with speedrunning in mind. Speedrunning is something I enjoy watching, but not performing, and had I known that beforehand, I would have skipped this game entirely. I mean, who makes a game specifically tailored for speedruns? Getting to the end of a level as quickly as possible? Where's the fun in that? No, I like to take my time, look around, really take in my surroundings. And besides, isn't the whole fun in speedrunning, coming up with the fastest method on your own? It just doesn't make much sense if you ask me. Aside from that, there's pretty much nothing else to do in this game but run from door to door playing level after level for the best time. No bosses, no enemies, just jumping from one platform to another, climbing wall after wall, sweeping up that dirty dust. There just doesn't feel like much of a reason to continue playing 'Dustforce' after an hour or two, unless you care about posting the highest scores for all to see. Which is basically where 99% of the incentive to continue playing comes from; the highest possible score. On the other hand, I can definitely see how people enjoy playing this game. Like I said, the soundtrack is great, the art style although simplistic, works quite well, and the controls are pretty good.			"

												If you're a fan of ninja-styled mechanics in platformers, I would say to ignore this title. There isn't any real way to maintain speed, the keyboard assignment is terrible, and the jumps and movement in the game seem to be too consistent. That's right. TOO consistent.Think games like Mario Bros. or N+, where you can just tap a jump or movement key and only move a small amount.This game doesn't follow that at all, at least on keyboard controls.While playing, I found a set of ledges with a gap just big enough for the character to fall between, but for some reason, the game will still ""jump"" you from one platform to the next even while trying to walk and fall between them. Again, there is no small movement in the game. In trying to make a time-based fluid movement, they have done away with sensitivity, making technical parts of levels more difficult than they should be.			"

												Personally, i bought this game just because of the music, i really like 2d platformers, but this one is not very good. EDIT: What i meant by mechanical problems were that, the walls and ceiling are feels too sticky, the gravity is inconsistent by suddenly falling after the peak of the jump, dashing is not really dashing when is just does is reset direction and default horizontal velocity.And before writing a long review i found some others that already noticed or have some interesting points, check them out if they haven't changed steam id:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198060328335/recommended/65300/http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198009304313/recommended/65300/http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994480308/recommended/65300/3 of 9 people found this review helpful, which means that 6 of 9 people can't accept criticism.

There, I was given feedback on what I should try and do differently, and the rules stayed the same throughout the game.

												This game helped me find out I'm an idiot, cause how else can I explain the fact that it's been an hour and I'm still struggling to finish the tutorial. Yeah, I get it, it's meant to be challenging, difficulty is its main concept, it's a ""precision"" platformer, but come on, the controls are bad as **** when using a menial keyboard. I love indie games, but some of them are way too pretentious to deserve all the appreciation they sometimes get for free.Thank God at least it comes with trading cards. Also the soundtrack seemed pretty nice, at least during the tutorial part, cause getting any further is clearly not something I'll get to do.Or maybe the tutorial is ****ed up?!Anyway, let the downvoting begin, but I couldn't possibly ever recommend this game. If you pretend on being focused on difficulty, provide some damn proper controls first!			"

												Was excited to try the game, and then thurougly let down. It is an interesting (albeit kinda boring) idea you just sweep everything up. There is not story whatsoever (meh). Music seems fine. Then the problems happen. The game requires all these tricky movements and long fluid combos, but the controls and mechanics and super finnicky, inconsistent and dont work half the time. Sometimes I will be able to jump after a wall-run, while other times I won't. Sometimes I will only get a single jump and sometimes I will get a double jump. It seems stupid to me you can't double jump, wall run, and double jump again. The wall running and ceiling running is the worst crime. Sometimes I will be able to run up a wall, and other times I will hold against it and my gun will just run a tiny bit or won't even start a wallrun. One part to get to a new area my guy runs up and then on the ceiling, then just stops for no reason. I try to jump to the next area and hold over because the ledge is right there, but he just won't react to any buttons and falls down. This makes no sense. Sometimes you can run on the ceiling and then around on to the wall, and other times it won't. It just seems the people want to game to be more fluid, but the controls aren't consistent enough. The movements are also floaty and you will try to jump next to something and overshoot it or you will try to double jump next to a wall and instead it will make you run up it. Same goes with hitting, which you can hit up, but at and angle. Countless times I would be next to a guy and hit, only to go through him because I was TOO CLOSE and I wasn't at the perfect spot where the end of my broom ended exactly on his body, but thats like saying you can't hit someone with a sword because they aren't at the tip......I still hit him with the rest of my broom it should count. Very questionable hit recognition. Then there is the level design. Instead of making the levels easy to get to, like the level book, you can only look at them and replay unlocked ones, which seems dumb, because I'd rather be able to play the ones I haven't yet. Instead there is this open map with tons of different platforms and branching paths, and I am supposed to find every unlockable level by exploring....what this does is make me wonder if I have missed levels, and the only way to find out is to backtrack and try to make sense of things. Why not have the levels you created that you want people to play accessible, not in a convoluted area where people can easily miss them. Then there are levels and are like impossible to get it. I went through and played all the levels that seemed accessible and apparent how to get to them, and I know there are more but have no clue how to get to them, and then other parts I am wondering if there are other ways to get to. This shouldn't be that way this early to leave this many levels on the table like that. I don't understand why they would add the monotony of walking from door to door and retracing steps and trying to figure out how to get to this impossible looking spot, just to play the levels of a platformer, it seems counterintuitive to me. Why waste time with boring things when we just want to get to the good parts.Also they say controller support, but it doesn't automatically detect it, and you have to manually reset all of the buttons, and even then you can't use just the controller, because you can't program start to pause or use the controller on the menus very well....for a platformer thats a mistake by them.And i know there are people on here that are tryhards that are like ""I don't have any of these problems"" and ""you're just bad"" but the fact is I'm not, I've played tons of platformers. I recently played a game called freedom fall that had tight controls and I had no problems with. The people that I mentioned above that will say those things, put like 70 hours into the game, and it shouldn't take that long to try and get consistency out of movement controls, they shouldn't take that much repetition and effort to figure them out, they should be obvious. I have played other games that do wall-running, air juggling, and sliding, better than this. Also there is the keys and the scores. I mentioned in my ""AAAAA for awesome"" that scores are cool for the tryhards like the ones that want to SS everything and spend 20 hours on 20 levels, but you shouldn't force that. I shouldn't have to get certain preset scores to unlock more levels by getting keys based on my score. Just let me play the levels you created. I do like how they included level editor, multiplayer, and the community maps, although those are just a lot of dumb ones with all spikes created by tryhards that want you to be perfect with moves and have spent 60 hours like them, so I wasn't impressed with some of the creations. 4.5/10.

												This game is just terrible when it comes to learning how to play it. If you can learn to play it, then I imagine ti would be an awesome game.The learning curve. You look at hard platform games like super meat boy or electronic super joy, these are hard games. But the learning curves are pretty good.  But this game just lacks that entirely.Before the ""DX"" update, it was impossible to ""get into the game"" without already having knowledge of it. In the new DX update, things are easier, but they are still not perfect. I mean, for goodness sake, in order to even reach the 3rd tutorial, you seem to require the knowldge that is taught to you in that 3rd tutorial. (i.e. dash-jumping) It is very badly designed.Having not been able to play them, I can't speak for the design of the later levels.The control scheme for this game is impossible to use. In order to set it up to use a controller, you need to set up each button manually. And if you do set it up with a controller, it is impossible to switch back to keyboard without again manually resetting each button, via your controller. And god help you if you can't connect your controller again to do this. Also, I can't seem to figure out why the menu can't be opened by the controller. It can only be opened by pressing Esc on the keyboard.Now, as for the music and art in this game, it looks really good.  Kudos to the dev team for that. The music is very calming (which is helpful in alleviating frustration), and the art style is simplistic, but avoids feeling ""flat"".To summarize, I really think this game is lacking a lot in the way of easing new players in. It is just impossible to learn how to play it. Even with help from snipppets of conversations in the forums, it just feels like it's missing something. That, or I am the one missing something here.[Incidentally, if anyone knows what it is that i'm missing, please tell me, because I really want to be able to play this game].			"

												Sorry, I really wanted to like this and came back to it several times but...It feels good when you get in the flow, but that's too hard to do. I wish steam had a neutral recommendation because I'd give it to this game, but it doesn't so I have to give it a negative one.I know people are going to write some dumb ""lol ur just bad git gud lolol"" comments. The problem is I played for 2 hours and I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong. The double-jumping (or triple jumping with the purple character) seemed to have some nebulous rules governing it that I simply couldn't explain. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. I played around with it trying to figure out how it works, and it seemed random to me. Apparently it just has no leniency when jumping off of ledges and my initial jumps were counting as air jumps. This is just weird design, especially for a game that emphasizes speed. I can't think of another platformer that's so strict. That leniency is necessary because characters take up a 2D space on screen. You can't just pick any point beneath Mario and say ""yeah if he hangs that far off the platform he falls"" like these devs seem to have done. I've played hard games before, including From's 3D Dot Game Heroes which was downright cruel and way harder than their Souls series', but I didn't have to google the issue and forget 20 years of game experience to ""git gud."" If I have to google your core game mechanics, you did a poor jobThe level progression is also ridiculous and keeps you from playing all of the bronze levels if you don't *perfect* all of the basic ones, so you're kinda screwed if you can't do that			"

												As a mouse heavy gamer (RTS, FPS, point n' click) I should not have picked this game up. For me it's really hard to understand and even harder to play considering the complete lack of finger coordination I have with the keyboard. If you're a heavy mouse gamer, I do not suggest picking this game up.BUT if you're an inbetweener (MOBA) or a keyboard heavy gamer (twitch Platformer, Racing, MMORPG) you should probably pick this game up as I have heard from very many people that are keyboard or inbetween that it's a great game. If you're mouse heavy, I suggest spending your money on Reciever instead.			"

												I've really tried to like this game over the past 5 or so years I've owned it. I love the concept, but I really can't say I enjoy the 'feel' of the game. It has some weird momentum-based physics that give it a sort of 'floaty' feel to it. A lot of people will call this a precision-based platformer. I would call it pretentious. The devs did well to implement a series of tutorials, as they thought the game was too hard for many. However, there are still a ton of hidden mechanics that aren't explicitly taught to the player, so it's often confusing once you've completed a certain number of levels on where to head next. Until you know what's possible in the context of the game, it's really off-putting. I shouldn't have to go to forums and YouTube to determine that there are many completely obtuse things hidden in the game's mechanics in order to proceed. Additionally, there are numerous bugs this game has, such as the game deciding it will automatically use up your double jump if you are too close to an edge. Mr Peck on YouTube has these documented, if you want some evidence of them. Tons of optimization problems, such as crashing if you alt+tab out of the window and simply setting up a controller is a nightmare if you want to switch between keyboard and gamepad; buttons across both is frustrating. They should have just used a 'set all buttons' command and let the player sequentially determine the mappings.If I were looking for a game in this genre, it'd be Wings of Vi over this - feels way better.

												Game looks nice, not much into platformers but there a re a few I like provided they work right,The same sequence of maneuvers will not consistently produce the same results in this game, making the game frustrating, and the player's progression through the level isn't nearly as fun or precise as it should be in a platofmer. It seems very very hit and miss even if you KNOW what to do and press the right controls and combos. It's a very hard on the fingers game and seems to not respond correctly, as most of the negative complaints revolve around this issue. Looks nice, but controls are whacked in that they do not respond as they should, when they should, making it frustating as opposed to challenging.			"

												first, i d like to state that i really love platformers, i can fairly say its my favourite genre and i want to give this game a neutral review though it didnt work out for my taste.lets get the facts straight, this game is a hardcore game with satisfyingly precise controls. its not like that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game rush bros with unresponsive controls. the gameplay is really really tight.yet, i find it hard to get into the game. yes they have a strange concept of dustman/cleaners mopping/dusting floor in high speed. but the atmosphere fails to suck you into that beatiful gameplay. artstyle, music and gameplay dont blend.you listen to that slow paced depressing music while you struggle with the pace and precision of the game.  its like putting a small economy engine into a sports car, game cant even pull its own weight. sadly.

												I actually found myself rather excited to see Steam Trading Cards brought to Dustforce so late into it’s life. They gave me a good reason to go sink a few more hours into game when I don’t know that I would have played it again out of my own interest. I was absolutely dreadful at the game but the art, music, world and just the overall premise of the title really charmed me. I personally would have never bought Dustforce had it not been part of a bundle, but everything about the game was well done and lovingly put together and it really showed.Sadly, something has changed. I booted the game back up to sweep some leaves and collect some cards and all of the mechanics are just broken. The controls are floaty and imprecise, the character seems to have a bizarre response time and beyond the fact that I openly admit I was dreadful at the game upon it’s release, whatever updates that have been put in place since then have made it completely unplayable. It’s truly a shame, but I can no longer say I recommend Dustforce.			"

												Lazy programmers who don't know nothing about design principles and usability have created a game that takes a few minutes of your life to set up controls on a xbox controller.

However, I feel it is needlessly difficult. Other wize it is a fun game. It comes down to how invested you want to be in a game. Personally, I will never finish it. There isn't enough incentive to do so story wize. Maybe it will be worth watching on youtube..... Trying to be nice although still controller smashing angry at this game.			"

Even ""I Wanna Be the Guy"" had some charm to it. How do you take a controller breaker kind of game and make it so flavorless?Apparently some people are really good at the game. Maybe get a controller and try a demo and if it clicks buy it. Everyone else should probably stay away.			"

												Dustforce is a relentlessly unforgiving platformer, even moreso than Super Meat Boy. In most platformers, there are usually a few different ways to approach problems. In Dustforce, however, you are forced into a single kind of ""perfect run"" to progress normally through the game. You can complete stages without these perfect runs, but by doing so, you lock yourself out of so many stages. Perfection is demanded of you in this game.I'm the kind of person that really enjoys a challenge, but the level of timing, reaction, knowledge, and control demanded of the player is so insane that I made it about 75% of the game before finally stopping to retain my sanity. When you can pull off what it demanded, it is an amazing feeling. But sometimes the game feels incredibly inconsistent, and I know that's only because the timing on everything in this game is on a hair-trigger. I find it really hard to recommend this game except to anyone who is masochistic about challenging games. I did actually really enjoy it myself (I am one of those people), but I also know this is not the kind of game that almost anyone else would be able to enjoy the way I was able to.3 out of 5 foxes.

												This is a game that does so many things right, but yet so many things feel wrong too :/ First, there is this funky air physics where you stay suspended for some time, then drop like a brick, timing is really hard with this kind of twisted movement. Also, the character goes in directions you never wanted it to when wall or ceiling-riding...So yeah the game handles not so great, but a game like this should handle like a freaking formula 1, especially as the levels in this game are freaking 24hours Le Mans long and you must not do any error while playing one session or else you won't unlock levels.

												For its length and number of different worlds and characters available, Dustforce offers almost no variety at all. Worlds are only thematic variations, repeating the same kind of level structure over and over with no unique mechanics between them, while the characters themselves all play pretty much the same, with some minor tweaks from one character to another (with some of the more subtle changes not even being hinted in-game).If that wasn't enough, the game demands ""perfect"" double-S scores for players to be able to make standard progress. Scores that in any other game would exist only as a side challenge to those who truly want to spend their times mastering it. Here, you'll have to clear every single stage flawlessly if you ever hope to see those final levels, and there are MANY stages to be mastered — enough to make one feel like the game overstayed its welcome after only a few hours.Bottom line is: Dustforce gets old. Fast. It offers almost no variety in its gameplay and the absurd requirement to progress through stages is a cheap way of stepping up the difficulty, which only helps to add to the incessant repetition the player will experience. I cleared one world + a bunch of other stages and saw no point in continuing. It offers no reason to go on beyond getting a good performance on stages, so you can move on to more stages and repeat the process in the exact same way, everytime. I felt like I had already seen all the game had to offer, and that more arrangements of the same stage elements weren't really worth stressing over.It's a shame, really. Dustforce has tight controls and a unique core theme and aesthetics (though it keeps the same kind of mild/serene atmosphere all the way through. I got bored of it after a while). If it just presented new mechanics for each world and/or character and reduced the overly-demanding difficulty a tad (a double-A ranking requirement to get keys for further stages would be a huge improvement) this review could have been a ""Yes"" instead. The way it is, though, I'd only recommend this game to the most time-attack obsessed players with plenty of time to burn and that wouldn't care much for a more varied and rich experience.For everyone else looking for an interesting platforming experience, you're better off looking elsewhere.

It's very tiring on the thumbs.And the keyboard controls are even worse! Even more clunky than a controller! A CONTROLLER!It feels like you're swiping at cotton candy.And worst of all, YOU CAN'T TAKE DAMAGE! THERE IS NO LIFE BAR!There is absolutely no challange to this game!The game is a grind fest.

												This is an absolute gem! If you are the type that loves a challenge and enjoys platforming, this is a must-try game. This game is deceptively simple as there are a few sets of moves and mechanics that govern its world. But, as each level goes on, you start to use them in ways that did not seem apparent to keep your momentum.Some of the great features this game has are the quick-reset. Guys, you are likely to mess up, fail, over and over and OVER again with this. So have a quick-button reset is a great feature, especially for speed runner enthusiasts. This game is built to be played to ways, 1) complete the whole level with 100% finesse at the fastest time possible, or 2) reach the end of the level as quick as you can. Either way, there is something satisfying to both aims, and much more gratification once you see your name inch higher into the ranking boards. "

												One of the most compelling and challenging speedrunners that I've ever played, Dustforce is not a platformer for the casual player. Even though you think you won't go back and try to perfect every level, the game will call out to your inner OCD, not just in the gamer's sense, but also the cleaner's sense.In fact, this is probably not the hypochondriac's kind of game. Unless, of course, you're into that sort of thing.			"

												This is a manic platformer about cleaning up dirt and leaves and so on. I highly reccomend this game for people who enjoy platformer and people who are looking for a challenge. It is a very precise platformer with insane movement and I find it quite hard to put my love for this game into words. If you want to get a feel for the game check out this fantatstic video on it

												My first instinct is to call Dustforce the relaxed cousin of Super Meat Boy, but that's not quite right.  Sure, it's got wall-jumping, air-dashing heroes, but the gameplay is more akin to racing around a track than trying to pass through a hostile environment.  The elegent controls let you achieve a zen that lets you almost float through a level without stopping, all while looking impressive with a top-notch simplistic art style and catchy music.It's not a terribly difficult game, but pulling a double-S rank on a stage is still incredibly rewarding.  Comparing scores with friends and passing the controller is a lot of fun, but the actual multiplayer feels tacked on.  There's no co-op as promised, only a survival deathmatch and king-of-the-hill style play.  For this game, though, multiplayer really isn't necessary to make the title worth the purchase.All in all, it's a hip platformer that's a lot of fun without risking a broken controller.			"

Be warned: some of the harder levels feature controller and/or keyboard smashing difficulty.Also features one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in any game.

												This is nothing more than a fantastic game.  No mind blowing stories, thought provoking characters or awe inspiring views (Although the games art itself is drop dead gorgeous).  The controls are unbelievable tight, the challenge is ridiculously high but fairly so, and the feeling of accomplishment available from this game is like few others I've played.  Pick it up if you're not prone to throwing controllers and generally causing havoc when the rage sets in.			"

												Dustforce is the kind of platform game that requires determination, as you will have to play most of the levels several times before getting a rewarding Double S score, wondering which character would be the best for this level.There is no real time trial mode for the scoring system (the time you take only impacts the world ranking system): as long you don't break your Combo and clean the whole level, you will get your Double S score and be able to unlock new levels faster (that get quickly harder).And the soundtrack sets the mood, helping you to relax even though the new level you're trying to finish is hard as hell.Also, like most of this kind of platformer, you ""should"" really using a controller.

												Great game, at first it may seem simple or easy, but the harder levels will make you want to tear your hair out trying to get that SS score. Great feature is that you can watch the runs of other players if you want to find an efficient way to beat a difficult part.Once you get a hang of the controlls, (I reccomend a game pad), the game is amazing and the sountrack and visuals are very chill, which helps because as I said it can get frustrating to make it through an entire level only to hit that spike right before the last piece of dust. If you like a challenge and have fast fingers than this game is for you.			"

DustForce is perfect as a wind-down game with lovely graphics and pleasant music. The way everything flows is nice and peaceful. I do have only some things I do not like, for one thing when I face a certain direction and you hit attack you seen to be facing the opposite direction you were facing, makes it tough for fighting and hitting attacks in the air. Another one is a similar problem when I jump up to a ledge and hold the up button as it says, I still end up in the wrong direction jumping off the ledge instead of grabbing.But that's the only problems I've had.

The characters all have different little quirks, so if you're having trouble with a level as one, you can switch to another and try again to take advantage of their abilities. Plenty of levels (and a lot of cool fanmade ones as well, which is a huge +), all with varying degress of difficulty, ranging from the, ""Woah, that was easy, finished it under a minute!"" to ""I swear to god, if I fail that jump again I'm going to punch this screen with a shotgun."" difficulty.

												A game for competitive, experienced players, Dust Force combines the fast-paced action you'll get from a fighting game and combines it with a cinematic parkour experience that's perfect for speed-runners. With four characters to choose from, you'll be slowly migrating between these characters and learning how they work. Your first gold level you've unlocked will seem like a walk in the park once you're in the later stages. There's a ton of levels, a slew of hidden mechanics, easter eggs in seemingly all stages, a local multiplayer mode for up to four players, a fantastic level editor, and an experienced community filled with tons of downloadable maps.All in all, if you like fast-paced platformers involving wall-running, timers, an unforgettable soundtrack, and hidden mechanics, this is your game. Thumbs up.			"

												If you have a completionist personality and get addicted to things because of it, you will most certainly get your money's worth out of this game. There's no guarantee you'll enjoy it all, but at least you'll get your money's worth.Dustforce combines speedrunning and combat to create an intense ""race against the clock"" battle in each level. The basis is to clean up as much of the level as you can in order to advance on to the next levels, each one being more difficult than the last.This game prides itself in its level design, and therefore also in its aesthetics. Its levels, characters, enemies, and even movements are visually pleasing, which helps when you play the game for hours on end in order to beat it. The sound design is similar, having a bit of the ""fresh"" element to it in order to keep you from getting sick of playing. Secrets are also scattered around levels, awaiting the player's arrival to reveal themselves--and then unfortunately yield no product. All of this wrapped in a thoroughly-vetted world makes for an overall good game, worth the buy.However, if you're not a completionist, I would approach this purchase with caution. As I said before, because this is an extensive game with many, many levels, you'll get your money's worth, but only if you're able to play them. You can only advance on to the more difficult levels in this game if you beat the previous level well enough, and eventually this stops your progress entirely until you return to fully complete the previous levels (which can be extremely difficult later on). Most importantly, if you're not enjoying it, then you'll more than likely quit and never return. So, again, think well before buying it if you don't want to be completionist and then waste your money.(Also, there is a multiplayer function to this game, but I don't have friends who own the game so I can't say whether that's worth a try or not. Given the game's speed-combat combination, I imagine it would be fun but can't say for certain!)			"

												Highly underrated game about cleaning up areas as fast as you can while keeping combos and speed going. Easy to play, hard to master. High skill ceiling. The leaderboards are kind of ♥♥♥♥ed the last time I check with people beating maps in less than a second, but I never really cared much about leaderboards anyway. There is a ton of content in this game and several playstyles to use. Watch some videos on Youtube, the execution required to pull off perfect runs is on par with DMC and fighting games.			"

												Here's a little indie title that I absolutely LOVED to death. It's a free running, precision platformer (and mind you, I'm not the BIGGEST precision platformer) but I fell in love with the art direction of this game. The controls are tight and the levels are solidly routed to be as free flowing as possible depending on the character you choose (though some characters are better suited to specific levels than others fyi).It's a simple game with simple goals and you can start and stop any time. I personally aced every level until I reached the bonus level whereupon I gave up because they required godlike reflexes that I simply do not possess but I had fun nonetheless. Give this a try if you have some cash and time to spare, even if it's only 5-10 minutes at a time.			"

												This is one of the best indie games I have played. The game concept is so simple yet it is executed so well. The artwork and animation is amazing and fluid. It's one of those games that if you're really good at playing it looks so cool. Soundtrack is one of the best I heard of, I have a hard time getting these catchy tunes out of my head. Controls are nice and smooth as well; however, I recommend you get a gamepad, if you don't hate yourself (default controls on pc are pretty bad, but that can be changed). The only bad side really is the difficulty. I have beaten every level except Yotta Difficult(really game designers? I like a good challenge but jeez), and I have taken so much time. I'd be lying if I said I didn't rage when I almost got an SS rank on a hard level after 3 hours. So yes, there is a high-learning curve to this game, but you get exponentially better as you play more so don't let that discourage you. There is always a challenge in this game, which would appeal to any hardcore gamer. Still, this game deserves 10/10.			"

												A nice spin on... I don't even know what to compare it to.If you combine Super Meat Boy, Mirror's Edge and N you might get something like Dustforce.You try to run and jump your way through a large number of levels as fast as possible while, well, cleaning dust or to be more accurate, foliage.The combination of wall jumping and multiple jumps by dusting of flying enemies gets you into a flow in which you will want to complete every level. But the difficulty rises fast and this game will make you retry a level many many times even if you somehow beat it, especially then. "

												Honestly, this is one of the most awesome platformers I've ever played.It's also the most difficult platformer I've ever played.Visuals are amazing, soundtrack kicks♥♥♥♥♥ presentation is very slick. But the real reason this game shines is because of the platforming.The way that you move about the environment is, for lack of a better term, beautiful. You can double-jump, dash around, slide down slopes, and run up walls and across ceilings. All of the levels test your ability to string together and combine these skills as you run through.At first, just trying to complete some levels is a daunting task. Many of the harder stages require some pixel- or frame-perfect actions to maneuver through tight corridors full of spikes. I never became frustrated with dying in this game because I always felt like a death or a combo break was my fault and not the game's. But once I cleared a difficult stage with a double-S rating, it was an awesome feeling every time. Getting through a level on a perfect run looks and feels like an intricate dance, and it provides a level of satisfaction that surpasses any other platformer I've played.All that said, I don't think I will ever beat this game. The late-game stages are just insanely brutal, and I'm not sure that I can spend the numerous hours needed to optimize my movement through just one of them to get a double-S. But I'm quite okay with that, and I'll definitely try anyway.			"

												If you search for one of the hardest games on the planet, look no further.This piece of software will crush your fingers, in a positive sense. Remember meatboy? Okay, Dustforce is like Meatboy, just at least 3 times that complex. You don't have just jump and walljump, you have dash, jump, walljump, slide, hit, heavy hit, wallrun, ceilingrun and and...It is basically extreme parcour in 2d format.Which is awesome, it plays extremely fluid and you can easily sink into a single level and trying to achieve a better time, this game can become your biggest nemesis and at the same time your best friend.Besides of the amazing gameplay the graphics are superb for an indie game, and the soundtrack is on it's own is incredible (+editor!).The only downside that game can have (besides destroying you mentally and physically) would be that it can run quite bad on some pcs.As long as you don't like platformers or only want ♥♥♥♥♥-games, I see no reason why you shouldn't grab this game immediately			"

Checkpointing is done nicely and the ability to see other players replays is a nice touch. The tutorial seems somewhat tough for a newbie but it does introduce all the core mechanics. The difficulty ramps up rather quickly and you'll either want to spend some time in the tutorial experimenting what you can/cannot do or watch replays of other players.

												When I first seen this game, I wanted it and added it to my wishlist.  Just looked like a fun, hop around, kill, and completion game.However I did not enjoy it nearly to the point I thought I would.  This is actually more like Super Meat Boy with brooms.  Only not as fun, not as funny, and controls not nearly as tight.Not a bad game, but I felt myself being bugged by the controls and there is no real combat: only appears that way.The basic idea is that you pick a zone, then pick an area within the zone to clean dust/leaves/goo by jumping and sliding along the walls.  At the end you kill a few monsters who cannot hurt you and the level is over.  You get points to unlock keys to open more areas to do the same thing.Each of the four janitors plays a little different, but all of them feel a bit awkward or delayed.  More of a muscle memory on some of the levels and not precise contrtols.  Just not as good as what I wanted.			"

												Looking for an ultra-hard, stylish, hi-score oriented platformer? Oh look here's one right now!At first I thought it would be like a Super Meat Boy, and in a way it is, but... if you think any of your hard-learned Meat Boy prowess will help you here, you are gravely mistaken and you are going to need to waterproof your gamepad and/or keyboard because there will be a lot of tears.Meat Boy's approach to wall jumping mechanics was very simple, and the challenges were largely about precision.Dustforce take a much more strict approach. Rather than simply megaman your way up a wall, you can run up it- for a short distance. Then you'll either need a facing wall, or to spend your precious precious second jump, the one you can't get back without landing on solid ground or killing an enemy in midair. You can also run along slopes and ceilings, air dash, and a number of other fancy tricks that look super cool but all add complexity.The challenges here are not only about precision, but also working out how long you can save that air jump, which direction to hold (or not hold) when you make contact with the wall, or how to get that extra bit of dust up on the ceiling.Unfortunately, the experience is hurt a little by slightly picky controls and the rather annoying way momentum is handled when you've wall-run up to the edge of a platform (or anything treated as one, whether it has spikes on it or not).All in all, I enjoy it, even though the gold-key levels make me furious.

												I bought this because the sountrack + game bundle on steam was only $1 more than the soundtrack off the artist's Bandcamp page.  I already liked the music so I'd figure for a dollar more I'd try the game.Arguably, this is not my game.  I dont find enjoyment in time trials, or in repeat-til-learned drilling gameplay.  I just don't appreciate it.  So that said, it is hard for me to evaluate this game because that's what the game is.  The music is great, I love that.  It helps add a lot to the aesthetic and the game is stylish and captures a feeling of 'coolness' nicely.  I can't comment on the controls because I have no frame of reference.  The game is demanding so naturally I felt flustered and struggled to accomplish the desired action.  As I said, its not my kind of game.So I guess I'd say pick this up if you like games like Super Meat Boy or N+?  It has a local multiplayer mode somewhat lightly comparable to SSB without items or health meters, but its not online so application for alternative play is limited.			"

												IMO feels a little similar to Super Meat Boy. They both have tight controls, precise jumping and timing is required, and very nice soundtracks. At first, the controls felt a little awkward but with some investment you'll find that you can do some very complex movements with ease and you'll be rewarded with seeing dust trails cleanly disapear under your feet. I would highly recommend Dustforce if you're into hard 2d platformers  and don't mind a bit of a learning curve.			"

												Regretted buying this game for the first two hours because I sucked and it was hard. Unlocking levels is unique and kind of frustrating at first. Super fun and great soundtrack. If you're relatively unexperienced in platformers like I was you will find some of the other levels very challenging to beat!I bought it on sale for $2.74 but the game is probably worth the full $11 if you're into platformers.

												This is a game with emphasis on tight controls and complex movements, and it delivers. Tons of levels with a nice level variety from short, dense obstacles to lengthy gauntlets, all with gradually building difficulty. And, with the addition of the DX levels, some stages test your ability to perform tricky and nuanced maneuvers. If you want a platformer with a steady learning curve and a high skill ceiling, this is definitely worth a look.			"

												What a great addition to the platformer genre. Dustforce is an indie action platformer from Hitbox Team. Let’s get rocking.The GoodI love platformers and Dustforce made me remember why I love platformers. Everything about this game is well done and polished until it shines.First thing first, you’ll be hard pressed to find another game with as good a soundtrack as the one that accompanies Dustforce. It is pure, relaxing majesty and nothing could possibly fit this game better in terms of music. It makes you feel good while you play.The art is phenomenal. Character designs are simple and beautiful, enemies are original, and the environments themselves will provide you with a good eyeful as well.The controls are smooth and fluid. You can easily transition from floors to ceilings in a matter of seconds, all the while cleaning the living hell out of dust ridden creatures and persons. Dustforce is, essentially, 2D parkour and I love it.There are a huge amount of levels for you to play through with four different characters, all of whom have their own play style. Not only does the core game have over 100 levels, but there are a heaping amount of user created levels that you can play through as well. The fun doesn’t have to end with this one, ever.The BadNothing. Nothing at all my friends.The MehSee the above category, please.Verdict: YeaDustforce is a lighthearted, refreshing platformer that serious and casual gamers alike can enjoy at their leisure. If you’re looking for something new to play, look no further. As always, thanks for reading.			"

												Highly recommand this game.The game is with great graphic detail which is nice for any 2D games. The art style is fancy. Movements animations are smooth and swift. The actions are well connected. Musics are also well developed and fit every map well.This is a skillful game, and the gameplay is flexible. Some complained about the fast gaming and the hard combos; I regard these the real fun of this game. In any map, I can finish the game in anyway I want and try to have it perfect, fluent. This gives players unlimited possibilities. The combo throughout each game is fascinating for me, compared to the games with slow rhythm and always inconsistent and broken in moves. This game never prevent the chance to be consistent. The way to finish is always flexible. When checking out the record of the game, I can always find the best players finishing with unusual way and skills.The game have great feeling of control. Though it got to be a speedrunning game, Dustforce still gets the nice feeling when you strike down, jump or attack. It has nice timing in the air to react into next move.The only cons for this game I  may say is the UI is not so welcoming. It is not well decorated. And some transactions in the ""Main World"" are too abrupt.			"

												Dustforce is a bipolar experience. Sublimely calming throughout with an insurmountable skill level.  The things that make Dustforce one of my favorite games are things that seem obvious a few years out now, but they're worth saying for someone who hasn't experienced it.  The soundtrack, by Lifeformed, is transcendent.  It has trappings of dubstep and chillwave but so much attention gets paid to cohesive textures and melodies that no song becomes just a genre-piece.  You will listen to this soundtrack outside of the game, and I've played this sountrack at work, heard it used on NPR, and my friends who have never played Dustforce have heard it.  The visuals are  better than they need to be.  They could have been retro 8 or 16-bit, which would make sense with the pizel perfect gameplay, or they could have been bulky flash graphics, or boring minimalist nonsense, or they could have been cheesy 3D graphics, or anything else that you'll find by flipping through the other platformers on Steam.  Instead, what they are are a beautiful flat colors, equally evoking 16-bit clarity and Gamecueb-era cel shading.  The game could have been a linear experience, lacking a hub-world and natural progression like Super Mario 3D Land.  But what we get is a branching, growing, player-guided progression through multiple worlds in a hubworld that is more of a sequel to Peach's Castle from Super Mario 64 than anything.  In order to access certain levels, you have to develop the skills necessary to play through those levels by traversing increasingly difficult areas of the hub world, accomplishing not only training a new player but evoking exploration and the unique atmospheres of each world.  It's these reasons that make Dustforce an experience that's larger than it's parts, a charming, sublime experience that respects the skill of whoever plays it without trying to intimidate you or restrict your experience.  Absolutely required.			"

												Pleasing to the eye, ear and mind, dustforce is a great platformer that will keep you sweeping for hours on end. -Gorgeous art style, full of charm and character with consistently themed levels with sprites to match. One of the things I love most about this game is the soundtrack, its mellow tones are relaxing and blend seamlessly with the gameplay, softening the frustration at my inept cleaning.  -Gameplay is consistently challenging, but as you repeat levels you gradually learn the layout and the best/fastest way to clear each and every obstacle. There is nothing more rewarding than when you get that perfect run (well, not perfect, but as good as I'm going to do). The momentum based character movement did take some getting used to, but after much practice it allows you to flit through a level like a breath of wind.-The main area in which Dustforce is lacking would be the tutorial, it provides a good basic understanding of the movement mechanics and will make a player reasonably competent. However, to play dustforce to its full, flowing potential it is a necessity to go on youtube and watch tutorials and examine the manouvres and tricks used by the best of the best.			"

Chances are it'll make you angry when you are having trouble sometimes, but once you get over your gap, the reward is great, and a new challenge is there.  At some point you just realize, everything it has you do is fair, and you start to really enjoy the challenge.  Probably played this more then any other platformer ever.			"

												If you have a completionist personality and get addicted to things because of it, you will most certainly get your money's worth out of this game. There's no guarantee you'll enjoy it all, but at least you'll get your money's worth.Dustforce combines speedrunning and combat to create an intense ""race against the clock"" battle in each level. The basis is to clean up as much of the level as you can in order to advance on to the next levels, each one being more difficult than the last.This game prides itself in its level design, and therefore also in its aesthetics. Its levels, characters, enemies, and even movements are visually pleasing, which helps when you play the game for hours on end in order to beat it. The sound design is similar, having a bit of the ""fresh"" element to it in order to keep you from getting sick of playing. Secrets are also scattered around levels, awaiting the player's arrival to reveal themselves--and then unfortunately yield no product. All of this wrapped in a thoroughly-vetted world makes for an overall good game, worth the buy.However, if you're not a completionist, I would approach this purchase with caution. As I said before, because this is an extensive game with many, many levels, you'll get your money's worth, but only if you're able to play them. You can only advance on to the more difficult levels in this game if you beat the previous level well enough, and eventually this stops your progress entirely until you return to fully complete the previous levels (which can be extremely difficult later on). Most importantly, if you're not enjoying it, then you'll more than likely quit and never return. So, again, think well before buying it if you don't want to be completionist and then waste your money.(Also, there is a multiplayer function to this game, but I don't have friends who own the game so I can't say whether that's worth a try or not. Given the game's speed-combat combination, I imagine it would be fun but can't say for certain!)			"

												As of writing this review I only have put 1 hour into the game, and let me say that I am blown away. Everything about this game is amazing, whether it be the music, combat, or fluid motion. I wasn't sure what I was getting into when I started playing, but quickly fell in love. You learn the mechanics quickly in the game, and as you progress you learn how to use them even more. I personally LOVE the way the lobby is set up, where you run around to get to each level. It just feels so good to play and complete levels in this game, and it looks beautiful. Fantastic work, I'd recomend this game to anyone.			"

												Dustforce is a non-linear action platformer, but it's split into levels. There are four main worlds that each hold different levels: some easy and fun, one beat down the enemies and some no-nonsence action. You can go to each of these worlds at any time you want, but some levels are locked. You get keys to unlock these locks by completing levels. The better you do on a level, the the more progress toward getting a key is made. So to unlock every single level, you have to get a perfect score (an SS in this case) on every level. That may seem very hard (and it is), but I've been having fun all the time trying to get a perfect score on every level no matter how long it takes me. I spent an hour or so trying to get one level down and I enjoyed every second of it (I still haven't SS'd that level). The gameplay is fun and makes you feel like awesome no matter how poorly you did on a level and the art style is amazing, as well as the music.			"

												So, I love this game. You pick one of four janitors and glide around cleaning up messes, and fighting enemies possessed by dust.  It's one of those precision platformers where its all about getting faster completion times and better scores. The base game has dozens and dozens of levels, but there is a pretty active mod community that has made a ton of maps. Also the music is AWESOME. I ended up paying additional for the soundtrack because it is so good. The artstyle is a great animated style, and when you get the hang of the controls it feels great to glide through levels.			"

												As a general rule, if a game can really make me feel like a ninja, it is automatically good in my book. Great level design and controls make this game hit that mark; you'll be doing all kinds of fancy acrobatics easily. Thanks to the fact that a good score requires you to keep up a combo you'll also be doing it in one continuous string for the whole level, but almost never feeling like you're in a time crunch if you plan your route right.Other good points include: Great atmosphere, lots of secrets in both the levels and the hub (in fact you have to find most of the harder levels by exploring the hub), four different but balanced characters (all of whom can still beat every level), and the harder levels often make you think to solve them and can be quite difficult.

The levels are challenging, and you'll fail a lot, but that's part of the fun. The soundtrack keeps you relaxed all the way through, and it's an amazing listen even without the game. The devs hit the art style right on the mark, with the minimalist designs working with the gameplay to add some clarity to the scenes which are very nice to look at.Buy it. This game is underrated.

												This is a 2D platformer that has you cleaning the ""dirt"" from the floors, walls and ceilings of the platforms. You are graded on completeness and finesse and getting high grades can earn you keys to unlock harder levels. And there are four different characters with minor variations in ability that you can play as.I played thru each level that I could with each character once or twice, But I don't really feel compelled to do any more. The graphics and music are good, But there are either some control issues or I'm just not any good at it. But, Whatever.Edit - Closer to a thumbs up than a thumbs down.			"

It seems like one of those trial-and-error, play-til-perfection games ala Super Meat Boy that I just would get frustrated and don't have the patience for. Great soundtrack and visuals though! Just not my kind of game. It feels weird to go around recommending games that 'might be good if I enjoyed the genre' or 'its good, but its not for me.' I -can- recommend it though, for people who -like- that sort of thing; the controls are there, the mechanics, the competition and community. So in the end, I can at least recommend it for that.			"

												I'm horrible at this game, but the soundtrack is one of the best. I basically bought this game just for the music. :P I might try to play it again sometime, because altough it is pretty hard to get a high score it is not completely required for you to unlock additional levels so, that is good and there are two leaderboards for either cleaning everything fast or finishing the level as fast as possible even if you don't clean every single dirt. It is also nice to be able to watch replay from other people. Not my kind of game, but my kind of music. I also bought it with a discount so, great!			"

												Really difficult at first but  very rewarding and complex. Has a lot of interesting mechanics to play with (jumps resets on walls, speedups, wallrunning ect...) so it will take some time to master.Some doors to access levels are really hard to get to and I think I wont be able to play those levels simply because I cant get to the doors. We should be able to access them through the menu instead of having to get up those places before.			"

												This is one of the only incredibly difficult games that do not frustrate me. Whenever I make a mistake I can get right back to playing the level again, it dosn't costantly tell me how difficult it is, and it dosn't taunt me for making a mistake. The most effeint way of clearing a level is also the most stylish. Very rewarding game, definetly worth the cost.			"

												This is my dream job and something I look forward to becoming after attending college, a sanitary engineering. This game teaches the basics of what it means to be a janitor. Sweeping is a lot harder than it seems, and is a lot more skilled and adventurous than you can imagine. Along your typical ""sweep"" work, you can encounter monsters and other various foes. This game trains you for the real world and offers a very professional and helpful insight for those in the janitorial, or I would say, sanitary engineer career path.			"

												So I got Dusforce about the time it came out or a little bit later...can't really remember and at the time I didn't invest alot of time into it, but having recently played a little of it and it being updated to DX, which adds new content, I decided to write this review. This game is one of those that have a really high skill cap and you will need to play it alot to master it and get the best times and scores, its in the Super Meat Boy Platformer category, one thing that is different is that you have to platform to get to the doors, which are level entry points and some of those doors are hard to get to so you actually need to be able to traverse the ""level select"" in order to complete all levels. There are a fair amount of levels, I'd say it would take 5-10hours max to beat all the levels(mostly because the end ones are hard and you will need to take alot of shots at them), but after you beat those you also have community created levels which are amazing and will keep you playing if you really want more. This game is a good bit of fun if you are into this type of games and an excellent purchase on sale, if you don't like the game I would still recommend the soundtrack because it is Phenomenal!			"

The levels are challenging, and you'll fail a lot, but that's part of the fun. The soundtrack keeps you relaxed all the way through, and it's an amazing listen even without the game. The devs hit the art style right on the mark, with the minimalist designs working with the gameplay to add some clarity to the scenes which are very nice to look at.Buy it. This game is underrated.

												This is an absolute gem! If you are the type that loves a challenge and enjoys platforming, this is a must-try game. This game is deceptively simple as there are a few sets of moves and mechanics that govern its world. But, as each level goes on, you start to use them in ways that did not seem apparent to keep your momentum.Some of the great features this game has are the quick-reset. Guys, you are likely to mess up, fail, over and over and OVER again with this. So have a quick-button reset is a great feature, especially for speed runner enthusiasts. This game is built to be played to ways, 1) complete the whole level with 100% finesse at the fastest time possible, or 2) reach the end of the level as quick as you can. Either way, there is something satisfying to both aims, and much more gratification once you see your name inch higher into the ranking boards. "

YouTube™ Video: Underrated Games - Dustforce 

			Views: 77,271		

			After spending way longer than I expected with Dustforce I decided to lay down some thoughts on it. Some footage here is taken from the community replays, in those instances the player's name will be...		

------N with Donkey Kong Country 2 music.Indie platformer (THE PRESSES HAVE BEEN HALTED) about passing over specific spots and adminstering parental-style broom violence to enemies (who are sometimes tiny animals, you jerk.) No plot to follow. You have to 'SS' perfect each level to progress entirely, so you'll need more dedication than your megamans.The thing I enjoyed the most, is due to the generally sharp mechancis, there can be room to do suave recoveries. Lower ranked ss replays on the (well-implemented) leaderboards have been more mind-boggling because of this. However, there's many places that require pixel perfect actions (or some tricks, which are admittedly fun to figure out,) and the level designer has a habit of placing a cluster♥♥♥♥ of awkward near the end of a level. Slip up, and you're forced to restart. I spent 5 hours on one.But damn if that music doesn't keep you going.-And then I got calluses from a vido game for the first time.Basically, liked meat boy? Try this.			"

												The apocalypse has finally dawned upon mankind. Men and women from all around the world gather around to see society's collapse. An alien beam has pulverized all means of transportation on rails, and civilization as we know it has crumbled. The morale of humans as a species is at an all time low, and apathy reigns over the shadow of the world that once was. Apathy such, that it is up to a group of four survivors to clean the world, and eliminate all evidence of trains ever existing, so that mankind may start anew.			"

												3...2...1... LET'S DUST!I never thought that phrase would be something to look forward to. Dustforce is a fantastic skill based platformer with a perfect difficulty curve, tight controls & gorgeous visuals. The gameplay is fast paced yet at the same time somehow relaxing. Nothing ever feels unachieveable in this game but still maintains a great challenge. This is definitely the most unique indie title I've played this year and already one of my favorites.			"

												One of the most enthralling platformers Ive played in a while. Its got a bit of a learning curve but once you get there it offers a zen like experience. On the other end, it has some incredibly punishing levels that I have yet been unable to finish but thats what keeps you coming back, its nice to have a mix of difficulty and fun like that. The art direction is fantastic, each area and level has a unique and cohesive deisgn that just feels right, not to mention the beautiful layered backrounds. But if that wasnt enough, the soundtrack is mezmerizing, I absolutely love it. Definitely a good buy.			"

												An exceptionally chill platformer. The controls can be a hastle to get used to (I personally had to remap a few keys), but once you get a solid handle on it, speeding your way to a clean SS rank is greatly rewarding after your n-th try. One had better be ready to get good though, because the only way to progress to subsequent, more difficult levels is to get high ranks on the previous stages.Also the visuals are clean and crisp, and the soundtrack is definitely worth a listen.

												A game for competitive, experienced players, Dust Force combines the fast-paced action you'll get from a fighting game and combines it with a cinematic parkour experience that's perfect for speed-runners. With four characters to choose from, you'll be slowly migrating between these characters and learning how they work. Your first gold level you've unlocked will seem like a walk in the park once you're in the later stages. There's a ton of levels, a slew of hidden mechanics, easter eggs in seemingly all stages, a local multiplayer mode for up to four players, a fantastic level editor, and an experienced community filled with tons of downloadable maps.All in all, if you like fast-paced platformers involving wall-running, timers, an unforgettable soundtrack, and hidden mechanics, this is your game. Thumbs up.			"

It takes a while to fully appreciate it and master it but when you have done it you realise that there is a flow in this game and a genius in the level design. I can go through a level just for the pleasure of following that flow and the music goes with it perfectly.It is a challenging game, very challenging in the end. If you can’t handle frustration it might not be for you but it is also rewarding if you can go through it.I can’t recommend it enough.

Truelly a new gen platformer classic like Super Meat Boy.You can play ""casually"" and try to unlock every level or you can get familiar with levels and climb your way up to leaderboards. Both ways are fun but the later one is where the game really shines. The feeling of actually nailing that difficult run, incomparable.The movement and responsiveness of the characters is one of best ones ever seen in games. All that goes wrong is fault of the player. Using keyboard is strongly adviced.			"

												Great game, at first it may seem simple or easy, but the harder levels will make you want to tear your hair out trying to get that SS score. Great feature is that you can watch the runs of other players if you want to find an efficient way to beat a difficult part.Once you get a hang of the controlls, (I reccomend a game pad), the game is amazing and the sountrack and visuals are very chill, which helps because as I said it can get frustrating to make it through an entire level only to hit that spike right before the last piece of dust. If you like a challenge and have fast fingers than this game is for you.			"

												Highly difficult platformer in the vein of Super Meat Boy, but with much more fluid controls, an art style that's calming to the eyes, and a soundtrack so soothing that trying to beat a level for the hundredth time doesn't feel as frustrating as similar games, if at all. Best of all, it rewards skill: for each level you clear perfectly you gain a key which you can use to unlock a harder level of your choice, making it feel as though you're actually progressing. Unlike similar titles like I Wanna Be The Guy and the aforementioned Super Meat Boy, which tired me after a while and forced me to only play them in short bursts, Dustforce's aesthetic and clever level design kept me in a trance, encouraging me to play more, as if telling me that I'll always do better next time - and I did. Buy it. Now.			"

The controls are unbelievable tight, the challenge is ridiculously high but fairly so, and the feeling of accomplishment available from this game is like few others I've played.  Pick it up if you're not prone to throwing controllers and generally causing havoc when the rage sets in.			"

												Beautiful and addicting. While progressing in this game does not require perfection, the serene experienceof completing a level without breaking your combo is incredibly rewarding. Simple yet crisp animations are tied together by one of the finest soundtracks I have everheard in a game. Buy this game. Buy two copies.			"

												Dustforce is the kind of platform game that requires determination, as you will have to play most of the levels several times before getting a rewarding Double S score, wondering which character would be the best for this level.There is no real time trial mode for the scoring system (the time you take only impacts the world ranking system): as long you don't break your Combo and clean the whole level, you will get your Double S score and be able to unlock new levels faster (that get quickly harder).And the soundtrack sets the mood, helping you to relax even though the new level you're trying to finish is hard as hell.Also, like most of this kind of platformer, you ""should"" really using a controller.

Think Fighting games controls embedded in a very complex and fun platformer. ""WHAT'S THAT SANVICH? PERFECTLY JUMP THEM ALL? GOOD IDEA!"" - Heavy.			"

												Dustforce is the most satisifiying platformer I have played in years, and heres why:Story: NA/10There is none.Gameplay: 9.8/10The gameplay is a mix of mirrors edge and janitorial duties, allowing your character to leap off the walls and traverse the enviroment in fluid, dynamic movement. It's nothing short of simply breathtaking, and looks just as good to watch as it is to play, but only slightly. Everything has this great sense of weight and momentum to it- your air dash is small, but builds momentum insanely quickly, sending you into top speed in a flash, running up walls is quick and sticky, meaning getting around on walls, ceilings and ramps is a breeze. The combat, while simple, serves as an excellent momentum booster. Smack an enemy in the air, and your air-dash or double jump becomes replenished, increasing your jump distance and allowing you to pull off some crazy crap. It's utterly fantastic.Graphics: 8/10They're simple, stylish and beautiful. The leaves, slime, dust and trash all liven up the levels, and even suggest where to go next. They add a lot of charm.Music: 8.2/10Great to listen to in and out of Dustforce, and is relaxing enough to not make you frustrated.Overall: 8.6			"

												This is an absolute gem! If you are the type that loves a challenge and enjoys platforming, this is a must-try game. This game is deceptively simple as there are a few sets of moves and mechanics that govern its world. But, as each level goes on, you start to use them in ways that did not seem apparent to keep your momentum.Some of the great features this game has are the quick-reset. Guys, you are likely to mess up, fail, over and over and OVER again with this. So have a quick-button reset is a great feature, especially for speed runner enthusiasts. This game is built to be played to ways, 1) complete the whole level with 100% finesse at the fastest time possible, or 2) reach the end of the level as quick as you can. Either way, there is something satisfying to both aims, and much more gratification once you see your name inch higher into the ranking boards. "

Ok, this game has an interesting concept where you have to clean the rooms as fast as possible. I think this is the problem because the usual metroidvania fanboy like me love game with quests and things that this game lack of.I recommended this game if you love platformer where you can challenge your skill, to test how fast your hands and how good you memorized the level.

												An amazingly smooth and chill platforming game with insanely good music, pleasing visuals and excellent level design that runs butter smooth on almost any machine. The focus here is mechanics, which are all well implemented, and once you master the basics movements and learn how the dash can be used, it opens up a whole new world of possibilities.Some levels can be very frustrating at first, no doubt about it, but the aforementioned great music can keep you calm for long periods of time. The immensely satisfying feeling of seeing an SS ranking and a good time on the end screen after working hard to get there makes this such an easy title to recommend. It's time trial without the stress.The flow of movements and consistence is more important here than in other platformers, and these are probably the defining properties of Dustforce. There's never a time where you'll get lucky, and perfect a level, and there are few random elements in the game. Being able to see records of other players and friends can help you improve by a ton, and gives you something to strive for.			"

												This is a 2D platformer that has you cleaning the ""dirt"" from the floors, walls and ceilings of the platforms. You are graded on completeness and finesse and getting high grades can earn you keys to unlock harder levels. And there are four different characters with minor variations in ability that you can play as.I played thru each level that I could with each character once or twice, But I don't really feel compelled to do any more. The graphics and music are good, But there are either some control issues or I'm just not any good at it. But, Whatever.Edit - Closer to a thumbs up than a thumbs down.			"

												Dustforce is the kind of game I want to get good at, and feel like I am, until I see my rankings on the leaderboards. Mechanically, I haven't played a platformer that responds so well. Once you wrestle out the way to bind your keys to your gamepad, prepare to be blown away by the insane amount of love put in to make this godly platformer. Gameplay and animation is insanely fluid, and while controls can be a bit floaty, they lend themselves well to the levels designed around it, and gives generous space failure, even when your inner speed demon does not. This game must be noted as one without any notable story, and is built solely around replay value, so if you're like me and enjoy a veil of plot to your games, you won't find it here. Honestly, with how much the game screams of personality, and with all the bear-cleaning and animal smacking, I felt like there was a missed opportunity in set up, but this is not a detractor. There is a lot of humor to be found in just the enviornment, and like any good p0rn, you're not here for the story. Wonderful game if you want to feel inferior and still have a great time.			"

												Another beautiful indie game!  Last year it was Jamestown for me, this year it might well be Dustforce.This is a great looking, acrobatic/ninja-rific platformer with a chilled out electronic score and a nice scaling difficultly level.  Imagine Meatboy, but way less frustrating and soul-crushingly difficult, plus more move variety, and rewarding combat. (!)While levels can be beat without necessarily being an ace player, for me there's a strong, strong ""I know I can do better"" urge after completing a run, so there's a lot of value here if you're a perfectionist.  And the game's beautiful graphics, balletic animations and excellent level design always reward me for coming back to previous challenges.Lastly, the ability to watch replays of the top players is also an excellent addition, both to help you see how others solved tricky spots and to help you improve your game.This is a real gem, grab it if you like platformers with style!EDIT: I've enjoyed my time with Dust Force, but unforunately I feel like I've hit the skill ceiling.  I've gotten to a point in the levels where I'm just not good enough to progress further, and don't think it's worth my entertainment time to put in the hours to get better.  This in NO WAY is the fault of the game or it's developers.  I still think Dust Force is amazing, but unfortunately I just won't be able to crack open its higher level content.			"

Jumping off walls, Running up them, Hanging from the ceilings, unleashing a flurry of strikes on enemies to clean them up with a broom, feather duster(s), or even a friggin' puff of air from a vaccuum! I mean...Come on, you TOTALLY don't see this kind of thing happen everyday. This game is totally worth the money. And at a low price too. You'd be a damn fool not to buy it while it's hot. And this game IS HOT.			"

												I was mislead into thinking the peaceful atmosphere meant the game was slow-paced and easy.  Instead, it requires quick thinking and has fist-shaking difficulty reminiscent of VVVVVV or Super Meat Boy.  Pretty cool soundtrack and pleasing visual art make for a rare beast: an original platforming experience.			"

												Dustforce is a challenging action arcade platformer in the same vein as Super Meat Boy.  The graphics are serviceable, and the music is exceptionally well done.  I appreciate the fact that the developers attempted to harken back to old style 8-bit audio without actually giving us the terribly awful reality of it (like in Wizorb).  Though the game does work with the Steam Overlay and supports widescreen, the gamepad support is not very well implemented and will require the player to manually reconfigure the control scheme to work.  I found the the native keyboard controls to be cramped and non-intuitive, particularly for a game that requires fast reflexes.  Other users on the forums have reported they prefer the keyboard for later in the game, but I have not progressed far enough to have an opinion one way or another.  Dustforce in short, is a quality indie game that will resonate with fans of Super Meat Boy or VVVVVVvvvvVVVV.			"

												Get a frickin controller, sit down, and prepare for an awesome platoformer. The goal of this game is to remove all the dust and dust monsters, and while that sounds like the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ idea in human history, this game is 78 kinds of epic. By using various forms of wall jumping, wall running, ceiling jumping, ceiling running, mid-air jumps, mid-air hit multipiers, and etc., you end up feeling like spider-man on cocaine as you bounce around levels ""dusting"" things up. I got this as part of the Humble Bundle, and I couldn't be happier it was included. This game is well worth the full price in my humble opinion, and I can't stop myself from trying to get perfect scores on some of these crazy levels!			"

												What happens when someone wants to make a game about janitors with the control scheme of Megaman Zero and a pinch of Sonic the Hedgehog's speed? We get Dustforce.Each of the game's ""worlds"" contain plenty of pre-unlocked levels to master as you meander your way through them one after another to unlock the rest of the more challenging and meaty ones. As boring as collecting dust sounds, the mechanic of picking it up without letting your combo meter drop makes every level challenging and fun. The addition of a high-score board for each level adds tons of replayability even after you've mastered a level.Dustforce is an excellent and subtely-challenging game that I definitely recommend picking up.

												Dustforce is one of my favourite  platformers ever. The animations are really smooth with a lovely style, the music is soothing and the later levels are incredibly hard and requires close to perfect precision and timing. If it wasn't for the quality of the art and music I would have quite of frustation quite early, it's really enjoyable to play despite frustation and once you get the hang of it you're able to pull of really awesome moves.The game also saves ghosts for every players best run which are automatically uploaded and really easy to access. It's helps a lot when you aren't able to figure out how to do a close to perfect run in some of the harder levels.My only gripe with dustforce is the limited controller support. I'm generally using a xbox360 controller and it required some fidgeting to get it to work as I liked. It's a wonderfull game and you should definitely get it if you're into hardcore platformers.			"

Chances are it'll make you angry when you are having trouble sometimes, but once you get over your gap, the reward is great, and a new challenge is there.  At some point you just realize, everything it has you do is fair, and you start to really enjoy the challenge.  Probably played this more then any other platformer ever.			"

												~~My first review~~  Let me first explain my negative review. Ultimately, I wouldn't recommend this game to myself. Rather, I would recommend Dustforce to masochists, personal enemies, and professional platform gamers. I really wanted to like Dustforce. The promo videos made it seem like one casually 'ninjas' and floats about beautiful 16 bit levels collecting cobwebs like Sonic collects rings. Not quite. The concept itself is interesting. The goal is to travel through obstical courses as fast as possible. Along the way, you must run through patches of dust and hit ""enemies"" in order to clear the level. This is a 2D speed-running game.  The physics and mechanics make absolutely no sense to the uninitiated casual game playing plebian like myself. It can be frustrating, repetative and time consuming simply jumping from platform to platform in the overworld. This is where you wander around finding doors to unlock, which represent individual levels. Compare with titles like Super Meat Boy and Cave Story. These games present challenging and interesting game play, while having control schemes and movement that are predictable and intuitive. Dustforce DX creates simple levels, that are made challenging by a character that is difficult to control. Essentially, they took a relatively simple concept and made it difficult to enjoy on account of sloppy, tendinitis aggravating controls that are frustrating to learn and maddening to master. Further, the actual levels are fairly uninteresting and easy to get through. The challenge is that in order to properly complete a level, simply getting through it is not enough. You need to get the fastest time possible without missing any dust. This means repeating levels until you have every move perfected. This ends up being more busy work than anything else. You could easily spend a thousand hours trying to perfect each level. Combined with controls that assault your hands, it can be a very unforgiving process of which I quickly grew tired. I suppose in the Genre of repetitive games which slap you around and demand perfection it succeeds. However, I guess I'm not a fan of games where developers decided the best way to make a game challenging is to make the character barely controllable. I feel like back in the days of original 8 bit graphic platformers, this would simply be called bad controls and it would be relegated to 2 and 3 star reviews. These days there are gamers who specifically enjoy and excel at games with lousy controls, and I suspect if you're one of those people you will find a lot of fun in spending countless hours punishing yourself on Dustforce.  Recall the viral flash game where the object is to control a sprinters limbs to push him over the finish line, or rather see how far you can comically stumble and hobble across a track. This is the same concept taken to it's inevitable extreme... OK, it's not THAT bad, but you'll be spending a half hour trying to jump onto a ledge just to get to another stage... only to discover that you don't have the key to unlock it. Oh right, keys. In order to unlock all the levels, you will need to complete the stages with perfect scores to accumulate keys. Ugh. Summary; If you are considering using the standard keyboard layout, either get an ice pack for your hands or forget about it. The game is barely playable on a game-pad, which is far superior to the keyboard controls. If you're a demi-god with spaghetti fingers and the ability to pick up outrageous controls, and have a lot of time and patience, I guess you will LOVE this game. If you're a casual gamer who likes simple controls, and doesn't want to invest the hours it will take to teach your hands to waltz like noodles through endlessly repetitive levels of dust ninja then get Super Meat Boy instead.

												I did not know what to expect when I started this game. But I can say that I was pleasantly surprised. Within Dustforce DX is some of the most precise, well-constructed 2D platforming that you can experience. Its unique concept and fair set-up allows you to enjoy the game, no matter what your skill level. This is especially true provided the time and score system. If I were to provide a negative quirk, it would be the key system and hub which is not entirely user-friendly, and does become a bit of a hassle when transversing from stage-to-stage. Otherwise, it is a fun experience and I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys a challenging 2D platformer.			"

												Yet another new Indie precision platformer is born.  Dustforce reminds me of the days of Shinobi 3, and a few other platformers with ninja-like moves.  It's got tight controls, and will keep you repeating levels to get a higher score worthy enough to be in the top of the leaderboards.  Higher scores also give you more keys to open new, harder levels.  The best things I like about this game is the ambient chill soundtrack - which I haven't heard in a game for a long time - and the ability to playback the videos of any player from the leaderboard.  This should help first-timers understand the game system and best lines when tackling the stages.  Highly recommended for above-average skilled platform gamers only.			"

												I'm not a huge fan of the rebalance they did early on, but I can understand why they changed the level select/portal system. As far as speed run games go, my experience is pretty limited, but I really like Dustforce. The art and music work well with the game and I highly recommend playing with a controller (I used a Xbox 360 controller).			"

												Certainly one of the most challenging games I've ever played. When you spend 2+ hours on one level you really have to think how good this game is. It wasn't super frustrating each time I died either. I just looked forward to getting better at the challenges. I didn't do the difficult levels (after all 16 super keys were collected). Maybe one day I'll have the time for that.			"

												~~My first review~~  Let me first explain my negative review. Ultimately, I wouldn't recommend this game to myself. Rather, I would recommend Dustforce to masochists, personal enemies, and professional platform gamers. I really wanted to like Dustforce. The promo videos made it seem like one casually 'ninjas' and floats about beautiful 16 bit levels collecting cobwebs like Sonic collects rings. Not quite. The concept itself is interesting. The goal is to travel through obstical courses as fast as possible. Along the way, you must run through patches of dust and hit ""enemies"" in order to clear the level. This is a 2D speed-running game.  The physics and mechanics make absolutely no sense to the uninitiated casual game playing plebian like myself. It can be frustrating, repetative and time consuming simply jumping from platform to platform in the overworld. This is where you wander around finding doors to unlock, which represent individual levels. Compare with titles like Super Meat Boy and Cave Story. These games present challenging and interesting game play, while having control schemes and movement that are predictable and intuitive. Dustforce DX creates simple levels, that are made challenging by a character that is difficult to control. Essentially, they took a relatively simple concept and made it difficult to enjoy on account of sloppy, tendinitis aggravating controls that are frustrating to learn and maddening to master. Further, the actual levels are fairly uninteresting and easy to get through. The challenge is that in order to properly complete a level, simply getting through it is not enough. You need to get the fastest time possible without missing any dust. This means repeating levels until you have every move perfected. This ends up being more busy work than anything else. You could easily spend a thousand hours trying to perfect each level. Combined with controls that assault your hands, it can be a very unforgiving process of which I quickly grew tired. I suppose in the Genre of repetitive games which slap you around and demand perfection it succeeds. However, I guess I'm not a fan of games where developers decided the best way to make a game challenging is to make the character barely controllable. I feel like back in the days of original 8 bit graphic platformers, this would simply be called bad controls and it would be relegated to 2 and 3 star reviews. These days there are gamers who specifically enjoy and excel at games with lousy controls, and I suspect if you're one of those people you will find a lot of fun in spending countless hours punishing yourself on Dustforce.  Recall the viral flash game where the object is to control a sprinters limbs to push him over the finish line, or rather see how far you can comically stumble and hobble across a track. This is the same concept taken to it's inevitable extreme... OK, it's not THAT bad, but you'll be spending a half hour trying to jump onto a ledge just to get to another stage... only to discover that you don't have the key to unlock it. Oh right, keys. In order to unlock all the levels, you will need to complete the stages with perfect scores to accumulate keys. Ugh. Summary; If you are considering using the standard keyboard layout, either get an ice pack for your hands or forget about it. The game is barely playable on a game-pad, which is far superior to the keyboard controls. If you're a demi-god with spaghetti fingers and the ability to pick up outrageous controls, and have a lot of time and patience, I guess you will LOVE this game. If you're a casual gamer who likes simple controls, and doesn't want to invest the hours it will take to teach your hands to waltz like noodles through endlessly repetitive levels of dust ninja then get Super Meat Boy instead.

												I have a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of hours in this game, so there may or may not be a hint of bias here.I ♥♥♥♥ing love Dustforce. Probably the biggest challenge, aside from the hardest levels in this game, is getting the hang of the controls. It takes a special amount of dedication to truly master the techniques and proper methods to control your character. I played the game for a pretty decent amount of time (10 or more hours?) and I kind of stopped playing at a certain point. It wasn't until I came back into the game that I found a control scheme that actually worked for me, and went on to complete most of the levels in their entirety. Fast forward to the time I wrote this review and I have over 400 hours put into the game. Oops.So you're probably wondering ""Bbop, how the hell did you manage to get 400+ hours into this game and never truly 100% beat the game?"" Well, to tell the truth, most of my hours spent on this game doesn't even come from playing the main levels.atlas.dustforce.com gives you a massive archive of user-created levels. I've also spent a LOT of time creating my own levels! I would recommend checking my stuff out whenever you get the chance. ;)Dustforce might just have some of the best level-editing tools a platformer could ever give you. I know this because I've spent about as much time making Dustforce maps as I have playing them.Also time-attacking both custom and vanilla maps is addicting as hell, since every map in the game AND every map that gets published on the Atlas has their own leaderboard. The best part about the leaderboards is that they save replays of each run so you get so see how the game's most dedicated players got such amazing times.So yeah, is it the best platformer ever? I would say no - I honestly have no idea - but it is surely the most addicting one I've ever played. Atlas gives Dustforce a near-infinite amount of replayability, whether you like designing levels or playing and reviewing them... or both. o_oWow I can't believe I wrote a review this long. Most of my reccomendations are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ jokes, but there you go.			"

												I did not know what to expect when I started this game. But I can say that I was pleasantly surprised. Within Dustforce DX is some of the most precise, well-constructed 2D platforming that you can experience. Its unique concept and fair set-up allows you to enjoy the game, no matter what your skill level. This is especially true provided the time and score system. If I were to provide a negative quirk, it would be the key system and hub which is not entirely user-friendly, and does become a bit of a hassle when transversing from stage-to-stage. Otherwise, it is a fun experience and I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys a challenging 2D platformer.			"

												Yet another new Indie precision platformer is born.  Dustforce reminds me of the days of Shinobi 3, and a few other platformers with ninja-like moves.  It's got tight controls, and will keep you repeating levels to get a higher score worthy enough to be in the top of the leaderboards.  Higher scores also give you more keys to open new, harder levels.  The best things I like about this game is the ambient chill soundtrack - which I haven't heard in a game for a long time - and the ability to playback the videos of any player from the leaderboard.  This should help first-timers understand the game system and best lines when tackling the stages.  Highly recommended for above-average skilled platform gamers only.			"

												Great game, at first it may seem simple or easy, but the harder levels will make you want to tear your hair out trying to get that SS score. Great feature is that you can watch the runs of other players if you want to find an efficient way to beat a difficult part.Once you get a hang of the controlls, (I reccomend a game pad), the game is amazing and the sountrack and visuals are very chill, which helps because as I said it can get frustrating to make it through an entire level only to hit that spike right before the last piece of dust.

												This game is beautiful. I often get utterly lost in it and forget that I'm playing a game. The soundtrack consistently completely engrosses me. The gameplay is so enjoyable throughout the game. The visual aesthetic is absolutely wonderful. The overworld is designed perfectly for easing players into the more advanced levels, although in the DX update, it's much harder to unlock the harder levels. Every level, despite most using one of four visual styles, is very memorable. Now: a quick warning. This game can eat up a ton of time on a few levels as the hard levels are very hard. I have almost no background in platforming, so maybe i just suck, but I still can't beat Backup Shift. Be prepared for very exact platforming.This game is basically perfect. Even any glitches are just really cool. Get it, people.			"

												If you like a challenge, this is a game for you. The levels start off easy to get you used to the controls but they ramp up in difficulty quickly. But the best part is that it's all fair. No random disappearing blocks, falling spikes or anything of the sort. If you mess up, it's all on you. You'll find yourself grinding a hard level for hours to get SS rank without it really feeling like a grind and it'll all be worth it when you get it.There's also a level editor with a huge amount of user created levels on the Atlas in case you want more challenges and neat ideas you wouldn't see in the stock levels.One of my favourite features though is the leaderboard/replay system. Every run automatically gets recorded and uploaded to the boards so you can view anyone's run at any time (as long as you have an internet connection of course). No need to wonder how the world record got such a crazy time, you can just view it yourself! It really pushes you to improve yourself and compete with your friends.You can easily put in a lot of hours so it's an absolute bargain for the price, especially since it regularly goes on a deep sale.

												Dustforce is one of those games that easily falls under the category of art. The game already excels as a platformer with challenging gameplay and tight controls. But the game becomes an experience when combined with simple, yet stunning visuals and a soundtrack that is relaxing, yet energizing and beautiful.			"

												Easily one of the best precision platformers ever created.Not only are the controls tight and responsive, the visuals are amazing AND the soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard. There are replays and leaderboards for every level, so you can study and learn from the best players as you learn/discover some of the more advanced maneuvers. Sure, the difficulty may not appeal to everyone, but if you are a fan of difficult platformers; do yourself a favor and sink some hours into this gem.			"

												A crazy game with crazy ideas and difficult gameplay.The visual is simple but good and the soundtrack is quite good for platformers games.If you like Super Meat Boy or any difficult platformers, then this game is for you. If not, just look for other kinds of platformer games.			"

												I'm a little biased because I just got the achievement, but this really is one of the best platformers EVER made, and such a good game either to relax into or to enjoy in-depth. Wonderful level design, deep mechanics, and an active community mean you're almost never going to run out of things to do with this game, whether you want to shoot for a good time or just play whatever levels you want.

												I'm keeping this simple, if you like platformers that have a good sense of flow, this game is for you. It's easy to pick up yet difficult to master, as any good game should be. As an added bonus, the soundtrack is excellent and certainly contributes to the overall sense of flow you get from this game.			"

												This game is beautiful. I often get utterly lost in it and forget that I'm playing a game. The soundtrack consistently completely engrosses me. The gameplay is so enjoyable throughout the game. The visual aesthetic is absolutely wonderful. The overworld is designed perfectly for easing players into the more advanced levels, although in the DX update, it's much harder to unlock the harder levels. Every level, despite most using one of four visual styles, is very memorable. Now: a quick warning. This game can eat up a ton of time on a few levels as the hard levels are very hard. I have almost no background in platforming, so maybe i just suck, but I still can't beat Backup Shift. Be prepared for very exact platforming.This game is basically perfect. Even any glitches are just really cool. Get it, people.			"

												If you like a challenge, this is a game for you. The levels start off easy to get you used to the controls but they ramp up in difficulty quickly. But the best part is that it's all fair. No random disappearing blocks, falling spikes or anything of the sort. If you mess up, it's all on you. You'll find yourself grinding a hard level for hours to get SS rank without it really feeling like a grind and it'll all be worth it when you get it.There's also a level editor with a huge amount of user created levels on the Atlas in case you want more challenges and neat ideas you wouldn't see in the stock levels.One of my favourite features though is the leaderboard/replay system. Every run automatically gets recorded and uploaded to the boards so you can view anyone's run at any time (as long as you have an internet connection of course). No need to wonder how the world record got such a crazy time, you can just view it yourself! It really pushes you to improve yourself and compete with your friends.You can easily put in a lot of hours so it's an absolute bargain for the price, especially since it regularly goes on a deep sale.

												I love this game to death, but it's frankly kind of hard to recommend to a lot of people. It's definitely for those who want to MASTER a game. It's a speed runner's dream. It gets hard as hell eventually, but I've found that with enough practice I've done what I thought was impossible. The soundtrack is pure distilled chilled love. The feeling of control in this game is pretty weird. I want to say they're fluid, but it has a handful of quirks, I've played enough of the game that I don't notice any more. If you want a platforming challenge, get Dustforce. It feels great when you get the flow of it.			"

												Pues a este juego le doy... un 8. Es un muy buen platformer y tiene excelente soundtrack, pero algunas veces los controles no son taaaaan precisos como los escenarios lo requieren, y además sí tiene una dificultad muy grande para aquellos que apenas van empezando, no es recomendable para los que buscan alguna experiencia un poco casual, ya que sí requiere mucha práctica para poder estarlo pasando al 100% y puede llegar a ser un poco frustrante. De ahí en más, la idea es original y concuerda con la música.			"

												I was first introduced to the game by a pro League of Legends player, Aphromoo. Very fun game, one of the best platformers I've ever played. Soundtrack is fantastic. Took around 30 mins to get down some of the basic mechanics like wall running. It has alot of gameplay value which can make you go back to the game over and over again!			"

												What a cool little game. It's a runner-platformer where you have to reach the end of the stage cleaning all sorts of dirt/slime/dust in the way. The animation is VERY well done and the level design is great to put all of your ninja/dusting skills into use. The soundtrack is noteworthy as well. I just didn't notice any difference between the 4 cleaners (if there's any at all) and there's not too many levels, though there's a level editor if you feel like giving it a shot. I recommend playing it with a controller, but you will have to manually map it in the options menu. If you don't want to, you can enjoy it with the keyboard as well, the controls are very responsive.

												~~My first review~~  Let me first explain my negative review. Ultimately, I wouldn't recommend this game to myself. Rather, I would recommend Dustforce to masochists, personal enemies, and professional platform gamers. I really wanted to like Dustforce. The promo videos made it seem like one casually 'ninjas' and floats about beautiful 16 bit levels collecting cobwebs like Sonic collects rings. Not quite. The concept itself is interesting. The goal is to travel through obstical courses as fast as possible. Along the way, you must run through patches of dust and hit ""enemies"" in order to clear the level. This is a 2D speed-running game.  The physics and mechanics make absolutely no sense to the uninitiated casual game playing plebian like myself. It can be frustrating, repetative and time consuming simply jumping from platform to platform in the overworld. This is where you wander around finding doors to unlock, which represent individual levels. Compare with titles like Super Meat Boy and Cave Story. These games present challenging and interesting game play, while having control schemes and movement that are predictable and intuitive. Dustforce DX creates simple levels, that are made challenging by a character that is difficult to control. Essentially, they took a relatively simple concept and made it difficult to enjoy on account of sloppy, tendinitis aggravating controls that are frustrating to learn and maddening to master. Further, the actual levels are fairly uninteresting and easy to get through. The challenge is that in order to properly complete a level, simply getting through it is not enough. You need to get the fastest time possible without missing any dust. This means repeating levels until you have every move perfected. This ends up being more busy work than anything else. You could easily spend a thousand hours trying to perfect each level. Combined with controls that assault your hands, it can be a very unforgiving process of which I quickly grew tired. I suppose in the Genre of repetitive games which slap you around and demand perfection it succeeds. However, I guess I'm not a fan of games where developers decided the best way to make a game challenging is to make the character barely controllable. I feel like back in the days of original 8 bit graphic platformers, this would simply be called bad controls and it would be relegated to 2 and 3 star reviews. These days there are gamers who specifically enjoy and excel at games with lousy controls, and I suspect if you're one of those people you will find a lot of fun in spending countless hours punishing yourself on Dustforce.  Recall the viral flash game where the object is to control a sprinters limbs to push him over the finish line, or rather see how far you can comically stumble and hobble across a track. This is the same concept taken to it's inevitable extreme... OK, it's not THAT bad, but you'll be spending a half hour trying to jump onto a ledge just to get to another stage... only to discover that you don't have the key to unlock it. Oh right, keys. In order to unlock all the levels, you will need to complete the stages with perfect scores to accumulate keys. Ugh. Summary; If you are considering using the standard keyboard layout, either get an ice pack for your hands or forget about it. The game is barely playable on a game-pad, which is far superior to the keyboard controls. If you're a demi-god with spaghetti fingers and the ability to pick up outrageous controls, and have a lot of time and patience, I guess you will LOVE this game. If you're a casual gamer who likes simple controls, and doesn't want to invest the hours it will take to teach your hands to waltz like noodles through endlessly repetitive levels of dust ninja then get Super Meat Boy instead.
