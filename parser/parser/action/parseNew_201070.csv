												There is a certain poetry to even the worst videogame. A game like Rogue Warrior or Bad Rats is still entertaining in the same way that watching an automobile accident is entertaining, it's a ""my goodness, just look at this"" sort of spectacle. It draws you in, compels you to watch, and in doing so it keeps you entertained. There is value, however little, in that. After all, what is a game's purpose if not to entertain?  There is another type of game, however, one that doesn't sink so low as to become ""so bad it's good"", nor does it rise high enough to become decent, or even mediocre. It commits the worst kind of media sin: It is boring. Revelations 2012 isn't terrible in the way that Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing is terrible. Revelations has interesting environments (the jungle setting is fairly well detailed and is a nice change of pace from most shooters), the weapons are ok (the shotgun analog weapon is particularly fun to shoot, especially when you get the powerup that increases your rate of fire), and being a Source Engine game it runs fairly well even when it throws a huge amount of enemies onto your screen. The problem is that Revelations 2012 is boring. I recently played a three player co-op game of Revelations 2012. Even after we were able to jump over the technical hurdles required to get the game running, there was that initial ""hey, we're in co-op, talking to each other while we're shooting at enemies, cool"" excited feeling, but that very quickly settled into thoughts of ""why are we doing this?"". We just sort of lost our drive to continue.  I have around 70GB of video recorded of the game session, and I am really having a very difficult time coming up with the motivation required to edit it. Much of the footage is the three of us just running around shooting at enemies. There wasn't a lot to talk about once you mentioned the basics, because you can mention everything of interest in Revelations 2012 in about 15 seconds.  If playing Bad Rats is the equivalent of watching Troll 2, than Revelations 2012 is the equivalent of watching four hours of uneventful city hall budget meetings on public access.			"

												Revelations 2012; a game whose whole premise apparently, is the Apocalypse event on 2012. Sounds fun no? I mean, it should, it's the Apocalypse!!!But the apocalypse never came IRL, so that novelty is not anymore on this game.So... what could it make it better then? If we leave the plot aside?Perhaps good gameplay! Good graphics! Interesting sound assets! Interesting enemies, interesting weapon variety, good game stability, etc...And that's where this thing falls off, because this game in particular failed on most if not all of those essential assets.Yeah I can forgive a lazy plot or perhaps, lackluster graphics, but it's hard to forgive what a game is about, gameplay, enemies, assets in general, etc...This game follows a similar style shown in Valve's Left4Dead2, where you're spawned with 3 other players fighting your way through the enemy forces.As with LF4D2, if you're not teamed up with friends, an AI player will take place of your friends... except that those AI players aren't really good at their duty and fail to do basic tasks, dying often, failing to pick up stuff, etc... leaving you most of the time, if you're not careful, 1 vs all.Well... then you can play with friends, right? Sounds fun after all...However... then it comes another aspect of gameplay, what you use to destroy enemies? The game gives you one weapon, BUT! It can change shape & form and act as a different one, albeit it's still the same looking weapon (With different color). Yet, unfortunately, the weapons feel blands and the assets of it don't follow throught the premise. Say, the sound doesn't fit the weapons and make it feel like you're shooting a cardboard or something weak.YET! The effect the weapons have on the enemies is kinda neat, like enemies vaporizing or being dismembered, stuff like that it's nice to see; sadly on this, is that the path between you shooting and the projectile hitting the enemy is, weird, since the effects of the projectiles don't show up very well on the enemies, making it hard to see if you're hurting them badly until they die.The enemies? Dozen of crazy maniacs, you can say, as they do 'alot' of nonsensical stuff around the environment, apart from just rushing at you, dying tragically (If you are competent) in the process.The maps feature some traps every so and then that are hardly told they are there, sometimes even surprising you with fast deaths, or just simply, there are too many obstacles than needed.Traps... you get it? If your AI partners aren't smart, they will fall into them often, and almost always. Which sadly, this time is true. Althought I've encountered they did that often, sometimes I managed to make them to not to, (Or I just speed through those)Speaking about your partners, they don't have interesting personalities at all, unlike LF4D2. They look and act like generic sidekicks that you don't end up liking or caring about (Which should be the opposite).What about the graphics? Well, let's just say that it looks like a late PS2 game, or at most, an early PS3 game, in graphics, of course.Pixelation, low polygon assets, even the characters are bland, don't really help to boost the already lack of value the other stuff have been getting.Again, bad graphics aren't the sign of a bad game (Often), but in this case, graphics affect the game to give a lesser experience on the player (As it's a FPS game, graphics usually matter most)The campaign can last quite a bit, my playthrought lasted more as I often go around and do lazy stuff, yet I can assure that the story is forgettable and, at most, boring.Fortunately it have more content in form of coop modes and competitive modes. The most redeeming of them is the Battleground modes, that is sort of a Dota mode where players have to take down the enemy structures and are in charge of ""minions"" that are to be used in the feat, eventually entering the enemy base and defeating a boss.Unlike dota or any other ARTS, players can order the minions to stay in certain areas, to defend or w/e.Unfortunately the AI of those is lacking in many aspects, and often fail to do the task assigned to, sometimes even making the battle to be turned into a mess or just fail horribly.Many of the bugs to date have been fixed, yet those who stay still make the game 'not very good'.Now, the price is really low, is it still worth your time? I would love to say yes, since it's cheap, but not often price would give you the quality for your time. This time around, this game offers little for your time, and it's mostly to be avoided. It's broken in the core mechanics, boring, bad assets, stuff like that, that just make it a bad idea to stay with.If you play it you'll see what I mean, or you can just watch videos on youtube about the gameIf I'd give a score to this game, it would be 3/10. While it (Had) a somewhat interesting idea, the way it's implemented it's flawed and made the game fail horribly.You can try it out if you want, but personally I won't play more with this game.~Sjru			"

												My brother ended up winning four copies of this game during some summer/winter sale a couple of years back. He insisted that I play with him and our crew. The problem is that the three of them played it once when I was at work and never played it again for some mysterious reason. I finally put this thing on my computer and found out the reason they never touched this game again: this game is abysmal in every category. You start the game out with three other players , but this game came out two years ago, i.e. more than enough time for people to try the game out and decide that they've had enough of it, so you'll probably end up playing the single player version of the game with your teammates being played as bots. Your choices are a noble hick, a British historian, or two hot chicks. You illustrious four have been warped from wherever the heck you were to some part of Central America by a Mayan priest, have been given futuristic weapons and armor (which he states were worshipped by the Mayans) and you must stop the 2012 apocalypse from happening by essentially murdering the Mayan people. Or at least I think that's what happens. I kind of stopped playing after half an hour and have no intention of continuing whatsoever. The concept is a lot like the Left 4 Dead games (four players slaying a swarm of enemies), but the gameplay is very much along the lines of Painkiller (swarm of enemies with limited weapons and powerups to kill them in a very linear area). The only difference is that Painkiller and the Left 4 Dead games all have very well written stories, interesting characters, professional voice acting and superb graphics, whereas Revelations 2012 has none of that. The story sucks, the voice acting is laughable at times and the gameplay is boring and intellectually devoid. Skipping over such trivialities as the PLOT or the DIALOGUE to get straight to the action can be a good thing, as the Unreal Tournament series has so often shown us, but the gameplay in this one justifies nothing. And the graphics, ZOMG the graphics! The graphics look like they were made by a two man independent development team from a third world country who were trying to make a video game where all the characters have vision problems...for the SEGA SATURN!!! I usually don't dwell on the graphics of the game so long as every other aspect of the game is amazing, but the graphics of Revelations 2012 deserve a special whistleblowing.   In conclusion, you want to stay the hell away from this game. I was literally given a copy of it completely free of charge and I still feel like I've been cheated. I doesn't matter if the game is only $2.49, no price is low enough to blemish your STEAM account or your hard drive with this genital sore equivalent. If you want a four person game where you run around and kill stuff, play Left 4 Dead. If you want a game with a Latino presence, play any of the Tropico games, Grim Fandago, Black Ops II, or hell, play as the token latino guy in any of the Rainbow Six games. Even that will be more culturally enriching than this abomination. You may think that I'm not warranted to speak about this game having only played a half hour of it, but just trust me on this one, okay? This isn't about me being right, even though I am. I'm looking out for YOU.   In fact, let me show you something. Scroll up a bit on this page. See the one critique listed by Valid Gaming? Click on the hyperlink ""valid gaming"". It took you to a web domain that no longer exists, didn't it? Want to know why? Valid Gaming:a.) didn't know what the hell they were talking about and because of that was ignored until they were forced to quit. b.) was Dark(f)artz Entertainment secretly inventing a publication that would actually give their game a thumbs up.or c.) was purged from existence by the powers that be for supporting this game. You decide! Any way you slice it, this game is cursed.			"

												You're the type of gamer who enjoyed numerous hours of Left 4 Dead 1 & 2 and now looking for something different but similar at the same time. To you Revelations 2012 seems like an alternative! But beware! 2012 might not be the year the world ended as predicted by the Mayans but your computer's life might end if you install this game... If you're in desperate need for revelations in life you will find one in this game : it is the worst Left 4 Dead clone ever made! But saying that is not enough! It is just the worst game of 2012.Now does this sounds like a REVELATION to you?Rating:2.0			"

												I arrive to the main menu, and discover it's a shooter with online coop. My ""Hmmm"" glands tingle, surely nobody would go to all this trouble for a joke game.Only then I started a proper level and get a faceful of ♥♥♥♥♥♥...everything. I go to change the controls and encounter that distinctive Source engine style, with controls for ""Spray tag"". After playing a bit more, I notice the bad guys have some familiar animations, the ammo and teammates have a coloured outline through walls and with the revive UI it hits me: it's a Left 4 Dead mod. And by L4D mod I mean monkeys puking into typewriters writing the story, voice acting composed of woman moaning ♥♥♥♥♥♥ically and a general ♥♥♥♥♥♥ness that defies expectations.

They can't say anything like ""It was on greenlight and the public voted for it, so that means it's the public's fault."" The only reason that this game was put onto Steam was because it was made in the source engine, yeah, imagine if you made the worst game ever, put no amount of effort into a game, most people would say that it's terrible, but Valve/Steam would accept it because it was made with their engine, but the trouble is, you can't, because Dark Arz Entertainment beat you to it.If you can't tell by the screenshots, this is a clone of Left 4 Dead but is set in what was supposed to be the year when the world ended, as predicted by the Aztecs. Now, that doesn't sound like a too bad a concept but it's the execution and the laziness of the whole game here in general.You all know that the source engine gives off good graphics and are the type of graphics that will still live up to any day, as shown by games like Half-Life 2, Left 4 Dead and Garry's Mod. The graphics in Revelations 2012 look like the were done in the earliest version of Source engine, I'm talking the original Half-Life's graphics. If you're saying ""they used an older version"" because they didn't, the setup of the game is done in the Half-Life 2 and Left 4 Dead style, so there's no excuse for the game to look this bad.The gameplay is marginally the same as Left 4 Dead but add in some unresponsive controls, unneccesary controls that overlap the necessary controls so the game doesn't know which action you want to perform so it's madatory that you rebind the keys before playing. The most handiest key in this game is Alt+F4. They also somehow manage to take the once addicting gameplay of Left 4 Dead and make it boring with no AI director so you're experiencing the same thing over and over again.The sound is also terrible. Imagine the horrible sound of a guy throwing up his lunch into a bugle horn, proceeding to make a sound out of it and then proceeding to throw up into a trombone and playing them both simulatenously. The sound in this game is unbareable to listen to.Revelations is a chunk of boring mess, cobbled together with bad graphics, disgusting sounds and taking a beloved engine and abusing the hell out of how it's used, get a grip Valve, don't make yourselves grow a boner just because someone else is using your engine. Actually ply the games yourself and see what they're like or stick it on greenlight and hide behind someone else.Pros+ NothingCons- Bad graphics- Unbearable sound- Misuse of an engine- Boring gameplay- RepetitiveFinal verdict: 1/10Steam Curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews "

												This game isn't next gen, high res and GOTYE quality but it has a charm of its own. It's a re-skin of Left 4 Dead with its own enemies and lore. Sure it's not 'good' by most people standards but if you want to point and shoot, game with friends while not spending too much then this is an intresting little game.A few game bugs, though.It's good for the price.

												Tl;dr: Avoid this like the plague. It will break into your house and♥♥♥♥♥♥your family. Otherwise, read below.I bought this game during the summer sale for less than $2 as an impulse purchase and out of curiosity (what the hell, it's 2012). However, what I didn't realize is when the Mayans predicted an apcolypse this year, they may have been talking about this game.First off, I should have known something was up when AVG detected the exe of this abomination as a virus. Sure, AVG gets lot's of false positives, but it's ironic that even it could tell that this game is a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥Basically, it's a glorified Left 4 Dead 2 mod with more Mayans, less zombies, and less fun. It uses the same engine and the ""developers"" didn't even bother to change the user interface, apart from some aesthetics (font).I can find freely downloadable mods that are better than this piece of crap; what gives these guys the rights to charge for it?I'm honestly surprised Valve didn't sue the creators for violating their intellectual property rights; maybe they would've if the game itself wasn't such a joke. Still funny that they were somehow allowed to sell on Steam while other, better Left 4 Dead mods are free and of better quality.The game, level, and character design is a joke. The AI is the same as in Left 4 Dead, only worse. Your team will stand in traps and get themselves killed. Weapons are too weak and enemies deal too much damage, even on normal.Some of the developers have profiles on Steam, and haven't even completed the game or got all of the achievements. That's how much this sucks.So yeah, shame on me for not researching before buying. At least I only lost a couple of cokes from a vending machine...I feel sorry for the people who paid the full $10 for something that really should never have been sold on Steam at all (shame on Valve for that).

												This HAS to be the WORST game in my library.First of all, this is a Left 4 Dead rip off. Left 4 Dead was fantastic. This is not.Each character is some bland emotionless person who you have no backstory of. They have absolutely no expressions to what is happening. Getting your guts ripped out by poorly animated enemies? Oh who cares! Boulder about to run you over? OH WHO ♥♥♥♥ING CARES! Each of them has the most horrible voice acting I have ever heard. Oh, and these 4 people are just normal human beings. Why just them? Shouldn't there be like millions of humans alive?! There is nothing special about them! They aren't super heroes or such! They are normal human beings!Now for the actual game itself. Right from the start you know you have stepped in♥♥♥♥♥♥once you see the horrifying textures and graphics that look like barely any work was put into them.The enemies are not creepy or menacing at all. The scariest part about them is the effort put into them. They run at you like they are prancing in the meadow and every single one of them says the exact same thing, every single one of them is differant. The levels are poorly designed. You will either be lost with no clue where to go or you might as well just put them in a hallway and tell them to reach the end.The weapons are bad. They are just some laser weapons that go ""PEW PEW"" and that is pretty much it. The ammo system takes like 5 hours to even figure out as ALL the ammo looks almost the same. The differant weapons show no differance at all. They all look almost the same and their secondary attack takes forever to find out.Back to the main characters, the models are just some human in a white suit. Why a white suit? We don't know! It's never explained!The AI is terrible, enemies will be seen running into walls and they will sometimes glitch out and not move.Bosses are annoying cause they all do a set of about 3 moves.Now to the worst part of it all. Content.What content? You are shown SIX levels, each with 4 parts. How many levels do you really get to play? Only half.Oh, and the credits at the end of the third one absolutely seals the deal. They are just a bunch of stock images of mayan temples. They then try to ""Educate"" you on the mayans. The multiplayer VS is hideous. It is pretty much a RTS type thing in which you need to destroy an objective. But it gets REALLY boring, really quick.This game is NOT worth the money. It shouldn't even be on steam. It is by far one of the worst games I have EVER played.			"

												This game doesn't deserve the hate that it gets. Sure, it's a blatant Left 4 Dead ripoff but it's enjoyable and adds some things to the formula such as boss encounters, puzzles and traps. It's thoroughly enjoyable with friends, reviewers solely jumped on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t bandwagon created by people who didn't go into the game with an open mind, they immediately knocked it for being a L4D clone and didn't truly give the game a chance.It's unpolished but it has charm, it feels a lot like older games as well in terms of both weapons and visuals. If you're going to play this game, make sure you have friends to play it with otherwise it will obviously not be as enjoyable just as L4D was.Definitely worth a purchase when it's on sale. Give this game an honest try before you knock it just because that's what the bandwagoners say.			"

												Out of all the first person games I have played, Revelations 2012 handles platforming like no other. Taking a full 180 degree spin from the norm, Revelations 2012 will undoubtedly be the next Megaman 7.  I have honestly never experienced a fully fleshed out platformer as extensive and interesting as this game, and I would strongly recommend it to fans of games like Contra, Super Mario, Bloons Tower Defense, and Nintendogs. The gun progression was as good, if not better, than that of Half Life 2, and the various emotes were witty while still conforming to the setting and lore of the game. Of course, as with any other single player sidescrolling beat-em-up, the most important aspect - the story - must shine. Revelations 2012 takes four explorers through the heart of the Mayan prediction of Apocalypse in a manner that could potentially become a box office hit. All in all, Revelations 2012 was a great experience for me, and I hope to see other games in the future follow in the footsteps of this game.			"

												Words cannot express how incredible this fine game is. The amount of work put into the story alone is worth the retail price. Upon starting up the game you are treated to an amazing intro video to give you an in depth look into the story. I was surprised at the quality of character design and voice acting, definitely well thought out.The level design is also well made, paying attention to core sandbox gameplay and giving the players plenty of choice. The co-op adds to the intensity of the combat and exploration of the lush environments.It's so much fun to fight the hordes of natives and immerse yourself in the thrilling boss battles. I literally could not stop re-playing some of the boss battles. I always had to have more.I can honestly say that Revelations 2012 is one of the best games I've ever played and will continue to play it until the day I die.			"

												This game has been improved and is well worth the price of $2.50. The graphics have been improved, wired gantlet thing is gone from what i have seen, and the ""personalized"" clothing has been replaced with some sort of white and red ""armor"" thing. This is deffinatly a try with friends sort of game and if you have 7$ get the four pack and force them to play it's great fun really and truly i just played the single player so far and have enjoyed it Once again get this game and play with friends.

												A former Yoga instructor(and probably now frat-girl/pornstar),an army officer from every Call of Duty ever,the Angry Video Game Nerd and..Kelly go on a magical journey of discovering Mayan nomenclature and genociding them while they're at it.Does that sound fun? It does!

												One of the few games where I can dance and slide around at the same time!The best possible improvement they could have made with this game is giving the player the ability to permanently dance while still allowing the to slide and also add in the ability to shoot while dancing. The blurry text in the ""Lore"" option isn't that big of an issue, nor are the gross graphics (Because gameplay over graphics right?... That said... The gameplay is worthy of the graphics...)10/10 Would Safety Dance Slide Again.			"

												It's not a bad game, but it's not a good game either.  It's like playing through a movie from Mystery Science Theater 3000.  It's corny and cheesy as heck, it's got terrible special effects, it's got acting so bad that it's good, and it's just so much fun to riff on with a couple of buddies.I will say this, though: there are much, MUCH worse games out there than this one.  Like the War Z.			"

												Great game, had a fantastic time playing with friends. Would definitely recommend if you have 3 friends willing to delve in to the rich lore that this amazing game has to offer. While it delivered a controversial message regarding the treatment of Mexicans, I thought that it was one of the greatest games I had ever played. I can see how this won Game Of The Year back in 2012!!! "

												   ""BRAVEHEART""                                            by                                     Randall Wallace                                       Early Draft                FADE IN:               EXT. THE SCOTTISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY               Epic beauty: cobalt mountains beneath a glowering purple sky                fringed with pink, as if the clouds were a lid too small for                the earth; a cascading landscape of boulders shrouded in                deep green grass; and the blue lochs, reflecting the sky. We                hear a voice, husky, Scottish...                                     VOICE OVER                         I will tell you of William Wallace.               EXT. MACANDREWS FARM - DAY               A farmhouse and a large barn lie nestled in a Scottish valley.                Riding down the roads that lead in from opposite sides are                Scottish noblemen in full regalia: eye-popping tartans,                sparkling chestplates. Even the horses are draped in scarlet.                Behind each nobleman rides a single page boy.                                     VOICE OVER                         Historians from England will say I                          am a liar. But history is written by                          those who have hung heroes.               Another noble rides in from the opposite side. Two more appear                down the road, converging on the barn.                                     VOICE OVER                         The King of Scotland had died without                          a son, and the king of England, a                          cruel pagan known as Edward the                          Longshanks, claimed the throne for                          himself. Scotland’s nobles fought                          him, and fought each other, over the                          crown. So Longshanks invited them to                          talks of truce. No weapons, one page                          only.               The nobles eye each other cautiously, but the truce holds.               They enter the barn, with their pages...               EXT. SCOTTISH FARM - DAY               Nestled in emerald hills are the thatched roof house and                barn and outbuildings of a well-run farm. The farmer, MALCOLM                WALLACE, and his nineteen-year-old son JOHN, both strong,                tough men, are riding away from the farm. They hear hooves                behind them and turn to see a boy riding after them.                                     VOICE OVER                         Among the farmers of that shire was                          Malcolm Wallace, a commoner, with                          his own lands and two sons: John...               We FAVOR JOHN WALLACE, the nineteen-year-old sitting easily                on his horse, beside his father...                                     VOICE OVER                         ...and William.               WILLIAM, a skinny eight-year-old riding bareback, catches up                to his father and older brother.                                     FATHER                         Told ya to stay.                                     WILLIAM                         I finished my chores. Where we goin'?                                     FATHER                         MacAndrews'. He was supposed to visit                          when the truce was over.               They ride on, over the lush hills.               EXT. THE MACANDREWS FARM - DAY               The horses are all gone; the place looks deserted. UP ON THE                HILL we see the three Wallaces, looking down.                                     FATHER                         Stay here.               He means William. He and his elder son spur their horses.               AT THE BARN - DAY               The Wallaces ride up, looking around.                                     FATHER                         MacAndrews!... MacAndrews!?               Malcolm finds a pitchfork, John the woodpile axe...               INT. THE BARN               POV from within as the door opens and a widening block of                sunlight illuminates the dusty shadows. Malcolm and John                Wallace step in, and are shocked to see...               POV THE WALLACES               Hanging from the rafters of the barn are thirty Scottish                noblemen and thirty pages, their faces purple and contorted                by the strangulation hanging, their tongues protruding.               Malcolm stabs the pitchfork into the ground in useless anger;                John still grips the axe as he follows his father through                the hanging bodies of the noblemen to the back row, to see                the one man in commoner's dress, like theirs...                                     FATHER                         MacAndrews.               A SHUFFLE; John spins; William has entered the back door.                                     JOHN                         William! Get out of here!                                     WILLIAM                         Why would MacAndrews make so many                          scarecrows?               Before his father and brother can think of anything to say,                William, with a boy's curiosity, touches the spurred foot of                the hanged noblemen we first saw riding in. It's too solid;                he takes a real look at the face, and suddenly --                                     WILLIAM                         R -- real!!!... Ahhhhhgggg!...               He turns to run, but knocks back into the feet of the hanged                man behind him! In blind panic he darts in another direction,                and runs into another corpse, and another; the hanged men                begin to swing, making it harder for William's father and                older brother to fight their way to him.                                     FATHER                         William! William!               Then, worst of all, William sees the pages, boys like himself,                hanged in a row behind their masters!               Finally his father and brother reach William and hug him                tight. There in the barn, among the swinging bodies of the                hanged nobles, Malcolm Wallace grips his sons.                                     FATHER                         Murderin' English ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.                                                                    CUT TO:               EXT. WALLACE FARMHOUSE - NIGHT               The cottage looks peaceful, the windows glowing yellow into                the night. From outside the house we see John rise and close                the shutters of the kitchen, where men are gathered. We PAN                UP to the upper bedroom window...               INSIDE THAT BEDROOM               Young William is in nightmarish sleep. He mumbles in smothered                terror; he twitches. We see               HIS NIGHTMARE               In the blue-grays of his dream, William stands at the door                of the barn, gazing at the hanged knights.

												This game has elements of Left 4 Dead  w.r.t. to it's interface and some of the game play.  If you play L4D or L4D2   a lot you'll be at home when playing online co-op with three of your friends. The menus are exactly the same. The game is playable; I just hope  there will be a community creating extra maps for the game.  What let the game down for me is  the lack of weapon choice and the overall darkness of the  maps as well as grainy graphics. Even when the graphics were maxed out  it looked like a game from several years ago.  With respect to weapons, what you get is a painkilleresque like weapon that's affixed to your arm.  It's effective, but it would be nice to have some  variety. To recharge health you pick up  the hearts left by   the natives you've killed.  These restore anything from 5 to 15% of your health for each  heart  grabbed.To be honest, I wish I'd waited  until  this game was on a deal despite it's already  relative cheapness.			"

												I've played an entire hour of this horrid game and have come to the relization that it's probably in the running for worst game ever.  Any positive review to this game is either sarcastic or has been written by some one who has taken more then a few blows to the head.  This steam pile has been shameless ripped off of Left 4 dead, (Which was a good game I'd remind you), and crapped out a terrible, terrible, awful, game that can only be apperitated on a lethal dose of black tar herion. To truly understand how terrible this game is, feel free to  look into the face of one of the first enemies you meet, daze at the stoned unblinking expresison that he always, always displays because the creators only programed one facial expression.  You can also listen to the horrible voice acting of the unlikable characters that you are forced to play as using the same method of randomly speaking isn L4D (it's clear that they decided they might go all the way on the ripping off someone elses game).  The story of this torture device disguised as a game is a boring and cliche filled story pulled out of the ""writers'"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, including the mayans (cleverly disguised as aztecs because the writers are racist to long dead civilizations as well as♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and crystal skulls which were no doubt based on the Indiana Jones movie that everyone hated and I assume that the makers of this programed abortion were in the same mind set.  It should be noted that this game is the first ""game"" made by the company Dark Artz Entertainments which is a slur in some third-world contries.  While some game creators start slow in the great race of greatness, Dark Fartz (aren't I a genius) have fallen over, brained themselves on the black top, and killed at least two onlookers.  In 2012, a lot of thick people thought that the world would end, it didn't, but we got revenlations 2012 instead, perhaps that's what the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t prophecy was really warning about, and if that's the case I wish we all were killed.In conclusion, don't buy this game, unless you hate yourself.  Then I can only say cheer up mate, you'll get over her.			"

												No. Just no, I absolutely recommend you take your money elsewhere. I only bought it because it looked so bad I HAD to see for myself just how awful it was. It's great that the developers actually had the drive and resources to release their own game built on top of an engine that is already questionable at best when used by people other than VALVe. I hope one day to release my own game, so they have done more than I have hoped to do. However, that does not excuse them from not taking their time to actually think about if it was a good idea or not and make sure it would be playable before charging the public actual money for it. That said, it is hard to believe anyone could have actually released this game in good faith, but what's done is done.			"
