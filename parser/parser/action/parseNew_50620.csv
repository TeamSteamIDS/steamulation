												The game may show a large amount of mechanical similarity to God of War, that is really where the comparison ends. Darksiders drops you into a post apocalyptic nightmare of a world that is an amazingly organic blend of Heaven, Hell, and the modern world. The game contains many beautifully designed levels that have you running down city streets one moment, and fighting in a Hell spawned cesspool the next, with one flowing beautifully into the other. Character and monster design leave nothing to be desired either, with wonderfully detailed nightmares and angelic warriors coming at you from all sides. This game definitely has the eye candy taken care of.As far as the mechanics go, as I said, think God of War and you've pretty well got the idea. You're going to collect souls in order to level up. You'll learn new skills, get new toys, and those toys will need to be leveled as well. You'll run around unique, artistic maps solving complex puzzles. Combat is largely combo based versus multiple opponents, with multiple weapons to choose from. One of the amusing additions to combat is the ability to use just about anything in the environment as an improvised weapon. Street signs, street lamps, cars, you can use them all as either projectiles or beating implements. When the boss fights come up, you'll be working to beat them down to a context specific cut scene finale. If you enjoyed the GoW's gameplay style, you'll feel right at home here. And honestly, there is something to be said for that. The familiar mechanics mean that there's no time wasted figuring out how the game works, and more time spent actually playing the game.Darksiders can be challenging at times, particularly some of the boss battles but the best advice as always is to persevere and you will find the solution. If you can overcome those minor issues then Darksiders has much to offer with a good storyline, many hours of gameplay, and some of the best action sequences you are likely to see.Though influences from other games are clear to see, Darksiders still manages to excel on its own merits. If you're looking for an action/adventure that will keep you busy for hours then there is no need to look further.			"

												I played this a very long time ago. Still to this day I am stunned at how amazing and underrated this game is. Darksiders can be called many things; most idiots, in fact, will call it a ""God of War rip-off"", a ""Zelda rip-off"" and so much else that no one bothers to call Darksiders... well... ""Darksiders"", even though the game has its uniqueness.  It's like calling Crackdown or Prototype a GTA clone! It has similarities to Zelda and if you're going to take ideas (not rip-off, people! Jeez!) from some franchises, Zelda is certainly one of the best to start with.Alright let's get TL;DR out of the way for you lazy dudes out there ;) TL;DR Darksiders is a Third-Person Character action game that everyone should play. PROS+ Excellent variety in the locations and enemies;+ Interesting story with very good atmosphere and lore;+ Simple (though not easy) but entertaining combat;+ Metroidvania elements  (some may not like this, though) + Very lengthy and decently paced (according to steam, took me about 25-27 hours to finish);+ Hard but satisfying puzzles and platforming elements;+ Open World that doesn't feel empty (there always something interesting every corner);+ Appealing art-style.CONS- Game has pacing issues by the end;- Last boss fight, in my opinion, was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t;- VERY Barebones PC Port (will enter in detail below);- The achievements of this game are bugged and have never been fixed.DETAILED REVIEW STORY Apocalypse is rising, Heaven and Hell are fighting and mankind's totally f*cked in the middle.Also in the middle is YOU: War, one of the 4 mythical horsemen of the apocalypse. You get unfairly accused of screwing up and thus, it's your mission to get into an amazing adventure and fix all this♥♥♥♥♥♥The story is fun to follow through and serves as a nice reason for you to get into the varied locations you're going to get into. GRAPHICS / PC PORT One issue will sit in this particular section: the PC Port.Now... it doesn't run bad! In fact, even my old trusty toaster can run this game! I didn't try to put the disc in the toaster's slot, but I'm pretty sure the game runs well there... and I can eat delicious toasts with butter while playing :)Anyway, the game runs well BUT! There are no graphical options! Well there are some... a whoopingly high amount of video options of...  3: V-Sync, Gamma and Resolution Yeah... moving along. GAMEPLAYBasically what makes Darksiders so good is the gameplay. It's very varied.Sure, you start with a very basic combat focused game with few to no combos at all. But like any game, the gameplay becomes harder and more varied. You'll get a leash to grab high ledges, a powerful Power-Fist sort of gauntlet, a scythe, a portal gun (lmao), etc. This will add depth to the combat AND will add its own puzzles and platforming sections.The puzzles made tear my hair out by the end. Then again, I'm not a very good puzzle game player, though I love puzzle games.You'll also learn new moves/combos with each weapon.With every new object you get, you'll be able to unlock new areas and even in old areas, you will be granted access to some valuable secrets to help you on your journey, if you care enough to go back, that is... This is where the metroidvania elements come into play.There are also a lot of collectibles which are worth your time searching for.  It's not just a gimmick like in Call of Duty :p AUDIO  I. ♥♥♥♥ing. Love. The♥♥♥♥♥♥ Out of this soundtrack! Moving on: the voice acting. It's actually very well done. Voices are either hell-ish or those Gruff McGrufferson type of voices, but they work in the context of the game. Nothing's too cringe-worthy to make me lose interest in the story.The combat is also good thanks to the great sound assets of the weapons and the enemies. CONTROLS The controls for a character action game usually prefer the controller (a game I've been playing recently that applies well to this rule is Alice: Madness Returns), however, I played through the entirety of Darksiders (1 and 2) with the Mouse and Keyboard and I must say he controls are so well done, responsive and properly placed that I had no issues with them. Absolutely no desire to go to a controller.It's sad because the controls are obviously well PC designed but then the graphical options department is almost non-existant. OVERALL  One hell of a game!  (Pun not intended)Seriously, I had no moment where I felt bored. just when every location started feeling dull, a new one TOTALLY different appeared and the game kept doing this over and over. No location felt overdone and this allowed the game to not outstay its welcome.And since nowadays a review can't be taken seriously without a score that abstractly sums story, graphics, audio, gameplay etc. into a number that represents absolutely nothing useful for the consumer, I will rate Darksiders a WorthBuying/10.Oh... right, the score must be pointlessly idiotic, almost forgot :p9/10. Anything below 30€ will get your money's worth. The game goes regularly on sale and reached the ""Under 5€"" mark so, with a bit of patience, you can grab this game dirt cheap; almost like stealing.SHOULD BE ILLEGAL TO STEAL SUCH MASTERPIECES! :p  "

Pros:- Cool Story & Role Play: You're a horeseman who's so strong that you serve as the law, balance,     and order between Heaven, Hell, & Earth.- Awesome Hack & Slash Gameplay: The combat looks great and feels satisfying.- Progression: There's lots of gear, combos, special moves, upgrades, etc. to unlock. - Good graphics, cutscenes, and voice acting.Cons:- Puzzles are required to reach the next area.- Puzzles are required to reach the next boss.- Puzzles are required to reach another puzzle.

												One of my all time favorites.To sum it up, it's an apocalypse Zelda where you explore the mystical land of Detroit as Red Arthas, a.k.a. War.You get touched inappropriately by Vulgrim who is the Genie to your Aladdin, and also by the Watcher who is the Navi to your Link.You mission is to find the president's stolen rubies, restore Satan's nemesis to his older glory and to find the true meaning of Christmas. The usual.			"

												There were moments when I wanted to hate this game. Whenever I had to hold caps lock or hammer the middle mouse button at key moments (yes, it's a console port), whenever I had to dig through menus to reorganise items because I could only have three accessible at a time (YES, it's a CONSOLE PORT), whenever it crashed when I alt-tabbed, whenever while climbing what I thought was ""left"" the game considered to be ""back"" (and so on through all the directions), whenever I missed achievements because of a long-standing bug which was never fixed......and yet...I made it to the end. Why? Some of the puzzles are really satisfying and quite clever. The combat is solid. The world is a nice change from the standard fantasy tropes. There are plenty of collectables, with varied but fair obstacles to getting them.It's far from perfect, but it's well worth playing through.			"

												In 2010, the Earth is going to be hit by some meteorites. These are not just rocks, but the actual armies of Heaven and Hell, ready to fight each other in an epic battle. Mid in the fight, another man falls from the sky: The Apocalyptic Horseman War. He does not fight for any side in the battle, he is just there to keep the balance, but there is one problem. The Horsemen are only allowed to interfere when the 7 seals are broken. And nobody broke them. War gets teleported to the fiery council, who go into court with him because he broke this rule. 


>Wrath of War

He tells them that he has gone to earth because he thought the seals were broken. The fiery council gives him another chance to get rid of his guilt, by killing The Destroyer, the one who started the battle between heaven and hell. So War gets sent back to earth, 100 years after the apocalypse.The gameplay is a typical Hack'n'Slay. War is badassily strong and gets to fight against a lot of enemies at once.

 His sword swings hit many enemies at once, and there are other weapons to be aquired with other abilities. The battles feel good and fluid, the finisher moves are brutal and the blocking/evading works great.But there is more than just fighting. The game provides levels and riddles that make it feel like the result of hot sex between God of War and The Legend of Zelda. The riddles can get really hard at times, but not frustratingly hard, so the game does not get boring.There are a lot of collectibles in the open world, and they also help War, like the Abyssal Armor. There are 10 pieces to find, that are pretty well hidden. If you find all pieces, you get one badass armor.Sadly, the programming is weak at times and lets the game crash from time to time. There are also some bugs, like falling through the ground (happened to me 4 times). Good thing that there are enough checkpoints to make up for such annoying bugs.The grafics like a bit comic-like. The characters look extremely packed with muscles, http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=274593438blood squirts en masse, the bosses are huge and monstrous. The environment is very variable, from the destroyed remains of New York over a forest to a huge desert. The light effects look great and the textures are detailed.Huge, aggressive sounds of orchestral rage are violating your ears in this game. The music fits extremely good with a game where you play as The Apocalyptic Horseman War himself.			"

												I'd started playing this game on several occasions... the first time the game chewed me up and spit me out before the end of the first dungeon... the second time I reached the first Boss, took a hammering a few times and then took a long break... but the story and the gameplay really intruiged me, so I came back a third time and was able to stay the course this time. Despite my earlier misgivings, I had an absolute blast and thoroughly enjoyed playing Darksiders... a few people have said it is an underappreciated game, and I can understand that.The player takes on the role of War, one of the 4 horsemen of the Apocalypse, who has been summoned to earth under the impression that the Apocalypse has begun, but when he arrives he finds that the 7 seals required to summon the horsemen are intact, and that his 3 companions have not been called... moreover the demons and angels have wiped out man and continue to fight in the remains of the Shattered Earth. War is accused of breaking the law and siding with Demons, so he sets out to clear his name.As a Christian, with an interest in endtimes fiction, I personally found the over-arcing story to be very interesting... though I can see that the in-game story could have been so much better than it actually was, perhaps down to publisher's decisions.The game is most often compared to Legend of Zelda, and God of War (with a touch of portal thrown in too)... Having never played either LoZ or GoW I did not find the game to be derivative, except for the portal elements, so that colours my opinion of it. I did find combat to be frustrating at times, and it was this that initially put me off... but restarting a couple of times gave me the chance to become more familiar with the enemies and more experienced at fighting them. There is quite a significant degree of button mashing, but no amount of hammering on the same keys will keep you alive unless you learn to survive against some of the nastier enemies. The game does have some of the best boss and mini-boss battles of any game I have played, with particular favourites being: The Jailer; The Griever; An Ashworm; The Stygian; The Broodmother and The Destroyer, to name a few.On the down side there is a lot to get through between boss battles... with travelling through areas between the main hub and the dungeon, then completing the relevant dungeon including numerous tough enemies and a few nosses (not bosses) and mini-bosses... to finally face the dungeon's boss. Also, the dungeons themselves are linear, the puzzles are usually spelled out for you by means of an introductory cut-scene (which I'm used to from the tombs in Assassin's Creed 2), and they were almost always solvable using the piece of equipment or special skill that you'd just acquired... furthermore you'd often acquire something in the dungeon that would then be the key to fighting the boss. I've played and enjoyed a lot of linear games, so I really don't mind that so much.The voice acting is a bit of a mixture... Mark Hamill is brilliant in the supporting role as The Watcher (simultaneously holding War's leash, and acting as an in-game hint system), while some of the other cast were not as great... a few people have commented that the actor voicing War was especially bad, though I never found him to be quite so... I guess I just accepted War's personality as his portrayal and I certainly never felt his delivery jar me from the game.Another particular highlight for me was when War was able to summon Ruin, his horse, and the couple of big fights that followed... some brilliantly epic gaming in my opinion.

												Very underrated game in my opinion. First of all, there aren't many good slasher games on PC, thus this one is already worth buying it. The graphics is not next gen as it was port from the consoles, but the game still looks nice due to wonderful level designs and pretty character models. The story itself is very interesting to follow, plus there are some collectibles to find - thus  the full game completion will take some 20 hours. I recommend it to everyone who likes action games with giant bosses, lots of puzzles and badass main character.			"

Darksiders is underrated game. Why? I don't know. Many reviewers describe this game as God Of War clone. Even if it's true, I see nothing wrong with that. On that point, are all the shooters clones? Are all games sharing same gameplay mechanics clones? I mean, yeah, it have similar gameplay at it's core, but in my opinion, it's more correct to put this game in that particular subgenre of hack 'n' slash-action-adventures, rather to call it clone.So what is that game about. You can find about the plot in wikipedia or something. In that type of games, the plot plays secondary role (atleast for me). What I want from that type of game is good, solid gameplay. And Darksiders have it. The game's story is decent enough to keeps you playing and thats more than enough for me. The short version: you play as WAR - one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, summoned to restore THE balance between the good and evil.For the most of the time, you hack, slash, climb, pull, shoot, solve puzzles, open chests, fight bosses...What more do you need?The gameplay is solid and polished. The combat and platforming feels and plays fluid. I've had some difficulties with the shooting, but nothing gamebraking. The puzzles are challenging, but not too hard.The art is comic-styled with the typical hyperbolized models of the characters, armors and weapons, which makes the world of Darksiders epic and badass. There are some RPG elements, but nothing special. Collect souls, buy upgrades, movements, gear, etc. The score and voice acting are on decent level, but fits well and helps the game to feel even more epic.So if you love God Of War, Dante's Inferno, Devil May Cry, Prince Of Persia, Legacy of Kain, you will love that one too. It plays right, feels right, looks right, it's a good, solid and polished game.And FFS, people, PLAY IT WITH GAMEPAD! I can't imagine how can you play that sort of games with keyboard and mouse! You will hardly enjoy the game without a proper controller. It's designed to play that way. Some people call it bad port, i call it bad peripheral choice. I've played it on Xbox360 and it plays the same. So nope, not a bad port at all.Had some problems with my Logitech Rumble Pad controler though, but putting x360ce make it work like charm.8.5/10 "

AMAZING GAME WITH NO DLC AND STUFF !!!Ok this one sat in my backlog for a good bit ,so the other day i decided to give it another go and try and finish it. Man this game is so darn good.The story is so good and this one is pretty long also ,but well worth the ride.If you like the battle systems like Devil May Cry or Remember Me give this one a go.The puzzles and action fighting is a good mix and a good challenge.The level designs are amazing and fun and real neat.The fights may be a bit repetitive but still rewarding.The crazy thing this game is pretty long for a game without DLC or addons.Ive been reading many would like to see a Deathinitive Edition or a Warinitive Edition but i say dont fix what isnt broken.The voice acting (Mark Hamill as The Wather) is also real good also so is the music If you dont own this one id say pick it up and if you do blow the dust off it like i did and give it another shot till the end ,im sure you will like it once the full story is told !!Truth i would like to see a movie or cartoon with this game,id go see it :) Amazing story ! Check it out !!			"

												Still looks good thanks to a excellent art direction. I orginally played Darksiders on PS3 but didn't complete it. On the PC, it still looks and plays great. It's not perfect but it absolutey fun to play. I've heard it described as Zelda for grown ups and I think it is an apt comparison. In each section you have to obtain a new weapon or tool that will allow you to proceed to the next area or get back to that one spot you couldn't previously reach. It also has some very simlar weapons/tools such as the hookshot, a boomerang, a shadow world over world. There appears to be a fairly deep combo system but I was ok playing a button masher extravaganza and only learining a couple of the combos. My only negative, which may not be one for some, would be that it overstayed its welcome by just a bit. By the time I was 26 hours in, I was ready to get to the end of the story (which is still pretty good by the way) I would defintily still recommend it and I look forward to playing as War in Darksiders 2. Based upon recent news thre is still a chance that I will get to play as Pestilence and Famine.			"

TL;DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:I got Darksiders because I was interested on the rather unique theme. Once I started playing it, I quickly found myself being oddly familiar, despite being my first playthrough. Then it dawned on me, the game played like other more popular Action Adventure titles such as, but not limited to: God of War, DMC, Zelda, Prince of Persia, Portal etc. At first I was skeptical about the similarities but still found Darksiders to be a fun game in it's own right.PLOT (No Spoilers):War, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse has landed on Earth triggering a full scale conflict between Heaven and Hell which utterly disrupted the precious Balance that dominantly prevailed for eons. Hated by Hell, condemned by Heaven, War now walks the Earth in an attempt to clear his name.PROS:+ Familiar but still Fun Gameplay: -Taking multiple inspirations from other titles, Darksiders takes the best of the best features and aspects of those titles and mashes them up to make a Frankenstein monster type of game which is unique unto itself. This game deserve more attention than what initially got.+ Atmosphere and Sound: -Sound assets are magnificent, scenery are breathtaking and character art are wonderful built. They all come together to make a very immersive and beautiful post-apocalyptic Earth.+ Graphics to Framerate Ratio: -Being a copy paste console port, does leave the game a bit weak in terms of graphical fidelity, poor texture quality, weak special effects and limited animations are blatantly visible but it does benefit older and more outdated PCs. The 1080p support does make it more vivid and sharp than the console counter parts.+ Puzzles: Taking inspiration from the Zelda games, Darksiders does feature a lot of puzzle solving, involving different skill sets and items that the player acquire. The puzzles are simple enough to not be frustrating, yet delivers a certain level of complexity that makes them satisfying to solve.CONS:- Controls: -Being a console port, this game was clearly designed to be played using a gamepad rather than the mouse and keyboard. Attempts were made to integrate it better to Keyboard controls but the player will be left rather frustrated for the most part.- Limited Graphical settings: -This speaks for itself, the game hardly has any options to change graphical fidelity. If you find yourself using a lower-end PC and FPS drops occur, you probably won't be able to do anything about it.- Poor Story and No character progression: -War is not the most likable video game personality you will encounter, the story does not develop on the main protagonist either in personality or traits. He will have the same expression and demeanor from start to finish. As the Fallout games say, ""War never changes.""- Restrictive maps: -Lets make a checklist on what being a Horseman is all about. 1. Have a horse (albiet a bit late in the game but CHECK) 2. You can fight in said horse (CHECK) 3. You have a place to ride your Horse (NOT CHECK). The game gives you one or two maps where riding Ruin (your horse) viable, but other than those maps, you'll find yourself fighting on foot through small and cramped areas not being able to utilize the glory of mounted combat.CONCLUSION:GOOD GAME, it takes the best mechanics of other games and places them into one and making a very fun and enjoyable experience.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Like my Reviews?

												Darksiders is a great action game that combines the hack 'n slash gameplay with a unique and engaging storyline. I confess that at the beginning the game did not hold me, but past the first few hours it became very good, the gameplay is similar to other games in the genre but it has its originality, with good combat mechanics, mixed with clever puzzles. Graphically the game is ok, the sounds that are the highlight with good effects and a great soundtrack, and a flawless voice acting.The plot is another strong point, well worked and unique, which involves aspects of Christianity and has great characters. War, one of the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse and the playable character is without a doubt remarkable and captivating. Although the combat gets better on the joystick, there are many parts where you need to aim and I found difficult when I had to be quick, so I started to play on keyboard + mouse. There also a problem with achievements, I noticed in the middle of the game that some don't unblocked. Other than that, I can only recommend!8/10			"

												I honestly had problems writing this review. With my numerous attempts at writing a decent introduction I found myself thinking about this game much more than I should, considering it is just a dumb, unambitious hack 'n' slash title...I remembered how this game started a series which never reached completion, as THQ's bankruptcy halted all plans for future entries after the second one. Should we be sad about it? I mulled over all those opinions about War's journey being a calque of successful story of Kratos from God of War. How funny is that? There are so many H'n'S games, GoW did not start them nor was it the best game (/series) of this type. I thought how many people will even read this review, considering that everyone who wanted to own Darksiders already has it, either cursing or celebrating it (or maybe doing simply nothing...?).Oh? I accidentally wrote something akin to an introduction. Sweet!At the beginning, I stated that this game is dumb and unambitious. While this is technically true, as the game never overstepped its bounds with its design, there is no reason to label it as ""bad"". Quite the contrary, you can have a lot of fun tearing apart various opponents, searching for hidden treasures and solving environmental puzzles. Just do not expect any narrative depth or involvement with characters. The story is quite straightforward and the big twist is not quite as shocking as it should be, but nothing can be described as cringeworthy, so that's a plus.The combat is enjoyable, especially further in the game when your power grows with every upgrade bought from demon merchant, every weapon added to War's arsenal and every ability found. There is also a decent number of enemy types and bosses to unleash your power on and make 50-or-so combos. Add in some finishers and you should have a satisfying combat system, right? Unfortunately... in practice it falls short sometimes, as it is bit less varied than it could be. You might be a bit disappointed once you realize you can get only 3 melee weapons, 2 ranged and, uh, one horn, for crowd control. The number of possible combinations is really small as well and some of them can be unlocked only after the weapon levels up (yeah, you have to use a weapon to level it up and THEN you buy a new combo or upgrade those you possess). Furthermore, the game does nothing to encourage or award combat variety. You can just stand in one place and spam one technique over and over, you get no points for trying to be stylish. Dodging is also a bit strange, as it seems to be a bit too slow but I suppose it makes sense with War. Just look at some artwork of him!In Darksiders if you are not in combat or exploring (which is really nice, by the way - many nooks and crannies to look into and an ok level design) you are probably solving some puzzles. All of them are quite easy, although you might want to pause for a bit and look around before going for the solution, as in many cases you can find treasure chests or precious artifacts in the puzzle areas, saving you a lot of time you would otherwise have to spend to find that one chest with the awesome armour piece you missed. Quite curiously, many elements of Darksiders - especially puzzles - remind me of the Legend of Zelda series. You go to the dungeon, find a new item, proceed through the dungeon with the help of said item and finally fight a boss... which at some point requires your newly acuired item. Simple and sweet.What I am trying to say through this review is that Darksiders is a simple, decent game. While it might not invest you terribly in War's story, it can help you relax and have some good time. Who knows, maybe you'll want more? The sequel is supposed to be even better and it is always good to start at the beginning.			"

												After almost 20 hours of continuously playing I'm finally done. This has really been that one game, that has finally revived my hunger for actually playing games. Where to start, you start as a warrior named war (hence the pun :D) fighting against 2 factions, heaven and hell to regain balance. As most people I started by reading some reviews, then I stumbled across this one review which said '' please don't play this game on easy, you'll regret as hell'' so I followed his advice, took normal, now that I'm done I highly regret not playing on apocalyptic (hardest difficulty). So please, don't be as foolish as me and play this game on apocalyptic mode and just enjoy it. Now to some pros and consPros:- The story is just amazing IMO, you're a horseman, you're one of the 4 horsemen who serve as the law, balance and order between Hell, Heaven and Earth. I really recommend you see all cutscenes and just follow the story and never miss a shot, cause man you'll regret like hell.- The voice actors are just amazing, the way they talk, how they talk and just everything, there's always something new to expect in each cutscene. - Dialogue is amazing, not just the voice actors.- The best way to put the combat is that it's hack and slash, use combos, any kind of combos you desire, buy, explore and slaughter.- Terrain and environment is good, it ranges from different areas and ''worlds'' to explore, everything from new york (if I'm not mistaken) to huge deserts where hostile threats are yet to be found.- As the game progresses you'll obtain new items, upgrades, special moves, and character upgrades (different tokens, health and wrath)- Creativity is shown, the economy here isn't the typical gold, or dollars, here you deal with 3 different type of souls, money1, wrath2 and health3. Blue1, yellow2 and green3 ( Number behind indicates which colour is for which thing.)- Graphics are good. cutscenes are good, nothing bad which I've noticed- Music is quite good, it fits the situations you're in perfectly, it's basically this Synchronisation that's highly appealing and creates this dramatic effect.Cons:- Game might crash when you alt+tab and enter back to the game, so if you must alt+tab, remember to save right before you do.- too many puzzles at certain times, but look at the bright side, if you like challenges and like to exercise your brain, this will be no con to you.- Some bosses are just too easy, it isn't overwhelmingly easy, but they just don't feel as hard as they should have ( might be cause I played in normal and not apocalyptic, silly me :C)Conclusion: I would just like to say that I had a really good time playing this, at times I got shivers down my neck and goose bumps by the story alone. This is one of the best games I've played in a long while, I got this constant thrill and at times my adrenaline was just soo high. If you are considering on purchasing this, stop hesitating and just buy this. It's really worth it, if you are a tf2 trader, go to market and buy the franchise pack for 5 keys, it's worth every single penny, I promise. that's all I had to say. Personal score 10/10			"

												You don't need to buy anything to enjoy this game. This is one of the last games of an era without dlc's. No online shennanigans either. Just a version 1.1 and that's it. You get the full game, complete, satisfying and quite replayable. The art style and aesthetics is just so good. You don't need realistic graphics to have fun and immerse in the story. Action, puzzle platformer all in one. Heaven / Hell			"

Good graphics.Full voice dialogues, sound effects and nice soundtrack.Easy to learn gameplay, cool moves and combos, awesome boss fights.Interesting special powers and weapons.Not challenging puzzles, but fun to solve them.The story is ok.Boring power-ups and secrets. You need to search same places again and again. It's good to have strategy guides from other users.Free comic and soundtrack with the game. "

												I love the Darksiders franchise, I love Darksiders 2, and I kinda like this game as well, but damn, I haven't played yet a game so good yet so full of bugs and glitches. Let me mention only a few, the ones I faced in 15 hours of gameplay:- the black screen upon first time launching issue - fixable by deleting files from the game installation (the AMD_Logo_movie.wmv file or the options.dopt file)- the steam cloud not working issue - save files have to be manually moved around upon various folders to actually enable the proper use of the ""cloud"" synchronization feature- the game breaking ""twilight cathedral"" crystal sword bug (a ""crystal sword"" needed to progress through the game gets missing and you have to completely restart the chapter, unless you have a proper save);- Steam achievements that should be unlocked might not get unlocked, for unknown reasons. Very often game saves are a must.Furthermore, so far, the boss fights are either too easy (the jailer) or damn straight unfair (Tiamat). On the good side, I don't see that much of a difference between Darksiders 2 and 1, visually speaking. The game looks good, the cutscenes are amazing, the design is well-thought. If you loved Darksiders 2, you won't feel like Darksiders 1 is a downgrade.I loved Darksiders 2 and recommended it with all my heart, but Darksiders 1... hmm... Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed playing it, but I just can't recommend it as it is, without hesitation, with all my heart, in its current form. It's just too flawed.At the moment, after all this struggle with bugs and glitches, this game goes to my ""recommended with a lot of second thoughts"" list.			"

												 Darksiders is a game that piqued my interest several years ago when it first came out. Inspired by a genre I really enjoy but taken in a grittier, and more combat oriented direction. Which sounded like the best of both worlds. For a first outing the games designed at an okay level. At a basic level the game is fun, and functional. Animations are nice, your character is responsive and combat is very rarely unfair. Though that level of fun is drained by decisions both small and large that really inhibit the game from obtaining its true potential. While combat is fun at a basic level, it never really evolves. Basic enemies never challenged me to change my attack plans. Even when mechanics like blocking were added to enemies, launching them still bypassed it, which launching is part of the basic attack string. While in the air you are functionally invulnerable to all but a few basic enemies as well as enemies have no aerial attacks or grabs of any kind and as such they generally waddle in to get hit along side your launched target and die.  There are heavy and miniboss enemies that are littered throughout the game, but they are either forgettable and unchallenging or downright unfair and cheap. The unfair enemies generally have mistimed attacks that don't feel in line with where you should be attempting to parry. This means it takes far more experimentation to find out if an attack is even parriable in the first place, let alone get the timing right. There's also the problem that attacks really aren't intuitive as to whether they're parriable or not. A miniboss with giant exploding flaming hands can be parried, while An overhead slam with an axe from a skeleton is not. The game also has issues with targetting. I seriously believe that if you are making a third person spectacle fighter, you really really need to have a good camera. When focusing on a single enemy the camera zooms in extremely close behind your character, so much so that  you can't keep track of opponents behind you or to the side as well as you should. This means focusing for the most part is not what you want to do, as you will take free damage from enemies that you can no longer see. There's also the problem of what the game decides you want to target. In my opinion hitting the focus button should prioritize the enemy closest to the player first and foremost, then allow you to cycle if you want someone else. This allows the player to quickly swap to the largest threat in their vicinity without the hassle of swapping targets. In the middle of combat I found it frustrating on multiple occasions using my right hand to use the thumbstick to swap between targets. With your right hand also being used to attack jump and evade, there is too much burden placed on you to control both the camera and combat at the same time. Thus I find it very unintuitive. Bosses are for the most part are boring as well. They for the most part have sequences where you have to use a gimmick or tool you obtained in the dungeon to weaken them just to fight them. This is saddening, as fighting them face to face is what's genuinely fun. Not waiting X seconds to throw a bomb to knock the boss to the ground while running around in circles. Some bosses are actually genuinely fun, as they have no gimmicks attached to them, and that is where the game shines. But they are few and far between. For the most part the tools you get are pretty nifty, they are fun to use and modify combat in a genuinely interesting way. With the exception of the horse, it just doesn't fit into the way the game is designed and feels shoehorned. The game has a very claustrophobic closed in feel, where you are progressing through tunnels and buildings, not wide open fields. Where you actually use the horse is in the one area it was designed for. That area is just designed for the horse, there's no reason for it to be so large, except to give the horse a purpose. One that really doesn't mesh with the rest of the game. You can't ride the horse inside, combat on the horse is unwieldy and riding it feels more like driving a tank than a horse. I'm not a fan. The dungeons themselves have a great aesthetic design. I like how they look, I thoroughly enjoyed my time inside each one, as they all have their own flair. But the game, really holds your hand whenever you enter a new room as it forces you into a cutscene that slowly pans from object to object in the order  you have to use them. The puzzles are basic as it is, to also show me where each piece is and the order to use it in turns each room into a really boring series of fetch quests. Grab a bomb from location A, bring it to location B. The writing is mixed as well. While the main character and the only female character fall flat and into generic stereotypes. One being dark and edgy, while the other a perfect example of a damsel in distress. The side characters however are genuinely interesting. For example, the maker you meet called Black Hammer is by far the best character. He is not flat, one dimensional and his entire backstory is not revealed in one sentence. The same can be said of Samael as well. The game could have really shined if it had more development time. At a basic level the game is functional and can be fun if taken in small quantities. Though it gets repetitive really fast, from both a combat, boss and puzzle perspective. If you really enjoy this genre there is fun to be had. Otherwise I would highly recommend the second game in this series or another game series altogether.			"

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.Zelda this, God of War that, Darksiders is in a league of its own!You play as War, one of the four horsemen of apocalypse, as one of the horsemen of the apocalypse you are entrusted with the balance, War is accused of launching the apocalypse an earlier than expected, being innocent and not knowing what happened, you question as to how you are wrongly sentenced to death and offers redemption through defeating the one truly responsible, ""The DestroyerOverall: Darksiders is a great, no an amazing game, it was simply what I wanted my game to be, unoriginal maybe, but still the game was just perfect for me, it also gave hardcore gamers something to look forward to with all of its unlockables and rewards, which was missing in most of the games today and definitely a sore relief from all the shooting games, if you're really into gaming, Darksiders is the game for you.

So save if you need to tab out.-Achievements are broken a fix is to restart steam and then launch it first.In conclusion I highly recommend if you are considering to buy it and do not own a controller that you should buy this game on a sale and with the money you save buy a controller.

												Darksiders is a truly epic and immersive experience. A dark and twisted take on the Biblical Apocalypse, that features an awesome storyline, wrapped into a visually modern hack-and-slash style game, but with many time-tested gameplay mechanics still in place.      The game will take newcomers at least 12 hours to beat, and along the way it delivers a very well distributed amount of great storytelling, hardhitting combat (which has finishing moves that you simply can't get enough of), and challenging puzzles. At no point does one thing or the other become boring, and this might be Darksiders' biggest strength.     It might have been developed for consoles and then ported to PC some time later, but don't let that fool you. The controls are still good, and it doesn't take much time to get used to playing with a keyboard and a mouse. All keys are rebindable.     The game might crash on occasion, so remember to save often. But this is a minor concern, and Darksiders is definitely a game to keep a lookout for during the Steam Sales.			"

												Darksiders is an 3rd person single-player RPG, which contains about 15 hours of gameplay.Many people tend to compare this to God of War, because both games have a bunch of similarities.You play as War, one of the horsemen of the Apocalypse. You are being accused of breaking the truce between Heaven and Hell, and thus bringing doom to all humanity. Your mission is simply put; to find the real culprits.As War, you find yourself travelling through marvelous landscapes, fighting against tougher enemies, exploring dungeons and solving puzzles. These puzzles are designed for older audiences, and in fact, i find that rather amusing. It takes time to figure out what to do, and when to do. You will often be rewarded with souls, mana or health points.Souls can be used to upgrade weapons, learn new combos and to upgrade them as well.Combat is slow-paced, combos aren't hard to master, and enemies are forgiving.You start by only using your sword, Chaoseater, but you gain more weapons and gear throughout the game.Good examples are large scythe called The Harvester, and revolver called Mercy.Art style is maybe the thing i liked the most - it's cartoon-like, uses lots of color, has all these little details like ash floating mid-air, and spider webs hanging out of windows. The artist team sure knew what they did, environment changes from fires of hell to desolate lands, gothic-style manors and terrains crowded with grass and waterfalls.Game sometimes has little frame problems, but those can be simply fixed by changing angle of view.I also had some glitches throughout the game, none of them caused game crashes or anything bad.Overall it's a good game. It looks good and plays good, you're going to enjoy every minute of it.When it ends, you wish it would have not, not so soon. It's so much fun.+ It's available for only 19,99€ on Store, and that, is a bargain.Thanks for reading, hopefully this helped.Constructive criticism appreciated!-Nate			"

												I once wrote in a Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 review that it definitely has the most zealous prologue in video game history. Truth is, there is another game that can dispute this title; that is Darksiders. It literally starts with an apocalypse. And though it isn’t maybe as brilliantly directed as Castlevania’s reboot, but how can you beat such dramatic premise? The judgment day had come; four horsemen of the apocalypse were summoned to the Earth. You play as one of those four — War. He is big. He is muscular. He wields a gigantic sword. He is constantly enraged. And finally, he is voiced by Liam O’Brien, who once told you that you are not prepared, and who always performs like he’s totally♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off and has had a three day lasting constipation. Arriving on Earth our hero finds out that he is alone. That it was all someone’s ruse, because the final seventh seal was not broken. War goes on a series of angsty battles against various demons in pursuit of the one who’s responsible for this, and finally ends up fighting a gigantic boss. And this is the tutorial part, so it’s supposed to be easy, so the protagonist ends up being imprisoned by The Charred Council, mysterious creatures “overseeing the balance” while looking like big stone head statues. He cuts a very shady deal with them for a bit of “detective” work on Earth, finding the deceiver who killed billions of humans and started out a war between angels and demons, lasting more than one hundred years. Yeah, for some reason War has been kept for so long, and now he’s weakened, so good bye, overpowered abilities from the prologue, you won’t see them ‘till you are fully levelled-up and nearly through the game. I hope, at this point you are totally getting that this is a story that says “♥♥♥♥ logic” and bursts out in a series of delirious, bizarre events, that actually are quite entertaining. From the point of style it’s obvious lowbrow; in case you didn’t know game’s creative director was John Madureira, a comic artist best known for his work on Uncanny X-Men series. So, yeah this game is power-fantasy, and it’s filled with testosterone like a gym locker room.A notable thing about this game is, that back in the day, when it was released, it most usually was described as Zelda wrapped up in Warhammer or Warcraft, maybe with the added scent of God of War. And it’s true, of course. But the real game’s sibling was always Castlevania, series which shifted to explorational gameplay being inspired by Zelda. There’s really no point in my nitpicking here, other than an obvious intent to define most of the Zeldas as metroidvanias. So, yeah it has a rich ramified big world filled with puzzles, bosses, minions and secrets (maybe even too big, especially if you talk about those portal section near the end, ugh). And it’s open to explore in virtually any order, but in reality to access certain areas you’d need special abilities or keys and that means sticking to the script, being a good horseman of the apocalypse and going where you are told to. That means, player will rarely be stuck somewhere, and that’s good news, because there's a lot of good stuff. The scope and scale on which Darksiders operate isn’t just big, it’s enormous. What starts as a pretty mediocre one-button-mashing slasher set in though very interesting scenery of post-apocalyptic Earth being torn apart by demons and angels turns out to be much more. Of course, no one would take away your severed heads, buckets of blood, game’s bread and butter, but there’s more to that. Riding a horse, and fighting on a horse (hey, you’re horseman after all)? Check. Shooting stuff with your pistol, with big angelic gun or while riding a gryphon in shoot-em-up section? You got it. And then there’s more and then some.One can argue that game lacks innovation, but at the end of the day it doesn’t matter. Vigil took what they can here and there, but they didn’t lack self-irony and they took it knowing how to use it to create a game that is good entertainment.			"

												I have completed Darksiders three times now. It doesn't really amaze me as a game in any way. The graphics are cartoonish and just about worthy of the Xbox 360 (not a compliment), the gameplay is formulaic and platformy reminiscent of a Playstation 2 game (that's sort of a compliment) and the story-line and script is about as impressive as Michael Bay at his best (not really a compliment either), although having said that its ""twist"" ending keeps things at least a little fresh.Despite all this, to this day I find something in Darksiders simplicity that I like. Maybe it is simply the pleasure in experiencing the humble origins of its overly-ambitious sequel, perhaps it's that typical millenial love of wandering a post-apocalyptic Earth, or maybe it's the playing of a story-line (which will likely never be finished) based on the idea of ageless god-like creatures on a self-serving mission to resurrect the annihilated human race. There is nothing new or groundbreaking about Darksiders, and although it was one of THQ's larger releases it is not at all a game that was made to be a money spinner. Somebody loved Darksiders, and in 2016 I still do. The level design is varied in a predictable sort of way (forest level, desert level, city level, scary level), the bosses which you hunt are quite interesting but again nothing new (giant spider, giant bat) and a lot of the game's completion relies on that obsession with collectibles and point gathering that 2006-2010 games are so infamous for. This game however IS charming. And it did give us the bug-riddled but excellent Darksiders II. If you are a fan of the latter or you think that the Playstation 2 was the best games console to grace God's green Earth, pick up this game.			"

												Just recently finished my run through Darksiders; I must say I was very pleased with the experience.  The game reminded me of a cross between Legend of Zelda and God of War. The plot of the story isn't necessarily anything to write home about, but the actual atmosphere of the game is superb. I found the environments in particular to be highly immersive; each area has its own unique theme. The non-player character models, including their animations, are extraordinary. The combat isn't particularly evolved and the game itself isn't exactly challenging. I personally played on Apocalyptic and would recommend others do the same. There were a surprising amount of puzzles, invariably utilizing some recently acquired gadget. These items are often necessary for collectibles, but rarely are required in areas beyond which they were designed.If I had to summarize my experience with this game I would say this: It starts very strong, but begins to struggle in the end. There are enough ""awesome"" moments that keep you engaged through the ~15 hours but the repetitious challenge/puzzle formula, shallow improvement system, and anticlimactic ending make for a mediocre finish. I still recommend the game. It was quite an enjoyable adventure and I'm looking forward to seeing more of this stylish world in Darksiders II.  "

												Put together an action game, with an adventure based in exploration and dungeon beating, an apocalyptic fantasy setting and the result is one of the most enjoyable games I have played the last few years. The plot is nicely done, though a little confusing, but the characters and mythology are well created. The gameplay and mechanics are easy to learn and the action is very gore, which would feel stereotypical if not for the mix of genres. The only flaws might the graphics (not bad but should have been much better) and some level design (extremely long and annoying dungeons). This is a franchise I would definitely want to keep playing for a long time.			"

												At first glance Darksiders looked to me just like any other 3rd person adventure. In fact in the first level or so there is nothing more to it, but after that the game really picks up and gets interesting. I was mostly drawn in by its great setting that takes place in a post-Armageddon world where both angels and demons deem you as an enemy. The art style and the environments were really beautiful as well, what enhanced the atmosphere. After you've gotten past the first level, that's when your character starts to learn new moves, making combat very fun and engaging. In addition you get some new weapons as well, like the Scythe, for more crowd control, and also a Tremor Gauntlet, if you fancy power punching. Among all the combat, the boss fights especially stood out for me. Each and every boss fight was both challenging and enjoyable at the same time and this is perhaps the game's biggest strength in my opinion. The cool cutscenes and the special kills were an icing on the cake. Although there are so many good things about this game and although I've given it a 9, I also have several criticisms. First of all, the game is not exactly a very good console port. The keyboard and mouse control scheme was more or less playable, but it's the fact that you couldn't change graphics options apart from resolution. Of course this isn't much of a problem for someone with a powerful PC, but for those of us with average machines, even on low resolution there is a noticeable drop in framerate in some areas of the game, making it quite stuttery. Another thing that I disliked - some areas were just a bit too long, like the Hollows and the Ashlands. Not sure whose bright idea it was that the sewers and the desert are good candidates for lengthy levels, since those usually tend to be amongst the most boring of the environments in any game. The Black Throne level was perhaps the biggest offender. Although it was a very beautiful level with some cool battles, it had way too much backtracking and also made you do the same thing 3 times! And my last criticism would be towards the puzzles. Although there were some great puzzles in the game, some others were really annoying. They weren't hard or anything. You could figure out most of them right away. It's just that to execute those solutions usually took too long, requiring too much running and jumping about, as well as tonnes of trial and error, and hence that was breaking the pace of the game. All those criticisms are quite strong for me and I guess if I wasn't so charmed by the game's setting and art style, I probably would've given it an 8 rather than a 9. Overall the game is highly entertaining and worth checking out. Going to be trying out the second one no doubt... Vote 8/10			"

Awesome game, unfortunately, a lot of bugs and a bad port from consolesGame reviewThis game is awesome in: Story: Greatest story about the four horsemen with an strong plot.  Gameplay: Fluid, rapid, alot of action with possibility of upgrading yourself Soundtrack: Very emotional soundtrack. Difficulty: Face a lot enemies and solve numerous puzzles.This game is bad in: Bugs: There's a lot of bug, i will list the known ones. Bad Port: No optimization nor graphics settings. Repetition: Some puzzles may become boring due repetitivenessList of common bugs Crystal Sword: You may get stuck on Twilight Cathedral due a glitch with Crystal Sword, remember to save your game BEFORE getting the swords. There's no fix if you get stuck, only loading your game. Abyssal Armor: You can't start a new game with Abyssal Armor if you exited game after you get it. You should get Abyssal Armor, quit to menu, then start a new game with Abyssal armor, finally save the game. It's the only way to start a new game with Abyssal Armor. Achievements: If you load de the game multiple times in a single session, Steam will stop counting your achievements, the only way to solve this, is running the game in Big Picture, then look on your achievements, if they're displaying 0/0, you have to restart Steam to fix, and avoid to load game manually.Spoiler AlertAbaddon appears in the bible as both a place of destruction and as the name of an angel. The Latin Vulgate and the Douay Rheims Bible have additional notes (not present in the Greek text), ""in Latin Exterminans"", exterminans being the Latin word for ""destroyer"". So if you know this, you will know who is the Destroyer in Darksiders :D "

												Some people refer to Darksiders as ""Zelda meets God of War."" I don't think they mean it in a bad way at all because the game is far different enough from those two to make it's mark as a distinguished title.The comparison to Zelda and God of War are in reference to the fact that this is an action-adventure game with combat similar to God of War and puzzles similar to Zelda. As I said earlier though, this game is different enough from those two that it makes for a fairly unique game experience. Few action games have the kind of puzzles present in this game and almost no puzzle based games feature the combat that Darksiders has. Even though it's different in it's own way than God of War, if you have played GoW you'll feel right at home with the controls and the combat. You have your basic attacks, magic, and a huge number of combos to pull off. Countering enemies is always satisfying and gives you a huge advantage in that moment. Bosses are also great with each providing a slightly different mechanic to use to defeat them.One area where I feel the game could improve is the ratio of combat to puzzles. There were some puzzle sections that seemed to go on just a hair too long as I was itching to kill more stuff. Combat is so fun that you end up missing it when doing the puzzle sections (which are adequate, but not quite up there with Zelda). This slightly breaks up the flow of the game and as I said earlier some puzzle stages definitely overstay their welcome. It doesn't help that the puzzles are usually somewhat mediocre (move x to y, push button, etc.). They aren't bad, but it's not like the combat which in itself is pretty exceptional.On a visual level this is a relatively old game but it still looks pretty good thanks to Todd McFarlane's excellent character designs. Character design is great and you truly get the sense of being in a fantasy/post-apocalyptic setting. Some visual effects are absent as this game was made awhile ago and unfortunately cut scenes are not in 1080p.Puzzles and visuals aside this is one great game. It's fun and challenging without being frustrating and combat is a blast (when you're not solving puzzles). As far as achievements go there are a number of collectibles in the form of upgrades so they are worth collecting even if you need a guide. A forewarning about achievements in this game though: Some will NOT unlock when they should so keep your eye on the corner of your screen when you expect to get an achievement. I found I had to go back several times to pick up an achievement for beating a boss or collecting an item so make a LOT of saves if you can. This doesn't break the experience though and it only happened a few times so I would still give it a shot at getting 100% if you're up for that sort of thing. With great combat and a unique art style (even with dated graphics) Darksiders is a great experience. There really isn't too much else out there like it and it will keep you busy for awhile (15-20 hours).8.5/10			"

The story is quite sophisticated and rough voice of the hero ""War"" you immediately fall in love, as well as the voices of other characters. The game is pretty much like game ""God of War"".

												This game is pretty badass. It plays like a mixture of Zelda and God of War/Devil May Cry/Bayone- Look, you do puzzles and crazy combo attacks, and sometimes you press a button/key to rip some poor soul's limbs off. It is, for the most part, mindless entertainment (other than the puzzles and the brief strategy involved in the combat).The story is based on the Judeo-Christian Apocalypse and one member of its heralds, War of the Four Horsemen, accidentally starting the end of the world too soon. It quickly becomes a story of revenge, justice, and answers as War travels across a destroyed earth (or, more accurately and area that could easily be just what/where New York City and some part of New Jersey used to be. It's not the full planet) taking down other biblical beasts and monsters of both Heaven's and Hell's host. If I am not mistaken, War is actually described as, ""Hunted by Heaven, and Hated by Hell.""While its fun, it is a bit straight forward up until the end, in which you're thrown a few twists and turns.Speaking of being straight forward, the game is fairly linear, but in a more Zelda-y or Halo: CE sense than a Call of Duty and FINAL FANTASY XIII way. You're given many areas (Forgive me for not remembering the exact number, it's actually been months since I played the game) to explore in a pseudo-open world sense, with at least one dungeon per area. In the dungeons, you go back and forth between combat and solving puzzles to progress, and like in Zelda, acquiring a new skill or tool to complete the dungeon and open up old paths for exploration in the other areas.I know I keep referencing Zelda, and while some might consider that to be a bad thing, I certainly don't. I love that franchise, and the only reason I keep alluding to it is because it's a forerunner in its field (kinda), and it really is the best comparison I can make with this game. I'm sure there are a bunch of other puzzle-y, platform-y, RPG-ish games out there that have the same feel as Darksiders, but I just don't know them.Anyway, the sound design is pretty damn spot on. Things squish, crunch, rip and smash in brutally good sounding ways, and War sounds like the embodiment of destruction should. Oh, and Mark Hamil has a voice in this game, and he's always welcome because, well, hell, it's Luke GOSHDANG Skywalker and The Joker (and Skips). The demons sound demonic, the angels sound pious and righteous, and the music... Um. The music didn't stand out to me, at least not like the sequel's does. It was adequate. Enough for a post-apocalyptic action game.The art design is definitely one of my favorite aspects of this game, and the sequel too. It's all comic book-y, and I love it. There's plenty of realism in the environment and some of the characters, but not enough that it looks like it's trying too hard, and not too little to the point that it feels like I'm defintely looking at a cartoon.Now, there is leveling and a small degree of customization involved in the game, but I quickly found a weapon I wanted (which do not present themselves too often) and loaded it with the skill I liked the most (health absorption and DoT, mainly), so I didn't really delve too deeply into the game's RPG elements. Oops (look, this is my first big review, and like I said, it's been a while. Please don't kill me).So I think I covered everything I needed to regarding this game: setting, story, sound, visuals, gameplay. I'm sure I'm missing some stuff, but I don't think I'd be able to say much on it in that case. Anyway, I'd definitely recommend this game. At its worst, the game feels like a 6.5/10 (which it really only hits when trying to solve awkward puzzles), and at its best it's about an 8.5/10 (which it hits quite frequently in my book). Solid game. Solid entry to the genre of Action RPGs. Solid start to a series that I still hope continues on with good development like the first two.'S good game.			"

												This game is an interesting mix of hack and slash and Zelda-like adventure.Pros:Hacking and slashing away at your enemies is fun.Buying the weapon and move upgrades feels comfortable and utilizing each one makes you feel more accomplished like you're actually growing as a character (at least it did for me).You're always unlocking new abilities and items at (seemingly) random points in the story. That element of surprise always intrigued me.The story and voice acting are pretty good. Normally not something I look for in a game like this, but I stayed with it.The finishing moves on bosses and most enemies felt really satisfying.You can get a lot of playtime trying to 100% the game your first time (~20 hours for 100%? Give or take a few hours)Neutral:The difficulty can be a bit sharp at times, especially since health doesn't drop from enemies until your health is critical and earning enough currency to buy health supplements can be risky. Could be good if you like the challenge, but it could also be frustrating.Cons:Game crashes sometimes out of randomness.I felt the dungeons dragged on a little bit sometimes.There isn't really much in terms of replayability.Overall, Darksiders is a very solid game and anybody who likes Zelda or Devil May Cry should at least look into this game when it's on sale.

												With lengthy content, intense gameplay, apocalyptic setting, upgrade system, collectibles and some cool weapons Darksiders had a good potential to be an excellent game. However it just could not live up to my expectations. With cartoonish (yet crisp and clean) visual style, dull storyline and generic hack'n'slash experience it's just a mediocre game. Generally, there's nothing poor about it and yet nothing excellent either. It has just enough to keep you going until the end.The only particular feature in this game I liked was the ability to summon and ride a horse (in the second half of the game). There are not many games you can do that.However there were some faults in this game that allmost ruined the whole gameplay. They definitely were irritating.- Slow ranged weapon controls.- Gigantic bosses in small rooms. It does not substitute for good camera performance. When the developers will learn that? Atleast make the room bigger! So that the boss fits in the field of view.- Overwhelmingly strong enemies at times, some of which are as strong as sub-bosses and it takes eternity to kill them.- Bugs: achievements do not always unlock; some rooms do not unlock or freeze and you are forced to restart the whole game.- Almost no clues. You have to guess everything on your own or watch YouTube to actually understand what to do.- One of the last chapters is all about puzzles. It's a puzzle after a puzzle, after a puzzle, after a puzzle, some fighting and puzzles again. Not that the puzzles are hard, they're actually quite simple, it's just that this chapter is SOOO LOOOONG AND BORING, that I almost quit the whole game. It was a torment for me.- Pointless game saving feature, because you will restart from the last checkpoint anyway (as with autosave), which would be fine unless....- THE CUTSCENES! You enter the boss arena. A cutscene > 1 min, the boss kills you, you start from the checkpoint again. Each time you die, you are forced to watch the cutscene again. You can skip them, but not completely.And, finally, what's with the anime locks hanging out from War's hood? Absolutely ridiculous!What starts as a decent hack'n'slash experience ends as a torment. My overall rating 6/10.Would I recommend to buy this game? Barely. Only with a discount.			"

												*note: I completed this game on XBox, hence 0 played time*Darksiders is awesome fun. It's the story of War, a rudely awakened horseman of the apocalypse, who is trying to still the battlements of Heaven and Hell.The game has a great, flowing story, with a character upgrade model that continues to introduce new features until literally the end of the game. There's lots of ""expanders"" for those who like collecting stuff, and some cute little achievements.The story is really nice though, and with Darksiders 2 coming out this is a must play. The gameplay can get a little monotonous, but if you're a fun of hack and slash games, then this wont even be a problem for you (as it wasn't in my case).Check it out!-Nilesy			"

												Bad port of a good hack and slash game with a very cool artstyle decent boss fights and lots of attributes to customize your weapons with. The puzzle segments can feel a bit long at times but they are always fresh and challenging enough that ur not mindlessly moving and pressing things but not hard to the point you wanna tear your hair out. Unfortunatly the keyboard and mouse controls are bad no matter what configuration you have and very often and many of the achivements for me didnt work, so now it looks like i skipped whole boss fights and didnt collect weapons that i do have. also the mouse likes to fly back to the center of the screen (even when using 360 game controller) whenever you enter your inventory or map which gets very annoying if you use them often. so i reccomend this version of the game to only peopl who poses controllers and dont care to much about collecting achivements. if u dont fall in that category get the ps3 or xbox 360 version			"

I recently finished the first one and going to start the second and even though it's a bit old game, it still has some great visuals and an amazing storyline with some stupidly hard fights once in a while (not talking about boss fights). One last recommendation, don't ever play it on Apocalyptic mod. I did, total waste of time. I want to close my commend with a quote:Uriel: Are you gonna rage this war alone ?War: No, not alone!

												Review update:I got to the last parts of the game and those parts are SUPER SH|TTY, so much that it drops my impressions of the whole game down a big notch. It really was great up to that, but the longwinded finale is so tedious and boring that I won't be finishing it and will watch a Youtube video of the rest of the game instead.Every task no longer feels FUN anymore, they all just feel like WORK, like enduring heavy sack upon heavy sack as an 18th century underpaid dock worker. Ending parts includes a PORTAL device and you all know what that means - super gamey and boring puzzles that are not hard to figure out, only hard to stomach.Ugh, I'm just now watching the YT vid, showing you have to spend an absurd amount of time backtracking all over previous finished/empty levels, just to collect 7 pieces of some ""special"" sword to stab the final boss with - so happy I skipped it. Even the VIDEOS are so boring I have to skip and fast-forward them. It looks like having to do the Water Temple in Zelda 10x in a row. Or doing the awful backtracking in Metroid Prime 2: Echoes in slow motion. Way to top of the game with the biggest yawn in history.I still recommend the game, albeit now with a bad taste in my mouth. Huge disappointment to a game I had pegged as one of the greats of its genre and generation. Why any developer so desperately needs to paint an ugly moustache on their beautiful, nearly finished Mona Lisa masterpiece of a game, I will never know. While playing through the last parts should not even enter your thoughts, I must admit it WAS worth suffering through the videos to see the end cut scene and last dialogue line.If you can look past the big moustache, you still have a great, bada$$ painting underneath.-----------------------------------------Original review:Sweetie, remember to pause a bit from your game and thank uncle Bob immediately when he comes over later, for getting you this game you didn't know much about beforehand. After all, you have been playing it non-stop with your best friend all Christmas morning, haven't you? Taking turns playing the game and sipping at that dark, sweet hot chocolate, helping eachother out with the map, the puzzles and the bosses. Everything in the world is great and awesome and you have your life ahead of you.THAT'S the feeling I get from this game.Of course, I could talk at lenghts about how the late game company's cup runneth over in all other aspects of this gem. The pretty as ♥♥♥♥♥ graphics, great music, just enough tough bosses, fantastic combos and just the right amount of combat variety. But I want you to focus on that feeling instead. Just buy it already and enjoy playing this wonderful and FUN, FUN, FUN visual novel hybrid of elements from Devil May Cry, Dark Souls, Legend of Zelda and other great titles.THQ is dead - Long live THQ! And praise Nordic Games for picking up the pieces and continuing the franchise. And now, if you'll excuse me, I have an awesome playable dark comic to return to and have the best time with.			"

												Darksiders is an action adventure game that while competent, doesn't really bring anything new to the table. It's a mix between a God of War styled combat and Zelda exploration and puzzle solving. Pros-Nice combat that gradually introduces new weapons and items to use-A big world that allows for a bit of exploration-Good amount of upgrades for both your weapons, moveset and other modes-Not that many items but they all have their purpose that makes them uniqueCons-Not enough enemies. In a game where the combat is one of the major elements, it doesn't help when you usually only fight 5 or so enemies at a time. There is also little enemy variety.-The world is huge but doesn't feel natural. With no towns or relevant NPCs or sidequests, it feels like a giant corridor. There is little reason for backtracking other than getting to chests you couldn't reach before, which you either have to do  every single time you get a new item or wait until the end of the game when you already have every item-Enemies placed outside of dungeons are repetitive and sometimes a few zones won't even have any enemies at all-Too easy, both the combat and the puzzles, safe for a few examples near the end.-Nothing new about any element in the game. All items and puzzles have a certain ""been there, done that"" feel to them.Conclusion: I realise that I listed more Cons than pros, but I still enjoyed the game. It just seemed to be dragged down by a lack of originality and a few amateurish flaws like the overworld's design and the simplicity of both the items, their function and the puzzles themselves.I recomend it to anyone who enjoys this type of game, unless you're craving for something new and original, which darksiders doesn't provide at all. It competently follows the mold of all the elements in most action/adventure games, nothing more, nothing less.			"

												This was the first game I have played in years that gave me that same epic feel of Zelda.  I had been really missing the whole dungeons with totally epic boss battles vibe, and Darksiders delivers.  The story is a little odd at first, but I got more into it as the game went on.  My favorite section is fighting when you first get your horse and fight this awesome arena battle and the subsequent sandworm boss -- I was totally sucked into the atmosphere.Another great aspect of the game is the on-the-fly loading.  I'm surprised no one else has mentioned this, but it's huge for me.   I play games to immerse myself in another world, so I HATE loading screens, and in this game you can run across the entire game world without a single one!  Applause to the developers for that one.It falls in to the hack-n-slash style of combat with projectile weaponry mixed in for variety.  There's a lot of combos, and it can get a little tedious if you don't force yourself to try new moves.  That being said, each dungeon typically requires you to use new skills to defeat the boss, it's more about switching things up on the smaller enemies.I do wish more of the characters were a little more likeable, but I get why they are the way they are.  All-in-all, if you loved games like Zelda: Ocarina of Time back in the day, get this for sure.			"

												I came in to Darksiders with no previous notion of what the game or gameplay entailed. I was immediately impressed with the gameplay, and the graphics are decent, although the cutscenes graphics are lacking compared to in-game graphics, which can be forgiven for a 4-5 year old game.The gameplay almost never gets stale, it changes up enough to keep it from getting boring. Even when you have to fight the same mini-boss multiple times they change it up enough to keep it interesting. On normal mode the game seemed easy, so if you are an avid, able gamer, I suggest playing on difficult.This is one of my favorite games of all time. The puzzles are interesting and the story is good. It reminds me of The Legend of Zelda puzzles crossed with World of Warcraft style graphics, and the combat is reminiscent of slashers like Devil May Cry and hero titles like Arkham Asylum and Deadpool, where grappling an enemy makes the other baddies wait for you to finish.Completing the game took roughly 24 hours of gameplay on normal mode while hunting down every upgrade, armor piece and treasure chest I could find.

												Reminds me alot of DMC and GoW and a couple of other PS2 games of the genre. At first it seemed a little too simple but as you progress in the game you will find how much variety there is, both in combat and in puzzles. I like how the main character is such a badass and playing as him you can just plow through hordes of enemies. The thing I like most about the game so far has to be the boss fights. You can get really creative while fighting them, dodging their attacks, countering their blows and hitting their weakspots and finally finishing them with a unique blow that often gets pretty ugly. Can't wait to finish this game so I can try out the sequel. The game is great but the one thing that bothered me was the way they layed out the keybindings. I fiddled around with them a bit but didn't quite get them to be as smooth as I would have liked.			"

												In six words: a darker and edgier Zelda clone.Don't expect crazy parkour, stealth sequences or an award-worthy plot: it's not that kind of game. What you get is a fairly linear action title mixing hack & slash action sequences with environmental (and/or ability-based) puzzles and backtracking for powerups (and at the end, for a bunch of plot tokens) rather typical for its' metroidvania roots and character design closely based on Joe Madureira's art style.Yes, the game is fairly simple... but you know what?

												Darksiders™ is one of the first action-adventure hack and slash games I've ever played. And I have experienced something absolutely unique and peculiar. I never thought I'd like as much as I did.   When I first started the game I had no idea what's going on. The game looked so complex and chaotic at first. Even though I was getting a lot of tips and hints like this - ""Use War's Wrath to enter Chaos Form""; I was still feeling lost. But after about half an hour things became much more easier. And the next day the game was crystal clear to me. It felt like I was reading a very interesting book. With every turn of it's page, I was experiencing a new, fascinating adventure which charmed me all the way to the bones.     The gameplay consists of combat, puzzles and exploration. You start as one of the ""Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse"" - War. You become a blank page, and start slowly getting stronger, faster, smarter. As you continue to progress, all sorts of new weapons, powers and artifacts will be unlocked. Some are unlocked automatically, and others require a fair share of exploring in order to be found. All sorts of things are scattered arround in the decaying post-apocalyptic world. Including a lot of hard-to-find collectibles that reward the player in various pleasing ways. Better weapons allow you to defeat your enemies with greater alacrity. New equipment such as: the ""Crossblade"", or the ""Revolver"" also comes in handy when dealing with certain enemies or even some puzzles. Along with weapon-based attacks, War can also use an array of magic-based attacks, known as Wrath powers, that are both offensive and defensive in nature. War's most powerful ability is that he can transform into his Chaos Form: which transforms him into a large, fiery and extremely resistant entity that can cause heavy damage. But my favorite ability comes at a later point in the game. It is the ability to summon War's own fiery horse - Ruin. Not only that it provides faster movement, but also boosts War's attacks greatly. What could be better than riding a fast fiery horse through the golden desert while shooting giant sand-worms with your revolver from it's back ?   The boss battles are awesome in Darksiders™. They feel epic and grand, full of determination and occasionally, oh who am I trying to fool, and mostly gore. War has a unique way to kill each particular type of enemy, usually tearing them apart painfully. Especially the bosses, by ripping their hearts out with his bare hands.    Speaking of War... he is one of the most vibrant and intense protagonists I've ever seen. Liam O'Brien did an amazing job voicing War, giving him the perfect attitude and emotions. War is a powerful warrior with a strong sense of honor who will stop at nothing to gain revenge for being betrayed. The fury of his massive sword is unmatched in combat. As unyielding as time itself, War is both honorable and savage. Which makes him very memorable and likeable, and easily one of my favorite characters ever.    The game generally feels great. There are a lot of different places to visit. Starting from the hot depths of hell filled with lava, and ending with the pure and peaceful Eden itself. You get to meet angels and demons, spiders and ghouls, skeletons and abominations, and a lot of other creatures that you could count as ""Supernatural"".    Darksiders™ has an epic score and an amazing voice acting. It looks fantastic and the story is long and inspiring. Filled with revenge and honor, but also the idea of constant fight between good and evil. With the player taking the role of War, who is lost between those two. Definitely recommended to everyone who loves a great adventure with a bloody fighting system.10/10 "

												This game is amazing! It's like a mix of Devil May Cry, Legend of Zelda, Portal, and Fable The Lost Chapters and balanced nearly perfectly. Combat is fluid and fun and the insane amount of combos and moves makes itfresh and not repetitive (unless you make it repetitive by just spamming the mouse button :P) Power ups are cool and are utilized well IMO. There's a lot of action but also a lot of puzzles and many oppurtunities for exploration. It's an open world and many paths to other areas require puzzles and such and most of the puzzles don't feel tedious and are challenging but very intuitive. There are few exceptions (freeing Azrael took FOREVER and was kinda tedious). Boss fights were a highlight in this game. Bosses were tough but had patterns that you'll pick up on after a while. But using the patterns to your advantage takes skill and precise timing. There are collectibles that help you, like finding artifacts that you can trade in for currency, 10 pieces of armor you can find, chests that include either currency, wrath, health, health or wrath shards to increase your total capacities, trinkets that show you where chests and artifacts are in the area, keys, etc. Cool gadgets and gear offer more variety and also help in puzzles such as a grapple, the voidwalker which is essentially a Portal gun, the shadow mask to go back and forth between the shadow realm and your realm (no this isn't Yu-Gi-Oh in any way), etc. Plus you get to ride a horse that can even help in combat. Controls are great IMO, and I played on the keyboard. Left Alt for dash felt weird at first, but after finding a good placement of my hand on the keyboard it became easy and flowed well. It took me about five minutes or less to get used to. The using CAPS LOCK + 1, 2, or 3 for abilities was the only thing I thought was a bit tricky. I rarely felt the need to use them, though. Also underwater movement was fluid and fun, which is rare I think in a game. The story was really engaging. The ending also had a great little twist. Voice acting was great, save for a few parts, with Mark Hamill doing a full-on Joker voice for the Watcher and Liam O'Brien, the guy who voices Gaara in the english dubbed Naruto series sounding like an ancient version of Gaara as War, the main character. Yes, it's just as awesome as it sounds. The added ability to pick up items in the environment such as cars or telephone poles and use as weapons only added to all the chaotic fun. The boss death scenes were all brutal and soooooo satisfying. I highly recommend this game, it is amazing and the exploration and hidden places and objects adds to replayability.			"

												You take control of ""War"" One of four horsemen who serve The Charred Council. To bring balance between Heaven and Hell from war until kingdom of human are powerful enough for the war.The game is hack and slash so controller will be better than keyboard and mouse, there are the puzzles in the game that took me 15 min to figure it out and some I opened YouTube to pass the puzzle, the graphic of the game is nice even for games standard these days, the combat is very nice and let you use almost all the gadget and tools to kill boss and sometime normal enemies.only problem i have in this game was the achievements you can’t get it if you didn’t reenter steam before you open the game, the vibration of the controller sometime stuck leaving the vibration nonstop.other than that the gameplay and the story is very nice.Starting Darksiders 2 after this review.

Unlike a Devil May Cry, you can explore an open world. The story is also as great as a Devil May Cry (DMC). As a DMC your currency are souls which are obtained by defeating enemies or opening some chests. There are 3 kinds of souls in fact : health (green), currency (blue) and wrath (yellow). Like a DMC you'll unlock several close and long range fighting weapons, purchase many moves and wrath abilities. Finally there is the famous dungeons and bosses areas.What a great game to feel strong and invincible. I would say if feels like a relaxing game.(#) :One very good glitch at the end of the game, is that you can spawn horsemen as you wish by leaving and entering the area. A very epic fight with your horse.(*) :If you wish to have all achievements you must follow the tips listed below (thanks to a guide on steam) :- Turn off the steam overlay in the game, exit steam (steam -> exit), launch steam and play the game.- You can only play one session of Darksiders in each steam session, if the game crash it counts too. So the famous exit steam (steam -> exit), launch steam and play the game is needed.- Always made saves before the part where you should unlock an achievement if you want to prevent the points above.

												Man.. What do I say about Darksiders.. Well, it is by no means a bad game. The gameplay and combat is clean; the puzzles are intriguing enough; the voice acting is fairly well done (especially work done by Mark Hamill); and most enemy designs are intuitive and fun to fight. Speaking of enemies, instant killing enemies is such a joy! However...Darksiders is woefully uninspired. There is absolutely NOTHING original about this game. Everything about the combat, the puzzles, the level/game design, the level up schematic, and even the way you ride your horse (which you won't do very often) is borrowed from other game designs. If you have every played God of War and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time you will quickly pick up on the tropes and cliches that this game uses. Also, the bosses are simple and gimmicky. Not to mention that the game is fairly easy, even on hard. Lastly, the lore is mildy interesting but the plot and story execution are weak and it just feels like set up for the sequel. Final Word: Don't take my criticism as me not liking the game. I did enjoy it but it is far from being a great game. If you like linear hack and slash action games like God of War and Devil May Cry then you will enjoy this game. However, if you are looking for something fresh, new, and innovative, then Darksiders simply won't fit the bill. P.S I recommend playing with a controller; better layout and feel. Happy Gaming!			"

												This is one of my all time favorites. It lends to the playstyle of a Legend of Zelda game in a bad♥♥♥♥♥apocalyptic/armageddon setting. The story comes from a comic book theme and it is very engaging and well told. I'm on my second playthrough trying to collect every artifact.I've recommended this game to all my gamer friends and casuals alike. The character details and artwork are amazing. You start off being framed and accused of triggering earths apocalypse and while some of it can be predictable to some, it takes you on a dramatic and action packed roller coaster ride throughout. I've only played with keyboard/mouse so I can't offer much input on the Rumblepad/XBox controller issues, but the mechanics of the controls make it very accessible.Still remains one of my recent favorites in my Steam library and for me that speaks a great deal because few of my games have held my attention for as many hours as Darksiders has.

The story has some twists and at one moment I kind of lost it,it's not that complicated though it was just me not paying attention ;p Great voice acting and fantastic characters. A big varied world wich you can explore and collectibles galore. Good graphics with nice art style. Visually stunning boss fights. An epic soundtrackOverall a good game wich will probably keep you interested to it's very end. "

												As something of a dark take on Zelda games, Darksiders is an underrated action platformer that never really attracted as big an audience as it probably deserved. It's not without its flaws - particularly as an unfriendly PC port - but the storytelling and combat are good enough to justify the price of admission.You play as War, one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse. Dressed like something out of Warhammer 40K, and wielding a huge two-handed sword named Chaoseater, War has been summoned to Earth to take part in the final battle between angels, demons and man. Or so he thinks. When it is revealed that the horsemen were not in fact summoned, War is accused of taking the apocalypse into his own hands and sentenced to death. He successfully protests, and vows to right his wrong, but also to uncover why he was on Earth if he had not been summoned. War employs a variety of familiar weapons and tools reminiscent of Zelda, but with a twist. The magical boomerang becomes the crossblade (huge shuriken), instead of a bow and arrow War carries a pistol named Mercy, and the hookshot is known as the Abyssal Chain. He also has some magic, but all these play second fiddle to the combo-based swordplay. Three main weapons are at War's disposal: the aforementiond Chaoseater, a mystical scythe, and a powered fist weapon, of which the sword and one of either the scythe or fist can be equipped at any one time. Tapping the attack button for either begins a chain, and you can incorporate attacks from either of his two weapons at any time. Delaying input for half a second at certain points in the combo can open up new combo moves, usually with a situational purpose such as an area attack, and War can also launch and air combo his enemies if he so desires.The weapons and tools have upgrades, not just simply increasing damage but adding new combo moves and abilities, such as a spinning airborne slash for the Chaoseater or allowing the crossblade to bounce between nearby enemies. When things get really hectic, War can transform into a big fiery demon for a short amount of time, greatly increasing the power of his attacks and making him near-invulnerable. The only real problem with the combat is that there aren't enough keys on an xbox controller (mouse and keys are not ideal) to map everything, meaning you'll mostly be sticking to two or three favoured items.Darksiders is a worthy addition to any collection, and clocking in at less than 20 hours means it's good value for money without becoming a drag. The combat is fast-paced and varied, and the presentation while dated is expertly executed. The only real issue with it is the dodgy PC compatability, which you can choose to fix or ignore, and meaning that you'll probably want a controller if you really want to enjoy it.+ Combat is great fun+ The setting and story are well conceptualised- Dodgy PC port			"

It has all that is needed for a really good game - decent plot with some twists, memorable characters, voice acting ('Fresh merchandise' ;D), plenty of combos, abilities, well designed levels, riddles and really awesome boss fights. There are a lot of collectibles as well that makes gameplay even longer and more entertaining.			"

												This is a fantastic game. I was expecting a cheap God of War Clone, but it's far better than that. For one thing the Horseman War is far more interesting a character than Kratos, whose one-note vengeance act is wearing pretty thin. Great atmosphere, fun combat, very creative puzzles, and some of the best creature design ever. It's a long game with tons of bosses, and they're all awesome looking. New elements are constantly introduced to keep it fresh--grappling hook, horseback combat, and even some Portal dynamics near the end. The biggest criticism is that Darksiders doesn't do anything new, but combining all these great elements from other games so successfully IS something new.			"

												Darksiders is a game in love with games. It has very clearly been inspired by giants like Ocarina of Time and God of War, but somehow manages to pull it off to mix those inspirations together, along with a couple of others, while still being it's own thing.That's a great acomplishment! Too bad it's the only impressive thing about the game.It's not bad, but it's not great either. It's decent. I found the setting and art to be boring, the story unintentionally laughable (in a good way, though) and didn't enjoy the atmosphere. But I still had a good time. And if you enjoy the games Darksiders loves, i'm quite certain you'll enjoy yourself, too. Not every game has to blow your mind.Unless, ofcourse, they do. Then move along.			"

												After 5 years of wanting to play this game and end it in a few weeks finally came to happen and I'm glad I finished it. Great story with lots of elements come into play one step at a time, lots of progressive fights also. The puzzle's are ok but after 10 hours of game-play I felt that there were just to many puzzle's specially at some levels.The artwork and details throughout the game are superb even though it's a game with some years on it. I will probably play darksiders 2 also and see how it goes.Just had some problems with cutscenes not being played, after some research found it was related to a pack of codecs I had, after uninstalled the codecs the cutscenes were played without flaws.Nowadays there are too much games focused on the multiplayer aspect and sometimes a solid single player campaign like this it's all we need to reignite the passion that gaming brings. Specially if you started playing videogames before the ""internet boom"" of late 90's.			"

												A very good single player adventure game with a mature and badass setting and lore. The item mechanics is similar to that of Zelda games while the combat is more that of god of war. This is not a bad thing since they have taken some of the best elements we have seen from other games and perfected it. As long as you are not overly critical and expecting something totally new or original you should not get disappointed.The PC mouse and keyboard controls are even better than the consoles gamepad version since you can now control the camera much more effectively, rendering the occasional tasks of aiming easier as well as less need of focusing the view on specific targets. As long as you map the keyboard layout to your preferences, controls should be precise and combat should be fun and challenging. If you prefer tight gamepad controls, then you can always use a xbox 360 controller.The graphics and effects are nice and colorful with the limitations of that of the consoles Xbox 360 and PS3. The only setting you can change is the resolution so there are no improvements for the PC in those regards.			"

												Darksiders is a hack 'n slash game that mixes a little of Devil May Cry and God of War styles in my opinion. However, Darksiders has its own identity that sets the game in a different way compared to other famous hack 'n slashes. The graphics, the story, and the gameplay are great, but there are some things in the game that makes it a little boring as the loop that the gamer has to play into. What I mean is basically that the action is always the same, there are no many variations between the enemies being a little cliche. Despite all of the cons, the game still good to play, and who is a huge fan of hack 'n slash, I totally recommend the game!			"

												F***ING GREAT GAME!it's like zelda, meets god of war, meets portal 1 and 2, meets some open world game.visit this castle here, solve puzzles and find secrets areas which contain special items of sorts.... then go to that castle there and do the same.....fight the bosses. similar to zelda.combat is like what you'd find in god of war...as is the scenery and background areas...and boss fights.open a portal here, and one over there. go through one to come out the other. use this to get to certain areas unreachable. also use this to solve puzzles. similar to portal 1 and 2.upgrade weapons and abilities, buy new comboes, and other upgrades, etcgame is pretty open, i wanna say it's open world.PROS:amazing graphics!great storyupgrading systembattle system is greatvisuals/scenery is cool lookingopen worldishsecret areas with special itemsboss fightsetcCONS:not a big fan of the puzzles at the end of the game...towards the end of the game there isn't much action, but there are way to many puzzles and they are extremely difficult. i have beaten the game finally, if it werent for youtube walkthroughs i dont think id have been able to figure out acouple of these puzzles. thank god for youtube!! ;)overall this is a great game, pretty balanced game play between the action combat and puzzles, very good story line, and fun to play.

												I played Darksiders on 360 when it first came out and at first I was disappointed. The combat seemed shallow and I genuinely thought it was going to be a brainless hack n slash from start to finish... oh how wrong I was.  The best way I can think of to describe Darksiders is as a cross between God of War and The Legend of Zelda. Admittedly, the combat isn't as good as GoW's and the puzzles are better in Zelda, but after playing through Darksiders and thoroughly enjoying it I prefer to look at things the other way around: the puzzles are better than GoW's and the combat is better than in Zelda. It really is a AAA game.Get past the slow start and you'll find one of the most underatted games of recent years. And you play as War. WAR ffs! How cool is that?!			"

												As a serial non-completionist I'm going to throw in my review now, should I eventually abandon finishing this game. If I do it won't be due to Darksiders being boring or lacking in my eyes - far from it.I really enjoy the story so far, the graphics and the environments are beautiful and ultimatly the game is a lot of fun but I don't own a controller. I don't doubt plenty of people could still complete this game without one but I doubt I'm one of those people. If I never pick up this game again I will have to watch some gameplays as I'm very intrigued by the story.I got this and Darkseiders II on sale for about £5 total so I've gotten more than my money's worth before even starting the second game, which I'm determined to do eventually. Even if, like me, the controls are a bit of a struggle for you I'd say this game's still much worth a try.			"

												This is a great action game with good story and variety in gameplay. However, there is one bug concerning achievements: if you quit the game on steam and later start it again (without restarting steam), you won't get any achievements for that session. Another bug is that on the startup many older screen setups will get stuck on a black screen. But that can be resolved by altering names of 3 video files.			"

												One of the best hack and slash games I've played on PC , up there with it's sequel , Darksiders 2. The game features extremely cinematic fighting and , unlike a number of other games like it , does not rely on QTs quite as much with only the occasional B button.Speaking of the B button , even though this is a PC game , an Xbox pad is highly recommended. Button mashing when it comes to a keyboard is a bit dodgy , even if you are good. This really goes for all hack and slash games since it puts way too much strain on your hardware to make sense using it to smash your foes' faces in.The storyline will pick you up and leave you guessing at the next twist. Just be sure that it will guide you very well onto the end. The game does have open world elements but the path is a little more restricted than I would like. There are a large number of areas but not every part of it is traversable. In Darksiders 2 , there are huge open fields and deserts which give a great feelign of the scale of the world. Darksiders feels kind of squashed into a small area. There is plenty of variety in your foes , though , so there probably won't be many times where you have to stop to look at the view.Problem solving is in the game but is very minimal. Don't buy this if you are looking for puzzles from the old Tomb Raider games.Length wise , the game is sufficiently long to keep you entertained. I would have liked a little more but perhaps it would run out of steam if it was going too long.			"

												A so called modern update to Link, The Legend of Zelda.  Darksiders is based on The Four Horseman of the Apocalypse though focuses on one, the protagonist War.  What his mission comprises I'll leave to your play-through but he is accompanied by a companion voiced by Mark Hamil of Luke Skywalker fame.  The voice acting is AAA Hollywood material and the characters really come to life because of it.  The combat is substantially solid and the weapons are few but are socket-able via modifiers and they level as well.  The move sets as usually found in this genre are purchasable by souls that you obtain through various methods.  Creative puzzles dominate some sections but may occasionally break the flow of the game.  There are the customary difficultly levels so whether you are an abecedarian or gods gift there's something here for everyone to luxuriate in.  The studio responsible for the production, Vigil Games were newcomers on the development scene when the game was produced but I was surprised to see in the credit roll that Silicon Knights had a hand in development as well.   A stellar production.Nominated.			"

												The worst you can say about Darksiders is that there's hardly an original bone in its body. The game is broadly a mix of God of War and Zelda, even down to the same structure of dungeons, chests, keys and a horse, but it doesn't reach the high standards of the games it copies, and the art style and tone of the game aren't particularly inspiring either.However, it is solidly-made and usually fun. There are some frustrating bits (one in particularly where I nearly threw in the towel) but if you can forgive the unoriginality and you get on with repetitive enemy encounters, you'll probably find something to enjoy. I found it okay, but I wouldn't particularly recommend it.			"

												I've heard a lot of people call this a Zelda ripoff, which I think is misleading. It's true that a lot of mechanics are ripped straight from Zelda, but it plays very differently.The biggest differences are that it is much more linear and has a higher emphasis on combat. It is definitely closer to a hack'n'slash than an RPG. Fights are almost constant except in some of the more puzzly dungeons and you frequently need to battle wave after wave of enemies. It helps that the combat system has a lot more depth than Zelda games, with six(ish) different weapons, unlockable combos, weapon modifiers, and weapon levels (you gain XP as you fight).It has some minor issues on modern systems (it takes some work to get the in-game cutscenes working and to run at 2560x1440) and can get a little repetitious towards the end but it's still an enjoyable, solid experience.

												""The Heaven hunts you. The Hell hates you.""Darksiders is a brutal Hack'n'Slay Adventure.___________________________________________________++Story++In 2010, the Earth is going to be hit by some meteorites. These are not just rocks, but the actual armies of Heaven and Hell, ready to fight each other in an epic battle. Mid in the fight, another man falls from the sky: The Apocalyptic Horseman War. He does not fight for any side in the battle, he is just there to keep the balance, but there is one problem. The Horsemen are only allowed to interfere when the 7 seals are broken. And nobody broke them. War gets teleported to the fiery council, who go into court with him because he broke this rule. He tells them that he has gone to earth because he thought the seals were broken. The fiery council gives him another chance to get rid of his guilt, by killing The Destroyer, the one who started the battle between heaven and hell. So War gets sent back to earth, 100 years after the apocalypse.++Gameplay++The gameplay is a typical Hack'n'Slay. War is badassily strong and gets to fight against a lot of enemies at once. His sword swings hit many enemies at once, and there are other weapons to be aquired with other abilities. The battles feel good and fluid, the finisher moves are brutal and the blocking/evading works great.But there is more than just fighting. The game provides levels and riddles that make it feel like the result of hot sex between God of War and The Legend of Zelda. The riddles can get really hard at times, but not frustratingly hard, so the game does not get boring.There are a lot of collectibles in the open world, and they also help War, like the Abyssal Armor. There are 10 pieces to find, that are pretty well hidden. If you find all pieces, you get one badass armor.Sadly, the programming is weak at times and lets the game crash from time to time. There are also some bugs, like falling through the ground (happened to me 4 times). Good thing that there are enough checkpoints to make up for such annoying bugs.++Grafics++The grafics like a bit comic-like. The characters look extremely packed with muscles, blood squirts en masse, the bosses are huge and monstrous. The environment is very variable, from the destroyed remains of New York over a forest to a huge desert. The light effects look great and the textures are detailed.++Music++Huge, aggressive sounds of orchestral rage are violating your ears in this game. The music fits extremely good with a game where you play as The Apocalyptic Horseman War himself.++Features++Given that Darksiders has a little bit of a comic style, there is also an actual official comic that helps the players understand the lore and get more information about the 4 Apocalyptic Horsemen. Search it on google, it is worth it. ___________________________________________________What to say about this game?God of War + The Legend of Zelda = Darksiders <3			"

												As you may have noticed I didn’t write anything on the weekend. I didn’t want to seem too desperate. To make up for it I’ll stay over for a while. Don’t worry, I’ve already cleaned, organized my clothes into your wardrobe and called your mother. Otherwise, here’s a piece on Darksiders. The four horseman of the apocalypse have always been the only remarkable entities in the Bible so Vigil decided that they should be theirs. You play as War because Death is too easy, famine too slow and pestilence… Well what the hell if pestilence going to do? Send you to the nearest emergency room for not washing his hands? But War is the obvious choice for inter-realm bouncing which is exactly what you do. Heaven and Hell are getting too cosy on Earth and you were impugned for it, blah blah blah plot. I mean sure Hell is bad and all, but humans have already been wiped out so I don’t think ‘Stop the Boats’ really applies anymore, especially without Tony Abbott.Other than looking like a complete badass you can swing your sword and shoot your gun. And if you’re clever you can swing your sword and shoot your gun at bad guys. When you’re not doing that you are solving a puzzle that usually involves a ripped off mechanic. By the end of the game you even have a portal gun. That one wasn’t too obvious, no. I will be honest here though, I spent most my time looking over the character in front of a sunset. Or maybe that was a lava-set. I have no idea with apocalypses. In the end it turned out that they didn’t use famine or pestilence, so don’t even get me started on Strife or Fury.			"

												This is one of those games that is appealing on so many levels. For start, i immediately noticed that the game is designed beautifully, from world to creatures, and ofcourse, the main character which really looks like the embodyment of war, wielding the biggest, and the most badass sword since Buster Sword. Story is very well written and actors did an amazing job voicing those cut scenes followed by memorable soundtrack. As for the gameplay, being the most important aspect of video games in my oppinion, i would say that the developers nailed it.I have heard people comparing Darksiders with Zelda games and i would say they are right, cause Darksiders is one of those multy gameplay aspect games. You will be doing everything from world exploring, treasure hunting, money farming, puzzle solving, character upgrading and battling all kinds of enemies in this game.Exploration is fun and very enjoyable because of the above mentioned beutifully designed world and many secrets that it hides.  Often you will come across new tools that will allow you to revisit all those places you have been at before but now you would be able to reach all those previously inaccessible spots and claim their treasures.Combat is great, and i loved the fact that every enemy is challenging in its own way and that you can easily get outnumbered and usually killed if you dont use all the tools and moves that are at your disposal. Its fairly simple but at the same time, requires concentration and awareness. You will want to learn your enemies moves and try to counter them when they make an opening or by executing a perfect parry which will usually devastate them. Sadly, this game has a reverse difficulty curve, meaning that it will be hardest at the start and in time, combat will become much less challenging as u grow in power. However, boss fights are amazing! They are a perfect blend of combat skills and puzzle, and you can always count on these to provide a fair challenge.Also, you should know that this game is not very well ported for PC. Expect FPS drops in some areas(the Ashlands for me) and even game crashing, which, to be honest, happened to me only once, when i first ran the game and met Vulgrim. You probably wont be able to use controller unless u have original XBOX controller(my PS2 controller would make the game unplayable by fixing the camera at awkward angle simply by being plugged in), and no, x360ce probably wont work for you, so you are stuck with a keayboard and mouse. Another very annoying thing are steam achievements which you will not be able to get unless you are running the game for the first time. Every time you quit and re-run Darksiders, you wont be able to achieve anything. Luckily, this is fixed in seconds by simply quitting steam and re-starting it again but you will have to do it every time you wanna play this game.I usually try to go in details with my reviews but, to be honest, that would be it. Game has a simple concept, A to B route, filled with battle encounters, secrets and occasional puzzles(which are also simple but fun), and its executed perfectly. If you take these bad PC porting flaws out of the picture, Darksiders is an amazing game and likely one that you will remember and recommend			"

The enemies sometimes get stuck into the walls. The game crashes a lot. Especially if you like to alt+tab from the game from time to time. It will be hard to get the achievements because they get bugged if you quit the game or get an occasional crash.The puzzles will take the most of your playing time. There is a lot of backtracking too (I really dislike when you have to revisit the locations only because you get a new ability and you can go somewhere where before, you just couldn't).Some people think that it's hard to play with keyboard and mouse, but I completed this game with this setup and I didn't have any trouble (maybe because I'm not a console guy).I think the beginning of the game is a bit too slow paced, the middle game is very enjoyable and the late game is just full of long puzzles with little action.

												Discount. Get this on discount. If it's not at a low price, it's not a good buy. Note that I say ""buy"" and not ""game"".I quite enjoy the game itself, the amount of combos are very satisfying to pull off, and the scenery is splendid with tones of details.Until I got stuck behind a door I accidentally glitched through. No solution. 20 hours gameplay in two days wasted. This game was probably tested by the same people who tested Skyrim, but at least Bethesta had the good sense to put in quick saves and unlimited save slots.Another thing kind of throwing me off is having Captain Jushiro Ukitake on his period voicing War, but that's not their fault, so I don't really hold it against them.So in short, the game is good, and I would recomend it in a heart beat IF it wasn't plagued by bugs, some just instant killing you.

												It's like Zelda but like an edgy WoW Fanfiction written by a 12 year old in 2006 to promote his RP-Characters who funny enough all look pretty ridiculous and have very funny names like ""The Destroyer"". The whole presentation in this game is super hilarious on how serious it presents itself while looking overall rather goofy or to over the top cliche.That aside, Darksiders is a very solid Hack N Slay adventure game that keeps you satisfied and entertained until the very end. That the game takes alot of inspiration from the Zelda series is very obvious to see, which isn't exactly bad as Darksiders implements these elements very good and it can stand on it's own in other regards aswell.Recommended, even if the second one is out.

												Wasn't expecting much when I first started playing it but man, I'm now glad I did! Its basically Zelda with a lot more mature setting and harder difficulty. You'll want to play on Apocalyptic difficulty or you'll be doing yourself a disservice!The game strikes a good balance between combat, platforming and puzzles. I'll admit it, I was stumped a few times but with enough time and a careful eye you should be able to solve/spot the solutions to the games puzzles. The combat is combo based and requires some precision timing and dodging to do well. You also have various powers and 3 main weapon types that you can weave into the flow. As for the setting its post-apocalyptic but ORIGINAL style, that is, ANGELS AND DEMONS and not nuclear war - I like angel/demon style better. :D Some truely epic sights to behold like a giant goth cathedral on an island surounded by lava, a giant desert with huge sand worms on the hunt and a truely massive demon tower looming in the background (your ultimate goal is to get into that tower). Its all connected via a HUB zone and you can freely travel back to previous areas to get goodies you may have missed like heart pieces (life shards) and bottles (vessels), haha its pretty Zelda-like but thats not a bad thing.So, great game. Basically a mature, goth Zelda. Story isn't anything to write home about but it doesn't get in the way and the characters are all pretty awesome. 8.5/10 "

												This game is decent and looses points by not being very grounded by design.It takes influence from a lot of games, does only a few of it good. Good example of too many ideas, no proper excecution. It's presentation is alot like God of war, you know, where there has to be a immersion-breaking cutscene for every enemy, every 10 seconds.The combat is boring, despite being the center of the game It's the weakest aspect of it. Poor camera and the annoying targetting (Pressing RT on the controller) gives you finger cramps. The manual targetting for the crossblade and guns is really bad on controller. Darksiders is pretty much DMC, God of War at it's core minus the fixed camera. It's one of those games that tried to be difficult by being extremely cheap and unfair. Enemies have poor A.I but are given extremely high DPS, so you're given the illusion of ""difficulty"". It's not like Darksouls where everything including the enviroment design constitutes to the difficulty. The boss fights are interesting, some predictable. Worth commeding that the small human size bosses are the most difficult and the big ones are easier, I like this.Darksiders is extremely bloated, some items just thrown in for the chapter and never looked at again (like the horn). Theres alot of backtracking because the first half of the game lenghty fetch quests.What can be praised is the lenght of the game which is quite remarkable and also the repitative but fun puzzles. Both save this game from being a mess.I recommend Darksiders but with patience.			"

												Time Bought:  7 months after release dateMoney Spent: $10 on steam saleWorth The Price?: YES, and then somePosition In Game At Time Of Review:  middle of game, astounded by game qualityThis has been the closest to a 'God of War' type action game I've played to date.  But after you get past that you'll realize that it is it's own game.  The best part is you're actually playing a guy named WAR!!!  It has the puzzles, fatality kills, flying winged beasts, and ALOT of similarities to Kratos's take no prisoners type games but the story is what outdoes the GoW games in this one.  To me it was more cool and 'realistic' than some Spartan who goes rampage and kills all the gods and titans lol...even tho War does kill both demons and angels haha.  Try this out, I'm pretty sure you'll like it.  Even if you don't like it that much, you'd still me a moron if you don't give Darksiders 2 a try :PHere are some gameplay videos for a more visual analysis:http://www.twitch.tv/hastyle1/c/3071574http://www.twitch.tv/hastyle1/c/3071601http://www.twitch.tv/hastyle1/c/3071840Rating: 7/10			"

												8.5 / 10 console port game.-1 point for bad mouse control (read con below)-0.5 point for buggy steam achievement (read con below)Bought this game really cheap, so I was not expecting much from it, but it turned out to be a really pleasant surprise.Game reminds me of Onimusha i used to play years ago, the hack and slash action and especially the counter move.Pro:- very good animations. slahsing demons is fun ok- some VERY good puzzles. this is where it surprised me. I was thinking this is a straight forward hack 'n' slash game but nope. Some puzzles took me quite a while to figure out and so you feel really satisfied when you solve them. You might feel annoyed sometimes when you get stuck on a puzzle somewhere and you just wanna get on with the game, but when you do solve it (without looking at guides that is) you will feel very good about it lol- nice musicCon:- biggest con is this is a console port and it's obvious from the EXTREMELY badly done mouse control. Aiming is jerky and not smooth and it makes gameplay really frustrating sometimes- also sometimes keys do not register properly. I died many times when I pressed jump but didn't work for some reason so i just fall off the map and die- very frequent tearing if you don't have vsync turned on- VERY BUGGY STEAM ACHIEVEMENT INTEGRATION.   this is widely known by now. A lot of times your acheveiment will not unlock on steam. In order to get all achievement, you have to shutdown steam, and only launch the game from its exe file. Also never use Steam overlay, especially the browser. and NEVER TAB OUT or the game WILL CRASH.- you get to have 3 weapons, and after you level them all to max, you realize it's all for nothing because at the final boss fight you get ANOTHER SWORD and it's the only weapon that will do damage to the final boss.  This was disappointing.overall:I would recommend this game for its great Hack n' Slash action and VERY SATISFYING puzzles. Can't stress the puzzle part enough, it is REALLY fun. However due to its badly done mouse control and the buggy Steam achievements, it is recommended you only buy this at a discounted prize.			"

												In short, Darksiders is Legend of Zelda meets bloody apocalypse fighting. It's a fun game as the story was interesting with a decent enough hack and slash fighting system with combos and such. The enemies vary vastly and the bosses are always different. Big lack of PC settings though, you can only change the resolution and v-sync, no aliasing, filtering, etc, just poor port settings. The gameplay, like I said, is similar in vein to The Legend of Zelda, but with a lot more blood. You are War, one of the Four Horsemen sent to confront Abaddon during the final Judgement on Earth. And you fight demons and sheeit, just like Link. The fighting style is even similar, block and attack when possible. Take advantage of enemy weak spots. Roll around and jump attack. Very similar indeed. Even the horse riding and climbing is similar.Still a good game though, despite the flaws with the porting and some minor frame rate issues.8.0/10			"

Introduction : Darksiders is an action role-playing hack and slash video game in which the player takes control of War, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. In third-person perspective, the player engages in combat, puzzles, and exploration.[7] The world is divided into separate locations with many areas initially inaccessible until War regains many of his lost weapons and abilities.(+)Graphics : Great graphics presentation, enhanced colours, and superior attention to detail will amaze you .(+)Music :  There are a total of 35 tracks in this game . Each one of them fitting the position you are in perfectly , making you feel epic while .. well .. being epic .(+)Cutscenes :  The cutscenes are absolutely astonishing . They will pull you towards the game even more than you think . They are full of action , with a great animating .(+)Story :  I've always been interesting in these sorts of games . Mythology , Titans , The Four Horseman of Apocalypse sorta things . For me , this game has a great story . (-)Content :  Not good enough , sadly . The problem with the content of this game is that it's too paced . After playing for hours you will release that you have only done a few things . Slash enemies , talk to the guy at the end , he sends you all over the map to collect 4 different items , walk through all the areas , slash more enemies , get all the items and return them back to the guy , then find another guy , who sends you around the map to find 9 items this time ...It could be a lot more fun if a single objective didn't take hours to complete .(+)Controls :  Controls are decent , could use a bit more improving but they won't bother ya .(+)Gameplay :  The gameplay is pretty cool . Slashing through enemies , especially after you get your horse it never gets boring to kill even more . My only complain is that boss fights tend to take really long , but it's classic for games such as this one .It's definetely worth every dollar if you like hack and slash games , and also into mythology and alike .8/10 -   Triskelion Turbella Reviews   "

												I have over 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews #40 - DarksidersMy first reaction to Darksiders as I played it was that it was very reminiscent of God of War.  I don't consider that a bad thing, but it's hard not to make the comparison as you are hacking and slashing through demons.  But I think it would be a disservice to simply call this a God of War clone, as there are some differences that make Darksiders stand on its own, particularly with it's emphasis on puzzles.The art style has a comic book influence to it, and I thought it worked well.  The only negative is a relative lack of graphic options.  You can change resolutions and set v-sync, but otherwise there are no real customization options.  This isn't a dealbreaker to me at all, and I would still recommend this game.  I'm definitely looking forward to spending more time in it.			"

												Darksiders is a typical example of what games were like before developers went crazy and started making every game open-world, have some form of multiplayer and flood the consumer with twelve DLC packs.It's a return to the pre-2010 days, when linear action-adventure hack-and-slash games with a little bit of puzzle elements were the norm. This game is linear, but not in a bad way. It doesn't hold your hand at all times, and sometimes it leaves you having to figure things out on your own.The combat system is not super deep, but it sure is entertaining to mow your way through dozens of enemies.

												Darksiders was a welcome surprise when I tried it out a few years back. I’m a big fan of the game’s art design and concept, and the gameplay is deceptively simple despite looking really cool. You can watch the game’s opening cinematic on Youtube for a pretty good idea of what to expect in terms of story and style. It’s awesome.First off, it’s an older title so most of you folks should be able to run it with no problem. The game is a 3d “hack & slash” played in third person perspective, but not “over the shoulder.” The game plays well with a controller, but I went through it with keyboard+mouse with no problems.  There’s no “loot” system so you’re fixed in the weapons you can use, but by unlocking different “moves” you can build combos. I’ve heard that the game is really similar to the God of War series in terms of combat, but I’ve never played those so I can’t say for sure. Not only is there a large variety in the enemies you can fight, but there are a bunch of boss battles too. Be warned though that there are puzzle elements to some of the levels which can get very annoying. I had to look online for puzzle solutions a few times.In the story, you play as War, one of the mythical 4 Horsemen who are tasked with preserving “The Balance” between Heaven and Hell.  When the “End War” starts and Hell invades the Earth, it’s time for you to step in kick some♥♥♥♥♥ both demon and angel. After you’re done with the game you might scratch your head a bit trying to figure out what happened (why did this character do that?) but when you’re actually playing it doesn’t pull you out of the game. Also, the ending cinematic really revs you up for the sequel.Overall, the game a definite must play. It’s been in Humble bundles a few times so you might have it without even realizing it. It’s definitely worth your time to play through. A piece of advice though. If you’re playing the game for the first time with the help of an online walkthrough, DON’T collect the Abyssal armor for your first play through. It makes the game too easy. "

												I loved parts of this game. The parts that were good were extremely good. The parts that were bad stuck out like a sore thumb. The story was amazing, characters were interesting, and the environment was ridiculously beautiful (as beautiful as a post apocolyptic world can be). This game had everything going for it. Weapon upgrades evenly spaced out giving you enough time to play around with them all without getting bored. I loved the sidequest that had me gather tokens from every zone, giving me rewards for each one i collected. This was the first game I used every single power up because they were ALL useful and beneficial. This is by far one of my personal favorite games I own.     Onto the bad. One thing that frustrated me most is that the Achievements for this game can and will glitch out. I cant even remember how many times i would find all the collectables and realize the game FORGOT to award the achievement and thus result in me having to RESTART THE GAME in order to get it all over again. This is only an issue if you care about achievements, this does not hinder gameplay in any way. The second thing I can complain about is the lack of replayability value to this game. Once you defeat the bosses and aquire the collectables, there is no reason to go back, and the enemies get replaced with weaker ones, making the zone a joke to clear. If this game let me restart with my currencies after i beat it, that would make it much more fun and give me that reason to play it again. But as it stands, once you obtain the collectables and beat the bosses, there isnt much of a reason to continue playing.      In conclusion, this game offered me a great experience while progressing through the story. Problems arose as you start entering your last quarter of the game where there becomes less and less to do. It's great that you aquired all 10 pieces of your abyssal armor set, to bad there isnt much to do in the game by the time you get it other than defeat the final boss with it or use it while obtaining the last few collectables. 8/10 if i were to rate this game. It's great but could've been better with just a few additions.EDIT: apparently you can create a new game after you beat the last boss and start with the abyssal armor if you collected all the pieces in your first playthrough. This is vary nice and does add some replayability.			"

I got all of the achievements in 124 hours on record but they could've been done a lot faster, like 40-60 hrs but I had a can of a PC back in the day so...I will do some pros and cons for the gamePROS-Good graphics-Great story-You play with one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse so that's pretty cool-Great mechanics-Great cutscenes-Great character models and art-Almost zero bugs or issues with the game-A lot of gear, weapons and finishing moves and you get a horse to ride on-Great boss fights-You get the Soundtrack with the game-You also get a small comic with the game-Community is really smallCONS-The bugs that are present are game-breaking/achievement-breaking. Game-breaking: when you go through the Serpent Holes, there's a chance of you being stuck in a cutscene when you get out of the Serpent Hole. Achievemet-breaking: achievements only count when you start the game for the first time, if you boot it up and don't restart Steam, the achievements won't count - so just restart Steam when you close the game.I recommend this game. I rate it 8/10 would be War again!			"

												I have over 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews #40 - DarksidersMy first reaction to Darksiders as I played it was that it was very reminiscent of God of War.  I don't consider that a bad thing, but it's hard not to make the comparison as you are hacking and slashing through demons.  But I think it would be a disservice to simply call this a God of War clone, as there are some differences that make Darksiders stand on its own, particularly with it's emphasis on puzzles.The art style has a comic book influence to it, and I thought it worked well.  The only negative is a relative lack of graphic options.  You can change resolutions and set v-sync, but otherwise there are no real customization options.  This isn't a dealbreaker to me at all, and I would still recommend this game.  I'm definitely looking forward to spending more time in it.			"

												Heavily inspired by Zelda and God of War which is ultimately a positive thing because both of those franchises are awesome but there is no aspect of the game that does anything better than those two. The combat is pretty basic and very repetitive, it’s not very enjoyable especially compared to other hack and slash games. The story is just a very average fantasy plot, nothing about it feels very unique, interesting or different. The Zelda like dungeons, progression and exploration is the highlight of the game, however there is no music to accompany you while you are doing these things it just kind of makes things feel a little empty, dour and less enjoyable. I also just want to point out how awful and drawn out the portal sequence towards the end of the game was, it completely killed the pacing on the game. My experience with this game was ultimately very boring, the pros of the game are not good enough for me to recommend the game but I can’t say it’s a bad game either. It's overall just a very average action adventure game that can easily be skipped.5/10 (Average)			"

												Darksiders ReviewAs a player who has reached 100% I can say with ease that this IS a fun game!for people who like hack & slash like devil may cry & god of war, those people  will easly enjoy this game.this game is more set on story then on repetitive, so keep that in mind. you'll have your occasional crash from time to time but it's not like it's the end of the world thanks to the autosave.there is a known bug with unlocking achievements but this has not been adressed so just google it.other than that, i do recommend this game for people who like singleplayer or hack & slash or people who enjoy a story game :)			"

												I almost passed on this game because I could not get it to run. Eventually following the troubleshooting guides, I did and I am very glad I took the time to do this.Darksiders was a very solid action game. The gameplay is similar to God of War and the Batman Arkham series. While the textures and character may lack detail of other games, the action is fast, the framerates are extremely high, the voice acting is superb, and the story is decent.The combat system is interesting, at first it seems if you mash the attack button (a controller is pretty much a requirement for Darksiders), you will kill everything is sight but this quickly becomes not the case. You need to be more careful, dodge, avoid, and counter. A full frontal assault rarely works. I do prefer the Batman Free Flow combat system though and it allows for endless combos a much more fluid experience.To finish the game game you're looking around 13-15 hours, more if you plan on exploring every nook and cranny. I would go 8/10 for Darksiders.			"

Love the combat system even if I find it very tedious. People liken this to the god of war and Devil May Cry series, I can see it that but I dont know if I see it better than those two series. Combat seems to be forced and a quick way to end it is to smack down an enemy enough and quick kill it (locking yourself into animation and see war obliterate the enemy). For me this combat mechanic doesnt do much for me. Looking forward to booting up Darksiders 2 once I get all the collectibles in this game!			"

												One of the best in it's genre.Great atmosphere, pretty cool story, challenging gameplay (I played only Apocalyptic), one of the best combat systems designed (Warrior Within had it better, though). Very intensive finale - worth making it there after getting all the ""life shrines"" (I'm talking about the armor here). While the game takes a lot from the others in the genre - it's for the better of the game, as all of those things fit into Darksiders universe.I can recommend it blindly to anyone who enjoyed Devil May Cry/Legacy of Kain (Soul Reaver included)/Prince of Persia The Sands of Time Trilogy.

Well, this game was like an enlightenment for me. It was one of my first Hack n Slay games that I ever played and it was sooo good and it is now. I rebought it on Steam (I bought it earlier for console) to enjoy it on my PC and besides the bad key controls (which can be overcome easily with a controller :)) it is one of the best Hack n Slay games out there. The storyline is interesting as well, nothing special but very well-implemented. I have nothing more to say about this game except that everybody should try it out because otherwise you would miss a masterpiece of Hack n Slay.			"

												Great game to be honest, Except the gameplay wasn't as fluid as one would like, the dodge and block mechanics are just terrible. You are never told if block works against certain stronger bosses but it seems to do nothing at all. Also the dodge does♥♥♥♥♥♥all as you can rarely evade attacks, As soon as an attack animation begins on you even 3 dodges to the next direction won't save you. Its a bit annoying. Then the annoying part is constantly running back in the game's levels and revisiting the same old parts over and over through boring running. I'd give it a 6.5/10 It definitely has its fun moments but the game in general had some annoyances.			"

												Heaven and Hell have broken the rules in their eternal battle for supremacy. Instead of taking a side, remind them of their place.You play as War, one of the 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse. At first I took this title for just another God of War clone. Don't get me wrong, that's not a bad thing. Zelda clone, Metroid clone, these are all great titles to take inspiration from.But that's just the impression at face value, and while it does share many similarities to games like God of War and Devil May Cry, it's almost a blend of the two, with enough interesting and unique aspects to set it apart from either of those franchises and carve its own niche in the genre.I thought perhaps this was going to be like Dante's Inferno, but it's interesting in the sense that you don't side with ""good"" or ""evil"" at all, rather you're more of a 3rd, neutral option in the conflict, trying to stop both sides equally.If you enjoy any of the titles mentioned above, you will feel right at home here.

Awesome graphics, original storyline and a very very different twist to rpgs. I'm really suprised how much fun this game is. Once again dont even try to play without a xbox controller for the pc. By now everyone should have one anyway. I love the original creatures and unique strategic boss fights. So many options, combos and sweet finishing moves. Very welldone voice acting as well. Alot of people complaining about it being a port but I'm just not seeing where the complaints are coming from. This game is worth 4x what I paid for it and I'll be first in line to buy the sequel.

												This is one of those games that you have to give a chance, cause you won't likely fall inlove with it immidiately. To my surprise though I liked this, more than the sequal.Has many clever puzzles and enjoyable boss fights that each have their own gimmic to win. It's sort of like a gorey zelda clone.The biggest issue I had with this game, was that I constantly felt under powered. The lowest level enemies take several hits to dispatch until the end. Didn't really find myself using anything more than 2-3 moves and the default sword  the entire game. Would really of liked to see more useful unique weapons as you progressed to replace it. There are other weapons, but their usefulness is debatable.WARNING:1) There seems to be a bug for some, where you have to restart steam everytime you play or you won't unlock achievements. So make sure you're unlocking them as you play.2) Create an extra save right before collecting the final piece for abyssal armor. You'll need to load that save and recollect the final piece everytime you want to start a new game with the abyssal armor.			"

												An often underlooked 3rd Person Action-Adventure game, with very satisfying combat, some open-worldy(ish) exploration and a gorgeous art style. Unfortunately this game also has one pretty major flaw/bug... Achievements. Or rather, they don't work properly. I HIGHLY recommend closing Steam entirely and re-opening it before launching this game (same goes for if you tab out) if you plan on getting every achievement in this game, or else many (for some unknown) reason may not unlock, forcing you to replay that section. It is also worth noting that I played this game with an Xbox 360 controller due to it's genre, and found the overall experience very enjoyable.Worth it, but not at full price.			"

Cool Animation but the videos is kinda bit laggy. but its okay.. the story is good and all characters in the game are totally awesome.I suggest that you buy the darksiders franchise pack because after playing darksiders 1... the ending is a total hang..and play the darksiders 2.. you will totally love the game.you will also love the puzzels, ENEMIES, character, weapons, effects, and itemsBUY!

I would recommend a xbox controller though as its easier to play with one. I did finish it with M+K first time but was far more fluid with controller.			"

												We have a hopefully first out of four hack and slash games with a story so marvelous you'll be hooked up to your screens from the second you start the game until the end of it. I love the world design which has that special end of the world touch. It has every right to look that way since the story takes place in a time of war between angels and demons in which only the four horseman stand vast in the balance of the world. Story alone is worth every penny of this game. The main character of this game is War. The Badass horseman of the apocalypse which will be one of the most memorable characters you have ever played. The part I dislike about the game is the combat system. You have a massive amount of different combat moves from which you'll end up using only 2-3 in repeat. The other problem with combat system is that War is kind of slow. His moves are sluggish which give enemy a lot of space to break your attacks. Darksiders is a game you should have in your library thought it's a 7.5/10.			"

												Okay here we go. What can I possibly say about this game. Let's first start and say this game is fun. The controls are smooth and tasteful. The gameplay is fun and insightful and the story is quite intriguing. Now the bad....WHAT THE BLOODY ♥♥♥♥ IS THIS! God of War came out in 2005 and Darksiders came out in 2010. Now this is a good game but I feel as if this is ripping off the hype of the God of War series and before that Devil May Cry and before that, even though there wasn't much of a hype, the Legacy of Kain series. Everytime I play this, I want to just play Legacy of Kain Defiance, Soul Reaver 1 or 2, Blood Omen 2, or even the orginal Legacy of Kain. I just don't get into the game like I do with God of War or the Legacy of Kain series. More so Legacy of Kain. It is worth a buy and is so worth playing. It is fun, addicting, and just plain good ol fashion sending godless heathens back to hell. However; I can't figure out why I want to play the Legacy of Kain series more than this game. Maybe it's because I have a childhood feeling towards Legacy of Kain or if I prefer the story more. Maybe it's because I feel drawn to the characters more.  But maybe....just maybe....the Legacy of Kain series is just better.			"

												Darksiders is a reasonably good game with a bad PC port.  I suggest getting it for a console.  The camera can be frustrating (and has caused some to rage quit), but the open world action and upgrade system is enjoyable if you can tolerate a bit of grinding for resources.Don't expect this game to run well.  It will be choppy.  There will be no video settings other than resolution.  For most of my play, I had my old video card forced to display a smorgasbord of effects at 800x600.  I upgraded from a Radeon HD 3650 to a Radeon HD 7750.  The game was still choppy, but I upped the resolution and it ran just as well.Do not play this game for achievements.  They often fail to register.  If they're really important to you, make sure to save right before so you can try again.  I didn't even get my endgame achievements.  Whats worse is that the game failed to register the armor I collected.  That really hurt because it was supposed to be available on my next playthrough.Darksiders is another game that I ruined by grinding for things I don't need.  This is especially true since I didn't use anything other than a plot item in the final battle.  My weapons were fully maxed.  I finally gave up on my wrath abilities after maxing out two and getting the others one level shy.  I played in spurts over many months trying to complete chores that wouldn't even be registered for achievements.  All I had to do was warp to a location, ride my horse a bit and smack the end boss around.Whatever my complaints, I'd take Ruin over Agro any day. ;)			"

												Finished Darksiders on Oct. 11th 2014.This game is fun. You play War, one of the four horsemen … to bring devastation on the world. And, oh my, you do. Hell is loose, the angels and daemons are fighting each other and in the middle is mankind. Well, mankind: not long.Soon you find yourself tricked and are “accused” to have been showed up at the wrong time, since noone actually has called for you. You are brought before the cosmic council and you are given a second chance to remedy your “failure”. You are sent back to earth to only find out that centuries have passed since you have been trapped. You are weak and lost all your powers (and your horse). Further more, the council decided to attach an enervating spirit to you which watches every step you take. Step by step – level by level – you regain your powers and abilities back (and finally your horse too). You figure out who is behind your imprisonment and manage to take revenge. It’s a road movie in a post-apocalyptic world roamed by daemons and angels alike fighting each other … and you.The action is pretty cool. You jump, swim, run, crawl, climb, etc. Fighting has some nice moves and as the game goes on you learn new skills and weapons. It really is smooth. The graphics are comic style nice and pretty to watch. The riddles range from easy to pretty awesome. And after learning new skills and abilities you tend to go back to levels you already cleared since you might now discover new places and spots you haven’t been before lacking the ability to fly to these places or even teleport (!). This game has looting features you get hooked on.War is a cool character. … who is lost in a cool though confusing world.The setting has some real nice touch. The world is filled with angels and daemons of all kind fighting each other and you’re fighting all of them. Some boss monsters are huge and some are pretty tough. Still one question remains: why I’m doing all this? What’s the point? The “mighty” council is a bundle of idiots easily fooled by a child or they deliberately sent War to prison … for what? Daemons and angels are fighting because … they don’t know what else to do? Yes, the overall action in the game is very addictive but the story could use some improvements. It seemed that some boy child fantasy has gone wild and just stopped at the point when one starts to justify all the action and reaction the characters in the game perform. “It’s there because … it’s just damn cool, isn’t it?”Finally the controls: I played with my XBox controller on PC. First it starts all nice and easy. Pretty simple and clear. But as you learn new skills, abilities and weapons you find your controller overloaded with zillions of different moves and actions you can do. At the end I felt having about ~40 different key combinations to choose from. And as such I sometimes ended up jumping and flying around before I got the right keystroke to actually hit my foe. This is simply too much.Still, a very pretty entertaining game.7/10			"

												Great game, great story and enjoyable gameplay, maybe only Black Thorne feels apart from the rest of the game, constant puzzles and few fights that break the pace of the game and give you a boring feeling that sometimes may prevent you from completing the puzzles that arent that dificult if you pay atention.Boss fights are engaging, even after you find their weak spot, and sometimes rewarding when youre so close to die but still manage that last blowh.Darksiders is old game, but still teach some new ones how o make a fun game last more that few hours.

												For what I originally thought was a clone of God of War, turned out to be equal to, if not better than what I had expected.The style of the game. The free-roam layout. Adventure. Puzzles. Combat. The soundtrack. Everything was great.And though, I can't denie that War's armor really reminded me of a cross between The Overlord (Overlord I & II) and a Space Marine. This is not a bad thing, if anything, it makes him more awesome.There were a few hiccups here and there, glitching through the floor or stuck in walls, but that seems to happen in most games recently so don't let that put you off.I beat the game in a little over 25hrs, but I didn't get all of the items, so I'd say if you do, the games at least 30hrs long.Definately recommend this game. The story is really well done. Graphics are decent (not that they really matter to a game) and all in all, Loved it.9.8 out of 10 from me.(minor glitches = 0.2 less)			"

This is one of my absolute favorite single player games and definitely in my Top 5 Best Games of All Time. I hope others get as much enjoyments out of this game as i have. Abyssal Armor, Forging the Armageddon Blade, Collecting all Life/Wrath stones, Collecting all artifacts and searching hours all over again for all the Weapon Enhancements, here i come! This will always be one of my absolute favorite games and there's really not much more to say about it. 11/10, I would definitely recommend this to any gamer.			"

												Wow! I had picked up Darksiders expecting some kind of God of War clone (which it is to some degree) and a so-so experience, but I was totally blown away. The story is actually good and there are some prominent voice actors that you may recognize (such as Mark Hamill as the voice of the watcher) playing important parts here and there. Gameplay-wise it’s basically like GoW with a lot less QTE plus a generous helping of Metroid Prime.A good chunk of the game will have you using various new items and techniques to explore the environment, unlock areas, find upgrades, and solve puzzles in order to advance. Fast travel is implemented in a unique fashion where you enter serpent holes e.g. mini-levels where you run over appearing platforms, giving a bit more of a feeling of going somewhere than just instantly appearing at another location. The controls are pretty solid and I only found myself struggling with them when trying to get war to jump off of climbable walls or when trying to get him on his horse (it doesn’t always respond right away). The AI seems to range from really aggressive to pants-on-head ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ depending on the strength of the opponent (small fry will casually stand around as you slaughter their teammates, big guys, not so much). Puzzles in Darksiders are generally more of a matter of finding all the components as some of them have critical parts hidden from plain sight. They’re pretty much just enough of a challenge that it isn’t a cakewalk but still enough to give you the satisfaction from solving them. As far as finding secrets, the game gives you various items that can either highlight their location on specific maps, or one particular enhancement that reveals ALL secrets on the current map (it’s an easy to find enhancement too). Overall I have to say I was pretty satisfied with this game and can’t think of anything really bad to say about it so I’d definitely recommend it to anyone who likes action games with a bit of exploration involved.

												This is one of those games that you have to give a chance, cause you won't likely fall inlove with it immidiately. To my surprise though I liked this, more than the sequal.Has many clever puzzles and enjoyable boss fights that each have their own gimmic to win. It's sort of like a gorey zelda clone.The biggest issue I had with this game, was that I constantly felt under powered. The lowest level enemies take several hits to dispatch until the end. Didn't really find myself using anything more than 2-3 moves and the default sword  the entire game. Would really of liked to see more useful unique weapons as you progressed to replace it. There are other weapons, but their usefulness is debatable.WARNING:1) There seems to be a bug for some, where you have to restart steam everytime you play or you won't unlock achievements. So make sure you're unlocking them as you play.2) Create an extra save right before collecting the final piece for abyssal armor. You'll need to load that save and recollect the final piece everytime you want to start a new game with the abyssal armor.			"

												Darksiders is basically a personified Zelda just for adults that features a brutal and gritty world, a fluid combatsystem,outstanding voice acting(Big shotout here to Mark Hamill.He nails it as the watcher)excellent staged and cinematic bossfights.While maintaining a gripping story around the protagonist War ,one of the four apocalyptic horsemen ,who got falsely accused unleashing armageddon on the human race.Now he is given the chance to find the true wiredrawer and thats how his crusade begins.

												This game is much like a Legend of Zelda in terms that you go into dungeons, find chests with different items to complete different puzzles, etc, etc... The MAIN difference is that this game contains a lot more violence than any Zelda game as you are War. one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse, and you wield a gigantic sword to slice and dice anyone and anything that comes acrosss your way. Very entertaining, with awesome characters and models. The only ""but"" I can think of is the fighting. While you can have different weapons and different abilities, I believe the easiest and most effective combos are easy to find, which make all the fights kind of the same.			"

												I'd give this game an 8/10 but for the main character for being the bamf he is the game gets a 9 out of 10. Been one of hell of a ride, entertaining story, and interesting characters. Love the combat system even if I find it very tedious. People liken this to the god of war and Devil May Cry series, I can see it that but I dont know if I see it better than those two series. Combat seems to be forced and a quick way to end it is to smack down an enemy enough and quick kill it (locking yourself into animation and see war obliterate the enemy). For me this combat mechanic doesnt do much for me. Looking forward to booting up Darksiders 2 once I get all the collectibles in this game!			"

												Welcome to the apocalypse. You play as War, one of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse. He isnt particularly interesting, but he knows how to kick♥♥♥♥♥and beat down. Darksiders plays smoothly, looks sharp, sounds great, and provides about 15 hours of single-player content. There is a lot of content to back track through and plenty of puzzles to solve. This is a post-apocalyptic setting, and the world feels just as dead as you might expect to be. Those that walk the surface are demons and monsters, which makes sense within the fictional confines of the game world. Darksiders is a good game and definetely worth checking out.			"

												I had a lot of fun playing this gameFirst thing you notice when you jump into Darksiders is the cool, satisfying combat style the game has. War has a variety of moves, and the controls for the moves aren't very hard, but you still need to memorize them and be quick with your combos in order to beat some bosses and mini-games. The graphics are fine for a 2010 game, voice acting is well done, and the storyline is uniquePros:- Unique style of combat, love to execute big bosses and big monsters.- Fun boss fights- Solid graphics, could be better- Good voice acting- Some really cool environmentsCons:- A lot of puzzles- The game is quite linear, if you miss an important chest, you won't be able to get it at all.- A couple random frame drop spots in the game.- Regular price of the game is hefty for an outdated gameThe good outweighs the bad in this game, I'd recommend you wait to buy it when it's on sale, because it goes on sale a lot, but if money isn't an issue for you, just pick it up and play10/10 would behead demons again.

												Previous review was negative due to controller issues, as well as choppy cutscene/audio loss. I have resolved those issues. If you're experiencing the choppy cutscenes and audio loss and you have an NVIDIA graphics card, there is a solution. Use the nvidia control panel and find the options for vsync, make sure it's set to adaptive. Mine was set to allow the 3d application to choose. Darksiders doesn't choose for crap, so make the choice for it ;)Game is actually solid. Not incredibly original, but fun none the less. At 80% off right now, you can't go wrong. Get it.			"

												Darksiders, for the uninitiated, is a hack-and-slash game, similar to these in tis' calibre such as Devil May Cry series. In this title, you'll control War, one of the horseman, as a playable character. You can upgrade his abilities, weapons and durability as the gameplay progresses, by purchasing them from Vulgrim, and interactions with other characters such as Samael (Shadow Flight and Chronomancer), and the gate keepers (Shadow realm vision), etc. The action and gameplay are above average for a hack and slash title. However, one of the things you'll appreciate about this game is that there are no freebies: Its' tough and challenging, and both mini-bosses and bosses are no exception. Even on easy, prepare to replay scenes as you battle the main bosses (Notably Tiamat and Silitha, two of the chosen).Visuals: Okay. Scales well even on older hardware with reduced settings. Nothing spectacular here.Game length: Satisfactory.Caveat: The Horseman's steed, Ruin, is acquired much later in the game, and you need him to access some areas in the game. This also compounds into a second problem: Repeatability. You'll find yourself repeating sections later on as you acquire new abilities. This is a tolerable compromise, since the game length does not pack inconvenience in the process (Remember Skyrim? None of that time-packing and stretching is preent ).All in all, it was a great primer to get started on as a game, and its' decent. Overall rating: 8.7/10			"

The story behind it is not too original, but this will soon be forgoten as you really get into the action. The graphics, the combat system, and the gore!... Oh yeah the gore is what really pulls this game together.All in all, this games is addicting, furious, and takes your attachment to a game to a whole new level.			"

												War knew exactly how to do it right in this game. This is more a recommendation than a review. I've been addicted to this game since it came out. Played it on Xbox 360 for about oo atleast 150 hours probably more, collecting everything and maxing out weapons/skills. Now i plan on doing the exact same for the PC version. This is one of my absolute favorite single player games and definitely in my Top 5 Best Games of All Time. I hope others get as much enjoyments out of this game as i have. Abyssal Armor, Forging the Armageddon Blade, Collecting all Life/Wrath stones, Collecting all artifacts and searching hours all over again for all the Weapon Enhancements, here i come! This will always be one of my absolute favorite games and there's really not much more to say about it. 11/10, I would definitely recommend this to any gamer.			"

												Darksiders is a really fun game while not as good as 2 the story is still great where War is punished and has to do many things with this guy following him. Although at the end it really becomes Portal because you have to jump through and shoot tons of portals and there is almost no fighting once that happens, especially when you must free this captured angel by going and killing three giant rock monsters in 3 different locations. Which by the way, each takes at least 45 mins each because the game transitions to portal and makes you solve a bunch of portal puzzels. As for getting it... I would rather get Darksiders 2 it is better in every way.			"

												I almost passed on this game because I could not get it to run. Eventually following the troubleshooting guides, I did and I am very glad I took the time to do this.Darksiders was a very solid action game. The gameplay is similar to God of War and the Batman Arkham series. While the textures and character may lack detail of other games, the action is fast, the framerates are extremely high, the voice acting is superb, and the story is decent.The combat system is interesting, at first it seems if you mash the attack button (a controller is pretty much a requirement for Darksiders), you will kill everything is sight but this quickly becomes not the case. You need to be more careful, dodge, avoid, and counter. A full frontal assault rarely works. I do prefer the Batman Free Flow combat system though and it allows for endless combos a much more fluid experience.To finish the game game you're looking around 13-15 hours, more if you plan on exploring every nook and cranny. I would go 8/10 for Darksiders.			"

												I usually don't play this type of games, but thought I'd try to play something different for a change. Maybe that's also the reason why I liked it so much. This game got me captivated from the first seconds, thanks to the constant epicness of the the game universe. The gameplay is also breeze. There are large number of different moves the player could make, which looked a bit intimidating at first, but in the end a set of few moves is enough to get through most fights (at least in normal difficulty). All boss fights were manageable after a few tries.Yes, there were also plenty of downsides. The console port is of quite poor quality. The keyboard+mouse controls work well, but the keybindings are a bit strange at first. The game crashed quite a few times and also features a very annoying bug where steam achievements are not registered unless you restart steam before playing the game. Running around the map also got boring towards the end. Still, you can live with these and the game is definitely worth playing.			"

I got it with a bundle and feel like I got more than 5 bucks worth of fun out of it.			"

												Darksiders ReviewAs a player who has reached 100% I can say with ease that this IS a fun game!for people who like hack & slash like devil may cry & god of war, those people  will easly enjoy this game.this game is more set on story then on repetitive, so keep that in mind. you'll have your occasional crash from time to time but it's not like it's the end of the world thanks to the autosave.there is a known bug with unlocking achievements but this has not been adressed so just google it.other than that, i do recommend this game for people who like singleplayer or hack & slash or people who enjoy a story game :)			"

												Nobody that I knew had ever heard of this game when I discovered it in a little Game shop in Cambridge. But hey, nothing else to do so I decided to try it out. Well, this game was like an enlightenment for me. It was one of my first Hack n Slay games that I ever played and it was sooo good and it is now. I rebought it on Steam (I bought it earlier for console) to enjoy it on my PC and besides the bad key controls (which can be overcome easily with a controller :)) it is one of the best Hack n Slay games out there. The storyline is interesting as well, nothing special but very well-implemented. I have nothing more to say about this game except that everybody should try it out because otherwise you would miss a masterpiece of Hack n Slay.			"

												Great game to be honest, Except the gameplay wasn't as fluid as one would like, the dodge and block mechanics are just terrible. You are never told if block works against certain stronger bosses but it seems to do nothing at all. Also the dodge does♥♥♥♥♥♥all as you can rarely evade attacks, As soon as an attack animation begins on you even 3 dodges to the next direction won't save you. Its a bit annoying. Then the annoying part is constantly running back in the game's levels and revisiting the same old parts over and over through boring running. I'd give it a 6.5/10 It definitely has its fun moments but the game in general had some annoyances.			"

												Welcome to the apocalypse. You play as War, one of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse. He isnt particularly interesting, but he knows how to kick♥♥♥♥♥and beat down. Darksiders plays smoothly, looks sharp, sounds great, and provides about 15 hours of single-player content. There is a lot of content to back track through and plenty of puzzles to solve. This is a post-apocalyptic setting, and the world feels just as dead as you might expect to be. Those that walk the surface are demons and monsters, which makes sense within the fictional confines of the game world. Darksiders is a good game and definetely worth checking out.			"

												Needless to say, I really enjoy that game, I came to it pretty late but am on my third playthrough on a row, going for achievement and trying different fighting styles (enough possible improvised combos to do so). Bit repetitive at time, the storyline didn't make me jump out of my seat, it's very blockbuster action movie like, but what do you expect ? It's an action/beat'em all. At least, there is enough to justify the following chapters under the same franchise, which is more than usual already and even a ""twist"". Very fast paced, slightly gore, with an excellent gameplay, War is a badass anti hero.No matter what is said about achievements, if it didn't unlock the first time, reload a save or play a new game and it should be solved focusing on it, it worked for me, should for everyone else.Try it once, enjoy dismembering your ennemies, it will be hard to not play through it all.

												An original IP that is based on the 4 horesemen of the apocalypse. Similar to the Zelda franchise: you explore dungeons while acquiring weaponry and items that help in reaching otherwise unreachable areas and equipment that helps in various ways from powering up to revealing hidden chests on the map. If you like the Zelda franchise, this is pretty much up your aisle. The only downside is that there are only 5 dungeons, although the last one is so damn long it might as well count as two. But for 20 dollars, the price justifies the length and originality in the IP. It should take around 20 hours to complete; so a dollar an hour. More bang for your buck than going to the movies.			"

There are tons of secrets and upgrades to find with areas you have to revisit later on to get access to previously unreachable sections if you want to collect everything. The combat is brutal and bloody and the boss fights reminded me of Zelda games, challenging yet fair boss fights where you have to find each boss's weakness. Overall if you like action games I recommend picking this one up even at the full price. It does go on sale every couple of months if you are the patient type so your call!			"

												Darksiders is a great game in my opinion. The story is great, controls with the keyboard aren't too difficult like, say Dark Souls, and it is as fun as it is challenging. One issue with the game that I have become aware of is that sometimes the achievements will bug out. To fix this, you need to make sure every time you launch the game through Steam, your Steam app on your PC must be exitted completely (as in log out and exit). Other than that, I haven't come into any major problems. The game makes you feel like a badass, and that alone should be enough to play it.			"

												Darksiders is an absolutely epic game. It plays like other third-person action games such as Batman Arkhman Asylum/City. The games fascinating story unfolds incredibly well. It never gets boring or dull but is always a challenge. Combat is extremely well done, focusing on melee rather than shooting. A lot of the game time is spent solving puzzles in order to negotiate the environment. You can get stuck once in a while, but never for too long. I eventually managed to find the solutions. One high learning curve I thought was the first boss which was perhaps a bit tougher than it should have been. The graphics are always incredibly detailed yet so smooth aswell. Superb music and sound effects. Its much longer than most other games of its type, took me well over 20 hours to complete on normal. Overall a fantastic game.			"

												I had a lot of fun playing this gameFirst thing you notice when you jump into Darksiders is the cool, satisfying combat style the game has. War has a variety of moves, and the controls for the moves aren't very hard, but you still need to memorize them and be quick with your combos in order to beat some bosses and mini-games. The graphics are fine for a 2010 game, voice acting is well done, and the storyline is uniquePros:- Unique style of combat, love to execute big bosses and big monsters.- Fun boss fights- Solid graphics, could be better- Good voice acting- Some really cool environmentsCons:- A lot of puzzles- The game is quite linear, if you miss an important chest, you won't be able to get it at all.- A couple random frame drop spots in the game.- Regular price of the game is hefty for an outdated gameThe good outweighs the bad in this game, I'd recommend you wait to buy it when it's on sale, because it goes on sale a lot, but if money isn't an issue for you, just pick it up and play10/10 would behead demons again.

												Wow! I had picked up Darksiders expecting some kind of God of War clone (which it is to some degree) and a so-so experience, but I was totally blown away. The story is actually good and there are some prominent voice actors that you may recognize (such as Mark Hamill as the voice of the watcher) playing important parts here and there. Gameplay-wise it’s basically like GoW with a lot less QTE plus a generous helping of Metroid Prime.A good chunk of the game will have you using various new items and techniques to explore the environment, unlock areas, find upgrades, and solve puzzles in order to advance. Fast travel is implemented in a unique fashion where you enter serpent holes e.g. mini-levels where you run over appearing platforms, giving a bit more of a feeling of going somewhere than just instantly appearing at another location. The controls are pretty solid and I only found myself struggling with them when trying to get war to jump off of climbable walls or when trying to get him on his horse (it doesn’t always respond right away). The AI seems to range from really aggressive to pants-on-head ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ depending on the strength of the opponent (small fry will casually stand around as you slaughter their teammates, big guys, not so much). Puzzles in Darksiders are generally more of a matter of finding all the components as some of them have critical parts hidden from plain sight. They’re pretty much just enough of a challenge that it isn’t a cakewalk but still enough to give you the satisfaction from solving them. As far as finding secrets, the game gives you various items that can either highlight their location on specific maps, or one particular enhancement that reveals ALL secrets on the current map (it’s an easy to find enhancement too). Overall I have to say I was pretty satisfied with this game and can’t think of anything really bad to say about it so I’d definitely recommend it to anyone who likes action games with a bit of exploration involved.

												An often underlooked 3rd Person Action-Adventure game, with very satisfying combat, some open-worldy(ish) exploration and a gorgeous art style. Unfortunately this game also has one pretty major flaw/bug... Achievements. Or rather, they don't work properly. I HIGHLY recommend closing Steam entirely and re-opening it before launching this game (same goes for if you tab out) if you plan on getting every achievement in this game, or else many (for some unknown) reason may not unlock, forcing you to replay that section. It is also worth noting that I played this game with an Xbox 360 controller due to it's genre, and found the overall experience very enjoyable.Worth it, but not at full price.			"

												This is one of those games that you have to give a chance, cause you won't likely fall inlove with it immidiately. To my surprise though I liked this, more than the sequal.Has many clever puzzles and enjoyable boss fights that each have their own gimmic to win. It's sort of like a gorey zelda clone.The biggest issue I had with this game, was that I constantly felt under powered. The lowest level enemies take several hits to dispatch until the end. Didn't really find myself using anything more than 2-3 moves and the default sword  the entire game. Would really of liked to see more useful unique weapons as you progressed to replace it. There are other weapons, but their usefulness is debatable.WARNING:1) There seems to be a bug for some, where you have to restart steam everytime you play or you won't unlock achievements. So make sure you're unlocking them as you play.2) Create an extra save right before collecting the final piece for abyssal armor. You'll need to load that save and recollect the final piece everytime you want to start a new game with the abyssal armor.			"

I have enjoyed it at lot except some cases of confusinon what should I do or how should I solve/ kill something.

												A truly awesome game showcasing an epic story and incredible attention to graphical detail. So much blood & gore hack n' slash fun with Steam achievements! Each boss offers a unique character and provides an impressive battle. A game controller is highly recommended to play this console port. There are two levels that are really lengthy puzzle environments which can cause frustration to the point of not wanting to continue playing. One comes very early at the Cathedral. All I have to say is stick with it. By no means is this game easy, but the experience is well worth it.			"

												I came into Darksiders expecting a God of War and Zelda mashup with lots of Biblical imagery and a cardboard cutout of ""War"" smashing things like Hulk. What I got was just as expected, aside from War, who is a much deeper character than I initially thought.The game plays out pretty well, starting easy and showing all the neat stuff War can do so you can get a feel for his power before the tutorial is over and you have nothing. From there it's a smash-em-up beatfest of demons and angels alike to clear his name, and lemme tell you the plot is above-standard for this sort of thing. When I played God of War I played a guy who was out to kill a god and damn anyone who got in his way because of personal vengeance. When I played Darksiders I saw War thinking things through, talking with people rather than outright attacking them, and his goal was to clear his name so he could do his ultimate duty as a Horseman of the Apocalypse. He's not doing this whole song and dance for himself, he's doing it to keep the balance of existence.Ultimately I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a modern twist on the Apocalypse, loves to collect things, has fun figuring out God of War combos, and enjoys a good story with a decent challenge when playing on the highest difficulty.

												The common concensus is that the 'next Zelda has come'. While I cannot agree with that, because honestly Darksiders just isn't that good, the game does come closer than any other before it. The art is fantastic and so are the voices. If anything, I'm more reminded of Soul Reaver than of Zelda. Darksiders is a solid game with rewarding combat and sensory delights. It can be repetitive and more than a little exhausting to play. And at times what it demands the player to do to progress can be excrutiatingly vague. Yet it is a rare duck and one worth playing, even if only for the purposes of demonstrating an endangered genre.			"

												What about Darsiders? : Darsiders is an Action Adventure Fantasy with a pinch of RPG but mainly Hack&Slash game.You are WAR, one of the 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse and you have answered the call of the 7 seals bringing Chaos and Destruction on Earth. But something isn't right, it seems that you have been deceived by the Forces of Evil becasue the 7Seals are still intact. Brought to the Council, you have been accused of breaking the Truce between Hell and Heaven and started the War which see the Destruction of Earth. Stripped off your Powers, you are send back to Earth to uncover the truth and those responsible the treachery and seek Revenge.The plot as you can see is interresting and keep you going as you can't wait to find out who's behind all this, the graphics are really good and most of all even if it was a console port, the Devs have made an effort to optimise Keyboards and Mouse users, and i really appreciate that.The character is well designed, the attacks options and variety of moves make the game quit enjoyable, some very nice cutscenes to keep you hook up and also huge end Bosses to test your skills.There are also some RPG ingredients and you can upgrade your character with more powerfull gears and items, souls of your victims are used as currency so the more you kill the richer you get yeah that's evil :D.Overall Darsiders is a great Action game, well worth getting specialy right now when Steam Summer Sales is on, you will not regret it, i clearly didn't.

												It's got a generic story with various blatantly borrowed influences from classics such as Zelda, God of War and Portal (?!). Aside from these flaws, the game sports a fairly impressive and responsive combat system which makes taking down hordes of enemies a gore-tacular breeze, although it does become repetitive. The level design is great however, favouring a dungeon-like free-roaming hybrid over that of conventional level systems, arguably to its own benefit. The in-game collectibles are challenging to complete and offer incentives to explore, offering a reason to diverge from the story path. The voice acting is rubbish, the story predictable and the soundtrack painfully generic, although this really is a fun, long-lasting experience, eased by an expansive weapons and combo system and a lovably gothic art direction with excellent graphics. Oh and the boss battles are welcomely grand.7/10			"

												The best way I can describe the Darksider series is an interactive book.  The lore is so creative and so good, the driving force for me to push into the game was to findout what was going to happen.  The story line was that good for me.  The overall gameplay I enjoyed, however there is one complaint.  It basically happens in the last dungeon, but the pace of the game drastically changes.  There are puzzles throughout the game, but the last dungeon got pretty rediculous quick.  I guess I am dumb, but I had to go to walkthroughs to finish the last dungeon.  The pace of the game drastically slowed down.  The fighting is somewhat challenging, but I personally didn't need all the various combos at your disposal.  I stuck with the very basics, and was able to beat the game just fine.  Which totally negates the point of having those.In retrospect, they could of done things differently to make the game even better, but I will say the game as it is is very worth it.  The cliffhanger at the end of the game is just so cool.  And it sets you up for the second Darksiders, and makes you eager to play the next game in the series.			"

												You will find that playing this game with a keyboard / mouse combination is klunky and you will achieve the success rate of getting very upset.  For 1, you must keep in mind that this game is a ""console port"". That's right! What gives that away? don't kid yourself.. during game play you will see ""Xbox360-like"" buttons for your decision making. Yes, that was my 1st clue. I semi-ignored that and continued playing without using my xbox360 controller (wired or wireless... it simply doesn't matter. That my friends, is based on your own personal preferance. I tried playing with my keyboard/mouse and I gave up. After trying to initiate my glide power with wings.. it was hard to get that to work. SPACE bar just didn't operate smoothlyand I died...A LOT!

												If you are a Zelda Fan, this is the game for you. Pretty much identical to a Zelda game: Dungeons, Hearts and Containers, Souls (Rupees), and most importantly IMO the concept of using items you get in dungeons to advance through the game and kill the bosses. There's also an element of Portal later in the game as well, so if you like Portal then that is a plus.My one main criticism is the storyline. There are 5 dungeons, and the vast majority of them involve getting the hearts of the chosen - the story really takes place during the beginning and end of the game aside from meeting Ulthane. Also, I'll mention some items are MISSABLE - particularly all items in the final dungeon.If you like Zelda, you'll like Darksiders. If you love Zelda, you'll love Zelda. Get this game if you haven't. Now. It's a 9/ 10.What are you doing here reading this? BUY THIS GAME!!!!Okay you must be bored.  So go have some fun! Buy Darksiders Today!!!			"

He's not doing this whole song and dance for himself, he's doing it to keep the balance of existence.Ultimately I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a modern twist on the Apocalypse, loves to collect things, has fun figuring out God of War combos, and enjoys a good story with a decent challenge when playing on the highest difficulty.

												The common concensus is that the 'next Zelda has come'. While I cannot agree with that, because honestly Darksiders just isn't that good, the game does come closer than any other before it. The art is fantastic and so are the voices. If anything, I'm more reminded of Soul Reaver than of Zelda. Darksiders is a solid game with rewarding combat and sensory delights. It can be repetitive and more than a little exhausting to play. And at times what it demands the player to do to progress can be excrutiatingly vague. Yet it is a rare duck and one worth playing, even if only for the purposes of demonstrating an endangered genre.			"

												I am a huge fan of legend of zelda which is why I loved this game.  I actually wasn't expecting the puzzles that this game had in it.  Like I said its a lot like zelda but with a bit more emphasis on the fighting and not as much on the puzzles.  It has the zelda game flow of: get to a dungeon > find the new item in the dungeon > use that new item to defeat the dungeon boss > repeat.  So if your a fan of the zelda games or just want an awesome third person puzzle/hack and slash game, this is definitly worth picking up.			"

I really enjoyed the story and the fighting and hack n slash element is brilliant. I like the way you progress and upgrade. I like the combat mechanics. It looks great and it has taken me over 30 hours to complete the story and get all collectibles which is tonnes of gameplay. This is a must have game imo and I am really looking forward to playing number 2!!!			"

												I was searching for a game like this after playing Bioshock series, Dishonored, Deus Ex etc. That is a game with both a good story and gameplay. That is what I (kinda) found here. The gameplay seems similar to the Batman games (not that positive for me). Sometimes, espessialy when you're getting closer to the end, the combat seems a bit boring. Yes, as you progress you encounter new, stronger units but if you repeatedly block/dodge and hit then your fine. There are many puzzles you need to solve (some would say a bit complicated), yet none of them are hard if you've played portal. There are some collectables that are kinda easy to find, thus there are not that many. It offers *roughly* 15-16 hours of gameplay (add another 5 hours for 100% completion. Gameplay wise, I wouldn't buy it for killing demons or angels.BUT!The story of the game seemed really appealing to me from the first minute! I was finding myself getting too bored to play (because it was dodge - kill, dodge - kill all over again) but at the same time I was magnetized by the story and wouldn't let go. I haven't played the sequel yet but I really look forward to.OVERALL I DO recommend the game, yet I'd wait for sales. "

												The Good: Typical stylized action game in the sorts of God of War/DMC, Tons of platforming/puzzles, fluid combat, great and personally very intriguing action. Unique hero.  Great graphics for 2009.  Memorable characters. Rewarding back tracking, and exploration. Platforming items used to defeat bosses/enemies, actually very comfortable controls for a console port. The Bad: Not enough itemization or character depth. The Ugly: Unclear objectives in puzzles, unclear waypoints to progress. Extremely ambiguous expected ways of killing certain bosses which turn into feedfests till you figure it out. Tedious mid-late end game.Was at first put off by the reviews on here of the game with people saying ""Horrible graphics, controls etc."" But I bought it, and  actually liked this game a ton. If you like action games, I would give this game a go, especially on sale. Very fun, unique, and love the storyline. Afterwards feel free to pick up Darksiders 2! 8.5/10			"

												I don't have too much things to say about  Darksiders 1 , so here's a short explanation about this game.I recommend use a gamepad unless you wanna shout and kill someone, because it's a port. FOR ME, it was a dense casual hack and slash game with EPIC things, and sometimes a ""rly? y u do dis 2 me dolan"" things. PROS + EPIC character model & environment+ Nice combat mechanics+ Good boss battles with different tactics+ More than 15hs gameplay+ Great shop system+ Lot of fun killing hordes+ Music+ Voice acting+ Cutscenes are well done+ Weapons can level up+ Collectables = Rewards <3 CONS - Impressive Puzzles for a 3 years old kid- You can't skip cinematics- Lot of bugs- Steam Achievements bugged- Not 100% open world (you need to ""unlock"" some parts)- Pixeled 2D Background- You need to run a lot *SPOILER AHEAD*  then you get a horse - That PS1-like repeated task: you need to go to 3 different ways to get 3 different items because you need to open a gate that is in the middle of those 3 paths (God please, staph)- The ""Serpent Hole"" was not neccesaryScore: 7 / 10			"

												I can't leave a review for Darksiders 2 since the deathinitive edition came out, so instead I'll talk about both games here. The first installment always make me think of the Legend of Zelda, Ocarina of Time. It has a great mix of puzzles and combat, some challenging and some just fun. The second installment is even more enjoyable with lots more great content and more varied combat and tactics possible, so it keeps you interested for much longer. Both games already looked great, so I'm sure the deathinitive edition will only make it look better. Maybe someday I'll get that edition to play through it all again. Overall, I highly recommend both games for great storyline, fun combat, and challenging puzzles.			"

Completed with neat gameplay mechanics, decent puzzles and quite interesting history and characters, it makes up for a very solid game that couldn't possibly let you down.The only flaws I can think about is that many achievements are bugged and they won't be registered.

The gameplay took the best part of Soul Reaver, Devil May Cry and Portal. The story and characters are unique with good voice acting and soundtracks.The story ends with a cliffhanger and I can't wait to play as the other three horsemen. It took me 19 hours to complete it on the highest difficulty setting and I didn't even feel it, time just flies. This should be a sign of a good (if not great) game.CONCLUSION :Recommended on full price, a must-have on sale price.PS :* To unlock Steam Achievements properly, always restart Steam before running Darksiders.* To unlock the Xbox/PS3 pre-order bonus, The Harvester Scythe, hex edit the save file.

												Finally finished this game after 5 years and several tries. The last part was tedious, but the ending was good enough. The last boss felt a bit weak compared to the others, but heh, I had the most powefull sword in the world so I guess it was kinda logical.Overall it wasn't bad, reminded me those old 3D action-adventure games like Soul Reaver and Shadowman where you progressively unlocks new powers to go on. I also love the art style, I guess that's why I kept playing instead of giving up due to the repetitivity and annoying backtracking.Gonna try DS2; Too bad Vigil had to close its doors, I wonder what they'd do with the two remaining Horsemen, Pestilence and Famine.

Even if the game looks old, it defenetly doesn't feel like it. All throughout the game it made me feel so adventurous, without discarding action and 'gore'. It actually manages to make you feel powerful without making the game easy-mode, even normal difficulty has its challenge. The story is 10/10, great plot development and game overall. I defenetly look forward to new games for this series.			"

												The reality is there are a lot of good ideas in darksiders but they are not executed well, the game is poorly paced and the story bits while possibly interesting aren't really well put together.  Darksiders really wants to be an action game but takes it's que from zelda (aka there's barely anything to do inside darksiders world).  Where everything is by the numbers and hand holdingly linear from start to finish.  The enemies you fight aren't interesting and wars controls are a bit rough, especially with the stickyness of the dodge mechanic.Pick this game up only at a discount or only if you don't mind bland slow games.  There is no ""maybe button"" so I'm putting a yes only if you don't mind playing games with serious flaws.			"

												I played this game on easy level for almost 9 hours. It's good game, even graphics is fine, story is decent, well the dialogs could be better but... So, maybe I am casual player, but in 9 hours of playtime I stuck on first miniboss in Chapter 1 Twilight Cathedral, The Jailer. Despite so many hours of trying to beat this boss I wasnt able to do so. I am sorry, but If a game on easy level is so difficult that player can't finish one of six chapter then there is something wrong with a game. I may be lame player, sure, but games should be fun not hardcore torture especially on easy level! So sadly I do not recomend this game as I wasnt able to finish it. :/			"

												I picked this game and Darksiders 2 during a sale bundle for both. The story, character design, combat and voice acting for this game are really top notch and getting deluxe editions of both games for less than $10 was a steal. However I encountered a bug after about 2 hours of gameplay (ignore the Steam tracker, it lies) that made the game unplayable since there was a puzzle that could not be finished without a sword that went poof. So while I reccomend you pick this game up do so only on sale and prepare to start all over again if your save encounters a game breaking bug. 7/10			"

Also instead of Navi constantly yapping in your ear you have Mark Hamill. Now I imagine you are feeling ashamed because you didn't jump on this incredible game sooner.

												Sure, Darksiders took a lot from the Zelda games, but DmC Devil May Cry took a lot from this game: gliding on angel wings, press V for Super mode, using powers in puzzles, killing enemies turns them into skulls which function as currency, buying little consumables in stores using skull money, ALL the moves with the Scythe and Fist weapons.  It's a good formula. Although it's 2009 release date and shoddy port still shows--there are no graphics options other than resolution and V-sync--it's still a pretty good open world RPG. The combat is great, the pacing is not great (think Assassin's Creed I). If it goes on sale, I'd say pick it up.			"

												I will consider various sides of this game, trying to be the more objective as possible.These sides are:♦ The Gameplay♦ The Graphics♦ The LoreLet's ride!♦ The GameplayThis is probably the most boring game I've ever played.It's a classic Action/HnS like God of War, but unlike the Sony's pillar this game is repetitive and predictable.There are very little combos, made only with the main attack button and the move control.There are tons of enemies, but the vast majority are just retexture of previous encounters with higher stats or in larger groups.The only difficulty is that in some parts of the game there are a few of overpowered enemies that only make the game more frustrating without adding any true challenge.The platform/puzzle sections are nice since you don't have any suggestion and you just have to find the way by yourself.♦ The GraphicsThis is very controversial.The texture of the characters are beautiful and ashtonishing, but the same can't be said for the enviroment and for the models: the ground looks gross and the models are too pointy. Even how the texture are placed is horrible.The game overall looks like an HD remake of a PSX game.♦ The LoreThis is the only point where i can't find a leak.It's awesome. A tittle too slow thanks to the gameplay, but it's how games should be played.DarkSiders in a nutshell:((-Slay tons of enemies-Drag stuff around-Slay more enemies-Destroy stuff-Slay a miniboss) Repeat x10-Slay enemies-Kill a Boss) Repeat x10I can't suggest you to buy this game for full price, but if you like the genre very much and/or it's on sale, buy it!6/10 "

												Very good game worth a playthrough the difficulty even on easy may seem hard-ish due to the amount of damage you take but to me as your progress it gets easier and once you've learned the block counter etc you'll be a lot better and the game will be a breeze. Platforming sections can be a pain the backside as sometimes you just can't make that gap and sometimes I've come across some input lag and I just fall off instead of jumping.Story is good and the character WAR you play is a cool looking character combat moves are awesome and the chance to attack with 2 different weapons on the fly work 3 if you can pull off the 4 Point Blade or his large gun Mercy.Only tiny issue I have is the annoying trials you come across 2 early on in the game and you have to do 4 parts to each so 8 parts in total, there are basically turotials if you ask me and they could have been excuted a lot better.

												I'm giving ""Darksiders"" a QUALIFIED recommendation here.  The qualification is that you should only buy it if you love games where it takes ridiculous keystroke combinations (or controller-fu if you've got a controller) to fight your way through the game.  This game is not for me.  At about the 11 hour point (where somehow, some people claim they've finished the game), I finally got to the first real boss (Tiamat) and I've got to quit.  I can't handle the keystroke combinations.  In desperation, I tried using a controller, and have the same problem (of course, that's probably because I almost never use a controller and haven't been using one to get to the point I'm at).  So, that's the big negative.  There are also a few other smaller issues with the game.  First, the menus have issues with being a bit tough to understand.  And second, there's a problem with Achievements not registering (look in the discussion forums for a work around).  But, otherwise, the game is nicely done with very high production values.  I wish I could have pushed my way through.  But, unfortunately, I can't.			"

												They took the Zelda game formula  and for a time it works, but as it goes on it just gets boring.  There is this dungeon where you have to climb three towers to fight the same miniboss over and over,  and collectibles you have to backtrack beaten dungeons just to pick up when you have the tool to do so. Combat is pretty much button mashing the attack, most enemies aren't really a threat aside from this one mid level enemy who can apparently insta kill with a laser attack while all the bosses have nothing like that. Might have been nicer with tighter design, it's alright, but it got boring.			"

												Darksider is a great game , NO DOUBT..... I have friends who says that its a rip off from the famous Play Station game god of War- but I care a damn cause I never going to own a PS at the first place. I know it is a bit late for a full length review - cause the entire gaming world has played that game way before I decided to write this review. So by cutting the crap let be put things straight what I think of the game -  Story - This is definitely not the strongest of the point for this title. The story is based upon a post apocalyptic world. :There is a fight between the Heaven and Hell and the battle field is the Earth. Hell invaded the Earth and one of the Four Horsemen, our hero ""WAR"" is summoned. But there are no sign of the other 3. what happened then ?? who and why summoned WAR ??? The story moves on from here.... Still a bit boring Gameplay -  This is a deal maker. The gameplay is very swift and the control are well optimized for the controllers. People from controller world will enjoy it. I myself is playing this game on my XBOX 360 controller for PC; enjoying it thoroughly. There are different abilities and items and upgrades that you can use according to your play style. items have active as well as passive abilities over the playing character. The environment is very interactive. And you get a tons of secrets to unlock. Coupled with the steam achievements the experience is very rich. Graphics - The graphics is well complementing the gameplay. After all it is a hack and slash RPG that is set on a post apocalyptic scene. The levels look stunning and so as the character models. The models change with the abilities that are being used by the character; for example you get a flaming red sword or you add life steal then you get a green overlay. The environmental items are well designed. But I did found 1-2 occasional glitches in the game, but I am sure that can be ignored for sure. In other words - very pleasing for my eyes. The hack and slash fight sequences are very much of an eyecandy.Overall the game is a must play for RPG fans, hack and slash fans and should be played by any gamers, so to speak off. I got the bundle Darksider 1 and Darksider 2 together - icing on the cake.Go buy the game and play it ..... I hope that you will enjoy it as much as I have.P.S. the in game audio is awesome too :)			"

												EDIT:As of now after encountering all these obstacles and finally being able to play again I feel I'll redo this review slightly while I still dislike the gameplay and technical state this port is in. I will say this game still has been very fun and sorry if I didn't make that as clear in the original, this game was running the meh opinion and with only 2 options it was hard to pick but will the frustration with some of the technical issues I chose the latter. However I'll revise and give it a recommend because I was able to actually continue on and finish it.This will be the first game I don't recommend and for good reason. While the game itself is enjoyable and awesome (makes the cons even worse really) is the fact that the game is not very stable or reliable and Im referring to gameplay stability rather than actually running the game. There are some bugs which can screw you over here and there but while playing I brushed them off, however the straw that broke the camel's back was the irreversible literal game breaking puzzle bugs. I made it as far as turning in the four hearts and was backtracking for collectibles/armor/shards etc. While doing so my character is now forever locked in the Hollows because of the train puzzle. Ther is no physical way of me leaving the dungeon now and I really didnt feel like giving up another 10hrs of my playtime to just finish the things the game had broke for me. 5/10 phenominal game, terrible pc port			"

												If you love Zelda like I do there isn't really much choice if you want a similar game on the PC. So you're stuck with Darksiders really. It's pretty good, the graphics are decent (I still have a feeling it lacks something, I don't know why) and the dungeons are pretty cool and cleverly made. One thing I didn't really enjoy was the God Of War-like combat. There are just too many fights (I don't mind bossfights obviously) and it just felt like button mashing all the time. What I'd rather see is an 'open' world where you can explore things, yes, just like Zelda. So, for Darksiders 2: less combat, more exploring. Give us that and it will be a brilliant game ! This is a good start nonetheless, give it a try.[Rating: 86/100]			"

												The start of this game is fairly slow, introducing you to combat and the world and therefore drags a bit as there's really not much you can do in terms of combat initially. You earn more weapons and techniques for them throughout the game and the battle system eventually becomes quite well fleshed out. While not on par with Bayonetta or the later DMC titles, it's still got enough to work with that it can be fun.Once the game introduces you to the dungeons it becomes a lot more fun and interesting and the first two dungeons are great, rivalling some of Zelda's best with some good bosses to round off the experience. Unfortunately the game begins to fall flat at around the halfway point with the latter two dungeons being much less interesting and the bosses being a bit lame. There is no final dungeon and the final battle isn't very challenging or engaging at all. To top this off, there's a bit of padding before the final dungeon which is really just backtracking and busywork, not aided by the poor map system.The story is there but it's not something I was really invested in. I don't really care much about the characters and there weren't any great moments.Overall I'd say this game is probably worth a play if you're into Zelda and want something that's similar but changes the formula up a bit. While it does dip towards the end, I feel that the first two dungeons at least are worth playing the game for if you get it cheap.			"

												Darksiders is a combination of spectacle fighter and puzzle-platformer with some RPG elements thrown into the mix, a combination which works very well. The story is interesting, the setting and atmosphere are great and the gameplay fun. Although marred by some PC port issues, it remains a very good game.			"

												I'm giving ""Darksiders"" a QUALIFIED recommendation here.  The qualification is that you should only buy it if you love games where it takes ridiculous keystroke combinations (or controller-fu if you've got a controller) to fight your way through the game.  This game is not for me.  At about the 11 hour point (where somehow, some people claim they've finished the game), I finally got to the first real boss (Tiamat) and I've got to quit.  I can't handle the keystroke combinations.  In desperation, I tried using a controller, and have the same problem (of course, that's probably because I almost never use a controller and haven't been using one to get to the point I'm at).  So, that's the big negative.  There are also a few other smaller issues with the game.  First, the menus have issues with being a bit tough to understand.  And second, there's a problem with Achievements not registering (look in the discussion forums for a work around).  But, otherwise, the game is nicely done with very high production values.  I wish I could have pushed my way through.  But, unfortunately, I can't.			"

												Well this was fun to play if you are into the hack and slash style of playing. I reminded me of the Castlevania Lord of Shadows kind of fun. Once you get used to your controls, the game is pretty good. Though you may have to resort to watching YouTube video on walkthroughs and how to deal with certain situations, it's not always obvious on what you have to do like fighting Tiamat. It's not a boring game to play since you have to go through many different places, like the desert, the water, underground sturctures, lava pits, etc... the different environments and different bosses you fight keeps things interesting.The only downside I saw is that a few achievements that should have been unlocked, did not unlock. Could be a bug, but it doesn't affect game play. So it's up to you on how annoyed you would get by not getting an achievement you are supposed to get. Perhaps when I try on the second time around, it will unlock.I quite enjoyed it myself that I went and bought Darksiders 2. I will be playing Darksiders again in the future it was that good for me.

												Coming from Dark souls, the combat in this game feels MUCH MUCH more boring. Basically, with the sword, you spam (X), and occasionally, whenever you fancy you can hold (X) to do an artorias flip.  And even with the tweaks and a controller the input feels incredibly laggy and inresponsive, which makes dodging enemy attacks very frustrating. You'd figure that in an 'action' game at least the actions will be good, but apparently this is not the case.Anyways, if you get it from a bundle by all means try it out for yourself but I wouldn't recommend this. I'm probably not going to finish this either cause there're much better games out there.Also, terrible PC port, NO ♥♥♥♥ING GRAPHICS OPTIONS AT ALL! You can only change resolution, V-sync and brightness, that's it. V-sync also doesn't work and you have to use the NVidia Panel.			"

												If you don't mind solving puzzles in an action-adventure game, then please skip my review and buy this game. Darksiders runs smoothly, has great art style, fun and brutal combat and a cool sword.BUT if you're not into puzzles, then this game might not be for you.At first, the game feels very much like an epic metroidvania God of War, which is cool. There are puzzles here and there and that's fine.But later in the game, the dev got too carried away with puzzles and the balance shifts heavily from action-and-puzzle to puzzle-and-puzzle-and-puzzle-and-puzzles. I don't mind repetitive combat and weapon/skill upgrades that don't evolve to anything much. However, running around trying to figure out seemingly endless stream of puzzles with not enough actions in between isn't something I expect from a guy named War.Again, if you like a lot of puzzles in your action-adenture game, then you'll have a great time. But this isn't for me.			"

												Brotastically weak story around a cheap button masher with poor mouse and keyboard controls that feels like a cheap no-effort port from console play. Half-effort level design and triple-A design by committee game that I regret purchasing. If you just want some mindless controller game where you beat things up for no reason, this isn't the worst option out there, but there sure are better.			"

The upgrades become stale and not worth the playtime at endgame. I'm already thinking of starting Darksiders 2 without finishing the first.This game reminds me of the  God of War series with almost identicle gameplay and graphics style. It has a good story about a war between Heaven and Hell,and is fun to play.Originally released for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in January 2010.

You play as War, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.As the story goes,someone Disturbs  the balance between Heaven and Hell and War gets the blame. The Horsemen are supposed to only be Summoned when The appropriate Seal for each Horseman is broken, although  something summons War without breaking the Seal that summons him.Gameplay-Hack and Slash button combos,when you do enough damage to a foe an input prompt (B) for a finishing move will pop up over their head. You hit the button and it kills the enemy with a short animation. Darksiders provides about 15 hours of single-player content.I've been playing 20+ There's lots of gear to collect, weapons to upgrade, combos to learn, and special items to find. This seems to be from the era when games were still fun before online multiplayer FPS flooded the market and  all of the Developers pumped out  mostly FPS's, I wish DEV's would return to making more games like this.-Anyone out there remember any cheat codes?Highly recmommended :ss13ok:ːLaserBeamː ːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamː			"

Obviously the subject matter is a bit on the darker side, but War is my kind of demi-god when it comes to hack-n-slash beat em' ups. Combo system was a bit lacking but with patience you can pull off some cool stuff. All round fantastic game that desperately needs a sequel.			"

												The most tryhard hero ever (can't even speek a word without trying to speak extra grim while giving the impression he is getting tortured right at that moment) in a very unimaginative story (apocalypse, demons and stuff) goes on an endless quest to fetch stuff for some demon or something. He can also fetch other stuff.I mean, i can understand this game is not about story, but it all feels like a careless hull for the actual heart of the game: The Combat. Unfortunately the combat is not that good. After having played games like Dark Souls and DMC 3/4/Reboot, the combat is just a lot worse than all of those and just does not feel exciting imo.The enemies patterns are very easy to learn and once learned you just grind down the health of the bigger enemies / bosses (the smaller enemies can be pretty much ignored.) An exception are the angels (in groups), which are actually interesting to fight because of their ranged attacks, but that does not make up for the rest. Hit-n-Run tactic almost always works.The manual aim mode is too slow to be effective in combat most of the time. The weapon update system is very simplistic and once you have found your favorite weapon upgrade, thats it (you can only mount one update per weapon, though you can switch between 2 weapons and you have an offhand ability which can also be upgraded).There are puzzles and platform elements, though neither are challenging in any way. Instead of few bigger puzzles (which i would have preffered) there are a lot of small push-that-button or push-that-box-to-climb-up or light-that-torches-to-blow-up-things type puzzles, they arent too bad i guess. The hero can climb and swim really fast, which i REALLY liked. So points for this stuff.When it comes to graphics (which of course are outdated by now), the overall art style fits together nicely. There is only one problem: The hero. His running looks bad. He runs like a poorly animated dwarf. This adds in making his tryhard character appear quite rediculous and out of place. Bonus points in design for these big living Rock-Portal-Blockers though. Sound is okay.TLDR:Mediocre gamplay. The hero's way of taking anything WAY too seriously with his characteristics of an angry stone drains away a lot of the atmosphere the world could have spread and does spread in rare moments.			"

												It would appear that this is an open world game on some small level but it has very specific goals and you must follow the prelaid steps. While it is possible to revisit peviously explored areas, I am sure most people playing this game would have a similar experience as the next person.  I got this because I was intrigued by the storyline and while it was engaging, it was very predictable.  It is definately a controller game and plays to that genre.  I found myself looking forward to the end so I cannot in good conscience reccommend this game.  I like a game that you miss when you are done. and even want to go back and look around some.  Darksiders did not leave me wanting more.			"

												Haven't played a lot of the game (for good reasons) but I can tell you now that it's not worth it. Unless the price is like 1-3€. The controls are awkward, the graphics are questionable at best (for its time) and level design seems to have been randomly generated by an unplugged microwave. The plot is cheesy too.But the gamebreaker (and deal breaker) is that sometimes I can spend about five minutes trying to kill something because all of my attacks go through the enemy and deal no damage. And then I die because the health in the game took a leaf out of Pokemon's book, of all things.			"

												It's easy to draw parallels between Darksiders and the The Legend of Zelda series, it would be no surprise if the developers at Vigil Games created Darksiders as an homage of sorts, especially to Ocarina of Time. Here you have a doppelganger to a basic run-of-the-mill puzzle platformer that we've come to expect from Nintendo: levels with an emphasis on the elements, particularly lava, water, earth, desert, dark, and light, where the only way to complete each level is through a set of challenging obstacles and various enemies, not to mention the cliché ""third time's the charm"" when it comes to boss fights.Darksiders is a pretty solid game, it has its moments and it has its downfalls but its major defining element is its ability to deliver a well-paced experience with little tedium and monotony, as items that you collect along your journey are spread out enough to feel quite rewarding with an urge to instantly try out your new shiny device, sending you onto the next level only to stumble across another shiny device, ad infinitum. The enemies are also varied enough, and many are unique to their levels, which keeps things interesting.There is a small amount of backtracking, which is heavily expanded on if you wish to collect every item in the game as there is a large incentive to do so. The levels are all well designed and can easily be returned to due to the prevention of the dreaded ""point of no return"" that many JRPG fans would be familiar with.For me, the highlight of the game was the dialogue, simply because Mark Hamill is such a superb voice actor, as proven by his long standing career as the voice of The Joker. The sound design is pretty wicked and everything sounds as you would expect: ethereal and apocalyptic.The only disadvantages to Darksiders are the myriad of technical issues I had, whether they be glitches with the game's mechanics or bugs preventing certain situations from progressing. One achievement failed to unlock when it was supposed to, and the game crashed no less than four times in one sitting. Twice, due to alt-tabbing and another two times simply because the game bugged out. There are very limited graphical options, sorely missing is a FoV slider as the default FoV is somewhat smothering and isn't suitable for PC standards.Another personal parallel I can draw between this game and The Legend of Zelda is the drastic length of time it took to beat the campaign. I started playing Darksiders in September of 2011, finishing it in February of 2013. Similar to Ocarina of Time, where I decided to take a several year long break due to, you guessed it, the Water Temple.			"

												TL;DR: Good game, not perfect. Combat is a bit clunky. I preffer combat style of Batman games much more.So, Darksiders. Well, I finished the game, so that's already a big endorsement, however I definitelly wouldn't say that Darksiders is a perfect game.The combat is passable. I seriously don't understand the decision to put dash and block on the same button. That's just stupid. I played the game with a controller and I had huge trouble blocking attacks, either the block wouldn't register, or I dashed. I wish there was no aiming involved when a controller is the perefrable input device (however one of the bosses explicity requires aiming).Boss fights are varied, but I would appreciate the bosses to be slightly easier to figure out. I got frustrated and checked the wiki for one boss fight and one mini-boss fight (then the fight became trivial).The visuals are great. It's a console port, so the textures pretty bad, but the visual presentation definitelly makes up for the grafical fidelity deficiencies.The story is pretty captivating and well written.Overall, I would say that playing this game was a good experience (perhaps a bit too long for what it was). I would recommend this game (especially due to it's age resulting in low price), but I definitelly don't rank it anywhere near the top.			"

												Whilst the game itself is pretty good, there are some pretty big flaws. The worst is that on Windows 7 (not sure about others) the game skips the cutscenes.

* PlotDon't want to spoil to much but here's a little about the storyVery fun third person hack & slash game where you play as guy with anger problems that constantly talks as if he needs to take a♥♥♥♥♥♥ His name is War. A battle between Heaven and Hell is waging on earth. You are the balance, sent to earth to return the world years after the apocalypse and restore the world to its original shape. The Destroyer, who is the one responsible for the war between good and evil. You need to defeat him to stop it. The plot was vague to get ahold of in the beginning but gets clearer towards the end. Worth finishing the game for. Story rated 7.5/10* Weapons & CombatCombat reminded me alot of God of War. In Darksiders it was a little too much left mouse button spamming for me though. You had some abilities to attack larger groups for example. Or deal damage over time. I could live with it and play with it. The combat is brutal at times with gory finishing moves. Especially on boss fights. In the stats tab there's also the amount of demon blood you've shed, indicated with gallons. Pointless but unique and fun to show how much you've slain. But I would've love to see something like a stun attack or something that temporarily gave you a shield or strength bonus. There's a couple weapons you will unlock while progressing through the game. For fighting foes, you'll mainly use your trusty sword Chaoseater. Other weapons that you'll unlock will help you to gain access to new places where you can find health upgrades for instance. What lacked in my opinion is gear to collect that add bonuses to health, armor etc. Before realising it I already stuck alot of hours in this game and couldn't stop finishing it. I first finished it on normal and I later tried beating the game on the hardest difficulty (Apocalyptic) as fast as possible and enjoyed playing it again from the start. I had alot of fun with this game. 8/10* Graphics & EnvironmentGraphics look a tad cartoonish but doesn't hurt, you're busy fighting hordes of enemies anyway instead of admiring the graphics. The thing that dragged my attention the ruins of the apocalypse that you got to see as you played through each level. I really loved the matching environment added to the gameplay and story. It was combined very well. Truly, a hell on earth. Lastly the puzzles were fun and often hard to figure out. After beating the puzzles finally, they seemed pretty easy and were even easier to memorize. 9/10Overall: 8/10[/b] "

												I was a fan of the second Darksiders so I thought the first.I found a game that was simply ""alright""The controls worked well, It was technically sound, but that's all I can give it. It's so much more bland than darksiders 2. Without going into too much detail I'd have to say that if you aren't already a fan of the first one, just go ahead and skip over it and play darksiders 2. And who knows, maybe some developer will pick up Darksiders 3 since THQ went bankrupt.			"

												I'm not a big fan of the slasher/puzzle type games, and Darksiders is no different.  Currently still playing, I find the game way too long - one that should have ended with the defeat of Straga; yet I am still traversing all the levels again looking for the armageddon sword.However, there are many good things worth mentioning about Darksiders (opinions set aside) :- challenging game play, even on easy setting- tonnes of action, puzzles range from easy to difficult- lots of jumping and exploring- great graphics, especially the big bosses- love the premise, heaven/hell join forces to battle evilMinus :- camera clipping issues- sometimes jumps must timed right or you die - leads to frustration- I tried with an 360 controller, and once it is plugged in, the game will only recognize the controller.- would have been nice to include some rpg elements that upgraded the character instead of fight moves- reminded me alot of God of War, especially when climbing on the demon growthThe only reason why I am not recommending this game is because I am not a fan of the slasher/puzzle/jumping around type game.  If you are, then Darksiders is well worth a shot.  If not, pass this one up.			"

												TL;DR;Another reviewers already describing the good things about darksider. I agree, This is an interesting game. I like it. but you should be aware about the save system. save your game MANUALLY each time you want to quit to main menu or quit the game.======================================================================longer description :Are you sure want to quit to the title screen? All unsaved progress will be lostbut what happened was, it will ALWAYS auto-save your last position in the game and that is really annoying.I've kill Stygian and going to the next ""task"" ( kill Silitha ). okay, I'm following the yellow icon, passing dry roads. hey, there's vulgrim's serpent holes on the map. I'd better reload my save files and go to nearest vulgrim's serpent holes to silitha's location. okay, I load my latest save file, hey, why I have to fight stygian's little brother again? okay, I quit to the main screen. Are you sure want to quit to the title screen? All unsaved progress will be lost. it's fine, I don't want to save my last position at that point.then, I'm back to the main screen click continue and viola, I'm back to position to fight stygian's little brother. I almost hit my keyboard because of this. where's that my latest auto-save after I killed stygian?!			"

												This game is up there with some of my favourite games of all time. I only found out about it recently and it's managed to knock Devil May Cry off it's place as my favourite action/adventure game. It's a shame it never got the attention it deserves but I blame that on the publishers, a little marketing would have gone a long way.Why is it so great? Well, you play as one of the four horsemen, War. You have a reputation of being a fierce and powerful warrior and the game makes a good job of making you feel exactly that.  It makes you feel like you can take on any foe no matter how big, then it gives you a bigger one. Your friends and foes have all heard of you and they have a healthy respect for your power. To put it simply, the game inflates your ego quite nicely.The level design is top notch and each area looks different enough to feel like you are actually on a journey. The fighting style has enough combos and special moves to keep you entertained even on battles that drag on. The bosses are sort of hit and miss for me because they're more like puzzles, once you figure them out, they're quite easy. All in all I'd definitely recommend this game to any fan of the genre. Go buy it, you wont regret it.PS:I know I'll annoy a lot of people by saying this but I'd say Darksiders is better than Devil May Cry and God of War. What? Come at me kinsperson!!			"

												Darksiders is an action adventure hack'n'slash type of game. You play as War, one of the Four Horsemen. Not  a lot known is about the Horsemen, they're meant to bring the Apocalypse, so this game has an interesting take. The story isn't bad, it's very likable but perhaps a bit forgettable in the end. I felt like I was more enjoying the gameplay than the story itself. You don't really get to know the main character, which makes it harder to connect to him.The gameplay is a blast and very much alike God of War/Devil May Cry. Combat is enjoyable and you have different abilities that you can buy/upgrade. It has a lot of platforming. You have different weapons, some of them can level up. You also use your weapons to solve puzzles. The puzzles are clever and not that hard to solve, a lot of them involves timing. The game also has a few references that you might find familiar. The first real big boss can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥but once you get past you will see that the rest of them are easier. The game is meant to be played with a controller so I can strongly advice you to play with one. However, aiming with ranged weapons are a bit harder with a controller and can complicate things along the way. If you find yourself having trouble with aiming then I suggest that you use your mouse and keyboard when needed. The art style is very fantasy-esque. The game looks good and plays good. The voice acting is pretty okay as well. It's a little outdated by now but it still looks rather pretty. The bosses are huge and they look pretty awesome, it's very satisfying to take them down!I really liked this game and can warmly recommend it, it has a few frustrating parts but none that really ruins the experience. It's not a long game but it's not very short either.			"

The plot is pretty in depth; to sum it up, War, the protagonist and also one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse, went down to Earth after the demons of Hell invaded Earth, the angels of Heaven arriving shortly afterwards. The other three horsemen didn't arrive. War stands trial against the Charred Council for dooming the Earth when it wasn't time, essentially. Now War has to revert his crime by going after the 7th Seal, which is in the hands of a corrupted Angel (who I shall not name, as that would spoil some of the plot) who takes the identity of ""The Destroyer"".Plot aside, this game is great, and it goes on sale quite often. However, there is no shame in picking it up at full price. It's well worth it, in my honest opinion.			"

												I was a fan of the second Darksiders so I thought the first.I found a game that was simply ""alright""The controls worked well, It was technically sound, but that's all I can give it. It's so much more bland than darksiders 2. Without going into too much detail I'd have to say that if you aren't already a fan of the first one, just go ahead and skip over it and play darksiders 2. And who knows, maybe some developer will pick up Darksiders 3 since THQ went bankrupt.			"

												Whilst the game itself is pretty good, there are some pretty big flaws. The worst is that on Windows 7 (not sure about others) the game skips the cutscenes. Kinda messes up the story really. The other is that the controls are abysmal. They are all over the place and are not well thought out at all.			"

I was supposed to jump from a platform to a ledge, which worked the first few times, but then every time after that I would stop before I got to the ledge and just fall to my death.

												Darksiders gives off a very strong Legend of Zelda vibe with explorable enviroments, various different weapons (used to solve puzzles) and a strong storyline. I'll talk about each of these briefly in this review.The graphics in Darksiders are surely not top notch, but they have a style i personally enjoyed greatly. The enviroments are beautiful, the characters (while horribly over the top) are memorable and the soundtrack is decent. Not top notch, but good enough.The gameplay is pretty straightforward. See creature -> swing sword at creature -> creature dies. However, in its simplicity lies its greatest weakness. Fighting enemies quickly loses its appeal, since you don't have to think about it too much. Just swing, dodge attacks from some of the stronger enemies, and you're good to go. You unlock a wealth of alternative and upgradeable weapons throughout the game, but to be honest, all of them fail to improve on what your sword already does. They are, in general, so weak that there's no point using them outside of puzzle solving. Especially once you get certain unlockables, the sword vastly outdoes anything else you'll find, adding to the tedium.Now, the story... The story actually delivers. You are War, arriving on earth to witness to apocalypse in progress, only to be called back in the middle of combat to answer for starting the apocalypse too early. What follows is an entertaining tale of betrayal and redemption (though admittedly, it does not nearly have the substance that Darksiders 2's story had, and the pacing is fairly slow until you start nearing the end). In short, if you're looking for a game that will entertain for a week or so, Darksiders may be worth picking up. While it certainly has its appeal, it won't do more than that.			"

												Before I even start about this review, this game had poetential. It really did. It had a small little cliche ""Heaven v.s. Hell"" kind of situation even with a cool seven seals addition. But, it seemed to have been completely lost at the fact that this game seems to be a rough copy-paste of Zelda and God of War. I see more similaritys to God of War than Zelda (I've played more God of War then Zelda) But that still doesn't excuse it. Not only does War have a similar character look to Kratos, his move set seems to be the same as Kratos'. Not to mention the same reptitive gameplay as God of War, fighting the same enemy over and over. The ""Press E to do a special finiser"" is taken from God of War as well. Not to mention the boss fights take after it as well. Going as far as to even use three color orbs for ""Currency, Health, and Wrath"" Which any fellow God of War player may have noticed from that game as ""Health, Magic, and Rage"". Not to mention that this wasn't exactly the best port to PC and that you'd need experience to play it with Keyboard and mouse. There's been worse, but this is still easier to play with controller. The aiming for throwing items is sloppy, and kind of hard to use. Seriously, if you want a better time and game, go buy the God of War games. Don't waste four dollars on the sale for this.			"

												I heard quite a lot of good rumors about this game, but when I started I was bit skeptical. I didn't know that the game actually takes place in modern world, I thought that it would be fantasy settings, nor I am fan of bending traditional mythology. But it wasn't that bad after all, can't say the same about Thor movie which ran on TV 2 days before I wrote this. God, it was awful and not only because of lot of lore inaccuracies...Basicly it's hack&slash with some rpg elements. You kill enemies who will kindly hand you their souls and for these you buy items, moves and few spell. Since it is a simple port UI is bit limited, there is about 6 item in game but you can only slot 3, and if you want to use different ones you have to open inventory drag them to quick-slots, which is cumbersome. Also you can't cast spell with a single key you have to use two >.< . I tried playing with the controller but I quickly came back to good old mouse&keyboard, since in my opinion it's easier to play this way, I found it hard to execute dashing attack with controller not to mention aiming is much quicker with mouse. Story is decent even though it was mildly confusing for me until certain point. Also at first I thought they used names Abbadon and Destroyer simply because they couldn't thought about more cool sounding and fitting names, since both means the same,  but that cleared up near the end of the game. But well, if it was supposed to be the twist, then it wasn't. Anyway, after my skepticism faded I had quite a good time with the game. And I can honestly recommend it.PS: Warning for achievement hunters! The game has problems with steam achievements and you may not get ones you normally should. To avoid grief, save often and if you don't get achievement, restart steam and launch the game. You have to do this every time if you want to avoid ""not getting achievemnts"" issue. I missed few, which normally can't be missed myself because of this.			"

												I wouldn't say it's as good as a mainline Zelda game, but its style and combat blurs the lines between what other games are out there and what the Zelda series has offered. If you don't own a Nintendo console or have no aspirations of using emulators, this is a good game to use up your time.			"

												Imagine God of War, except with 300% more puzzles and 200% less combat. This game has incredibly tedious puzzles paired up with repetitive combat. You'll come to learn that enemies lack dynamic mechanics to where it's nearly just a hack and slash and puzzle game thrown together. Throughout the game you will always find yourself doing puzzles more often than you are fighting enemies, and when you do fight enemies its the same 2 enemies reskinned. Did I mention that the story is just packed with loads and loads of puzzles? The game also gives you 5 items to do said puzzles and you will use all 5 throughout each area when you get them all. However you can only hotkey 3 of the 5 and have to go inside the ingame inventory to hotkey the other item just to have to re-hotkey the item you just un-hotkeyed to use the item you needed for the last puzzle. It had a lot of potential with story but the story just felt dragged out and the only reason why i play the game is because I feel like I'm getting closer to the end, but then they just throw in more and more paths filled with more and more puzzles. I'm 12 hours into the game and I finally felt like I was nearing the end boss when they threw in a completely new zone without ever being mentioned in the game prior and gave me a new item that lead to an incredibly boring fight and seemingly more boring puzzle mechanic. Overall it really isn't as good of a game that you hoped it to be and it I don't even want to complete the game because of how much of a chore it feels like.			"

												Darksiders is a novel idea that has too many glaring bugs and glitches that weigh it down. The ""Black Throne Elevator Glitch"" is a more immediate example that comes to mind in regards to how the game can force you to completely restart due to a glitch the community has known about for years. Indeed, if you are a completionist, save frequently, and save multiple files. Despite having an interesting premise and some above-average gameplay, Darksiders has simply not aged well. If you can catch the title on sale like I did (for around $2), then I would say that it is certainly worth the price - just keep in mind that it can be a mess at times.			"

												This is an almost 8 year old game. And however, it stands out as one of the best of its genre.I played first when it came out, and my expectations were low, as I thought this was going to be a cheap God of War clone. It turned out I was wrong: combat was simple but satisfying, landscapes were imaginative and vibrant, and the story, while not deserving an Oscar, was mildly interesting. But what won me over was the puzzles. You see, this is in some way a Metroidvania: you can revisit previous locations with abilities you gain during your playthrough in order to get to new areas. The ways you get to use your new gear are sometimes not straightforward and there are more than a couple of clever puzzles in the game. Yes, many abilities we have seen in other games, like Portal, but when you copy things that work and are well implemented in the gameplay like this game does, then it's totally forgivable. Some people I know claim this is the best Zelda title ever, and I agree. Besides War, the main character is a total badass. When I revisited the game for my second playthrough a month or so ago, I tried to temper my expectations thinking 7 years have gone by and maybe it wasn´t going to hold up well. How wrong was I. Despite, the comparatively low polygon count of the models and backgrounds, the choice of colors and the exceptional design make them look great (this is the old tech vs art design debate), the combat without being as refined as DmC is responsive and satisfying, and puzzles and exploration are as good as ever. A sign of the quality of the game is that the company that bought the rights to the title is going to release  a 1080p/60fps version soon. Obviously if you have an average PC you should be able to play it at that resolution with no issues.Do yourself a favor and play this!			"

												Not optimized for mouse/keyboard at all. Even with a controller the controls are buggy and terrible. The game does look great, but it is not the hack and slash I was hoping for, meaning I wanted to just mindlessly kill stuff. While there is some of that, the puzzles (which there are a lot of) are pretty redundant and easy. How many swords must I move again? Be prepared to do a lot of running back through levels you have already cleared to get to the next mission point. The only real challenge to the game is poor level layout.In all, if you would like a GoW experience without the GoW... anything really, you are in for a treat.3/10			"

Once you figured out what to do the bosses could be a little easy. But nonetheless, I enjoyed playing my way through the game, and for the couple of pounds I payed for it, excellent value for money.

												In this epic narrative of revenge and redemption, you take the apocalyptic role of War, whom has been betrayed and cast into a dark fate. It is your duty to clear your name, and hunt the perpitrators whom have caused great destruction along with the Apocalypse. Puzzles, gameplay, and bloodshed merge as the brilliantly portrayed character rips through corpses and carapaces to do as must be done.			"

												Not optimized for mouse/keyboard at all. Even with a controller the controls are buggy and terrible. The game does look great, but it is not the hack and slash I was hoping for, meaning I wanted to just mindlessly kill stuff. While there is some of that, the puzzles (which there are a lot of) are pretty redundant and easy. How many swords must I move again? Be prepared to do a lot of running back through levels you have already cleared to get to the next mission point. The only real challenge to the game is poor level layout.In all, if you would like a GoW experience without the GoW... anything really, you are in for a treat.3/10			"

So glad I did it.The game reminds of Devil May Cry and God of War series, which is a great thing.I really enjoyed it.It's an old school game which deserves to be played and praised.The only negative aspect is the fact that sometimes I felt it was too much puzzles for nothing. It really raised the hours I spent in the game. But once you done it all, you will feel great.And be aware of the bug in the achievements.

												Darksiders is a masterpiece. The puzzles and game mechanics are almost as good as in Zelda (although not quite ...), but what really pushes it ahead of other Zelda clones and even some of the Zelda games is the fantastic setting and characters. I loved how beautifully desolate the world was and how they focused on a small number of powerful NPCs to reinforce the desolation. It made perfect sense to only interact with demonic lords, angels and powerful magical creatures, because on the post-apocalyptic earth everyone else dies fast.			"

												Worst port for a game I've ever come across, bar none.  If you're one of the few people lucky enough to get a copy that doesn't require a 3rd party controller emulator, then you should pride yourself on falling into a rare demographic.  Aside from the countless UI indescrepancies and complete lack of keyboard support, the game also suffers from many bugs, many of which are gamebreaking in nature.  If you are honestly thinking of making this purchase on steam, head over to the community hub, and check out the many posts about bugs and scenerios where the game simply doesn't work.  If you wanna play, but it for console.  This game is in desperate need of a patch that will never come.  Do not buy it on Steam.			"

												I've tried to get into this game on two separate occasions now, and it just doesn't hold my attention. It feels a lot like God of War, but it's not quite as exciting. The abilities you gain along the way aren't all that useful from what I've encountered, and you'll probably find yourself button-mashing your way through most fights. When gameplay is less than fantastic, I usually turn to the story to save the experience. The story seems interesting, but the stoic main character is not really a protagonist that elicits any sympathy from me, and I feel no sense of satisfaction when I further the plot. I'm honestly struggling to write this review because I just don't remember much of the game. It's not bad, and, if you've never played God of War or even Devil May Cry or the Batman games, you'll probably enjoy it. Otherwise, I would pass on this. It's just kind of ""meh.""			"

												     This game is a masterpiece with incredible art, amazing sound and excellent gameplay.  For the PC however, it does not run well.  I've seen similar problems on many forums, that the game is not optimized for PC and so runs much, much higher than recommended 3MB of RAM and suggested Radeon graphcs card.     My computer has four times the necessary RAM and a graphics card that is more than double the power of the listed and still the cutscenes stutter, audio goes out and has all the symptoms of a very low end PC running a very high-end game.  My computer runs games like Crysis and Skyrim with little effort and yet cannot run this game. :P     I have not had this issue with the second Darksiders on PC, just this one.  I'm not sure if there is an intended fix for this but, I would not recommend purchasing this for PC, play it on Xbox 360 or your PS3 (if you have either of those) instead.1/10 for PC - 10/10 for any other system. ;)			"

												It really, really, really pains me to tell you not to buy this game. I want to enjoy it--I do enjoy it, in fact--but I cannot recommend it because it constantly crashes to desktop. I originally tried to play this game with a Keyboard and Mouse, but I gave up early on when the controls became much too cumbersome. I got a 360 controller a week ago as an early Xmas present, and decided to reinstall it because it would be perfect with my new controller!When the game is good, it's a fun romp toward a bizarre Post-Apocalyptic wasteland populated by angels and demons, and you play a Kratos-lite a**hole bent on revenge for some or other betrayal that I can't remember. Long story short, it's got a little bit of Zelda mixed in with dicing an endless supply of demon fodder with your assortment of oversized steel weapons.Unfortunately, not long after reinstalling it, I discovered that it would crash to desktop every time I played, anytime between 5 minutes--and sometimes less than that, even!--to an hour. The game is about as bad as a Bethesda title on Launch Day, but it has little to motivate players from investing the patience to complete it (I'm only playing it because I have nothing else to play at the moment and am trying to clean up my Steam backlog a little bit. I figure I've made it this far, I might as well finish it).That it has little to motivate players doesn't mean that the game is bad--I'd give it a decent 7.5-8/10 if it didn't constantly crash. And the severity of the issue is compounded by a terrible save system that is governed by your entry into an area, and it will not usually save what you did in an area unless you reach a scripted monster fight/checkpoint, or move to a new area. Picking up items (with the exception of Armageddon blade pieces) will not trigger the save system, either. So if you grab that obscure Abyssal Armor piece and the game crashes--even if you saved manually upon acquiring it, you will have to do all that again when you restart the game.I have scoured forums online searching for a fix or workaround, but I haven't found one that applies to my machine (I was able to play The Witcher 3 on medium, and this game runs perfectly--except for the crashing--on high settings).As it stands, do not buy this game.

												When a game is good, I quit a round of playing it because I feel sated and find I had enough fun for now and should do something else.When quite a bit of frustration and boredom builds up and makes me quit the game, I can not call the game a good game but only an OK gave.When at some point I seriously consider either uninstalling the game because I just don't want to endure some BS anymore or search for a cheat online to get past a certain point [spoileri]Sandwormlevel...[/spoileri], the only thing I can say about the game is that it sucks.So, in this case, the game sucks.It's story may be good, the combat may feel great, it may be really fun to sometimes just slash up enemies, but there repeatedly are situations where I feel myself getting really annoyed.At some points I looked into guides to do a certain part, at one point I even seriously searched for cheat codes, after I died several times in the same BS part and had to endure a video sequence which I couldn't skip and a minute of annoying gameplay over and over again.I would have PAID for a cheat code that allowed me to fly.In the levels where you have to ride AND shoot at the same time the controls are just horrendous, you can EITHER aim, OR evade the enemies OR control your horse, but you somehow would have to do everything at the same time, which just doesn't work at all.When you aim you ride into the direction you aim, resulting in you suiciding right into the enemy.When you try to ride while looking back your horse will just turn around most of the time.The controls are just terrible.I feel that the game producers have not even the slightest idea how to make a good game.To me it seems they wanted to achieve a long playtime, but they did by having you run far distances and by forcing you to play the game twice in order to uncover every secret item.Larger enemies are hard to beat not because they do anything special, they will just do a ton of damage and sometimes even kill you right away without you being able to do anything about it.That, dear devs, is not how to make a good game.A good game makes fights interesting and increases playtimre by having the fights against bigger enemies last longer and by giving the enemies attacks that have to be avaded but won't cost the player a major part of their HP if failed to evade.Sadly the way Darkiders works is that you will suddenly die to high damage attacks because you can barely or not at all evade them.Darksiders will have you face enemies with projectiles that you can't evade and which will sometimes do enough damage to kill you right away.This will happen repeatedly.And you will have to go into the same fight over and over again and you will be killed over and over again.If the part is supposed to be even harder to beat, there will just be two of those enemies put into a room with you.Yes, you can quick save, but that is complete utter b***s***.When you quick save in a difficult part and die, the quick save is lost.Nope, no saving and duing a short part to save again and so on.You die, save is lost.I couldn't get a bigger punch in the face.I also don't have the feeling that I beat the game by having ""skill"", I beat it by repeatedly abusing an item to stun large enemies so they won't kill me with one or two attacks.That, by the way, makes at least me quit the game in frustration and boredom.

												This game is definitely overpriced (currently 19,99 EUR), for the less than 20 hours of game play it offer, including gathering of all collectibles.But even if you go over the short story, the game, while in an apocalyptic scenario, of a fight between heaven and hell, angels and demons, it's always as colorful as a little girl's pink room. And, even with that said and accepted, the most bothering thing were the voices, which failed to give the feeling that they are taking place in the portrayed surrounding. In other words, with every dialogue, I could clearly see it being recorded in a studio, over a voice synthesizer.			"

												Do not buy this game, here's why:Bad port. Clunky controls, limited graphic options, often awkward camera and my personal favorite a dead mouse. Obviously this port was made for quick cash in.You will run into a technical problems. Once you try to turn on the game it welcomes you with black screen which requires you to delete some files from game directory or restart steam. Achievements won't unlock until you restart steam and you are never certain if you are going to unlock them or not. Save file might dissapear when you're half through a game.Sound freezes for no reason durring cutscene.Other than technical failures it feels like some soul-less executive in a expensive suit came into a game dev office, ditched five most successful games over last 5 years and ordered to frankenstein it together because it's guaranteed to sell. It doesn't have soul of it's own and often feels stale and boring compared to other games. It rips off portal, god of war, legend of zelda and adds nothing new. It'll fit perfectly in my buyers remorse category.			"

												You can say all you want but in the end the game's combat is little better than bland.The common enemies can just be chopped to tiny bits using AoE attacks and the bigger ones force you to use one single tactic to beat them. Of course if you love doing the same thing over and over then by all means, this is the game for you. I quit at the Tiamat bossfight and let me explain why; in this bossfight you're at a high tower and this oversized bat fires fireballs at you. Obviously since it's flying around you can't hit it so you have to throw a bomb at it, then wait for it to get close to a torch so you can get the bomb to ignite by first hitting the torch with your throwing glaive and then hitting that you threw at Tiamat (they stick), all the while that creature is constantly shooting fireballs at you and constantly flying away from the torch. But again, if you like to follow very use very very specific tactics in bossfights with quick time events that don't feel rewarding in any way while losing feels as punishing as it could ever, then this is the game for you.

												A great story, with good characters, almost ruined by a game.I want to love this game.  The story is engaging, I keep saying 'I want to know what happens next.'  You are a horseman of the apocalypse, which for some reason in the universe of this game are the guardians of the balance between heaven and hell.  Well someone messed that up, destroyed all mankind, and framed the rider War for screwing everything.  You are War, find the party responsible, make them pay.  Lots of twists and turns on that path, you'll honestly like a few demons, give others the finger, and laugh with glee while gunning down angels.  The visuals are impressive, remember all the World of Warcraft art with all the highly detailed armor?  Remember how that game looks nothing like that art?  This one does.  This looks like that.  This is the game that wanted to be visually.  Very pretty to look at, glorious in motion especially on PC without any framerate loss.There are two problems.  First, they decided they wanted to make a puzzle platformer.  Wonderful bits of swordplay are interrupted by seriously overly long puzzle sections of tedius boredom.  Hope you like backtracking!  Seriously, you are forced to backtrack an absurd amount, and sometimes the path to where you need to be gets very confusing.  Prepare for lots of frustration before you get to the next stabby bit.Second, they decided they wanted to add tons and tons of stuff.  We're talking hey!  Giant sword!  Cool, now give him a killer boomerang thing!  Awesome, but how about a gun?  Can we give him a gun?  Awesome!  But you know every good hero has a grappling gun, give him one of those!  Coded!  Great!  Now hey... There's this game called portal, maybe we should play with portals too?  BAM!  Portal gun added!  Sooo....  Let's drop the bass, give this guy a literal warhorn too!  A little odd but, done!  Now quests for collectables that require backtracking to every single game section after you acquire all this stuff!  Not to say how annoying it is to try to use it all in combat.The controls are a little iffy, the camera likes to do perspective changes while you are trying to do percise platform jumping, which is a bit maddening.  Thankfully the game is very forgiving of the inevitable falls into endless pits, a small health penalty and puts you right back where you were this time knowing what the camera is about to do to you mid jump.  For the non platform sections?  Controls work fine.  With two exceptions.1.  The game really needs a 360 controller.  The complicated mess of all the STUFF they want you to do is incredibly awkward on a keyboard.2.  The range weapon controls are beyond terrible.  Going into aim mode makes you turn slower than molasses, and you need to hit things moving at full speed.  Makes you very thankful to get back to bashing things with your giant sword.Then there is the purchase new combos option, which most tend to fall into two categories.  Too time consuming and or difficult to trigger mid combat, or way too easy to tigger mid combat so you're always going moves that take you in a direction you didn't want to go.  Thankfully the devs made the game smart enough not to let you fly off a cliff because you were doing a combo.  So go for the ledge fights, just keep well clear of the jump button.One more note is stability.  The windows port is known for crashing.  But there is no pattern to this, all gamers report crashes at different spots with really no perdictibility.  In my experience I've had something like 6 game crashes in 13  hours.  I would say 3 were alt-tab related.  I also had a 4 hour flawless session that spawned multiple levels.  So be prepared, you will lose progress time to time.The recommend yes/no system is a bit too limiting, I'd put this game at 75%.  Not enough to tell everyone to go get it, but if you want lots of puzzles with your hack and slash then pick it up.			"

												Who is this Game For?==================People that relate this game to Zelda have no idea what they are talking about. If I was to make a comparison, the closest game Darksiders resembles is Force Unleashed II. There is not one puzzle in this whole game as far as I could tell in my play through. The game always told you exactly what to do, and if there was something that could be a puzzle in a room, the auto-camera makes sure to zoom onto objects and paths that need to be explored, eliminating any thought process that might otherwise be needed. It’s a straight up hack-n-slash. If that's what you are into, get this title.Is it good?=================The boring linear gameplay, and almost no character progression, does not exactly have a recipe for a winner. Does it have any problems?========================This is a very poorly done port. Horrible controls, no graphics options and the game has a lot more issues. You'll need to check out http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Darksiders if you have any problems. Final Thoughts!====================A laughably boring main character, uninteresting plotline, and a steep learning curve for combat doesn’t help sell the game much. The boss fights are entertaining and the voice acting isn't a marvel. If you could enjoy, say, God of War, but without the storyline, characters, or great voice acting, then you could probably enjoy this game.			"

												uggh, this game is terrible. i guess it's like god of war, but it's really bad. the story was really vague and i actually had to watch lore a minute to learn the plot. Gameplay is weak, and about an hour in you have to ride a dragon for about 5 minutes (which feels like 30 minutes). Some enemies are cannon fodder, others are borderline minibosses and having both extremes does not make it the nice middle. i won this for free. and i kind of regret it.			"

												I really, really, really wanted to like this game. Within the first five minutes killing angels by throwing cars at them? AWESOME!What I got to play of it was very entertaining and exciting. The combat was a blast. The visuals for its age, were dynamic.Then I came across a jumping puzzle and while I know *how* to do it--I *cannot* do it. The dexterity required was beyond my capabilities even when I tried with k/m which is difficult for me. To be clear, I can get by in Batman games and suchlike so it is plausible for devs to tame this down on easy mode.On ""easy"" mode [I test all games on that] the platforming puzzles do not scale down in relation to the difficulty, or scale down enough in difficulty. The combat does--the precision required to do those puzzles does not. I tried this specific puzzle more than 200 times and could not do it.I recommend this game IF you are not cognitively or physically struggling. It's lots of fun, for what it is. I cannot however, recommend it for anyone with challenges due to the precision nature of some of the jumping sections unless you want to frustrate the crap out of yourself. I'm still stuck at that broken down church and the rest of the game is now unplayable for me.  "

												Darksiders is, without exception, the longest linear game I have completed. Without mucking about trying to 100% the secret items (including what I understand to be an entirely overpowered suit of armor), I completed the game in 20 hours. With no substantial exception, that twenty hours was spent navigating a series of single-branched corridors and single-solution puzzles that felt simultaneously inorganic and unfulfilling to navigate. War is a hulking, grumpy nephilim who fancies oversized armor and weapons, action-film dialogue, and violence as the answer to every problem. Which is all of it perfectly fine- the game has an aesthetic which kept me playing along despite its derth of challenge or mechanical variety (not to mention the unfortunate amount of retreading that must be done as part of normal gameplay). But if you are not sustained by the aesthetic- and I only completed the game out of a combined masochistic streak and desire to learn more about bad video game design- Darksiders will quickly lose your attention, as War's repetoire of attack skills is limited to attacking, countering, dodging, and little else, with the vast majority consisting of mashing the X button until the enemy has either died from damage or can be executed by a special move that never varies and often takes substantially longer to perform than a death by damage would. The puzzles are generally straightforward and are less jigsaws and more mazes with a handful of steps that must be completed in a precise order before the player can proceed. Very rarely do these prove taxing intellectually, but they are often taxing of one's patience, as the solution generally becomes obvious long before the player can realize it through a series of platforming obstacles and stiffly targetted bomb-throwing or shooting tasks. The very BEST that Darksiders has to offer is in its boss fights, several of which force the player to quickly analyze the arena and boss itself to determine the method by which the boss can be defeated (there is generally only one method). Some of these drag on with the shear number of blows that the bosses sustain before being defeated, with no change in difficulty during the repetition of the fight mechanics. The first and final bosses proved to be the most challenging and satisfying. In sum, I can't recommend this game. There are a large number of superior games of this genre, mechanically and in terms of story, and $20 will go much farther with them.			"

Pros+ Interesting Story+ Solid PuzzlesCons- Incredibly Repetitive and Boring Gameplay- Tedious BacktrackingIf you got God of War and Zelda, mashed them together, and took out almost all of the good things from both, you get Darksiders. Everything in between the boss fights and the occasional puzzle is just plain boring and feels like a chore. Final Score - ★★☆☆☆			"

												If you play using a programmable mouse or gamepad. Do Not Buy!!!Does not Support gaming mice and game pads. Only Xbox compatable controllers.Only normal mice and keyboards are supported half hazardly. Just avoid Darksiders 1. It's a console to PC port robbery. Avoid it. Even if on sale.Any game you have to do work around gymnastics with your own PC files to play isn't worth playing. Or paying for.Just buy an XBOX 360. Play Darksiders on that, otherwise its not worth the hassle or download.			"

												I will write this having in mind that we live in 2016+Is this Fable? NoIs this Zelda? NoIs this Devil May Cry? NoIs this Prince of Persia, Tony Hawk, Spiderman? NopeThis game is a clone of many different games and it's easy to see that for many people. Don't get me wrong - it's a solid game, there were no bugs, game goes smooth even on notebook, cinematics looks nice for the date of release (and for now), but... It is more like Soul Reaver (puzzle) mixed with something like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ version of Devil May Cry (button smash).In short:Go from A to B, bring N parts of X, kill Y,Z, go back, return back, blablablahDon't expect anything except objectives driven by half minute cutscenes, if you like a good storyline, better don't play it because many interesting characters were just ignored - they have no background at all.Now go kill satan and bring a beer			"

												I don't know what to say for this game... but I will reccomend this game if you are hardcore rpg gamer, and very not recomend for non gamer... there are many button, very hard hint (similar to god of war but more harder), and many unecessary fight (better if in online game, but if offline it just wasting time for nothing). played to long on easy mode because of have to walk to the location, meet many stupid monster and just has less amount of story scene(the rest was full of crap scene). If this game can cut down unnecessary scene and more to the main story, it will be great like Ryse: son of rome, X-Blades, etc...			"

												I really, really, really wanted to like this game. Within the first five minutes killing angels by throwing cars at them? AWESOME!What I got to play of it was very entertaining and exciting. The combat was a blast. The visuals for its age, were dynamic.Then I came across a jumping puzzle and while I know *how* to do it--I *cannot* do it. The dexterity required was beyond my capabilities even when I tried with k/m which is difficult for me. To be clear, I can get by in Batman games and suchlike so it is plausible for devs to tame this down on easy mode.On ""easy"" mode [I test all games on that] the platforming puzzles do not scale down in relation to the difficulty, or scale down enough in difficulty. The combat does--the precision required to do those puzzles does not. I tried this specific puzzle more than 200 times and could not do it.I recommend this game IF you are not cognitively or physically struggling. It's lots of fun, for what it is. I cannot however, recommend it for anyone with challenges due to the precision nature of some of the jumping sections unless you want to frustrate the crap out of yourself. I'm still stuck at that broken down church and the rest of the game is now unplayable for me.  "

												Darksiders draws inevitable comparisons to Zelda and god of War. Its a shame that it is never as smart as the first or as satisfying as the second.The combat in bland, simplistic, overused and repetitive. You cant properly mix weapons in combos, in fact, most combos are 1 button sequences like: X, XX or XXX. If you wana be a pro try holding X for a sec. Yeah...Off course sometimes you also have to dodge, but considering how much the enemies telegraph you their attacks I can say you almost have time to check your email. And don't let me start on the ""finishing"" animations, so frequent and repetitive that got me tired of them after 1 hour of game.Overall the flow of the game is very contrived. A lot of it feels like filler, especially the underdeveloped platform segments. To make worst, most puzzles feel uninspired and tedious, riped off directly from zelda games, but without the same level of polish in its execution.There is constantly something gating your progress that don't feel like it was needed and the ways you solve problems always sound like they took triple the time they should have taken.Its not terrible, for sure, and has semblances of being a fun game on a few moments, but on the long run is boring, which for a game is almost a worst sin.

												Let me begin by saying that my dislike for this game is based purely on a personal preference: I HATE cartoony WoW-syle graphics. With an unreasonable, flaming passion.What makes it worse is that the content of this game, a war between Heaven and Hell, virtually demands a dark and gritty atmosphere. Instead you get what looks like a war between Cartoon Network and Disneyland. Is it a good game? Probably. Could I ever get immersed in it? Absolutely not.			"

												I would not buy this game or even attempt to play it through steam as they have done a terrible job of converting it. Not only can you not play it at a higher resolution but you must disable every security feature which include any active anti-virus, maleware protection and your firewall. It doesn't matter what your computer specs are there are no way to alter or reduce the demand of physical memory this game allocates to your system. In some cases if your save game file becomes too large it won't load, if you stop in a spot right before a boss fight and enter, it will freeze. If you try asnd summon either the watcher or Ruin your steed, it will freeze at times. This game is far too buggy and I regret buying it in the first place and of course it seems that steam is in no hurry to make any fixes to their products, as usual. So you can forget a fix in the future at any rate and the developers are under a new name and most likely will not provide any support for this game as it is a only a few years old.			"

												People aren't joking when they say this is Zelda-like. Besides aiming mechanics and perspective it has everything up to and including chests, grappling hook, bottles, masks and even a shadow Link battle. In that regard it's pretty fun.However this is an almost stereotypical crappy PC port. Random slowdown, cutscene skipping, horrible default keybindings and little room to customize them as well as other scattered bugs. Despite annoying me greatly I was still able to push through it and had many good moments. Which is why I'm not thumbing it down. Just keep in mind that you'll be seeing a lot of stuff in the vein of the following video I made.Also, this comes with a comic and complete OST. The game takes it upon itself to install these things to your main partition without asking you though. I enjoyed the comic. It's pretty cheesy but then so is the game. I'm also a sucker for supplemental material like this.

												It's like God of War, but less awesome (because no Kratos, of course) and harder puzzles. Seriously, what's up with the puzzles. I hate the shifting room especially because it'll took me eternity (heh, ancient immotals joke) to solve it if it wasn't for some dumb luck of accidentally figuring it out. Also achievements doesn't work as intended. Bummer. I like slamming and ripping apart inferior creatures 7/10.			"

												   I absolutely love this game. Not only is it based on the Bible but you're one of the horsemen. The gameplay mechanics are awesome and the story very well writen. The graphics are superb even and way better than Skyrim in all aspects, and should have outsold it. I think their was a patch added because after uninstalling and reinstalling my XBOX controller worked. Remember AVGN showing all the bad Bible games well this and Darksiders 2 shows you can make a great game based on the bible. Not to mention the design of characters was done by one of my favorite comicbook artist. This game has so much to give. Very awesome.			"

												Darksiders 1. probably one of my favorite games. And with nvdia gtx 660, this game has been reborn on PC. It is totally playable with mouse and keyboard, but i prefer the xbox style controller. This game is an all-round thumbs up. perfect hack/slash, with great RPG elements. The game allows you to explore to a degree without being led off the story. My opinion, its better than 2. Though i love death, i prefer this game.  i recommend both! get this game for xbox or playstation. its a great game. but the devs arent making any effort to fix the achievement problem nor game performance for PC. game runs fine. just isnt tuned properly for PC.

												I would not buy this game or even attempt to play it through steam as they have done a terrible job of converting it. Not only can you not play it at a higher resolution but you must disable every security feature which include any active anti-virus, maleware protection and your firewall. It doesn't matter what your computer specs are there are no way to alter or reduce the demand of physical memory this game allocates to your system. In some cases if your save game file becomes too large it won't load, if you stop in a spot right before a boss fight and enter, it will freeze. If you try asnd summon either the watcher or Ruin your steed, it will freeze at times. This game is far too buggy and I regret buying it in the first place and of course it seems that steam is in no hurry to make any fixes to their products, as usual. So you can forget a fix in the future at any rate and the developers are under a new name and most likely will not provide any support for this game as it is a only a few years old.			"

												People aren't joking when they say this is Zelda-like. Besides aiming mechanics and perspective it has everything up to and including chests, grappling hook, bottles, masks and even a shadow Link battle. In that regard it's pretty fun.However this is an almost stereotypical crappy PC port. Random slowdown, cutscene skipping, horrible default keybindings and little room to customize them as well as other scattered bugs. Despite annoying me greatly I was still able to push through it and had many good moments. Which is why I'm not thumbing it down. Just keep in mind that you'll be seeing a lot of stuff in the vein of the following video I made.Also, this comes with a comic and complete OST. The game takes it upon itself to install these things to your main partition without asking you though. I enjoyed the comic. It's pretty cheesy but then so is the game. I'm also a sucker for supplemental material like this.

												Darksiders had a lot of potential, but the series doesn’t fulfill it until the sequel. Yes, the environment and characters are awesome, but this game doesn’t deserve the praise it has gotten. Why? Because it fails at being the one thing a game has to be: fun. As other reviewers have said, the longer the game goes the more tedious it becomes. The fights and exploration become long and boring and the game becomes a chore. Pass and buy Darksiders II instead.			"

												It's like the Legend of Zelda and God of War had a baby. Excellent combat, although the camera gets extremely wonky at times, interesting story with a few plot twists thrown in for good measure, excellent and varied boss battles, except for a certain teleporting wench that we won't talk about ever again, interesting puzzles that are difficult enough to keep you engaged, but not too hard so as to leave you stuck for 20 minutes staring at the same wall, and the best part? Unlike God of War, where the main protag tries too hard to be a badass and ends up being a redundantly despicable piece of scum, the protag here is actually a genuine badass, who doesn't murder things simply for having their toes in his way. 8.5/10Also, just a heads up, this games setting and story heavily twists Abrahamic religions, so if you're sensitive about consorting with demons and pulling angels wings off with your bare hands and then tossing their impaled bodies around like ragdolls, you may want to skip out on this one.

												Game is OK, the backtracking killed it for me. With no way to know which areas you need to go back for collectibles you're gonna be spending a lot of time wandering aimlessly unless you follow a guide.This game needed some serious QoL changes. The fast travel sucks. Not only do you have to walk all the way to a a waypoint but after you activate the waypoint, you also gotta run through an alternate dimension area to get where you want to go. Why? This is just a waste of time.Why are there so few hotkeys for your equipment? There's about 5-6 tools you need to use to roam the world but only 3 of those can be hotkeyed at any time.Why is there no way to hastily leave a previously completed dungeon? I went into the Twilight Cathedral in search of upgrades I didn't collect. After about 5 minutes I decided I couldn't be arsed to find my way out again. Closed the game and uninstalled on the spot.

												A decent game but an abysmal port to pc. It gets very repetitive and boring after a few hours and the graphics are bad even for last generation consoles. Darksiders 2 is a much better and interesting game. I cannot recommend Darksiders 1.			"

												This isn't really a bad game (it's actually a competent game), but it's such a generic-feeling action adventure game that it's really not worth your time when there are far more interesting games to play.  Story and enemy design is astoundingly boring, and combat is just mashing the attack button, occasionally using a magic spell if you get surrounded or turning into an invincible badass for 15 seconds once you build up enough charge.   Every once in a while things are made interesting with getting a horse or a huge cannon for a bit, and exploring hard to find areas is fun.The puzzles are just awful late in the game.  You get a portal gun which is a direct copy of Valve's Portal Gun, except the puzzles are frustrating and not intuitive.  Half the time you don't know what you need to be doing with the gun, or where you need to go.God of War is far superior to this, and although I haven't played many games of this type, I'm sure there are better options.

												Way better than Darksiders 2. Everthing has a purpose and the game is not just fetch quests. The story is complete and EXCELLENT and keeps rolling forward with the gameplay. The Zelda-esque take on the gameplay is fun and very well done. War is the motherfkucin man with a great set of moves and cool personality.Shame that the second game sucked so bad.			"

												Before I go into depth I want to specify that I did use a gamepad for this game - I strongly recommend using one and would go so far as to say to skip this title if you don't have one. It's a console port, guys. Darksiders is a game that wears its inspirations on its sleeve famously, and to a ridiculous degree. When you're traveling through a Legend of Zelda-style dungeon solving puzzles with a Portal Device, you know you're not playing a game that's focusing on being particularly innovative. That's fine, it doesn't do it does particularly well though. The dungeons, level design wise, are all threadbare. Puzzles never get more complicated than ""get past the obstruction using the item you got in that dungeon"", platforming reaches its maximum amount of complexity 20 minutes into the game, and exploration is limited because despite the expansive levels, there's very few optional areas. You're taken in a very roundabout, but ultimately linear, path and led by the nose from start to finish.Combat doesn't fair any better - it has all the tools to play well, but the way it's executed is an absolute mess. Even the Counter, the quintessential ""up yours"" high-risk high-reward move that's been a staple of decent hack n slash games for over a decade, will often be cancelled and interrupted because it doesn't interrupt a good deal of enemy attacks - seemingly at random.The moveset cops a lot of flak for its simplicity, but once you unlock the full movesets for each weapon and supplement each weapon's combos with another weapon (you can even switch out your sidearm and combo them into each other) you can get a nice amount of combat variation going on. Design doesn't support that, though, since the game has the a conceptually moronic weapon leveling system that strongly discourages using more than one weapon - the difference between weapon levels is more than just palpable. Add to that that combos have no impact on anything whatsoever.At its best, it plays like a more forgiving Devil May Cry, but mostly it plays like a more brainless God of War and it suffers for that heavily. The whole lack of finesse seeps into every corner of the game. They're terrified you'll play it wrong, or will look in the wrong direction for more than a second - puzzles will constantly be interrupted by those infuriating drawn-out mini-cutscenes which point out what you're meant to do, the Watcher is used as a device to call your attention to something that's already flashing, and many more examples. One particularly egregious example has you explore a small environment for four challenge portals, that as well as having icons on the map and having giant beams shoot up into the sky, even have Eye of Sauron-like icons on top of the beams just to be extra sure that you don't actually have to explore.Darksiders has all the tools and capability to play well, but it adamantly refuses to. On a more positive note, the environments are absolutely fantastic, I was personally fond of the character design  - despite my usual complete distaste for giant pauldrons - due to just how well done it is, and it has some of the best flashy particle use I've ever seen.War as a lead is bland, but he isn't antagonizing or unlikeable. The supporting cast is similarly lacking in character but inoffensive (with the exception of Samael and the Watcher, who were both pretty enjoyable). The story isn't particularly interesting, but isn't grating.It's an incredibly pretty game (despite the very noticeable lack of anti-aliasing in a game with so many sharp edges), and if you're looking for a stylish hack n slash and are willing to overlook a few design issues that drag it down, then check it out. I wouldn't outright recommend it to anybody that isn't looking for that particular type of game, though.			"

												I really wish this were better than it is.Negative first (since you're reading this to know why I voted it down)It's a fairly shoddy console port. Controller-oriented menus, few graphical options, shoddy mouse and keyboard control. With a controller, it handles decently, whereas some battles are literally impossible to complete with the mouse and keyboard controlsIt has both fatal [CTD] and non-fatal [restart from checkpoint] bugs that are quite frustrating to say the leastPoor level and mechanic design. These vary from small and numerous (issues with engine-based input/action/animation lag, poor mechanical decisions, getting stunlocked to death, innappropriate or inadiquate checkpoint locations, etc.) all the way to compounded and quit-worthy (I stopped when I reached a miniboss that could take half my health in one hit, did an attack that covered 95% of the arena, and would knockdown for a second or even third invariably fatal hit after the first connected)A feeling of ""Jack of all trades, master of none,"" it tries to do too much. It's a combo-heavy hack 'n slash with puzzles and platforming, an RPGesque level-up system, and collectables that are actually key to survival. There is so much that you forget half of it even exists, so there were battles it took me an hour to figure out because they relied upon a mechanic I forgot about. None of the above are fully polished, and there are many hiccups, especially in the platforming and puzzling, where little to no direction is given, and the level design is not good enough to guide you through naturally.This game is like a tutorial on how NOT to make boss fights. Take heed, game designers - these are inventive bosses with some of the most abysmal execution and unfair feeling losses I have ever seen in a game. They're not outright broken most of the time, they're just so unfair or punishing for the tiniest mistake that they echo the Famicom era of game design - play it over and over until you memorize it and time every move perfectly.On the plus side:The models and art, including the voice and music portions are nicely polished most of the time. Cutscenes were well done, the characters are well acted, and animations are polished. The story is fairly trite, but I expected no less "

												Darksiders is sort of a cross between Zelda style storytelling and quests and Devil May Cry's growth and combat system. While the storytelling, dialog, plot, art, visual style, and voice acting are all amazing... sadly the gameplay is very very clunky and the level designs are pretty bad. I eventually stopped playing this game despite wanting to finish it when I found myself in an area that only served to irritatingly waste time.I don't recommend this one in general... however the sequel is much much better.

												Darksiders is perhaps a good game, but by no means a great one. However, this poor port from the consoles to the PC is perhaps the most damaging aspect of the game. So damaging that I find myself unwilling to endure it long enough to finish it. To start things off, a Windows update from early June of 2013 has made any video/CGI portion of the game unbearable. The top half of all of these sequences is nothing, but black. While many are quick to blame MS for this bug, I am not. The reason being that every single game I own, older and newer than Darksiders, is unaffected. Only Darksiders is affected, which leads me to put most of the blame squarely at the feet of the now defunct developer. And the grand-daddy of them all are the controls. They are downright terrible for the PC version. In the beginning you can easily manage to customize your mouse and keyboard in a way that makes the controls bearable, but as you progress throughout the game and gain new abilities you will find yourself agonizing over trying to find a new way to customize you controls all over again in a way that will work. Also, Steam offers only partial controller support for the game, so the only way to use one effectively is the tedious programming through a third-party program. Perhaps if the gameplay was a little more in-depth rather than hack and slash then it would be worth it to put up with these flaws. Alas, it is not. Other features that seem to be lacking is the freedom to move around the world, and the lack of an expansive world at that. I never finished the game, but considering that the game is just only 12-15 hours long, and that I got a quarter of the way through it, I would think that it would begin to open up in some more ways. If it does open up later then I doubt you will have much time to delight in it. There are some bright spots, however. Much of what this game takes after is The Legend of Zelda franchise. The puzzles, the dungeon-like settings, and whatnot are all there. But the game doesn't do much else to differentiate itself in a positive fashion. The puzzles are too simplistic (much more than the recent 3-D Zelda games), and the world is not nearly as expansive as Twilight Princess or even Ocarina of Time. It may sound unfair to compare Darksiders to the granddaddy of all adventures franchise, let alone Ocarina of Time, the highest rated game in video game history. But if one is to compete then they must offer something exclusive or something better. The only areas where it pulls it off is the secondary-attack weapons. But other than that there is nothing but cheap QTE-like finishing moves, and tons of blood to cover-up its obviously dated gameplay, even for the standards of 2010 (the year of release). The lack of decent controls on PC, the video problems on PC, the dated mechanics, and the lack of an open and compelling world doomed this game from potential greatness to okay.			"

												To say ""not recommended"" isn't necessarily the vibe of what I want to give from this review. Ultimately my sentiments would lean more toward a neutral response, but ""not recommended"" captures my intention more than recommended does. I wouldn't recommend this game, not because it's a bad game, but because it's not a good game. It's mediocre. It may appeal to people who thought Zelda was too difficult, but that's about the extent that my recommendation goes.Ultimately the biggest problem with the game is that it's way too easy. I played it on normal mode, so naturally I don't expect the monsters to be anything special, but that's not the kind of difficulty that I'm talking about. I mean that the puzzles are way too easy and the dungeons are way too linear. Perhaps I shouldn't compare it too much to Zelda, but that and God of War seem to be what most people compare it to. I can definitely see the inspiration of Zelda on the game, but they've dumbed that down into only a handful of dungeons that are extremely simple to navigate through and beat. There are a couple of decent puzzles that leave you with a sense of accomplishment, but once again comparing it to the quality of Zelda, it leaves something to be desired.Most of these easy puzzles are accomplished by gimmick weapons that are found in the dungeon that you'll find yourself using it the most. Generally these weapons serve little practical purpose outside of the dungeon they're found, though there are a few exceptions. One such gimmick item is one that greatly resembles the gun from Portal. When I first saw it I thought ""awesome, I can portal around everywhere now. What a great idea!"" But unfortunately that excitement was stifled by the realization that you can only use the gun on a handful of orange circles. It was kind of cool going around with it, but they overused the gimmick in the dungeon to the point that it felt tedious, and they only used it a couple of times outside of the dungeon to get little secret items. The horse, Ruin, was also like this. The horse was cool when you could use him, but War is limited to using the horse in only certain areas. I had hoped that a game about a horseman would feature more horse, but the game is pretty close to the end by the time you even get him.The power glove item that lets you smash the blue crystals was neat since you could use it as a weapon, but it really wasn't that great of a weapon either. For the most part I found myself only using the sword and the crossblade (the boomerang) in battles, and the latter was still pretty weak, but could help subdue certain enemies. I almost never used the wraith skills (though they may prove more helpful in Apocalyptic difficulty). The chaos form was pretty helpful, though perhaps it made the game too easy. The story is one of the areas where the game does shine. I don't want to give too much away, but it is pretty unique, and perhaps it's the only thing I really liked about the game. The characters are decent and likeable too, though admittedly the names can be a little confusing at first. The swordplay isn't bad either, though it can be tedious at times. Maybe I had an issue with this because I never used my wrath items or other weapons, but the sword just worked better than the rest of them. Your character controls a lot like a character from World of Warcraft, which works pretty well. I only have two gripes with the movement. The first is that when you're targeted onto a character and you use your dash move, it moves your character relative to the screen rather than relative to your character. This leads to your character darting toward an attacking enemy rather than dashing to the side periodically. It would have been more intuitive if it had been done relative to the character. The second gripe is that the horseplay can be a little clunky as well, though this is a relatively small problem.The game suffers from bugs as well. Perhaps this is more situational to the player, but during my runthrough of the game it crashed between five and ten times. It wasn't super bad, but it was highly annoying. Additionally, sometimes when you're climbing on that demonvine stuff and you want to jump to another piece, it won't let your character do it, and you have to try again. Similarly, often after you land one such jump your character will be stuck there unable to move. Another glitch I ran into is that often when you try to summon your horse, it will summon him for a second and then your character will immediately unsummon him, which can be pretty annoying. One final bug that I noticed was that sometimes the music would  partially cut out and the game would sound hollow. A restart fixes this, but it's still annoying. These bugs may just be limited to a few people, though, so I don't necessarily calculate them into my real recommendation, but they're worth noting.Exploration felt pretty shallow. There were some neat areas to explore, like one area called the Drowning Pool, but for the most part there wasn't much to explore since the game is so linear. A lot of the exploration in the game relied on going back to old areas with new abilities, which was kind of tedious since it relied on backtracking rather than new challenges. It was kind of cool opening up old areas, but if you don't remember exactly where they were, then you have to go through the whole ordeal of the dungeon again, which proved to be banal, though the puzzles were precompleted by you. At least there was some sense of exploration, but as I said, what was there felt shallow.The soundtrack to the game is fine too. Nothing to get too excited over, but not necessarily bad either. Just fine. And the game could have expanded more on a certain subplot featuring a certain dapper undead, too. At least it was there at all, but the game didn't really do anything with it. It could have been awesome, but it was just left there uncompleted.All in all the game isn't necessarily a bad game, but there's nothing to make it good either. I was expecting more given all of the great reviews. I'd officially rate the game as average: okay, but nothing special. I wish Steam gave a ""neutral"" button when deciding how to rate the game, but ""not recommended"" is the better choice of the two recommended options. Cheers.			"

However if the game isn't 100% completable the product is simply not finished. Hence a thumbs down.			"

												An astoundingly poor port. Ran very poorly on my previous computer, despite it being up to spec. Vsync destroyed performance, and the screen tearing is horrendous. Tried again on my most recent, superior machine and the game not only didn't perform any better, the intro cutscene caused a BSOD and something the installation had messed with forced me to spend some hours rolling back to a system restore point to even get my machine to reboot. This has never happened before.Should you have any success with the game, I do recall play requires a controller or mouse with a really loose third button and wheel (yes, it demands players spin the wheel). I cannot recommend buying this, and if you have it, I cannot recommend installing it. If you must play it (and I do hear it's good), do so on a console.			"

												This game has its fun moments. The battle animations are cool and I always love to see games with strong art direction. Darksiders has been compared to Zelda and I would say that for the most part, that's a decent comparison. There are temples with puzzles and new weapons to collect and a big boss to fight at the end. It's a good formula.But my problem with this game is that it's gratuitous. After slogging through one too many arena-style battles featuring wave after wave of enemies... it got old. I just wanted it to end. The level of violence in this game is pretty gruesome, and going into this game, I knew it was a stretch for me. Maybe some people get a thrill out of splitting enemies in half or ripping the wings off of angels, but again, this got tiresome and trite pretty quickly.It also doesn't help that virtually every character in this game is some gravel-voiced dude whose character motivations, if they even exist, are hidden behind in-game fantasy jargon. It's been a while since I've played, but from what I remember, they have special names for all kinds of eternal creatures or gods or places, and after a while, I started forgetting who was who and why I should care. Most of the cutscenes could be summed up with ""listen to this deep-voiced guy say cool words."" If it wasn't that, it was ""watch this super muscular guy graphically slice up some enemies.""So if this what a Westernized version of Zelda looks like... I'll stick with the original, thanks.			"

												I felt like Darksiders did some things right but the main components of the game felt wrong. There are 2 aspects of the game which I think Vigil did right, and that is the sound (voice acting and music) and the art design. Both are well polished and interesting. War looks like a real badass and sounds like one too. But this game is a 'hack and slash' so the combat should be the main focus, and this is where I felt the game fell short. It felt clunky and slow to put it bluntly. Blocking is extremely awkwards because the put the same button to block as they did dash when you're moving in a direction. So when trying to block you more often than not dash, which can result in you getting hit. And I hate getting hit. Juggling also ties into blocking with how enemies behave. Small things like a certain grunt enemy (which are plentyful) do a ground bash that somehow also hits you in the air, which it honestly shouldn't (I mean, it is a ground attack), causing you to lose your juggle as well as being unblockable. The lock-on system and free aim systems are both awful. When locking on it changes your camera angle so you frequently can't see what is behind you and it is also awkward trying to change between targets. Free aiming is exponentially worse. It is difficult to describe in words, but the aiming is slow, clunky, awkward, and so frequently used it makes for a terrible gaming experience. What's more is that parts when you have to hit something with your projectile weapons is made that much harder because the game forces you to use the free aim controls, instead of just locking on to what you need to hit. I think this is unecessary to the overall experience of platforming. Manouvering the game world is also a chore in my opinion. Darksiders is a hack and slash, and world design in such games needs so be concise and straight forward, or in other words somewhat linear. Backtracking or having an open level design is fine, exemplified in Devil May Cry 4 for example. But Darksiders has a world designed more like and RPG than the traditional hack and slash and it is painful trying to navigate it. War moves rediculously slow, especially when you're just trying to move from A to B in a big, open space. Moving from area to area is more bearable with a quicktravel system, but that involves War walking from one portal to another in some ethereal space. It takes 2 minutes but it is rediculously tedious. There is absolutely no need for it. My verdict is that if you can pick up both Darksiders I and II for 10 bucks or less, you can do worse for your money. But small nuances in the gameplay degrade the overall experience too much, and I believe if you want a better hack and slash game you should play Devil May Cry 4 or earlier (not DMC).			"

												Pros: -Good graphics.-Interesting concept.  You brawl against both devils and angels.Cons:  -So many damn puzzles.  This guy shouldn't be the personification of War.  He should be the avatar of bored librarians with lots of free-time. You will be spending more time doing puzzles than fighting.  -Very poor console control to keyboard port. There is a part that requires you to hold a button to pick up an item while holding another button to aim. You do all this while trying to press more buttons to dodge the boss's attacks.-Uninspiring weapons and special moves.-Lots of backtracking across maps.  -Forgettable story line.I thought I was going to play as the bad-azz embodiment of War, but instead I felt like a cartoonish kid in green tights out to save my girlfriend.

												Hmm... Where to start. The beginning really caught me. It was impressive for the most part with the combat. However, when you're intoduced to Samael, that's where the bore-fest begins. Think of finding all of the map pieces in Wind Waker + a lot of enemies and areas. By that point, the story is dropped to focus on this one event. You could call it a contributing point to the whole story but once you get to the ending (which is where the story starts again), you'll soon see that it could of been organized better. If you like 14hrs of hack & slash + a few puzzles (don't overthink the puzzles like I did), then sure pick up the game.			"

												It breaks my heart to thumb down this because I love Joe Madureira and his work on Battle Chasers.To be blunt, from artistic stand point the game is flawless, but then again art is made by MAD! so it's expected.Combat is fast paced enough but what annoys me is they basically copy - pasted some moves/upgrades such as Nero's Devil Bringer (DMC4) or shameless Portal gun copy.However the big weakness in this game lies in the fact it super saturated with puzzles, and I don't mean Soul Reaver 2 kind of puzzles, but ""bring that potato over there"" or ""slightly move this thing to go to the other thing that you must move"", unlike Soul Reaver 2 however, there is no combat mixed between the puzzle pacing to break the mood, and the puzzles are repetitive at most  and lack of the rewarding feeling is sensed. It becomes really boring and I just know that new area == more boring puzzles... I really hate that, I recommend them do one play trough of the original DMC1.Joe, this was a nice try and I hope you succeed with the upcoming Battle Chasers game.			"

												Short and sweet: It's a good game! However --do not-- get this for PC if you can avoid it. It is TERRIBLY optimised and BARELY functions without the proper settings.Here's the only way I could get it to work for Windows 10 Professional: it WILL NOT function or run unless forced to run in windows 98 compatibility mode (Yes Windows 98! Not even XP or anything past could make it run).Here's the only way I could get it to minimize the BRUTAL stuttering issues down to moderate stuttering through the whole game after lots of research: Google ""Skyrim Stutter Fix"" and use the d3d9.dll and antilag.cfg to help lower the degree (but not get rid of) all the stuttering in the game.Deleting two of the start up films helps reduce load up times but --does not-- affect any of the booting issues in Windows 10 Professional.Also other known issues: DO NOT tab out of the game when it is running or it will often desync achievements with Steam if not outright crash. In order to make sure Steam achievements work then exit steam, re-open steam and open DarkSiders as the first fresh game on steam start up. Never tab out. Once done playing, fully exit steam and re-open before playign DarkSiders again.That's about all the major issues to cover if you just want to even try to play the game among possible other issues and crashing. Do yourself a favor and play this somewhere other than PC.			"

												I highly recommend NOT PURCHASING THIS GAME. If you want an RPG I highly reccomend you consider checking out Dark Messiah of Might and Magic instead.The game is terrible. You'll get the feeling that the designers wanted to do way more than they could handle or afford rather than adding core elements and refining it. Controls for KB/M are complete trash as it is more than blatantly obvious control scheme was never meant for anything other than a controller. Graphics are lackluster, Darksiders is 6 years old released in 2010 but looks and feels worse than some games with midrange budgets that were released pre 2006. I love RPGs and I didn't come into the game with high expectations so there was nothing to be let down on, it is just not enjoyable to play.  The sales + reviews made it out to be better than it is, honestly I'm not sure why the over reviews are ""Very positive"".3/10. Not even deserving of an A for effort.			"

												Had on my backlog for ever, why didn't I play this before. An ARPG that is mixed with a bit of Street fighter but unfortunatly that problemative first 3d one that didn't quite work.I started really liking this and there is a lot to like in the game, infact I did a review after 2.5 hours were I was very positive, since deleted. It has good environments, interesting story, bit of platforming and the combat starts well. The trouble is that the combat is a bit clunky at times, not always the easiest to aim/attack who you want. So when you get to the first real hard boss it is just plain out frustrating and so I walked away.Even some of the fights before that we not fun due to the clunky nature of 3d fighting done badly.Shame as really wanted to like this			"

												When this game game out, pc gamers finally got the third person, puzzle solving, hack and slash game we deserved all these years. dont let the possibly slow beginning push you away. give this game a good 30 minutes and you shant regret it!a very nice variety of weapon customization, brilliant puzzles that progressively increase in difficulty to ease you in on it, great battle combos, interesting voice acting and story telling, AND THE BEST ENDING IN A VIDEOGAME I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. the ending had me daydreaming for a sequel, and we got a very deserving one!textures seem a little outdated, but not nearly enough for me to complain about it, although some people might consider this a negative.when you finish this game, and finish the second one as well, your mind will be blown in how the story is told. the two games are linked in  such a special way, that just kills me inside, thinking of the fact that we might not see a third installment in the series			"

												Please note that I didn't dislike what I played of this game. This isn't a negative review based on gameplay, it's based on this particular copy of the game. When I downloaded this game I was excited to play it and at first didn't realize the major problem that was going on. I didn't have any cenimatics. Not one. No intro to the story, or the characters, or the setting. I was just thrown into a tutorial battle. I played through the tutorial twice, thinking I might have just missed something, and the second time through discovered that I didn't have a story. Just a bunch of fighting. I enjoyed the fighting, it was challenging enough for me to casually enjoy it. But I don't want to play the game without the story.			"

												I had quite a bit of fun with this game, but I can't really explain why.I couldn't keep my attention on the story, I can't even seem to recall what this game was about. The combat was fun, though there were times I got annoyed with it.The game seemed to over-stay in certain locations, but then the extreme change of surroundings when you go from place to place made that totally okay. The design of every area is truly fun to look at, I really enjoyed looking at all of the art, including the characters and the weapons.Even though I enjoyed the game, I'm not going to reccommend it. The second one changes too much, and makes the series more of a dissappointment rather than a fun memory. Also, the developers no longer will be making any more games past Darksiders 2, even though 4 is really the only amount of games that would complete the series, if not more.			"

												This had to have been one of the most repetitive games I've ever played. There's very little variation throughout the game which makes it extremely boring.The game is the same from start to finish. Everywhere you go and every step you take, enemies spawn. Kill said enemies and more spawn. Kill them too. Go to next area and guess what! More enemies spawn. Kill the newly spawned enemies after killing the other spawned enemies. Then kill more newly spawned enemies.Bored yet? That's Darksiders.			"

												This game confuses me. Actually... no. The game does not confuse me, but rather trying to write a review for it does. Why? Because it's extremely difficult to recommend on account of being one of the worst console ports i've ever seen. Some parts of the game are extremely difficult to do with keyboard and mouse, though not impossible. It's much better suited for a controller I'm assuming (I don't have one), and so if you have one you may be able to ignore what I just wrote here.And yet it's not entirely a bad game. Control issues aside, the game itself is competent, if somewhat unremarkable. The story is pretty forgettable, but the combat is pretty good. Especially so once you get the upgrades. However, it also has a really screwy difficulty curve: the game is at its hardest early on, with the first ""real"" boss (Tiamat) being the most brutal. Speaking of that bat-monster, I ran into a game-killing glitch right before fighting her that didn't open the door to her lair despite me having done everything necessary to make that happen. I had to go in and delete a file in the game folders to let me move on. The rest of the game was fairly smooth glitch-wise, but alot of the ""puzzles"" were more exercises in frustration more than anything else.Ultimately, i'd say get this on a console instead. It may be better there and more playable than this version. There's a decent game in here, but the PC port here screws it up. It's playable, but not good enough for me to recommend.			"

Can't remap keys to be comfortable, and some ""moves"" just seem impossible with a keyboad, but would seem to make sense with a controllerAnd as I don't have a controller and don't like them I'll have to downrate - should come with a warning like Dark Souls!

												Oiled by the tears of innovation, Darksiders delivers a truly fullfiling experience that will scratch every action-adventure itch you have. You'll have so much fun playing it, you won't have time to address the nagging guilt you feel.What guilt, you ask? Why, the guilt that comes from rooting on the bad guy! And in this case, the 'bad guys' are the developers of Darksiders. To suggest that Darksiders takes 'inspiration' from Prince of Persia, The Legend of Zelda and Devil May Cry is somewhat like suggesting that a spork takes 'inspiration' from a spoon and a fork. Darksiders unabashedly loots and presents ideas as their own, producing a product that could best be described as a Triple-A Fangame covered in abject plagiarism. And yet... it's really good. Like, super good. It's everything I wanted from a Frankensteinian monster. This must be what making a deal with the devil feels like.And it never felt so good.			"

												This game is not up to the level of quality required for a PC game.  It's a console port that leaves much to be desired.   The control scheme is very clunky.  The camera controls are almost non-existent.  Keyboard and Mouse control, which is ideal for almost any gaming circumstance, has been poorly applied to this game.If, however, you are craving a console gaming experience, but can't afford a lobotomy, Darksiders may be the crappy console port for you.

												I think the problem is this is designed for console and plays very badly on PC.  It seems that to use any of the advanced attacks you'd need 3 hands or some other inhuman anatomy to perform the vulcan death grip needed followed by concern pianist like coordination and reflexes to change keys.  Past that, it does a poor job of explaining things leaving you confused as to why you seemingly can't use an item you were given, or how you're actually equiping things.  And then you randomly pick up a barrel and can't drop it and while holding it can't open chests or use your sword until you find something to hit with the barrel so you drop it.  Again, I'm not a console gammer, don't have a gamepad, and that could be the whole of my issue here, I just found it unplayable pretty quick.  Also, 6 clicks to exit a game including one to start?  And then it has to run an uninstaller before you can actually delete it?  All around weird and clunky and doesn't want to die.			"

												In a nutshell?Poor controls optimization.Progression means puzzles, which are more like a bunch of chores.Really doesn't provide much of a difficulty challenge, unless you're trying to test your patience.On the plus side, Darksiders really does have a badass concept/plot. And I am really interested in seeing where the story leads. Just not at the cost of actually playing this game.Don't worry, I have solutions for you.Want to hack and slash some stuff?-Go play through the Devil May Cry games again.Want to solve puzzles creatively?-Go play some Sudoku with crayons.Want to enjoy a good story?-Go read a book.Genuinely curious about the story of Darksiders?-That's what Let's Plays are for.Want to slowly learn to hate yourself?-Spend your hard earned cash on this game. :) "

												Starting of with the positive about this game:-Good graphics for being this old.-The combat is quite fun.-Fun with that you can move around wherever you want even after you passed certain areas.And now with the negative regarding this game:-Random game crashes (Nothing wrong with my PC, can play all the games I have on ultimate graphic settings)-Sometimes it messes up the mouse sensitivity on my mouse, making it super slow and I have to unplug it and plug it in again to regain the normal one. Never had this kind of issue with any other games.-The achievements are broken, like ""Defeat [input boss name]"" doesn't register, aquire that certain weapon, doesn't register and such like that. I personally HATE when they put achievements in games that are broken, which mess up the fun if you're an achievement hunter.-Quite expensive (around 20 euros), wouldn't buy it unless it was 75% off deal.I quite enjoy the game, but thanks to the negative reasons I put up there, I can't recommend the game.

												I wanted to like Darksiders almost as hard as Darksiders kept trying to be God of War. I tried really, really hard.The concept is cool. Book of Revelation, four horsemen of the apocalypse, yaddayadda. Like any brawler the point is simple: smash dudes. Lots of dudes. Even if I don't much care for the Warhammer 40,000/World of Warcraft proportions and pauldrons fetish that Darksiders's art direction makes ample use of, the visuals are pretty good. The voice acting is fitting, given what script the VAs had to work with. And on that note, the characterization is about as shallow as either W40K or WoW's; angry guy is angry, thus, he does angry things. I didn't expect masterful writing going in, but when even mediocrity counts as a positive bullet point in a review, it heralds bad things to come.There's only one category where Darksiders really shines, and that's the boss fights. The introductory cutscenes are great, the battle mechanics themselves are usually pretty neat, you feel great for fighting and winning, you get to watch War perform some pretty brutal finishers on the bosses at the end, and there is no annoying underwater fight to speak of. A+.The final boss is the worst, though. No, not The Destroyer. The final final boss.The protagonist, War, and the final final boss, the camera, are introduced in the same cutscene sequence when you first fire up Darksiders and select New Game. And if you know anything about the camera angles in pre-rendered cutscenes, it's that you can't actually move them. Get used to a lot of that; Darksiders is an ongoing and constant battle of atrition against atrocious perspective shots, awkward lock-on phases, and jarring transitions.When clinging to platform edges and ledges embedded in walls that you can strafeclimb across, it can be difficult to see where you're going- especially if you need to leap to something behind you and you're in an enclosed area. The camera often can't be coerced to give you a view of where you're headed in such cramped quarters, so prepare to make many a leap of faith.At times, the target lockon feature avoids traditional third-person, over-the-shoulder camera angles in favor of side-facing perspectives that skew your controls by 90 degrees and throw your depth of field off, resulting in many swing-and-a-miss and failed dodge scenarios on your part.The lockon feature lets you cycle through enemies, but not consistently. On occasion, it will only toggle back and forth between the same two enemies instead of cycling over to whichever bigger threat you're trying to look at.During battle sequences the camera will often be hijacked to show the arrival of more enemies from somewhere near the area. When control is reluctantly returned to the player, you are often not facing exactly the same direction you were when the camera was stolen from you. You are not always finished fighting when this happens, either, which only exacerbates the problem.The awful teleportation mechanic introduced in the later part of the game wreaks havoc with the camera angle, snapping it to a fixed position and holding it there for just a second too long. Even if you look through your portals to preview where you're going, your perspective will be seized from you the moment you step through them, forcing you to react the way the game wants you to instead of the way you planned. Trial-and-error is not a fun mechanic.Sensitivity is not consistent between different game views. In the handful of shooter segments, your aim is off-the-walls oversensitive. In the brawler and platformer segments, the camera is much less sensitive. I found myself switching the game's camera sensitivity back and forth to try to compensate.Entire swaths of the puzzles in Darksiders feel unnecessary. There's a lot of time-based puzzle mechanics that involve a lot of waiting to reset if you make a mistake.Toss in an uncooperative camera that won't let you look up to see when it's safe to proceed until you're already hanging from the ceiling and the time-slowing Chronospheres to make you wait that much longer when the spinning fan blade you couldn't see coming knocks you down, and you've got a recipe for half an hour wasted on multiple, identical, really badly-designed obstacles in the Ashlands.Or, worse than player-controlled timers, there are entire rooms in the Dark Throne area in the later part of the game with floors that automatically build and remove themselves in cycles. If you miss the chance to step onto the path when it appears near you, you have to wait for the cycle to circle the entire room in order to continue. At least one of these also features a player timing puzzle.Darksiders features what most gaming circles call ""artificial difficulty."" The harder game modes bump up the damage enemies do and, possibly, the number of enemies and the number of waves of enemies you face, but they don't become more intelligent or actually more challenging to destroy; they just take longer to finish off. My first run was on Apocalyptic, the hardest difficulty setting. When I briefly tried again on Easy to see what the differences were for this review I noticed a stark difference in survivability- mine and the enemy's- but I didn't play long enough to really see if there were fewer enemies to fight. It felt that way but I can't confirm.My biggest complaint with the artificial difficulty is that it's irritating to be one-shot by some of the bigger baddies in the early game when you don't know how to fight them. Dark Souls players might find the challenge enjoyable, but the difficulty spike feels out of place in a brawler like this one. As I played, however, I picked up more Lifestones and was able to mitigate this problem. But it's still a problem.In the beginning of the game, when I was instructed how to toggle between running and walking, I was ecstatic. My joy quickly turned to despair when I realized that the player's default state is running. War's movement speed is agonizingly slow. This could be mitigated by Ruin, the demonic steed depicted in the game's promotional matierals, but Darksiders has a huge problem: you play one of the four horsemen, but you don't get many opportunities to ride his horse.It's unfortunate because everything in the game is either far too speedy or War is much too slow, though I suspect it's a combination of both. The result is a lot of chasing enemies around or trying to wade through piles of mooks to deal with the real threats and failing because everything can strafe circles around you. Thanks to a really jarring pause at the end, your dash is useless as a way to close real distance and seems to feature variable invincibility frames on top of it. I could never figure out what I did differently when I succeeded or failed; dodging always felt like a gamble.I experienced a handful of bugs while playing Darksiders, and if you look into my screenshot gallery for the game, you'll be able to see the few I had time to snag pictures of. In my playthrough of Darksiders, I......fell through the world, twice...got stuck in level geometry and couldn't escape, several times...got stuck in the Serpent Holes because the end portal didn't appear, once...got stuck in midair after being knocked out of an aerial combo attack, once...got pushed out of bounds underwater, ""died"", and respawned on land with less health, oncehttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=776105436http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=776098965I can't speak for the original PS3 and Xbox 360 releases, but this first PC port is garbage. Maybe the remastered version is playable, but this one isn't unless you're into sadomasochism. Skip it. I'm going to complete Darksiders, because I don't want to let it sit unfinished in my Steam library... but it isn't going to be fun.			"

												I really wish there was a ""Meh"" option instead of just thumbs up and thumbs down.   Oh well.  I don't recommend it mainly for it being just a clone of God of War that was rather mediocre.   It didn't do anything wrong, really, it just didn't do anything great either.   The dungeons were boring, the bosses were pointlessly repetetive, and the combat was just dull button mashing.  Heavily padded with filler content to stretch the play time.  The story was a ridiculous butchery of a mythos with every word of dialogue just mind numbing in how desperately it tried to be over-the-top-epic.  Chock full of generic tropes.   Ytf does the (useless) magic pistol have casings coming out of it?  I did like the way they were trying to go for a bit of a Zelda thing with it, but it was so linear, the idea just failed. The Watcher is an altogether pointless and stupid character who never once says anything that isn't annoying and obvious and should've been cut from the game altogether. ""Doesn't look like you can do anything against this [large gay spider], better avoid it""   ...Despite having just killed hordes of giant demons and three Demon Lords with little effort.  Riight.All in all, this game is hella mundane.  If you didn't play it when it was new, don't waste your time. Hopefully the sequel will prove more enjoyable.			"

												I found this to be a lame God of War clone. You wander around very linear areas, hacking & slashing, until reaching a point where you have to view a cinematic & do a quick time event. The story is stupid, too. If you’ve never played God of War you might like this game. If you have, though, there is no reason to play Darksiders because GoW is superior in every respect. Don’t waste your time with this one.			"

												Horribly repetitive, boring, bland game. The combat gets repetitive FAST. You can probably level the same complaint at most action/RPG games, but at least games like Titan Quest and Diablo give you enough loot, skill/talent upgrades and weapon upgrades to make it an intereseting journey. Darksiders does not. If you are a PC gamer, you are accustomed to better games than this. This is a PC port of a console game and it plays like it. The area graphics (anything that is not a character) are bland and boring (and look quite dated, really). Again, probably a product of it being made for consoles. Just skip it. There are better games out there.			"

												Let me say this before: I do not recommend this game at full price, when I took it was at -90% and only for that price I would take it again or suggest it to you... maybe.I will not tell you what's Darksiders about, there are tons of older reviews and web pages, I will simply tell you why I didn't fully appreciate my experience with this game (I quit it just before the last mission and complete it months later in a moment of boredom).-Many bugs that will never be fixed such as: achievements that randomly don't work, clipping or falling from the world (I'm sure that you will experience this last one when you will fight  The Stygian  I begin to consider to throw in the sponge after that fight).-The bosses are a joke.-Sometimes the cut-scene are just used over and over again and it's not possible to skip.-Combat is fluid but never evolves/changes.-Controls for keyboard/mouse are quite bad without any way to configure them, use a controller instead.-There is nothing new in the game about mechanics or style.Ofc the game has some good points too, I had a bit of fun when I wasn't mad because one of the previous points, the characters are nice and I liked the acting voice, the story was ok and let's not forget about the blood, demonic blood and angel blood :D.So take the game when it's on sale if you like the action/hack and slash games but do not expect too much.

												I don't understand why would anyone waste his time in this ""experimental"" game while there are really good hack and slash games!The game has good general gameplay & story concepts and mechanics, but overall it has way many flaws to deserve such high percentage of positive ratings as 95%, this is the game that will make me officially pay ZERO attention to Steam reviews in the future, it's very deceptive if you look at all these positive reviews and think it is a masterpiece but then realized it's a medicore game at its best.Let me lest a few of the negatives:1- Worst controls I have ever seen in a video game, like really; I didn't even know what are ""bad controls"" until I tried this game, I am still wondering how on earth those hundreds of developers didn't see that the controls are that bad and awkward to use while nearly 99% of the players and reviewers saw that?!!2- Camera angels are very bad and often get blocked by your character's back, and if you are aiming you can't move the camera freely because the developers think the enemy you are aiming for will stand there and wait for you to throw your weapon at without moving around!3- There is no dodge button which is very silly in a ""hack and slash"" game, what's there is a ""dash"" button which is useless in crowded combat scenes since your character pauses for a little bit if you use it, meaning that you will avoid the first hit but you will definitely get hit by another enemy because you can't ""re-dash"" again due to this 1 second pause period!4- You can't change the difficulty, so if you stuck due to high difficulty or just want more challenge if you find the game easy you can't.5- Puzzles are repetitive and have the same concept but in different areas, at least those that I have experienced so far.

												Best played with a gamepad because of the extremely heavy button mashing you do, this game is pretty decent. Darksiders 2 is WAY better though and you only have to mash buttons about half as much. So basically this recommendation is for Darksiders 2. It's a much better game anyway.

												Слешер перенасыщенный головоломками, которые не столько для ума, сколько для реакции. Раз 5 за игру испытывал откровенное утомление от игры, но перебарывал себя, так как хотелось допройти. Если бы я играл снова, то ставил бы игру на easy, чтобы не париться, потому что если хочешь бежать и рубить всех подряд, то тебе не нужны головоломки, а так как головоломок избежать нельзя, то слешер превращается скорее в что-то активное между головоломками. Вы заметили что текст перенасыщен головоломками? Это потому что они оголоволомили меня.Игра нарисована с уклоном в японскую сторону. Местами привлекательна, местами утомительна. Сюжет забавный, но много где крайне наивный, но тут не в наивности цимес. Могло получиться куда лучше, но то что получилось тоже может понравиться тем, кто, скажем, любит новых принцев персии и тематику битв ангелов и демонов. Странная игра. Оставила неоднозначное впечатление. Рекомендация: брать по 75% скидке со второй частью вкупе.			"

												This game was highly recommended and I simply did not think it was very interesting.After we've seen so many God of War style hack and slash games and arpgs, this just feels uncomfortable. The game itself is very cartoon-ish. Graphics are bright and cheerful, even in many of the darker areas. Battles feel dull since attacks have no real weight behind them. Collectibles are boring and more of a hassle to collect than necessary. Plot line feels uninspired and empty. PS1 style world with inaccessible areas that appear to be within reach.I would recommend Dante's Inferno before this game, and God of War next. Save your money for a more intense game or one with more replay value.			"

												I cannot give a full review as I did not play the whole game.But of what I have played let me list the things that brought me to see it in poor light:Writing isn't appealing - Corny, silly and ultimately not very interesting.Combat was bland - similar to a faster paced Zelda combat with Quick Time EventsPerformance Issues on PC - Some areas were oddly unstable, relative to the other parts of the game.Puzzles were not very satisfying - I just felt like I was going through motions rather than achieving anything or progressing.Maybe I am not the target market but ultimately I cannot recommend this particular game to people.

												Well, Made it into the tutorial. War can climb along ledges! Aparently not ANY of them in the section I could see. Spent another ten minutes jumping around trying to find what I was supposed to grab onto but whatever. It's clear that no matter how much my brother talked this game up, I'm immune to liking it by way of... whatever.EDIT: Update on my original review. I noticed a running problem with Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, Sleeping Dogs and Binary Domain so I did some investigating. The problem stems from the Razer Tartarus. With it unplugged, the game works just fine. I can't review the game yet seeing as I just started getting it working but the issue IS NOT with the game per se... I mean, It's still the games fault that for some reason it detects my Tartarus as an Xinput controller, therefore an Xbox 360 controller but still. If you're having issues, make sure you don't have ANY other controllers plugged in than the one you want to use.[Original Review] Launches fine. Menu shows only 360 Controller Prompts, 360 Controller doesn't work for no reason at all. Unplug 360 Controller and Xbox prompts stay on screen. Restart. Still only has 360 prompts. Mouse and Keyboard controls don't work at all. Controller doesn't work at all.Can't play the game at all. Well, I can load the first level, hit ESC and hit Quit but that's all I can do.♥♥♥♥♥♥ Console Port. [/original review]			"

												I have started it several times, and I've always failed it at the same place. I know how to beat Tiamat -- I just can't execute it. Best result being that I was able to down her, but beating her for what felit like half an hour did cause the occasional error on my part so she did occasionally hit me and eventually killed me even on that session.I would love to like that game. I actually DO, but I can't recommend a game that I can't beat due to awkward controls or overpowered bosses. "

												So I've finally gotten around to playing Darksiders this week.  It's been called Ocarina of Time mashed up with God of War.  I've never played God of War, but it certainly feels a LOT like Ocarina.  It's fun, to be sure, but it's inferior in a couple of ways.  The most glaring is that it's SUPER linear. At least the first 5 hours I've played has been. Whereas most Zelda games resemble an open world (even though the sequence of events is linear).  Darksiders very much funnels you from arena to puzzle to arena and is far easier than Ocarina.Less obvious is where the theme, plot, and characters fall far short of Zelda.  You'd think that playing as one of the Horsemen of the apocalypse, War, and battling demons, being a general badass would be freaking amazing.  It's really not.  Because of the overly grandiose nature of your character and the plot, you really can't connect with any of it on any level, and it feels like you're just going through the motions to get the game done, and it really doesn't effect you in any IRL capacity.Contrast that with Ocarina, wherein you are a mysterious little boy given the gift of this task of saving your loved ones from a mysterious malevolence starting with nothing at all and finally becoming a young adult with a kick butt arsenal and mad skillz.  A little more dynamic, emotionally, than, ""Hey, you're War, you start out powerful and get more powerful.  Have fun killin' stuff.""Overall the game is fun, and worth playing so long as you don't expect it to be different from anything else you may have already played.  A solid hack'n'slash with a great aesthetic.			"

												This is possibly the worst port ever of a console game to the PC. Its impossible to finish without a controller, you can get up to the ashworms, and that's it and no further. The moment you get on a horse the controls screw up so badly that its impossible to continue, the moment you try to move in any direction while riding your horse the character WILL jump off and you WILL get killed. Also aiming doesn't work for squat because they assume you're moving around with a joystick.			"

												Let me put this game into perspective for you.It is the End War. The armies of Heaven and Hell have both broken loose and seek to destroy all before them.YOUR job is to grind the nations of the Earth into dust and usher in the Apocalypse.And that's just the tutorial.DARKSIDERS II: Deathinitive EditionTHE FOLLOWING IS A PRE-PLAYED REVIEW OF DARKSIDERS II: DEATHINITIVE EDITION. I HAVE NOT SUNK A SINGLE MINUTE OF PLAYTIME INTO THIS VERSION OF THE GAMESo I've been reading the reviews for Darksiders II: Deathinitive Edition. I still hate the term Deathinitive. Let me go on the record saying that right now.Anyways, reviews are mixed for DSII:DE, and this may turn people away from actually considering getting it, because Mixed Reviews means that the game is at about 60/40 or 50/50 on good/bad reviews. But there is a very valid reason as to why this is.It is because the PC Gaming community which I happen to be part of is a bunch of self entitled little ♥♥♥♥♥. We have people whining that, because they bought DSII, but not all the DLC, they should get DSII:DE (which features a graphical upgrade AND every single DLC released for it), they should be getting the game for free, , because they are just getting a ""graphical polish that should have been there in the first place"" (in their eyes), as opposed to getting it at 80% off (about 6 bucks American). Let me be clear. These guys are whining because they have to pay SIX BUCKS. PS4 and Xbox One users have to pay full price for the game. These guys get 80% off of a game on release day. RELEASE DAY! How often do you hear about a game being 80% off for ANYONE on release day?Besides. Don't blame Nordic Games for this. Blame Steam for making it impossible for Nordic to reward their fans the way they wanted to anyway. They intended to give a free copy of the Deathinitive Edition to anyone who had bought Darksiders II plus the DLCs, but Steam forced their hand to have it be those who had bought the Darksiders Franchise Pack (Darksiders, Darksiders II, the soundtrack for both, a Darksiders Prequel Comic, and all the DLC for Darksiders 2 wrapped up into a single-purchase package). My previous post already went over the various Loyalty Tiers available, even having a tier for ""New members of the Darksiders Franchise"", read, people who haven't paid a single red cent for their games.So yes. A full two-thirds of the negative reviews are just entitled brats whining about having to pay 6 dollars for a game that costs 30. ♥♥♥♥ them.The rest of the reviews complaining about 1.) how buggy the game is, or 2.) being unable to purchase Darksiders II now. As in, the regular version, NOT the Deathinitive Edition. The second category of negative reviews can be safely discarded.Bugs in a game, especially on launch day, should be expected. Some of the bugs listed are in fact quite valid. Example: Some of the reviewers bought/unlocked/played the game on the first day. They all had the same issue. The game would get to the main menu, they would start a new game, and they would Crash to Desktop. And they wrote an angry review saying ""don't buy his broken game, ♥♥♥♥ nordic games for ♥♥♥♥ing with the game""And that is a very valid review for a very valid problem. If you can't play the game, any price above free is too high to pay. Thankfully, after the bombed port that was Batman: Arkham Knight, Steam has a refund option, an option these people took. But that wasn't the end.See, those that stuck around beyond the First Day Crash bug found out something. Nordic was listening. and Nordic started fixing the various bugs players pointed out. Starting with the Crash Bug, which was fixed on day 2, which is why it is referred to as the First Day Crash Bug, because it was only experienced by people who bought the game and played it on the first day. Since then, over the past 15 days, Nordic has been responding to any bug reports they get, and dealing with them accordingly. Did you have a Season Pass to Darksiders II? Email them proof, and you will get a Steam Key to the Deathinitive Edition. Just activate it and boom, done. The game is yours now. Many of the issues the negative reviewers are complaining about (excepting the ones whining about paying 6 bucks for a thirty dollar game) HAVE BEEN DEALT WITH.REPEAT FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK. NORDIC GAMES IS ACTIVELY WORKING ON FIXING ANY AND ALL ISSUES THAT GAMERS FIND WITH THEIR DEATHINITIVE EDITION OF DARKSIDERS II.THEY ARE NOT BEING WB GAMES AND LEAVING IT A MESS LIKE WB DID WITH ARKHAM KNIGHT. THEY ARE CLEANING IT UP AND MAKING SURE IT WORKS, TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE CAN ENJOY THEIR GAME. AND I CAN SAFELY SAY IT IS THEIR GAME, BECAUSE NORDIC GAMES HAS IN FACT RECRUITED THE OLD DARKSIDERS CREW FROM VIGIL GAMES (Hopefully to work on Darksiders III)One final thing to note. Apparently, according to one reviewer, a lot of people were complaining about how DSII:DE wasn't running at full 60 fps on max settings even though they had super souped up rigs. This perplexed this user because he had a modern rig, and was experiencing the same things. He found a fix for this. And it apparently is that you just need to rollback your hardware to an earlier version, and it will run like a dream (Applicable to NVidia users, cannot speak for AMD). Don't ask me how that works, I don't have a ♥♥♥♥ing clue. Also the System Requirements section on DSII:DE is now slightly archaic and innacurate.So the vast majority of the negative reviews on DSII:DE can be broken into three types of people~~People whining for paying 6 dollars for a AAA game (even though this AAA game is at about a third of the cost of a Standard AAA Game. CoD sells for about, what, sixty bucks on release? and its ♥♥♥♥ing CoD!!!)~~People griping about bugs, but didn't stick around for them to be fixed~~People who found the game running less than absolutely perfectly on frames per second, and blamed the game company, instead of their hardwareSO. WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING THROUGH THE REVIEWS OF DARKSIDERS 2, DISREGARD THOSE TYPES OF NEGATIVE REVIEWS ENTIRELY, BECAUSE THEY ARE ♥♥♥♥♥ING AND WHINING, NOT BECAUSE THE GAME IS BAD, BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE ENTITLED LITTLE ♥♥♥♥♥.Instead, do what I do when looking at buying a game. Read the reviews, yes. It's how you find out if a F2P multiplayer game is F2P/P2W (Free to play, pay to Win). Those types of games need to be weeded out and destroyed. But as for everything else, read reviews, but watch some gameplay footage on Youtube. You'll get some spoilers, sure. But you will also get a look at the style of the game. The controls, unfortunately, you won't know unless you play it. Some people like the control scheme for Brutal Legend, some people don't. That's a case by case basis that the reviews can't particularly grasp.As far as my review for Darksiders II goes, here it is.Zelda-esque puzzles, God of War's hack and slash combat, Brutal Legend's fantastical art design, and some of inFAMOUS's platforming style all get together and have a big, massive orgy pile in Diablo II's dropped loot mechanic, and Darksiders II was the baby. If you liked a majority of these things, then you will enjoy Darksiders II, I can almost assure you.So final verdict: ""Is it good?"" I hear you ask, to which I say ""Yes!""""Is it for Everyone out there?"" I hear you continue, to which I respond cheekily ""Is ♥♥♥♥ing anything?""If you liked Darksiders and have been considering getting Darksiders II, go ahead. If you liked Darksiders II, you'll not be getting much new, and it will be more of the same, but CoD, HALO, and Assassin's Creed gamers are getting more of the same with each subsequent release yet they don't seem to mind paying full price for it			"

												Love this game. The combat is fun and challenging and the story is awesome. Who doesn't want to play as one of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse? The puzzles you have to do in order to get to the bosses are challenging and need a good amount of thought to figure out. However, the bosses are kinda lackluster. Their designs are great, but they are soooooo easy. The only one that was challenging was the first one, Tiamat. Even the Destroyer was too easy. I literally stood in front of him till he took 5 lives out of my eight and beat him with 2 lives left. I was playing on normal, but from what i hear, it's basically the same story on Apocalyptic. Besides the bosses being easy, its a great game, totally recommend it. 10/10 would fall in a chasm 8947 times again			"

												I bought the Franchise Pack and It was worth it. Give it a thumbs up for the challenge. Hardest game series in my 23 game fav list. To do the puzzles I neede video walkthrough and Assassin Creed 2 like mechanics which for me I do not enjoy accept for the challenge for my stubborn Irish attitude pushes me to fight thru it and keep trying. Only game where I had to watch Video Walkthrough and is the only way that I finnshed the game.  I will play it again and a couple more times. I am spoiled with my 5 star games series Mass Affect, Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Dragon Age Origins, Bio Shock which I compare all others to. Only the game mechanics for me puts this at 4 out of 5 star. I will be happy to play it again. I am playing DarkSiders 2 now and have a review for it also figured and play both in row. Do not let the challenge scare you away when there are video walkthroughs to help. I swallowed my pride and am happy for it.			"

												Simple Amazing.I Played Darksiders II first, then after loving it so much(see my review) i got this one from my GF =P.First things first. This game is equally amazing as DSII. Of course the second game has better systems, physics and graphics. The ""tools"" that WAR uses are similar to Death tools. So puzzles are all the same, tricky and fun.Weapon system is fixed, more to a Devil May Cry style you stack souls and upgrade gear. WIth little more than 6-8 combos to each of the 3 weapons you dont have a14987870987 combo list to keep track making combat simple and fun.Killing scenes...finishing moves. well. Amazing, breathtaking.Music 10....man, darksiders OST, I and II are overpowered.Plot : 10....i mean, buy those 2, play and pray for the DS III soon(TBA since the original studio is dead....but Crytek did bought the rights, Joe Madureira, the mind behind darksiders is a crytek employee ....so lets pray to see the end of this EPIC tale.

												Join War, the first Horseman of the Apocalypse, in his search for vengeance through an epic story about heaven and hell, and angels and demons. Darksiders brings a story never told before in gaming, and along with its Legend of Zelda and Gears of War type gameplay, it is a game to enjoy from start to finish.This game has some of the most epic boss fights I've seen, well thought 3D puzzles and an upgrade system that, back in the day, was cutting edge. Hack and slash your way to the most powerful upgrades and bring vengeance and redemption to War in this amazing story.This game has everything I like, and for that, it deserves an overwhelming 5/5. If you have it and didn't play it, install it right now and have fun. You can thank me later.			"

												Obligatory header to the review: I focus on four primary areas whenever I review a game: gameplay, story, graphics, and sound/audio/general things that go into your earholes. Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.Gameplay: For all intents and purposes, I should absolutely love this game. Many people make the comparison between this and Legend of Zelda, and I am certainly in that camp. Why I say that I should absolutely love this game is because my biggest beef with the 3D Zelda games has been the combat. It's not bad, but it certainly could be a lot better. This game does have better combat than the 3D Zelda games. So why don't I like it as much as I should? Here's a few reasons why.One of the reasons why I'm not too keen on this game is the combat itself. Yes, it is much better than the Zelda games, but it's just too clean. I'm not talking about violence or anything; there's plenty of that. Rather, the combat just feels really light and floaty; there's no weight to it. Admittedly, games like Dark Souls may have spoiled me on weighty combat, but Darksiders just feels sterile to me; you don't feel like you're there hacking up enemies. Mechanically, the combat is very sound, but it just lacks the feel I think a hack-and-slash game should have. Boss fights are a bit of a mixed bunch; no bosses are terrible, but some of them are just kinda meh.In fact, ""meh"" kinda gets to the point of why I don't like this game as much as I probably should. The whole journey just feels like a ""been there, done that"" sort of adventure. It's not the easiest thing to describe in words, but this game just feels soulless to me. There are some inspired bits here and there, but they only account for about 20% of the game's running time. The biggest mark against this game has to be the dungeon where you get what is basically the Portal Gun. I can't help but feel that the game design meeting for this section went along the lines of, ""Hey, you know what's popular? Portal. Let's do a Portal section."" Again, there are a few clever uses of the Portal gadget, but it just reeks of the designers giving up.Despite these three paragraphs of negativity toward the game, I can recommend it if you're looking for a Zelda-like game that has better combat than Zelda. Just don't go into it with too high of standards. I would use the phrase ""Diamonds in the rough"" to describe the good bits in this game, but I feel that's a bit too harsh of a comparison. Rather, I think ""Garnets in the Styrofoam Peanut Pile"" is a good comparison. There's good sections and bosses in there. You just gotta wade through a lot of mediocre stuff to get to them. 6/10.Story: The story is actually mildly inspired by the Biblical story of the Apocalypse and the coming of the Horsemen. By this I mean that there is some other original stuff added to it so that it's not a complete carbon copy, much like a lot of the game is anyways. However, this game just tries way too hard in my opinion to be cool. Also, ""Creator"" and ""Destroyer""? What's so bad about God/Jehovah/YHWH/whatever you wanna call him vs. Lucifer? I get that hiding the identity of the ""Destroyer"" is actually relevant to the plot, but the story is clearly inspired by the story in Revelations (New Testament stuff, so no crossover with Judaism), so why not just call the character God? I'm making petty complaints, though. It's alright, but the writer really needed to lay off with the angst, especially with some of War's dialogue. 6/10.Graphics: The art style isn't actually half bad in this game. I dug some of the enemy designs, even if they were repeated quite a bit with ""color palette switcheroo""-esque changes. Plus, many of the areas have a very ""big"" feeling to them, a feeling that I love seeing in areas in video games. Some people say that War's character design could've been a lot better, and while I agree, I don't think it's that abysmal. After all, Square Enix has had MUCH worse character designs than War. Now, on the technical side of things, there unfortunately isn't very much in the way of graphical fidelity control. There's no option for Anti-Aliasing or Anisotropic Filtering, which is quite disappointing for a game released in 2010. There's also no option for windowed mode, so if you're a person who likes playing game in windowed mode, you're kinda stuck. Fortunately, the game does run at 1080p, which it does run fairly well and fairly cool on my GTX 760 with all the settings that I could max out maxed out. However, I again suspect that the reason why it does run cool is because they never implemented the high-end features. 3/5.Music: The game does come with the OST, but like many orchestral soundtracks, none of the songs really left an impression on me. It's not like Dark Souls (and this is the last comparison I'll make to Dark Souls for this review; I swear) where each track is anthemic to some area. It basically comes down to a multipurpose battle theme and a multipurpose boss theme. The final bosses' theme wasn't bad, but I'd be hard pressed to remember it if you played it back to me without telling me what it was from. The voiceacting, much like the story, is very try-hard to be cool. You can hear the angst dripping off of War's lines, and it's actually kinda funny listening to the game try to be hard. Again, this may be because the VAs didn't have much to really work with, but the voiceacting is forgettable at best and absolute ham at worst. 2/5.Overall score of 6/6/3/2; 5.7/10. To refrain what I said in the intro, a 5 isn't awful in my perspective; it's just average, and that's what this game feels like to me: average. Your mileage may vary; in fact, one of my friends thought this game was worthy of a five star rating. To me, though, it's just a slightly above average hack and slash game. I wish I could give a neutral, but since my score errs on the side of a thumbs up, I guess I'll give it a very low-held thumbs up.			"

												Legend of Zelda meets the Apocalypse. I absolutely loved Darksiders, moreso than Darksiders II. The hack n' slash was enjoyable, and while some bosses were pretty easy to beat, a couple required a fair bit of ingenuity and tenacity. The plot is absolutely amazing, and the enemies are well-designed, artistically speaking. The game does play on a few old tropes, but as an older game, I find it pretty alright. There is a little bit of grind if you decide to fully upgrade your weaponry or purchase everything, but it isn't necessary at all to enjoy the game. On Windows 7, there is also a pretty bad issue with the game randomly deciding to quit, but there are ways around that. I believe I had to launch the game offline from steam when I was running Windows 7. I've had no problems so far with 8.With the franchise looking bright once again, I'd recommend giving the game a shot!			"

												I originally bought and played this game on console, back when it first came out (2010), and bought this one with the ""Darksiders Franchise Pack"" that was for $14.99 in May (2014).  The game mechanics are pretty decent, although, jumping can feel awkward at times (especially when you get the Wings).  Where this game really excels, is in the overall story, dialogue, and music.  I can't wait to see if any other games in the series come out (Darksiders II feels the same as this one, but I haven't played much of it...yet).			"

												I cannot recommend this enough. Although the first couple of hours are a bit boring and repetitive, this game turns in to one of the finest Zelda rip offs I have ever played. If you've played through a recent Zelda and enjoyed it, Darksiders offers the same gameplay but with a different aesthetic. It trades the cartoony for an extreme 90s comic book visual. You even get Navi in the form of a grim spectre voiced by Mark Hamil.			"

												A game that’s not afraid to be a game. If you’re looking for something inventive its not the best place to be, however the plot is coherent and arcade like slashing oddly hypnotising. Not without its flaws but entertaining, with some memorable boss fight moments, which are few and far between in the modern arena.			"

												Amazing, amazing game.  Played a few years ago on the Xbox 360 and didn't really appreciate fully what an amazing game this is.  Action, adventure, excitement.  Big freaking swords...  It has what most 30 something year old males appreciate.  Scratch that.  This is a game that every man who has ever spent at least a minute dreaming about angels, demons and kicking♥♥♥♥♥should experience.  Why?  Well, did I mention it has big swords? (see, something for women too!)As for other reasons, well, it has a wealth of interactivity, amazing (and I mean AMAZING) environments and a whole host of ungodly (and very godly!) creatures to talk to, stalk and annoy.  Want a better sword?  Talk to the dodgy demon in the park, want some currency?  Go get a few souls by killing zombies in the park.  Want a better game?  Try playing this one first before you play Darksiders 2.Haha, but no seriously, I fully intend to molest this game before I move onto the sequel, because hey, when you're onto a good thing, keep playing it.  The only downside is that like most games, there will be frustrating moments in it occasionally, be it the odd insta-death from a hard enemy or just a puzzle, but it keeps the game fresh and constantly interesting.  Also, love it of hate it, aspects of old platform games do pop up now and then and the older gamers may recognise (and chortle at) some of the random occasional nods to other forms of entertainment here and there, but from my personal experience with the game, it never detracts from the gameplay or screams in your face like some of the newer titles around.Overall, recommend.

												I originally purchased Darksiders because I watched a good portion of a let's play series on it and it seemed like a lot of fun! I had heard negative comments here and there about the quality of the port from consoles, but I figured it couldn't be too bad, right? Well, I'll get to that...First and foremost, let's talk about the story...It's great! Really awesome premise and it's implemented very well.  Basically, you play the part of one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, War. In this game, the Horsemen exist to maintain the balance between Earth, Heaven, and Hell. Anyone who goes against this balance is quickly and brutally punished. War wakes from a long slumber by a summons to Earth because the balance has been broken. As it turns out, he (you) has been summoned prematurely, and gets in trouble for being the cause of this supposed imbalance. This starts a rather convoluted, yet very compelling, string of events in which War tries to reprove his innocence by finding the one who, essentially, framed him. Try not to stress about spoilers or anything...this is all made clear in the tutorial portion of the game :PThe other thing I'd like to point out is a personal fixation of mine - the soundtrack. As I've said before, the music in a game can be a huge factor in how well it plays, and Darksiders is no different. The music is actually very good! It's definitely a score that I would (and currently do) keep in my music collection! The downside here is that it can get very repetitive during long hours of gameplay. The whole soundtrack is outstanding, but there isn't enough diversity within the actual game to break up the monotony of listening to the same track over and over again while traversing a large distance. This actually brings me to my next point...The game is, more or less, and open world. There are only certain areas you can explore to begin with, but once you unlock an area, you can almost always return there at-will. The exceptions to this being anything related to the storyline - say if♥♥♥♥♥♥goes downhill at a place you already visited and it progresses the story to travel back there. While this by itself is a good thing, the sheer size of the world is a little off-putting. The game seems to falsely enhance its own play time by making you hold the ""W"" key for 5-10 minutes at a time in order to reach your destination. On top of that, there are enough random encounters to make you rip your own hair out. Setting the difficulty easier doesn't help this, either. It just makes these encounters more of a nuisance than anything else. If you have the difficulty up, then expect to die repeatedly to these unending hordes or demons while trying to get to the store.If the combat in the game was well-implemented, then all these encounters wouldn't be so bad. Unfortunately, Darksiders is no God of War. The combat style is very God of War-esque, but it, like much of the game, is also monotonous. Technically, it is very dynamic, but it's dynamic for all the wrong reasons.  There are a finite number of moves/combos that War can perform, but the odds of you even finishing a combo are pretty slim. There is a dodge mechanic that NEEDS to be used frequently if you fancy staying alive. Each combo is between 3 and 5 moves, but the fighting in practice is HIT-HIT-DODGE-HIT-HIT-DODGE-HIT-HIT-KILLING BLOW-DODGE-DODGE. There are also a very small number of finishing moves that can be performed on enemies. In the beginning, it looks like each kind of demon has a special killing blow made just for it, and that realization is terribly exciting! The excitement dies about 3 or 4 hours in, though, when you notice that the same 5 or 6 killing moves are reused for some enemies.It's right around this time that you also notice the enemies that share killing blows also share a lot of the same characteristics as well. They're not just similar...they're the SAME! Quite literally, Darksiders will use the same attack patterns, behaviors, etc. for three or even four different enemies...the only thing that changes between them are the actual models. And, even then, it's hard to see them differently when they're jumping all over your face just like the little bugs in the tutorial. WAIT! That guy jumps more frequently than the previous iteration did!>.>Lastly, the controls were obviously meant for consoles. That much becomes obvious early on in the game. Granted, the keys are all fully rebindable. But, in no computer game ever should you have to hold a button and press another in order to access an ability. Yes, you can rebind the button you need to hold, but you still need to hold the damn thing down. With mobility being almost key in this game, you pretty much have to bite the bullet and take a hit or two if you want to perform a special ability or even down a health potion. In the game's defense, you could probably spend the time and rebind all the keys such that you play only with the keyboard, but even that would present a challenge when trying to move and do just about anything else simultaneously.So, this concludes my rant about Darksiders. It is a game that I REALLY wanted to like...truly, I did! Sadly, it's hard to like something when there are such glaring problems. To be honest, I would say this game is still worth playing for the story. That is, if it was even playable on the computer. If you have an Xbox-style gamepad (cause good luck using a Playstation one), and you can bear the long hours and monotonous play. then go for it! If not, I'd recommend Youtube-ing this one. There are a number of full playthroughs that will give you the full story experience without having to deal with bad controls....the ability to skip through long journeys is a plus, too. - Mr. Talidar			"

												A fast pace beat em up action game - worth every penny spent .Positives:+ Similar to hack-and-slash games of the genre - Ninja Gaiden/Onimusha/Devil May Cry - and has the same feel+ Interesting combos and weapons to keep you engaged in combat.+ Decent GraphicsNegatives(If any):- Can become bothersome to travel around after awhile.- Hints of some copying of characters from other games? (player looks like Arthas from Warcraft?)- Is better on a controller than on mouse and keyboard - controls aren't bad on the keyboard and mouse - but if it feels better on the controller (Razer Onza for me) - players without one may not fully enjoy it.

												Have you played a hack n' slash before? Then you've played Darksiders. Sure it has special stuff to make it more... unique, I guess, but it still feels like the same thing I've played before.This game could have been cool, it could have been what the second managed to accomplish but it wasn't. There is literally nothing that this game offers that the second one doesn't surpass. Let me give a brief discription of what you'll encounter in this game:The main character is a whiney, pseudo-badass who has more armor than he does personality. He hates angels, apparently because they're mean to him and nothing else. I'm not surprised, I'd be mean to someone who was that big of a poser, too. The swordplay sucks. There are a very limited amount of moves you can successfully do - unlike the sequel which offers so much more in terms of combat that it's unfair to compare the two. If anything, this almost feels like a beta for that game.Enemies are boring as boring can be. Demons and angels are the only enemies and most are merely copy+pasted from the beginning of the game towards the end. I know what you're thinking, ""but aren't all games like that?"" No, most games offer something inbetween, even if its temporary. It gives the player a breather from the same old stuff they've already seen. This just pushes out the same enemies, aside from bosses, the whole entire game.The soundtrack reminds me of an orchestrated mess. Probably because that's exactly what it is. THERE ARE NO OPTIONS TO CHANGE THE VIDEO SETTINGS. YOU ARE STUCK WITH WHAT THEY PORTED OVER.Fun? This game delievers bits and pieces of it, but it's more a ""McDonald's"" experience for the most part.Skip this game, read an abriged version of the story (trust me, there's nothing there) or watch a ""let's play"". But whatever you do, do not spend your money on this game.Graphics 2/10Playability 7/10Gameplay 5/10Soundtrack 4/10Replayability 1/10Overall Score 4/10			"

Sure, you've got Zelda-inspired dungeons and exploration, but you also have a combat system similar to God of War and other action games. You can also level up weapons to unlock new skills and combos. I know what you're thinking. All of this has been done before, right? But not all of it has been put together into one amazing game. The designers managed to pull tons of styles together into one game and execute it flawlessly. Not to mention, the story is badass. Oh, and War's version of Navi? A floating spirit voiced by Mark Hamill. In his Joker voice. Seriously, this game kicks♥♥♥♥♥ Go play it now.			"

												Darksiders is an extremely fun spectacle fighter with a great art style and setting, alongside an interesting story and fantastic soundtrack. The game offers action, platforming, and puzzle gameplay with a mixture of spectacle fighting, zelda-esque drip feeds of tools and hidden goodies, and the occasional platforming section. The boss battles are rather easy once you find their weaknesses but all the bosses are varied and make for an enjoyable fight. In keeping with the Zelda/Metroid mechanic there's lots of interesting equipment to unlock, meaning you can return to areas you've previously visited and find passages/rooms which you couldn't access before, which is always fun. Most of the puzzles are quite simple up until the very end where they start to get a bit tricky. Darksiders is a great mixture of a spectacle fighter and an RPG with good mechanics, great combat, and a fun and interesting storyline!9/10			"

												Darksiders is a game that uses many elements from games like Zelda Ocarina Of Time and Devil May Cry the gameplay might be a exact copy of Zelda but who cares Darksiders is a more mature zelda if you played games like God Of War or Devil May Cry its a mix of the two the animations of Devil May Cry and the combat controls from God Of War this a game about the apocalypse of mankind where you play as a badass named War who is one of four horsemen of the apocalypse the story is very interesting the combat is perfect the music is magical this game is perfect i have zero issues however the pc port is not a good one a shame for such a wonderful title to have a bad pc port there is no anti aliasing or anisotropic filtering the not only that but the game has a issue with the achievements on steam this may or may not be a huge issue overall Darksiders is the best game i've played the gen Darksiders is the perfect blend of Zelda like puzzles and the combat is like DmC without being impossible to pull off a single move Darksiders is a perfect game 10/10 the pc port 5/10			"

												Wonderfull story and excellent combat.  But the puzzles and the sheer number of them are annoying as hell.  I think a good 80% of my play time was taken up by dealing with puzzles.The puzzles are annoying because virtually all of them broke my immersion in the game.  I never looked at one and thought, ""hmmm....  how am I going to deal with this situation.""  My reaction was generally along the lines of ""♥♥♥♥♥♥ another tedious puzzle I have to solve because the damn devs decided that there HAD to be one right here.""Best way to describe it was that the puzzles never really felt organic to the game, they all felt forced.So be warned, if you can't stand doing puzzles for the sake of doing puzzles, you probably should skip this game.

												Darksiders is an extremely fun spectacle fighter with a great art style and setting, alongside an interesting story and fantastic soundtrack. The game offers action, platforming, and puzzle gameplay with a mixture of spectacle fighting, zelda-esque drip feeds of tools and hidden goodies, and the occasional platforming section. The boss battles are rather easy once you find their weaknesses but all the bosses are varied and make for an enjoyable fight. In keeping with the Zelda/Metroid mechanic there's lots of interesting equipment to unlock, meaning you can return to areas you've previously visited and find passages/rooms which you couldn't access before, which is always fun. Most of the puzzles are quite simple up until the very end where they start to get a bit tricky. Darksiders is a great mixture of a spectacle fighter and an RPG with good mechanics, great combat, and a fun and interesting storyline!9/10			"

(player looks like Arthas from Warcraft?)- Is better on a controller than on mouse and keyboard - controls aren't bad on the keyboard and mouse - but if it feels better on the controller (Razer Onza for me) - players without one may not fully enjoy it.

												I originally purchased Darksiders because I watched a good portion of a let's play series on it and it seemed like a lot of fun! I had heard negative comments here and there about the quality of the port from consoles, but I figured it couldn't be too bad, right? Well, I'll get to that...First and foremost, let's talk about the story...It's great! Really awesome premise and it's implemented very well.  Basically, you play the part of one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, War. In this game, the Horsemen exist to maintain the balance between Earth, Heaven, and Hell. Anyone who goes against this balance is quickly and brutally punished. War wakes from a long slumber by a summons to Earth because the balance has been broken. As it turns out, he (you) has been summoned prematurely, and gets in trouble for being the cause of this supposed imbalance. This starts a rather convoluted, yet very compelling, string of events in which War tries to reprove his innocence by finding the one who, essentially, framed him. Try not to stress about spoilers or anything...this is all made clear in the tutorial portion of the game :PThe other thing I'd like to point out is a personal fixation of mine - the soundtrack. As I've said before, the music in a game can be a huge factor in how well it plays, and Darksiders is no different. The music is actually very good! It's definitely a score that I would (and currently do) keep in my music collection! The downside here is that it can get very repetitive during long hours of gameplay. The whole soundtrack is outstanding, but there isn't enough diversity within the actual game to break up the monotony of listening to the same track over and over again while traversing a large distance. This actually brings me to my next point...The game is, more or less, and open world. There are only certain areas you can explore to begin with, but once you unlock an area, you can almost always return there at-will. The exceptions to this being anything related to the storyline - say if♥♥♥♥♥♥goes downhill at a place you already visited and it progresses the story to travel back there. While this by itself is a good thing, the sheer size of the world is a little off-putting. The game seems to falsely enhance its own play time by making you hold the ""W"" key for 5-10 minutes at a time in order to reach your destination. On top of that, there are enough random encounters to make you rip your own hair out. Setting the difficulty easier doesn't help this, either. It just makes these encounters more of a nuisance than anything else. If you have the difficulty up, then expect to die repeatedly to these unending hordes or demons while trying to get to the store.If the combat in the game was well-implemented, then all these encounters wouldn't be so bad. Unfortunately, Darksiders is no God of War. The combat style is very God of War-esque, but it, like much of the game, is also monotonous. Technically, it is very dynamic, but it's dynamic for all the wrong reasons.  There are a finite number of moves/combos that War can perform, but the odds of you even finishing a combo are pretty slim. There is a dodge mechanic that NEEDS to be used frequently if you fancy staying alive. Each combo is between 3 and 5 moves, but the fighting in practice is HIT-HIT-DODGE-HIT-HIT-DODGE-HIT-HIT-KILLING BLOW-DODGE-DODGE. There are also a very small number of finishing moves that can be performed on enemies. In the beginning, it looks like each kind of demon has a special killing blow made just for it, and that realization is terribly exciting! The excitement dies about 3 or 4 hours in, though, when you notice that the same 5 or 6 killing moves are reused for some enemies.It's right around this time that you also notice the enemies that share killing blows also share a lot of the same characteristics as well. They're not just similar...they're the SAME! Quite literally, Darksiders will use the same attack patterns, behaviors, etc. for three or even four different enemies...the only thing that changes between them are the actual models. And, even then, it's hard to see them differently when they're jumping all over your face just like the little bugs in the tutorial. WAIT! That guy jumps more frequently than the previous iteration did!>.>Lastly, the controls were obviously meant for consoles. That much becomes obvious early on in the game. Granted, the keys are all fully rebindable. But, in no computer game ever should you have to hold a button and press another in order to access an ability. Yes, you can rebind the button you need to hold, but you still need to hold the damn thing down. With mobility being almost key in this game, you pretty much have to bite the bullet and take a hit or two if you want to perform a special ability or even down a health potion. In the game's defense, you could probably spend the time and rebind all the keys such that you play only with the keyboard, but even that would present a challenge when trying to move and do just about anything else simultaneously.So, this concludes my rant about Darksiders. It is a game that I REALLY wanted to like...truly, I did! Sadly, it's hard to like something when there are such glaring problems. To be honest, I would say this game is still worth playing for the story. That is, if it was even playable on the computer. If you have an Xbox-style gamepad (cause good luck using a Playstation one), and you can bear the long hours and monotonous play. then go for it! If not, I'd recommend Youtube-ing this one. There are a number of full playthroughs that will give you the full story experience without having to deal with bad controls....the ability to skip through long journeys is a plus, too. - Mr. Talidar			"

												Have you played a hack n' slash before? Then you've played Darksiders. Sure it has special stuff to make it more... unique, I guess, but it still feels like the same thing I've played before.This game could have been cool, it could have been what the second managed to accomplish but it wasn't. There is literally nothing that this game offers that the second one doesn't surpass. Let me give a brief discription of what you'll encounter in this game:The main character is a whiney, pseudo-badass who has more armor than he does personality. He hates angels, apparently because they're mean to him and nothing else. I'm not surprised, I'd be mean to someone who was that big of a poser, too. The swordplay sucks. There are a very limited amount of moves you can successfully do - unlike the sequel which offers so much more in terms of combat that it's unfair to compare the two. If anything, this almost feels like a beta for that game.Enemies are boring as boring can be. Demons and angels are the only enemies and most are merely copy+pasted from the beginning of the game towards the end. I know what you're thinking, ""but aren't all games like that?"" No, most games offer something inbetween, even if its temporary. It gives the player a breather from the same old stuff they've already seen. This just pushes out the same enemies, aside from bosses, the whole entire game.The soundtrack reminds me of an orchestrated mess. Probably because that's exactly what it is. THERE ARE NO OPTIONS TO CHANGE THE VIDEO SETTINGS. YOU ARE STUCK WITH WHAT THEY PORTED OVER.Fun? This game delievers bits and pieces of it, but it's more a ""McDonald's"" experience for the most part.Skip this game, read an abriged version of the story (trust me, there's nothing there) or watch a ""let's play"". But whatever you do, do not spend your money on this game.Graphics 2/10Playability 7/10Gameplay 5/10Soundtrack 4/10Replayability 1/10Overall Score 4/10			"

												Amazing, amazing game.  Played a few years ago on the Xbox 360 and didn't really appreciate fully what an amazing game this is.  Action, adventure, excitement.  Big freaking swords...  It has what most 30 something year old males appreciate.  Scratch that.  This is a game that every man who has ever spent at least a minute dreaming about angels, demons and kicking♥♥♥♥♥should experience.  Why?  Well, did I mention it has big swords? (see, something for women too!)As for other reasons, well, it has a wealth of interactivity, amazing (and I mean AMAZING) environments and a whole host of ungodly (and very godly!) creatures to talk to, stalk and annoy.  Want a better sword?  Talk to the dodgy demon in the park, want some currency?  Go get a few souls by killing zombies in the park.  Want a better game?  Try playing this one first before you play Darksiders 2.Haha, but no seriously, I fully intend to molest this game before I move onto the sequel, because hey, when you're onto a good thing, keep playing it.  The only downside is that like most games, there will be frustrating moments in it occasionally, be it the odd insta-death from a hard enemy or just a puzzle, but it keeps the game fresh and constantly interesting.  Also, love it of hate it, aspects of old platform games do pop up now and then and the older gamers may recognise (and chortle at) some of the random occasional nods to other forms of entertainment here and there, but from my personal experience with the game, it never detracts from the gameplay or screams in your face like some of the newer titles around.Overall, recommend.

												Very good game. This one is much more linear than the second one (for the obvious reason it was the predecessor), but the play style between the two stays relatively similar. If you like ""Zelda-like"" games or ""gauntlet"" games where you slaughter countless foes with wicked combos you will enjoy this one. Even though this game was ported it is pretty stable and runs well on PC. If you enjoy apocalyptic storylines you'll enjoy the Darksiders series games.			"

												Decent story, good visuals.  Controls are pretty good.  Combat gets a bit repeatitive and kinda feels like you are mashing the same button over and over but it's still fun for some mindless beat em up action.  The puzzles are the best part, progressing through the world with new abilities and items is very metroidvania like and becomes really fun when you have to problem solve to clear areas, find secrets and beat the boss fights.  Definitely enjoyed the playthrough but after beating it not sure I would return to it.			"

												Oh... My character looks badass... Oh, his sword is badass... Oh, these monsters here are badass... Angels there are badass... This place is badass... This NPC is badass... This finish move is badass... This music is badass... This boss is badass and kicked mine already.Well, it is not very intuitive to play with a keyboard (as things like, keep one button pressed to lock target then press another button to open a menu and quickly select via a third button the power you gonna use...).And the colors are a little too bright imo for an apocalypse, full with demons and blood and stuff.Yet, once you met War, you'll find out that Link is a lil' ""Bieber"" travelling across gentle worlds. Not so revolutionnary but well done with great feelings of power against epic monsters. We really feel that devs took fun to create finish moves and monsters and it is very pleasant to feel that fun-sweat when you already enjoy yourself.If you're BADASS, you alrdeay own this game !!

												Ok, this is a hack and slash/platform/puzzle game. It doesn't try to be everything to everyone, and it's not a clone of any other game.What I love most about this game is the art direction. I absolutely LOVE the imagery in this game! I keep coming back to it every six months or so to play through it again and am still astounded by the small details in every environment. Skulls on the walls, some with fire in their eyes, designs on the floors and ceilings, the enemies are just amazing looking, and it's just challenging enough to keep you interested. My only real gripe is the camera in this game, but I have a problem with that in every hack and slash type game. I have been in awe of the design of this game since I first picked it up; too bad it was completely lost in the sequel, which I haven't finished because it's just too boring. I mean, what other game do you get to ride a horse with flaming hooves?? Sure this game shares some mechanics with God of War, and the original Devil May Cry's, but I don't see the problem... because those games were phenomenal. Underappreciated? Yeah, this game was very, very underappreciated.			"

												It's The Legend of Zelda, but darker and grittier. If you thought changing into a wolf was intense, try a flame engulfed demon. The story is tight and the mythos is interesting. You get a variety of weapons and items to choose from, each with their unique purpose and advantages in battle. The developers threw in a bit of RPG elements with a leveling system for skills which didn't add too much to be honest.The game is a little short and some of it is predictable as far as action games go. It definitely doesn't have the depth that other action games (Elder Scrolls, Witchers, and even LoZs) but still, for those who are a fan of action games like LoZ, this game is worth playing.I would recommend playing the game with a controller as it seems like a much more precise experience. The game has some camera issues which the controller alleviates by giving you more control over the camera angles.			"

												When given the call the 4 horse men come and fix the problems caused by the three relms.. Heaven, Hell and Earth.You play the role of War who seems to have been called and after laying waste to the first lot of deamons and angels he finds on earth he is pulled up infont of the council who explain... there was no call?! by the time this has been looked at 'Destroyer' has taken control over the third relm.. Earth.To end your sentence in pegatory you must go and defeat Destroyer!The gameplay is like Zelda, if Zelda lived in a Led Zepplin cover. There are switches to switch, gaps to jump, puzzles to solve and waves and waves of bad guys to slay.This is less tedious than you think and makes you feel as powerfull as War really should!Would recommend to a friend.

												Satisfying action/puzzler that manages to land somewhere between Legend of Zelda and God of War. I felt kinda like I was playing a Zelda or Metroid (or Castlevania) game but in a gorier, darker setting.The puzzles and fights are generally challenging but not excessively so. The plot is fairly well-written and satisfying, but can sometimes be a little confusing, and the exposition is unevenly distributed. The RPG elements are satisfying, but don't allow very much customization.The graphics are getting a little dated, but still fairly pretty. The game itself is slightly unstable; it crashed 3-4 times total on my playthrough. The interface works pretty well for the most part, but I would recommend using a controller, and there are a few poor design decisions -- e.g. the ""continue"" option always loads the most recent auto-save, even if there's a more recent manual save.

(This and Darksiders 2.)  I thought it was going to be a directed hackenslash like God of War, or DMC (Which I typically don't care for)... and it kind of was... kind of.  Though it had elements of that genre I found it more to be a more badass version of the later LOZ Games.  Then I noticed the entire game seemed to pay homage to some of the games I admire most by including subtle elements from those games in here.  I played it on apocalyptic mode, which I would highly recommend.  It makes fights feel like accomplishments.  The story was fun and made me look forward to the next one.			"

Best proof of that is that I actually took the time to go for all the achievements.The game actually made me buy Batman Arkham Asylum.

												 A third person hack and slash game with puzzle elements ( even a portal gun! ) allows the player to be War, one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse.  War travels to earth where the forces of good and evil are waging in battle caused by a minion from hell called the Destroyer.  When War shows up both sides are confused as to why he's there because the horsemen can only be called when the seventh seal is broken...which is wasnt. A story of revenge and choas follows.  With upgradable weapons and a semi big list of different moves allows you to be all powerful against the minions of heaven and hell sent to stop you on your quest.  Secret chests scattered through every level containing health, wrath ( which allows you to do special moves ) and armor upgrades give the game a certain degree of replay after some items like the grapple are unlocked.  If you like chaining combos, button mashing, searching for secrets, and enjoy killing big bosses then try this out. Oh yeah and you can ride a horse.			"

												Spiritually is similar to God of War - it's a fun puzzle, adventure, fighting game. Worth playing through at least once. The story plays on Christian instead of Greek/Roman themes where you play as one of the four horseman of the apocalapyse, who strive to preserve a balance between Heaven and Hell. Think Constantine. I'm a sucker for these types of games and while this one certainly has some of the tropes of the genre (too much unnecessary button mashing for example, although much of this is removed in 2) I still had a fun time. Puzzles can take some time to figure out which is nice for a change.			"

My only real gripe is the camera in this game, but I have a problem with that in every hack and slash type game. I have been in awe of the design of this game since I first picked it up; too bad it was completely lost in the sequel, which I haven't finished because it's just too boring. I mean, what other game do you get to ride a horse with flaming hooves?? Sure this game shares some mechanics with God of War, and the original Devil May Cry's, but I don't see the problem... because those games were phenomenal. Underappreciated? Yeah, this game was very, very underappreciated.			"

												This half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥PC port of Darksiders comes with no adjustable graphics settings except resolution, and I had to find a third-party game to stop the mouse cursor popping up in the centre of the screen every 20 seconds. In addition, some achievements failed to register, a common problem according to the forums.The game itself is a combination of God of War and Zelda, but sadly very far from being as good as either of them. The poorly thought out, illogical storyline, fanfic-grade script and entirely uncompelling characters manage to make even war between heaven and hell boring. The character models are fairly uninspired for the most part, although the environments are generally better, particularly in the first half of the game.To begin with the game is rescued by decent action gameplay, some well-designed dungeons and fun bosses. There's not a single shred of originality to be seen anywhere, but it works well enough that it's decent fun all the same. Unfortunately the last quarter of the game does its best to ruin all that, with the final dungeon stealing shamelessly from Portal - yes, you are given a portal gun for no apparent reason - and still managing to be a tedious slog with pointlessly long elevators, the same rooms and corridors repeated, and a boss that's far easier than any that have come before. Then you are given a fetch quest to go all over the map to pad out the game a little more before a final boss bereft of any real challenge or tension and a pathetic little sequel-bait ending.Don't bother.

												 A third person hack and slash game with puzzle elements ( even a portal gun! ) allows the player to be War, one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse.  War travels to earth where the forces of good and evil are waging in battle caused by a minion from hell called the Destroyer.  When War shows up both sides are confused as to why he's there because the horsemen can only be called when the seventh seal is broken...which is wasnt. A story of revenge and choas follows.  With upgradable weapons and a semi big list of different moves allows you to be all powerful against the minions of heaven and hell sent to stop you on your quest.  Secret chests scattered through every level containing health, wrath ( which allows you to do special moves ) and armor upgrades give the game a certain degree of replay after some items like the grapple are unlocked.  If you like chaining combos, button mashing, searching for secrets, and enjoy killing big bosses then try this out. Oh yeah and you can ride a horse.			"

												Now I played this game quite a while back so some of my experience is lost with time. That being said I have nothing but good memories of this game.Pros: Challenging bosses, who are huge in scale and destructive power, fairly large open ended world where there is a semblance of discovery, a interesting story line, gameplay was smooth and satisfying. Cons: Sometimes the boss's can be very challenging and dont give you very obvious finisher intel, which can be kind of frustrating after going through the motions of weakening them to that point over and over. If you don't have at least a medium spec'd pc this game is basically unplayable. You need to shoot for their recommended as a minimum to avoid lagging and stuttering which is not good in a game like this. Overall: 8.5/10 because it gave me a solid 30 hours of gameplay because I am a noob for the most part and took my time. Most others will finish this game in 20+, which if you ask me is still very acceptable since I got this on sale for like 10$ or something.			"

												An apocalypse happens but it's some Umgah-style practical joke as 7th seal wasn't broken and you, horseman War, joined the fray to punish the wicked slightly too soon, bosses strip you of powers, and you need to do some cleaning. Picking up yer old (or new) powers and toys as you go.3rd person view action adventure game.. In fighting part, it reminds me of Devil May Cry (3/4), but DMC is clearly superior there. Better story/characters and various combos that actually feel like they matter, unlike in Darksiders.Difficulty curve is bit weird, mooks way too easy, minibosses and bosses - you just have to figure out what to do, while elite mooks will give you most trouble at first. Then as your strength goes up, it's all sorta easy even on apocalyptic.But, surprise surprise, puzzling part is huge in Darksiders, you actually spend more time messing around, exploring, on scavenger hunts, rather than fighting. And I did enjoy this part very much even if it's sorta borrowing ideas around.			"

												Vigil Games' first installment in the Darksiders franchise. You play as War, a horseman of the apocalypse. Gameplay is technically like Zelda: You travel, fight and find items in order to progress throughout the story. While some will look at the gameplay and shout ""God of War,"" the game's highest point is not about the combat; it is about the exploration and the experience of traveling in a post apocalyptic earth while meeting some characters with great acting (Especially Mark Hamill).  One of the highest appeals in my opinion is the art style that is used, very reminiscing to old 90's comic books. A normal playthrough will be about 8-9 hours at best. Collecting every item and powerup will include about 6 more (Achievements are even longer). I recommend getting it in a sale or right this instant if you don't mind paying the $20 fee. Overall a great enjoyment that Zelda and Action RPG fans will enjoy.			"

												I like to call this game Zelda for adults.  The developers basically carbon copied the structure of Zelda games, added third person hack-and-slash combat (similar to God of War I'd say) and wrapped it around the world of the Darksiders comics.  It has a pretty familiar dungeon system with locked doors and backtracking when you get the higher level gadgets (also mostly carbon copied from Zelda.)The environment is quite bland, the voice acting is mediocre, and the game has one of the worst opening sequences I've ever seen in a game; but if you give it a chance it does turn into quite a good game.  Combat is very fun and there's a lot of unlockable combos and abilities you can use to add variety.  The bosses are well-designed and fun to fight and the game rewards skill quite well.Now the PC version has a few issues and is quite a lazy port.  The game has a serious lack of video options (though it doesn't really need any honestly.)  It also uses fixed-rate mouse polling which causes the mouse speed to increase when your framerate drops which can be quite annoying.  There's also a bug which completely breaks the aimed throwing function if you change the control for throw.  But despite these problems, it still works better on PC than Darksiders 2 where they actually did try (belatedly, but they tried.)Definitely a fun game for those who would like a more adult-oriented Zelda game and for those who just like third-person hack and slash action.

												I just finished it, start to finish. I did not collect all of the abyssal armor pieces.About the game,:-Its like a very brutal legend of zelda. you go through dungeons, find weapons in said dungeons and killthe boss with them. But much more brutal-gameplay is not very complicated  mostly like god of war.-The story is very good in my opinion and leads on to the nest game.-Overall 7/10-Has more originality than the square enix games.

												Love this game. The combat is fun and challenging and the story is awesome. Who doesn't want to play as one of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse? The puzzles you have to do in order to get to the bosses are challenging and need a good amount of thought to figure out. However, the bosses are kinda lackluster. Their designs are great, but they are soooooo easy. The only one that was challenging was the first one, Tiamat. Even the Destroyer was too easy. I literally stood in front of him till he took 5 lives out of my eight and beat him with 2 lives left. I was playing on normal, but from what i hear, it's basically the same story on Apocalyptic. Besides the bosses being easy, its a great game, totally recommend it. 10/10 would fall in a chasm 8947 times again			"

												This is a surprisingly good metroidvania style game that more people need to give a chance to.It has loads of gameplay content and variety, some great level and puzzle design, amazing cartoony visuals that succeeds at  making the over the top post-apocalyptic/fantasy setting both bleak and colourful, top notch voice acting and character design (except War, which just looks silly).Yes, it steals loads of ideas from other games, but the end result is larger than the sum of its parts and a truly fun experience.

												How to sum up this game... part Zelda, part Devil May Cry, part God of War.The first part is Zelda because the game focuses greatly on puzzles at times. Unfortunately, the puzzles can often come off as exhausting and tedious. They're alright.The Devil May Cry part deals a lot with the Chaos Form that you get to beat the crap out of baddies with and the sword play, which is also reminicient of God of War. Probably more so God of War, but the way you can just press the B button (360 controller) to wreck enemies is just too similar to Devil May Cry 4.The game has a decent amount of collectables, but they're nothing special and might not keep you compelled to collect them all because of how bloody difficult some of them can be to find without simply looking up a guide.Lastly, this game kind of suffers from the perpetuated idea that the end of the world has mainly dull colors. Pretty much all dull colors. It doesn't keep the environments terribly fascinating and kind of wears you down after a while. The story isn't the greatest either. It's got the classic ""Angels are in this game, so they have to be enemies."" Seiously, how many games are there where angels aren't your enemies? I digress.This game has some fun combat and good puzzles, but it also has tedious combat and tedious puzzles. It's not the worst action/adventure I've ever played by a long shot, but it's definitely not the best. 7/10. Worth checking out if it's on a Humble Bundle or if it's on significant sale.			"

												Great modern classic, i had never paid attention to darksiders before because im not the biggest fan of Madureira's artstyle, i mean, its cool, its quite barroque, but i dont know its not really what i prefer, but i decided to give it a try mainly because i found out that the game has a ""metroidvania"" feeling to it, and even though it's not a huge game nor a very complex one, it is indeed VERY solid and entertaining, the story is not bad either and Mad's style kinda grows on you, Darksiders borrows from classic action rpgs but also adds flamboyant combat techniques from more modern games, and personally i love revisiting all areas with the help of new tools and capabilities to discover secrets and optional upgrades once you are near the end, its a nice break from the story and the ""duty"" to do some freeroaming with the reward of getting stronger for the next boss. In few words this game is perfect, im not saying its the perfect action rpg/metroidvania/platformer or whatever u want to call it, im saying that it is in its own right perfect, the combat is fun, the puzzles are fun, and it has a great rythm.

												The story is amazingly well done. The gameplay is in your face fun. The button mashing can get a little repetitive but can be fun if you know how to do alot of the moves. The frustrating thing that was a huge upset for me was that the Steam achievements wouldn't unlock when they should. You had to restart steam and start the game right away for the achievements to work properly. Aside from that maddening bug in the game the cinematic's in game were full of detail and really fun to watch. All the enemies in the game had their own way of attacking and style as to how they approached you. The game concentrates on the ""fun factor"" of playing. I have really enjoyed this game and I know you will too if you like an adventure game that will make you want to come back later for more.			"

												Wow, I mean WOW! This game blew my mind! I know there is a lot of copyright issues with it since it's sort of like a God of War/Zelda/Portal Game. But I must say that I have to give this game a 9/10. The only reason it doesn't get a 10 is for it's originality, but that is also it's greatest strength because it captures other game elements that we love and puts it in here. Also, the boss/difficulty curve is difficult at the beggining and then gets, as ZeroPunctuation puts it ♥♥♥♥♥♥easy'. Just to be clear, there is a lot of cannon fodder in this game and you will get bored if you don't get prepared for it. I recommend a God of War game before hand to get a better picture of what your in for. Overall, good game, good characters, and even some funny humor that made me ROFL. If you get a chance to buy this game on sale, I would highly recomend it. It was a good $10 spent for 20 hours of my life. I cannot wait for the sequal with the other riders.			"

												Darksiders is a third person action game developed by no other than sir Joe Madureira, the famous comic artist that is best known for his work with Marvel comics, and his Vigil Games studios. Despite the game being a clone of a lot of stuff, from the main character that looks just like Arthas from the Warcraft franchise, to the game mechanics that are a mixture of God of War, Devil May Cry and the like, and a lot of little things like Portal's portal gun, the great amount of work that the developers put into delivering a cinematic, engaging and varied gaming experience ultimately pays off and results in an unexpected amount of hours of fun. There really is a lot to do aside from slashing down demons(and angels) as one of the Horsemen that have the task of establishing an order between the dark and the celestial forces in Darksiders, especially solving the (rather simple but very frequent)puzzles that each section is filled with, to exploring the areas to find hidden enhancements and crates. Even the slashing down part doesnt let itself get too boring, with quite a few choices for the development of the character's abilities and moves for each weapon, the toughness of some battles and the old-style boss encounters. The puzzles, anyway, at times get just tiring and are never really challenging if you're coming from the 90s or are have at least a bunch of synapses to tie up your neurons, and the backtracking for the last hidden enhancements can get frustrating, but overall, as someone that never had too much fun with Devil May Cry, Darksiders is a very pleasant surprise even if, like me, action games are not really your cup of tea. Especially for the ridiculous price that it costs nowadays.			"

												Darksiders is a game that uses many elements from games like Zelda Ocarina Of Time and Devil May Cry the gameplay might be a exact copy of Zelda but who cares Darksiders is a more mature zelda if you played games like God Of War or Devil May Cry its a mix of the two the animations of Devil May Cry and the combat controls from God Of War this a game about the apocalypse of mankind where you play as a badass named War who is one of four horsemen of the apocalypse the story is very interesting the combat is perfect the music is magical this game is perfect i have zero issues however the pc port is not a good one a shame for such a wonderful title to have a bad pc port there is no anti aliasing or anisotropic filtering the not only that but the game has a issue with the achievements on steam this may or may not be a huge issue overall Darksiders is the best game i've played the gen Darksiders is the perfect blend of Zelda like puzzles and the combat is like DmC without being impossible to pull off a single move Darksiders is a perfect game 10/10 the pc port 5/10			"

												Overall great game. Seems a little too difficult at times, but I've pulled through. I like how it's not just ""run through and kill everyone"" like other games. The techniques you learn are actually usefull. There are puzzles thrown in, some more difficult than others. Bit of a cliffhangar to make you want to play the second game. I was very pleased. Couldn't stop playing it.			"

												This game is pretty good. Main problem I find with it is that the Wrath powers are ungodly difficult to use if you don't use a controller. If that controller is anything but a Microsoft 360 controller than it won't work without some weird emulator thing. This is kind stupid and annoying since the game appears on the PS3. Why does it only work with Microsoft brand controllers? That is just insulting and really annoying Steam so (even though I love) you guys are ***holes for this fact. Though oddly I still recommend this game.			"

												Great source of mythology taken from the viewpoint of the Horseman of War. Gameplay can get pretty intense due to fighting multiple enemies at once. But, if you learn to combine a fluid motion of combos, and keep moving, you can deliver a massive ammount of damage to many enemies in a short ammount of time. Great game.			"

												God of War + Zelda + slower combat. While Darksiders is a fairly solid game, it adds nothing new to the genre -- most items are variants of quintessential Zelda items, and those that aren't have their mechanics taken from other games. The story takes a while to unfold -- the first 4 dungeons (roughly half the game) might as well be filler, honestly. But once the story gets going it really takes off. Don't let my negativity fool you, though. Overall, Darksiders is a fun game to play. Aside from achievements randomly not unlocking, which you can find plenty of complaints about online, the combat is decent and the storyline is good.			"

												Take Zelda.  Make the story more focused and voice acted, but make the world less open.  Keep the focus on puzzle based environments but increase the depth and amount of combat.  Now, take Zelda's Hyrule and replace it with a post-apocalyptic earth ruled by demons and you've got Darksiders.  It's a lot of fun and the RPGish leveling up and enchanting of your weapons gives it an added dimension.  The story, while not the best out there was still entertaining and kept moving at a pretty good pace through the campaign.  The giant boss fights were a real treat and very well made.  They all have certain puzzle elements reminicient of Shadow of the Colossus (though not nearly to that scale) that made them very stisfying to beat.  All in all a very fun game and well worth the play through.			"

												A Fantastic underrated gem. Darksiders features War, one of the riders of the apocalypse as the main hero venturing through a forsaken earth littered with demons standing between him and his reprieve for his sins. It combines platformer, melee/swordplay hack and slash with some RPG elements, think Legend of Zelda, God of War and Devil May Cry. (But simpler combos), It features a grim yet refreshing and somewhat cartoony setting. (gorgeous art style) There are constant upgrades and new abilities to add to your repertoire.Darksiders hits the nail right on the head. Well worth the current price tag.			"

												Think of Legend of Zelda but instead of Link being an elf he is one of the four horsemen, and instead of saving a princess you kill your way to the top of finding out who framed you for starting the apocalypse. Also you have a sword called the ""Chaos Eater"" which as described in the name, has the ability to consume chaos in amounts ranging from small, to ""quite large actually.""			"

												Story: 6/10Interesting new take on something that's been done before. While the eding is epic, a lot of the game seems like going from fetch-quest to fetch-quest. The character of War and is summed up as ""Angry Guy with a Big Sword and Horse"", and while the game adknowledges this fact, there is a distinct lack of humanity in the characters, even for demons and angels. The game hopes to be a stepping stone for a larger scale game, and it does build to that.Atmosphere: 4/10The zones are intersting and have a very alien feel to them, however you quickly forget that you are on Earth after leaving the first few zones. There is a lot they could have done with the setting to show a post apocolyptic world without getting stale, however the fantasy aspect seems to take over a bit too much. The areas are pretty, and seem vast, however are often rather small and get old fast.Gameplay: 5/10Basic puzzle-dungeon gameplay with hack and slash combat. It doesn't seek to expand into any new territory, but accomplished what it wants to. The hack and slash style combat is straightforward, giving you combos and allowing you to level new ones. The finishers get annoying after seeing them more than once, and some abilites are insanely powerful.Sound: 6/10War's voice acting could be described as "" Christian Bale Batman with some cough drops"". While not the worst, all the voice acting in the game is....alright. Up to industry standards, but definately not pushing any boundaries. The music, however, is great though and fits well with the fantasy/war style the game wants to express. Pros:Gameplay is something that ....worksStory is a new take on something we've seenSoundtrack is greatCons:Lacks the Human aesthetic the first level hasPoor CharacterizationBuy If: You like puzzle-dungeonsYou are intersted in the Four Horsemen storyYou want to play Darksiders 2			"

												As an achievement hunter I'm really really sad that the majority of my achievements never registered. It's a known issue, but that really doesn't excuse it.. Anyway, Darksiders has a few flaws but honestly it's actually more than solid enough to recommend it. The story's quite good, the characters are interesting and the gameplay is satisfying - both the puzzling and the battle system. That said, Darksiders doesn't do achievers justice. A person like me wants to experience all the game's got to offer and get recognised for it. But if you just follow the story you will run into everything by default. Sure, there are a few things that require going out of your way to obtain, like the Abyssal Armor or the Legendary add-ons, but by then you've accomplished everything and the only thing that remains is the final boss and the credit screen. Because of that, getting that fat loot doesn't feel nearly as rewarding as it should have. The game looks like it could offer so much more to people who drive themselves to explore every part of its world, but it just doesn't. I wonder if Darksiders 2 will make up for that? I'm itching to find out.			"

Sure, you've got Zelda-inspired dungeons and exploration, but you also have a combat system similar to God of War and other action games. You can also level up weapons to unlock new skills and combos. I know what you're thinking. All of this has been done before, right? But not all of it has been put together into one amazing game. The designers managed to pull tons of styles together into one game and execute it flawlessly. Not to mention, the story is badass. Oh, and War's version of Navi? A floating spirit voiced by Mark Hamill. In his Joker voice. Seriously, this game kicks♥♥♥♥♥ Go play it now.			"
