												 I purchased this game as part of the Saints Row Ultimate Franchise Pack, which was on sale at the time for about $18.  I can honestly say this game has left me completely satisfied with my purchase, and despite having bought the bundle at the beginning of the summer, and played every day, it was at least a month before I even opened Saints Row 3 for the first time, because I was having so much fun playing Saints Row 2, and there is simply that much to do.  With 233.8 hours on record as of my review, I still am only at about 95-97% completion on my first and only playthrough, because it was simply too much fun screwing around.  Even after finishing the story missions, of which there are more than enough to make the game worth buying all by itself, there was still so much to do.  The controls took a bit of getting used to, but only at first.  After a short while, any oddities control-wise felt completely natural, which is far from always the case when talking about ported titles.  The only thing I could recommend a controller for would be the driving/piloting.  While driving ground vehicles, the WASD keys don't quite give you the best experience, but they work perfectly fine for it.  The main complaint I had about the game in general were the flight controls, which were awkward at first, but even after getting used to the layout, which wasn't that strange, it still lacked the ability to make small adjustments without losing control, unless you practice a lot. (I practiced a lot though, and mostly was able to work around it.) I got so accustomed to the keybindings in this game that I actually changed most of my SR3 keybindings to match (where they were different at least) because I found I honestly missed many of the default keybindings where they had been changed.  Still, using a console controller for the air vehicles is probably your best option, if nothing else.  The graphics are far from amazing by current standards, but considering the time the game was made, they're perfectly solid, and the water still looks more real than watch dogs (you actually have a wake in a boat! HOW ADVANCED!! Sorry had to. considering I got this game in a huge bundle for only 18 dollars, I am not only satisfied, I would gladly have paid $18 dollars for this game alone, if I evaluated the value of the game solely on the amount of fun I had playing it.  All in all, I fully recommend this game and hope others enjoy it as much as I have.			"

												The best Saints Row game made to this day.. The others are bigger and crazier but this one is the real deal. It has the most alive city. There are lots of different individuals. People, constructions, cars and general theme changes from district the district. So you never get the feeling of hanging around same place over and over again. Story is what it should be in an open world game. Three enemy gangs and you want to end them all. Simple. But the way they present it with missions is really impressive. There are lots of touching moments as well as action packed ones. In some mission I felt so angry that I find myself finishing all of the gangs mission in one play.In my opinion GTA was always very linear. This one has three set of missions that you can do in whatever order you want. And if you are bored from doing it you have tons of funny activities. Customization options are huge. For cars, gang and yourself. There are some crazy and useless ones but you could nearly create and ideal character for your taste. So any cons? Yeah of course. Driving is kinda hard. Cars don't respond right most of the time and you feel driving a paper car or something. Graphics are out of date of course (which is not a problem for me because I have and old computer). Finishing activities can be so much hard sometimes, 6 level a bit hard, 3 is ideal I think. There are some bugs in some missions and graphics but they are not a big deal. And there are some problems with the default controls but I'm sure you can make it work. You get used to after a while.In conclusion this game still has it. It has all the right touches. Yes it is an old game but still one of the best open world game I have played. I give it at least an 8 out 10. It is not expensive. So you should try it...PS: You know what makes this game better, steam achievements.. And trading cards... Ohh I wish...PS-2: I didn't play any other version of the game so I couldn't compare them. But this one worked just nice for my PC.			"

												I’m glad I decided to play this game! The only reason I started playing it was because I finished Saints Row 4 and loved it, which made me want more. As it turns out Saints Row 2 feels like it hardly belongs in the same franchise as the fourth game. Volition have truly reinvented the franchise as they’ve gone from title to title, only keeping the characters and setting as they go. This explains why the people who loved the second game and wanted more of that tend to complain loudly about the third and fourth games. They’re just not the same. Personally I think reinventing and iterating are both equally valid approaches for a series to take. I like the variety, and you certainly can’t accuse them of retreading the same ground like I’ve seen some do with Rockstar and the GTA series.Saints Row 2 came out in 2008, and it feels like a game of its time. It might not seem like 2008 is that far back, but when you play games of that time they all feel old now, as does Saints Row 2. At that time I remember games journalists were talking about emergent gameplay instead of story, and it shows in Saints Row 2’s design. Compared to any major game released in 2013 this feels like complete chaos. Instead of the world acting like a virtual movie set with carefully staged combat, the game instead relies on world simulation systems and AI to act on its own. This approach makes it nearly impossible for a developer to tell a story during missions, because the minute to minute gameplay is completely unpredictable. Instead the designer only choreographs the action with commands like: Go there, kill that, chase that car, etc. Even during missions the world simulation present in the free exploration mode is in full effect. So when you take over areas of the map you’ll have friendly thugs spawn there. If a mission happens to take place there, or a car chase goes through neighborhoods controlled by your gang, groups of friendly thugs will spawn and rain bullets on your pursuers. If during a mission an enemy shoots a civilian standing near you, police will arrive on the scene and start fighting the enemy gangsters with you. The last time I saw this kind of three way combat break out spontaneously was in the Stalker games. I wish we had more games like this, especially on the next-gen consoles where the extra memory and power could allow much more elaborate world simulation. That would in some way fulfill “the point” of next-gen hardware. Making something you couldn’t do on 360/ps3, just like this game is something that couldn’t exist on PS2.Anyway, I had a great time blowing through this game. It’s messy, ugly, glitch, but it all comes together to create something special. One thing I was pleasantly surprised by was the quality of the cutscenes. In Saints Row 4 they were generally very high quality, but in a couple scenes I found the sound to be a bit crap. In Saints Row 2 the sound during cutscenes is phenomenal. It’s raw, violent and has about as much impact as you could hope to have. It fits perfectly with the story itself which in the “Brotherhood” missions turns into an ugly conflict where neither side appear noble or heroic in any way. It’s dark, gruesome and I was even shocked at one scene where the game made it abundantly clear that the player isn’t a hero anyone should aspire to be. So I finally get where the hype about Saints Row 2 has come from. If you know you’re a fan of slightly janky games with outstanding qualities you’ll probably like this. Those wanting a slick, modern, controlled experience should avoid it like the plague.			"

												Warning: be EXTREMELY careful about this PC port.Although Saint's Row 2 is one of my favourite games of all time, this PC conversion is the worst I've ever seen. It really is that bad. Basically, the further away your PC spec is from an Xbox 360 the worse the game will run. (Apparently fixed on Win 8 machines)  It also has numerous bugs, glitches and other ""issues"" and  requires fan-made modding (seriously; REQUIRES) in order to get it to actually work as intended.I will recommend this game, but only if you mod it to work properly. Google ""Gentlemen of the Row"" and then thank the creator with as much free beer as the internet can send.His Steam FAQ link is here: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1715922 "

Pros-The best Saints Row game-Great story that strikes a very good balance of comedy and drama.-The gameplay is fun-Good supporting cast-Freedom to tackle the story however you want-Fun side activitiesCons-Extremely buggy on PC. Install the mod ""Gentleman of the Row"" in order to fix most of the issues.-The fact that you need to gain more notoriety through side quest to be able to continue the main mission can become annoying and tedious.By far the best story in a Saints Row game.

												If you're thinking about getting into the Saints Row series, Saints Row 2 is the best one to start with. If you've already played the later Saints Row games, it's still worth it to go back and play Saints Row 2 (I actually played Saints Row IV before playing Saints Row 2).You start out by creating your character. You can choose your Race, Sex, Body Build, etc. Soon after that, you'll be free to explore the big city. The main story is interesting, but you can also do your own thing and follow the main story at your own pace.Join the Saints!			"

												Let's just clear one thing right off the bat. The PC port of Saints Row 2 is just horrendous. But it doesn't mean Saints Row 2 would be a bad game.Saints Row 2 is in my opinion the best Saints Row game in the series and is well worth the full price since the story missions will last easily for 18 hours on your first playthrough and getting 100% will take probably up to 30 hours. THere's a lot to do and lot to play with but I personally thought the story missions were the strong point of the game. The missions were fun and varied quite a lot. Boss fights were fun yet a little too easy. But that isn't really a big downside since the other missions are so strong.I recommend Saints Row 2 to everyone if you are willing to look past it's problems (which can be fixed with mods, by the way) and give it a shot. You will not regret buying this game.			"

												Some thoughts:I played Saints Row 3 on the Xbox 360 and thought it was the best Saints Row ever (I did not play the others). Although it is a good game, Saints Row 2 is the better game. Why? It takes itself less seriously than GTA but it still has meaningfulness that Saints Row 3 and 4 lack. The gangs are realistic and the campaings are good, whereas the latter games are just crazy. They are fun, but that is pretty much it. Shaundi and Pierce look better in Saints Row 3, but in Saints Row 2 they are likable and are useful and fun to invite around the city. The driving sucks, but the customization is good. Plus, the cheats are better than Saints Row 3! I suggest getting it.... I expected less than Saints Row 3 and got more instead.			"

												It took me and my friend about 3 and a half hours just to setup everything to work. But in the end, it was worth it.i will list here what we did to make the game work just fine, and save you the nightmare we went through to get it to work.So let's start!1.Fixing most bugs -  First of all, as you can see in other reviews aswell, you WILL need to install ""Gentlemen of the row"" mod. It's a mod that fixes many knows bugs and even adds awesome thingies to the game. BUT, i was on windows 7 and GOTR dident fix the fast forward animations bug, but another mod did. (link to GOTR - http://idolninja.com/sr2.php)2.Fixing the fast animations -  So as i mentioned before, i had problems with the fast forward animations, which really annoyed me and i really couldent take it. I was really close to quitting and leaving that game forever and then i found a mod called: ""Saints row 2 Powertools"". after i did as the ""readme"" file told me to, the animations still ran really fast, and i was so dissapointed becuse i really wanted that to work, but it dident. And so just the momment i lost hope, i remembered that there is a configuration file in the mod's files. And if after you put the mod in the folder install it and still it dosent work, you need to go to the game folder, search for a file called: ""Powertools.ini"" open it, go to speed precentage, and set it to 0.9.That solved me the problem and the game ran normally. (link to saint row 2 powertools - http://saintsrowpowertools.com/ )3. Connecting to the internet - My friend wanted at first to use tunngle but it dident really work on my computer for some reason, so he looked for other lan hosting apps, and he found evolve. It's a pretty good softwere and a easy one aswell. My friend installed it, while i already had it. He created a party, and it worked just fine! (link to evolve - https://www.evolvehq.com/welcome ). If your friend hosted a multiplayer coop and you want to join, just go to coop - lan game - choose his server - load or create a new character - ENJOY!So that's all, that's how i made my game work just fine! i hope i helped anyone who needed, and have fun doing stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥in SAINTS ROW 2.

FUN-60%  FRUSTRATION-40%Saints Row 2 can be considered a good fun game for most parts but there are hiccups. Bad porting aside, the game revolves around just killing and destroying stuff all the time. It lacks variety in it's main missions which showed real promise. For argument's sake one can say the game is old and it's not fair be hard on it but there were games way before SR2's time that offered much more variety in missions. The story is not that compelling too. The story is all about you being a prick, going on a killing spree, eliminating other gangs that had taken over the city which the Saints once ruled. May be the charcter was meant to be that way - an arrogant a-hole, who knows?, I found the cockiness annoying. Be forewarned- Port issues like fps drops, crashes, loud cutscenes can get you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off. Fps drops not so much but crashes are a little frequent, atleast once in 2 hours or so. To fix loud cutscene audio i had to fiddle around lowering windows volume level considerably and adjusting in-game sound sliders until i found a good balance between cutscene volume level and in-game volume level.Where the game makes you forget all of this is the Activities and Side Missions part. Its pure fun and can add to atleast half of your playtime. There are tons of activities like brawling, racing, pimping, trailblazing with an ATV, Heli-assault, Drug-trafficking, Insurance Fraud-my personal favourite much like goat simulator, Hitman targets etc. These side activities really make a difference and makes up for the lack of variety in the main missions. If they could've just put in a taste of these during the main missions then it could've been a much better experience overall. May be the core idea here was to offer a direct approach in the main storyline ie, eliminate your foes with guns blazing and chill out later doing these cool/varied activities to brush off the hollow approach or vice-versa. It leaves you with a mixed feeling in the end.        The graphics are decent considering its an old game. The music and voice acting is good though its a bummer you can't use custom mp3s for the radio. Driving, shooting etc are pretty good (I used a controller). Flying helicopters, biplanes etc feels terrific. Essentials: Set Custom Resolution Editor if you need one: http://blog.gib.me/2009/01/06/saints-row-2-resolution-editor/Gentlemen of the Row Mod (fixes a lot of stuff): http://idolninja.com/sr2.phpHigh Quality Radio Mod: https://www.saintsrowmods.com/forum/threads/high-quality-radio-mod.9515/Summary:Its not a bad game by any means but in my opinion it could've done much better in the storytelling department. Considering its an old game and that I had fun, I must say I came out satisfied eventhough it was a bad port. Fans of the series may swear by this game but if you are a newcomer and have played lot of newer similar titles like GTA V, then it may be wise to stick on to newer Saints Row titles. But who am I to say this? You may like SR2 or may not, it all depends on the type of gamer you are and what you expect out of the game. This review may best serve as a heads-up on what the game is about, and to me its a decent game best played if you have nothing else to play.  MY SCORE: 70/100 "

												Saints Row 2 was a lot of fun back then when it was popular. Nobody plays the multiplayer now which means a good part of the game died.Anyway, the singleplayer is still a lot of fun. The story is good. It continues where the story in Saints Row 1 ended, you meet some old friends and try to get control over the city. The story is dramatic but also really funny. You basically got a serious game with a lot of good jokes. The customization is great too, you can make yourself in this game and they also sell all kind of clothes.The multiplayer was IMO the best part. You had different mods like Arms Race in which you played mini games but they also had Death Match modes.			"

												As today marks 7 years since this account's creation, I figured it'd be appropriate to review the reason why it came to exist: the legendary Saints Row 2.After being introduced to the series through ♥♥♥♥ing around on friends' consoles, I didn't know what Steam was, who Valve were nor, amusingly, how PC specs worked; only that I wanted to play it as soon as possible. I didn't have a capable computer at the time and had only been able to play video games with mates, short of the countless hours spent in Age of Empires II and the like.So after buying the disc copy on a whim and, months later, finally getting the necessary PC upgrades, it was activated under something called a Steam account. I was ready to go and, at long last, introduced to Stilwater and the wonderful, seedy world of the 3rd Street Saints.Needless to say, it was just as good as everything I had hoped for. It’s funny, considering all the time that I’d spent leafing through the manual to check out all the insane, balls to the wall action on offer, I still had no idea that the PC version was one of the worst ports ever released. With little to compare it to at the time, you take what you can get and I loved every minute of SR2. Though it must be about five years now since last playing it, Johnny freakin' Gat, Dane Vogel, Aisha, Jane Valderama and the Freckle ♥♥♥♥♥'s ads over the radio are all still part of the many fond memories spent in the Row. The campaign itself is short and you can probably get through it in about 8-10 hours, though back when THQ and GameSpy were still active, co-op greatly extended the replay value. Throw in some hilarious cheats and the sandbox was literally bursting with stuff to do. In the years since, we've seen a significant departure from the GTA influence (and the charming borderline rip-off) of the original games alongside a vastly different industry, but they're no less enjoyable. In fact, Saints Row IV quite possibly stands as my personal favourite of the series and easily one of the best open-world games available. (The throwbacks are especially nostalgic. Remember that pin-up of Shaundi? The hospital escape with Gat? Skee ball and Loa Dust? Good times.) As I’ve already spent plenty of time talking about the good ol’ days, let’s pretend to focus on some relatively objective details quickly. To be clear, SR2 is not a perfect game; it’s not even a great game. Despite holding it in high regard for a time that’s long since passed, the criticisms raised in response to the awful bugs, non-existent optimisation and clear lack of QA testing are all perfectly valid. Thanks to the efforts of the small yet surprisingly dedicated community, a few restoration mods have appeared in recent years, namely the Gentlemen of the Row overhaul, but if you’re hesitant about spending the time to bring this train wreck up to its pulpy, cinematic brilliance, I’d recommend checking out something else. However, if leading the revival of the iconic Saints in an all-out, city-wide gang war, (full of dark humour and fantastic gameplay to boot), seems like your kind of game then look no further. Welcome back, Boss. We all have that one title that we’ve grown with; the game that we’ve spent countless hours in, losing sleep and friends as a result. Saints Row 2 happens to be one of these, and thus, even with all its flaws, it would be a crime not to recommend. Here's to gaming.			"

Long, funny story and map full of side stuff + an Easter Bunny :D Deserves 8,5/10. Too bad the only multiplayer is provided by Lan connection, it's a great fun though.

												Make no mistake, this is a horrible port of Saints Row 2. It may be the worst port of any game ever released. However, thanks to the hard work of modders (one of who now works for Volition), it's playable at a semi-constant 60 frames-per-second. The game itself is amazing, and in many (not all) aspects the high point of the Saints Row franchise. Recommended if you don't mind going through the trouble of modding it to get it in playable condition.			"

I'll start off by saying that the pc port is absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ Even on the best hardware around this game will not stay at a stable 60 fps on high settings. But I still prefer the pc version over the console version. On the xbox 360 and ps3 the game often goes below 30 fps and crashes from time to time. At least the pc version never crashed when I played it and it never went below 30 fps on my pc. Also the online doesn't work anymore because gamespy closed down, so if you want to play with a friend you need to use hamachi or evolve and run a lan game.With that out of the way, let the real review begin.It's one of the most enjoyable games I ever played. It may even be one of my favorite games of all times for many reasons. But the #1 reason has to be the humor and the near perfect balance of semi-serious crime drama and wacky comedy. I found myself laughing almost all the way trough the story. If I like humor so much then why don't I think that SR3 and 4 are better? Well the fun moments are so balanced out that it works that much better. In SR4 it bombards you with funny things but you get too used to it. In SR2 the funny moments are balanced out so that you don't get used to things being whacky and you'll apreciate the fun/whacky moments more for it.There also is the crazy amount of custumization in the game. You can decide at what angle you tilt your hat. I don't think I need to say more than that.The gameplay is pretty standard. It plays like a modern version of the ps2 gta games. But the minigames are amazing. You can join a wrestling club, spray poop on houses to devalue the land,  pretend to get hurt to claim insurance, steal hookers from their pimps, ride a burning quad though the city and more. I'm not kidding. These are actual minigames. There are also standard ones like racing, being a hitman, stealing certain cars, etc. I do hate the fact that you need to complete mini games to unlock story missions but I probably wouldn't have played them otherwise.The music is also pretty good. I really like the 80's radio station. There are cd shops in the city where you can buy music to make a mic tape with to listen to in your car on the way to your next burning quad time trial. (I especially love Out of Touch and Down Under).The entire story is playable in co-op and you will see your own charcter in the cutscenes (not the host's character). What I mean by that is that you will get more enjoyement out of the game itself with a friend while you still expierience the entire story like you were playing alone.My final point is: It's only 10 euros or your regional equivalent when it's not on sale. In the sale it's usually 2,50 euros.This game is easily worth 20 euros. VerdictI love SR2 and I see no reason to not tell you to buy this if you haven't already. And if you are still on the fence wait until it's on sale and get it then.  Having said that I will recommend checking if your pc can run this. The recommended system requirements do not garuantee that the game will work at a stable 30 fps!
