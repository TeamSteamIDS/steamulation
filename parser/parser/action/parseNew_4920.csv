												Very fun first person shooter/real time strategy game crossover. The objective is to destroy all enemy bases.It is Aliens vs. Marines, each side has unique controls, weapons, and strategies.Each player has a first person view, and each team has 1 commander who has a top down view like a real time strategy game, directing the players on the field and giving them support and supplies when needed.A person should first understand the game and all units and structures, learn basic strategy, and play the game for a week or so before attempting to play as the commander.A mic silent game of Natural selection 2 is not a good thing. A player should always speak up if they want an upgrade from the commander, or see an opening for an attack. Do not stay silent and assume your commander or other players see what you see. The more information you share with your team, the better. I have seen countless matches where a team has control of almost all of the map, but end up losing, because they think that they've already won and don't need to communicate anymore. Slowly, the enemy team just wins all the fights and takes back the entire map.This game also has good mod support, with some nice alternative game types, including one similar to gungame from counterstrike, where you simply try to destroy the enemy base, and you get upgrades and get better lifeforms through spending points. You get those points by killing enemies.This game has a learning curve, you can't just jump in and start winning. It will take a lot of practice before you become good.If you were thinking about buying it, you should definitely go for it. If you stick to the game past the learning curve, you will have loads of fun. Plus, the developers are still supporting it with free, very frequent updates, with new content such as new units and weapons, bug fixes and better optimization.			"

												A missed opportunity.  That's all I can call it.  NS2 isn't a bad game.  In fact, despite not personally recommending it, I still think it is a good game.  The problem is that it isn't a game I can recommend to others.  If you look at my hours I'm not someone who hasn't given the game a chance.  In fact, I beta tested the original NS1 mod.   When NS2 was announced and they asked for help to fund it, I purchased a few copies of Zen of Sudoku (another game they produced).  Then, when they were near finished NS2, I pre-purchased the game, sight unseen, long before release.  So I do support the game and the makers.  I just can't recommend it anymore.  Why?  Well the answer can be found in the game's development.The big failure of the game is exactly what happened with NS1.  Basically the developers allowed a small--but vocal and intolerant--minority of players dictate the direction of gameplay development.  These 'pros', are basically the people and clanners who play games competitively and/or in tournaments.  Now I can see wanting to appeal to the 'pro' gamers as a means to generate interest, but there needs to be a balance between competitive and casual play.  Sadly, there never was.  In the end, the difficulty and learning curve puts this game well out of reach of all but the veterans.  New players are quickly steamrolled and wonder how the heck it happened.  What's worse is that they released the game without a trainer or tutorial mode.  While there is a basic 'sandbox' mode that helps to get a player acclimated to the game before they play, it's too little too late.I saw this all happen in NS1, and it saddened me when it happened here.  The competitive gamers basically co-opt the game, and casual players are forced to play at that high level or they don't play at all.  In my opinion, the logical way to develop the game would have been to introduce a 'tournament mode', with increased difficulty, for those dedicated players.  It could have been finely tuned to appeal directly to their form of play, while still leaving the game with a 'casual' player base that could actually play the game.  Unfortunately, the developers objected to this concept suggesting they didn't want there to be 'two games'.  But the reality is that difficulty levels are part of gaming.  That doesn't make it ""two games"", it makes it one game with two difficulty levels.  With the development team basically abandoning casual players, this basically meant that no matter how many sales they made, the new players never stuck around.  If you look at the history of the game, you will see that from the release in late October 2012 until the end of 2012, there was a large player base that bought the game and was playing.  Since everyone was still learning, it meant there was the potential for developers to cater to that casual player base and build their numbers further.  Instead, they went the other way, abandoning the casual player base in favor of the competitive and tournament players.Over on Steamcharts you can see just how the game started strong and then flamed out in a spectacular fashion.  ( steamcharts.com/app/4920 )   The all-time peak number of players online was just a bit shy of 10K.  At time of writing there were ~200 playing.  It's sad, it really is, since this could have been a much better overall game.The nail in the coffin for this game was when development for 'game balance' was put in the hands of volunteers.  Since the game is easy to modify (in the LUA scripts), balance changes didn't have to be hard coded into the game.  As such, a bunch of people who felt they 'knew better' how the game should be developed were able to markedly influence balance changes by verbally bullying anyone who disagreed with them.  Anyone who dared question those who wanted to make the game harder were verbally ridiculed and harassed.  The game forums became toxic as a result, and casual players began their exodus. Well, those competitive players got what they wanted.  The game is exactly how they said it should be balanced.  It's too bad there is hardly anyone left playing now.  What's worse is that the more appealing elements of the game--the highest level 'upgrades'--only show up when the outcome of the game is predetermined.  (which happens within the first few minutes)  Users who look and see the marine 'mech' robots and the 'rhino-size' alien don't realize that they will likely rarely if ever get to play them.  This game is a good example of what *not* to do when developing a game.  While I can see the appeal of competitive gaming to a game like this, it can't be at the expense of casual gamers.  Otherwise you kill the potential for the game to grow.  Look at TF2.  A game that is 'easy', but that can be hard based on the skill of the players.  That could have been how NS2 ended up.  Instead, the game is harder than ever.  What's worse is that they added a ranking system to which isolates players based on skill.  New players will find game choices limited as a result.Simple example of a poor balance choice?  In TF2, if you need to get health, you can pick up health kits (on the field or in spawn) and also be healed by the doctor.  In NS2 it used to be you could go to 'spawn' and heal up fully (health and armor) at the armory--like a med cabinet in TF2 spawn--and you could get health-only medkit drops in the field.  If one was away from spawn, armor could only be repaired with a welder. (like a medigun, except anyone could carry one if they bought it.)  However, the competitive complainers cabal (I love alliteration) pressured the person doing balance work to make it so the armory would no longer heal players.  In other words, once you lost armor you needed to be welded, and you can't weld yourself--other players have to do it.  The outcome of this change was that it made it that much harder for players to stay alive unless they are highly skilled.  In the end, I still play NS2, and I would recommend it to anyone who I felt had the skill to survive.  However, there aren't very many people who fit that description.  Unless you are someone who considers themselves an exceptionally good FPS player, I would advise you give the game a pass unless it is deeply discounted and you're willing to take the chance the game may not be fun for you.  While NS2 is--on the surface--a good game, it missed its chance to be a great one.			"

												It is unfortunate that in today's world despite the astounding technological advancements there are few games that actually surprise you with their novelty and innovation when putting this new arsenal of potential to use. However, Natural Selection 2 is twice as surprising in this regard as it innovates not in one, but two genres simultaneously. The concept of an FPS/RTS hybrid has been around for quite some time though never properly executed by any major title in gaming. This has always puzzled me as there is no greater satisfaction than seeing a game unfold from both the perspective of an overarching command and the boots on the ground itself. While Natural Selection 2 is a purely multiplayer experience it excels in bring new exciting gameplay to the stagnating genre of first person shooters, most of which have simply resorted to throw bigger guns, toys, and vehicles at you. Instead Natural Selection 2 recognizes the strengths of its predecessors innovative gameplay and polishes it to make an impressive new clean-cut version of a game every gamer should try at least once. While this game truly shines because of its innovation and creativity it does not spare any expense on its presentation either as all the character and alien models are fantastic and really brought to life by the dynamic lighting, sounds, and overall atmosphere that is simply blooming in this games thematic atmospheres.The first thing I noticed jumping into a lobby of NS2 is that cooperation between teammates is not only recommended but essentially necessary. This is absolutely phenomenal! There are too few games in this is online gaming world that actually demand that you interact with gamers in such a way as to properly execute a plan rather than everyone simply going at it alone, lone-wolf style. I've played my fair share of both Call of Duty and Battlefield and neither of those two triple-A giants require you to communicate with your teammates as much as NS2. If the new gaming era is going to strip us of local multiplayer and let us only play with strangers online, then they better give us a reason to want to talk to these people, and NS2 does just that by making the alternative to cooperation abject failure.The reason that cooperation is so essential in NS2 is because of its unique gameplay featuring 2 asymmetrical sides, the aliens vs. humans, and furthermore one player on each side must be chosen as your Commander/Hive mind, who will view the entire map from above and play the RTS portion of the game building, giving orders, and researching upgrades. The twist of course being that apart from a few builder units the Commander/Hive mind has no forces under his direct control but only the other players on his team who benefit most from executing his orders. Again, cooperation is paramount and having seen the difference between a skilled commander and bumbling one you really get to understand just how effective or ineffective you can be as a player or a leader.As for the gameplay as a soldier on the ground, the games generally proceed as follows. You will run out of your initial base to go seize the nearest resource point with your teammates and if you manage to control it without the enemy showing up then you will continue on to the next one. However, due to the impressive array of maps and the units/upgrades available to the different sides, you can never truly be sure just how easy or hard an objective given to you by your commander will be. Let us discuss some of the key differences between the sides at this point. The human marines are standard enough beginning the game with an assault rifle, pistol and trusty little hand axe. Throughout the game their commander will be attempting to accrue enough resources to get them upgrades such as shotguns, flamethrowers, jetpacks, better shielding, damage upgrades, and eventually mech suits. While all of these things seem like surefire upgrades from the starter equipment the truth is any of it is only as useful as the player who wields it. The aliens on the other hand begin the game as the base unit known as the skulk, an equivalent of a zergling more or less which can only effectively attack via melee. They however, are naturally much faster at moving about and can make use of the maps numerous vents which marines cannot enter. These skulks can then evolve throughout the game into other creatures ranging from the builder/medic class of the Gorge, the swift flying Lerk, the deadly Fade and the almighty Onos. Each of these creatures has its own unique strengths, weaknesses and special abilities and knowing when to use each one is critical in being a good alien player.Returning to the gameplay itself, there are some caveats to be given to new players. This game is rather unforgiving and those who are not any good at shooters on the PC will not find any user-friendly playground here. Though there are beginner level servers they are often such only in name and host just as many veteran players as any other server. Gameplay is rather fast and frenetic and you may often find yourself saying things like ""How didn't I hit that guy!?"" or ""4 of us ambushed him! How did he kill us all!?!"" And unfortunately if there is one thing to be said about this game is that the learning curve is about as steep as the Hoover dam. That is not to say that the community for the game isn't great, because since servers and players can sometimes be limited, dedicated gamers will do their best to teach newbies the ropes every chance they get. Yet despite the helpful tutors you'll run across you can't help but feel that the majority of people you are playing with in this game have simply come over from the Counterstrike community and have years of practice and experience over you. That being said, if you happen to be a CS gamer, this is your bag and you will feel right at home. The truth is however, that despite sometimes going all game without even a kill, I could still make a difference in the match through my targeting of key objectives or even posing as a distraction for my teammates who could actually effectively hit a moving target. This is what makes NS2 so brilliant, that even if you aren't your teams Rambo who CAN take on 4 aliens at once, there is always something that you can do to make yourself useful, and if you really must learn how to be a Rambo then simply practice, practice, practice, and eventually you may get... your first kill. All jokes aside, there is such a vast gap between some players in the NS2 community and while the game may not be as accessible to newcomers as I would like, it generally tends to balance out throughout games.Overall NS2 is a real treasure for all gamers and tells the success story of an ambitious group of modders who managed to create a revolutionary game that I believe has not gotten the attention it deserves. If more studios focused on innovation rather than repackaging and retheming then we would have more games with the spirit and uniqueness of NS2. The FPS/RTS is still a largely underused genre and yet probably my favorite, and while NS2 may have a steep learning curve which may prevent it from being my go-to just because I don't have the time to dedicate to mastering it, it is still an unforgettable and incomparable gaming experience from which larger studios should learn from.

												This game, while also being one of my favorites, should be much more recognized by the community. While I understand that game review is subjective as all hell. Many people have shot this game down as it is different. Further concurring on the theory that innovation in video games is not truly desired by video gamers. This game is innovative, becoming it's own genre of video game that Steam does not have a tag for. Notes about the game(I believe a pros and cons list to be inadequate)-I, as an experienced StarCraft II player, have found commanding to be enjoyable, but slightly more dumbed down than a regular RTS. This is further multiplied by the simplicity of alien commanding. This, however, makes it easy for new players to pick up commanding-The FPS action is incredibly tense, with the players having to turn off all other sources of sound or music to listen for footsteps or instructions from the commander.-One concern I had when first starting was that I only liked playing marines, and I'm sure others have similar issues. I quickly learned that I could easily enjoy playing both sides. One must understand what they enjoy about each team before truly finding enjoyment. -This game is- in my experience on the NA servers- generally underpopulated. However, as of the Winter sale of 2015-2016, their has been a huge surge of new players, strengthening the community and playerbase. Helpful tips--Be nice to rookies. The one thing that solidified my enjoyment of this game was a kind player urging me to be my best and guiding me when I had just began. A little kindness towards new players can and will strengthen the player base.-Carry a welder. Welders are cheap, available without any research, and can be truly vital in tense situations. Repairing a friendly's armor, or a marine in an exosuit can mean the difference between winning and losing.-As a skulk, remember that your life is less valuable than higher life forms. Remember to never be afraid to initiate a fight, with a higher life form like a fade or onos following suit. You will most likely die but you have paved the way for your team to win a fight without losing any important or expensive life forms.-Conceding can sometimes be the only option. Remember that there is always the option to concede by hitting x, and then selecting concede. Sometimes it is best, when new players join to just start fresh and hope for more even teams.Final comments-Natural Selection 2 is a fantastic game, made by fantastic developers that are constantly updating and listening to community feedback.I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys fast-paced action, is able to communicate well with others without getting in fights(my brother has this issue), and can be a good loser, because a loss can sometimes be inevitableHappy Hunting!

												This is one of the most unique games that I've played in quite some time.  The community is small, and the learning curve is steep.  Once you get past those, and fight in some balanced matches, you'll be hooked.  Admittedly, the skill gap between players can be drastic and result in some very one sided matches.  There are servers out there they do a pretty good job of evenly matching up teams, but you'll have to do some digging.			"

												Natural Selection 2 is a Multiplayer team-based First Person Shooter & mixed Strategy game, with an awesome twist. One team are Human Marines ""Frontiersmen"" and the other are Alien Lifeforms ""Kharaa"", each team featuring a completely asymmetrical way of playing against the other, making the gameplay very diverse and versatile, yet very balanced. The marines, mainly relying on ranged weapons technology like rifles, shotguns etc VS the aliens that will ambush lonely unsuspecting marines by jumping down from dark corners in the ceilings in dark hallways or flying past scared marines chewing on their legs or exposing them to lethal toxins like poisonous gas.NS1 was a mod from 2002 developed until 2007 for the GoldSRC (Half-Life) engine which was very popular #1 HL mod(moddb.com), and in the last few years, a few original key people formed the company Unknown Worlds Entertainment to work on NS2 to become real, a sequel on its own engine with more than 150,000 owners and thousands of daily players, AAA-quality, released Nov 2012, and still being supported and developed with many updates each month even one year later. The developers won't abandon this game like many other developers do. The game has an awesome community not only noticable in-game, some of which helped crowdfund the developement of the game before it was even Beta-released; or contributing huge amounts of cash to help funding further huge updates to the game like massive new maps, new features lifeforms and revolutionary changes etc etc etc.The game is played in servers with player numbers ranging from 2 - ~32 players, however my sweet spot is around 16-20 players. (Note some n00b admins run some 32p servers on ancient server hardware causing bad experiences, beware)Each team has one player as the commander giving giving the game an amazing RTS addition, whom anyone can choose to be.Even after several hundred of hours you won't get bored or tired of the game. It only gets more and more fun the more immersed you get. The tension and fun of this game is 100% guaranteed Addictive! =)			"

Posted: August 20, 2015
												Yesterday I purchased a four pack and played this with friends... that is where this review's experience comes from and the questions I want to answer are these to follow...1: Is this a noob friendly game ...2: Does natural selection have a good community a few years later after its release?3: Is it worth it?4: Machanics of the game..Lets start with the machanics ... #4 : Natural Selection 2 is a asymetric RTS/FPS hybrid that pits two different species against eachother to battle for resources in order to gain map control and better tech .  The Marines side is best for startes , its more streight forward and self explanitory. If you like call of duty or Titan fall than the marines will feel at home with you. As a marine you will need to dodge , strafe and jump often to avoid the bites of aliens and their pesky projectiles that will murder you VERY FAST! so dtay afoot. Each side has a commander who will order you the player to make and construct buildings and power nodes to expand your region of power ( Map control ) , early and mid game sentries are amazing to stop or mitigate a rush to an expansion if placed right by the commander. Late game Sentries add to the horde of your firepower so dont hesitate regardless of what players may tell you , sentries can still kill people in the end game. Now the aliens side... as the aliens you must spread infestation and build structures as the commander , they play much like the zerg from Starcraft. The aliens have a few distinct species , the Skulk who is what you as a player will initially spawn as. Skulks are fast if used correctly so wall jump often to build up momentum and use your speed to do circles around the ankles of a exo suit or marine to kill them becuase skulks have very low health. Than we have the gorge , a pig styled alien builder who can make or brake the aliens flow of battle by placing mini turrets called hydras , walls called clogs , minions to assist and tunnels to move the aliens a great distance to where they or you may need to be. Continuing on we have the bird ( cant remember the bloody name ) , a flyer who is very fast and cna bite / shoot projectiles to kill marines very fast , great for taking out a straggler or two on your way to a base. And onto the Fade , an assasin with a lot more hp  , use the fades ability to travel insanely fast around marines , confusing and disorientng them as you tear them apart limb from limb. Finally... The ONO'S ... a ultralisk - ish feel to them indeed as these tanky titans stampede through a squade of marines like scissors through paper , their only rivals being the exo suit and grenade luanchers which cost a pretty penny for marines and commanders alike. Machanics in a gist , Team work is a massive need so listen to the commander and do as he / she tells you becuase YOU are the unit of this RTS. Map control and aggresion are key to victory. A good marine with a jet pack can turn the tide of a infestation in a jippy with the commanders support , likewise a good fade can end a large scale assult in the right hands. Skill and stratigy combine in this game.Now is this Noob friendly... TBH , in my experience it is rare to find players who wont vote to kick you for being a new player , as a rookie your name will be green until you have reached a certain number of hours played on the game. So its very noticable if you are a new player. Even in "" Rookie only servers "" veterans will join and the balance that was once there will dicipate into a one sided fight very quickly. So If and onlly if the community was larger than yes this would be noob friendly but as of now , the community is quite small.Community : Is it good??? TBH in the few hours ive played I thought about going back to League of Legends becuase players here are very hostile to newer inexperienced players like myself. Only one server welcomed my scrubdubbery with open arms and there i learned how to play. Finnaly is it worth a buy???? Yes! , even though the community of this game is somewhat toxic , if you buy a four pack , its great with friends and great when you can actually play an all rookie game when you start out. the tutorial explains a good bit but not all of what you need to know , there is a low learning curve to the game and if you enjoy fps games , this is a new twist on a genre thats been stale for some time.

												I don't normally review games, but Natural Selection 2 is a special case.For the tl;dr version- -Pros: Great game concept, smooth controls, intense gameplay, teamwork definetely required. -Cons: No progression systemI picked up this game a while ago, considering it among the many other great games I had in mind, but I still decided to experiment, and I spent my money on it. I was slightly wary of this purchase though, as I have made bad choices in games in the past, but I decided it was worth a shot. I started it up, and as soon as I joined my first lobby, immediately loved it. The game concept is great, merging a sort of warped MOBA with an First person shooter. Throw some aliens in there and basiclly sums it up.The game in essence is a moba, with two teams going at eachother, trying to destroy a immoble structure, but its so much more complicated then that. At the begining of the game, a commander is chosen for each team, a commander for the marines, and the ""Queen"" for the aliens. To win, the marine must destroy the Aliens ""Hive"" structure, where the Queen operates, and the aliens must destroy the Marines Command Station. Basiclly, the Commander/Queen is like Battlefield 4's Conquest mode, where either team's commander can virtually call in support, ping key points on map, research new weapons or technologies, and generally advise the team. Resources are important to either team. They are gained from building extractors, and can be used to buy upgrades, and weapons.However, the Marines are arguably as important, if not moree, then the commander. While commander can call in buildings, it takes the Marines to actually construct them. The marines also do all the fighting, their arsenal consisting of a medium range assault rifle, pistol secondary, and combat hatchet. (God I love that unholster animation) The Commander can research new weapons to add to the arsenal, including shotguns, landmines, and a range of grenades. Mid-to-late game, the Commander can order a lab drop, which lets you buy (with enough resources,) flame throwers, or exo-suits. Marines expand their territory by building facilities, such as power generators, then extractors, and so forth. If Marines can get multiple bases running, they can build teleports, which let you sweep across the map faster.For the Aliens, the game is very similar, yet so different. The ""Queen"" (Alien's commander) gets a skyhigh view of the map from her hive. She can ping areas, advise the team, and spread the infestation across the area. The aliens are very diverse. The default alien is a skulk. It appears to be some sort of hybrid of a crab, and a hyena or something. They run much faster then marines, can scale walls, or even crawl across the ceiling, even using vents to their advantage. Their default melee can kill a Marine in 2 or 3 hits. It also has a far weaker range, called Parasite.The second alien, and cheapest to evolve into, is the Gorge It generally resembles a turtle/hippo, with a swollen belly. It's attacks are all range, and involve it spitting up on Marines. But the Gorge's main purpose is to support. It can build Infestations, which cover rooms with swells of green goo. It's primary attack can also heal allies.Lerks are the third cheapest alien evolutions. They resemble pterodactyls, and flies around, quickly striking down Marines at close combat, or picking them off with their ranged spikes. Very agile and hard to hit, Lerk's are a fresh pain in the♥♥♥♥♥for Marines. The second most expensive evolution is the fade, the Fade is virtually an alien assassin, that can leap, teleport, and fade itself into invisiblity. Leaves Marines Wondering what hit them.The biggest evolution there is, usually a mid-to-late game version, is the Onos. Basiclly the alien equivalent of an exosuit, this thing appears to be a huge rhino, dinosaur mother hubbard that charges its way through enemy lines. It absorbs damage in its shell, and excels at smashing Marine structures to pieces.The game is amazingly fun to play, and much more diverse then the average moba. Unfortunately, there are a few cons. There is literally no progression systems. Of course, good Mobas really don't need them, as progression is'nt the point of the game. (Unless you play LoL, and your spending twenty bucks on a revealing outfit for your female champion.) But there are not even leaderboards, apart from some server's fanmade versions.The other problem I have with this game is its rarely updated. Currently there is 4 maps, but I believe there is definetely room for more. Of course, the way most of the game is already is pretty balanced, and trying to change the roots of it would not be good, but this game needs some DLC. Some kind or reskin, weapon modifications, anything.Overall this game deservers 8, or even 9 out of 10. It is one of my favorite games, and I hope to enjoy this game for many more years. "

												This used to be my favorite game. For 3 years, I played this game religiously and logged as many hours as I had in CS:S and TF2 previously. At a time, I would have rated this game much higher than both of those AAA titles. Sure, the public servers were always and still are a bad case of teamstacking due to a lack of in-game matchmaking or a proper team skill balancing system, and the game released full of bugs and was terribly optimized leading to an immediate and huge dropoff of players and dooming the game to a tiny community for the rest of it's existence... but the core game was an excellent foundation, and over the years with the help of the balance mod ""CompMod"" and ""Pub Friendly Comp Mod"" by Dragon as well as key quality of life mods like ""NS2+"" by mendasp and ""Shine"" by Ghoul (not to mention some long needed bug fixes and optimization), the game became great. The greatest game I ever played.But not anymore. I can no longer recommend this game for anyone. Not for any price, not even if it was free; I wouldn't wish this abomination of a game upon anyone. The developers (UWE), in some misguided attempt to help ""new player retention"", using some bizarre reasoning to ""help the game grow"" have actually started killing their own game. The most popular servers for the last 3 years, now dead. The one league there was for this game: dead. The games only competitive matchmaking system (NSL gathers): dead. The amazing mod ""CompMod"" mentioned before? Dead, with random features from it stripped and screwed with and thrown into the vanilla game in a poor attempt to ""shake up gameplay"".The developers of this game have ignored the community for so long, and their continued ignorance has now ruined the game for me, and so many like me. F*ck UWE. F*ck NS2.UWE: The balance is f*cked, and NS2's most loyal players are quitting and moving on, the majority of the remaining community hates you and your most dedicated and essential modders are sick of dealing with you.

												Natural Selection 2 has been my go-to multiplayer game for years.If not for modded servers, I would have quit playing a long, long time ago.Recently, the devs currently still making changes to the game have decided that modded servers don't represent what they want the game to be.  As a result, they've made changes to the game in an effort to destroy the biggest community the game still has left.  I can no longer recommend this game to anyone as this behaviour by the dev team is actively destroying what fun there is left to experience.  The devs keep making changes no one is asking for, and soon there will be no one left to play with as a result. "

												I love this game.  The action is fast paced but requries thought (tactically and strategically).  You don't just run in guns blazing, but you need to work with your teammates.  It's a perfect mix of FPS and RTS.  Biting marines as a skulk is fun too.Some say this game has a high learning curve.  Maybe it does, but I don't think so.  You work with your team, collect resources, and then you and your team can afford to buy upgrades -- oh yeah, and kill the other team while trying to prevent them from collecting resources and upgrading.  Is that hard?  Try the tutorials.  Start on newbie-friendly servers. USE A MIC and ask for direction.  It's a relatively small community and most players are very willing to help people who are looking to learn.Try it out.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.			"

												This game is fast-paced, unique, challenging and incredibly rewarding, because even after hundreds of hours of playtime, you still make progress and learn new things. No two matches are alike, and - if you're willing to spend the initial time required to get familiar with the concept - you'll find yourself playing a game that's balanced, and where teamwork is the winning factor in your play.If you're the person that likes games where strategy matters and teamplay & communication are more valuable than just individual skill, this is for you.If you're the person that likes a mature community and player base (...we all know there are exceptions everywhere) where you actually talk to the opposing team after the match is over, complimenting them on their play and/or discussing the previous round, this is definitely for you.However: If you're the solo-rambo kind of guy who likes to be on top of the score list and not be dependent on anything or anyone: Don't buy this. You will not like this.			"

												My all-time favorite multiplayer FPS.At this point, balance is about as even as it's going to get for an FPS with asymmetrical teams, and the developers (both Unknown Worlds and the Community Dev Team) have added a significant amount of content in a number of rather sizable updates. The community is still quite active and is far less dickish than most, which, to me, is a rarity in this age of games going out of style once they're no longer the flavor of the month.The gameplay, while obviously an FPS, is very much dependent upon the strategic layer, and vice versa. What this means is that the commander's role is absolutely vital to the success of the players on foot, and their capability to win their encounters affects whether or not he can expand; it's not like Nuclear Dawn or some other RTS/FPS hybrids where one element is gimped or neutered while the other is fleshed out.My only complaint would be the devs' tendency to change things unnecessarily every other week, with minor balance patches or changes throwing the whole game out of whack. The game as it is now is NOT the same game it was at launch, not by a long shot. If you can keep pace with the changes and roll with the punches, however, it's excellent fun.One crucial tip for new players would be to use your microphone, if you have one (I know you do). Communication with your team is key. Don't be afraid to pipe up on voice, and always keep an eye on your map (bound to the C key by default).			"

												I bought this game I believe 2 years ago and I was absolutely in love with it for quite some time and played it quite a bit. But patch after patch has reduced the game into an elitist circlejerk that represents the gaming community and its forums. New players are looked down upon so badly for not even knowing what certain abilities or effects aliens can use. And not just new players, but anyone who has a differing opinion really to the mainstream elitist mentality. The community is completely toxic to normal people and their peasant opinions. ""git gud"" basically. Good luck to new players with green names because if you don't clock in at least 60 hours, people give you♥♥♥♥♥♥for ""sucking."" The good ones from the community have nearly all left and now all ns2 has are the dregs of idiotic narcissts who are there to pad their hive score that only the 15 remaining competitive people in the whole world even give a rat's♥♥♥♥♥about now. The community used to be fun and an absolute blast back when large servers such as Wooza's and modded servers were the most popular. They were popular for a good reason because it was actually fun to play. The dev's ruined that now by ""hiding"" those servers thus essentially killing off their biggest playerbase: casual/light gamers. People need to get their high horse out of their asses and understand that not everyone can clock in 1k+ hours and even those that do just want to relax and enjoy a good game at the end of the day. Not be two big macs away and a diet coke from a bursting a vein. Now the only 3-4 servers that you can play in NA are just completely ruined either due to terrible balance between the two races or just simply being full almost 24/7. And if you want to join an EU server because you happen to play at 7 AM, good luck because EU/Russia doesn't want our laggy comcast asses. So have fun in the 4 NA servers that are left. Which btw, there's always one or two guys who absolutely carry one team the entire time and you are just praying that they leave. Until another 4k hive score guy comes in. As far as patches go, the game is pretty unbalanced as of patch 299. Several of my fellow ns2 players are leaving solely because of this patch. They each have 1k - 2k hours. That in itself speaks volumes of how the devs only listen to the circlejerking community of the top 10 players who constantly whine about adding stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥like a broken OP HMG while consistently nerfing aliens because they miss ns1 but don't want to go and play ns1. Instead they want to make ns2 become ns1 with fancier graphics. And also ♥♥♥♥ing up aliens. Thank god Overwatch will be out in a couple days from now. I can finally uninstall this increasingly frustrating, broken, elitist, ♥♥♥♥ing game. Thank you blizzard. "

												This review is made to present you my community. Recently all the 24+ servers (as well as modded servers) got removed from the default server browser view. With that change people will no longer be able to find an important part of this community.This is Woozas. Oldest and most popular NS2 servers alive.Are you looking for fun, without being moderated by every action? After 2.5 years we only have 5 bans in total.Do you like playing with others? With a lot of people? Wooza's Playground has 42 slots waiting for you. We also have Wooza's Hamster Wheel with 32 slots.You don't understand why some server hoster want to generate money? We neither. You can create your own badges and receive skins for free.Do you have problems finding your way into the game? Use text or voice chat and ask us anything! We are happy to help!Are you curious what other modders did with this game? We have servers running almost every game mode that is working! We also have a good relation to most modders and support them. If you are looking for competitve games (6vs6), our community highly recommends to join the ESNL Community[www.ensl.org]. They looking for newcomers. And we love to watch competative tournaments! Meanwhile many competitive players have quit the game because the developers do not care about another big community and their ""rapid update iteration"" broke the balance mod for compet so many times, that they decided to quit.Whatever you are looking for, NS2 has it!Just keep in mind that after recent changes  24+ slot and modded servers are both hidden from the server browser by default, as intended by the devs.Use the filters on top and press ""MODDED"" to see all NS2 servers and join the fun.Fun fact: The developers increased the limit of slots from 24 to 99 which means that our servers are now officially supported and part of NS2. We don't run any balance changes, our servers running completly vanilla NS2, but the devs still claims that our servers are ""modded"". Funny right?Join our Community[discord.gg] chat or add me as friend in Steam if you have any questions regarding the game or setting up a server.Thank you for reading this.-Wooza			"

												I'll tell you why you may want to skip over NS2, but let me start on a positive note.NS2 is a bold step in an industry full of very similar multiplayer experiences. Multiplayer is asymmetrical, with each team featuring multiple classes and vastly different approaches to play between teams. Rounds require the participation of not only individual teammates and their skill, but also the (micro)management skills of a commander, acting in an RTS role. These factors lead to NS2 having not only very deep tactical gameplay, but also a very large skill curve to climb and become immersed in. The results of fully embracing and immersing yourself in these systems can lead to a very fun and utterly different kind of gameplay which is truly one-of-a-kind.Now I'm going to tell you why you may want to pass on getting this game.Unless you are prepared to adopt the committed ethic and mindset of a competitive gamer when going in, you're going to have a very rough time; or at least a very inconsistent experience. The difficulty curve is downright brutal. Maps are huge, complex sprawls with a lot of tactical options hidden away in the architecture and terrain placement. They take a lot of time to learn. Gameplay, even for the human side (which you'd think is in more familiar territory for most people) is not too hard to get a handle on at first, but the leap from functional play to consistently effective technique is ENORMOUS. It also does not help that the core community of this game consists of very talented and highly competitive players that one of them alone can stack a team to an almost assured victory.The other major problem that this game presents for new players is related to its greatest strength - its complexity and essential reliance on communication and teamwork for success. This depth ensures almost DOTA-like skill and tactical moments to shine in league play, but in pub play it is a different story. The reliance of one person, the commander, to basically support the rest of the team to ensure victory can be a huge liability in pub play, as having the wrong guy in the commander chair can spell instant doom for a match - very frustrating when it happens consistently. Unlike a lot of other games, like Battlefield and Team Fortress, in which throwing a lot of like-minded players at common objectives usually results in emergent teamplay, constant voice and text communication is essential to a fun and successful game in NS2. Sometimes you get lucky and have a lot of teammates who communicate effectively and listen to orders from the commander. A lot of the time, this isn't the case, and it's frustrating.Because of the aforementioned complexity, another problem arises. A small mistake by the commander, or players under him/her can lead to the team's doom in the early stages of the game. Most of the time everything goes smoothly early on and you roll the team, or you lose a battle early on and it's all over.Anyways, at the end of the day, I'll say this. If you're prepared to immerse yourself in NS2 completely - make it your religion, as you would with a game like DOTA - you're probably going to have a great time with its tactical complexity and heavy reliance on teamwork. If you're not that hardcore, you're going to play an interesting game, with interesting levels, but with an enormous skill curve and a lot of frustration trying to deal with players who seemingly cannot be killed or bested in any way.Me, I'm not that hardcore. I played the game, it was fun while it was interesting, but after 50 hours I can see some of the complex mechanisms move about and I realize I'm simply not a bad enough dude to become one of those 142 - 2 k/d kinds of players that you'll no doubt run into if you play this game.

												Great game with awsome play style and mechanics but a lack of players and very few people willing to play commander kill this game and those few who play are people who never touched a girl and will rage at the sight of a new player. Hell at one point among the tryhards they complained that the servers should have a 600hr restriction before being able to join. I think that the best thing to do is make it free to play so a wave of new players come in and fill the servers.			"

												I'm a hard fan to please. I want a game thats easy to learn but hard to master. Natural Selection 2 (NS2) is just that, a perfect blend of both RTS and FPS. It can satisfy the most demanding fast twitch high intensity gamers or the casual pubbers looking to watch / help those battling it out for map control. Typical days I find myself jumping on to a server for 20 minutes, before dinner, or spending 2 hours helping to keep a server alive, with action, until midnight. Regardless if your a rookie or expert NS2 has a place for you, find out what your missing!			"

												I can’t believe I haven’t reviewed this game yet after 150+ hours into it. But I have returned from a long hiatus to play this game and again and I thought it was time for a review. In a world filled with boring repetitive multiplayer shooters where you run around like a chicken with their head cut off comes a game like Natural Selection 2. A game that ACTUALLY understands the point of competitive multiplayer. TO WORK AS A TEAM!You play as Aliens or Marines. The marines are fairly standard and easy to get the hang of. For the most part I’m a rather good marine player. Aliens are trickier and require more practice. While I’m not a great alien player I’m decent-ish. In other words I still manage to get more than 5 kills. Overall the game requires teamwork and strategy opposed to lone wolfing it. If you run off on your own you will die. You need to be supported by your team members. Also the game is farily well balanced as I did not notice any major balance issues. Highly recommended: 9/10 Great game.  "

												NS2 is a great game and i really do like it alot. I just cannot recommend it to anyone new because the ship has sailed in more ways than 1. The main issue is the community, don't get me wrong the playerbase is generally very friendly and accepting of newcomers, it is mostly a plesant experience and they are pretty dedicated to the game. It's just that it's rather small these days and the players who remain are really damn good, even with the basic tools and classes. You will be the equivilant a Star Trek Redshirt for a long time untill you eventually reach a point where you can at least get some objectives done, and even then you will still be lightyears behind the community skill level, it's so far ahead in fact that i fear that new comers won't catch up, you will spend alot of time lost and dead. As a result i just can't recommend this to anyone now simply because i don't think you'll get enjoyment from it. Which is a shame because the asymetical RTS gameplay is otherwise great.			"

												So yeah, you might be looking at my hours and think that i play games way too much, and you would be right.Natural selection 2 is by far the most enjoyable game i've played, and even when i burn myself out on it, i always find myself coming back.ProsExtremely teamwork orientatedDeep and complex gameplay, deceptivly simple, no game ever feels the same, and plays out differently depending on the types of players.You don't have to be a great shot to help out your  team in a big way, one player can win the game by constantly preasureing the enemy's undefended resource nodes, starveing them of crucial medpacks and upgrades.Marine commander gameplay is incredibly tense and fast paced, even morso than the shooter part of the game, there is always somthing to do, someone to med, something to research. Extremely varied playstyles for each lifeform and weapon, lerks and fades favour hit & run tactics and kill-focused playstyles, wheras the gorge is almost entirely a support role. Two different commander roles that play completely different. every marine weapon serves a different purpose. Jetpacks change the way marines can engage, and Exos change the way aliens have to engage. Very skill based. there is not many things in this game that can get you kills without some level of skill, and to play decently you need to learn the maps, and have a good memory-map of your surroundings, and be VERY aware of sounds. Sound based gameplay makes it feel different to other games.In NS2, oftentimes i'll be calling out what i hear in the next room, or i'll hear a faint click of a skulk, giving away his hiding spot. Hearing the marine reloading, giving you a 2 second window to get some free hits.you need to be very aware in this game, and i would say being able to know how many, and exactly where skulks/marines are before you enter a room is the most crucial skill to have. Every game plays out differently Generaly friendly community (at least in AUS, i cannot speak for the rest of the world.) Cons  Steep learning curve. the game can take a good amount of time to learn how to play decently, and it is not a game you can pick up casualy and play well in. it takes some amount of time investment to get the most out of Ns2.Especially when learning to play aliens, as they play drasticly diffrent to anythnig else from other games. and i would reccomend checking out one of my guide videos  here  if you want to play alien more effectivly. Rookies cannot just jump into the commander role. Being such a crucial role, many people do not like inexperienced players jumping in without asking first, or someone volunteering to teech them (i do that all the time) so expect to not see that portion of the game for a while unless you use a mic, or someone offers to teach you.And on AUS servers, it isn't unheard of to have a rookie command, with someone like myself coaching them. Some players can get quite hostile and newer player, but in my experience it happens far less often on AUS server than on NA ones. that said, don't let it get to you, and try to communicate, i've found it becomes quite hard for some people to yell at someone who has a voice, because suddenly they aren't just words-on-a-screen (same goes for any other game) ""Stacking"" Though oftentimes, it is unintentional, some amount of games end up with most of the experienced players on one team, making for a very short and unenjoyable game for both parties.It is often up to the players to fix the problem, though certain mods do try to deal with the problem (or make it worse in soem cases)In AUS, we may try to pick teams manually, and swap a few players around to improve the balance a little. to avoid these sorts of games, but when people aren't willing the game can get quite frustrating.SummaryI wholeheartedly reccomend this game to anyone that enjoys communicating and working with other people. as well as strategy, and fast paced shooters. this game has it all, and no other game is as addicting as ns2 to me :DI have some more detailed notes on some of the topics above, but i am running out of time, so i'll leave it to you to read them if you so wish.CommunityIn the negative reviews, one of the main complaints i see is of the ""toxic"" community, and the low playerbase.I can't speak for the other parts of the world, but in AUS, everyone knows each other, and as long as rookies make an effort to listen, and take advice, and even better, use a mic or type back! no-one treats them any different.And even in aus, where the playerbase can't be any more than 100 people, there is ALWAYS a server running in peak times, the playerbase of this game is small, but dedicated, and new faces can only make it better.In fact, myself and a few others often go out of our way to help teach rookies the basics, and try to pull them through the games steep learning curve (i'll get to that later) Learning the gameProbebly the biggest reason for many rookies not enjoying the game is the steep learning curve, which is only made more difficult recently, because a large majoraty of the playerbase are well experienced (especially AUS servers) and how crucial teamwork and listening to your team can be.Don't buy this game expecting to be able to go rambo-mode and ignore your team, you WILL die a LOT. oftentimes, rookies in their first 10 hours will get little to no kills each game, but DO NOT let that discourage you, if you can manage to get past the inital hardships, you will enjoy the game more and more, trust me.on a side note, to anyone wanting to learn how to play aliens more effectivly, i DO have some helpful material on my youtube channel here.  here GameplayThe gameplay of Ns2 is  incredibly deep and complex to the new player, the ""classes"" alone take a long time to master, and you will never be able to master them all, you will always be better at one type of weapon/lifeform than another.The gameplay is heavily focused on map control, and coordination between team members, if one team is too agressive, even if they are slaughtering the enemy team, one or two palyers destroying resource nodes in the unprotected side of the map can quicly turn the tide, but that requires quick reaction time, and coordination. A player does not need to be getting kills to be useful, they only need to be where the enemy isn't, hitting res nodes is very important, and if one team holds more than 4 nodes for too long the game can start to snowball and one side will gain late game teach early, and the only option may be a last ditch base rush or a concede vote.BackgroundI first started playing the game way back in Dec 2012 and have been playing it on and off since then, but it wasn't until i got an average computer setup in Jun 2014, thus being able to play with higher than 20fps...Then being invited into a competitive team, and learning the finer points of the game, and drasticly improving my own performance. recently? i've taken to recording Ns2 games (among other things) to my youtube channel as a kind of hobby, and i'm one of the few youtube channels still around doing so.

												Great but incredibly complex game with a steep learning curve. The game pits the technologically advanced marines against the highly adaptive aliens (similarly to Terran vs Zerg in StarCraft). Both teams have unique playstyles and strategies which gives way to very interesting asymmetrical gameplay. Both teams also have a single player who becomes the team's commander. The commander basically builds structures, invests in upgrades, and guides the team as a whole.The biggest problem with this game would probably be the mediocre tutorial, which coupled with the aforementioned steep learning curve will require quite some time to learn the game. However, there are a lot of helpful players that play the game along with many rookie-only servers to get started with.In short, this is a difficult game with a wonderous level of depth, strategy, and tactics.

												Let me start off by saying that at the time of this review being posted, there is an average of 4-5 active servers populated with a split of bittervets and rookies.Like everyone says, the learning curve is pretty harsh - I strongly suggest taking some time to run the tutorials and a couple offline games, to get acquuainted with the controls and mechanics of the game. Bots will be a poor introduction for teammates and opponents, but at least you'll know what buttons do what and what you should (generally) be doing, in a match.There is a decent selection of available toys to play with, in game (standard fare, generally, but ""all these oldies are goldies"")Rounds... Playing the game... here is where things fall apart.. ""People"".. - Someone needs to step up as Commander, which can take upwards of 5 minutes, as nobody wants to Comm and get yelled at for being a failcomm.. So unless you have nerves of steel or natural talent, best of luck if you want to try your hand at playing Commander.- Forfeiture. 1 in 5 rounds will end in a team-wide ragequit (usually because they don't like their Commander) as soon as the team loses any amount of ground. About %10 of these forfeitures will be the Commander recycling all of the team's structures.Load times are kind of long, but it offers one the opportunity to take a bio-break or whatever (make a snack, do your taxes, read War and Peace).. The long load times can become trying, when rounds have repeated fail-starts... But it is tollerable, in general.That said.. This game has been some of the most fun I have had with a multiplayer FPS. The Commander/RTS aspect of the game adds some really neat aspects to the game, such as organic objectives (more than just ""kill them before they kill you, a la Counter-Strike or ""Stand in a ring until it is blue"" like any point-capture game.. Not that I have anything against them, just that NS2 has added a new element that I prefer over the others)Do I suggest this game to others? If they are fans of FPS and RTS games, it will offer some unique gameplay experiences. While the game is tough to pick up, it is rather rewarding to learn and perform even marginally well.TL;DR - Game's not crap, community can be. Tough learning curve, but rewarding.			"

												I fell in love with Natural-Selection 1 when it first came out, played hundreds and hundreds of hours until finally, NS2 came out. The alpha and beta releases seemed interesting but you could barely play them because of the horrible performance. Thankfully, the game has been optimized since then and it runs decently these days (Obviously still not the best optimization when it comes to newer games.) That aside, it's one of the few games that successfully blends in RTS and FPS gameplay where you need a commander to build structures, order your field players around the map and eventually win the game. I've never fully enjoyed multiplayer games where you can go around solo and kill everything by yourself. Surely that's possible in NS2 as well if your opposing team doesn't know how to work together. Teamplay is the key word here, it basically forces you and your teammates to work together in order to win the game.I've bought this game so many times it's ridiculous. Pre-ordered it three times, bought several copies after the release and even got the humble bundle package a couple of times just so it could get more active players. Community is friendly and mods are keeping the game alive and kicking, whether you want different models or some UI tweaks, it's all available in the steam workshop. Overall, it's a multiplayer game where teamwork is absolutely required. Don't like that? Then the game is not for you. However, if that concept seems like it could keep you entertained, then don't hesitate to buy. Highly recommended!			"

												A very challenging game that mixes RTS and FPS into one (pretty good) multiplayer game. One player is the commander, who places buildings and drops supplies for his units, who are the other players. This game is very hard, so I would be ready to lose.Also, this game is very CPU instensive, so it will not perform well (or at all) on older PCs.			"

nukes-viewHi all, nukes here.Natural Selection 2 (NS2) is a multiplayer team orientated game. Like most stories there are two sides to each. (NS2) is just that, one side is the first person shooter and the other is the commanding side top down real time strategy, with real life units the best kind of unit.. right? More detail on this later.In (NS2) teams are pitted against each other humans (Elite Marine Frontiersmen) versus aliens (Kharaa) both teams battle it out over strategic resources, over a range of very different maps. Till there is only one team left able to fight.I found this game to be right up my alley loving the tactical aspects as well as the strategies. Please keep in mind a majority of the player base have played for well over 500+ hours and many of them have no patience for newcomers all though some are very welcoming and have time to teach.Bearing that in mind I'll delve deeper into why I personally think this is a great game.The Game PlayBefore you jump eagerly jump into the multiplayer servers, the game will urge you to play the tutorials (some servers will not let you join without completing the tutorials) and I can strongly recommend this as back in my day when I first started this game I never had the chance.The tutorials will cover all basic aspects of the game such as marines, aliens and commanding. This does not include skill, which my friend is up to you and a bit of practice. Also knowing a map goes a long way. I still get lost... like a lot.So before I mentioned that this game has two sides the FPS and the RTS Commanding side.First Person ShooterSo this one says it all if you join the marines you are given a rifle, handgun and a trusty axe. Enlisted to exterminate the aliens and protect the command centre.If you join the aliens you hatch into a four legged dog like creature, known as a skulk with a very nasty bite and the ability to climb on walls and ceilings your objective is to protect the hive and destroy the marines.Commanding - Real Time StrategyOn each team there is a slot for a commander. For newcomers I recommend getting use to the game before attempting this position, as the weight of the teams victory rests on your shoulders. There is no i in team but the commanders sole purpose is to command whether it be aliens or marines.This position takes on a different view, this is a top down or bird's eye view of the map where you oversee operations.You build, research technology, give your team members orders. Whether the follow orders it's up to them but depends how coordinated your team is.  Don't get me wrong some servers there is literally no team work. The servers that do revolve around team play and good commanders, are usually the ones where players have been playing for a long time. They are more than happy for new players to join so long as they are able to listen and work as a team. Although skill will set you apart at first, in no time you will learn. DifficultyThis game can be very difficult, lucky for new comers the first 5 levels of your personal character enable you to join rookie servers where only rookies are allowed to play. Once you have grown past level 5 unfortunately those servers are inaccessible to you. Meaning you have to join the big boys.Practice, practice, practice... or just die a lot like I did, gritting your teeth at every turn. Controls & InterfaceNS2 is a keyboard and mouse based game, if you are use to FPS games or RTS game the controls are relatively straight forward and easy to pick up.If you are not happy with the bindings you are able to change them in the options.AchievementsThe achievements on this game are fairly straight forward although there will be a few that are difficult to acquire.There are no achievements that have sapped the fun out of it for me.StoryThere is no unfolding story to this game unfortunately and there is no single player campaign mode.Although there is single player horde mode and tutorials. Combat System The combat is all real time so you had better check those corners before you run out into the open.You never know what maybe lurking in the dark above you.Hint: Marines - Burst fire or you will hear dead man's click too often.Aliens - Jump off the wall bite, bite. Jump off a wall bite, bite?Skills & TraitsThere is no skill and trait system, there is a personal level system that works off exp gained from playing online.Online players also have a Hive skill score which relates to how well you play globally.The aliens however work differently from the marines while in a match. You as an alien may evolve and select different traits based on which hive the commander has chosen. Multiple hives means multiple choices.As an alien you may evolve (at a cost) in to other roles that have similarities as support Gorge), assassin Fade, tank Onos and flying nuisance... the Lerk. Sounds  & EffectsSounds are relative to the game and can be adjusted nicely into the menus. I found all the sounds suit the environment and had no issues.GraphicsThe graphics are very pleasant, first time rending can take some time, but the game has been optimised greatly. Humour & TriviaEveryone loves a cute gorge right? Well its regarded in the community that the gorge is cute I don't see it myself but something to do with the ears?Also ""T"" to taunt in game.Game UtilitiesThe steam workshop is available for this game and NS2 has a good community that produce mods and maps. Many of the top servers have been heavily modded so first time loading may take some time, but mods such as NS2+ options are totally worth the weight. NS2+ means you can play around with your heads up display (HUD) look and also vision options for aliens and much more.MultiplayerThis game is orientated to multiplayer and the single play modes are really just the tutorials and horde mode.Although some servers are hosted with bot teams so you can practice and there is also arcade modes that will present different challenges.Bugs - ImportantI haven't come into any game breaking bugs myself.I would say one of the only draw backs is that some of the loads screens can take a while. Especially if you are joining a new server for the first time with added mods. As upon joining the mods will download for the first time.Patience is a virtue.ConclusionSo a lengthy review, that I hoped I covered all the bases . I personally enjoy this game on many different levels as I love RTS games and FPS although I am a terrible shot.This a good all round game for FPS and RTS lovers. If you like killing aliens or hiding in a corner stalking your prey, until the time is right to slice and dice then I hope you will enjoy this game as much as me.Sorry for such a long review, hope I helped.ηυĸєΜ266 "

												Love this game!  I'll give it an 8/10Suggestions:It is a real time strategy and first person shooter.  If you don't like the RTS part you don't have to command your team, just ask someone else too.  Make sure you listen to your commander if he even talks.  This game is very fun when you get to learn it.  The biggest problem for me was it has a pretty steep learning curve.  You will join a server (hopefully it will be a rookie friendly server) and have NO IDEA what to do, maybe even after you played the tutorial.  It took some time learning.  If you can find a siege mode server you should try that.  The flow of the game play will be more repetitive instead of people trying to do different strategies you don't understand.  You will die alot.  Your best bet would be to play as a supporting player and watching what other people do.  Grab yourself a welder as a marine or follow people around as a gorge.  You will be killed by a skulk almost EVERYTIME before you finally manage to get lucky or see them before they see you.  Yet when you play as a skulk you will probably get killed EVERYTIME until you at least get a few hours in.  The game could change in a heartbeat if you have a good commander on either team.  What I like to do?  Xenocide alot If you get an exosuit stay back and blast the alien scum from a distance, Don't be a heroDon't do things alone When someone wants to rush in or your commander says so make sure everyone is there before you doDon't ignore your resource nodesFor the love of god don't hop in the com chair when you don't know what you are doing.  You will be burned aliveIf people want to be jerks to you just ignore them or go someplace elseJoin a rookie friendly server.Make friends with the mods and adminsDon't say I don't know what to do (say what it is you need help with instead)			"

												This game came from a MOD that was very successful in the high times of HL1. It was that good that the inventor was able to found a company to craft NS2. For me its the best multiplayer ever and i havent changed my mind since 15 years now.You can find out if this game is after your fancy by affirming following questions:You like real competitive gameplay?You hate casual games where every softy gets his achievemet easily?You love awesome teamplay with intense communication that can turn every round, doesent matter how bad it was by now?You are bored of multiplayers with a red and a blue team that are completely balanced and unique so it doesent matter on which side you are?You like games that offer more than shooting at enemies?You like the idea of combining FPS with RTS?You like games that are driven and enhenced by the community itself. That arent force you to buy loads of addons and are being buried by the publisher when it starts to stagnate?Well if at least  2-3 questions passed, this game takes you only 10 bugs and i promise it will please you :)			"

												I've loved this game since early Natural Selection (flying around as a lerk picking up gorges, oh the good old days), this is a nice upgrade although the only downside is lack of players. Currently as of this writing there's about 500-600 max players which isn't terrible, but for a game of this caliber you would expect more. This game is beautiful and runs smooth, and is Linux compatible which is amazing.If you're considering buying this game, which it has gone on sale multiple times - just get it and checkout the tutorial. If you try and jump into it, it may be too much to comprehend at first and I want you to come back ;P so see how it works and give it a go. I feel like anyone can get into this, it has a nice strategy element with teamwork being a crucial element.There's nothing like jumping around chomping down on humans, or fighting off a swarm of aliens nibbling at your feet. This is the only game I'm aware of that fills this need, so please support it. They also make an awesome undersea survival game called Subnautica, also a great game that I recommend Unknown Worlds makes games they care for and you can tell with the constant updates years later.Thanks, I'll probably be updating this as more comes to me.

												WARNING, THIS GAME IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR NEW PLAYERS, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED...This game is has a fair few amount or bad things about it, which is why I could understand why you wouldn't reccomend this game to your friends. But I feel, as a person who does play some strategy and fps games, that this is a fair combination of the two. Reasons...Pros:Commander gameplay can be fun, especially with a good team.Teams seem to be balanced, even if some games do also seem to be one-sidedDoesnt have any pay-to-win ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or DLC that would seem unfairLooks very good no matter what view your seeing it fromVery good amount of teamwork is used in gamesCommunity is very nice, even with the bad applesVery good tutorialGame wants modsCons:People will concede if they seem to be losing even a little bitNo way to train with botsVisual options need more...

												Natural Selction 2 is a real standout in the FPS-Genre. The two factions play very differently from one another without feeling imbalanced (even though you will meet some players who say differently). Though there is a rather high learning curve, Natural Selection 2 is worth the frustration and failure you may experience at the beginning. Just visit the ""Rookie friendly servers"" and you will find many players who are willing to help you and explain certain mechanics that will lead to victory for you and your teammates. To me Natural Selection 2 isn’t great only because it’s very different from all the other  FPS's out there, but because it does asymmetrical multiplayer so damn well, offering up a variety of experiences in one small game.

												TL;DR: If Natural Selection 2 has ever interested you, don’t hesitate like I did!Had my eye on this game for over a year but was put off by negative reviews. Main concern was lack of a player-base, and that those that did play were hardcore vets who would rage at me for being new.The game was recently on free weekend, so figured why not.Turns out there is a healthy selection of servers, and plenty of rookie servers to play on. Game has a learning curve but after a couple games and some YouTube videos, playing as a marine grunt is easy (and FUN) enough. I’ve yet to try commander (even in the tutorial), and have barely touched the alien side, so having so much fun thus far with only about ¼ of the game’s content says a lot. I can easily see how people get a ton of hours out of this game, as there’s 4 unique ways to play it.Really blown away by the depth and required team work this game presents. Not only is it a fun shooter with unique asymmetrical game-play, but it also feels like an adventure horror game (as a marine, anyways). Venturing the eerily quiet ship with one or two other team-mates in itself is a thrill.As for the community, in my 5 and a half hours everyone has been very friendly and cooperative.			"

Posted: June 11, 2016
												Ahhh. NS2. The perfect combination of RTS and FPS. I have spent hours doing pretty much everything possible in this game, sans competative play. From shooting aliens to chomping marine scum, I have had the pleasure of playing NS2 for a while, through its low phase of small player count, and into what is now a fine time to purchase the game, as people are once again active and the servers are finally occupied. NS2 to a stranger hosts a team of marines, who play a standard (from a control standpoint) FPS game with a birds eye RTS commander, and a team of aliens with their own RTS commander. Both teams struggle to earn resources, both for the commander to place structures and assistance to players (tech, medpacks, etc), and for the players who need to buy weapons and stronger aliens. As the marine experience is more standard, and is not the most unique and in need of description part of this game, I will describe only the aliens in more depth to save you time reading this. The free one (the skulk) walks on walls, the others include a flying bat like creature with poison bites and spikes, a blade handed creature who can ""teleport"" short distances, a tubby hippo with healspray, and a giant gorilla rhino thing. The learning curve is steep for marines, steeper for aliens, and the steepest for commanders, but once past it, the game opens up into a unique, unforgettable experience. Here is what NS2 is to me though:-Crawling through an airvent as a marine and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ yourself when a cloaked skulk bites you and you spray and pray like nothing else.-Running away as a gorge from a marine that is pelting your behind and begging your teammates to save you.-That one guy who buys a flamethrower and everyone judges.-Beginners learning how to play as a higher alien lifeforms and thinking they are immortal (spoilers, they are not).-That marine who gets his exosuit for the first time, then screams ""I NEED WELDS"" when he loses 15 HP.-Commanders who care about their teams and strive to win, yet lose respectfully (most of the time).-A community that makes the stereotypical FPS community weep in jealousy...so many people who aren't pointlessly disrespectful and irritating.-Rookies (and people in general most of the time) who listen to advice, play hard and have fun. No matter what. In short, I 100% recommend this to anyone who enjoys strategy, FPS, and gaming with people who are mature (most of the time), intelligent team players, especially if in need of a unique twist or change of pace.I have come back here to say a few things that one should know about this game and what they should expect:-This game is about resources and should be treated as a strategy game. Although yes the FPS aspect is incredible and for the alien team unforgettable, but you will only win matches by keeping a close eye on enemy resources and tech. Do not be pursuaded into thinking otherwise.-There will be players better than you until you have experience. These players require strategy to work around, and sometimes it will be frustrating. Some players are simply god like but again, there are balance features and ways to work around one very high skilled enemy.-Communication is invaluable. You do not need a mic to play this game, but being able to hear other people's communication is crucial to hear tactics and create and excecute plans. Not to say that in all matches there is perfect teamwork, but if you pitch in and communicate with your team you will ALWAYS make a difference even if you don't think so. -Find a community, or even better, make one. Natural selection 2 is a team game, and the best way to use that to its best potential is to be a part of a community of regulars who all work together on a server(s). Knowing other players makes teamwork easier and you have the added bonus of knowing your opponents better. Balance also becomes more easy as regulars will generally be able to detect any possible errors in skill balance. Even a server full of rookies that are regulars can grow as players and enjoy such a beautiful game.-Finally, please be constructive. Avoid pushing players down, and instead tell them how to improve for next time. If a person is being a pain, ignore them or if needed mute them (from the scoreboard) so you can continue to work with other construcive players. In general people are nice, but there will always be a rotten one in the bunch that will try to ruin your day. I promise that they are not as common as they may seem, and can be worked around if you put just a small bit of effort in.			"

												While Natural Selection 2 is past its prime in terms of community and playerbase, the game is a beautiful example of 'early access' done right. In 2009, before early access existed on steam, Unknown Worlds began taking preorders for its new game. The game was one of dozens of sequels to Half Life 1 mods which might never come to fruition. As an avid fan of the first game, I preordered and followed its progress.When Unknown Worlds released their first beta build, I downloaded it and found that my laptop could only run the game with an FPS of about 1. More builds came and with the unveiling of their new 'Just-in time rendering' system the game was finally playable for me. Many more optimizations and fps improvements came over the years since NS2's official release.Between constant balance changes, rebuilding the entire alien tech tree, adding an auto-cyst placement system for the alien com, as well as gorge babblers, webs, rail exos, and 3 types of hand grenade, it was hard for a player not to appreciate the unparalleled level of post-lauch support that this game has enjoyed.In late 2013, Unknown Worlds created this video.

			Contribute: http://www.naturalselection2.com/reinforced/ Reinforced Trailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZzW23gAtyY		

In the video, the creators appealled to their playerbase on the basis that donations will allow the team to continue on NS2 longer before moving to a new project and also the cosmetics that they will recieve in return for a donation. Many outside the NS playerbase were incensed by this, seeing the move as a quick moneygrab. Three years later, Unknown Worlds have lived up to their words, continuing to expand and bug-fix the game where necessary, their most recent update releasing only six days ago at the time of this writing.So go on. Scroll up and watch one of the trailers, and if it appeals to you, click below to look at the playercount. Its a beautiful game made by a dedicated studio. The learning curve is brutal, but its gameplay can't be matched. http://steamcharts.com/app/4920 "

												A great competitive FPS, unfortunately ruined due to in my opinion launching too early. Of course it 'had to be launched for financial reasons' and I love the developers but I really wish they had an extra few years to flesh it out and then do the release. The main issues being performance, lack of in-depth or interactive tutorial, and a real way to have a form of player made matching which is for sure the new standard in all forms of video games, especially competitive video games.A lot of the negative reviews and feedback came from the games launch and thus I think really hurt the playerbase, and new potential players. The game didn't really come with an in-depth tutorial for this generations of 'everything in front of me, learn nothing' demographic of gamers. These new gamers also do not like to be demolished by veterans and learn from their mistakes, instead they blame things on cheats or simply complain and then remove the game from their library's and continue back with something more casual.The developers were very active in the forum and with updating even to this date. The community is great and really keeps the game alive and thriving. In its current state I for sure recommend you try it out if you like competitive fps what so ever. But don't always expect to find a server with your preferences as there isn't too many running. Especially if you like small player counts and not an excess of mods.As for the developers they continually work on other projects and I recommend you follow them and their products if you value your pc games. They keep a great community and really take into account player feedback.. it's pretty much your duty as a gamer to support developers such as this to keep the pc community thriving.. or else you'll end up with some multi-million dollar recycle every year that your three year old brother could play on a high level.I love this game, its community as I said before, and the developers. I give it a solid 9 out of 10.			"

												I really liked NS1 and enjoy NS2 even more. Admittedly the learning curve is very steep, but once you get into it it's really addicting. Contrary to other reviewers here I had only positive experiences with the Natural Selection Community. Generally everyone is very nice to each other because good team play in Natural Selection is even more important than in CS or TF2. There aren't as many servers as there used to be but it's still no problem to find active games with enough players. The game is 4 years old but the graphics still look awesome and the overall design is just timeless. If you are a casual player and just want an easy game you will be frustrated. But if you are tough enough and enjoy a good challenge you will have lots of fun.			"

												Do you like shooters? What about dreams of being a space marine or vicious alien. If you liked games like Starcraft, Counterstrike or Left 4 dead, you will love this game. To help you get started I've been creating a video series to help you become a pro right out the air lock.

												The game is a mix of a First Person Shooter and RTS (of sorts), but in a good way. The teams consist of a single commander on both sides that will build structures whilst also, taking advatage of his top down perspective, trying to instruct and organize his Ground Troops. Of course the playstyle is diffrent depending on which team for the marine commander needs the Ground Troops to build the structures he placed whilsed the alien commander doesn't need his Ground Troops to do so. The objective is to take out all of the opposing team's Command Stations (Marine) or Hives (Alien).   Because there is only a single commander per team you will likely be spending a large majority of yoru time being  apart of your team's Ground Troops. -As the Marine Ground Troops you will have to communicate with your team to build structures set down by your commander and try to not be killed by the Aliens by trying to engage them at a distance. -As the Alien Ground Troops you will try to slow and prevent Marine progression and explansion by destroying Marine Structures and killing them yourself. The Marines have Machine guns that are very effective at killing Aliens at range, and as the Alien you do not have range a large majority of the time. This leads to creative ways to try and get to them, from Crawling into the vents to try and flank them to crawling on the walls to ambush them. *Keep in Mind that the things I just described are the very basics of both sides and the game has much more to it.Something really nice about the game I would like to note is that there are rookie servers that only new players can join where you can only play with other players that are also realitivly new to the game. So you will never really have this pressure in these servers. Yet when you start feeling comfotable enough to start playing on normal servers you will find many servers will have vey organized teams that create amazing games! It's a very nice system having freindly rookie servers and amazingly organized normal servers.The only issue I have with this game is trying to practice with commander. When I started becoming proficient with playing commander (online) I was locked out of the rookie servers. Normally this would be a good thing as the game deemed me with enough expirience to start playing on normal servers. Now in these servers you play with a large amount of veteran players, and this left me very little room to practice playing commander. Of course I'm not saying it's impossible to play commander because every once in a while you with find a team with no commander that is very supportive of you being a new commander and will help you do so. But most of the time on the normal severs I was contemplating either: ""A. Taking command and being inexperienced and slower and more than likely lose the game for our team because of this."" or ""B. Letting someone else take command that is faster and more expirienced whilst  be part of the Ground forces where I have the most experience in playing."" Either Way I find this game to be overall fantastic and a lot of fun to play. I would recomend this game to anyone who enjoys playing with orginized teams to create amazing strategies and extensive engagments.			"

												Natural Selection 2: My Addiction, My AppreciationI've obsessively been playing Natural Selection 2 for the past couple of months now. After previously writing about not liking the online part of MMO's I've decided to write about one where it's essential and largely why I'm hooked. So what is NS2?Natural Selection 2 is a first person shooter (FPS) with real time strategy (RTS) elements. There are two teams, marines and aliens and the goal is to eliminate the enemies base (or bases). In each map you begin with a standard base and someone on each team elects to be a ""commander"". This commander plays the role of the RTS player and everyone else are the units who fight. Each map there are resource points you need to capture and gain more map control.Team work in this game is key, without it you lose. It's a simple rule.You have work as a whole team and as individual groups. Covering each other, helping build buildings and protecting them, listening to commands and constantly moving forward trying to secure more ground. If you venture out yourself you're most likely going to die unless you have superb aim, even then a well executed attack by a couple of enemies and even your aim won't save you. Because of this, a losing team could come back from the brink.I've played games where the whole map is lost to us and we have only our little base to camp in and through some amazing team work, quick thinking and some luck have turned the tables completely and I've had the same happen to me while on the winning team. That thrill of coming back or the shock horror of all of a sudden be losing is exhilarating. A game is almost never set in stone makes you play smart, always be on your guard and expect anything. To me this is rare in most games. This game relies on a lot of components to gain a win (a good commander, good players, map control, constant awareness, resources, etc.) that it's hard to have the upper hand on all of those which means by the virtue of so many facets, that it's usually a more balanced competition. On the other hand, with so much to juggle it's easy to be overwhelmed.This is the one thing I appreciate most of all from this game, the friendly community. It can take some time to understand how the game works and even longer to get good at it. I've seen many a player in a server with everything thinking ""what the hell is that guy doing?"" and for them to say ""sorry guys, I'm new"". In my experience in other games I've seen the person either be told off or ignored, in NS2 the majority of people have actually instead helped. They tell them what they're doing wrong, how to do it right and things to be aware of in between. This even happens with people new to commanding (with out a decent commander you are almost bound to lose) and people teaching them and being supportive throughout it all. It honestly makes me truly happy inside to see this considering where the community stands today.The gaming community can be a horrendous pit filled with anger and childish behavior that seems to be endless. This is where most of me grew up, gaming is something I love and I know most in this community out there feel the same way and it hurts to see the vocal minority who have nothing but vitriol to spit being the larger voice to represent us all. There is some of this in NS2 but there is much more kindness to balance it out.NS 2 is a small community compared to other games and maybe that's what guides it down a gentler path. There are not many of us so the more we push away the less of a chance the game we enjoy will stick around. So we try not be an♥♥♥♥♥and instead help to guide these and hopefully they'll do the same in time. That's something I can be proud to be part of.With a high challenge, the to and fro of games and an awesome community filled with decent human beings I can't help but to constantly jump back in to a game when ever I have free time.

												Some games are easy to pick up and play. Others require you to learn, improving and developing skills as you go. The multiplayer-only Natural Selection 2 proudly sits in the latter camp. The latter camp isn't for everyone, and that's okay. But as long as a game is designed well enough to allow you to learn, improve and develop, it's always great to see one push the envelope and not rely on the most tried-and-tested formulas. Often, these games end up being some of the most refreshing, the most celebrated titles around. Natural Selection 2 is one such game. It isn't the most accessible game on the market, but if you put in the time, this deep and complex strategy/shooter hybrid rewards you with plenty of engaging variety and lots of thrills.It's important to stress from the outset: if you're a first-time player, your initial enjoyment of Natural Selection 2 will be entirely decided by how prepared you are to learn new gameplay systems. There's no interactive tutorial; all the game offers is a series of lengthy demo videos. These aren't ideal, they don't open within the game interface, and it's a lot to take in should you choose to watch them all back to back before diving in. That said, by far your best bet in picking up Natural Selection 2 is to play Natural Selection 2. The way the game is structured makes it very easy to learn by doing. Certain servers (highlighted in green) are defined as rookie servers, providing a great place to get to grips with the game's many systems, ideally under the watchful eye of a more experienced commander.The commander's role forms the RTS portion of the experience. Here, one player controls resource management, base building, and upgrades. The commander directs units, issues orders, and tells the team where to go and what to do. The best rounds of Natural Selection 2 see the commander using full voice chat, communicating with the team vocally as well as through the interface. A good commander isn't the only thing that can make NS2 appealing, but having a competent leader goes a long way towards making the game more enjoyable.Thankfully, it's usually easy to find plenty of welcoming, communicative matches; after all, NS2 is very much a team game. There's absolutely no incentive to ostracize or punish teammates for a poor performance. The best commanders know that to win, communicating with and nurturing your team is key. The best way to learn how to play commander is by not playing commander. Take a hands-off approach, stick to one of the ground troops, and it's very easy to pick up what makes for a successful--and unsuccessful--commander. On top of that there's Explore mode, which lets you play around in the RTS interface with a vast amount of resources, and tool tips for each structure. A lone skulk, waiting to pounce. Clearly, it's been watching Alien.A lone skulk, waiting to pounce. Clearly, it's been watching Alien.The commander is just one role, however, and the rest of the players have a diverse array of options to choose from. There's a lot here, and chances are, after a bit of experimentation, you'll find at least one aspect of the game you really click with. The best way to approach the game isn't to think of it as having an overall learning curve, but a number of smaller spikes; focus on one aspect of the game, and you'll learn plenty by way of observation while doing so. Thankfully, the game's been designed exceptionally well to allow this. Every facet of both the Frontiersmen (marines) and Kharaa (alien) sides is important. It's very much like Team Fortress in that respect: every role has its place and purpose.The roles themselves vary considerably depending on which side you're on. The Frontiersmen are the more traditional of the two; rather than focusing on individual classes, weapon and equipment upgrades allow you to outfit your character depending on your playing style and the demands of the situation. Through the commander's resource management, new weapons are made available, including shotguns, flamethrowers, grenade launchers, and mines. Then there's the prototype lab, allowing the research and purchase of jetpacks and exos (think the loader from Aliens, but with the ability to punch and shoot). On top of that there are numerous other research possibilities. There's the arms lab that provides permanent armor and weapon buffs as long as the lab remains active, a robotics factory that allows for the creation of commander-controlled support units, and various individual objects such as teleports, enemy detectors, and sentry guns.Of course, nothing comes for free, and all these goodies can only be bought with resources. For both teams, resources take the form of team resources and personal resources. Team resources are used exclusively by the commander to build, upgrade, and generally get things done. Personal resources are used to buy the items on the ground. Both types of resource are generated based on the number of collection structures your team has put in place (extractors for marines, harvesters for aliens).Explore mode lets you test out the commander role without sending your team to their doom.It's unlikely your team will be able to afford every single bit of kit, so you have to choose your purchases carefully, and this adds a layer of strategy to all aspects of the game. A good commander will have a game plan, focusing on specific research and development to shape the team into a suitable side. Fancy building up a ton of defenses and sending a strike team to meet your opponent? Or perhaps aggressively expanding your base across the map, choking the opposing team and cutting off their potential resources?The Kharaa side, on the other hand, is a lot more focused on class-based progress. There are five alien types, with the skulk leading the way as the basic, free unit, and the rest requiring increasingly more personal resources to evolve into. You have the gorges, almost-cute hippo-like creatures that act as healing/support classes, who can also build hydras (sentries) and clogs (defensive walls). They can also powerslide around on their bellies. Then there are the lerks: flying units who specialize in precision strikes and utilize poison to get at their foes. Next up is the fade, the stealth specialist that excels in speed and rapid damage.Kharaa vs. Frontiersmen: Whoever wins, we lose (unless we're on the winning team).Kharaa vs. Frontiersmen: Whoever wins, we lose (unless we're on the winning team).Finally there's the most expensive unit, the onos, a huge rhino/gorilla-like creature with vast amounts of health and armor, capable of rampaging through even the most well-defended marine base. The onos is perhaps overpowered right now, and can often turn the tide of a match in a way that can occasionally feel cheap, although watching a team of skilled marine players rapidly take down an army of four onos is a moment of beauty. (Unless you're on the alien team, of course. Then it's the stuff of nightmares).Natural Selection 2 isn't without its problems, however. For starters, despite the fact they're large and well-designed, there are only six maps, although between free updates from developer Unknown Worlds Entertainment and community-designed maps, there's potential for expansion here. Then there's the barrier for entry; there's no denying that when faced with a genre mash-up comprised of a bunch of classes and no hands-on tutorial, some players are going to be put off before they get started.

												It's an RTS where the marines try to contain the aliens, although the commander of each team only has control of the structures and upgrades, because each unit is controlled by a player.Pros: There is a lot of depth. High replay value. 10v10 games where your actions matter. High skill cap.Cons: Large learning curve. A lack of teamwork can cause frustration. Excessive or negative chat can throw a match. Relatively small community. People with aim bot like skill can imbalance the game. "

												This game is definitely worth it and its usually on sale. There are 2 playable factions -humans and aliens and each have their own special units and abilities. The amazing thing about this game is that its very teamwork intensive. Each team gets 1 commander who pretty much gets an overhead view of the battlefield and instructs teammates on what to do/build. The game is pretty easy for humans but for aliens its a big learning curve. If you do get the game do not play commander without reading a guide/tutorial because it can be extremely difficult. The combat is very fun and you can do all types of strategies and builds each game, such as fast expand for aliens to get xenomorph or human fast expand with warp gate tech or harassing human extractors with skulks with aliens which is one of the best ways to get yourself back into the game as aliens.All in all 9/10 Very good game I would recommend.

												Got this game when it came out... it wasnt good back then and had loads of issues. Now however the game seems to have sorted out all the major and minor issues. The game is fun now and still looks good. There are still people playing with between 1-4 full servers every time I have logged on. Updates are still comming out. Decent amount of Commanders using ingame VOIP and better offline training stuff for new players to learn the game. Only negatives are that the fun is dependent on balanced teams and a decent RTS commander. Which isnt a given each match, but there are more than you would think. Balance wise the game seems okay, wouldnt call myself that qualified to judge, but maybe Onos (Alien tanks) are slightly OP mid game if the Marines have lagged slightly behind.			"

												This is an amazing game, don't get me wrong. Its pure awesome, its experimental, its fun and its complex. Saying that however, I would not recommend this game. Its an assymetrical alien vs human game with a mix of RTS thrown in, this is a team game, a very awesome teamgame, you won't find a generic shooter here.However Tthe playerbase declined severly many years back, and it wasn't its complexity or difficulty that killed it, not even close. It was the games performance and optimization. I haven't played this game in a long time, but it ran terribly, I know this has been largely fixed but this was an issue that plagued this game for FAR too long. I believe thats what killed the game, waiting for a few minutes to load into a match made the game infuriating for to play, it simply made people less eager to play it, thats why i stopped and thats why many of the people i played with, stopped. If you want to play this game check which servers have active players on the forums, I live in SA and its not possible for me to play without 300+ ping, so if you live in asia, africa, australia, south america or basically anywhere other than the EU and america, there are probably no active servers.This is an AMAZING game, but the solutions were too little, too late. This game needed some sort of massive promotion to renew interest, but now its simply faded to irrelevance. The devs moved on as well, they moved on to subnautica.So no, do not buy this game unless you know there are servers where you live, either wise you'd be buying a multiplayer game with nobody to play with.

												Despite it's age, NS2 looks very nice and runs beautifully, which wasn't always the case. The game is definitely the most stable it has ever been, in terms of performance.Despite showing some age, and having a pretty ancient netcode which results in many ""round the corner"" type deaths, NS2 is still a very enjoyable experience and a great game to fill up a night or two.However, the community has problems. First off, the game is dead. NS2 will host an average of 250 players daily, if it's lucky. This means you'll be playing the same people, which can be a good or bad thing depending on how good you are at the game, and your standing with everyone. Be friendly and try not to alienate anyone because of this, as you'll probably only have 2-3 servers at most to choose from. If you get banned from them, or make people hate you, you will literally be screwed out of playing this game ever again.If you are looking to pick this game up to play with friends, I sadly recomended that you reconsider. Once you and your friends reach level 5, and you are no longer able to play on the few 'Rookie Servers', you'll be pingeonholed into one of the two servers remaining - where everyone votes for ""skill based teams"" that will result in you being placed on the opposite teams than your friends.You'll go from having fun playing with your buddies on the team you want to play on - to having the game constantly dictate itself to you with it's constant restrictions and lack of care for your playstyle. You like playing aliens? Chances are you'll be forced marines more often that not and you'll have to sit through rounds of drudgery just to play what you wanted in the first place. By then, you won't even care.			"

It combines RTS with FPS so you can play however you like (although you got to get to the commandstation/hive first if you want the RTS feel.RTS: set battleplans, give orders, and manage the players on the field. Making poor choices can screw you up but if you are a good commander your sure to win the game. (Victory cannot be achived by FPS alone.)FPS: Get upgrades, build, fortify, and all-out kick some alien/marine♥♥♥♥♥ Tons of weapons/classes you can select and staying with the group is always the best option in this game.Happy hunting!

												Natural Selection 2 is an independent (indie) crowdfunded multiplayer game from before the time of game crowdfunding at kickstarter.It is based on the the most played, non-commercial, Half-Life mod Natural Selection, which is a masterpiece!The two key features of NS are:1. Asymmetric teams!The aliens have several completely different, specialised classes, all of whom mainly rely on melee combat. To their aid the aliens have a wide variety of movement abilities and possibilities.The marines play like a regular FPS and are defined by their equipment.2. The game is at the same time an RTS!One player on each team takes the role of commander with all the traditional RTS elements, as top-down view of the map together with building placement, technology research, expansion and resource collection - from resource points spread out on the map which need to be controlled!As much as I can talk about the incredible depth of gameplay of NS1, this standalone sequel has gone a slightly different path, mostly for the worse. Nevertheless, this is one of the very few unique games out there with very deep and entertaining gameplay!For people who want to challenge the best, there is a big and very welcoming competitive/pro community!On the whole, NS2 (and NS1! requires HL1) is absolutely recommended to anyone who likes multiplayer first person shooters and wants something MUCH more than soldier vs soldier deathmatch!Practical considerations:1. Having a microphone is a big plus as a soldier and a lack thereof is a big minus when being commander.2. You need a good gaming computer to play this game enjoyably. The developer Unknown Worlds is continuously working on improving performance.Of the current generation, a midrange Haswell gaming CPU together with a midrange AMD 200-series or nVidia 700-series GPU.Of the previous generation, a midrange Ivy-Bridge gaming CPU together with a midrange AMD 7000-series or nVidia 600-series GPU.Of the next-previous generation, a top range Sandy-Bridge gaming CPU together with a  top range AMD 6000-series or nVidia 500-series GPU.

												THIS GAME SHOWS BRUTAL WHY TEAMWORK IS ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME.Game:  2 teams  -  aliens / mariens               are fighting for ressource points, controll over the map and             the final goal to destroy the mainbase of the other team to win the game.Marienside:Its great for fast fps player that like to avoid an attack by jumping back or strafe to left in the moment a alien is approching.Weapons for close combat and Weapons for long range combat every weapon is different and can be used in his own way. Moste times you dont want to go allone with a flamethrower because the single target dmg is not so high and you could easy be killed by lowlifeforms aliens.ALienSide:As a basic alien (you spawn like that called ""skulk"") you can walk on walls and use every conor ,dark room to hide and supprise the enemys from behind. Take care  to avoid big groups of rines try to sepperate one  or just go for the last one in line.Like the weapons on marienside, every alien player can evolve into other sorts of aliens.Some are flying, some are bigass tanks and some are dmg dealer that cant take much dmg but are fast as hell and bad to aim at.One bad thing i have to tell you all.The Devs try to ♥♥♥♥ up a big part of the community by making them non hive server.What? you asking . They disconnect  the servers they dont like from the STATS DATABASE they own.			"

												LE SIGH. Sloppy, permanently unfinished, no player base, hostile community, doesn't even know the meaning of the word ""optimization"" because it runs like dog doo, and has tons of bad gameplay mechanics needlessly invented since the first game. Sad I paid money for this, but I was there for original NS beta 1.0 and since around 1.3 or something it has been one epic slide downhill that they managed to somehow continue with a brand new game, against my expectations. Natural Selection II is why I stopped buying new games and crowdfunding unknown games. This was a known game, an easy victory, and it still failed.edit: I wrote this a long time ago and only just made the review public, but it's even more true in 2015. NS2 sadly went the way of NS1 -- Started promising, huge potential, but flamed out quickly because the development of the game pandered to an ultra toxic elitist community of total losers. Sad, sad, sad.			"

												I loved this game. But it's dead now. Truly dead.These late gameplay reworks and balance changes are just haphazard attempts to eek out a few more months of life.At least the rookie servers seem to have populations. I wouldn't know. The fact that there is more life on segregated servers for rooks than vet servers keeps it that way.The story might be different if you're EU or NA.But if you're an Aus/NZ player you are well and truly screwed.Essentially you either play on the one or two non rookie servers that give you 250+ms but don't auto kick high pings -while still being chewed out for a high ping- or you luck out for the 2-3 hours of one night a week where the Aus server sees more than 10 concurrent players.This game was fantastic. Rest in Peace, GG No Re.			"

												So i bought this game like a year ago and i played 10 hours over the course of a few weeks before deciding it just wasnt fun. Yesterday i decided to reinstall and give it another shot. After taking a few hours to get to grips with the mechanics and feel of the game i was totally hooked. Been playing solidly ever since.I was kind of worried that upon leaving the rookie servers everything would just feel cheap like in chivalry and id lose interest, but the exact opposite happened. Everyone works together really well and victorys feel hard fought and satisfying. Everytime i died it felt fair, and the large variety of weapons and playstyles avaiable in marines alone lends a ton of replayability.Its just so satisfying suiting up in a jetpack and having your manouverability increase  by like 500 percent. Zipping around like an angel of death blasting away with a machinegun or getting up close and dirty with a shotgun. Or if the situation calls for it whip out a flamethrower or grenade launcher. Maybe just dedicate yourself to accompanying the players decked out in giant mech suits repairing them on the go, while you save up for your own giant mech suit.This game is just insanely fun and the community isnt nearly as bad as some of the reviews here make it out to be. So far i havnt seen anyone get kicked let alone unfairy and the people using voice chat are fairly relaxed and possesing great teamwork. Theres always 2-3 full servers and at least one full rookie server. Maps are well designed and have decent if not overwhelming variety.I can easily see myself playing hundreds of hours of this game over the next few months, if this game cost 20 euro id say it was fair. For 10 euro its a freakin steal.			"

												Fantastic game blending FPS and RTS.  Not only that, but the teams use asymmetric tactics yet are pretty equal in their strengths.Marines focus on long-range combat and require a tighter degree of teamwork than the alien team.  This allows a team which works together well and have goal-oriented players to do far better than a team whose players focus on trivial things like KDRs or use disharmonous tactics.  Teamwork also allows Marines to effectively utilize powerful late-game tech like exo-suits which require support marines to repair them as well as concentrating the firepower needed to take down the Onos or Fades.The Aliens focus primarily upon melee combat, though there are exceptions.  Aliens can operate a little more independently than Marines in the later stages of the round when higher lifeforms like Fades and Lurks.  Onos usually require a gorge to heal them or a commander prescient enough to build forward bases and a team to defend them. The Marine commander is a bit more challenging than the Alien commander, too, due to the amount of micro-managing of support, but this also allows the commander to be quite a bit more effective than the Alien commander as the Marine commander does not need to build structures in order to heal Marines or resupply their ammo.  This is powerful early game, but forward bases are still recommended mid-late game.Overall, many, many hours of fun to be had with this game.  The only recommendation is doing some training before taking the commander's chair.			"

												This game has the worst comminuty out there, you'll get scolded for being new to the game, not to mention it's long learing curve.  Poeple constantly stack teams and most games don't get past the 10 minute mark.  You have to constantly bunny hop even as a marine, the mechanics of this game is horrible.  Also seems like a number of poeple are starting to use some sort of NoReg and the number of people doing this is climbing ( I personally blame the horrid mechhaics of the game for this ). Then you get people who never miss a shot on an alien no matter the situation any type of manuvering or avoiding or anything these people will still never miss, also these same people always play Marine, Humm I wonder why ?Save yourself the time, money and headaches.  In its current state it's a huge no no to anyone new or old.			"

Basically, it's a work simulator. Work for victory, otherwise get yelled at by your drill-sergeat/commander for not being MLG.			"

Posted: August 28, 2015
												Symmetry is sexy… or so we’re told. We’ve been conditioned by eons of evolutionary pressure to equate a simple formula: symmetry=beauty. Our primate brains are built for symmetry, since a significant portion of our grey matter is dedicated to the detection of it. We can discern within fractions of a second whether an object is symmetrical or not. This has profound effects on civilization. Generally speaking, people with highly symmetrical faces have more self-confidence, get hired more easily, are judged by workplace superiors to be more productive and intelligent, get more promotions, make more money, get more… well, you get the picture.   And what does this teach us about ourselves? That we’re a society of shallow sycophants? Yes, but it also teaches us that we are hardwired symmetry seekers; that we can’t help but be blindly drawn to symmetry like moths to the electric bug zapper. *Pop*. Fortunately, us gamers have learned to subdue our symmetry seeking boner missiles, probably due to prolific internet pornography fappery; okay maybe not due to that, but whatever the cause, we’ve learned the hard lesson that perfect symmetry in videogames is boring.    Thus, most competitive multiplayer games have at least a little bit of asymmetry. The devs add just enough differences to the teams to produce faction flavoring, or they place the teams in asymmetric roles (i.e. assaulter vs defender, King of the Hill). All of this is just dandy, and we like to call it “gameplay depth”. However, treading too far down the wrong fork in Asymmetry Lane can lead to the developmental shantytown known as Balance Patch City: a dark domain in the midst of a constant process of buffing and nerfing that can leave the local player community distraught and burnt out, a community who’ve in turn been reduced a collective of fetal positioned, thumb sucking man-children babbling random strings of capital letter text that include phrases like “GAME=BROKEN”, “NERFPOCALYPSE”, or (Christian Bale’s favorite) “WHAT DON’T YOU ♥♥♥♥ING UNDERSTAND!?”  Thankfully, Unknown Worlds Entertainment has utilized their excellent navigation skills and have expertly trodden the full length of Asymmetry Lane. Aye, they’ve fought through the mines of Moria, passed the silvery towers Gondor, simply walked into Mordor, scaled Mount Doom where they threw a sheet of papyrus scribed with the word “symmetry” into the fires at the heart of the earth (a purely symbolic gesture, of course), and rode a disfigured gryphon all the way to Asymmetry Heaven. The end result of this epic journey? Natural Selection 2.  NS2 smashes head-on two opposing forces featuring polar opposite combat doctrines with an effect more dazzling than the quark-gluon plasma spewing forth from the Large Hadron Collider. Scientists are still baffled by its success. Within this game you will take on the role of the Frontiersman, a Trans-System Federation grunt in a future where a space-faring civilization has taken a little time away from mudane tasks like warping space-time and building Dyson's Spheres to produce something so incredible that it is rarely seen in Science Fiction: a recoilless assault rifle. Mind blowing right? What will you do with this deadly accurate weapon? Like any good Space-American, you’ll use it to shoot anything that moves during an extra-terrestrial first contact scenario of course! We wouldn't want such a relationship to get off on the wrong foot after all, so you’ll be using your stand-off ranged capabilities to create interlocking fields of fire while taking solace in the knowledge that the word ""questions"" was removed from the dictionary three centuries ago. Watch those corners, watch those corners!  Alternately, you’ll be playing as the Kharaa, a misunderstood biomass collective of intelligent bacteria that can morph into higher lifeforms. Since you hate being roasted by the wanton use of flamethrowers, you’ll be using your biomass to morph into savage creatures with hardened carapaces, regenerating flesh, and poison gas for flatulence. No, not the Addams Family. Your cast of characters will include such melee-expert heavyweights as Skulk Hogan, Lerk Skywalker, Gorge Foreman, Walker - Texas Fade, and the dreadfully hideous Yoko Onos. You’re built for the ambush, so dark corners and high speed maneuvers augment your offensive capabilities.  NS2 takes this first-person asymmetry gaming perfection and kicks it up a notch Emeril Lagasse style. You take ¾ cups of FPS and throw in ¼ cups of RTS and BAM! You’ve got a full cup of “omg I can’t believe this actually works, what sorcery have you conjured to mix oil and water!?” hearty gaming goodness. That’s right boys and girls, one of you maggots (term used figuratively if you’re a Frontiersman, but very, very literally if you’re an incubating Kharaa xenomorph) is going rise to the call and transcend your mere 1st person existence to actually take semi-omniscient command of this needless bloodbath. The rest of you… well, you get to play your favorite units from Starcraft; that’s right, the indomitable SCV and the expendable Zergling. So grab yourself a welding tool Jonny Rico and go build my resource extractors! (Welding just not cutting it for you? Worry not because the Mutalisk, Ultralisk, Goliath, and Firebat also make faithful but legally distinct appearances in this title.)  As the commander you have access to the full suite of typical RTS institutions. There's the top down view, resource management, tech trees, upgrades, deployables, the left click, and the all important right click. You'll have your hands full trying to wrangle the units at your disposal. Only now instead of your units following your orders with unconditional obedience, you'll have to guide them through the delicate process of helping them arrive at the conclusion that, yes, sacrificing themselves in a suicide assault is good for them. Look, ""Offensive Pattern Picard Distraction Phallus 8-D"" is good for you because it's good for the team. Oh you get it now? Good for you... now run along and die like a good little Redshirt. Kay thanks.  Fortunately for new recruits, there are players who've played 2000 hours of NS2 and can teach less experienced competitors superior movement skills, map awareness, and gameplay knowledge.  Unfortunately for new recruits, there are players who've played 2000 hours of NS2 and will stomp less experienced competition with superior movement skills, map awareness, and gameplay knowledge. Whoa, déjà vu. The point of that ""it's a good thing/it's a bad thing"" dichotomy was to highlight the fact that NS2, like almost all other games, has a learning curve. This one is fairly steep, so as a new player prepare to be overwhelmed. However, please unbind your Ragequit button and stick this one out; you need to keep in mind that you've entered a digital world that has never before been executed so flawlessly. No, not even the beloved Battlezone from '98 managed to mix FPS and RTS with this level of finesse (although, if you're looking for an excellent singleplayer version of this experience, that classic gem is a must play for you). You are now treading in uncharted territory never before probed by the gaming populace. With a little patience you too can navigate your way to enjoyable and memorable gameplay experiences.  My advice to new players: stick close to the guy with the shotgun. Unless your a Skulk, then run, run away from the gun with the shotgun! No! Don't stop to look behind you, HES RIGHT THERE! KEEP MOVING YOU IDIOT! The bottomline: if you haven't lived vicariously as an ankle-biting, wall-climbing zergling... then you haven't lived at all. Play this mother♥♥♥♥ing beast of a game!			"

												The twitchy gun play is off putting at first in NS2, but you soon get used to it. This game is very team based, and it's the best feeling when your team finally just clicks. Sadly though, a bad team can ruin the game play experience completely.  One player is given the role as 'commander', this play will play the game in an RTS view, giving out orders, building structures etc, the rest of the team will play in FPS mode.There is plenty of different weapons for the Marines, where as the Aliens transform into different creatures, ranging from a scuttling little dog like alien, to a giant rhino beast.The levels are perfect arena, the lighting and ambient effects make it feel even more realistic. The top notch graphics and a really good engine, Spark.Load times are absolutely terrible. Logging into a server took me five minutes each time. This is reported across the board. Apart from this, I had no technical problems. Zero lag in game, which is must given the twitchy gun-play mechanics. I really enjoyed this game, but one that has to be played on mic and with a team of people you know.			"

												The best multiplayer FPS experience that no one is talking about. Runs flawlessly on Windows or Linux, tested on Windows 7/8 and Ubuntu Linux 13.10. Natural Selection 2 is not your average Call of Duty or Battlefield game, and that's a good thing -- because different is good. You can play as either the humans or the aliens, and the aliens have some very unique gameplay, including flying and crawling on walls/ceilings. The team leader sees the game from an RTS-perspective, while everyone else plays the game from a first-person shooter perspective. You cannot win the day by charging off by yourself with guns blazing; teamwork and communication are essential. You develop your base of operations, and then you and your teammates can have access to more powerful equipment or alien species. Aliens can get large, mammoth-like beasts, while humans can get access to weaponized mechs. Team strategies will win the day in the end, so communicate well and follow the lead of others until you know what you're doing. As a new player, I had no problems getting into the game and feeling welcomed. I was never criticized or judged, though I can't guarantee your experience.			"

												Take command if you're a strategist or fight as a ground solider. Teams have there own strengths and weaknessess. You need real teamwork in order to win. Seriously. If your leader sucks everyone sucks. If your soliders suck, the leader is boned. Play together, win together. I love this game. I only played so little because i suck XD.			"

												This game is by far one of the best games I ever played. Sadly there are not many players for this game and as a newbie it is very hard to get into it but there are many of the ""old"" players willing to guide you.This game is based on strategic gameplay and communication. If you have a good commander but the rest of the team is not willing to communicate you loose and vice versa.This game is about teamplay!			"

												A multiplayer experience that can be difficult, but extremely rewarding. My favorite thing to do is become a gorge and build stuff for the commander and defend/heal my teammates. It's rewarding to use in-game voice, and the community is a step above other gaming communities, rivaled only by EVE in my view.It's easy to pick up, easy to put down. The rounds can be insanely intense and enjoyable and is pure ecstasy when you're doing well. It could seem like it's the final moments for your team, and then a few people make good decisions and plays and the game turns around.. The game has extremely high highs, and moderately low lows.Rarely the experiences are bad, I recommend this game for most people. It's not just an FPS you shoot people in, there is a great degree of nuance, variety, and fun for both marines and aliens.The game is cheap ($10) and is very much worth the purchase, it is one of my all time favorite games.

												Severely underrated and great fun with the right people. The concept is well executed. Some server communities are toxic and prefer to surrender before a round is even halfway over if there's even an inkling of losing the match which is a shame as the balls to the wall all out brawls to the end are the best rounds. Give it a go, the game needs more players.			"

												Natural Selection 2 is NOT as good as NS1. Saying that, it's still worth a buy when it's on sale. Be prepared to only play it multiplayer, there's absolutely no storyline or singleplayer. Furthermore, there's only about a dozen maps actively in rotation.Saying that; NS2 could have been a million unit game. The balancing is perfect, and it's probably one of the most fun, rewarding, and entertaining games out there. Sadly, the dev team went wayyyyyyyyyyyy too gung-ho on the multiplayer competitive front, (thinking CS), so unless you're an old NS1 pro like myself, you'll find games are pubstomp after pubstomp, (what happens is all the pro's know to join 1 team, and alternate sides every round. This creates really super fast 5min games).Don't expect there to be any additional updates; the dev team has already moved onto their next title. It's really a shame though; the team should write the book on atmospheric development on a shoestring budget, (they developed their own game engine, textures, models, etc with less than a million dollars. Trust me, this is VERY unique!). If you're looking for a balanced and unique online game, this is it. Yes, you're playing the same map, but RARELY does it get repetitive due to the hyper complex potential for the game. At this time, the game is 24.99. I can't recommend anything more than 9.99$ for this game. Yes, I've personally dumped 200 hrs into it, but I'm an old ns1 pro. I can see a new person spending 25$, getting into a game, getting IMMEDIATELY annihilated via a pub stomp, and then chuck the game in the trash. Lack of single player (no training!), really makes this hard to get into.			"

												Lets get the obvious out of the way, NS2 offers a unique multiplayer FPS/RTS experience that you will not find anywhere else. It's PC centric with none of the dumbed down console design plaguing 90% of games this last generation. While the heart of its addictiveness and its frustrations is the competitive nature against other human players instead of vs AI. If there's a reason you will keep playing NS2, it will be because of the players you will be sharing this unique gameplay experience with.But it also has two very major problems that everyone who has played NS2 has experienced at some point - Performance & Balance. Few people have a computer capable of running NS2 at a steady 60 FPS throughout an entire match; the Lua coding and the engine has had a long history of criticism. And the game requires hundreds of hours to master its mechanics, that were majorly changed as of build 250 requiring a renewed learning curve.Balance however has always been a topic of debate since the beta, the main problem with the way the game is being balanced is UWE's obsession with trying to turn it into a competitive 6v6 e-sports rivaling that of SC2. The small crowds at events and the low amount of views can be defined as very niche, yet this is what the game is being balanced for; NOT for public play or for the majority of people that quickly join and leave NS2 throughout its sales.My personal experience with NS2 is hard to define...the first 5 months I used a mic, tried 6v6 pugs, experienced a lot of a-holism from people and played on a 1280x720 resolution. It was stressful, I hated it and ended up quitting. 5 months after with a much better computer & mouse, I picked the game up again as build 250 came out. Performance and balance issues were still very frustrating, the game was basically an on-going beta. But playing with people I became very familiar with is the reason I kept sticking around, as well as the mastery we humans care deeply about.Do I love or hate NS2? Some aspects I love, and some things about it I can't stand. It's a bittersweet experience, the game has stayed alive because UWE keeps it alive with constant updates. However it's obviously not financially viable for them. So sooner or later NS2 will fade into obscurity if it isn't already.I think for me, NS2 might have been the pinnacle of anything coming out in the next 5-10 years that has made me invest as much time into it as I have. I think the only thing I might have spent more time playing, is StarCraft.Edit: As far as clarifying how I feel about this game retrospectively, NS2 had an amazing concept, one-of-a-kind; but the execution of the public multiplayer, the balancing and the decision of UWE to code their own engine probably doomed this game. And having played NS2 for 10 months, public games are 90% frustration and 10% balanced teams; same complaint I've heard from many whom used to play NS2.And it always had a small player base for a multiplayer game, exceptions were when thousands of players would be joining and then leaving within like 2 weeks of major updates or sales. Thus I'm pretty sure that the small size of the remaining active player-base, makes a match making system completely redundant considering you need to fill up 12-24 slots; and at down-times you're lucky to find one full server in EU.I regret wasting a whole year on a game that mostly brought me stress and contempt, but I have no regrets about all the experiences I've had with the hundreds upon hundreds of players I've met throughout all my time spent with it. Whether it be good experiences or bad, I have learned from them all and as a result; I have grown both as a gamer and as a person.			"

												One of the best indie multiplayers games i have ever played.To describe it first i would say it's a mix of Counterstrike meets Starcraft. You play either a soldier/alien (FPS) or the commander commanding your teammates, upgrading weapons, abilities and building new bases etc. (RTS).Basically the game is a fight between aliens and marines about ressouces nodes all over the map, to buy better stuff or evolve into better classes by the gained ressources.A pretty interessting point in this game is also that you loose all your bought stuff as soldier once you die, so you just don't want to die and therefor most ppl play alot more tactical than they would in any other games.Only things you should be aware before buying this game is that it needs pretty high specs to run smooth, that it requires alot time to learn and master all things, that it's hard to get into at first.If you are aware of those things i guarantee you alot of fun with this game ;)TL;DR:Pros:- Interessting Mix of RTS and FPS- Asynchron Teams (Aliens and Marines)- Alot Tactical Teamplay- Fast-Paced Action Combat- Devs are supporting game still after 1 year after releaseCons:- Steep Learning Curve (about 100-500 h)- Needs high specs to run smooth- Server Browser is missing some features- No real matchmaking (yet)			"

												This game is very under rated (not even, Steam has Very Positive feedback).  One of the original RTS/FPS hybrids (the sequel of anyways) with a unique Alien vs Marine gameplay style.  Aliens can climb walls, run through vents, fly, and expand their biomass throughout space themed levels, while Marines use assault rifles, shotguns, mines, and ultimately large exo suits to combat the infestation.  Different rooms on the map have power sources, and resource generators.  You can tell who controls the area you're in just by looking at it, as Marines require power so it will be lit up and look like a space station, whereas aliens will typically take the power out and darkness and emergency lights take over, and the alien hive spreads a visual infestation throughout the corridors, similar to the Zerg in StarCraft.For as great a game as this is, there sadly seems to be no more than a few hundred people at a time playing, whereas at one time (at least during the original) there would be thousands.

												As I've often summed up (since the days of NS1), this is like the first person shooter version of a StarCraft battle between marines and the Zerg.In Natural Selection 2 it's not all about twitch reflexes (though this is faster paced than most); victory requires dynamic strategy, tactical combat, communication and team work.The strategic element to this game makes it a unique gem. It's far more engaging and complex than anything offered by Battlefield, Team Fortress, Counter Strike and similar games.The community isn't huge, but this game has no equal. Highly recommended.			"

												NS1 was one of my favourite games that time. After that NS2 was a giant letdown. The whole gameplay concept was messed up. NS1 was a tactical/strategical game, where with smart tactics you could defend the base, and advance.NS2 is a no brainer, because the map layout and the lack of effective defensive capabilites make it impossible to secure an area with turrets etc. There are too many routes to reach a point so it is impossible to play defensively, turrets are to weak to make defensive blockades. So the only option is to attack agressively and research everything as fast as you can. From the smart and deep gameplay in 2003, we stepped back again to the level of Quake 1 in 2013.			"

												Natural Selection 2 is much more than an online shooter with aliens flair, and that alone is enough to show what an exceptional title it really is. Getting started is hard and it will take time until you have discovered the game and understand all of its many subtleties but it really is worth it. At the end you will be rewarded with a complex, unique, and - assuming you have the right players on the server - incredibly exciting multiplayer experience that you can't find anywhere else.			"

												Excellent blend of FPS and non-symmetric RTS game, doing justice to the legendary natural selection 1 for half-life (1). Teamwork is very important and the game succesfully promotes this teamwork, so everyone can do his part and naturally will tend to do so. A failure of teamwork will visibly affect the game and immediately encourage players to cooperate in new strategies. The aliens and marines play very differently and have completely different tech trees and require different strategies. The graphics are amazing for this game's age, and the engine runs incredibly well (in alpha, it had some performance issues which are entirely resolved afaik). Lag is not much of an issue as opposed to for example csgo, the engine handles it very well. The game has quite a steep learning curve, but as the basic unit of each team you can definitely start doing your part and learn by following orders and watching others. Recently some very good tutorials were added also for the commander role. One of the few games that still features real teamplay, and while it allows for skill to be important, it's impossible to win a game on your own.			"

												Natural Selection 2 is a FPS / RTS combo that has you playing in:The Alien team:Where you get to be a vicious Skulk who tears everything and anything apart, As a flying creature known as Lerk who spikes marines from a distant so you can go and close the distant for a deadly poisoness bite to finish off the poor unlucky marine(s), or you can turn in a monstrosity known as Onos, a behemeth who can crush a marine under, destroy Marines structures more quicked than other Alien Lifeforms.The Marine Team:Where you build structures for your Commander for him/her to upgrade your arsenal with weapon/armor upgrades, Shotguns, Grenade Launchers or even Jetpack's to catch those Lerks and keep the high ground clear and avoid the onoses hard hits.This game requires and actually courages for you to use your microphone to communicate and make tactical moves with your team so if you got a microphone USE IT, trust me you will need it.The game overall is pretty well done and looks pretty but there are some issues like in every game:-Net-code problems-Hit registration-Unbalanced teams AKA several veterans in the opposite team causing the other team to get entirely ""stomped on""But i recommend that you should get this game BUT only when it's on sale.11/24/2016 edit:Playerbase is slowly increasing but surely.

Posted: September 27, 2014
												As someone who never played the predecessor, I can't comment on any similarities or improvements; what I can say, is that this game is one of the most enjoyable multiplayer shooty pew pew games I've played in years. First off, it looks lovely. Whether you're playing Aliens or Marines, the game has a very nice polished look to it and while the standard map rotation isn't massive, they are well balanced, which is something I have found to be lacking in a lot of similar team based games. The balance is more impressive when you consider that these aren't typical teams, either. Playing as the basic Alien species, the Skulk, gives you the ability to wall walk and hang onto ceilings, making you a perfect ambush predator. Marines can develop jet packs later in the game, allowing them to fly, but both teams have very distinct differences which makes the need for balance more important.NS2 is also a game which is very hard to 'carry'. Whereas in other games in a similar vein, you can have a random player join your team and absolutely face ♥♥♥♥ the opposite team with seemingly no help from you or your mates, who are in their minds probably sat with their heads up their arses. This is a game where teamwork is absolutely necessary to succeed, and when you do succeed, it is glorious. A win on this game on either team feels amazing, like you've worked your balls off to earn it.As with every other multiplayer game in existence, you will sometimes get a♥♥♥♥♥♥team. Sometimes you will be on that team, it happens. Other times you will be on the murdering death squad team and feel like you're a god. A lot of the time this responsibility rests on the team Commander. The Commander will sit in the Hive/Command chair, depending on the team, and will take on a top down view of the map. They are in charge of deploying resources and upgrading abilities/equipment for their team; they also direct their team mates as to where they should push or where the commander thinks they should push. Team synergy between the troops and the commander is vital, and I've not seen that nailed so well before as in this game.The NS2 community is also very friendly. The first time I decided to play Commander I was a nervous wreck, but I was guided and helped by my team mates and - shock horror - NOT screamed at for my lack of experience. I've been in the odd game where new players are given crap, but the vast majority of games I have played have been with very nice people who are endlessly helpful. Even starting out playing, other players will help if you ask and give you tips as to what to do.One downside I've found to this game, and it's a major one, is that the player base appears to be dwindling. This means that relatively full games are getting harder to come by, especially later on at night. Many servers are empty and it's a real shame, because this game is a bundle of fun once you get to grips with it, which leads on to my next point.NS2 has somewhat of a steep learning curve. When I say steep, I mean that it takes a while to get learn the benefits and playstyle of each Alien and also the Marine weaponry and equipment. I've personally found that this isn't a game where you can just pick a class and play however the hell you want, you have to know what you're doing with certain things otherwise you can be a bit of a spare part. For example, when you play on the Alien team, initially you will spawn as a Skulk. To play the other 'classes', you have to Evolve into them and this is done through your own personal resources which increase as you play, push and kill. The most expensive class, the Onos, is an absolute beast, but new players (and old) can sometimes be seen playing them and just rushing into Marine bases because at first glance you see your massive health pool and think you're an immortal juggernaut. Tactical maneuvres, organised by and with your team, are the key to success in this game and the solo warrior approach simply will not work.NS2 also offsets potential pitfalls presented by fellow players. Occasionally, you will get a complete and utter turd as your Commander - it happens. Thankfully, you can choose to Eject ♥♥♥♥♥♥ commanders, along with a plethora of other commands such as voting, signalling to your team mates and taunting, amongst others. Team communication is vital in this game so a mic goes a long way for those times when you're getting the♥♥♥♥♥♥shot out of you and can't type your predicament. Map pinging also helps brings sticky situations to your team mates' and commander's attention.Overall, awesome game. I only hope that the playerbase gets a revival, because it is a shame that more people don't get to experience the brilliance that is Natural Selection 2. "

												Very good game. Has an rts and fps mix in it. Rts when you are in the commander/hive controller role and fps as a marine/skulk. Purely team oriented as your commander tells you where to go on the map in order to control it and win. Does have a medium-hard learning curve, lots of things to learn and remember. Once you get the hang of it tho, it is fun. Especially when you have a good team, you can spend countless hours battling just on a single map! This game does have that aliens vs marines feel and I recommend  to those that felt disappointed from them ♥♥♥♥♥♥ aliens games.Not as many people playing as it should have (most likely cuz of the learning curve) but it has enough to find a few full games.Very underated game! Definitely buy!			"

												I've read many reviews complaining about an update that moved server-lists to a different, clearly visible, tab.  I have to say that after purchasing this game I honestly believed that my experience would be mediocre at best:  Veterans calling out noobs, discouraging them to continue playing, etc.  Not once in my short period of owning this game has this happened.  (I'm willing to rule out that I'm lucky and just haven't been around 'those' people).However, I can tell you this:  As an achievement hunter, I was able to contact a developer on the official discord server (Remi, you're awesome!).  This person took the time out to help me join a private server full of veterans for a 'Captain's Night' (Shout out to TGNS, you folks are great and I hope to play with you all again!) and was nice about it.  Not only that, but the folks I played with were all immensely supportive of a 'greenie' being on their side.  Folks in the voice-comms were giving me tips, telling me to follow them around, and showing me some really neat tricks.I personally like small maps with 7v7 teams; it allows you to know the folks you're playing with (especially if they are in comms).  I've had a great experience so far.TLDR; This game is awesome and I highly recommend it for the experience and the community.			"

												Very fun and well made game at first, but it has many problems. The primary problem it has, is its community, it is very small due to large skill differences between players. The only players that continue to play this game for long are very skilled and end up driving away less experienced or new players causing the community to continually shrink. The game is very frustrating to new players due to its skill requirement; many times it is hard to get on an even play level with anyone and thus stupid deaths is frequent for many new players. Expect to die and feel regret or repulsion towards   playing the game.			"

												Great game, loved it the moment i started playing. It maybe a struggle to understand the basics straight away, but its a rewarding game once you get the hang of it. Only down side is the server/player balance, unless the players themselves are willing to have a fair go and have a balanced game, it can be a grind. E.g average game should go for more than 15 mins not under 5. overall, 9/10			"

												This game is unlike anything you've played, unless it's Nuclear Dawn.I bought this game due to the idea of being able to play RTS and FPS. Wasn't exactly what I thought it was as you can be either one or the other. It does allow for a commander in multiplayer mode and you have to actively work with your team to build new sort of ""buildings"" or stations. You issue the order, they physically have to go there and build it and possibly protect it. There are two opposing teams going at it at one time : humans and the parasites. Humans have their respective weapons, and you are able to choose what you would like to use from the ammo bin (once it's built)! Being the parasites takes a bit of practice to really hone control or get a kill. Parasites also come in variations as some fly, some are small and quick, some are used to build their own defensive systems. Unlike human upgrades (regarding weapons), beasts upgrade gradually when you choose to evolve them. You can get evolve points the more you successfully kill opponents. There are a lot of people saying the game has a steep learning curve (which is sort of does) but all the in-game players were more than willing to answer any immediate questions I had. The game becomes easier of course the more you play it. Do not be afraid to learn! Depending on who your commander is for your team, you can either have a great game or an okay game. One may ask who would I rather be, the beasts or the marines? To be honest, I preferred beasts at first due to the ability to climb about on walls and be invisible on creeps but over time I learned how fun it is to be a marine. Graphics are absolutely impeccable on this one. Sounds are appropriate for the world the dev created. Makes you nervous when you start hearing things and you know your about to be attacked.RATING : solid 8/10 - this is a must buy if it's on sale!Gameplay B+ Story / Campaign N/A Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability B Overall  BFor future Natural Selection games : maybe have a few vehicle options (or fixed weapons placements). I understand the concept of one person in charge of a team, but the problem arises that no one wants to be the guy watching instead of playing. Maybe allow for a real-time planner?ScreenShots : First person view puts you right into the mouth of the beasts  A continuation from the first screen shot... just to show if you stand still you can go invisible What the commander view looks like "

												Realy cool arcade team based FPS game, witch also have part of RTS if you choise to be commander for mariens or ailens. I recomend it to all that enjoyed playing Alien vs Predator multiplayer back in 1999 and to others who dident its definety worth buying on some sale. Also sugesting to all before playing to check some guide videos there is alot to learn and it will help so mutch to undestand whats going on when the game is on! I think that got it for around 5 euros and it is definety worth buying =)			"

												Really fun game. I love team games with an overarching ""economy"". Every kill or map position taken has inherent value and watching an enemy lose an Exo to a Gorge is satisfying. I would however mention that due to its less populated community and high skill cap commander position, it will be very difficult to get into as a newer player. I highly reccomend consuming guides and sources about the commander before playing as it is very crucial to the game flow. Think about how playing a support in a MOBA gets you yelled at. Yeah...it's worse.			"

												Fun cross between an FPS and an RTS. The only other game that I've seen similar to it was an old game called Savage: The battle for Newerth.There's an RTS element, with a commander, who focuses on giving commands (although with human players, they're more like requests than commands, as the players don't have to obey them), placing buildings, researching tech, and managing resources.The players meanwhile play it like an FPS. I prefer playing as a marine because it's fun to shoot down aliens. Although you really have to watch your shots, as it's really easy to miss, and you burn through ammo quick. And if you can coordinate with a few other marines to form a fireteam, you can usually hold your own quite well, even with just basic rifles, armor, and other tech.At only $10, the game is not expensive, and it offers hours of fun.Recommended.

												First a little description of the game. It's multiplayer only and there are 2 sides, aliens and marines. I'm quite honestly surprised how balanced this game is, there isn't an overpowered side winning depends entirely on you and your team (and how competent the enemy team is too I suppose).Both teams start out with a base and one resource tower, These towers provide resources for your commannder to build buildings and upgrades for you e.g sentries/better guns for marines or more armour and powers for aliens. The towers also provide each player with resources which they can spend on better weapons for marines or stronger and higher lifeforms for aliens.You expand across the map taking more bases and resource towers and fighting the opposing team, victory comes from there surrender or you obliterating there base. I prefer the latter.The only real downsides is that lobbies often become so one sided with all the best players sticking to one team the game is decided before it has started and ocne in a while you will get a commander who either doesn't know what they are doing or are trolling on purpose which gives you a very high chance to lose.9/10			"

Big guns and flamethrowers keep those crawlers away! Not enough manpower? Build turettes to keep em at bay ;)Really awesome is the function as a commander. It takes you out of the ego-shooter and puts you in a RTSish position where you have to build resource generators, command your players to actually act like a elite squad commandos ^^			"

												Is this game any good?On paper this game is great, asymetrical fps with commanders? sounds amazing!But I can say with confidence that this is the worst multiplayer game I've ever played, the amount of dissapointment I'm feeling right now is palpable.Where it falls down is execution, and where it falls down, it drops through the floor and into hell.All of the aliens have a problem where your FOV is inside of their mouth, again sounds great for immersion! but in reality the aliens bite things so attacking will block your field of view completely. Also so far as I can tell basic alien's bite works off of gun physics and won't hit anything you aren't aiming directly at. Either that or the hit detection is an *expletive removed* and just plain barely works.The game is designed around fast paced twitch gameplay with mostly melee and weak aliens vs marines with guns. However the resource system is designed around being really slow and punishing you for deaths by forcing you to play as a skulk for 90% of the game while you're learning.The game is abysmally unoptimized, so unoptimized that its not even funny, loading times are seriously minutes long, not even kidding. I actually have to turn settings down to run a bot server with the default amount of bots, and I bet you're saying ""OH well you should get a better computer!"" the truth is I can't, there is exactly one better processor and more powerful graphics cards do not exist outside of tri or quad sli setups.The commander job is fantastic on paper, really innovative! Ingame it is a *expletive removed* that overshadows the rest of the entire game. The problem with NS2 is that you are entirely dependant on your commander, and your commander is entirely dependent on you. In theory this is fine, in practice it makes learning the game a *expletive removed* *expletive removed* *expletive removed* pile of zit puss.Because the commander doesn't have much agency on their own, so nobody wants to play the commander for long, its a job that is nessasary but not engaging enough to be something that enough people actually want to specilize in to keep the game going. Its a core mechanic of the game and its frankly a janitor job, and only ""strategy"" in a broad sense, in a more specific and accurate sense its herding randoms on the internet around.Think about that for a moment, think about how many random people on the internet are willing to follow orders, and how many of them you would trust to give orders. Now narrow that list down to people who bought this game, are willing to sit in the commander chair, and are willing to attempt the massive learning curve for the alien side of things. Now throw in a team of toxic people who can grow impatient with a bad commander.Thats what I think is the biggest problem with natural selection since the player and commander are entirely codependent you need a good team to make things work and there is very little that you can do to help out a bad team. This could have been avoided by giving the commander something fun to do, like traditional ai controled soldiers to bring in more rts elements, or the ability to zoom out and see any decent portion of the map. Or something, anything to make the commander more interesting and easier to play in the face of their own incompetence or the incompotence of their team.As it stands your enjoyment of this game will depend entirely upon your tolerance for other players and your willingness to get stomped into the ground for an entire round anytime you have a subpar team.

												Unknown World's Natural Selection 2 is the second game in the hit science-fiction trilogy of the same name. Natural Selection 2 picks up where the first game ended with our hero Charles Darwin using his time machine to transport himself 1,500 years into the future. In the opening scene, players find themselves in a dystopian sky city of the year 3370 A.D. Players soon discover that all of the citizens who inhabit the game's world are devout creationists, and while the world starts off as beautiful and serene, the scene quickly turns dark when the characters in the world discover Charles' identity. Natural Selection 2 strives to call important issues into question which test our society today. For example, in one scene, the player is selected for a lottery where he or she has the choice to throw a baseball at a married couple comprised of an evolutionist and a global warming believer, or at the lottery host. Needless to say, NS2 achieves art status because of this powerful scene which serves as an analogue to the oppression of scientists in our very own twenty-first century and deserves a place in every steam user's library.

												I recommend against the purchase of this game.I admit, I haven't given this game too much of my time.  And yet, I don't feel as though I am being unjust.<Quick Overview>pros:funfast pacedteam work basedcons:Game is possibly abandoned (no regular updates)extremely long load timesservers are empty (hardly anyone plays this game anymore)non stop yellingnot beginner friendlypoor balancing (aliens are superior)<Indepth Review>In Natural Selection 2, you play on the side of the Marines or the aliens.The two sides use a combination of RTs style structure building (the commander) and first person shooting (everyone else). The two sides have upgrades, structures, team work, and their brains to best the other side.This game is fun, It'll kill sometime if you're bored. However, it gets old very fast for a large number of reason.1) You can tell from the ""Christmas splashpage"" on the title screen, that this game does not recieve many updates. It is nearly February and we are still being shown Christmas images.2) The game's connection and loading speeds are awful. In order to connect to the ""tutorial"", I was subject to an unbelievably long time period. I was able to boil some pasta and prepare myself a nice carbonara before it was done loading.3) When connecting to the server list, one can see many servers. Unfortunately, there are only 10 or less servers that are actually being used. On average, the servers hold 10 people. This is a good indication that this game is dead and plaers have abandoned it for its many flaws.4)Advanced players of this game have no room for beginners. They will scream and belittle anyone who doesn't understand the game mechanics immediately. The only reason they won't kick you, is because there is strength in numbers.If you'd like a ""get yelled at"" simulation, then this game may be for you.5) Aliens have an advantage in this game. The aliens are capable of very quick movements. WIth how shooting is implemented in this game, it is disasterous for the marines. Therefore, everoyne wants to play on the alien side and you are left with an unbalanced team.<Conclusion>It's a fun game, but save your money. The many flaws of this game has led it to lose its player base.I'd consider it if it was on a great sale (75% off and up) and if I had many friends that were interested in playing.			"

												Spent an hour in game.  May not seem like much, but it was enough honestly.  This game looks like it was really good, at one point in time after it was released, however, since then, I have no clue what happened.  I tried my best.  I played the tutorial, I played 2 separate multiplayer matches as both teams and multiple classes.  I gave this game every chance I could as a beginner, but I'm sorry to say, I uninstalled it after an hour.  This game is BRUTAL to any newcomers, with a steep learning curve and online players that seem to be training for MLG, and do not welcome newcomers, let alone give any help.  The gameplay is alright, but left a bit unpolished.  The graphics are very well done really, and the sound is alright, although the voice acting is horrendous.I just cannot recommend this game in it's current state.  Newcomers are essentially shunned, as are casual players or anyone looking for some simple multiplayer shooter fun.  You'll be ousted and forgotten by the players, and the game mechanics themselves will show no quarter.TL;DR:  Game has passed it's hayday and caters only to the competetive veterans whilst discouraging newcomers.

												This game is all about your physical aiming skill once you learn the basics. It gets worse every day, my review was positive before the updates.I was back from a 2 year break and couldn't get a good game in 3 freaking hours. Once ANYTHING goes wrong everybody just give up and vote concede. You wanna get a jetpack, onos or exo ? This will almost never happen.Developers had such a good game design ideas, but they were all destroyed by very high movement speed, bunny hopping, and super fast kill times. All you do is keep moving into and out of the player while jumping to mess up his aim. The worst part that commanders force everyone into this play style by not doing tactics/stealth-oriented upgrades, turning you into a mindless bunnyhopping zombie who swings his mouse left and right.

												I have played many many hours with Natural Selection 2 and for the most part, I have greatly enjoyed my experience. My feelings about it are very complex, as it's a bold and innovative step in FPS multiplayer, has excellent developer support, and a pretty good community to boot. There are frequent updates and gameplay balances, and a new map is released roughly every six months or so. The two opposing factions are assymetrically balanced and gameplay is varied and interesting. So much so that you don't mind playing the same few maps over and over again countless times. In some respects, this game has pretty much everything going for it. Sadly, I simply cannot recommend Natural Selection 2 for one very specific reason. The game's greatest strength is its ability to seamlessly blend the RTS experience with the FPS experience, and when you have a team that works well together, under a commander who knows the ropes, this game offers one of the most fun multiplayer experiences available. It is this same strength which is also the game's greatest flaw. Very often - almost always - your experience is entirely dependant on the person in the command chair. To begin with, no one ever wants to be commander. You will sometimes spend as much as 10 minutes waiting for someone's patience to wear thin enough that they finally get into the command chair, at which point you are at their mercy. Sometimes you will even spend longer waiting for the commander than the actual game lasts. If this person happens to be you, your command experience will go one of three ways: 1) You will do an excellent job and everyone will love you for it, in which case your game will likely be over very quickly. 2) You will do an excellent job and everyone will hate you for it anyway, because you didn't build X thing at Y time. They will complain at you for arbitrary reasons, even though you are winning the game. 3)You will do a bad job and everyone will hate you for it, likely resulting in you being kicked from the command position, ostricized, and ruining everyone's fun. Additionally, while the game is quite expertly balanced, it takes very little to upset that balance. A bad or good commander can mean everything in a game, and very often the fun and enjoyment of as many as 24 people hinges on that commander's ability to play the game. It's not uncommon to spend hours going from stacked game to stacked game because teams just can't seem to turn out right. And then, when that magical golden ratio finally occurs, and the game looks like it's going to be a long, bloody, brutal fight to the death, someone rushes your base and the game is over before you have time to check the map. So, while I have had some real fun with Natural Selection 2, at the end of the day I just can't recommend a game with such a massive, fundamental, and irreversible flaw. The average player just has to put in way too much effort and patience to squeeze the fun out of this game. But I do admit that if you manage to do so, you will be in for quite a treat.			"

												The good: - innovative and almost unique game play with RTS-commander, lots of weapons, abilities and possible strategies - two totally different yet balanced teams - the developer Unknown Worlds Entertainment is very committed to the game and has published several free content upgrades since launch - shiny and polished graphics - small but stable and very committed communityThe bad: - some players report performance issues - the game stands and falls with its players/potentially frustratingCounterstrike meets Starcraft: Some people describe this game as a shooter with a supporting commander for each team. It is not! It is a fully grown RTS with real players as units. This is important to understand if you want to have fun with it. I've seen my share of marketing claims asserting game X would really endorse team play. They all lied. Not so with Natural Selection 2. It doesn't ""endorse"" team play, it simply makes it a requirement for victory. You need your team, your team needs its commander and the commander needs the team to follow his orders. It's a symbiosis. This is the strongest part of Natural Selection 2 and it's the feature that sets it apart from other games. In a way it could be seen as a game about leadership, and at the end of the day, when everybody knows the tech-tree and how to deal with opponents and the commander has learned the ""best build order"" and the countless possible strategies there is still work to do. Sometimes the biggest challenge seems to be to keep the team's morale up. This is where communication comes into play, an important part of the game. It is incredibly rewarding to overcome a worthy opponent and there are no achievements or unlockables in this game. Winning itself is the achievement. And if there's no teamwork? Well, that's when Natural Selection 2 gets incredibly frustrating. Especially veterans can often tell how a game will end after 30 seconds. And it's always YOUR fault. See that NooB over there? YOU need to talk to him and make him follow you. It's impossible for the commander to take care of every single player. If you just want to casually shoot some Aliens, this is probably not your game, but if you want to enjoy team play and are willing to commit to a degree: don't wait any longer. It's regularly on sale for €2,49. There is hardly any reason to not at least give it a try!			"

												I put off doing a review on this title for a long time. Not sure why, but I probably just forgot.The RTS genre is dieing out, if it hasn't already. So instead of developers cranking out RTS games, we are starting to see a new trend of FPS-RTS hybrids. Nuclear Dawn is an example of this, and TF2 could have been the same way (see developer commentary). I used to be a big fan in many regards, but there just doesn't seem to be any good classics. EA over milking their acquired IP such as C&C has lead to disappointment, and reason as to why they were voted the worst company 3 times in a row.Many describe Natural Selection 2 to be like Counter-Strike in many regards. It's true for the most part, as realism isn't the focus -- competitive play is. Updates seem regular enough to resolve problems which is nice to see.While it's unfortunate that the developers scraped using the Source engine, it is certainly nice to see people try and release competing engines. One of the certain draw backs to releasing a custom built engine has to be the increased work of maintaining not only the engine but the game. After I don't know how many updates, the developers continue to ignore the hull sizes of models. Could it be caused by an oversight in development? Certainly, but for how long it's been with the game, it's ridiculous. When I refer to hull sizes, I'm talking about the collision ""mesh"" which detects where things can fit. The tanky alien unit ""Onos"" fails in this regard, being able to fit (and let alone jump) to places that don't make any logical sense. The outside parts of the model just pass through solid objects, which can really infuriate marine players.Part of competitive play has to do with teamwork. While new fronts have been opened in regards to making the first time experience more inviting, some work needs to be done else where. Even with the dynamic loading of textures and models, it just takes way to long to load maps. Servers still seem to be single core based, so GSPs will not be jumping at it because server processors tend to be clocked lower.While certainly pressing new ideas into the industry that lacks a lot, I wouldn't want to rush at this game.7.5/10			"

												Ok I was wiff waffling on buying this becuase of some of the reviews about server latency and FPS drops and optimization and a toxic community thats fast paced and mean to new people. Gues what I experienced! NONE OF THAT STUFF! Ok lemme give you guys my system specs I know this an old game so just about anyone can run it but hey what the heck! I have a crappy FX4300 3.8ghz-4ghz turbo and a MSI RX470 OC Armor gaming with 4GB of DDR5 v-ram(this game only uses 2gb at the most so dont trip if thats what you got) and finally 8gb's system ram. I get a cpu bottleneck on newer next gen games obviously but on this I have v-sync on and set to double buffer and graphics all the way up and play in HD and I have never experienced a single frame rate drop below 59fps and thats like literally for a millisecond but other than that a SOLID 60FPS. As for server latency I had one instance at like 2AM when I was on a european server and it got unbearable and ping was too high other than that NOTHING! Now the other big complaint that I saw THE COMMUNITY! I havent experienced anyone being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ yet, everyone is helpful and even when we are losing and are commander sucks♥♥♥♥♥or is new no one gets bent outta shape like in other games which is suprising to me. I also read in one review that the Mechs in the preview or the giant Rhino monsters never get used or rarely? Thats a lie, every match Ive played Ive been a mech or Oros(giant rhino). Idk why this game is getting so much beef lol Its WEIRD! It really is WEIRD to me! GRAPHICS-Its an older game but it still looks great at ultra in HD and is really well optimized, Ive had a solid 60fps no matter what whether its me and 8 marines all shooting flame throwers and grenade launchers and firing mini guns at an alien hive a SOLID 60FPS. GAMEPLAY-Its fast paced, interesting, and intense at times. The marines try to stick together and keep resources flowing and the power on while the aliens stealthily creep through the vents or latch to the ceiling just above a doorway and listen for the sound of your combat boots inching closer then POUNCE! CHOMP! CHOMP! One dead marine lol From the COMMANDER perspective the game plays like a good RTS with you being able to research upgrades for the other players on the team and enable weapons for them to purchase with their individual points their earn through combat and building and destroying enemy buildings. You can as the marine commander play turrets and extractors for resources and armories for refitting your fellow marines and even robot buidlers. The Alien side is a different experience with you only being able to build in areas infected with cysts which coat the surrounded area in this seething mass of organic material upon which you can build and you research evolutionary traits that your team mates can evolve to obtain by entering a sort of cacoon. Its diverse and very fun and when you get bored of the shooter side then be commander and BOOM! Its a totally different GAME!COMMUNITY-I have never be griefed or trolled by any players besides one and he was on the enemy team and was like 16 so typical internet stuff nothing pervasive or out of the norm. Other than that the more experienced players have been laid back and helpful and dont seem to sweat losing or playing with noobs. Now the game isnt dead you can always find people playing at all times and when the match isnt full there are bots that can be your marines or even command(SOMETHING NONE OF THOSE REVIEWS MENTIONED) Ive played MUCH MORE TOXIC games than this and honestly idk what people are talking about in these reviews lolIN CONCLUSION-I was almost not gonna buy this game becuase people said its dead, the communities evil and toxic, the game is unoptimized, and the servers are all crap. Well I bought it and NONE OF THAT is true and Im honestly perplexed by those reviews. Seriously idk what happened that made them so bitter sounding but damn son, the game is AWESOME! Its got a original concept with the RTS/FPS hybrid style that is saddly lacking in todays game creation and in my opinion one the most exciting and fun developements in game concepts since open world games started becoming a norm and craze. I know when I first started the game a message popped up about a new patch they did I didnt really read it but maybe they fixed all the things those people where upset about becuase none of the negatives in the thumbs down reviews that I read before getting this have I seen or even experienced. I recommend this game becuase its like 2 good games in one a good fast paced shooter and a good RTS and each faction has unique and interesting play styles and characters. Games alil old but looks great too! Im giving it a rock solid 8/10 now if they had a 3rd faction and 3v3 maps ooooh boy! 9/10 easy! So get it if your interested becuase its really suprised me just how good it is and how muddy its reputation has gotten with a few bitter reviews.			"

												This is probably the best asymmetric RTS/FPS hybrid of all time, but there really aren’t that many of them so that really isn’t huge deal. More importantly, this is probably one of the best games of all time as it contains a mixture of unique gameplay elements that no other games has. It definitely is my favourite game which actually sounds a bit strange to me when I think about it.I find that strange because I never really enjoyed FPS games a great deal. Prior to NS2 I played mostly strategy titles (RTS and turn based), and I believe what hooked me into this game was the gameplay elements of deep strategy, blended in with teamwork and individual skill. All these aspects of the game are so important that it is really not clear which one of them is more important in this game. Possible concerns: This game is niche title, with an active (albeit small) community where you really shouldn’t have any trouble finding a game. If you are worried that you “missed the boat” I don’t think you have anything to worry about if you are interested in this game. I don’t think it is likely the game will outright “die” as it fills a gameplay niche that is very difficult to get right like NS2 has. For the best experience find a server/community you like, help them seed a their server and you’ll have fun. The game isn’t particularly expensive and even goes down to 5$ at steam sales.Most people who have an issue with the game don’t really have huge issues with the game itself but with their perceptions of the community and health of the game (see discussions). However, despite these issues the game is still very much supported by the developers and has a dedicated community so their should be no reason why you shouldn’t give the game a shot if you are at all interested in the game. The servers/communities are fairly diverse and I suggest you look into all the different communities (make sure to also look in the arcade tab in the server browser) to find one that suits you before you make any judgements as a whole.Edit: Anyone claiming this game is full of hackers is full of it. I've ran into maybe 1 or 2 people I was fairly sure were hacking in my >2000 hours of NS2. NS2 is under VAC protection and hacking for this game is rare. Take anyone with <100 hours who claims they've seen a hacker without sufficent proof with a grain of salt. Honestly they likely ran into people who are just likely much better than them, and their egos couldn't take it. Gameplay: This is a RTS/FPS hybrid so it can be difficult to describe what the gameplay actually feels like in a short summary.On the field (where most of your time is spent):The game can be very fast paced, requiring good twitch reaction skills to be good in traditional combat situations. Thus, it might feel like the game is initially just like any other FPS where for the most part it seems like winning is about out-killing your opponents. However, the goal in the game is actually to economically starve  your opponents (via territory/map control) and to ultimately kill their last command structure. Everything else in the game emerges from that. This means there are other game elements unexpectedly sprinkled in, like stealth elements, tactical fake-outs, secret backdoor rushes, baiting, distractions, and sometimes killing yourself intentionally (to respawn at base or to kill a critical structure). Thus, having a keen strategic mind to spot and exploit opportunity, even if you aren’t a commander, is an asset in this game.Commanding:If you want to try commanding it cannot be understated how important the role is, but not in the way you might think. Commanding can be fast paced, like a game of starcraft, but feels different from a traditional RTS as you cannot directly control your core “units”. To win, team cooperation is the most important thing. Each core “unit” has a mind of their own and if you do anything to demoralize them by doing things they don’t understand or don’t commonly see when playing other games this can basically make your time commanding unbearable. To mitigate this, you need communication (to explain what you are trying if someone questions you), and need to show that you have an understanding how the game works (requires watching games/commanders or playing on the field a while).Concerns relating to the high skill ceiling of the game:There is a lot of talk about how hard the game is as relatively high skill veterans make up a large portion of the persistent player base. If you play past the rookie stage you will play against 1 or 2 these guys and I’d imagine it can feel like you can’t do anything against these guys. I’m probably almost one of them at this point, but I do remember a time when I wasn’t, and a key thing to remember is that this game is actually a strategy game and getting kills on your opponents doesn’t matter as much as you might think.For instance, when I know I can’t out-skill/kill the other team, I instead focus on thinking “what is the most productive thing I can do instead”. In NS2 you don’t need to kill the enemy team’s players to win, so worrying about your KDR is mostly not productive. As an alien, if you can’t win straight up fights realize that you don’t even need to always fight. Get past the enemy lines and hit unprotected resource nodes (you can crawl on walls silently and vents exist for a reason). For new players who find the combat difficult, just being aware of what is happening around the map (flashing red things) can be much more of an asset then being able to obtain a high KDR.You will get better at the game, in the meantime, try to compensate in other ways. There are some skill limit servers (e.g. Dungeon Gaming <1800 hive) that you could try to seed to minimize your exposure to high skilled players. Finally, I almost feel bad saying this because it is open to abuse, but in the worst case scenario if you don’t feel ready for non-rookie servers and your time is up - Make a family sharing account and play on that to get rookie status again if you need it. Remember, rookie servers are for people learning the game, please don’t abuse it. Overall, after you get the basics from a few rounds on rookie servers and the tutorials I strongly encourage learning the game in depth in non-rookie servers to learn the game faster.			"

												Certainly *the worst* developer here on Steam. It's no surprise that Steve Miller Band's ""Take the Money and Run"" is UWE's theme song.They banned users from their forums for reporting bugs and completely dropped development not more than a year after release, only to use all the funds (raised from duping loyal backers, offering expensive 'supporter' packages to ensure 'proper development') for another game. They constantly feigned how little money they had and sob stories on how they could barely afford water (while renting an office in San Francisco and giving themselves handsome salaries). They just dropped development and left the community to fix all the issues (essentially free workers to improve their broken game, which they still sell and offer no compensation to community devs).The funny thing is that when UWE secretly decided to completely drop development, they made several last money-grab-and-ditch efforts through sales and 'supporter' skins/items packages, offering forum badges, etc. and giving people the false impression that development would continue. Users on deals sites called them out on it, repeatedly, while it was all going down.UWE would be able to teach wallstreet a few tricks, had they any brains or any less integrity.In sum: These guys are complete scumbags - they make DigitalHomicide look like Ghandi.

												Having played this game for so long and giving it another try, I remember well I stopped playing in the first place.  The two teams are not just asymmetrical, they are outright unbalanced.  So much so that a single, high tier player is all it takes to decide the game.  There is just no way to deal with how crazy some of their aiming capabilities are or ability to dodge as aliens.  This fact along makes the game a chore to play, add in the learning curve and the fact that UWE has never been good at balancing the gameplay.  The original NS had significant imbalance issues that took practically the entire development of that mod to finally iron out, by then it was desolate of an active, teeming player base.  Natural Selection 2 is a game with great setting, art style, and technical chops.  It is a shame the core gameplay can be so lopsided and difficult to work through.  Add in that the developers have for all intents and purposes abandoned the game to the community.  That is the death knell of a game, from here on out it is just running on the original steam from its release.			"

												My beef with this game is that it rewards only those who understand the glitches and overpowered techniques in this game. For example. Using a skork unit and trying to ambush a skilled marine will result in the marine hopping out of sight and into the air while doing a 360 turn midair, while reloading, then shooting you once with the shotgun and you are dead.Forget about the 10 minutes it took you to sneak up to this player. Attacking someone in the back will result in the human jumping in to the air and dodging all future melee attacks. It takes up to 4 melee attacks to kill a marine. this makes it so that you cannot sneak attack players and be rewarded for your stealth. The only time sneak attacks will work are when you attack a noob marine.This is why I quit the game because stealth is not rewarded and only those players who have been playing this for ages will win the fights because they know all the ridiculous glitches to come on top of a fight no matter what you do.I also think that late game, these massive units appear in the game where players control a mech or a giant dinosaur rhino, kind of ruin it completely. Things look really arcady and cheesy sometimes. Especially when all the marines hop around jumping higher in the air than the actual aliens.			"

												Amazing fast paced FPS game, Amazing community, And overall they all taking serious in a ranked match and also it has a ranked system. they maded rookie servers for people who are new in the game. If you searching a good game with RTS and FPS remixed together this might be for you, Cause it has No Micro. (♥♥♥♥ing i hate microtransactions) So that means your lucky! you can use your mic to plan a attack and many more trust me im a League of Legends gamer and i played NS2 more than that, the overall experiance of the game is amazing i mean it has a good graphics for it, you can also buy some skins in Market for you Marine or Alien and it has a nice price point for everybody, i mean decent price point for skins and game itshelf, So as i said Fast Paced, FPS & RTS remixed together, And also it has a great community to help you out. what could you ask more? go get the game you gonna love it.BUT...It has also its negative sides.. -There are more Rookie servers than Normal Ranked servers so sometimes its hard to find a empty place for yourshelf. -Somtimes if you play a ranked match and if your in a good team the other side (Alien Side) some players will leave cause of a bad commander (CC) and there will be bots in the place of a Player and they will hit you really really good i mean the bots are a bit OP.. -The servers has sometimes a overload (Highly Ping) so it lags like hell and its nearly IMP to play your match..But overall i recommend to everybody, I mean give it a try its worth it.8/10(Some spell faults maded Sorry!)

												It's a very cool concept in theory, but don't expect much time in game. At the time i'm writing this, there are about 60 or so total players, enough to fill two servers to max with a handful scattered between the rest. the player base for this game is small to the point that i couldn't find much of a chance to play this game to it's full potential, entering lobbies with maybe five others, not nearly enough to get some fun out of it.Unless they can up the number of players, Consider playing something else.

												It's not perfect, just like any game, but this is one of, if not the, best game in my library. It's a multiplayer shooter/RTS hybrid, as in; if you're the commander, you have a top down view and can build structures, order troops, and more. Although the two teams, (alien and marine) are completely different, it is balanced better than any game in existence that offers aesymmetical gameplay. The marines are more like your standard shooter, but there's no aim down sights, like many of the best tactical shooters such as CS, but the aliens are the most fun, with their in-mouth view. With the aliens, you can evolve to different species, you start off as a skulk, then, (in order of cost) Gorge, the healer, the Lerk, A flying Creature, The Fade, with it's deadly claws and blink ability. Then there is the Onos, the tank. All these are brought with resources, which you get for capturing res towers and holding them. It's the best multiplayer game I've ever played.			"

It has a few flaws in randomizing teams because one side can get stack very easliy.~Updated Review as of 6/5/2016~Developer are really going into town with their updates and fixing a lot of bugs and making better changes to the change with more customization, more maps and dedicated community to help out.New players are coming in but I recommend the brand new tutorial to grab the feel before jumping into the fray of things.I believe this is really fun MOBA to play with since it doesn't deal with X character having Y powers but more freedom on player's to choose their setup and playstyle.Not all good thing have without it's flaws. There are some annoying spots in certains maps can be very annoying to the other teams. Also Ghosting and hacks are prone here as well. Happy hunting.			"

Telling other REAL players where to go, allocating them resources when they call and overall stressing as I watch to see whether my squad successfully clears a room of aliens or is over run, with me in the base next. . .An absolute gem of a game, the developers STILL support it YEARS later, it has a health selection of mods and the graphics and gameplay are all very smooth. Well worth price of admission, if you're into science-fiction, shooters, RTS and base building the game is for you!			"

												- 9 / 10 - NS2 is a fast-paced action FPS, heavily reliant on team-work, strategy & twitch reactions. It's a unique blend of FPS with real-time strategy elements. It pits two teams (Aliens VS Marines) against each-other in online matches. Graphics are very nice, performance is ok - the custom made engine (Spark) does seem to be quite CPU demanding, yet a comprehensive options menu allow for various tweaking. Gameplay is awesome, sound assets are okay.  It's good fun, competitive, but also newbie friendly. Has a great community that are steadily active (so you'll always be able to find a game). It's essentially a game about map / resource control, upgrading / evolution tech research & using various weapons / skills & abilities - it's pretty sweet.As a huge fan of both the original HL1 mod & the indie dev team, I must admit I wasn't too impressed with the initial release due to bugs, performance issues, lack of content & balancing issues - yet true to their word UWE rolled out (& continue to do so) patches / updates & free content, fully addressing my intial concerns. I fully respect UWE approch to the development process where they where open to community suggestions & really made an effort to involve players with the process even from pre-order. If not even pioneering the technique of early-access / beta release with ongoing development.This is a must play for any action FPS fan!			"

												Awesome hybrid strategy and team-based FPS game. Skill is important but cooperation with your team mates is above all critical to winning. The game has a small, dedicated population but there are always large games available at any time of the day to join. The biggest downside to this game is that when the skill level of each team is not balanced, the games will be short and one sided and unfortunately this happens frequently. However, good matches are amazing and rewarding. I wish there were more games like this out there!			"

												I have never spent so much time on any other game.  It's unique, and it requires learning and teamwork.  It has it's problems, it had many more in the past but it's come a huge way performance wise.  The community b***** oft about this being a broken game, but in it's current state it suffers less plaguing issues than many good multiplayer titles period.  I very highly recommend it if you can take the time to look up things on commanding, listen to good players and just learn.  Check out ensl.org.  That's where the majority of the community is now, and you can sign up for pugs whoever you are and whatever your skill level is.  More balanced games.http://steamcommunity.com/id/savant99/recommended/4920This review is also well worded with strong points for the flip side.  I'm not even a remotely competitive level of player for anything, I just really got into this game none the less.  Read and consider for yourself.

												Natural Selection 2 (NS2) Is a First person shooter real time strategy  (FPSRTS) game (multiplayer only) It is a game designed for the more hardcore gamers and the learning curve of this game is steep,  however, once you get to know the game and how the mechanics work it is one of the most addictive games around. It is updated reguarly There are tutorials in this game that will give you some of the basics but it is a lot to take in and it will take about 20-30 hours of playtime to get the basics in. Not to worry though, there are plenty of rookie's like yourself out there and there are server designed to help out new players. The game requires an up to date computer with a high-end graphics card to play the game in all it's detail, but even with my GTX660 while playable in the highest settings I prefer to set it on low to gain this extra FPS for aiming. If you're a bit of a hardcore gamer this game can be your next addictive game for a long time, but if you're a casual players and don't have much time to invest, this won't be the game for you. Pro's - Great gameplay combo- Good Graphics- Great community- Price, 2,29 when 90% offCons- Steep learning curve- Requires a fast PC with high end Graphics card "

Gameplay is awesome, sound assets are okay.  It's good fun, competitive, but also newbie friendly. Has a great community that are steadily active (so you'll always be able to find a game). It's essentially a game about map / resource control, upgrading / evolution tech research & using various weapons / skills & abilities - it's pretty sweet.As a huge fan of both the original HL1 mod & the indie dev team, I must admit I wasn't too impressed with the initial release due to bugs, performance issues, lack of content & balancing issues - yet true to their word UWE rolled out (& continue to do so) patches / updates & free content, fully addressing my intial concerns. I fully respect UWE approch to the development process where they where open to community suggestions & really made an effort to involve players with the process even from pre-order. If not even pioneering the technique of early-access / beta release with ongoing development.This is a must play for any action FPS fan!			"

												Game seems pretty complicated and time extensive to learn, but it actually isn't, as long as you play as anything but the commander (RTS mode). Community seems more mature and intelligent than you would find in your garden-variety first person shooter, but I only played for a few hours, so could have just lucked out. I've had a lot of fun in this short period of time and I reccommend checking this out if you like co-operative shooters.			"

												Imagine you're wearing a solid-gold astronaut suit while riding a giant robot tyrannosaurus with laser-shooting eyes that's on fire and fist fighting an equally tall robo-Hitler who simultaneously is also using a great white shark as a surfboard riding a tsunami wave of lava from an erupting volcano behind you while champagne falls from the sky like torrential rain and while all this is happening you're getting a sloppy handjob from Emma Watson who's wearing nothing but lingerie made of one-hundred dollar bills and chocolate body paint.This game is absolutely nothing like that, but still awesome.

												OK, So i am editing this after a long hiatus from the game. I have played this game more than most other people.I tried to introduce some new players to the game recently, and i don't believe either were sold on the game, with the main complaints being : ""its hard to aim the guns cause the targets move so fast and are so small."" and ""its hard to understand the strategy in the game, cause its so complicated.""One experience which really led me to the conclusion that the strategy is hard to grasp, is the frequency with which i was the only one on my team who realised we had just lost, or won a game.My opinion is that they released this game too early, at a time where to get decent FPS during combat a PC of ridiculous spec was required, most people had a bad time playing the game at this point.These days, it is well optimised and running on machines that didn't exist when it was released, it is an incredibly smooth play, i get a buttery smooth 144fps.Because this game was released in an unfinished state, MAJOR changes were made to the game after its release, which completely destroyed any chance the game had. The addition of gorge tunnels was particularly irritating to me personally (as it made the teams less diverse).There were other major changes, i have to admit i wasn't a fan of this chopping and changing, because i have put so much time and energy into maximising the efficiency of my strategy, only to have to start over from scratch on the next update.This, was what eventually led me to leave the game, near the introduction of gorge tunnels.After a couple of years break from the game, i have come back. The game is well optimised now, the combat is snappy and enjoyable, the strategy hasn't been messed with. I could play this game, if there were enough other people playing it! This is a VERY GOOD GAME, I don't think there is a skill ceiling for the strategy and combat, if there is, i haven't reached it !This game trains your aim, hearing, and combat sense. After playing in this game, go and play counterstrike and see how much easier the aiming seems.If you like games where you have to have incredible aim, and a deep understanding of strategy, this game is for you! Oh, and also get a microphone, or don't buy the game :)			"

												Natural Selection 2 is a amazing concept and makes for amazing game play especially if you have friends. A lot of people complain about the community being “Too Veteran” or “God-Like” and that makes it hard for new players. I say that this is true, but they can't help it if they have played the game for so long. If you are completely new, I recommend Bot matches against the computer even if others don't recommend itBot matches are not designed to be challenging for veterans, but if you are new they are very helpful. They allow you to explore the games systems and try-out everything. Things that may be too expensive for you to risk buying in a real match in fear of screwing up. The hardest difficulty Bot matches actually are challenging for new players so don't listen to people who say “Playing Bot matches will ruin your skills forever” or stupid comments like that because they are not true.Once you are ready (which can take a load of bot matches to reach), try a easy multilayer match and see how you go. Even if you lose you can learn from the experience.Don't fall into the trap of buying the game, getting really exited, immediately joining a multiplayer match, get totally destroyed by other players and then stop playing the game because its “too hard”. If you are desperate for some multilayer action you can try to create a server (if you know how ;_;) or join a empty server and invite your friends. Really great game! Just don't be surprised about the difficulty level. It is a hard game!			"

												The game was good until UWE got back into developing the game, leaving community developers out of the loop.  With each new patch there would always be bugs, from lag and red plug to hits not registering, and lighting changes making rooms too dark.  Invest resources into helping the community developers work towards making a game that the small gaming community that is left would like to see instead of coming back after years to break the game and the community.

												This is a great game. But the community is dead. You will see less than 50 players on at any time on ALL public servers combined. I would reccomend it on solid graphics and gameplay. But it's so hard to get into a game with decent ping, play with people who will listen to your commander, and not play with a narcisistic smurf. Save your money, because this is a game where you think a bit. And mostly people would rather play a WoW faceroll than be challenged. As a result with no hyperbole this game is effectivly dead.			"

												This is my very first review on Steam and, unfortunately, I will not recommend to buy this game. I purchased the game some time ago but I had problems with my NVidia + Linux combo until a few days ago when I updated my drivers. The first experience of going through a training is pretty OK-ish, but when it comes to the multiplayer, the game can be thrown away.Constant timeout errors prevented me from connecting to ANY of the game servers. I have NEVER had any problems with OTHER online games. This game requires a VERY SPECIAL treatment for the multiplayer to work. I am not kidding here, the official support forum actually has quite a lot of posts on how to tune/configure your routers to be able to play this game. Have you ever seen anything like that? You need to configure your router to be abler to play a game (i.e., to workaround problems of poor software design and implementation of the multiplayer components of the game).Considering that the multiplayer is the main backbone and the main problem of this game, I can say - this game is unplayable. Considering the size of the NS2 dev team (9 ppl), the amount of patches (200+) they delivered on Steam and the fact that the problem is still (after several years) not resolved, I can say - the problem will not be resolved (i.e., it will require resources that the dev team does not have since they already in the maintenance mode and money are not coming anymore).To summarize: the game is broken, dead and abandoned. Do not buy it.			"

												Fun to play, but game quality varies for each server. Commanders are often verbally assulted if they do not play up to par. I would recommend playing as a foot soldier to allow for a more stress free play. If you like RTS games then the commander chair is for you. Be sure to do some research on it before you play, because it can be overwhelming for first or second time commanders. While the first few games can be confusing, once you get the hang of it the game becomes pretty entertaining. Learning the hotkeys for pings and audio chat would be useful as well to ease communication between you and your team. Overall fun game, and can be really fun for a long time.			"

												NS2 is a great game for what it is, but be prepared to; A: have a decent computer to play it on (I recommend a minimum of a 3.6GHz processor, 6gb RAM, and a GeForce 780 2gb or newer; B:  be prepared to spend a fair amount of time overcoming the learning curve.  You will need to practice practice practice if you want to get good, even just playing it 5 hours a week would likely only leave you ""okay"" for a long while.  The game rewards accuracy, twitch reaction speed, strategic playstyles, and teamwork.  With the exception of the twitch reaction speed (I have a fine motor deficit that makes twitch speed hard for me) , I find all of these things to be good things.  You will find the two team types to be fairly well balanced, though at lower skill levels the Aliens may seem a tad more powerful (even then it is by very little, I think I averaged 58/42 Alien/Human when I was learning the ropes), but the humans tend to take a few more games in the higher skill levels (with the midground being fairly well 50/50).  The humans get enough cool weapons and gadgets to let you find a playstyle that fits you (though make sure your Commander knows any specific things you want researched or you may not get your prefered loadout), and the Aliens all play differently from each other with their own set of morphs that serve as battlefield upgrades.The only reasons I would tell someone not to buy this game is if they don't have a beefy enough system to run it properly, the person doesn't like sticking with the team and wants to run off to fight solo (this will almost always end in a quick death for said player), or you just won't be playing regularly enough to grow in skill (you need to have at least 2 hours every week while you are playing, in my opinion, to ensure that you are not stuck being a target to more skilled players all the time).  Other than that, if you like cooporative squad tactical shooters, this is probably going to be right up your alley.			"

												Only fps i have ever put over 100 hoursr in and as you can see that just wasnt enough. What makes this game spical is its asymmetrical nature whilst still remaning balanced. Marine is great if you love your FPS, movement is fluid, weapons excelent and exos great fun. Aliens are what makes this game its own, incredibly fun to play, easy to learn yet hard to master. Buy this game if your over the same old FPS games doing the same old things and are ready to rack up some serious hours. Majority of the community is very welcoming towards newbies and are more than willing to help, but as with all games you can find one or two♥♥♥♥♥♥heads that will remain to be♥♥♥♥♥♥heads. And as far as the reviews saying it is hard to find a game, not once in australia has there been a night where there wasnt at least one full server running.			"

												Pros: Unique ""commander"" position on each team plays the game like an RTS, coordinating attacks and setting things on the map for the team to build while everyone else plays the game like  typical FPS.Cons: Steep learning curve, way too fast movement (you'll get dizzy trying to target someone running circles around you), and frusteratingly short life spans.Other: Requires voice communication with team if you want to play effectively, so you'll want to get a mic, or not, if you're not into that.

												Great on paper but a buggy, glitchy, obtuse and convoluted game overall. What's the point of a shooter if the shooting ain't fun and exciting to begin with? There's barely any satisfactory gun feedback. The enemy animations are risible and the way they attack/charge at you from like 5 meters away it's just silly. NS2 features one of the most unnecessarily intricate level designs I've seen in my entire gaming life for these type of shooters, there's no flow to them, it's a chore to travel back and forth between rooms, it's a labyrinthic mess. The engine, as far as I know, it's not based on UE3 so 'featuring' texture pop-in -that takes even minutes to load- it's even more bizarre. The performance is terrible overall, very unoptimized and it doesn't look that hot to begin with, the pictures are really misleading. Add to that the extremely long, annoying load times -even for a training match with bots-.A shame really, it looked like it could have improved on Aliens vs Predator and delivered what Colonial Marines didn't on the MP aspect. Good thing I got it on a Humble Bundle for cheap. But don't listen to Bixby Snyder, don't buy this even for a dollar!			"

												Counter-Strike meets Starcraft. Marines have ranged weapons, explosives and siege artillery. Aliens have teeth, claws, speed and excessive maneuverability, and range in size from cat to rhinoceros. Marines structures require power to function.Alien structures build on infestation and slowly die when it subsides.Each team has a commander that manages sturctures and upgrades via a top-down view.Natural Selection is the single most thrilling, most competitive first person shooter I have ever played since the release of its Half-Life 1 mod in the mid 2000s. Sure, Battlefield delivers large-scale modern warfare in life-like graphics and SFX, but it fails nonetheless (like any other FPS I could think of) to implement half incredible teamplay potential that Natural Selection does! Basically, you have a team of marines on one side of the map and an alien Hive on the other. The alien Hive is where the eggs spawn, and the aliens will aim to optimally build three or more Hives to unlock all their upgrades and reach full strength. It's up to the marines to eliminate the aliens before the situation spins out of control. The game goes by controlling the map's resource nodes (scattered evenly between the 8-12 rooms that make up each map) in order to unlock higher weapons/lifeforms and upgrades faster, and ultimately kill all the enemy's command structures (the alien Hive or marine Command Center). And what makes it so full of heat is how quickly a single move could change the tide of battle! Both teams have structures made for quick commuting: teleporters for marines and underground tunnels for aliens. If used correctly, your entire team could be in the enemy base in less than 20 seconds. Normally, the marines have to set up and DEFEND teleporters at Hive entrance chokepoints to suffocate the aliens by constantly teleporting in and damaging the Hive while preventing the aliens from scattering all over the map. The aliens on the other hand are better at sneak attacks; eliminating lonely marine resource nodes and setting up ""sneaky tunnels.""When the aliens successfully lay a tunnel to the marine base undetected, their whole team could be in the marine base in less than 15 seconds! And then it's up to the marine commander to trigger the Distress Beacon to teleport all marines back in time or else the base would be overrun. But even when the base is defended successfully, the aliens will usually utilize this mass relocation of the marines to eliminate their structures somewhere else on the map!The aliens also have the choice whether to destroy the marine structures in each room or to aim for the power node, which, once broken, conceals the room in pitch black darkness and disables all marine structures in it. Up until the red emergency lights come online, the only thing any rines in the room can see is whatever crosses the thin strip of flashlight that they have.			"

There are about two servers in this game always full of players  +4 spectators waiting for the next round to join and if you're lucky enough to play inside, you get 999 ping and the game crashes. Other servers are empty and obviously wont start until there are two commanders in both teams so you basically have nothing to do in this game. It's online only team deathmatch where in total there are about 48 players and unstable servers.			"

												By far and away the best multiplayer experience I've ever had for an FPS and its a strategy game!.. The dynamic between commander / marine and aliens is beautifully balanced in this alien vs marine-esk universe. Nothing is more thrilling or terrifying than an alien hunting you down... the organic feel of a human controlled alien that is hunting you online is irreplaceable and at this point in AI technology cannot be replicated.BUY this game, the DEVs have done an outstanding job with it, just as they had done with NS 1. The game gets updated frequently even after 3 years of its release. 9/10 (a 9 only because the learning curve can be discouraging for new people). Otherwise 10/10			"

												Just a few points that keeps me from coming back to the game after playing a lot of hours during the early development and launch when the game felt like a different exprence. Things seemed pretty good at first with matches feeling like a proper match between two groups trying to fight it out for supremacy. This lead to some crazy moments with some teams turtling to draw out the matches, others doing blind rushes to reset another teams upgrades, and other such moments. Over time those moments faded away as the game was pushed more towards the esports scene. During that time you could feel the change in the game, but everything stayed pretty much the same with some games being a quick match with one team dominating while others were as I descirbed before. Now I come back to the game after a long pause due to a friend to find that the community is toxic and the matches have been sped up to crazy speeds. I've jumped in and out of a few matches because even back when they started making huge overhalls you would end up with some teams that just didn't mesh well with one another. All I could ever find is one team always dominating another. On top of that is the toxic community that I mentioned a few sentences back. You can look in the community and see the tip of what I mean with comments like this game not being friendly to noobs or just flat out saying that the vets in the game are aggressive to anyone new. I played a game just the other day with four vets that refused to join a team because of this new mechanic called hive score. I don't even know the details of it. The most that I get from the mechanic is that it is some way to try and rate a player much like the old gear scores that you would see in MMOs. You can take this whole review as me just missing the old days back when there were a larger number of people to play with. It might have been a situation that with that larger number you had a higher chance of ending up with people that wanted to play just to have fun in the game. Now, it's turned into just another arena shooter that attaches a skinner box to give you a reason to play or in some cases as the match from before to not play a match. The game had it's time for new players before becoming what it is now.			"

												This game is a fantastic blend of RTS and FPS with the players choice dictating how they play. The Alien and Marine teams aren't exactly equal as the Marines have more ranged weapons and the Aliens have melee and close ranged attacks along with two or three ranged attacks and also have a greater utilization of the map as they can climb walls and enter vents. The commander plays it like an RTS yet each unit is an actual player. It's a fantastic game that requires some team play and lets you really get invested in each match. You will soon find the team and weapons that suit you and you'll fit comfortabley right into the game. If you ever played Tremulous or Gloom, which are amazing mods based off the same concept as they were the first to try this split team dynamic, then you will certainly enjoy this updated version of the classic style of FPS.

												Natural Selection 2 is a multiplayer based game where 2 teams (Aliens and Marines) must battle it out to best your opponent by evolving the way you play, literally evolving... that’s an actual mechanic... but not like the, it takes millions of years to grow feet because, well you already have them. How does the multiplayer, well, play?It is actually quite a nice blend of strategy and first person carnage, each team has a commander, it’s up to the commander to distribute orders for both buildings and troops and also upgrade their soldiers to be the best they can be in a battle. Now this does take a bit of skill, a dash of map knowledge and a whole heaping of luck, to get a good team of experienced players that is. Sounds a bit intimidating doesn't it, stop being such a baby, there’s a very instructive tutorial you can play through before you jump into the action for both Alien and Marine commanders and also their infantry counterparts.Speaking of the infantry, they're pretty fun to play as also, at first the gameplay will feel a bit hectic, the map is bigger than your usual CoD map and there are a lot of different angles and vents the Alien horde can come at you from but once you gain a bit of map knowledge and you learn the ropes a little you'll be murdering hundreds and hundreds of Aliens that for all we know might just be expressing their need for a cuddle or a wingman to go to the club with... I dunno.The alien infantry isn't that bad either, with a wide variety of Aliens to choose from you'll be spoiled for choice when it comes to evolving you little alien demon. You can either stay as the stock Skulk, a vicious and acrobatic killer with a deadly bite attack and low damage ranged assault that can mark your enemies for your teammates. Or maybe the supportive Gorge who acts as the team medic and can also build great walls of erm... unknown body fluids to block pathways to objectives or to shoehorn your enemy into an ambush... Tactics!Whatever you choose to play you can have a ruddy good time blasting holes in aliens using a variety of weapons and gadgets such as jetpacks and mech suits with big ol' guns on them or on the flips side you could turn into a flying alien or that invisible one or even better the massive rhino/triceratops that makes me cry on the inside. To sum it up, Aliens, Space soldiers, Big guns, Big aliens, decent controls, great gameplay, small learning curve as long as you put the time in and most of all overall fun, fun, fun. "

												Natural Selection 2 is quite a good multiplayer shooter. It mixes elements of FPS along with RTS. The commander is in control of building and supplying the team with health packs, upgrades, and objectives, while the rest of your team makes it all come together. Its quite the thing to behold being the commander and barking orders to your team and watching them all fall in line, leading to victory. Communication is key, as well as skill from your team players. Playing the marines is quite fun, but the aliens is where the game gets really interesting. Fighting as them, or against them is where the game really shines. As a marine, you must always watch your back and listen carefully, for the aliens have the advantage of being able to hide in vents, climb on walls and ceilings, and hide pretty much wherever they can fit. Some of the more deadly evolutions of the aliens can be a pain to deal with. Seeing the infestation spead along the space station is pretty awesome. This game is something you truly must experience. The only thing i can say negative about this game is not enough people play it, which can change depending on how many of you listen to this review and buy this masterpiece.			"

												Natural Selection 2 is everything that makes a shooter great. Never before have I seen an asymmetric shooter that has so much love to detail and balance. It has good variety in weapons and ""enemies"" while making sure there is no such thing as useless equipment. Everything has a use and is viable, be it the starting rifle, the side pistol or the first alien life form. This game promotes and, indeed, needs team play and communication. An absolute fantastic online experience best enjoyed in 7v7 or 8v8 matches so to not lose the tactical feel as well as the importance of every individual involved.However, it is important to say that this game has an incredibly steep learning curve and will take several hours to even get your head around. Especially the role of the commander should not be taken before completely understandly the flow and priorities of matches as well as tactics. I myself have not filled the com station until 40 hours into the game for it is the most stressful and important position in every match. The community is very much aware of this learn curve and is, in general, very eager to explain the many questions beginners might have. And don't shy away from learning the alien side! It is an asymmetric shooter, after all.I can not recommend this game more appart from the dwindling player base as this game continues to age. It is definately my favorite shooter of all times and I really hope this game will see a continuation even though I would be just as happy with just a revival of the once large player base. Giving it a 10 would not suffice. This game has heavily influenced what I expect of online shooters to come.			"

												Never played the original NS1, but one day, i've decided to just buy NS2. Don't know what made me buy it, i just sort of felt the need to do it. And man i'm glad i did it. There is so much stuff going on in this game it's just not possible to write it down in a reasonably short review.It's a blend of FPS and strategy game with great emphasis on team work. Because on your own, you're are a dead man/dead alien. Granted, hours and hours of training will give you a huge edge over new players, but doing it as a team helps even more.There are so many upgrades, different weapons, vehicles, tactics, methods of attacking, methods of coordinating attacks, exploiting environment and different paths, abilities. It's just insane and awesome!One thing that i recommend is that you get yourself a decent headphones with mic. Because the only way to play this game is to hear the team and communicate in real-time. Typing stuff is just too time consuming and clumsy. Keeping team up to date with combat status can often be a matter of win or lose. And don't even think of commanding without a headset. You just need it to do the job right.There is one special thing about this game, while it was made by indie developer, the game apart from occasional balance issues feels like a proper high profile AAA multiplayer game. It just all feels really professional, well executed and polished.Did i mention the graphics look absolutely amazing? It's incredible what kind of graphics engine they developed themselves for this game. I wish they'd sell it to other developers, because the worlds, models, effects and the lighting and shading itself is sometimes so realistic you could almost mistaken it for a photo. I'm not kidding!			"

												Natural Selection 2 is a very fun and highly addictive FPS/RTS, that is practically a combination of Counterstrike and Command & Conquer. There are two teams, the Kharaa and the Marines, who each have a single leading player known as the Commander. The Commander's purpose is to construct and support the team's advance toward the enemy through upgrade researches and structures. The Commander can also ""call-the-shots"" by coming up with strategies for the team, depending on how well they communicate. The other players on the team are the combatants. They are the ones carrying the weapons, making good use of their commander's upgrades and helping to construct structures their commander has placed down. Surprisingly, Natural Selection 2 requires quite a large amount of effort from players in order to effectively defeat the enemy. From my experience, it is near impossible to make every bullet count, or to land every bite into the enemy, despite how effective one would be in a different game, such as Counterstrike. In contrast, the players in NS2 are moving around quickly and constantly in all possible directions, making certain situations very confusing. Nevertheless, practice makes perfect, and the goal of the game is to have fun, not to become the best player the game has. Natural Selection 2 is a great choice for anyone who enjoys alien versus soldier strategy games.			"

Also a time when approaching Doom 3 levels of darkness was totally acceptable and BROWN AND BLOOM hadn't totally caught on yet. It reminds me of a time when steam had a 4 KHz voice codec and nobody gave a♥♥♥♥♥♥even when every other VoIP program of the time had well above 32 KHz. Back when TF2 didn't have any hats, do you remember those times? This feels like those times. And it's a good feel.			"

												Damn solid  multiplayer game. Although the learning curve is pretty tremendous  for what seems to be a simple AVP concept, the reality is that Natural Selection 2 involves requiring strategy that most games do not. Each of the two teams of Aliens and Marines have one commander, a person who assumes a top view of the map and can order his soldiers to go to a certian location, complete an objective, upgrade their armor and weaponry, and build structures to fortify the main base and make their team more powerful. I have found that the community for NS2 is generally helpful to rookies, and most (not all) will give tips and advise to new players struggling with the heavy expectations for a team in the matches that can last upwards of half an hour. Occasionally you witness the gruff veteran who lacks patience for the new recruits, but you can pick up on the game mechanics fairly quickly before they nag at you consistently. The gameplay is solid and balanced, playing as either team is fun and enjoyable. Playing as the vulnerable aliens as you stalk your prey can be exhilierating, but hunting the agile opponets with a pulse rifle can be equally enjoyable. The best game involves high levels of cooperation for all, but when you win, it feels great to have contributed to a team and I think I can say the level of comradery felt between two people is greatest when you squinting in the dimly light power room trying to reconstruct power to get the lights on as knee-high aliens shoot acidic goo at your feet. Fantastic game at any price, and it is gaurenteed to last you quite a while.			"

												On one hand Natural Selection 2 is a fast-paced tactical shooter that relies heavily on teamwork and communication. On the other hand it's an intense asymmetrical real-time strategy game where being able to micromanage your units is just the beginning. These lead to intense gameplay scenarios where every player has a drastic impact on the outcome of the game. Natural Selection 2 represents a unique genre and does so extremely well. You have to try this!			"

												Realy fun game, once you get the hang of it.A match can last from 2 minutes (poor balanced teams) to ~45 minutes (good balanced teams), but stands on an avarage of ~30 minutes per match. Before joining a NS2 match everyone should know that this is no deathmatch or tdm. This game mode is a combination of tactical and strategical gameplay.The key for victory in this game is communication between the team, even if you are a bad shoot.Beeing aware and knowing were and when to go can make the difference between win/loss and kill/death ratio.For my part I enjoy the alien lifeforms most, which rather rely on speed, stealth and clever gameplay with different playstyle.But the Marines do not stand behind with nice gadgets, like jetpacks, flamethrowers or exosuits with miniguns or railguns.But there are some things to learn before anyone can think of having a nice K/D ratio, so I recommend watching some basic tutorials.Even more I recommend using the ingame voice chat to ask questions if you are having difficulty in understandig the game or don't know what to do.The differention of rookie servers(marked green) and experienced servers(marked white) is a nice feature, and asking for help understanding the game is never wrong.

												This game excels at merging the FPS and RTS genres. It is thoroughly enjoyable that also rewards coordination and teamwork. The plentiful maps combined with the role of the commanders make for both interesting and dynamic gameplay. I have only 2 complaints:1. The map can become very busy and ambigious especially when first playing the game.2. Commanders, especially those with German accents tend to shout an awful lot for not following orders. You are a gamer, not Heinz Guderian.			"

												NS2 is a PVP shooter unlike anything you have seen.It doesn't need recoil and spread to make shooting an enjoyable challenge as marine.As Alien you can dodge bullets like neo or stealthily surprise attack an unsuspecting marine from aboveboth sides are a real test of your reflexes and mindplayand if you just want to manage everything you can play Commander, place buildings, unlock weapons and skills: you control how your team should play.Aliens and Marines have dozends of skills and classes that change the way you play dramaticallybecome a swift winged beast or a rhino like killng machine, grab a jetpack and shotgun and never miss a shot in the heat of battle or control a mech walker with huge guns and armor. or just support your team with heals, repairs, constructing or building smaller support structures without needing to command.There are many ways to individualise your playstyleThe game is to this day being patched and balanced by people from the Community, so it is a very bug free and fair experience (if your teams have comparable gameplay experience of course).if you are not sure if the game is for you, you should mark it for later, it has been on -75% sale quite often so far. and cheap keys from sales are being sold on other sites as well.

												Never played the original NS1, but one day, i've decided to just buy NS2. Don't know what made me buy it, i just sort of felt the need to do it. And man i'm glad i did it. There is so much stuff going on in this game it's just not possible to write it down in a reasonably short review.It's a blend of FPS and strategy game with great emphasis on team work. Because on your own, you're are a dead man/dead alien. Granted, hours and hours of training will give you a huge edge over new players, but doing it as a team helps even more.There are so many upgrades, different weapons, vehicles, tactics, methods of attacking, methods of coordinating attacks, exploiting environment and different paths, abilities. It's just insane and awesome!One thing that i recommend is that you get yourself a decent headphones with mic. Because the only way to play this game is to hear the team and communicate in real-time. Typing stuff is just too time consuming and clumsy. Keeping team up to date with combat status can often be a matter of win or lose. And don't even think of commanding without a headset. You just need it to do the job right.There is one special thing about this game, while it was made by indie developer, the game apart from occasional balance issues feels like a proper high profile AAA multiplayer game. It just all feels really professional, well executed and polished.Did i mention the graphics look absolutely amazing? It's incredible what kind of graphics engine they developed themselves for this game. I wish they'd sell it to other developers, because the worlds, models, effects and the lighting and shading itself is sometimes so realistic you could almost mistaken it for a photo. I'm not kidding!			"

												This game is a true competitive FPS. Natural Selection 2 is an extremely underated game. It combines FPS action with RTS elements to make one of the most unique games you'll ever play.  I've sunk in nearly 800 hours so far and I can honestly say every round I have played has been different. Rookies tend to get discouraged at first because of the steep learning curve, but stick with it for a couple of hours and you will NEVER want to play anything remotely similiar to CoD or BF. I could sit here and go on and on about how great this game is and how it deserves much more attention. Instead I will throw a couple of negative things out there to be fair.The optimization is pretty bad. You don't need a super computer to run it or anything. Personally, I play on a three year old laptop. i7 2.3 Ghz8 Gb Ram660M GTXI can still normally run games on at least medium settings, but not Natural Selection 2. Even on mostly low settings, I only average 35 FPS. Another problem seems to be hit registration. There have been many times where I've shot lifeforms point blank (and see alien blood) yet I ended up doing zero damage. Other times, I'm an alien WELL around a corner and I'm still taking bullet damage.Those are my only two complaints. Do they keep me from playing? Obviously not. Is it gamebreaking? No. Should you get this game? No question.			"

												While the community was never titanic in it's size, it remains one of the best games I've ever played.I would recommend if you're reading this and its still the year 2016/first half of 2017 AND you're considering the game: Buy it now. By my estimation half way through 2017 the game's population will reach a level where it will no longer be possible to get a full game server in a local region thus depriving you of the amazing gameplay.Past June 2017 I would check how many people are playing if its sub 50 I would pass on the game unless its like 2$.The sad reality is that this game is dieing in terms of it's population, and it is entirely a multiplayer game. However that does not mean you wont get a good bit of fun out of the game, and its one of those games I'll always reinstall every few months to get a few rounds in.			"

												Not your ordinary FPS shooter.  Team based objective game with a marines vs. aliens shooter theme to it.  Both marines and aliens has a commander who plays in a ""starcraft style RTS"" mode that builds, upgrades structures, and ""micros"" buffs/debuffs to your enemy and teammates.  Every one else plays as a marine or exosuit (mechs) versus different evolution of aliens ranging in support roles to assassin roles.  The game has been updated monthly and shows some response to the community.  Overall, if the support is consistent by ""UWE"" (Unknown Worlds), then the game will surely have a good lifespan for you.  There are a few modded servers that keep the game fresh and a unique game in every game you play.  Some of the negative aspects of the game though are the consistent team stacking, pro players coming into servers just to make the game depressing by steamrolling everyone, and lack of maps.  Pros: Unique style of gameplay, different forms of aliens to experience, coordinated team gameplay, and non mirrored matchup.Cons: One or two sharpshooters on the same team can ruin the game, well played fade or lerk lifeform can carry the entire alien team, balance issues, lack of maps, small community, heavy rookie learning curve.

												yes, yes i do.  like any community, especially a smaller one like this, there are going to be toxic players (and they are infamous) that give the community a bad rap.  and there are many players that are a little too good for the average pub  match, but because the number of servers with active games is so low, it's their only opportunity, and that tends to frustrate newer players that haven't grasped the difficult learning curve, especially on the alien side. but this community is largely a group of dedicated and passionate players that are a joy to play this game with. and yes, we suffer thru lopsided matches (oh it was so stacked that round!), because when you get a really good match and a well-played round, it is so totally awesome that you will suffer thru the drudge yet again in pursuit of that next great round high.  i have played far too much of this game, and i will play far too much more... nuff said			"

												An team based FPS (and an RTS of sorts for your commander) where you fight over terriotry and resources. The game sports one team of human marines who rely heavily on their technoloy and weapons, and another team made of a gaggle of aliens each with their own strenghts and weaknesses and the ability to mutate which can drastically change gameplay. The game has quite the steep learning curve however there are tutorial and the ocmmunity can be very helpful. it stands to mention that the team behind this game has been releasing DLC free of charge and thats something that should be commended.

												This is an amazing  game in every way. If you're willing to invest some time and patience into learning and mastering this unique playstyle and all the different aspects of it, you'll be blown away by the incredible gameplay and fun that's waiting to be had with NS2.The graphics and art are beautiful, sure there are some better looking games out there (not that many) but everything in this game was crafted with attention to detail and immersion. The environments feel ""lived in"" and tell a story. The dynamic lights and assets (such as infestation) will allow you to visually see and feel the progression of a match. You will get fully immersed and invested into each match.Even the best looking games out there do not tell a story with their graphics the way NS2 does. This puts it in a league of its own.See for yourself:http://imgur.com/a/ZP9QV(those screenshots aren't even on the highest settings)The gameplay is demanding and intimidating for newcomers. You might feel disinterested or disconnected from the game at first, simply because you can't contribute much to the experience. This is something you just have to deal with for a few hours. Find good servers with friendly people, ask for advice and listen carefully, let them know you're new and eager to learn.Once you're over that initial hump, you will find yourself in a world with seemingly endless possibilities and strategies. I suggest you make some friends, play with the people you feel comfortable with, join servers and teams with them. A lot of the experience and the fun comes down to working as a team.Hardware requirements:I see a lot of complaints about endless loading times and poor framerates. Alright, this is not THE best engine ever made. But it is FAR from being bad. Let's keep in mind this is an indie game, made by a few people with no budget. Considering that, I think the engine deserves nothing but praise.Yes the loading times are somewhat long and even high end systems can be pushed to their limits, but there are good reasons for that. This is an insanely complex game, to be honest it's more like 2 games wrapped in one!The maps are huge and detailed. All those complex mechanics mentioned above need to be processed in real time. You simply cannot compare the performance to other FPS games, its a whole different beast. Thus the high system load is more than justified.Furthermore, 90% of those complaints are highly exaggerated, these people are either used to cheap CoD like console ports or have hardware that should sit in a history museum.Final words:NS2 comes down to what YOU do with it. It's a lot like giving you the keys to the Lamborghini. You can go and crash it, or learn how to drive it and unleash its full potential.			"

												A very well put together RTS/FPS Hybrid in a sci-fi setting with 3D-printed people, railguns and one hell of a bacterial infection. The game features asymmetrical combat between the more traditional marines who play as you would expect with typical shooter fare such as LMGs (the defauilt gun), shotguns and grenades. Reliant upon squad tactics and logistical support the marines may be more familiar, but require solid aim and awareness.The alien infestation are worlds apart, with a mix of disposable skulks, dog like aliens very similar in play to runner aliens from the early AvP games; through to Fades and Onoses, much more specialised lifeforms that are important to keep alive. The aliens are build around hit an run tactics and guerilla warfare; breaking supply and picking off isolated pockets to keep the marines on the defensive.The RTS aspect is really what makes the game special, there is macro and micro required. Commanders (limited to one lucky person per side) placing Resource Towers to allow marines to get new weapons and upgrades and aliens to evolve, and also being able to provide more direct help to his footsoldiers by dropping medpacks, ammo and scans.The game is very slick without being dumbed down, and is based on team work and strong tactics without being clunky. The game looks beautiful, but that has not been at the expense of gameplay.The one thing I cannot account for is the community, whilst I have had mostly positive experiences the game relies upon teamwork; thus, people not working as part of the team or following the commander's suggestions will be dead weight, something that will get on everybody's nerves. Rokkies are flagged up, and the developers have tried to encourage a forgiving environment, but trust me when I say there is one golden rule...Do as you are asked: you will have a lot more fun that way.

												Natural Selection 2 offers a promising combination of strategy and first-person shooting, but disappointing execution holds it back. It is unquestionably a unique title, but its bar to entry is incredibly high for the average FPS player. For the hardcore strategist, it has its appeal, but its complexity severely limits the enjoyment in matches that aren’t significantly populated by experts at the game.Still, I am sure Natural Selection 2 will gather a group of devoted fans. After all it’s a surprisingly original game.			"

												I don't normally play First Person Shooters, but this is an exception! Natural Selection two is a First Person Shooter/Real Time Strategy game. There are two sides: Aliens and Marines. Both sides have unique elements that separate them from the other faction. Each faction has their own commander. All of the players, aside from the commanders, are essentially playing a FPS. The commanders, however, are playing a RTS. The commander, as the name states, tells the other players what to do. The other players are not forced to do what the commander says, so this is a very team-oriented game. The commander also researches upgrades for the other players and can build structures. Being a commander requires a lot of knowledge about the game, so I wouldn't recommend being the commander until you have at least a general understanding of the game. The goal isn't to get as many kills in a certain period of time; instead, each side needs to destroy the other's base. Most games last 30-50 minutes, and there are no penalties for leaving early. Players can also join a game mid-way through. In my eyes, this is a pro since I don't always have the time to play an entire game.

												This game is my absolute favorite of all time. But first I must warn you that this game have a HIGH learning curve! So please take your time to learn the game. Watch some tutorials. Play some games. Ask for help! I usually view anyone with less than 100 hours as a rookie. But just stay on the green servers for that time. And do not feel discouraged if you don't get many kills in the beginning. This game is not about killing. It's about team work! Once that is said. Then I can only recommend this game. Knowing that it isn't for everyone. But there are many roles that needs to be filled in this game. So there are plenty of room for whatever you like. Buy it. And have fun :) Or work your way up to the competitive players.			"

												Natural Selection 2 is a beautifully designed game, and one of the original reasons why i got into pc gaming. There is so much to offer in this game, beautiful visuals and a overall fun playing experiance. The game can be difficult for new players but it does not take that long to get accustomed to the maps and how to play, being there is a certain amount of strategy involved in this game, you cant just go run around as a lone wolf team work is needed. But overall this game is a large amount of fun and is worth the 6 dollars to buy i would even say its worth it at full price being you can put hundreds of hours into this game and rarely ever get bored. They are also still updating this game adding newer content. Get it when its cheap! :D			"

												ok guysI will explain what's great in this game...Playing aliens is nice and you feel si sneaky&strong against noobs but so weak against experienced players.Playing marins is nice because you are stronger and if you play well alien you farm beginner easier.As commander is also great to learn how each side is good.As alien mother you will conquer ressource points with less dependancies of your imps.As a commander you will need marins to build structures, but they have the early advantage with there massive damage weapons.This game is a good balanced.Graphics are also great.run on Ubuntu ;)			"

												Kinda just my thoughts on the game right now. Gonna try to play it again, havent in probably half a year, but yeah...I love shooters and I love rts games. This game is basically the child of those 2 genres. I like shooters with strange or different movement styles and melee combat, which this game has, but I also like the occasional pew pew rifle or pellet gun.The marines - I think the gun play is great, even if at times you are just gunning down a rhino gorrilla. The meat shots on the shotguns, when you can hit them, feels amazing. Direct hits on smaller aliens with the grenade launcher also gives me an erection. The flamethrower, when you just don't want to aim. And then there are the mech suits, the hulking  pieces of armor that attract...too much attention, even if they can gun down tons of aliens, they can still be overrun. The aliens - I liked starcraft 2, and zerg was my favorite race. These are like them with some changes. Skulks climbing on walls and ceiling waiting to ambush the cautious marine, the gorge just supporting and being cute, the lerk being an annoying birb, the fade drive-bys, and the onos just coming in and killing anything in its path, that is if you stay in its path.This is one game I couldn't play for about 2 years due to the fact my old PC wasn't strong enough, and even when I first played when there wasn't much of a community left, it was still fun. It was probably harder to learn, since most people that still play have played longer than i have, and they are more likely at a higher skill level than I, but I still was able to learn slowly but surely. That is one thing, though, that may shy you away from trying it, but if you are willing to learn the game it will get fun.			"

												Could have been a great game. But the user base got destroyed by making it too complicated in some aspects and too shallow and simple in others. Also the many blowout sales made it near impossible to play it for weeks since the server got flooded with absolutely clueless nubs horribly unbalancing every game. And on the other hand the devs catered only to top and veteran players.So that's what the game is lacking mostly at the moment: balance.And in due time it will lack the other important factor: players.I lovedthis game and it's sad to see it die for no good reason.

												This was a game I was extremely excited about when TotalBiscuit review it with the game developers a few years ago.It was really fun too, for a while.But as time went by, a lot of veteran players started almost bullying new players.It's not a noob friendly game, is what I'm saying.Your teammates are way too bossy at times, nobody lets you do your own thing, do you own decisions.No you have to do what they want you to do.""Don't hang around there. What are you doing that for?""Even on ""Rookie Friendly"" servers you don't get a break.I'm all about being taught, but when I try to learn being a Commander, I don't learn from people calling me ""♥♥♥♥ing Noob Commander"" and countless votes to eject me from Command.Maybe, I had some bad luck a few games, so if you think you can handle stuff like this, then go ahead and buy the game, if you wanted it.Let me just warn other Swedes looking at it, there are very few servers to play on.I saw maybe 4 [Swe] servers up.It's not like Team Fortress, where you click Quick Play and you get sent to a server that works.NS2s ""Quick Join"" option only sends you to your last played server, which it will drop you from if it's full.Again, maybe I had bad luck with my games, if you have a highed stress tolerance, then go for it.It can actually be a fun game when you find the right people to play with.

												If you don't like challenges don't play. The game has a steep learning curve but is worth the wait! Played a lot of different games in the last year. This one was worth the most bang for my buck. With the steep learning curve comes veterans of the game. Usually if you ask for help the will be glad to give it. The community is the main reason I stuck with this game at first (and I had a friend who played).  My personal favorite fps and in my opinion the alien side (which you bite) is more fun that marines. There all sorts of different classes you can choose to play which better suit your style or help your team.  I would rate the game 8.5 or 9  out of 10.			"

												One of the most fun and interesting multiplayer shooters. Oh, and its VERY arcade!The game has two competing sides that play vastly differently, which is something rarely seen in multiplayer games, especially shooters. Playing as aliens is nothing like playing marines. Moreover, commanding makes the game actually a Real Time Strategy with other players as your units! However,  each side is limited to one commander, so if you enjoy NS2 as RTS, then you might have a hard time playing it this way when there are other players who want to be a commander too. Nonetheless, there's a lot to enjoy in this game when played as FPP too. Not only because every unit (as aliens) and every different weapon (as humans) changes the style of the gameplay, but also because the game is quite intense and atmospheric (this is probably the best looking game I have ever seen too!). I highly recommend checking this game to everyone who like multiplayer action games, especially the arcade ones. The only drawbacks I can think of are infuriating loading times. I have never seen a game that would load maps even one third of a time as a NS2 maps load. This is quite annoying.			"

												This game is really different, and really interesting. Take tactical teamplay games like CS. Take futuristic RTS like Starcraft. Take a bit of MOBA games (I know, that does not sound good, but bare with me), a bit of FPS games, a bit of tactical games like Rainbow 6, and put them all together and shake. Yes, there is ALL that. And the thing is, it is done with great honesty, authenticity and seriousness. Developers did it with their heart, you can see it. Now ALL I wish, was that I had free time like when I was younger, that I had all my friends around me in LAN like when WE were younger, and to play for hours on that game. Because then it would be awesome. Without it, meh, it is just ok. But because of that potential that lucky people can exploit if they have time and friends, well, then I DO recommend that game to you, lucky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.			"

												Ok, I enjoyed this game, the learning curve may be steap, but the core game is good. however the community breaks the game, rather then help out a new player they would rather kick him and put someone either from there clan in place. or them selves. the mantality never changes. though. on the other hand if you dont mind being a grunt the entire time you play this game, it is quite fun and as stated before the game is solid. for me personly the cmmunity made this game unplayable, my prefered way of play is in the commander's chair. however you cant learn the game in singleplayer or even with a friend seeing as it is not built let alone fun without a decent sized team. thumbs up on the game mechanic, and thumbs down on the community.

Product received for free
												this game is onestly one of the most amazing team co-oparation games you can buying in 2016, because unlike other types of games, this game doesn't use microtranactions to make money or add a large amount of dlc, instead they use skins, which do no imapact effect on the gameplay (well the Reaper Onons is something you would'nt want to see uncloking right in front of your face!)this game is saidly losing it's players fast and the only main way you can find a full server is by looking for almost full ones or joining other lanuage based servers.mastering the aliens and understanding the commanders on both sides is also just as fun as been two shot via stalkers at the start of the game.this game has a lot more potenial, but the gameplay makes it a bit of a boring game, sure it's fun but over time the only way you can get the most fun out of it is by playing with friends, all on the same server on the same/different teams on a skype call. (also the lack of weapons is annoying, because in the trailer a marine has a grenade launcher attachment on his rilfe, so that makes me think that they need to add more content onto this game, such as turret upgrades, more marine upgrades,more aliens and different hive parts and so much more)but over all i would recomend this game if you like real time games and no recoil gun games or pogostick alien simulators!

However, if you climb over that wall, or power through it, you are rewarded with a game that has all the elements of an epic gaming experience: Team play, Tatics, shooter skill. The fact that the teams are asymetric is an opportunity to master two sides of combat, having that great experience twice. And then there is the commanding position to learn. All these experiences added up make this game on of the best deals on Steam!			"

												I purchased this game back when the mega pack was on sale in November last year. It looked very interesting to play with the fps/rts elements within it. Back THEN I could log-in, load the server list up, pick just about any server I wanted, and then play. Siege was a lot of fun and kept me coming back for a couple of months. However I can't recommend this game I bought less than a year ago because: 1. Player population dropped significantly.                2. 80% of the games servers are completely empty.                3. Nearly every server nowadays is literally in the 200+Ping redzone.                4. They got rid of Siege gamemode and mostly favored making the game more difficult for an already tough game.I enjoyed it greatly, the community at the time was fun to play with. People strategized and worked together at the time, but unfortunately those days are gone.I do hope the server populations increase, the game gets better balanced, and siege comes back. But other than that this game is literally un-playable.			"

												An excellent over-looked and under-appreciated team-based FPS that uniquely combines RTS elements in a way that just works.Think Starship Troopers: The Game. and you're starting to get the idea.Pretty decent mature age community when people are online, and the game has in-built voice chat which everyone tends to use which makes communicating with the team more pleasant than in most games. Usually, you would think joining a voice chat with a group of strangers would be a nightmare - but its actually okay in this game - why I'm not sure.Pick up a copy and tell your friends to as well - get the numbers growing.

												My Experience that sold me:Spawned in as a scrub marine, got told by the Commander to build a ""Resource Tower"" which turned out to be an odd crab-like vibrator portruding from the floor♥♥♥♥♥♥below it. After completing the construction of my new resource thrustmaster 7000 I was then told that I had a Masters Degree in electronic engineering, and proceeded to weld power into the nearest wall-socket.Soon after, the lights came on and I was promptly visited by 6 snarling and chomping alien prairie dogs of death who enjoyed the taste of my soiled space-briefs.I was rebuilt by an odd ""Portal"" like structure on the floor, told to take back the area that *I* lost and hi-ho away I go.I managed to shoot two of the Totally-Not-Space-Hyena's and their fat friend which clearly had dieting issues, before I was greeted by a friendly Robo-Cop rip off. Who proceeded to guide me through the narrow hallways ahead.Not long after building another thrustmaster in a room called Flight Control, my RoboCop suit wielding friend began screaming ""OH NOEZ"" at the top of his lungs and blasting off both of his miniguns. I went over to see what all the fuss was about but I was hastily pounded into molten gravy by what I can only describe as a rather large horny space gorilla.10/10 would be pounded into gravy again.

There is no mode that is fun and well put together. there is no Solid single play mode with options and the multiplayer is burdened by horible pings making the select fue people that actually play this with good pings win constantly. You know when you get hit by an aim botter that kills you instantly before you can react to them well thats what pvp is like in this game eccept its the garbage net code that makes it feel like that. There is about 70 people at most playing this at any one time spread scross aprox 3-4 servers and there usually full so geting into the server that has the best ping for you is usually impossible. also the comunity is toxic, always bickering, arguing, and just being all round jerks.

												One word to describe NS2: unique. So what does it offer?- hybrid FPS/RTS (the only other game I know about that does the same is Nuclear Dawn, but ND has been abandonned    by its devs and is pretty much dead)- two completely different teams with different upgrades, tech trees, weapons, etc. encouraging different strategies- a lot of room for in-depth teamwork- each match is different, even on the same map = high replay value (btw maps are awesome)- unlike most RTS, NS2 allows for surprising comebacks (too many careless mistakes by players with high value classes/equipment can cripple the winning team very hard)- high skill ceiling (play with people of same skill or you'll be frustrated)- constant updatesMany of the old negative reviews do not apply anymore, as the game now puts you against people of same skill. I got this game when it was on sale for 5€, but to be honest even 10€ is a joke. Steam is full of♥♥♥♥♥♥games which are more expensive and don't even get close to the amount of content and replay value that NS2 offers.Don't get confused by the DLC, as I did. NS2 is not pay to win, everything is unlocked in the game. The DLCs are only skins, and most likely they will disappear soon anyways (one already did) due to the new NS2 item store. So expect more customization possibilites in the future. If you think about buying this: do it. There simply is no other game like this.			"

												Its not bad, certainly refreshing to see a bit of RTS added into a FPS. With multiplayer you really do need a good commander on your side otherwise you will lose, its that simple. I came here from an article on PC Gamer - wasn't familiar with the title of the game but me and some friends decided to purchase it cheap and give it a go.Great game for teamwork, and also nice to see that Comms is widely used so you'll find most people are there to help. I did feel Marines were useless until the Jetpack mod upgrade, personally the Aliens feel alot stronger at the start - maybe with the correct commander you can earn the Marine capabilities quicker and turn the battle back around. Was nice to be able to play and will be stored in my steam library for more future plays.			"

												Game used to be extremely fun, but over time it got worse and is dead now. Developers pushed the eSports angle pretty hard with balancing, despite the competitive side of it never getting big. So the game was balanced for 6v6, despite most of the player base being in 24+ player servers. When rounds had teams that where evenly matched, the game was fantastic, your team could snatch victory from the jaws of defeat if played well. The only problem is that happened very little, most matches played where just one sided stomps or had one team voting to surrender within the first 5 minutes of the match. New players are treated poorly in servers and they wouldn't get any help or tips from other people.The developer forums were also a pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ place in general where asking questions about balancing or game development decisions would be met with a passive aggressive ""Thread locked :)"" from moderators.

												I haven't played this for quite some time (A few years maybe?), there have been a number of updates I've not seen. So instead, I'll point to the overall mechanics of the game.Assymetrical gameplay is a very brave thing to attempt in a game, even some games that attempted it (e.g Planetside) later flattened the playing field substantially. Playing as an alien in NS2 is fun, traversing vent systems, clinging to ceilings and pouncing on marines is pretty immersive. It's quite interesting to see gameplay from the perspective of 'the alien menace,' when so many other games are about marines etc. hunting down aliens.Marines... I didn't enjoy them so much for personal reasons. If you wandered too far from your teammates you could be cut down very quickly by an even vaguely coordinated pack of skulks. Also quite immersive in that regard. This isn't really a balance issue, it's more about the ability to cooperate.Some of the issues I've read about in other reviews, such as uncooperative teammates, is unfortunately a common gripe with multiplayer. Unless you play together with a group of friends and use TS, someone is always going to ignore the commander and do what they like.When I played at the time the 'Rookie System' didn't seem to do very much. You could join a server that was 'rookie friendly' and still find players much more experienced than you playing there. At the same time,  no one wanted the responsibility of commanding, but were very good at back-seat commanding if you made a mistake.At the time, there was no tutorial. I imagine that's changed, or at least I would hope. There was a 'tutorial' where you could run around a map and had little hud markers explaining what cysts were, power cells and other upgrade structures, but it didn't really explain HOW to play the game. As a result, I feel a lot of people probably didn't pick up competency very quickly and became disenchanted with it.Lastly, there are a number of negative reviews which mention a toxic community. I haven't really had much experience of this myself, but this is going back years now. You should definitely heed those warnings, they seem fairly consistent. Many also reiterate that the game is dead.To summarise; the gameplay is enjoyable, immersive and an interesting step in game design that hopefully will be used as a reference for how to create assymetrical gameplay enjoyable, in the future. However, the community is apparently a small group full of toxicity, so put on your thick skin.I can only recommend this game to people who could convince maybe 20 people to play it with them occasionally. Otherwise, you will probably be disappointed.			"

												If you start Rocket League, your goal is simple: Get the ball in the other team's goal by bumping it with your car! Everything else is a small accessory to that goal.By comparison, just knowing the basics of Natural Selection 2 is a catacomb of logic. It makes you realize why games like TF2 and even Battlefield now focus on the idea of just having single-objective maps; diverting your focus between the five things going on at any time is often near-impossible. This is combined with very precise control requirements for each of the characters involved. For a marine, a skulk can jump across 30 degrees of your vision in less than half a second, and as any alien, having a constant arena awareness to make use of mobility is an immense challenge.This does two things. The high skill floor causes a massive divide between skill levels. For instance, a bad skulk will get 1 kill in an entire game, and a good skulk will be undefeatable even to basic enemy marines. Second, it causes any team failure to become heavily compounded. If you've played a TF2 game with just one team member AFK, you tend to notice it. In NS2, just having someone not doing 20 things a minute as a commander can screw everyone over.The pressure to perform well moment to moment has, sadly, turned the community pretty sour, much like a game like League of Legends. Even simple failings of the team like failing to act quickly in the face of overwhelming amounts of information (for instance, constant references to named map locations) can cause commanders to exasperate ""Geez, we might as well forfeit, we have NO teamwork going on"". Worse, if the team doesn't vote to concede, a completely lost match will drag on for half an hour with no map change. (Unlike a game like League of Legends, there's just no opportunities for comebacks - the entire resource system of the game encourages the ""rolling wrecking ball"" mentality)Perhaps this game would be fun with months of practice, played solely with players who have similar amounts of experience; but even if you can get that first goal you'd likely just become one of the aforementioned commanders.

												First Person Shooter crossed with an RTS. Marines Vs Aliens in a fight to take out the other's base. Each side is led by a commander who views the game in a Top-Down style RTS view. Their soldiers are controlled by other players in First-Person. Lots of weapons, upgrades, and equipment keep the game interesting depending on which order they are researched by the commander.Each team plays differently, but each also has an incredibly high learning curve. This game is not for the impatient or the lone-wolf. This is a team-based game. Players that don't work together will die, teams that are divided will lose. Coordination, communication, and tactics are far more valuable weapons than any Railgun or Onos.			"

												As a Half-Life fan, I heard of this mod long time ago - but never played it. I bought the new edition last year (mainly to support the developers) and was a bit scared by the fact that they built their own engine. After trying it out I was impressed by the visuals and gameplay, but unhappy with performance and mouse input. Because of that, the game did not draw my attention for too long.Lately, I gave NS2 a second chance and must admit that they put great effort into updates. You can use raw mouse input and the performance has increased dramatically. Furthermore the skill level is quite high (I think there is a competitive scene) and it is really fun to fool around as a total noob on public servers.The aiming skills needed are different (in comparision to e. g. Counter-Strike) because aliens are very fast, can be nearly everywhere and a lot of close combat situations arise. The RTS part of the game (commanding) seems to introduce a lot of cooperation and teamwork even to public servers.There are always full servers and the community is surprisingly friendly (voice communication is quite common). This is a great game, worth to buy even at full price - if you have time to play.			"

Thanks to the variety of maps and the diversity of the gameplay itself it doesn't feel repetitive. Definately recomend it, especially for it's 3 euro price in the sales, it's easily one of the best value for money i have ever bought.			"

												Great game of marines vs. aliens and each side has its own unique feel and strategies to accomplish their goals. Incredibly balanced and very much skill based when it comes to killing and surviving in this game. 1 player on each team also assumes the role of commander and the gameplay changes to a top-down RTS perspective where you can build buildings and certain units for your team while making upgrades. Overall very unique and fun game that really requires teamwork and skill, but the playerbase is very noob-friendly and will answer any questions you may have. 9/10			"

												First Person Shooter crossed with an RTS. Marines Vs Aliens in a fight to take out the other's base. Each side is led by a commander who views the game in a Top-Down style RTS view. Their soldiers are controlled by other players in First-Person. Lots of weapons, upgrades, and equipment keep the game interesting depending on which order they are researched by the commander.Each team plays differently, but each also has an incredibly high learning curve. This game is not for the impatient or the lone-wolf. This is a team-based game. Players that don't work together will die, teams that are divided will lose. Coordination, communication, and tactics are far more valuable weapons than any Railgun or Onos.			"

I am not going to go into detail explaining every element, as that would be like trying to molecular science in a single post, but basically, the game is a team based fps, pitting humans against aliens, in large, well designed maps. Each side has one player who takes on the role of the commander, playing it like an rts, only the units are all players. This game is definitly worth buying, no matter the price.			"

With the constant updates from the developers this game always get's better and better. Not to mention the updates are HUGE and change the game drastically, for the better!

Asymmetric sides, which aren't balanced to perfection but the striking differences creates depth and allows you tatics that just haven't been seen before in games. So the question is do you want a casual experience? If you answered yes, then you should probably go somewhere else.			"

												Re-writing a review to remind everyone how awesome this game is.To those who are going to buy it: no, it is not that kind of a shooter where you get the game basics in an hour after your first launch. No, this is not a game where you will be a all-killing badass as soon as you log in. This game has a very complicated mechanics, with a plenty of stuff to learn and even more stuff to master. Prepare your lips as you will suck a lot. After all those hours played I still die ten times more often than I kill.I love teamwork - this game is unplayable without it. Mosty I play because of the great teamwork.I love tactics - hide or charge that is the question.I love biting stuff - still can't do it properly, but it is fun!I love drama - get lost and hide in a corner hearing enemy steps somewhere aroundI love cute animals - gorges are gorgeous!I love green slmey stuff - you can spread it here!Some people complain that community is awful - it is but only on a newbie's servers. There are a lot of kids and russians. Get used to the game a little and jump to a non-rookie server.			"

Never experienced mic spamming, whining, if enemy gives up the match after it is obvious they lost it, noone rages.Pros: Simple, nice looking, good community, highly moddable game, devs are still expanding the gameCons:(Compared to today's game) Lack of content, no candy systemIf you find the 23€ too much for this game, I recommend you to buy this game on sale.

												Definately not a casual game, it requires some time to learn the mechanics. But when you do, it offers a one-of-a-kind experience due to having/being a human commander. The gameplay on the field is rather versatile as there is a variety of life forms and equipment to chose from. There is a great emphasis on teamplay, so I'd highly recommend playing with a headset. This is by far the game on steam I spent most time on, but for public purposes I have to give it only a 8/10 as it's not easily approachable and requires rather powerful hardware. Still absolutely recommending it, I have yet to find anything that is even remotely compareable in gameplay and feel.			"

												NS2 one of those games where even after hundreds of hours, I feel like I still kind of suck at it - but darn it, I'm still having lots of fun!It is an excellent game - maybe simple in concept, but beautifully executed. The alien side is novel and fascinating, and challenges you to think outside the box with tactics. On the marine side, you feel a hint of horror genre as you attempt to wreak righteous vengeance on the aliens invading your space station. Crucially, this game gets almost every aspect of its game mechanics right, in places where most other FPS-RTS combo games fail. Matches are generally of a satisfying length,  progress and change over time, and have plenty of room for pulling victory out of the jaws (get it?) of defeat when you're on the losing side. Balance, while an issue in every RTS-FPS combo, is better than most in the genre. Asymmetry is utilized to great effect. Teamwork is encouraged by the game mechanics.I do find myself switching to the combat mod at times when I get frustrated by permanently losing high-level characters due to a small mistake - I don't know if the learning curve can be improved or the frustation can be dampened but for now it's just par for the course, and makes it all the more thrilling when you pull off death-defying feats.

												First person shooter with a twist! You can play as the aliens and fight against your opponent using different tactics instead of just running and gunning. Having a good commander is also important, so if you're new then best look up a wiki or youtube video before hoping in, because it's a little complicated. Having a mic and using teamwork is essential to winning, so having awesome gun skill is not really that important. The devs are always working on patches too so I see this game as a must buy if you like multiplayer shooters with a focus on teamwork and strategy.			"

												At 270+ hours and counting, this is one of those rare games of which the metascore does not do justice. This hardcore hybrid of Counterstrike and Starcraft has been progressively upgraded and updated since it's release, and it boasts one of the best game communities around.

												Great game of marines vs. aliens and each side has its own unique feel and strategies to accomplish their goals. Incredibly balanced and very much skill based when it comes to killing and surviving in this game. 1 player on each team also assumes the role of commander and the gameplay changes to a top-down RTS perspective where you can build buildings and certain units for your team while making upgrades. Overall very unique and fun game that really requires teamwork and skill, but the playerbase is very noob-friendly and will answer any questions you may have. 9/10			"

												Re-writing a review to remind everyone how awesome this game is.To those who are going to buy it: no, it is not that kind of a shooter where you get the game basics in an hour after your first launch. No, this is not a game where you will be a all-killing badass as soon as you log in. This game has a very complicated mechanics, with a plenty of stuff to learn and even more stuff to master. Prepare your lips as you will suck a lot. After all those hours played I still die ten times more often than I kill.I love teamwork - this game is unplayable without it. Mosty I play because of the great teamwork.I love tactics - hide or charge that is the question.I love biting stuff - still can't do it properly, but it is fun!I love drama - get lost and hide in a corner hearing enemy steps somewhere aroundI love cute animals - gorges are gorgeous!I love green slmey stuff - you can spread it here!Some people complain that community is awful - it is but only on a newbie's servers. There are a lot of kids and russians. Get used to the game a little and jump to a non-rookie server.			"

												The Half-Life franchise has bought the gaming community many things, setting standards for countless others. Modding has been a big part of the attraction with games like Counter-Strike and Black Mesa spawning from the series. Hidden amongst them was a game by Unknown Worlds called Natural Selection, a cross between FPS and RTS. It was publicly released in late 2002 and was well received.Development of a sequel was announced back in 2006 and Natural Selection 2 was released very recently, keeping all key aspects from the original. The game focuses on two races; The Frontiersmen and the Kharaa.  The Frontiersmen are your classic space marines wielding guns and mechs. Kharaa on the other hand are microscopic life forms that spawn the units.On each team there's a ""Commander"", although slightly different for each team their main duties are coordinating the rest of the team, building structures and for the Kharaa, spreading infestation.As for the FPS elements, playing marine is everything you are used to with any other shooter. There is a ""shop"" system to acquire the new weapons and the mech as you play. The foot soldiers have to physically build the structures the commander plans and thus communication is vital.On the flip side, playing as the aliens is slightly different and more complicated. There are five ""Classes"". Everyone spawns as the basic skulk, a quick dog-like alien capable of climbing on walls and ceilings and being able to utilise ventilation systems as a quick way around the map. Their only form of attack is a bite. Once you have played for a short while you will be able to evolve into the other classes. Gorges are a support class, able to build walls and healing teammates. Then there is the flying Lerk, the stealthy Fade and the enormous Onos. Each have specific abilities such as flight, Blink and Door ramming respectively.The core gameplay is solid, it's heavily teamwork based and it has a good built-in communication system which makes it easy to work together. The engine was built from scratch for this very game and so it works as intended, I notice no bugs during my play time and the teams seem to be well balanced. The Kharaa seem to be more fun to play as but that may just be the greater speed and the unique traits of each evolution.The graphics look great and with a reasonable amount of customisation allowing for lower end computers to run it smoothly. There is a nice little rookie system that tells people that you may be new to the game and might need a little bit of help.It's not all great though, during a routine game playing as the Kharaa, a number of our team decided to leave. At this point, any other game would use matchmaking to fill the gaps however the game was abruptly ended giving an ""Aliens Lose"" message due to our lack of players. Something I wasn't expecting and it made me question the stability of further matches.The levels all seem very similar and finding your way around can be tricky. It's all set inside spaceship type corridors and rooms; I suppose to allow for the infestation spread. I found myself running round with the map overlay on just so I knew where I was going. I mean, It looks nice for spaceship hallways and the spread makes the landscape dynamic, and one I had been playing for a bit the map seemed pretty familiar.The loading may be painfully long but that is an issue that the developers are working on because it is due to a bug, but apart from that, getting into a game is very simple.Overall I really enjoyed the game, and it's something I see myself playing a lot of in the future.

												NS2 is a good old aliens vs humans game, with the aliens being feral creatures that want to spread their hive over the map.  This game involves you and your team trying to kill the other team (duh) while captureing reasource nodes and command stations.  Each team has their players who play in a first person perspective, either be the Marines who use their guns, jetpack, mech suits, or the Kharaa (aliens) with their abilities to run on walls or ceilings, spore rooms, and much more.  Both sides need a comander who plays from a bird's eye view leading the team, building, and reasurching improvements.  Overall this game is about team work and depending on teams, matchs go from 5 min to 45 min.  *Warning this game has a steep learning curve.""			"

												Simply and plainly one of the best FPS/RTS hybrid games available on the market.Where other games of this genre are lacking Natural selection 2 makes up for with unique a symetrical combat versus a vile alien race. Unlike most games of this type fighting against an enemy team of a COMPLETELY different makeup and abilities to your own makes quite interesting and pulse pounding games. Often ending is a very real struggle on both sides with team work, almost inherently making even the most random and public of games competitive.On top of this Natural Selection 2 is one of the few PC games that remains open source, coming with everything from the level designer to a PDF file explaining the dynamics of map making and how to make one that is balanced, the same PDF i assume Unknown worlds gives to their employees. Best of all, the developers take the time to listen to the community, engaging in conversation and discussions daily. In fact, being a player who has been around since early alpha i know a number of features in the game, good features, were designed by players like you are me and implemented with the help of the developers.Natural Selection 2 is a gem for its time, one of the last PC games to still embrace the community as PC games used to do.

												Consistent dev support. Official World Championship on going.All regular updates/new contents (including new maps, new weapons & new skills etc.) are FREE. Except skins & badges you get by donating to the Reinforcement Program, which actually helps a lot for the devs to keep everything else free.Very good visuals, sci-fi weapon & map design. Nice music.1 commander each side. Both human & alien team members play in first person view.No unlockables or progression system. You can play with everything right from the start as long as the commander builts/upgrades it in the match.Steep learning curve for regular FPS players.Could be very slow in every fresh start up (after system memory clean up). And the devs are still working on performance.PS:There's a basic turtorial for commander gameplay.Please be nice & patient to newer players especially when they are trying commander mode. If they're really dragging the whole team down just ask nicely & tell them how to exit the command center.			"

I am not going to go into detail explaining every element, as that would be like trying to molecular science in a single post, but basically, the game is a team based fps, pitting humans against aliens, in large, well designed maps. Each side has one player who takes on the role of the commander, playing it like an rts, only the units are all players. This game is definitly worth buying, no matter the price.			"

This game is a mix of FPS and RTS and does a great job blending these types of gaming. Just play it and you will be in love with this :-)			"

												Natural Selection 2 is a unique FPS and RTS combination type of game. It's a great game that requires RTS strategy in a teamwork FPS game. The graphics are decent but not too important as the game is really fast pace. The game is based on the typical Aliens vs Human fight and teamwork is neccessary. The maps are unique and mods make the gameplay last longer. Over time, resources are earned and can be spent on better weapons and units, which result in satifying kills.

												It's a great FPS-RTS hybrid with unique game mechanics and asymmetric gameplay. One player on each side takes the position of the commander and sees the battlefield like an RTS game. He issues commands and places structures that have to be build an defended by the other players. The other players see the world from the FPS perspective. This isn't CoD or BF! If a team doesn't work together, it usually gets crushed in a few minutes. So you really need to work together since there is no unit that can survive alone! I can't say this often enough! Remember to obey and help your commander and use your voice chat to report enemy movements etc!Playing as a human marine is similar to other shooters save for the team dependency. What really makes this game unique is the alien side. Since this game features asymmetric  gameplay, the developers made sure that the two teams play completely different. The aliens see the world through their mouth, bite and spit at enemies, climb walls, cloak and evolve into oher lifeforms.The game is incredibely fun if you play in a team that works together. Make sure to watch at least this short official tutorial before you start to play:

												It's Natural Selection 2!  If you ever played the predecessor, a mod for Half-Life, then you are familiar with the concept.  It's a blend of some RTS elements into an FPS game, pitting aliens against humans.   As an Alien you can evolve to a number of different species, from flying Lerks to the massive bull-like Onos.   As a human, you're more limited by what your command chair player gives you.  They'll give you objectives for new structures to build, give you weaponry to equip yourself with, and research new tech for your team.The only gripe I have is with the balancing of the two sides, it's been disappointing at times in the beta and retail lifespan.

												I'm a 30+ yr old gamer. I have been through quite a few games and systems in my day. I started on Pong. Fell in love with PC gameing in 1999. This is the most bad♥♥♥♥♥game I have played in a very long time. My first loves were Starcraft and Counterstrike. One of the things I love about this game is that you can jump right in and play with the same advantage as your opponent. You don't have to put in hours upon hours to upgrade your player with traits, guns, etc. All upgrades come in a single game. Everone starts from scratch. This game is intense. Picture this. You're having a nice stroll through crossroads when all of a sudden....BAM... You've just become the meal of a alien skulk (wolf like creature) with the upgraded ability of invisibility (when he's still). Better yet. You are the skulk. I've never seen anything like this game. I absolutely love this it and hope you will bite the bullet and give it a try. Both FPS and RTS elements are integrated. Choose to play whichever way you feel comfortable. I played the original Starcraft when I was younger, then got into FPS like CounterStrike. This game is the best game of all time in my opinion. Before you play, I recommend you watch some tutorial videos on youtube. There are tons. Ask questions while in game. Most people in the community are pretty friendly. Please, buy a freaking microphone. Yes, there are some voice overs that you can choose, but the key to teamwork is communication. Without TEAMWORK, you will not suceed. Above all else, make some gamer friends. This game is where it's at.			"

												I've followed this game since it was a MOD for Halflife 1, and been part of the beta from the start, and this game has a very interesting gameplay which is very beautiful and very dynamic due to the freedom the players have in developing their tactics. Each team has a commander whom handle the team resources, which is used to buy upgrades, buildings and abilities. Teamwork is a must in this game since both soldiers/commander are dependent on each others performance. You might be all hot and cool at shooters, but that doesn't mean you are gona win.So, if you like munching marines or firering at poor aliens in small vents, this is a game for you.			"

												Natural Selection 2 is an awesome cross between FPS and RTS, a RTFPSS if you will.  Each of the sides, Marine and Alien, have a commander that plays the RTS game, putting down buildings, managing upgrades and trying to direct the flow of battle; While all the other players on the team play the actual units.  Resources are harvested from certain points and go to both team resources that the commander spends and personal resources that can be used to buy weapons (for the marines) or evolve into new lifeforms (for the Kharaa).  The marines get the standard guns : starting with the machinegun and can purchase others such as a flamethrower, grenade launcher, welder or the ultimate Exo suit.  The Kharaa start as the skulk, angry little dogs, and can evolve into gorges (support/builder unit), Lerk (flying ranged unit), Fade (teleporting assassin) and finally the tanky Onos (large angry bull).  All in all it is a very fun game, and there is apparently a lot of moddability to the game as well so there is a lot of replay value.  I enjoy the game a lot and definitely recommend it.			"

												Definately not a casual game, it requires some time to learn the mechanics. But when you do, it offers a one-of-a-kind experience due to having/being a human commander. The gameplay on the field is rather versatile as there is a variety of life forms and equipment to chose from. There is a great emphasis on teamplay, so I'd highly recommend playing with a headset. This is by far the game on steam I spent most time on, but for public purposes I have to give it only a 8/10 as it's not easily approachable and requires rather powerful hardware. Still absolutely recommending it, I have yet to find anything that is even remotely compareable in gameplay and feel.			"

Posted: September 29, 2013
												Date of Review: 04.2016Playtime ~600hrs (Actual play time according to Hive Stats)NS2 is a blend of strategy and shooter. I will not say ""unique"", since the word seems overused nowadays. What they tried to implement are two 2 factions that actually have very different playstyles while still staying moderately balanced. It is also uncommon in the way that the development team keeps the game updated and running, partially relying on community effort to do so.Within the game the Marine faction represents the standard FPS gameplay of tactical movement and long range engagements. The Marines move slower through the map, but have a distinctive firepower advantage and can set up outposts a lot more quickly than the aliens. The Marine commander will have to juggle a lot betweeen setting up bases, maintaining resource income and supporting frontline troops. Marine field players will need to coordinate with the commander and each other in order to hold as much ground as they can without spreading their forces too muchThe Alien faction has many lifeforms that have short range attacks and low hitpoints, especially in the beginning of the game. They rely on stealth and synergies between their abilites to ambush and overwhelm marines or sneak behind enemy lines to quickly destroy key structures. The Alien Commander can focus a lot more on supporting his team and can even leave his position in the Hive vacant for some time to assist in attacking or defending. Alien field players need to pick wisely when to invest resources in higher lifeforms and balance between doing the most possible damage and keeping their valuable lifeforms alive.As an advise for new players I recommend to visit servers with a lower playercount first. The game is designed around teams with 6-8 players, which further increases the steep learning curve on some of the high playercount servers. Also, I advise them not to be afraid of trying to play aliens at first. While playing as marine may be more familar to many, there are many things to learn and keep in mind at once that simply do not matter for alien players. Going for a high skill server while learning is okay, however keep in mind that on servers with a high average skill the atmosphere can become a bit competetive.Strenghts: - The game has a strong emphasis on teamplay and tactical gameplay. While personal skill is also important the team with the better coordination, even if it just by a part of the team, can have a big impact on the outcome.- Both sides have a unique feel and playstyle to them, and a variety of weapons to cater to different preferences of playstyle. - A very unique atmosphere that is supported by map design and faction design alike.- Different map designs encourage different approaches in playstyle, both personal and as a team.- The ""community development team"", hired by the developers to maintain the game, produces regular patches in coordination with the community to fix performance and gameplay issues.Weaknesses:- The Netcode could need some serious improvement, with long range weapons facing against short range weapons differences in latency can have a huge negative impact when playing. I recommand searching servers with a latency (ping) of less than 100 (my experience suggests less than 50).- The playerbase is stable, but small. There is a number of well populated servers, however it is possible you come online at a time where all the ""good"" servers are full. With your ping in mind, try out for yourself whether you want to wait for a slot on a server in your region or try your luck on one with a higher latency, or with more/less skilled players than you.- For a new player, the amount of things to learn can be overwhelming at first, especially on marines. There are a number of gameplay mechanics that are not immediately clear to the player and need to be learned. Be not afraid to ask, even if some of the experienced players may sound harsh, there is always someone who will be willing to help.- The same goes for commanding. There is a lot about commanding that is not immediately apparant, so you might not want to try it right off the bat. However, messing around in offline sandbox mode might be good to get an idea of ""what that commander is doing"" while you are out fighting, even if you are not interested in commanding.I recommend NS2 to anyone ready to invest some time into learning the game before actually having fun. There are a few initial hurdles to overcome if you want to play successfully. However once you become more accustumed to the mechanics this game can be fun and challenging to skilled and less skilled players alike. Also, my personal experience with the players in NS2 is that there are quite a few helpful ones that you can get along with very well, although you may need to take the initiative talk to them first. Many players are not used to the amount of communication NS2 requires for both teams, so this factor might also require some effort from the side of the new player.			"

												A very well-made game. It reminds me a lot of Starcraft - particularly the alien side. There's a learning curve, but it isn't too steep - just don't expect to learn all of the mechanics in your first match. The two very different sides makes for some interesting action. Natural Selection's biggest flaw for me is the requirement to play with other people, though admittedly that's a flaw for me of every single multiplayer game out there, so take it from where it is coming. I can't say very much good about the community, as there are a lot of rude people who will waste no time in berating you for making rookie mistakes (despite the fact that you are a rookie as indicated by your name being written in green on the player list) . I personally have a low tolerance for crap like that, but if you can ignore it  and are lucky enough to get involved in balanced matches (without douches) there is some serious fun to be had.			"

												This game is a lot of fun. Its a wonderfull RTS/FPS hybrid, and the gameplay, especially with recent tweaks, is fast paced and exciting. Each team has a different playstyle, and the balance is set up very nicely. To list a few highlights:At the beginning of each round, a player on each team can enter the Command Center (Hive for Aliens) and is granted a top down perspective of the game, just like a standard RTS. The commander places buildings, purchases upgrades, and issues orders, just like an RTS.However, unlike a standard RTS, the units under his command do not have to follow orders, because these units are the other players. The other players play this game like a shooter, spending personal resources gained from building structures, killing enemies, and passively from secured resource points, to buy new weapons and equipment such as grenades for use.The Aliens, however, do not purchase weapons or equipment with their resources. They evolve into other life forms, spawning as the generic Skulk, a fast moving but fragile wolf-like creature, and evolve traits, like enhanced speed, armor, or stealth.One team wins if they destroy all of the other teams Command Posts/Hives.

You even have the option to use an Exosuit as the Marines.I have had many fun times playing this game, and even if you are 100% new, you can have fun experiences being the terrified marine noobie, or just running around chompin on some nerds as a skulk.

												I used to love this game in the last 2 years: but it has become something different.  The game is great but the community suffers from a god complex where the best players on servers believe anyone who hasn't the time or skill they do to master the game are way beneath them and don't deserve to play.The servers and players have gone the way of an elementary school dodgeball game where the fewest hours played gets picked last (literally the players on servers say to wait until you are picked to join a team) and the players riff on you until you are tired of hearing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t from all of them.Honestly, I love the developers and this game but the community has gone to absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥  Unless the developers can do something about the♥♥♥♥♥♥players save your money for something better.TL;DR Love the game but the community has gone the way of Left 4 Dead 2.EDIT: It's been 3 years since I've been playing this game and shuffle helps with the mentality described above but since the community is so small it can suffer from very visible bad eggs.  I have a love hate relationship with this game where it holds a very special place in my heart for games but the community can still occasionally put me off bad enough to drop the game for months.  I still can't help coming back though.Not sure what to say about it.  The community can be great for a majority of the time so most of the time you may not have an issue but those bad nights can be pretty offputting to a new game.			"

												As a Half-Life fan, I heard of this mod long time ago - but never played it. I bought the new edition last year (mainly to support the developers) and was a bit scared by the fact that they built their own engine. After trying it out I was impressed by the visuals and gameplay, but unhappy with performance and mouse input. Because of that, the game did not draw my attention for too long.Lately, I gave NS2 a second chance and must admit that they put great effort into updates. You can use raw mouse input and the performance has increased dramatically. Furthermore the skill level is quite high (I think there is a competitive scene) and it is really fun to fool around as a total noob on public servers.The aiming skills needed are different (in comparision to e. g. Counter-Strike) because aliens are very fast, can be nearly everywhere and a lot of close combat situations arise. The RTS part of the game (commanding) seems to introduce a lot of cooperation and teamwork even to public servers.There are always full servers and the community is surprisingly friendly (voice communication is quite common). This is a great game, worth to buy even at full price - if you have time to play.			"

												Well, in many ways this is a very well thought game. Though it isn't always easily accessible to new players. The maps are really good, but for a new player they are sometimes overwhelming. The little shortcuts for aliens e. g. are hardly noticeble as a marine. Despite that once you've found your way into the game it is really fun and surprisingly unconventional in it's gameplay. Especially as an Alien. I mean, who never wanted to be an awesome alien rhino bashing through some humans and not giving a♥♥♥♥♥♥about their little be-be guns? The community is another point that really makes me wanna play this game. I can't remember to have seen a troll or anyone insulting their teammates or opponents. It feels like most people playing this game are actually mature and (how to game demands, but what doesnt seem to bother children in other games) 18+. So, if you have the motivation to find your way into a great game with an unconventional play-style and a one of the nicest communities I've seen so far, buy it. Maybe wait for sale, if you aren't completely sure, but if you search for mature players, this is the game to buy.Accessibilty: 5/10Gameplay: 8/10Community: 10/10			"

												This is a great game there is a bit of a learning curve at first. Which is why they have the tutorial video links that come up before you even try to join a server. And some people want to ignore it an complain. There are also Rookie friendly servers and they a color coded so you can tell the defference. But once you get a hang of the game it is addicting and fun.			"

												Natural Selection 2 is a unique FPS and RTS combination type of game. It's a great game that requires RTS strategy in a teamwork FPS game. The graphics are decent but not too important as the game is really fast pace. The game is based on the typical Aliens vs Human fight and teamwork is neccessary. The maps are unique and mods make the gameplay last longer. Over time, resources are earned and can be spent on better weapons and units, which result in satifying kills. Victory is satisfying and can be very addicting. Overall, it's a great game to play if you play RTS or FPS pretty often.			"

With the constant updates from the developers this game always get's better and better. Not to mention the updates are HUGE and change the game drastically, for the better!

The game can take a while to get used to but if you stick with it you will find a deeply satisfying FPS with some intrigueing RTS elements.And i can't stress how amazing it feels when you pull off a successful manouvre with your team, bringing you closer to a victory.Every kill feels like you have achieved something, more than i can say for other FPS's, and taking down some of the other teams buildings also feels great. The shooting is tight and satisfying, and the alien combat is far more polished than anything else i've seen like it. This game is what alien colonial marines multiplayer could've beenNot to mention the amazing mods, and extra gamemodes. Grab the game now, it still has an amazing, supportive community and much fun is to be had			"

												This game is fun. Real fun. But it expects a lot out of you, and if you aren't willing to make that investment, then this game just isn't for you.First off, the game has a massive learning curve, and most of the active community left is people who will be significantly higher up the curve than you are. Secondly, the game was developed through a bond between the community and the developer, which means you need to participate in the community to really get enjoyment out of it. A bad server can completely ruin your experience, though they are avoidable to a degree. First and foremost is to make sure you do not become one of the players who makes a server bad. If you have a mic, use it, and if you don't, try to use team chat as much as possible. And when you do this, remember to be friendly, especially to your commander, as they have the most stressful job.The second thing to do is research. Get to know all the mechanics of the game as well as basic strategies and a good group to play with. This last one is very important. There are a few methods commonly used. The first is to just find a server that is well run and become a regular on it. Good servers usually have talkative people who show up around the same time, as well as server mods that ease the balancing and management capabilities. You can find group to play with as well, such as a clan or or just a more casual gathering. With this method you tend to learn just how good each player is, and these groups can self balance when they play together. The other method is pick up games, which are a community run system for playing in a more competitive style. This last method is probably the most rewarding, and sees few completely onesided games, but most of the players are veteran players, so waiting until you have a solid grasp of the game is highly reccomended. Finding a good place to play is a necessity, as when everyone is friendly and having a good time, it doesn't matter so much if every match is a landslide, and that will keep you at it until you become good enough to hold your own in a fight. The community is ultimately what makes this game at its best, and at its worst. Learn to avoid the worse parts of the community, and make sure that you yourself do not become one of the contributors to that part of the community.Lastly, you should make sure you also have the proper hardware for this game. I mentioned earlier the importance of using a mic, and if you are considering getting into this game, then invest in a decent mic as well. Also on the subject of hardware, this game doesn't put much load on your gpu, but does have a massive cpu load, and it may be a good idea to beef up your cpu for this game. You will typically see fps drops toward the end of the game as the cpu needs to handle more and more things happening. It shouldn't be hard to find guides out there specifically for diagnosing what any limiting factors on performance are, as well as figuring out what hardware is reccomended for adequate performance. The only thing worse than finding out you can't play the game unless you upgrade hardware is being one of the people who diagnosed the problem wrong and upgraded a different component than they actually needed.This is a game you can put hundreds, or even thousands of hours into, but then again, it is also a game you kind of need to put that much into to get the fullest experience out of it. I wholeheartedly reccomend it, but I also recognize that not everyone wants to or is able to put that kind of investment into it. For those of you who are willing and able, you will most certainly get your money's worth out of this game. There isn't much else like it, and out of the few other fps/rts games, it clearly stands out for its polish, atmosphere, and community.			"

												Natural Selection 2 is an original and unique multiplayer game, great mix of RTS and FPS genres with a high requirement of teamwork. The opposing sides(Marines and Aliens) are very well balanced, though completely different. If you choose Marines, you will play   generic Team-Based FPS, but if you choose Aliens the game turns 180 degrees and brings you more Stealth/Action mechanics with a different classes. One player from each team taking role as the Commander, he is playing RTS part. He coordinates his team, deploying structures(actually ground troops have to build them), drop supplies and issuing orders; but not to SOME units, like in every RTS games, but to REAL PEOPLE. Yeah, wrap your head around that :) BUT BEWARE of its only and serious FLAW(in my opinion). Natural Selection 2 has ALMOST DEAD playerbase(which consists mostly of the same veteran players with a 1000+hours of play time, but don`t be afraid, there is a Rookie servers for you), for a Multiplayer Team-Based masterpiece, that is...very sad to say the least. Just keep that in mind before you consider to buy it.I recommend this game for its fun-factor and excitement i`ve got, and a mix of several game genres for this price is a great deal. Thanks for your attention and have a good day!			"

Occasionally you hear scurrying behind you, but a stern look and a couple of warning shots keeps the lone spook away. For now. You and Sheckley are in the server room. The commander highlights some blue thing on the wall, and you use your buildy gun thing to build some machine that does something. You aren't sure what. ""Contact!""

												Natural Selection 2 is a near-perfect asymmetrical multiplayer game that integrates the real-time strategy and first-person shooter genres into one package. In Natural Selection 2, there are two teams: the marines, and the aliens. The marines work kind of like your typical first-person shooter. They are, however, led by a commander who can drop health and ammo for the marines as well as placing structures around the map for them to build on their quest for victory. The aliens work a little differently; they tend to fight more effectively in close quarters situations, unlike the marines who can shoot from a distance. The alien players can also evolve into more advanced life forms whom each have their own advantages and disadvantages. Just like the marines, the aliens have a commander. The alien commander works much more independently than the marine commander; however, the alien commander can still provide a lot of support for his team with the structues that he or she builds and the upgrade paths that he or she chooses. The asymmetrical gameplay along with the combination of two outstanding game genres means that there is never really a dull moment, as every match can be interesting in its own way. I definitely recommend that you atleast give Natural Selection 2 a chance.			"

												I've followed this game since it was a MOD for Halflife 1, and been part of the beta from the start, and this game has a very interesting gameplay which is very beautiful and very dynamic due to the freedom the players have in developing their tactics. Each team has a commander whom handle the team resources, which is used to buy upgrades, buildings and abilities. Teamwork is a must in this game since both soldiers/commander are dependent on each others performance. You might be all hot and cool at shooters, but that doesn't mean you are gona win.So, if you like munching marines or firering at poor aliens in small vents, this is a game for you.			"

												This game is simply great.I have played this game solidly for a while and still havent touched the majority of the games complex strategy. The game can take a while to get used to but if you stick with it you will find a deeply satisfying FPS with some intrigueing RTS elements.And i can't stress how amazing it feels when you pull off a successful manouvre with your team, bringing you closer to a victory.Every kill feels like you have achieved something, more than i can say for other FPS's, and taking down some of the other teams buildings also feels great. The shooting is tight and satisfying, and the alien combat is far more polished than anything else i've seen like it. This game is what alien colonial marines multiplayer could've beenNot to mention the amazing mods, and extra gamemodes. Grab the game now, it still has an amazing, supportive community and much fun is to be had			"

												As a Half-Life fan, I heard of this mod long time ago - but never played it. I bought the new edition last year (mainly to support the developers) and was a bit scared by the fact that they built their own engine. After trying it out I was impressed by the visuals and gameplay, but unhappy with performance and mouse input. Because of that, the game did not draw my attention for too long.Lately, I gave NS2 a second chance and must admit that they put great effort into updates. You can use raw mouse input and the performance has increased dramatically. Furthermore the skill level is quite high (I think there is a competitive scene) and it is really fun to fool around as a total noob on public servers.The aiming skills needed are different (in comparision to e. g. Counter-Strike) because aliens are very fast, can be nearly everywhere and a lot of close combat situations arise. The RTS part of the game (commanding) seems to introduce a lot of cooperation and teamwork even to public servers.There are always full servers and the community is surprisingly friendly (voice communication is quite common). This is a great game, worth to buy even at full price - if you have time to play.			"

It is by far my favorite RTS/FPS of all times. This game requires a lot of strategy to win. It requires the team to work together to expand and destroy the opposing team. The game has so many possibly outcomes and things that can be done. There are a lot of different strategies that can be used to win the many different maps and starting points. Overall: Great game! Would definitely recommend for everyone who likes strategy filled FPS. "

												You remember the Alien vs. Predator frenchise back in the day? Before Half Life 2? This is it at it's core. And then, it isn't.Natural Selection 2 is a competitive FPS-RTS mix that features asymmetrical gameplay. A team of Marines is put against a team of aliens that play entirely different while one player of each team serves as an overseeing commander from a top-down perspective. As commander you have to put down buildings like ressource extractors, armories, robotic facilities or buildings that provide upgrades for your little and ever complaining servants. This mode actually plays quite a lot like Starcraft or Command & Conquer for example. At least most of the times. You can even issue specific orders to individual team members. Following these orders and the way they are executing them is completely up them though.While the commander and his skill is certainly critical to the success of your team, the personal skill of every soldier/alien matters almost as equally. But teamplay is objectively the most critical. A team that communicates a steady flow of information is already half way through the match.There is quite a lot of maps shipped with the game and an almost infinite number of custom made maps as well as different game modes. The basic mode though puts you on a map with usually 5 locations where a command terminal or hive can be set up. These are needed for your commander to do his job. If you loose all of your Command terminals / Hives you loose the game. You start with one prebuild at a random location together with your first ressource extractor that provide a slow tick of ressources, both for the commander to spend on buildings, upgrades etc and for every player seperately to spend on personal equipment (Weapons, Armor, perks, ...). In case of the Marines you also start with a single Infantry Portal on which dead marines can respawn. Aliens hatch from eggs that spawn near a Hive at a slow rate.So the immediate goal is to expand to other ressource nodes, build up you base and defend it and eventually destroy the enemie's bases. It's a game about map control like you would expect from a competitive RTS, so usually the team that holds the majority of ressource nodes for an extended period of time wins the game. Usually.So much for the gameplay. What's it mechanically? It's a fast paced shooter that orientates itself along older titles like said Alien vs. Predator, Unreal Tournament, even Counter Strike for a certain degree. Weapons don't nessecarily act realistically. It is more important to keep the cursor on target than it is precisely aim or shoot in bursts to maintain a narrow spread. Aliens regenerate health at a slow rate but marines need medipacks that are dropped by the commander or an armory to get back up to full health. In addition they need a teammate with a welder to fix any armor points lost.So, pretty old school but with an interesting twist and certainly a focus on teamplay.Gameplay mechanics for the commander are deskribed in one word: Starcraft. It's an established formula and it works fine. Hotkeys, hotkeys, hotkeys. Every building and every equipment you may drop as commander is sorted in different categories (basic buildings, advanced buildings, etc.) and mapped to a specific key. (Controls are fully rebindable by the way). That's it. It's pretty easy to pick up although quite hard to be good at.Technically and graphically the game is not really state of the art. It is not an ugly game and the texture quality is reasonably good. Animations work fine although they might look a bit silly from time to time. Where it really shines is it's dense, almost claustrophobic atmosphere and the ammount of adjustable game and graphics options as well as it featuring a good, old fashioned server browser and full mod support.It's a PC game so why would you not want to pick a server based in your country with a low ping instead of being randomly assigned some server at the end of the world where not a single person speaks a language you recognise and you lag yourself through the map? Server browsers are your best friend in any FPS and Natural Selection 2 has one so... go for it.If you like Counter Strike but would like to try something that puts two teams with entirely different strengthes and weaknesses against each other while maintaining a high degree of competitive gameplay then Natural Selection 2 is a thing you will most certainly enjoy.If you already enjoyed it's predecessor or Alien vs. Predator back in the day but the graphics get a bit old for you then this is an absolute no-brainer. Buy it. Love it.One thing to keep in mind though is that the developer pretty much ceased any support and further development to be able to concentrate on their current project. Although there are still frequent content updates and plenty of bugfixes provided by the community team that officially took over and so far the changes that were made by this team improved the game in many aspects.

												Asymetrical multiplayer shooter.One team plays as marines, similar how marines in 'Alien' universe look like, and they prefer ranged frontal combat and their building require powered rooms (with lights) to function.Aliens on the other hand, prefer melee combat and deception to kill the marines, they use guerilla tactics and try to sneak up on marines in order to kill and expand their base around the maps. Later in the game, marines get to unlock big mechs with huge firepower, while aliens can evolve into huge behemoth lifeforms called Onos.You can also play as a commander in both factions, and that gameplay is more like RTS, where you control the expansion of your base.Overall, it's a fun game, there are special server for rookies if you are new.

The last two matches I played we lost because nobody was chatting of talking. I still love the game but it is at its best when you have a good team.

												Quite a fun game. I offers 2 gameplay modes, one is a standard FPS like mode where you play as one of the human squad members, and the other as one of th ealines. Each one of the factions (human/alien) has its own different unit types, and heavy units. The second mode is the commander mode in which only one player plays the game in a top down view, simmilar to Real Time Strategies. The commander can place ""building blueprints"", which then the team can construct, in order to gain additional upgrades (ammo/armor and so forth), There are additional upgrades/buildings that let the teams build/construct their ultimate units - a big mech, and a huge rhino like alien. The commander can also drop ammo and health packs for his troops (if he has enough resources), that aer gained by expansing the team's control over the map and building harvesters. The play style of both aliens and humans are bit diffrent. While the humans favor conventional guns and stationary projectile turrets, the aliens usually domiinate in up close meely combat...and flying units. Overall this game is rather enjoyable, and offers a nice change of pace. If you get bored of the FPS portion, you can play as a commander, and get into the strategic view. The community seems to work rather well together, reminiscent of the old days BF2 (real team play) gameplay, where people support one another, and have helpful roles.			"

												I loved the first natural selection, which was a free-to-play HL1 mod back then. I think I'm starting to love the successor. The developers did a pretty good job overall. The game looks hella great, is just as fun to play as the first one, and the new elements are very well tthought out and really make sense, without overengineering the game. The Commander mode gives the game a very unique aspect and requires good teamwork. There is no comparable multiplayer FPS, as far as I know. I love it.			"

No other game combines fast pace fps, rts and completely diffent teams (aliens vs marines) as well as ns2. In no other game I've played, TEAMWORK is actually that important and actually  plays out like that. Yes the learning curve is steep, but once you get to know the maps and mechanics, this game is simply amazing. Recommend 100%			"

At first the Marines seem more straight forward and the Alien race is a little bit too obscure to seem to be fun. Eventually both sides are fun to play for various reasons.One needs to look up general gameplay mechanics in order understand what things do abd are useful for,  how to react properly etc. Generally the community is nice and the only real downside seems to be lags/glitches with the netcode on bigger servers. A loss brings frustration but when things turn out well, it's a lot of fun with some tactical aspects you wont find in other FPS.			"

												This is probably one of the best shooters on the market at the moment. This is not an arcade style shooter that lets you jump right in and start dominating fools, there is a learning curve! Not only that but the game forces teamplay and communication which is what makes it such a wonderful game to play. Not only is it an FPS but also an RTS should you choose to take on the role of team commander. The visuals are very atmospheric and appealing, the sound is great (especially with a good sound system or set of headphones) and the gunplay is also really good. This game is so under rated as it hasn't had the exposure it truly deserves! This game is deffinitley worth the money at full price let alone when there is a steam deal. This is also an amazing game for playing with friends.			"

												Natural Selection 2 is a fun game. It is an asymmetrical FPS. There are some potitives and negatives to that. On one hand, it is uniquely different. Not like something I've played before. On the other hand, the asymmetry makes it difficult to balance. The marines are your standard FPS type. A human that uses guns. They have technology that helps them against the aliens. Stuff like phase gates, shotguns, and jetpacks.The aliens are the things that throw a wrench in it all. Highly mobile and none of them use guns. The aliens evolve upgrades and evolve into other aliens that suit the job.Some people report poor performance, but it works fine on my machine.I'd recommend picking it up for under $10.I will update this review to be more in-depth at a later time.

												OMG this game is one of the best games i've ever played! It combines perfectly RTS and all good shooters have to got. You can play in many different servers with a lot of players which will be divided in two teams: Marines and Aliens. While one of your teammates (or even you) is the commander, the others have to help him building different tipes of constructions and, of course kill and destroy enemy constructions.What happens if you are getting bored of being the commander? No problem, my friend! You can exit from the commander base whenever you want, and you only have to wait if other mate wants to be the commander. Just follow one rule: There must always be a commander, if not, your team is lost.Bored of being always shooting to little aliens? Then switch side when another round starts.You can decde your side before the game starts so look carefully to the advantages and disadvantages of each one:-Marines have different weapons and upgrades of ther armours and weapons. They can even buy powerfull machines to help them. They are a perfect choice if you prefer a direct stile of shooting and go with your mates to battle.-Aliens have a more stealthy style. They can go by vents and make surprise attacks to alone marines. For this they all have like darkvision and they are very rapid. You can even evolve to different aliens with different tipes of attacks and movement, like fly, climb the walls or go as fast as it looks like you are teleporting yourself!Definitely, Natural Selection 2 is a game that won't disappoint you, and I highly recommend it.

												A visceral and fast paced multiplayer shooter combined with real time strategy make for Natural Selection's strengths. Gameplay involves either being on the ground or in the commander's seat, fusing beautifully the first person shooter and the real time strategy genres.Numerous weapons and classes are available for both the Marines and the Kharaa, this allows for diverse play and keeps the game interesting. From the humble skulk, running on the ceilings and dropping in on unsuspecting victims. To the gargantuan and brutish Onos, smashing everything in it's path and reducing Marine machines to their component parts in seconds. There's a class for all kinds of players on both sides. Want to run around fearing for your life? Stick with your bog-standard infantryman. Want to go crazy and toe-to-toe with an Onos? Get yourself a mech and be feared by the Kharaa.WIth hours of replayability, servers up 24/7, and a well balanced system of play. Natural Selection 2 is by far one of my favourite games of all time. Go ahead, buy it. I'll be waiting on the ceiling round the corner.			"

												You remember the Alien vs. Predator frenchise back in the day? Before Half Life 2? This is it at it's core. And then, it isn't.Natural Selection 2 is a competitive FPS-RTS mix that features asymmetrical gameplay. A team of Marines is put against a team of aliens that play entirely different while one player of each team serves as an overseeing commander from a top-down perspective. As commander you have to put down buildings like ressource extractors, armories, robotic facilities or buildings that provide upgrades for your little and ever complaining servants. This mode actually plays quite a lot like Starcraft or Command & Conquer for example. At least most of the times. You can even issue specific orders to individual team members. Following these orders and the way they are executing them is completely up them though.While the commander and his skill is certainly critical to the success of your team, the personal skill of every soldier/alien matters almost as equally. But teamplay is objectively the most critical. A team that communicates a steady flow of information is already half way through the match.There is quite a lot of maps shipped with the game and an almost infinite number of custom made maps as well as different game modes. The basic mode though puts you on a map with usually 5 locations where a command terminal or hive can be set up. These are needed for your commander to do his job. If you loose all of your Command terminals / Hives you loose the game. You start with one prebuild at a random location together with your first ressource extractor that provide a slow tick of ressources, both for the commander to spend on buildings, upgrades etc and for every player seperately to spend on personal equipment (Weapons, Armor, perks, ...). In case of the Marines you also start with a single Infantry Portal on which dead marines can respawn. Aliens hatch from eggs that spawn near a Hive at a slow rate.So the immediate goal is to expand to other ressource nodes, build up you base and defend it and eventually destroy the enemie's bases. It's a game about map control like you would expect from a competitive RTS, so usually the team that holds the majority of ressource nodes for an extended period of time wins the game. Usually.So much for the gameplay. What's it mechanically? It's a fast paced shooter that orientates itself along older titles like said Alien vs. Predator, Unreal Tournament, even Counter Strike for a certain degree. Weapons don't nessecarily act realistically. It is more important to keep the cursor on target than it is precisely aim or shoot in bursts to maintain a narrow spread. Aliens regenerate health at a slow rate but marines need medipacks that are dropped by the commander or an armory to get back up to full health. In addition they need a teammate with a welder to fix any armor points lost.So, pretty old school but with an interesting twist and certainly a focus on teamplay.Gameplay mechanics for the commander are deskribed in one word: Starcraft. It's an established formula and it works fine. Hotkeys, hotkeys, hotkeys. Every building and every equipment you may drop as commander is sorted in different categories (basic buildings, advanced buildings, etc.) and mapped to a specific key. (Controls are fully rebindable by the way). That's it. It's pretty easy to pick up although quite hard to be good at.Technically and graphically the game is not really state of the art. It is not an ugly game and the texture quality is reasonably good. Animations work fine although they might look a bit silly from time to time. Where it really shines is it's dense, almost claustrophobic atmosphere and the ammount of adjustable game and graphics options as well as it featuring a good, old fashioned server browser and full mod support.It's a PC game so why would you not want to pick a server based in your country with a low ping instead of being randomly assigned some server at the end of the world where not a single person speaks a language you recognise and you lag yourself through the map? Server browsers are your best friend in any FPS and Natural Selection 2 has one so... go for it.If you like Counter Strike but would like to try something that puts two teams with entirely different strengthes and weaknesses against each other while maintaining a high degree of competitive gameplay then Natural Selection 2 is a thing you will most certainly enjoy.If you already enjoyed it's predecessor or Alien vs. Predator back in the day but the graphics get a bit old for you then this is an absolute no-brainer. Buy it. Love it.One thing to keep in mind though is that the developer pretty much ceased any support and further development to be able to concentrate on their current project. Although there are still frequent content updates and plenty of bugfixes provided by the community team that officially took over and so far the changes that were made by this team improved the game in many aspects.

												This game is spectacular. If you could get a group of friends together to play this, it would be fun to no end. Don't let the looks decieve you, this is not your typical first person shooter; the commander plays the game like an RTS, and he has to work closely together with his team to lead to victory.

												Although it may not have the lasting effect of most games nowadays (there's no single player mode) it is rather a lot of fun. Its basically an Aliens Vs Predator clone but has a nice change as one player on either side (the Marines or the Aliens) takes control as the 'Commander' which then gets a RTS top down view of the map as all the other members on the team play a first person shooter.Its not a game for everybody, and its certainly too expensive at £20 but if it comes on the Steam Sale again (I got mine for £1.79) its certainly worth it!

												If you liked the movie Aliens and like games like StarCraft and Doom you'll love this. It's an FPS game with an RTS aspect - there are two teams , aliens and marines. Each team has a ""commander"" who has a StarCraft syle view of the map and can build defensive turrets, resource generators, scanning devices, tunnels and more to aid the FPS viewing team mates who will battle it out vs the enemy commander and troops. The first team to lose all of their base structures loses, it's a fun fast paced MULTIPLAYER game which has a great community 7/10 game, very good.			"

												Natural Selection 2 is really good multiplayer game and I like how the humans and the aliens play differently from eachother and how their tactics are different. The humans or marines, have a more head-on approach and are larger than the aliens. The aliens have a more stealthy strategy being able to cling to walls and go in vents. The one thing I don't like is the lag. It's not ""terrible"", but it's probably just my computer. Great buy overall.			"

												Asymetrical multiplayer shooter.One team plays as marines, similar how marines in 'Alien' universe look like, and they prefer ranged frontal combat and their building require powered rooms (with lights) to function.Aliens on the other hand, prefer melee combat and deception to kill the marines, they use guerilla tactics and try to sneak up on marines in order to kill and expand their base around the maps. Later in the game, marines get to unlock big mechs with huge firepower, while aliens can evolve into huge behemoth lifeforms called Onos.You can also play as a commander in both factions, and that gameplay is more like RTS, where you control the expansion of your base.Overall, it's a fun game, there are special server for rookies if you are new.

The game looks hella great, is just as fun to play as the first one, and the new elements are very well tthought out and really make sense, without overengineering the game.

												Quite a fun game. I offers 2 gameplay modes, one is a standard FPS like mode where you play as one of the human squad members, and the other as one of th ealines. Each one of the factions (human/alien) has its own different unit types, and heavy units. The second mode is the commander mode in which only one player plays the game in a top down view, simmilar to Real Time Strategies. The commander can place ""building blueprints"", which then the team can construct, in order to gain additional upgrades (ammo/armor and so forth), There are additional upgrades/buildings that let the teams build/construct their ultimate units - a big mech, and a huge rhino like alien. The commander can also drop ammo and health packs for his troops (if he has enough resources), that aer gained by expansing the team's control over the map and building harvesters. The play style of both aliens and humans are bit diffrent. While the humans favor conventional guns and stationary projectile turrets, the aliens usually domiinate in up close meely combat...and flying units. Overall this game is rather enjoyable, and offers a nice change of pace. If you get bored of the FPS portion, you can play as a commander, and get into the strategic view. The community seems to work rather well together, reminiscent of the old days BF2 (real team play) gameplay, where people support one another, and have helpful roles.			"

												This is a very fun and addictive game, and the graphics are fantastic. My only problem with it is that there are not many options available to reduce draw times, for lower end PCs like mine, meaning that I rarely get a slightly decent framerate of even 20 frames per second on my machine. I can't complain because the developer's aren't to blame for my PC being terrible, but I would have liked to see more features able to be adjusted like texture quality and geometric complexity, since reducing the triangle count would certainly speed up draw times and make the game a lot more playable for people with less expensive machines like mine. Anyway, with that issue aside, the game is still very impressive and if it's on sale, I'd say go for it if you've got a nice GPU.			"

												Natural Selection 1 is my favorite competitive/cooperative multiplayer shooter of all time. Natural Selection 2 is a fantastic continuation of the franchise. The main draw of the game is that there are two asymmetric teams, the colonial space marines vs. the zerg-like Khara. The space marines have to take locations and fight with the Khara over resource points. Both teams play primarily like most shooters in a first person perspective, however both teams also have a commander who views the map from a top down, RTS-like view. The commander's job is to give his team orders, build various structures, and plan out strategies against the opposing force. This sounds complicated, and initially it is very difficult to play. Natural Selection 2 has a very dedicated, albeit small community who have been playing this game for a long, long time. Therefore they are often a little dickish to newcomers who come into the game, since the weakest link in a chain can cause them all to fail. However, if you make an active effort to learn the mechanics and strategies required, you'll be having a lot of fun working with your team, either setting up ambushes in dark places as the wall-climbing skulk or burning away alien structures with a flamethrower. The team synergy that is capable in this game is the best in any multiplayer game, but due to the complexity and the steep learning curve most people who try out this game never find it.It's a shame that Natural Selection 2 has been operating at a bit of a loss for Unknown Worlds, since a bunch of their keys got stolen and sold on illicit websites. This game goes on sale for $2.99 and was in a couple of Humble Bundles, so it should be pretty darn cheap to purchase. Everyone should at least try it out for that price, and who knows, maybe it'll be your new favorite multiplayer game!Tip for noobs playing as Khara: Go gorge and build/heal everything. Try not to think too much about it. Tip for noobs playing as spess mehrens: Follow large groups of soldiers around and watch your back. Use your flashlight to look into corners/ on the top of doorways where the Khara like to ambush from. Buy a welder when you can and focus on repairing structures/ your teammate's armor.			"

												I used to love this game in the last 2 years: but it has become something different.  The game is great but the community suffers from a god complex where the best players on servers believe anyone who hasn't the time or skill they do to master the game are way beneath them and don't deserve to play.The servers and players have gone the way of an elementary school dodgeball game where the fewest hours played gets picked last (literally the players on servers say to wait until you are picked to join a team) and the players riff on you until you are tired of hearing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t from all of them.Honestly, I love the developers and this game but the community has gone to absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥  Unless the developers can do something about the♥♥♥♥♥♥players save your money for something better.TL;DR Love the game but the community has gone the way of Left 4 Dead 2.EDIT: It's been 3 years since I've been playing this game and shuffle helps with the mentality described above but since the community is so small it can suffer from very visible bad eggs.  I have a love hate relationship with this game where it holds a very special place in my heart for games but the community can still occasionally put me off bad enough to drop the game for months.  I still can't help coming back though.Not sure what to say about it.  The community can be great for a majority of the time so most of the time you may not have an issue but those bad nights can be pretty offputting to a new game.			"

												I really enjoy this game and the way it works. You can play two different games while on the battlefield or in the commander position. It has a complex system of fighting, offering 5 different Alien classes, and a variety of guns from a rifle to a grenade launcher. You even have the option to use an Exosuit as the Marines.I have had many fun times playing this game, and even if you are 100% new, you can have fun experiences being the terrified marine noobie, or just running around chompin on some nerds as a skulk. I feel this game is widely enjoyable to most people, I completely recommend you pick this game up and try it youself!			"

												as a StarCraft player and a FPS lover this game is PERFECT. i absolutly love the comradery in this game. everyone is communicating, calling out shots, and barking orders.a VERY helpful update adding tutorials (finally!) has been added since the last time i played which are so incredibly helpful. also the ability to play vs bots is terrific, expecially when trying to play as the commander because a new commander ruins the game for the rest of the players when playing with real players.if you are looking for an asymmetrical shooter with strong team work and stratigy then this is definatly the game for you.

												This game has been and still is one of my favourite games to play. The idea and the execution really work together and the gameplay is very fun. Sadly the community is slowly getting smaller and smaller. This game does not deserve it, it looks and feels awesome for being a 5 year old game. The small community is what really kills the game for a lot of people and I don't blame them.Overall: This game is a blast to play and I'd recommend it for anyone who likes this style of game. The small community does suck though so keep that in mind of you buy it. I want to give it a higher rating but with the small community it's hard. Overall I'd give this a 8.5/10.			"

												If there was ever a game with potential to become THE new esports title, then NS2. However it couldn't create a hype like csgo and so its a game with a fairly small community.  It is still wonderful to play-as long as your commander doesn't suck. With the recent addition of a marine commander tutorial and the announcement of a tutorial for the alien commander, there will hopefully be more good commanders out there. I would recommend to start on ""rookie only"" community servers so you don't get crushed instantly. All in all this is a very cool game to play, alone or with friends, and I hope the best for NS3.

												There isn't a game out there quite like this. This game mixes the RTS and FPS genres perfectly, and it offers an experience no other game to date has been able to touch. Perhaps best of all, this experience is just $10 away, something most people spend at their favorite burger joint almost daily.Do yourself a favor and buy this game. Don't get discouraged by the learning curve. Watch a few tutorials online, stick with your team mates, and listen to your commander, and you'll have a great time.			"

												Natural Seclection 2 is half First Person Shooter, half stategy game of space marines vs aliens. It really is a unique game because you can become a commander for your team like true real time strategy. However, I recommend that you NEED to wear headphones while playing. The commander and players like to use mics while communicating. So it will be hard to listen if you're just using speackers. Natural Selection 2 focuses on teamwork. So you cannot go guns blazing through the game like callofduty. Otherwise your team will lose altogether. You must trust and follow your commander's orders to win the game.Overall: 8/10The gameplay is one of a kind. You will not find a game like this. It's unique style is worth buying.			"

Playing as the marines is basically a straight forward shooter. Where the game really seperates itself from the pack are playing as the aliens and the surprising amount of team work shown by members of the community playing this game.

I really recommend this to everyone! Most of the people I've played with are very helpful provided that you communicate with the team. Playing with a headset is a must with this game.

												If you're aware of what Natural Selection 1 was you should of already bought NS2.If you're not it's got a learning curve, prepare to be mightly bad at first, marines versus aliens although sometimes your own team is going to be your worst enemy.Small community but a wonderful game inside. The game has a 'hive score' system that works occasionally and when a game is balanced and the scales of defeat and victory swing back and forth you won't find a better FPS/team based/strategy/action/multiplayer game.

												If you've ever thought to yourself when playing an RTS, ""Sometimes I'd just really like to be one of the little minions or badass units engaged in the carnage,"" then this is the game for you.  It has a unique RTS strategy element where one player is the commander, setting goals and researching upgrades, and the rest are foot soldiers carrying out orders and slinging bullets (or slime).  And you can transition between either style seamlessly in the middle of a game too.The game is beautiful, has a pretty good player base, is easy to pop in and out of, and is loads of fun.The only downside is the learning curve, especially for the Aliens, but if you do the tutorials (and maybe a little research on the side, depending on how elite you want to be), you'll be just fine.Enthusiastically recommend this title.  One of the few I've never once regretted spending money on.			"

												Well part of me wants to reccomend it simply because the more players the better. However my game has come into issues (Just me so wont apply to you.) Therefore I havent been able to play it much, although the time I have played has been thoroughly enjoyable. I will warn you if you hate strategy and tatics and listening to teammates then do not get it. however if your looking for a more tatical and in-depth game then I will recommend it.Being australian does not help my liking to the game, theres only 3 servers for AUS. One of which has a password, the second is barely ever available and the third is a blast to play on. When its not full. Because when it is full you have nothing to do but bare with the >200 ping. However there are plenty of EU and US servers on there.If your still unsure, just look at some peoples playtimes :P while you definetly wont be able to get 1000 hours out of it since it isnt as active as it was, for $10 USD its definetely going to be worth the money if you can bare the extremely steep learning curve. Overall I still will recommend it because I go by the logic if I pay $15 AUD for a movie and get 2 hours of enjoyment, if I can get an hour for every $ I spent my money was worthwhile.			"

												Excelent game!It points to the teamwork and without it you are done.Love the fact that you can command, it really gives a whole new prespective and (indescribable) to the game.This is a must have! Either you like FPS or RTS games, it mixes both styles into a single game.Community is awesome.The game is rookie friendly and most times, as soon as you join a server, more experienced players try to help you.I hate when rookies get in Commander though :PThats it.Best regards, Hopsins.

People complain about the lack of variety in the units and I'm sitting there like...""build arena... make different kinds of units you ♥♥♥♥wards. :/""Honestly I can't even think of a serious con about this game. Also the Narrator is not annoying. He stops talking every now and then. It's only when you have quite a bit of objectives that he'll talk often. And even then it's only like five minutes before he talks again. But I wish people still played. I've always wanted to see what multiplayer is like.			"

												This is an awesome action packed game , both sides (marine/aliens) are well balanced and equiped to kill eachother.Keep in mind ti's an older game and the community of NS2 Gamers has shrunk, but still allot of people can be found online at any moment, but it should be more!The big weakness of this game is the fact that each team NEEDS a decent commander to win, and it can take a couple of games before you encounter one. Allot of sad lonely people also constantly complain to these commanders and make it very hard for new commandes to want to continue learning how. It's not easy.That counts for this game in general. It's not easy. You dont get any free kills, you will often end a match with less kills then deaths by far, but if you help your team it will be very satisfying and you will care more about the victory then your score.Allot of players have been playing it for years and they make up the hard core of the online community for this game, most of them are very nice but they can be vary impatient. Allot of them are also insanely good at the game and there will be more then one game when your team is wiped of the field by 3 very experienced players  working together.There's no rewards or badges or ""Good job nerd!"" coming across teh screen but you will feel much more like you did something usefull when your real person commanders pats you on the back for holding off the enemy allone. If you loved COD, you will hate this game.But it if you are up for a challenge, and if you like to take control be sure to try out the commander seat, yopu'll find most people are very patient and jsut want try to win, and some people will ♥♥♥♥♥ constantly but you can mute them or offer them your command seat, most will♥♥♥♥♥♥their pants if they have to command themselves.Buy this game if you like teamwork, strategy, fighting the ods and using your voicecom. You WILL need to TALK to your team.All in All one of the best games i bought on sale ever! "

												Well part of me wants to reccomend it simply because the more players the better. However my game has come into issues (Just me so wont apply to you.) Therefore I havent been able to play it much, although the time I have played has been thoroughly enjoyable. I will warn you if you hate strategy and tatics and listening to teammates then do not get it. however if your looking for a more tatical and in-depth game then I will recommend it.Being australian does not help my liking to the game, theres only 3 servers for AUS. One of which has a password, the second is barely ever available and the third is a blast to play on. When its not full. Because when it is full you have nothing to do but bare with the >200 ping. However there are plenty of EU and US servers on there.If your still unsure, just look at some peoples playtimes :P while you definetly wont be able to get 1000 hours out of it since it isnt as active as it was, for $10 USD its definetely going to be worth the money if you can bare the extremely steep learning curve. Overall I still will recommend it because I go by the logic if I pay $15 AUD for a movie and get 2 hours of enjoyment, if I can get an hour for every $ I spent my money was worthwhile.			"

												Natural Selection 2 is a really good game. It is a MOBA like where the ennemy team has to destroy all of the ennemies command things to win. It is a multiplayer game wich you either play as a marine or an alien. Both teams have a commander that has a top down view, while the other players play in first person. The marine commander supplies the marines with ammo, health packs, weapons , etc and can put infrastructures as an armory, a tech machine thing, ""generators"", etc. While the aliens commander puts dow pods that create infestation ( that is nescessary to build aliens things ) and other structures that inhance aliens stats ( for some ). I tried to describe the better I could but you should look it up on Youtube to have a better look at what it really is.			"

												only recommended for FPS or RTS veteranscommunity is NOT forgivingeveryone who plays has played either since release or the original HL1 modYOU WILL GET DEMOLISHED IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO PLAYhowever, if you are very consistent with your aim, wanting to bhop across that map as an alien, or want to play an RTS where the soldiers are real people, then $10 is an excellent asking price. Coming from someone who has played this since it was in beta, I'm still at the lower end of the skill cieling, and I have only been a commander maybe once or twice the entire time. basically, if you like Counter-strike, half-life, Quake, UT2004, or any other arena fps. Then you will be a great soldier/alienif you prefer Starcraft or anything similar, thjen you should definitely check out being a commander, which is something that we are currently short oflong story short if you have decent aim, a lot of time to practice, and understanding that you will be the only one in the server who dopesnt have over 200 hours of playtime, then i dont know why you're still reading this, as there is probably a server RIGHT NOW that can't start a game because they need a commander "

												Every team combats in a online arena fighting for resources and, ultimately, to wipe the enemy team out. However, not everybody fights with guns and bombs: one player per team will be playing a strategic game, as the commander, leading their team to victory (or defeat).Not an easy game, and for this reason one of the best games out there of the category. A good and solid playerbase, which will be playing this game for long; not because there aren't yet any games which have driven them away, but because this game is pretty unique.			"

												There is no doubt that the game lacks players to play with. However the smaller a community is, the friendlier it is. The game is absolutely amazing in both RTS and FPS aspects. I don't see a reason why so few people are playing it. It's on sale now and you really should try it out. Especially with friends it's honestly one of the best fps games I have ever played.			"

												It's a good blend of RTS and FPS elements, it feels like Aliens vs. Predator 2010 (The game, not the movies) and a good RTS like Command and Conquer (Also, screw you EA Games) had a baby and this was the result.  The game can be buggy and the Skulk (alien that bites you and runs on walls/ceilings) has an issue where the camera still is facing towards the ground (Even when you're sideways) and hard to stay on walls without a decent transition from surfaces and a lack of ""Cling"" to walls, but the biggest issue is the game is a hidden gem, as a multiplayer exclusive game.  So finding matches with decent connections can be trying at times.  However the game makes up for this with good squad combat, Alien agility, both factions playing completely differently including commanders or ""Queens""A major thing to note is DO. NOT. Play. Commander or queens if you're just starting, they have a rediculously steep learning curve compaired to being on the ground.  If you do want to be commander, ensure you have a mic. and your team knows you're new to it as you need to be able to hear a soldier say ""Drop extractor at hub"" and know exactly where to go and what to do.  Generally vets are happy to help new people out and will be a nice guide, giving you build ideas and such. Overall it's worth a shot, and worst case scenario you can get your own server and play with a bunch of friends, although if you're like me and have no friends you're stuck on pubs, but always worth a shot.  It's also got a fair ammount of mods to set the mood!			"

												In my opinion this game just doesn't deliver.While it is really fun to play with its unique game style, amazing graphics and large maps, the problem becomes obvious the second you start the game. Loading time of 4,5 min to start an online match for a game that costs >20$ is just offensive. Another problem is random disconnections and game freezing. I don't know what is the cause of these problems but I really don't care - I paid for the game and for it to work.			"

 4/10 It is with no small amount of regret that I post this review. It is rare that such an interesting premise is presented for a mutliplayer game. The objective is to protect a ship from alien attackers or to infest the ship depending on the side you play (marines or aliens). There seems to be some good elements of gameplay and some varied and iteresting maps.There is a strategy element too this game as well where both sides have a ""comander"" who sees the whole maps and issues orders. Naturally this game seemed appealing.Unfortunately it is, as yet, unfinished. Load times alone make this game almost unplayable and the virtually non-existent multiplayer community make finding a game server with enough people a real challenge.When it is finished, and if it had greater support and a better reception it could become the next multiplayer game on the PC. The premise and the unique gameplay ought to be enough to interest people enough to purchase while it is still in the testing phase of development. It does not come cheap however and is not honestly worth the investment yet. Would I recomend this game?  Yes and no. Yes becasue it is an interesting and unique experience. No because it has no real multiplayer community which it desperately needs and at the moment load times make it almost unplayable.			"

												This game is a great mod dating back to the rise of DOD and CS. The concept is simple, combine RTS with FPS in a way that allows for skill and teamwork to be integrated into the game. Granted all games develop dogma over time, and this one is not different, non the less, there is much about this game that is worth while. It's reintroduction under the new half life 2 engine makes for a stunning acceleration of cybergaming. The artistiry and graphical display as well as game design and team balancing that the game designers have put into this game is remarable. The use of a voice  program embeded into the game is a nice side feature so you don't have to rent a teamspeak server or some such. In general it is a stylish game, with hip art, a sleak premis and plenty of fun.			"

												Natural selection 2 is great fun, coupled with strategy that makes the game something completely unique, having top down commander view and first person view the way it does is something I seldom see in games and I enjoy every second of it, the game itself is easy to learn but hard to master with all of the varying weapons and classes there is alot to love. the environments are detailed and entertaining as well and the mechanics just work. I strongly recommend you try the game there is alot of fun to be had, whether you're an alien or a marine.			"

												So here's the story: Got super excited when I found an Aliens VS Humans game(been looking for a tactical one like this for a LONG time), so I bought it for 10 USD.Started it up after installing: takes about 10 minutes to start up--and that's just the loading screen. No joke. I'm thinking, ""Oh, maybe it just needs to load the files for the first time."" Yeah I was wrong.Get to the menu, and I'm getting 7 FPS. Why? I've got over the system requirements and I'm running 7 FPS on medium settings, wth? Turn all the settings down to low, 720p resolution: get 15 FPS.Go to server browser and see if it's any better(by that I mean maybe it'll run faster in game). Find a server, try to connect to it. It's not full, and it's not connecting. Thought maybe a lot of stuff was happening in the server so it needed to process and load it all; nope. Wait about 5 mins and I close it out. Go to another server and try to connect, nope, after 5 mins again, I'm stuck on the dang loading screen.Finally decide to try the quick game option, and asks me if I want a tutorial. Hadn't ever played, so I clicked yes. And it takes around 10 mins to load...AGAIN. After it loads it's running 17 FPS(btw I have my Steam settings so I can see my FPS in game)...on lowest settings. My gosh...talk about not being optimized. So I start to hear the narrator and this is what immediately comes to mind after he's done speaking:'Background noise in the recording, you can hear the click to stop the audio from recording at the end, and there's a lot of static and it ends like it cut off; because there's not background noise in the game.' Can't believe that was the final audio recording for that, I have audacity(a free audio recording/editing program) with a $40 headset that sounds 10x better than this. I record it, if there's background noise I remove it ENTIRELY, and I have a cardboard box for my ""professional"" recording. Like really, this is the best you get when you release the game? That's one of the worst audio recordings I've ever heard in a game, it's rushed; unfinished and could have of been better made if you took your time.Enough about the audio rant, next, it tells me to build an armory, then kill some enemies. I start shooting the enemy(let's just call it an alien rat, first glance that's what I thought it was), and guess what happens? I drop half of my 17 FPS while fighting. I don't know why. I go back into my graphics settings after killing the alien rat and make sure everything is down, and turn the resolution down to the lowest. I decide to see what would happen if I turn up the quality on some things, because in some games it happens to run faster on higher settings; don't ask why, but they do. Anyways I literally JUST click the little arrow so that the texture quality is medium, and what happens next? Drop half of my 17 FPS again?, no. Increased FPS?, no. All of the dang HUD disappears off my screen. Nothing at all. No text for the settings menu, and no HUD whatsoever in game. Wth? I click the left arrow(arrow that decreases the quality) on the button-area I had clicked, and nothing happens. I hit apply: nothing. Not a single text is on my screen. Empty rectangles and empty boxes. I proceed to close out the menu and reopen it to see if it was glitched for a second. *sigh*...This keeps getting better and better, doesn't it? After I close the menu again my game freezes...comepletely freezes. It's sound is looping and locking at a certain point(that indicating it's completely frozen), I open task manager to close the process...and I don't see it. Because of course, the stupid application is covering my desktop and I'm blind to everything there. I tried for 3 minutes to get the stupid task manager to work, finally I found an option where I can ""move"" it by right clicking on its icon on the Windows bar. Move it over to my second monitor, and close out the application.TL;DR: Game froze, HUD disappeared, terribly optimized, bad experience. Had high hopes that I could play this but NOPE! I'm also REALLY ticked off that I'm above the recommended requirements, and that the requirements lied to us. I should be able to get a solid 30 FPS on min requirements on the lowest settings AT LEAST. NOPE! Bad game, uninstalling and not playing again.			"

Two games right after each other the commander left, after this your team is crippled and can only last one more minute if you're lucky. A simple fix could be a AI controlled commander if the player commander leaves during the game.			"

												This is a game I'd really like to like. I enjoyed the original mod, and I'm a big supporter of the idea of asymmetric gameplay in multiplayer FPS. Unfortunately, the netcode for this game is god-awful in anything but LAN play. You frequently have situations as an alien where you're sitting behind a wall, or a box---not in combat and you find yourself suddenly a corpse. You hear and see maybe 10 gunshots after the fact hitting your body. (happens with as low as 20-40 ping, with a decent server) It sounds like the beginning of a Kafka novel rather than any sort of fun. In combat, as an alien (but also happens -admittedly not as frequently- as the slower Marines) it seems as if you've been afflicted by some sort of invisible alien centipede tail trailing seconds behind that your enemy can shoot to kill you despite you already being safe and well away on your screen. It's strange that players find public-competitive gameplay even remotely enjoyable under these circumstances.gameplay-8/10graphics-7/10netcode written by australian lowlands gorilla-1/10 "

												A standalone sequel a great Half-Life 1 mod, Natural Selection 2 is a triumph, and it's actually a bit amazing it exists at all. The game is an assymetical team based first person shooter, with one player on each team acting as its commander and playing the game like a traditional real time strategy game. The Human Marine side is fairly standard FPS fare (though still incredibly fun), while the Aliens play very uniquely, with different species to mutate into, and a whole host of bizarre abilities to unlock.The game runs on its own graphics engine, which looks incredible, and has been gradually optimized over the years so the initial limitations on running the game well seem to be largely resolved. The art and sound design of the maps give off an amazing industrial sci-fi vibe; this is a far more faithful game to the movie Aliens, which the game freely draws inspiration from, than the dreadful Colonial Marines cash-in.|My only criticism, aside from the occassional crash and perfomance issues, is that the game can be difficult to jump into and understand what is going on, what you need to do, and even what your role is, even as a basic Marine grunt. It's particularly difficult if you choose to play as the commander, though once you figure out some good strategies and tactics, have a solid skilled team that obeys orders, and you learn to effectively communicate, it can be the most rewarding way to play. It's also important to know that there is a dedicated fanbase of competitive players who take NS2 a bit seriously, so if that is not what you are looking for, make sure to only visit the casual servers for a while (the servers tend to helpfully label themselves as such).Recommended for those who like team based shooters, those with unique and assymetrical combat, sci-fi fans, and even strategy fans. If one or more of those things describes you, this game is worth it, even at full retail.			"

												I'm not gonna lie, this game was fantastic, and when it was I got about 50 hours of fun out of it making it well worth the purchase, but now one downside is basically killing it. Lack of public servers to play on and people to play with.Back when this game started out, it was awesome, you could always find a server to play on that was populated with a bunch of people (I believe there were even some official servers, what ever happened to those?), back in those days anyone could enjoy this game for all it's worth.Now, my server browser can hardly find any servers most of the time, I'm lucky if it finds 3 within my ping range (which I set to a generous 100ms, don't want much higher than that in a shooter do we?), and I need to be lucky twice because chances are these servers are either full or empty,It happens that you find a good server to play on and you can play and play for hours with lots of people and have loads of fun, but you can't just pick up the game and play with the state of things being like this. I could always use the 'play now' featurewhich automatically finds a server for you but this would mean playing with♥♥♥♥♥♥latency and that dampens the fun quite a bit.Besides this glaring issue, tha the game basically feels like it's dying... The game is actually amazing, it's one of the most fun shooters I've ever played. There are two teams, Aliens and (space)Marines one player on each team has to be the commander, for this player the game is an RTS game, their job is to build bases and oversee and direct the rest of the players on their team to victory, the rest of the players are either marines or aliens, playing as marines and playing as aliens is a very different experience (no matter if you're the commander or a regular player)For the commander, the difference is of course the types of structures available and the pre-requisites for these structures to work. For marines a power generator needs to be built and kept online for structures in a room to operate, for Aliens cysts need to be built in the room to spread 'infestation' around it in order for you to be able to build in it. An alien commander can build without the help of his teammates as long as his teammates secure locations and keep the enemies out (or just busy), meanwhile the Marine commander needs other players to build his structures for him and has to order them to build for him. He can later build bots to do this for him but they are slow moving and come at a price.As for the infantry of both teams, the marines evolve by upgrading their weapons for example by buying shotguns or flamethrowers, later in the game their most elite technology is the exosuit, works kinda like the ones in the matrix.Aliens have a much more complex progression, aliens evolve by actually evolving, they all start as a 'skulk' which is the basic footsoldier which runs around and bites people's heels, from there they can turn into a gorge (support unit that can help the commander build and heal other units), a lerk (a pterodactyl with ranged attacks), Fade which is a humanoid stealth assassination unit that can deal lots of damage but only from melee range, and finally Onos to compete with the exosuit (it's basically a Triceratops that runs around and bashes things real violently).And that's about it, most of the game will be fought to control resource extraction points and base locations until one team manages to take over all the base locations exterminating all the opposing team's command centers/hives, both teams start with one command center/hive, they can build more in specific areas on the map and they have to contest each other for these areas. Once built, even if you lose your starting base you still haven't lost because you can run over to your alternate base and retake command from there.This game seamlessly blends strategy and tactics in a unique way, and I really really wish I could give it a thumbs up because of how great the game itself is, but no matter how great the game is, it doesn't really matter much if I can't really play it unless I have a private server and about 20 friends to join me. When you're hosting a server, you're lucky to get players. When you're playing, you're lucky to find a server, it's a hellish loop that no one enjoys. But I do sincerely hope that the developers will not give up on this game, find a solution to this problem before you make Natural Selection 3, and I will definitely buy that one too. If they are indeed developing Natural Selection 3 anytime soon then I hope they will also make commanding easier to do, the micro-management needed to command well in this game is nuts.			"

												I'm afraid I'll have to throw my lot in with the Nays this time. Fans of the first installment might find something here to scratch an old itch, but unfortunately the satisfying elements have all been rendered down and reimagined into a thin gruel in the name of having a saleable second entry. Useless gameplay features have been added for no apparent reason, such as the power node system. The Alien tech tree has been completely overhauled, and brings you an alien commander, which has gone through varying degrees of uselessness and boring gameplay over the various patches. Relocating the marine base is a thing of the past, as you now have tech points to capture that unlock parts of the tech tree. Gone are the days of the heavy/welder train, the OC farms outside 'rine spawn, trying to siege a hive before xeno gets unlocked...There is some fun to be had here, for sure. Newer comers to the genre will doubtless find the commander mechanic new and engaging, and the differences between the aliens and marines is a fresh breath of air in the standard rote of FPS gameplay. The game looks sharp, and running on walls and cielings as an alien is second to none. Unfortunately with the glaring technical issues NS2 launched with, by the time the game was playable, there was no one left to play it with. Pick this game up on sale if you're interested - $25 is too steep by half.			"

												This was a fun game until the devs changed their in-game browser specifically to steer players away from a particular player-owned and run set of servers that were more popular then the servers that they prefer. Absolutely rediculous. Especially when you consider that Natural Selection as an IP started out as a mod itself. Now a game that only ever has a few hundred people playing it now has a fairly large percentage of its player base sequested off of the main server list. And if the devs will blatently surpress one community, who knows what they'll do to the next bunch of servers that they decide they don't like.			"

But once you are ""in it"", it's hard to stop playing. Each game is different due to other commanders, spawn points and tactics. I recommend everyone to practice this game and start playing competitively. The difference between public games and competitive matches is huge. 6vs6 with a decent commander and playing as a team is a great experience.			"

												i really can't believe the devs behind this game actually made this work. I mean, a RTS + FPS combined into one game is kinda hard.however, this game suffers from very poor performance issues, i can only play this game with an acceptable fps if I turn everything down to absolute minimum setting (i5 2500k, 560ti). The performance increased after a recent patch but still is not as good as I'd like it to be.Another problem with this game is the shooting mechanic. Sustained firing slows down your character significantly which really is not fair considering how fast the aliens move in this game. They also had a problem with mouse acceleration but it was complete removed with a recent patch and now aiming is A LOT better, this really is a big plus for me.The problem with a RTS style ""commander"" system is that it's really hard (in pubs at least) to find a competent player to play the commander role who has really good situational awareness to drop ammo/medkit for players on the team while at the same time good at knowing when and what to upgrade (armor, guns).The best part about this game is probably the developer team behind it. They are really invested in the game, always try their best to talk to and listen to the community and they actually play the game in their free time with the community lol. Basically you get the feeling they really do care about it and want this game to succeed.Overall I recommand this game, but just keep in  mind that it's not everyday you meet a capable ""commander"" who can guide your team to a win. So don't be all mad when you loose, it's normal lol.Edit: oh i hope this game becomes a more popular professional competitive game like CS. because this really is a very team-oriented competitive game.

												Natural Selection 2 is the decendant of one of the most popular old HL1 mods. It pits aliens versus marines in an epic fps that involves strategy and overall skill. You need to build bases and destroy the oppsing teams bases and upgrade the unit your playing with along the way. this game might seem hard when you start out but its the most fun you can have and the community is very friendly and helpfull! if you like aliens and the idea of being an alien this game is a must!

												i really can't believe the devs behind this game actually made this work. I mean, a RTS + FPS combined into one game is kinda hard.however, this game suffers from very poor performance issues, i can only play this game with an acceptable fps if I turn everything down to absolute minimum setting (i5 2500k, 560ti). The performance increased after a recent patch but still is not as good as I'd like it to be.Another problem with this game is the shooting mechanic. Sustained firing slows down your character significantly which really is not fair considering how fast the aliens move in this game.

												Natural Selection 2 is so far my best experience concerning multiplayer games. Basically it combines strategy and ego shooter in one exiting game. In average a game lasts between 5 and 60 min and especially good teamplay is required. After about 300 hours of fun, I really recommend this game to all gamers looking for a top class ground-breaking and fun teamplay-RTS-Shooter. Finally I want to point out the great philosophy of the independent developer/community unknown worlds entertainment. I mean 20 bugs and frequent updates for free and everyone? Awesome.So ... have fun.Greetings and always remember: rage-quitting is a crime! ;)			"

												This game manages to blend the shooter and the strategy genres into one fun game. It is extremely satisfying when your team starts to pull together and outmatch the enemy team in upgrades, map control, or just plain coordination. This game is not for people who like to be lone wolves. If you do not work with your team, you will die. That is a simple truth of the game and one of the main reasons why I like the game so much.However, there is not always an active server to join. Sometimes I have had trouble finding a server that had an open slot or a good amount of people in it. When I do find a server though, the experience is incredibly fun and I am glad that I bought the game. (It is not too hard to find an active server most of the time)Overall, if you like strategic shooters or want to feel like a real colonial marine, get the game.P.S. It is a hell of a lot better than Aliens: Colonial Marines and it does what that game should have done!			"

												I really tried to give this game a chance... 3 times...., I participated in 2 free weekends and both times the game ran terribly, long waiting times and 10fps in action while having the RECOMMENDED specs.Now, at the recomendation of some people saying that it had the performance issues fixed... I bought it, but to be dissapointed once again, it still runs bad.I tried with all settings on low along with all renders (OGL, D9, D10), even the lowest possible resolution that also makes the HUD indescribeable, none of these settings help with the actual in-game performance.And I have 95 FPS in the menu (D3D9, with OpenGL I have 45) and 60+ in the spectator room, but when a marine starts shooting at me, 10 frames, that's just great.The gameplay might be nice, but I wouldn't know since I can't really play it, and to top the FPS issues, I also have crashes which is another 5-minute loading screen.So, I am sorry, but I can't recommend a game that runs like that on hardware specified in the recommended specs, pump up the specs in the description since it's false advertising or fix the performance ! I prefer fixing it because that would enable me to play and reconsider the game.			"

												NS2 is such a great game, however I am very worried about the lack of players. The game cannot attract new players well because rookies are scared away from the non-traditional style of play. The extreme necessity for working as a team, and the non-traditional combat seems to scare away potential players. The learning curve is so high, yet shadows a wonderful and unique game that has the guts to break all the rules of FPS, and does so in a beutiful and fun way.			"

It takes time to learn the maps and the game play but when you manage to do it unmute those toxic asses and barf on them on how bad they are at everything on life! and have a great time!			"

												Neat mod made into a neat game. Only played a very small bit, but a fan for shooters and arcade-style creature combat alike. Some unique attributes and mechanics make this a standout title, so if you like things along the lines of Aliens or Event Horizon made into an alien/spase mareens shooter, go for it, it's well-built.

Still, the game needs more development.			"

												Game is fine, yet the community is the biggest pile of cancer since ♥♥♥♥♥. Not the funny kind of cancer, the cancer kind of  cancer.If you're new, you'll regret it as this ""community"" will abuse and attack you many times as i have seen before. Even if you have a couple hundred hours such as me and are pretty good at the game, the ""uber elites"" will still become enraged if you even dare to com or not do as they say.The amount of times in a match no one wants to com and i take upon the task and we actually come close to winning the game (phase gates outside hive room or entire map controlled) and one uber elite joins and urges the team to kick you even though you've done a terrific job is way too damn high.Sadly the game has payed the price of the devs letting this game die to lack of updates and the cancerous community as it barely sees 8 servers active, you'll be lucky to find a spot on a server with ping below 150 as most servers are hosted in the US or Russia. If the devs didnt leave this game to rot for nearly 2 years then we probably wouldnt have this. Luckily for us, the devs have finally returned and have promised updates in the future, and we'll hopefully get a mega update with a free-weekend included to finally bring life to this age old classic.I may change this review in the future, but as it stands this game is beyond recognition of what it used to be as the devs squandared money in wasted E-Sports tournaments, 90% of the playerbase are facists, there's a few hackers here and there and we havent seen an actual update in 2+ years.

Badly. And leaving a negative review of the game because of the low player count certainly won't help it improve.So I do highly suggest you buy this game. But still try to avoid the veteran players because they will♥♥♥♥♥♥all over you for being a rookie. You may have to play in rookie servers where you don't get great ping until the player count rises (if it rises).Hopefully a well timed free weekend will help.			"

												Okay. Like the Alien Trilogy? Like actual teamwork. Want an actually friendly community? Like the sound of xenomorphic teeth ripping through space marine armor? Like feeling like like the STATE OF THE BADASS ART? GET THIS GAME.Down to its core, NS2 is a game of teamwork. Two asymetrical teams fight to the death for the future of their species. This isn't an average FPS. Both teams, the human Frontiersman and the alien Kharaa, have radical differences in playstyle, but also some striking similarities. The largest similarity, is the presesne of a player acting as a commander for the team. Being a commander compared to being a soldier or a skulk on the front lines is radically different as well. You have to act as the coordinator of your team. You are responsible for keeping an eye on the map, and telling your teammates what needs to be done. NS2 is like an armsrace, where both teams compete to outdamage, outgrow, and eventually overwhelm the other. Playing as a marine, you experience an almost completely different game than as an alien. And because each and every game populated by soley players, no two games are alike. NS2 is not a ""spunk-gargle-weewee 360 noscope FPS"". NS2 is a game of tactics.Natural Selection looks beautiful. The sci-fi maps, the Darwinism-on-steroids aesthetics of the Kharaa, the sounds, the effects... These all give NS2 this amazing and unique appearance. I have felt true fear when the aliens cut the lights and forced me to engage them in near pitch dark. I have felt the pride swell at being a part of a sucessful push into enemy territory. I have felt the joys of victory, the humility of defeat, and also respect for the enemy team when they manage to outmaneouver us.The community of Natural Selection 2 is generally friendly and helpful. While there might be a few bad examples here and there, the players are consistantly nice. So long as you're not a caustic individual, you find the community to be one of the strongest aspects of this game.Get this game. As a fan of the Alien series, this is the game I never recieved. As a fan of deeper games, NS2 has more depth than any probably any other online shooter out there. Thats why I recommend this game. Because this was the kind of game I was always looking for.			"

												This is not your average shooter. You don't sit in hallways and snipe, you don't lurk in corners or vents (unless you're an alien :D ), and you really can't lone wolf effectively. The different sides, alien and marines, require different mindsets and strategies to win. You normally can't just run as a solo skulk or marine and win. The map designs are amazing and the atmosphere is very impressive. There are specific areas of each map that one side will excel at using and trying to take one of those areas as the other side is usually costly. The maps are also unique in layout and space use. Not every map is a tiny cluster**** or a giant open arena. The game and its ""classes"" require a bit of learning. It isn't just who can shoot fastest or get kills most effectively. There is far more going on and the strategy side of commander mode can rapidly change the outcome of a battle. The hardest part was getting used to commander mode. I am a fan of the RTS style game but this was a whole new level of awesome. Players following orders you gave and seeing your upgrades or buildings change the tide is downright exciting. I do have some problems with game optimization and mechanics but its nothing to cry about. TL;DR If you enjoy teamwork, strategic gameplay, and general awesomeness this is a fine game. It is absolutely worth the buy and worth practicing. It can be tough to learn and may even not be enjoyable at first. This is until you get some practice in and learn the ropes. FInd a newbie friendly server (marked on server browser) and get started!			"

												After playing this game the first time, I literally said ""F this game."" I constantly got destroyed repeatedly, aliens were literally the hardest thing to get a kill in (outside getting a Onos) and I just didn't understand the game.After my ""Second"" tour of duty, I gave the game more than a 2 hour shot. Looking back on that 2nd shot, I'm happy I did. Once getting past the STEEP learning curve, I was able to hang with pack. No longer getting destroyed everytime I encountered anyone or anything and was able to really appreciate what this game is... RTS mixed with FPS.It's really a great an idea, you live and die with your commander or hive leader. If you don't listen to their orders, you lose. If you do... you have a fighting chance depending on his skill level. This game requires you to work together otherwise you get dominated by groups. Remember that, cause if you don't... you'll soon learn. With that aspect brought up, I've really felt a sense of accomplishment when we slowly started pushing across the map and constant yelling over the coms to get to the ""Computer Lab, we're under attack there"". Once you arrive in the computer lab, you'll know what this game is about. Cluster F*** of Aliens and Marines just trying to ""win"" that one spot for your team. If you win it, you have a sense of ""We did it"" but that sense slowly drifts away once the enemy re-directs it attention else where. You'll have choices to go help that next area or punch them where it hurts and push forward. Sometimes your commander will make the call, other times you have to know whats best for the team. With that being said, I give this game a 8/10 and a recommend buy if at a discounted price. ($25 dollars is a pretty steep cost for the amount of learning curve you have to deal with).			"

												Do you like RTS? Do you enjoy FPS? Then let me introduce you to Natural Selection 2! This sequel of hybrid FPS/RTS is a fantastic game. If you have someone to play with, it will be even more enjoyable. It's very skill based and the further you let the enemy team progress, the worse it'll get for you. The graphics are truely a ""next gen"" experience as infestation is something I've never seen so detailed in a game before. Team work is the key focus here. IF you don't work with your team, you're gonna have a bad time.  "

												I would sort of recommend this game. In your chidhood, do you remember playing a game where you would rush a position held by an enemy and die repeatedly until you found a crack in their security and burrowed your way through? this game does just that. With an interesting take on RTS and FPS games, this game would've been good during release. However now anyone who plays is a competitive player, and will ridicule you for being bad, and dying way too much.			"

												NATURAL SELECTION 2:This game is outstanding! I played the original Natural Selection MOD for Half-Life and this is a gorgeous looking game through and through. It's aesthetic cohesion and replayability make this something that can be played time and time again.   Between Marines and Aliens, and the many maps and technologies and lifeforms and upgrades and the cooperation and coordination is key. Then there is the COMMANDER role that turns this already grand game into its own RTS style interface, a birds-eye-view of the action; needing to listen to your troops/hordes requests and concerns. Communication is the cornerstone of this game, so having a good headset is a must. This game is only a few years old, but has a very strong very (generally) helpful community of players. However any game community that is independently created, crowdfunded, and operated always needs more new players to keep it alive, so thats where I URGE YOU to BUY THIS GAME! Don't be swayed by those that say it has a ""massive"" learning curve, don't get me wrong there is a learning curve, but in the best way possible. There are so many things to get good at, and strategies that can be done on the various beautifully made maps, there are so many weapons, and classes that you can be ""good"" or ""bad"" at. So it'll probably take a lot of dying before you learn how to land those ""bites"" or ""bullets"" correctly in order to secure those kills and better help protect your team and push for further command points. The strategic and coordination element of this game is out of this world, so many ways each match could be played. There are skill levels that get calculated based upon a variety of factors, namely kill/death , win/lose, attack/defend, build/destroy, time spent/rounds etc ratios. It blew me away how many variables there are in a given game, that its not just a BAD commander or a BAD player, or even just a BAD team; literally a dozen other things that could have affected a game to go one way or the other. So in the middle of a game if your losing and the team all blames the commander for not doing this or that, or the commander is blaming the team for not listening to commands or being ''noobs'' or whatever, so in short don't be scared by any learnign curve, or anything that anyone else says isn't good about this game, because they are wrong. It is filled with solid individuals from all over the world who unite together and fight in this beautiful space epic. Natural Selection 2.This game is awesome, and YOU should BUY IT!			"

												This game is the true definition of ""hidden gem"". I dare say that NS2 just may be one of the best FPS/RTS I have ever played. And trust me, I played a lot of them.Imagine playing a really awesome skill- and team-based FPS like Team Fortress 2, while at the same time 1 player in your team plays as a ""commander"", basically transforming his game into Starcraft, but instead of controlling marines and zerlings, he gives orders to players. And through teamwork, tactics and cooperation, your team must destroy the opponents base. This is what this game is all about. I have no idea if people still play NS2 (I used to play it long ago), but if they do, then definitely buy this game. It's an awesome and unique experience you will never forget.			"

												Now that I have a rig that can properly handle NS2, I think it's finally time for a review.This game is incredible. I've been playing since NS1 but the devs completely outdid themselves with 2.NS2 is extremely immersive and incredibly exciting. Strategy and teamwork are required and winning is very rewarding as a result. The graphics are rich, even on low settings and that only adds to how easily one can get zoned right in while playing. For an FPS that features two completely unique teams, the game is incredibly balanced. The devs did a bafflingly amazing job at that.Yes the game has a learning curve but the way it works makes perfect sense. It's not easy at first. As for how the community responds to inexperienced players, I'm terrible but I personally have not witnessed or experience any abuse beyond somone saying, for example, ""What the heck are you doing? Don't do that, this is where you're supposed to go or what you're supposed to do. Use this."" That's standard for any game that involves constant strategy.The game currently has a small community but almost all of the servers with players in them are either full or nearly full, so you'll always find a good game.If you have not played Natural Selection and are even just slightly considering this game, get it. If you enjoy FPS and/or strategy, get it. If you enjoy defending humanity against aliens or ripping humans apart with claws and jaws, get it. If you enjoy mech suits and jetpacks, get it. If you enjoy flying about and gassing humans, get it. If you are a gamer who takes pride in playing a wide variety of games, this is essential.If you already have this game and  are not playing it, you probably forgot how amazing it is, so play it. And why are you here reading this in the first place?			"

The major crux in this game is making NS2 Combat as a Standalone buy seperately, just for a different game mode that was VERY popular in the NS1 days.As such, thanks to this decision, NS Combat is like 8 or 9 bucks for a completely dead mode. Which sucks since Combat was a lot of high intensity fun! Even if Combat wasnt the main draw of NS, it kept a lot of players interested in the game to extend the lifespan of NS1 much longer than it should have as a mod.The lack of respect shown from Unknown Worlds has shown to this great game is staggering. Opening up a skin store and making a exclusive marine weapon to buyers is another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ move to reward your longtime players.That aside, this is a very fun team based game. I just wish that this could be absurdly popular as the NS1 days were. All love to making a great game better, but with no microtransactions.			"

												Great concept that can provide brief moments of joy when you successfully execute a clever maneuver especially if you have a good commander, which is a single player that controls the overview map and places base structures and markers to coordinate your team.Unfortunately the weapons all have the same weightless peashooter feeling (whether your chomping with teeth, shooting an assault rifle or going full tilt with a chaingun it all just feels ""meh"") and the maps are big but can be fairly confusing because each area looks mostly the same. There is also a learning curve that isn't quite worth the effort to me for those occasional spurts of brilliant fun. However, If you have a dedicated group of a half dozen online friends and you're looking for a unique multiplayer experience this could be very rewarding.			"

												This is not your average shooter. You don't sit in hallways and snipe, you don't lurk in corners or vents (unless you're an alien :D ), and you really can't lone wolf effectively. The different sides, alien and marines, require different mindsets and strategies to win. You normally can't just run as a solo skulk or marine and win. The map designs are amazing and the atmosphere is very impressive. There are specific areas of each map that one side will excel at using and trying to take one of those areas as the other side is usually costly. The maps are also unique in layout and space use. Not every map is a tiny cluster**** or a giant open arena. The game and its ""classes"" require a bit of learning. It isn't just who can shoot fastest or get kills most effectively. There is far more going on and the strategy side of commander mode can rapidly change the outcome of a battle. The hardest part was getting used to commander mode. I am a fan of the RTS style game but this was a whole new level of awesome. Players following orders you gave and seeing your upgrades or buildings change the tide is downright exciting. I do have some problems with game optimization and mechanics but its nothing to cry about. TL;DR If you enjoy teamwork, strategic gameplay, and general awesomeness this is a fine game. It is absolutely worth the buy and worth practicing. It can be tough to learn and may even not be enjoyable at first. This is until you get some practice in and learn the ropes. FInd a newbie friendly server (marked on server browser) and get started!			"

												Do you like RTS? Do you enjoy FPS? Then let me introduce you to Natural Selection 2! This sequel of hybrid FPS/RTS is a fantastic game. If you have someone to play with, it will be even more enjoyable. It's very skill based and the further you let the enemy team progress, the worse it'll get for you. The graphics are truely a ""next gen"" experience as infestation is something I've never seen so detailed in a game before. Team work is the key focus here. IF you don't work with your team, you're gonna have a bad time.  "

												After playing this game the first time, I literally said ""F this game."" I constantly got destroyed repeatedly, aliens were literally the hardest thing to get a kill in (outside getting a Onos) and I just didn't understand the game.After my ""Second"" tour of duty, I gave the game more than a 2 hour shot. Looking back on that 2nd shot, I'm happy I did. Once getting past the STEEP learning curve, I was able to hang with pack. No longer getting destroyed everytime I encountered anyone or anything and was able to really appreciate what this game is... RTS mixed with FPS.It's really a great an idea, you live and die with your commander or hive leader. If you don't listen to their orders, you lose. If you do... you have a fighting chance depending on his skill level. This game requires you to work together otherwise you get dominated by groups. Remember that, cause if you don't... you'll soon learn. With that aspect brought up, I've really felt a sense of accomplishment when we slowly started pushing across the map and constant yelling over the coms to get to the ""Computer Lab, we're under attack there"". Once you arrive in the computer lab, you'll know what this game is about. Cluster F*** of Aliens and Marines just trying to ""win"" that one spot for your team. If you win it, you have a sense of ""We did it"" but that sense slowly drifts away once the enemy re-directs it attention else where. You'll have choices to go help that next area or punch them where it hurts and push forward. Sometimes your commander will make the call, other times you have to know whats best for the team. With that being said, I give this game a 8/10 and a recommend buy if at a discounted price. ($25 dollars is a pretty steep cost for the amount of learning curve you have to deal with).			"

												NATURAL SELECTION 2:This game is outstanding! I played the original Natural Selection MOD for Half-Life and this is a gorgeous looking game through and through. It's aesthetic cohesion and replayability make this something that can be played time and time again.   Between Marines and Aliens, and the many maps and technologies and lifeforms and upgrades and the cooperation and coordination is key. Then there is the COMMANDER role that turns this already grand game into its own RTS style interface, a birds-eye-view of the action; needing to listen to your troops/hordes requests and concerns. Communication is the cornerstone of this game, so having a good headset is a must. This game is only a few years old, but has a very strong very (generally) helpful community of players. However any game community that is independently created, crowdfunded, and operated always needs more new players to keep it alive, so thats where I URGE YOU to BUY THIS GAME! Don't be swayed by those that say it has a ""massive"" learning curve, don't get me wrong there is a learning curve, but in the best way possible. There are so many things to get good at, and strategies that can be done on the various beautifully made maps, there are so many weapons, and classes that you can be ""good"" or ""bad"" at. So it'll probably take a lot of dying before you learn how to land those ""bites"" or ""bullets"" correctly in order to secure those kills and better help protect your team and push for further command points. The strategic and coordination element of this game is out of this world, so many ways each match could be played. There are skill levels that get calculated based upon a variety of factors, namely kill/death , win/lose, attack/defend, build/destroy, time spent/rounds etc ratios. It blew me away how many variables there are in a given game, that its not just a BAD commander or a BAD player, or even just a BAD team; literally a dozen other things that could have affected a game to go one way or the other. So in the middle of a game if your losing and the team all blames the commander for not doing this or that, or the commander is blaming the team for not listening to commands or being ''noobs'' or whatever, so in short don't be scared by any learnign curve, or anything that anyone else says isn't good about this game, because they are wrong. It is filled with solid individuals from all over the world who unite together and fight in this beautiful space epic. Natural Selection 2.This game is awesome, and YOU should BUY IT!			"

												I would sort of recommend this game. In your chidhood, do you remember playing a game where you would rush a position held by an enemy and die repeatedly until you found a crack in their security and burrowed your way through? this game does just that. With an interesting take on RTS and FPS games, this game would've been good during release. However now anyone who plays is a competitive player, and will ridicule you for being bad, and dying way too much.			"

This is not an easy game to get into right away, but it's a blast to play from the start and it's a blast to play when you've pumped many hours into it. The community is fun and active and will be for years ahead. Most people are helpful and kind, lending help to new players.This is a game for anyone to get into in my opinion. Mics help, but aren't required, but you DO need to listen to your teammates/com  to work together. Once you get into the flow of things, it can become a bit too addicting.Blasting aliens hecticly and chomping humans to death is delivered with beautiful level design, stunning attention to detail, andactive dev patches, new weapons, etc. Buy it n try it.

												Now that I have a rig that can properly handle NS2, I think it's finally time for a review.This game is incredible. I've been playing since NS1 but the devs completely outdid themselves with 2.NS2 is extremely immersive and incredibly exciting. Strategy and teamwork are required and winning is very rewarding as a result. The graphics are rich, even on low settings and that only adds to how easily one can get zoned right in while playing. For an FPS that features two completely unique teams, the game is incredibly balanced. The devs did a bafflingly amazing job at that.Yes the game has a learning curve but the way it works makes perfect sense. It's not easy at first. As for how the community responds to inexperienced players, I'm terrible but I personally have not witnessed or experience any abuse beyond somone saying, for example, ""What the heck are you doing? Don't do that, this is where you're supposed to go or what you're supposed to do. Use this."" That's standard for any game that involves constant strategy.The game currently has a small community but almost all of the servers with players in them are either full or nearly full, so you'll always find a good game.If you have not played Natural Selection and are even just slightly considering this game, get it. If you enjoy FPS and/or strategy, get it. If you enjoy defending humanity against aliens or ripping humans apart with claws and jaws, get it. If you enjoy mech suits and jetpacks, get it. If you enjoy flying about and gassing humans, get it. If you are a gamer who takes pride in playing a wide variety of games, this is essential.If you already have this game and  are not playing it, you probably forgot how amazing it is, so play it. And why are you here reading this in the first place?			"

												Have been playing since NS1, and NS2 is just as good, even better. But the game is dying out, completely. Around a year ago the game had many servers that had people playing, now the servers are empty. You are forced to play on servers that have a very high ping, to even be able to get a game started. I hope a NS3 will come, but I don't think it will ever. For 2 years ago I would recommend this game, but not now.			"

												I don't care for the game. Every server I've ever been to are filled with idle players in the team selection area. The commanders in the RTS part of the game don't ever seem capable of their role. The players per team balancing is all messed up, you often fight against a much larger team.The Marines team's weapons feel extremely weak, and there aren't many of them. You usually end up emptying multiple magazines into a single enemy only to die during a reload. Feels like it needs serious rebalancing. Respawn is pretty fast because what seems to be an advanced 3D printer spits out marines non stop. I can't find any reason at all to upgrade anything, as most items are equally useless. The aliens usually enjoy spawn camping rather than destroying your base (which they are always in). I've never actually made it inside the aliens' base as a marine before.The Aliens team usually consists of playing as the weakest alien for about 20 minutes, running straight into groups of marines and jumping up and down while trying to bite them. Hit detection for the aliens seems really terrible, can never seem to hit anything. Then, once you've finally gotten enough points you can evolve into a new type of alien. The catch is, if you die, you respawn as the weakest alien, lose all your points you invested into the alien you died as, and have find a way to get enough points before you can evolve into something again. I think the commanders can increase the points you generate over time somehow, though like I said most commanders aren't capable of assisting the team. Players that pick the support alien type usually don't support, instead they prefer to slide on their bellies like penguins and fly into the middle of battles. Certain players that are actually good usually pick Fade within 5 minutes somehow and never die.The sounds were decent, the gameplay was a good idea, just didn't work too well, the community wasn't impressive- no one ever seems to work together, and when they do they get killed by a lone person on the other team anyway. Balancing didn't feel right. The load times are insane, you have to wait for about 5 minutes just to join a server, something about shading and caches and what not. Shading wasn't good, there are objects in the world that completely lack shadows. Graphics were okay, nothing special, but the poor performance would suggest otherwise. The bot AI is stupid, though it is a multiplayer game, and it probably wasn't intended to be a big point in the game.Overall I can't suggest the game. Maybe a 4/10, there are worse games, but there are certainly better.			"

												Finally dropped in to play this well after release, and was disappointed to see that the Quick Match feature did not work and that loading the game assets when a match was manually found took 10 minutes - long enough for the server to have depopulated by the time I got in.  I have fond memories of the first Natural Selection, but my time is too valuable for this.			"

												Great concept that can provide brief moments of joy when you successfully execute a clever maneuver especially if you have a good commander, which is a single player that controls the overview map and places base structures and markers to coordinate your team.Unfortunately the weapons all have the same weightless peashooter feeling (whether your chomping with teeth, shooting an assault rifle or going full tilt with a chaingun it all just feels ""meh"") and the maps are big but can be fairly confusing because each area looks mostly the same. There is also a learning curve that isn't quite worth the effort to me for those occasional spurts of brilliant fun. However, If you have a dedicated group of a half dozen online friends and you're looking for a unique multiplayer experience this could be very rewarding.			"

												Unplayable for me. FPS tops out at 30. This would not be a problem were it not for the horrible input lag which is a showstopper for such a fast-paced game.This subgenre of FPS has been around for more than a decade and I'm frustrated that I can't play its most shining example with a low-to-mid-end PC. (I've spent hours on a title that came out just a year before, and that with nigh-full graphics. Which I was prepared to sacrifice. The point here is responsiveness; the lack of mouse lag.)The fact that it's been out for 2 years shows that this is either a problem at the engine level and thus very hard to solve, or that it's not a priority. Bad marks in any case.With no demo, I recommend you try it with someone else's account before paying the 25$. Luckily, my copy came in a bundle.			"

												Like the idea greatly but due to certain factors I can't recomend the game.The overall arcing idea behind the game is great. But it falls short for me on a few places.The need for a good team and commander is often a common one. With many games ending as soon as they begin with the shout of GG, This creates what I call a perfect storm game where you often waiting  for all the right players and elements to fall into place to just have some fun.Another factor which might just be me personally but I do not find the combat enjoyable at all. Aliens and Marines feel like they have no weight to them. Which fights look more like bunny hopping matches with bullets and teeth flying around the place with players hoping to land the hit.			"

Strategic elements, various classes and abilities, combined with traditional twitch skills, makes for a superb game that's hard to put down.  The competitive community is a serious one.  You're bound to develop many friendships with mature players, which makes this game even more worthwhile.  Highly Recommended!			"

												This game manages to blend the shooter and the strategy genres into one fun game. It is extremely satisfying when your team starts to pull together and outmatch the enemy team in upgrades, map control, or just plain coordination. This game is not for people who like to be lone wolves. If you do not work with your team, you will die. That is a simple truth of the game and one of the main reasons why I like the game so much.However, there is not always an active server to join. Sometimes I have had trouble finding a server that had an open slot or a good amount of people in it. When I do find a server though, the experience is incredibly fun and I am glad that I bought the game. (It is not too hard to find an active server most of the time)Overall, if you like strategic shooters or want to feel like a real colonial marine, get the game.P.S. It is a hell of a lot better than Aliens: Colonial Marines and it does what that game should have done!			"

												I do love this game. It has a good interesting idea. The aliens all play and feel different, Marine's guns and exos are fun as hell. The problems with this game are not in the game itself, but with the fanbase. This game suffers from tryhard like players. Often times you wont even notice a problem, but because the enemy is holding that one little point, or you lost one of your 3 bases, they are ready to just give up. Not all servers are like this, but they rarely name or say at any point if that server is gonna be tryhardish. I would give this game a 8-9/10. The fanbase I would give it a 5/10. It brings the whole game down when players are more willing to give up and start over rather than coming up with plans to win. Often times games go back and forth when people dont give up instantly something goes wrong. The commander may have a overview of the situation but they almost never put faith in their teamates to push back.  I am recommending this game to players who like FPSes with fun twists or people who liked AVP2. but you should really be careful about the servers you play on.			"

The game cannot attract new players well because rookies are scared away from the non-traditional style of play. The extreme necessity for working as a team, and the non-traditional combat seems to scare away potential players. The learning curve is so high, yet shadows a wonderful and unique game that has the guts to break all the rules of FPS, and does so in a beutiful and fun way.			"
