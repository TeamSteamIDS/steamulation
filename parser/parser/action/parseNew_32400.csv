												DISCLAMER: At the time of writing this review, I have 2 hours on the game. In reality I have much more, but I played it in offline mode because of traveling.At first, I was gonna make this a stupid ""Hurrr durrr this Star Wars and Doom 420/69"" type of review. However, I really do believe a great game like this deserves an actual Pro/Con review. That being said, be prepared for lots of Pros. Pros+ The environments of this game are some of the best I've ever seen in an FPS. They are all unique and encourage exploration, which makes every level memorable.+ Lots of different enemies, all faithful to the Star Wars lore. You've got your Stormtroopers, Commanders, Probe Droids, Dark Troopers and many more.+ Lots of memorable characters from the Star Wars universe. Mon Mothma, Boba Fett, and even Jabba the Hutt are all there.+ The guns are also all faithful to the Star Wars lore (You might even find a few in other SW games), and are really fun to use as well. Thermal Detonators, Repeaters, Fusion Cutters, and even the Imperial blaster rifle are all super cool and fun.+ Puzzles are thought out well, and are at that just right difficulty that you wont find too hard or easy.+ SECRETS.+ Every mission has its own briefing, which tells you exactly what you need to know, no bullcrap.+ Story takes place just before and after the Episode IV, so a big plus for me and many others. And its also super cool because YOU ARE THE ONE WHO GETS THE DEATH STAR PLANS.+ This is an FPS done well. Its so fun to blast the hell out of everyone. The gunplay is VERY fun.+ Creative obstacles. No, really. There was one room that was pitch black, with 4 Stormtroopers. The only thing that created light were all the lasers flying around, sorta like flying flashlights.+ You can use you fists to kill everyone. HOW BADASS IS THAT?Cons- The story. I mean there has to be a story, right? Except it feels so rushed and there's no point to it, because you only objective (except the level with the death star plans) is to stop the creation of Dark Troopers. Boring.- The game is super short with less than a dozen missions, and lack of replayability makes it all the shorter.- The ground feels like its ice, you keep slipping and sliding everywhere which makes it kinda hard to focus on a shot and do a bit of platforming.- Lack of a manual. Thank Lord Vader for Steam guides, because it doesn't, ever, tell you the controls in the game.- Obviously, everyone's con, the graphics. The game came out in 1995, and it has not aged well at all. If a younger gamer, or really any graphics fan picked this up, they might get turned off by the graphics. BUT THATS WHY I SAVED THE BEST FOR LAST. There is a mod for this game called DarkXL. It introduces lots of things like 1920x1080 resolution, rebindable controls, more options, being able to look up and down, a reticle, and it makes the game look fantastic. If you're picking this game up, download this mod, its worth it.[xlengine.com]This game gets a 9/10. If it had just been a bit longer, and if the story had been A BIT better, this would've been a solid 10/10.			"

Timeless and nostalgic // Recommended for those who grew up in the nineties, who 'remember the days'+ Auto-aim works consistently (though it has some issues with enemies at higher/lower elevations that must be compensated for)+ Level design is mostly excellent; encourages exploration and isn't needlessly restrictive+ Voiceovers are excellent for the year of release, particularly that of Darth Vader (I'm fairly certain it's the original voice actor from the films)+ Story is nothing spectacular, but it works well as a Star Wars game and stays fiercely loyal to the spirit of the franchise+ Great variety of weapons, some of them refreshingly original+ Audio design (weapon & enemy, etc.) is taken directly from the films+ In stark contrast to the expectedly lackluster detail in the walls and floor, the character and enemy sprites are as detailed as can be possible given the limitations of the day+ Switch and level puzzles are a great throwback to simpler mechanics from a simpler age; they are (mostly) not particularly frustrating, and most levels flow competently as a result- Uses DOS Box; cannot use Steam overlay, and minimization of the client tends to alter the Windows color scheme- Controller support is virtually nonexistant- The antagonist has no character depth or development- Despite generally excellent level design, there are exceptions that stand out as being quite frustrating to navigate and proceed through (eg.

												Star Wars: Dark Forces was one of the first video game entries to incorporate elements of the expanded universe. Built on an enhanced version of the DOOM engine, Dark Forces reset the bar for first person shooters. It introduces the lasting character of Kyle Katarn into the universe and proved that you don't have to be a Jedi or a starfighter pilot to make a successful Star Wars game. An epic storyline, combined with memorable characters and impressive level design makes this game a must have for any Star Wars fan, or those looking for a sense of nostalga about how far gaming has come. The graphics were top notch at the time of release (1995) with smooth animation and distinct sprites and textures. Digital voice work is crisp and helps to give the characters a sense of personality. From the filtered 'halt!' of stormtroopers to the anamalistic groan of the Diagnosa as you wade through raw sewage, you will always know exactly what is hunting you.Gameplay is standard fare for shooters of the time. you have a wide variety of weapons - pistols, blaster rifles, thermal detonators, along with more exotic weapons such as the fusion cutter or the assault plasma cannon. Health is non-regenerating and must be restored from medkits, along with shields. Sound direction is excellent. The music features remixes of well known Star Wars tunes along with new music. Each tune fits the level it is attached to. Weapon sounds are unique, giving every gun its own feel. Overall, this is a geat game for retro lovers. Solid gameplay, a memorable story that has influenced many other games in the franchise, and characters with actual personality makes this a good choice. On the technical side, this game comes bundled with its own auto-loading version of DOSBox, meaning that it will work on modern systems. Confirmed functional on all systems up to Windows 7 64-bit, with reports of it working properly on Windows 8 systems. 9/10. "

												The year is 1995. You're an eleven year old Star Wars nerd and your dad just bought a sweet new DOS' with, like, a whole MEGABYTE of RAM! What do you do? You get Dark Forces.In retrospect, you may think its just a DOOM-clone. But it isn't. And when it was first released, the Jedi engine was hardly thought of as anything but a massive leap gaming. With Dark Forces, you can look up and down, crouch, and even swim! There's multiple floor levels - and many of those levels feature atmospheric effects and all of them have animated textures!We're spoiled in this day and age. I recommend Dark Forces because not only is it actually fun to play, and the storyline is pretty engrossing, but its a blast from the past from when games were actually more than layers upon layers of quicktime events.

												Exceptionally well made for its time. I'd take this game over DOOM any day. Obviously, though, its age makes it good for nostalgia and not much else.The main premise is a bit off beat for Star Wars, but the universe is generally represented in a wonderfully dark, gritty and accurate perspective of a rebel-aligned bounty hunter.As an extra note, I'd like to say there is nothing cheap or fake about this game, other than the limitations that were common for its time. From start to finish, each mission feels like a well-organized challenge situated in a real, factual location of the Star Wars universe - without feeling like a repeat of any of the three original movies.

												STORY: 10/10The story is very well written for its time and draws you into the game unlike a lot of its contemporary games. It offers for a ton of memorable moments from the game.GAMEPLAY: 8/10The lack of a quicksave function really is the main downgrade for me in this game. Otherwise the game is pretty solid.GRAPHICS: 8/10No support for high res modes means you are pretty much forced to play in a low-res 320x240 mode. Otherwise the atmosphere is spot on and the levels are very well designed.The spritework feels very authentic and detailed.SOUND: 10/10Excellent music and authentic sound design. No real complaints here.FINAL SCORE: 9/10All in all, Star Wars: Dark Forces is a true classic FPS that you should definitely play if you're a fan of Star Wars or just oldschool shooters in general. Some of its features are well ahead of its time, while in some other ways it does feel a bit obsolete. But as a whole I had a blast playing this game. The force is strong with this one...Now... on to tackle the sequel, Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II!			"

												It's like Star Wars and DOOM had a baby, and the results were glorious.Great graphics for the time with art direction and sound design that still hold up today. Challenging gameplay with lengthy levels. The only real downside is that said levels can become confusing quite easily if you've never completed them.			"

Much better, more fun, and far greater than any newer games. If you can put aside graphics and the age of the game, it's really great. 14 difficult levels, very much so worth it's price. I play a lot of star wars games, and I have to say the Jedi Knights and dark forces games are da bomb. Get this game.			"

												You see, I always knew Kyle Katarn would be a jedi someday.  You know why?  It's pretty damn obvious... when he's around, stormtroopers can't aim worth♥♥♥♥♥♥=====Dark Forces... what is this?  It's an FPS from the DOS and PS1.  Don't back off the store page just yet, bear with me.  Is it canon? ... Yes it is, George Lucas just hit his head hard, and now somehow thinks the Death Star plans were taken by a bunch of plain old rebels and some blind dude.  Nope, it was Kyle, the one man rebel pain train.This game's very doom-style, mixing together 2D sprites with 3D terrain.  You may also notice the way the X axis is locked, just like doom.  But wait, what's this... what happens if I use PgUp/PgDown... oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm looking up and down!  And there you have it.  This is a doom-style that also allows jumping, crouching, and looking up and down.  Have your fill of ""innovation?""  Good, now let's talk about what we all really care about-- gameplay.If you haven't already guessed, it's a Star Wars shooter leading up to the events of the Star Wars: Jedi Knight franchise.  You play as mercenary Kyle Katarn and it begins with a setting we'll recognize easily-- this is an imperial base.  Go steal the plans to the Death Star.  Then, the story takes a unique Extended Universe approach, as we follow the development of an Imperial super-soldier project, codenamed ""Dark Troopers.""  Your missions are to go into various places and carry out the assignment given to you, as you go deeper into the project and try to put a stop to it.The level design is great... it has a good balance of puzzles, firefights, raids, speedruns, and more as you plow through stormtroopers and Imperial officers, as well as the occasional robot.  More than that, the levels themselves are very dynamic and overall, the use of elevators and moving platforms really add to the game.  Multiple weapons can be found, from Blaster Rifles to Thermal Detonators to Imperial Heavy Repeaters, and the sprites/texturing are still at least decent.  The game itself is completely solid, and visually it won't hurt to look at with the simple Imperial designs.The only pitfall in this game is its technical updates, or lack thereof.  Now, I'm not the stubborn asshat I used to be, and I get it-- these old games generally don't have their source code laying around, not everything is preserved as it should be.  This semi-but-not-really excuses some aspects, like the continued lack of vertical aim.  However, what can't be overlooked are the basic flaws that take all of ten minutes to fix.  Why is DOSBox outdated?  The rerelease comes with the ancient 0.73 version of DOSBox, while the final version (0.74) is a massive step up fixing many color issues and framerate problems, particularly in this game and other late 2.5D titles.  If you have any issues, check the bottom of this review for guides on how to update DOSBox, make it run better, and (optional) add controller support.Overall: Rerelease, 7/10.  Game itself: 8.5/10, frantic Star Wars Extended Universe action with great level design and genuinely challenging puzzles.  It's definitely an odd one though, so if you're looking for some mindless mayhem by the likes of Doom or CoD, this is not the game you're looking for.============CompatibiltyThe following Steam guides will help you make the game work smoothly on your PC without color issues.Update DOSBox to 0.74:

Devo's dropping the mike...AGAIN!Disclaimer: I am a huge Star Wars fan, and have played this game a lot as a child/teenager, so as my foot note points out (see the bottom of my review pages), this review may be biased.Title Information  Review Title Star Wars: Dark Forces   Review Date 13th of February 2016   PC Release Date 15th of February 1995   Developer LucasArts   Publisher LucasArts, LucasFilm, Disney Interactive   Genre 1st Person Shooter   Series Dark Forces (1st in the series)   Single Player Yes   Multiplayer No  Ratings  Category Score   Story 8/10   Single Player Gameplay 7/10   Multiplayer Gameplay NA   Graphics & Art Style 8/10   Replayability 7/10   Overal Rating 8/10 (See bottom of the page for ranking descriptions)Devo's Seal of Approval?:Absolutely. Fans of retro 1st person shooters shouldn't miss this nostalgic inducing, challenging, pixel art title. Considering this game was made over 20 years ago, it's held up remarkably well, and in my opinion is better than Doom.PROS Captures the essence of Star Wars in a way that even George Lucas (""The Maker"") couldn't capture with the prequel trilogy, Beautiful level design inspired by classic movie locales, A wide range of interesting weapons, Classic Star Wars characters, including a brief appearance by Boba Fett!!! Lots of Stormtroopers, Imperial Officers, Mouse Droids & Gamorean Guards, If you played this as a child, get ready for nostalgia overload, Classic Star Wars to the core,CONS No Y-axis mouse control, Becomes quite cheap towards the end of the game, particularly on the last level, Some unintuitive puzzles, I personally couldn't get Steam Overlay to work,UPDATE please see @Kill-Cam Celebrity's comments dated 9th of March 2016 for a detailed workaround regarding the steam overlay issues. The review remains unchanged because this is only a work-around, and not a straight-forward one at that. Big thanks to @Kill-Cam Celebrity for providing this.CONCLUSIONS...""Look how old you've become"". BUT WHO CARES! YOU'RE STILL AWESOME! What a great visit to my childhood. This classic Star Wars experience, heavily inspired by the original trilogy, is a morsel of gaming history. In thier glory days, LucasArts really did excel at game development, and they hit all the right beats with this title too...on so many levels.Revisiting this game after 20 years really highlights how much of the original trilogy LucasArts packed into this experience. From the classic enemies and weapons, to the incredible level design and vistas. It was great fighting Stormtroopers on a level whose interior was inspired by the Corellian Corvette from Episode IV, and undertaking a platform puzzle while jumping between pillars which look remarkably like the Death Star tractor beam controls. This game brought back so many memories from my early days of PC gaming, and I thuroughly loved it. I can't wait to ""hook into"" the rest of this series, and i'll definately be plaing Dark Forces again in the future._______________________RANKING DESCRIPTIONS  Score Description   1 This pile of c%$p made me want to take a break from gaming!   2 Avoid this title like a fat man on a diet avoids cake.   3 Why did they even bother? Oh wait...they didn't, so niether should you.   4 I wouldn't play this unless I was really, really desperate, or the biggest fan alive.   5 While there are some interesting aspects of this title, there are just too many faults to recommend it to anyone.   6 An ""average"" title which has some redeeming qualities, however, be warned that it also has its fair share of flaws...   7 A good game and it probably shouldn't be missed by fans of the series or genre, but be warned there are better games out there which are more deserving of your time and money.   8 An excellent title which shouldn't be missed if you can help it. I found it hard to put this game down, and I hope you do too.   9 A master piece! As close to perfect as any title can get. You are truly missing out on an unbelievable gaming experience if you do not play this game.   10 PERFECT. Nothing more needs to be said All ratings and opinions expressed in this review are subjective, and therefore are effected in part by my own preferences & predisposiitons. I have not received any gifts or gratuities froma any party for this work. "

												Many call this game just a Doom clone, but of course it's not as simple as that. Like most games from the early days of the (partial) 3D first-person shooter genre, Dark Forces builds on what was established by its predecessors. It takes Doom's formula, uses it as the foundations and creates something new and improved (just like Doom did with Wolfenstein 3D). From a gameplay perspective it is quite similar, but a number of key features have been added which were quite new in 1995.In addition to all the typical stuff you'd expect from a mid-1990s shooter, Dark Forces also allows the player to aim vertically (this can however only be done using the numpad; the mouse is used for horizontal aiming instead). Other features added by the Jedi engine are the ability to jump and crouch and a number of atmospheric effects. Some missions require the use of a headlamp, night vision, gas mask, special boots and other tools. The player can also throw thermal detonators (explosives).Dark Forces is set in the Star Wars universe. Since it is a licensed production, everything from the visuals and sound effects have a distinct feel. If you enjoyed the original trilogy of Star Wars (episodes IV, V and VI), this game will certainly make you feel nostalgic. The levels are slightly less abstract than Doom, but they are still very well designed and quite complicated, also forcing the player to think by adding various puzzles throughout. Dark Forces has a total of 14 missions and during the course of the game you will see aesthetically different environments.Besides differences in gameplay and visuals, Dark Forces is also more story-focused than the Doom games. You play as Kyle Katarn, a mercenary recruited by the Rebel Alliance, one that used to work for the Galactic Empire. The plot begins shortly before the events of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, but gradually takes you past the ending of the film and takes place between A New Hope and Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back. It's not masterful storytelling, but the simple plot and visually pleasant cutscenes make the game more engaging.Overall, the game's numerous mechanical improvements and technological advancements make it a natural successor to Doom 2, adding variety to the Doom gameplay formula. Star Wars: Dark Forces was a brilliant game for its time; since then it has influenced other amazing titles (such as Duke Nukem 3D) and remains a classic.NOTE: The Steam re-release of this game isn't entirely up to scratch. Upon launching the game, you will experience terrible performance issues (especially when there are multiple enemies on screen). It's nothing that a quick Google search can't fix, but it should be in-game from the get-go.			"

												This game manages to remind you why you got into gaming in the first place. The main reason for still being a lot of fun is the great level design, never too large or too small or overly complicated. The environment of the levels, the weapons and the enemies are quite varied too.If you were there when it came out you should re-play it, after a level or two you'll tell why this game is still great and why most of todays single player fpses aren't.

												Yes, this game does look like crap on modern 1920x1080 monitors; and no, you do not get a lightsaber and force powers.Despite the limitations of it being a product of its time this game excelled at visual style and level design; whether you were infiltrating an Imperial Base, in Nar Shadda, or running through a star ship you truely felt you were in A Galaxy Far Far Away.Younger gamers that place an importance on up-to-date graphics and gameplay should pass on this; but this game is a must-have for anyone who has any interest in classic FPS gaming.

												I played this game as a kid and In my opinion it definitely still holds up. There are some interesting levels and weapons. The whole thing is drenched in Star Wars without following the movie storylines. The music is excellent as well.  It should only take a few hours to blast through all the levels on normal and if you haven't played this yet, and enjoy Star Wars stuff or shooters in general, you owe it to yourself to play through this game.

												Havent played it yet? If not, then go and play it! Of course everybody hates such graphics, but still, this game was made with heart. It is as simple as Doom and interesting as any Star Wars movie. Reasons why should you at least try to play it: Perfect plot for a Star Wars game  Perfect voicecast Perfect soundtrackThis game deserves a gold medal!			"

Star wars: Dark Forces				* 8/10After 20 years I can finally play Dark Forces. When I was a kid I've always been puzzled whether or not I should have played it but, you know, money wasn't mine and my father was very reluctant on spending too much money, we already had DooM and DooM 2, so... But now, with steam sales... MUAHUAHUAHAUHAU...Star Wars Dark Forces was the first chapter of what later would become the Jedi Knight Saga. It's obviously set in the Star wars universe, around the first trilogy, between Episode IV (Kyle brings the death star plans to Mon Mothma) and VI (Kyle frees Crix Madine who explains the attack plan at the Moon of Endor). Our protagonist Kyle Katarn is a Mercenary hired by Mon Mothma and the Rebellion for various operations against th empire. During a mission Kyle and his partner Jan Ors will meet an odd advanced and deadly robotic trooper, and they will investigate this creation to find out a plan for mass production of these deadly ""Dark Troopers"".So the game is essentially an FPS, one of the first as this came out after DooM, so the engine and the aspect is quite similar, hence there will be solid ambiences and 2d characters and items. But even though the engine looks pixellous as much as doom there are some very ""solid"" ad interesting news. There are Moving level parts, and I'm not talking about the classic elevators, but solid bridges or other parts that will slide or rotate according to their purpose. Besides there will be solid objects, or ""entities"" that will move, such as mechanic assembly arms, Tie Fighters, and that little black imperial Mini4wd that will run around rooms...Besides the engine, the weaponry is quite impressive apart from the trooper's iconic blaster (imprecise by default, almost kind of justifying the HORRIBLE Stormtroopers' aim... XD), the Thermal detonator (used by Leia to threaten Jabba The Hutt, but despite the name, here's just a grenade exploding on impact) you can count on a very big arsenal, but the most interesting part are items: especially night vision goggles and the light are the most impressive to me, especially the latter influencing the lighting of the rooms.Unfortunately (or luckily) this game is released as the original one running on DosBox. I was almost afraid to face another useless HORRIBLE release as seen with the original DooMs, BUT!!! It runs perfectly, with a good (X-axis only) mouselook integration and WASD movement setting. Unfortunately I wasn't able to find any key binding setup both ingame or in DosBox config (I know, there shouldn't be any, but you know, just in case) so I had to rely on some trial and error. I could have avoided that since there's a steam F.A.Q. with all the keys list and explains how to remap through a DosBox specific function. I also had to manually increase the cycles for the DosBox Emulator because the framerate was too lowWhat really surprised me is the level design. Apart from the Star Wars aspect, the game gets to the point of pushing you to the limit by forcing you to get to hidden points, shoot to remotely triggered buttons, Make tough jumps and go back and forth in a maze of doors and buttons. It wasn't that nightmare today, but for the time I believe it was a very tough game, I'm sure.Music is made of classic Star Wars themes and original Star Wars oriented tracks... rendered in MIDI, obviously XD. The best part of this is something that was very original at the time: dynamic music. A Slow pace track during exploration and faster more intense tracks smoothly kick during more active and shooting situations. This gives a great effect, because of both the Star Wars nostalgia themes and for the kind of music that perfectly suits the situation.+++PROs+++ STAR WARS. Enemies, weapons, ambience and music, not to mention the cinematics. Elements that simply kicks you back in the Star wars universe, not to mention all the various references. TOUGH. The latest levels are quite a maze and count a lot on hidden passages, or buttons, or small but complicate riddles to let you proceed with the level. INNOVATIONS. Even though the game is based on Star Wars universe, the engine is a classic FPS in DooM style, it still shows some innovations with solid platforms moving, sliding and rotating or even few 3d models animated and moving in the levels.---CONs--- NO SAVE. Unfortunately missions are quite long and you can't save your progress while you're at it, so you'll have to face every mission entirely from start to end without any chance to save. You also have a set of lives, for which I still don't see the point. At least at the end of each mission the progress is saved... CPU CYCLES. DosBox CPU Cycle was quite low on my machine (20.000) causing to play with low framerate. I had to increase it manually (30.000). STORMTROOPERS' AIM. At the easiest difficulty stormtroopers' aim is really faithful to the movies, as they randomly shoot towards you, without hitting you once... XD "

												The mods are coming, the mods are coming!  Mouse look, give me mouse look!It's amazing how good mouse look was for gaming, kind of like the anolog stick for the play station... That is game breaking for me.. I love this game, great story, very fun even though it's quite old and graphics are basically doom2 standard... but oh the mouse look.A great fun adventure of the great Kyle Katarn, a good start to a great series.  The only thing is that the enemy AI is very simple and it relies on mass numbers, but hey it's old school.  If you've never played early 90's shooters, this will not be easy on the eyes, but running around in Vader's star destroyer destroying dark troopers is tops. "

												Never played this game before. Picked it up in a sale bundle and immediately was hooked on the platform shooter style that made Wolfenstein 3D and Doom popular. It plays well has a bunch of hidden easter eggs and the game audio is pretty crispy for a game from 1995. If you're looking to zap Imperial Empire Baddies and burn a couple of hours this game is great. I played it for 11 hours straight when I picked it up and was thoroughly impressed with the game overall.			"

I just care about gameplay. I'll just remind you that Star Wars: Dark Forces is the first game to include the ability to look up and down, crouching and jumping. It is a major FPS game that most of the people forget. You HAVE to try this game if you like DOOM or Star Wars.10/10			"

												There is no way to not recommend Dark Forces to people who don't like to be treated like idiots nowadays.It's a classic FPS almost all the way. A map, mazelike levels, a full set of weaponry, and absolutely no excuses. Even if it's arguably the worst shooter from the higher shelf of its times, it's still a load of fun and just a competent production. Unfortunately it suffers from an obvious marketing disease. It's short and levels - despite being real mazes by today's standards - are small. Secret hunting leaves a lot to desire as well. It sure ain't DN3D or even Shadow Warrior. It boils down to lack of replayability. I doubt I will come back to this title after completing it (I missed few secrets). The lack of save function is infuriating.Also Steam goes down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, lazy-releasing classic titles. They couldn't even get the dosbox right. They couldn't bother themselves to spend few minutes more.Basically, this game needs a HD makeover, like DN3D or ShW both received.			"

												Star Wars Dark Forces is a FPS set during the events of the original Star Wars movie trilogy. In a nice surprise you don't follow the events of the movies but instead work as a mercenary for the Rebels. You are a mercenary called Kyle Katarn who is fully voice acted and seems to be in it for more than the money. In your travels you will discover that the Empire is working on a secret project to make Dark Troopers and it becomes your main reason for most of the missions. Along your travels you will encounter some familiar characters. Most will only appear in cutscenes and don't show up in game so don't go in expecting to be able to gun down Darth Vader.Your journeys will take you to a wide variety of environments and nearly each one feels unique and introduce more and more enemies. Most levels are enormous and they will take you quite some time to beat. It's not just running and gunning though, there will be rather difficult puzzles and actual objectives like rescuing a hostage or stealing data and making a run for the spacecraft. It's a nice change from most FPS games of the time where your only goal is to reach the end of the level. As unique and varied as the levels are the actual level design can be very confusing at times. A considerable portion of my playtime comes from being at an utter loss of where I am supposed to head to next and it definitely impacts the game negatively.Strangely Dark Forces does not allow you to save manually and the game will only save after you complete a level. You start off with three lives and can find more throughout the level though they are usually well hidden. If you see cracks on a wall it is likely you can blow it up and find some goodies. And my biggest gripe with this game is the amount of platforming you will be required to do. The controls do not feel tight enough for platforming and with the lack of quick saving it can truly be irradiating. Luckily the gun-play is top notch and there are a wide variety of weapons to dispose of your enemies. Some do share ammo like the pistol and the blaster which adds more strategy since you will have to decide if the situation is dangerous enough to use more ammo with the blaster. You can also punch out Stormtroopers or other enemies, which is very amusing to me but should be used as a last resort.It is very true to it's source material having each gun sound exactly like in the movies, Stormtroopers shouting “Rebel scum!” and most of the music in Dark Forces are from the film but remade into MIDI format. I'm not sure if all the weapons are canon but this game does not feature lightsabers in case you were wondering. The story itself is mediocre and mostly told through cutscenes after or before missions. Most of the voice acting is surprisingly good especially Darth Vader and your character not being a generic mute protagonist is also appreciated. There is a nice sense of urgency as your enemies get more and more powerful as you progress through the story and you will definitely find out why the Rebels are so worried about the Empire's secret project. If you are having difficulty seeing remember that you have have night vision goggles which use up energy that you obtain by blowing up cleaning droids. This version of the game has modern controls right out the box. You will be moving around with “wasd” and aiming with the mouse. Strangely you will not be able to look up and down using the mouse. There is no way to see the control scheme or rebind in game which is kind of annoying. Combat is fast paced and enjoyable. Most enemies have different means of attack like either shooting you or running toward you for a melee attack and it is very easy to tell an enemy apart allowing you to adapt and respond to a situation on the fly. A certain enemy in the sewer level stalks you from the sludge and boy, did they creep me out. When you pick up a powerup that doubles your rate of fire the game usually throws a large amount of enemies at you which is always a blast as you mow down all in your path and after all is said and done you will feel like the best darn mercenary money can buy.Overall Dark Forces is a pretty fun game kept from greatness due to a few serious design decisions. The flaws of having confusing level design, no saving, and controls not suited for the sometimes fatal platforming is just too deadly a combination. It is still a good game don't get me wrong. I had a blast playing through it and seeing Stormtroopers being competent fighters for once.  It is also pretty advanced for it's time featuring voiced cutscenes, level objectives and  an actual story to back it up. It is not a must play for those of us that are not a fan of the films but it's still a decent old school shooter. Though if you like both the FPS genre and Star Wars you should definitely check out this title.			"

												Like any game this old, any recommendation is going to come with a lot of salt, and largely boils down to your personal tolerance level.Dark Forces is basically Doom with a Star Wars wallpaper, though apparently it made a few technological improvements over Doom, such as the ability to have multiple floors on top of one another. This is just heresay on my part, I'm not a videogame historian.The level design is fairly nonlinear and encourages plenty of exploration, but personally I found that the inability to look up and down (more than about 45 degrees either way, with really weird visual distortions) left me having only a vague idea that a floor was beneath my feet, which was incredibly disorienting and left me playing through most of the game with the transparent map screen plastered to my face (though I'll admit I found the way the map dynamically updated based on purely literal line of sight weirdly enthralling).Like many FPSes, or indeed games of this age in general, the bosses ammount to little more than a single enemy that is both better at killing you and worse at dying. Can't really dock points there, it's not like you can expect elaborate boss mechanics in a game that slightly predates the notion of having to actually aim your gun at things.While I still had enough fun to give this game a recommendation, do NOT try playing it without a walkthrough on hand. Many of the puzzles involve a sort of sideways moon logic that I never would have figured out on my own, even if I could fnavigate without staring at the map during firefights.			"

												9.5/10 must-play. In this classic FPS you play as a scruffy nerf-herder of a smuggler in the Star Wars universe. The ultimate roguish badass Kyle Katarn will be defying the galactic empire, dealing with bounty hunters and running into characters we all know from the movies.On a technical level, DF falls between Doom and Quake. The well laid out, dynamic, 3d maps are a joy, but great 90s graphics are still 90s graphics. Luckily the familiarity of the design and enemies will make up for that and draw you in. Not least it serves as the launching point for one of gaming's epic series.			"

												Incredible game that follows the old school Doom format. The beginning of Kyle Katarn's saga. The start of one of Star Wars better video game stories. I couldn't recommend it anymore. Just play it. If you love Star Wars you will love it. The mazes can get a bit crazy but stick with it and play the sequels. All great. I recommend the Dark XL mod. It upgrades graphics and makes the gameplay better with things like being able to look vertically. Look for the mod guide right here on Steam. You won't regret it.			"

This is just heresay on my part, I'm not a videogame historian.The level design is fairly nonlinear and encourages plenty of exploration, but personally I found that the inability to look up and down (more than about 45 degrees either way, with really weird visual distortions) left me having only a vague idea that a floor was beneath my feet, which was incredibly disorienting and left me playing through most of the game with the transparent map screen plastered to my face (though I'll admit I found the way the map dynamically updated based on purely literal line of sight weirdly enthralling).Like many FPSes, or indeed games of this age in general, the bosses ammount to little more than a single enemy that is both better at killing you and worse at dying. Can't really dock points there, it's not like you can expect elaborate boss mechanics in a game that slightly predates the notion of having to actually aim your gun at things.While I still had enough fun to give this game a recommendation, do NOT try playing it without a walkthrough on hand. Many of the puzzles involve a sort of sideways moon logic that I never would have figured out on my own, even if I could fnavigate without staring at the map during firefights.			"

												Doom with Star WarsIn Dark Forces, you play as an ex-stormtrooper turned alliance mercenary Kyle Katarn on a quest to stop the Imperial ""Dark Trooper"" project, which are robotic stormtroopers built to attack rebel strongholds. This is a classic 90s shooter where there is no regenerative health, back tracking is involved, there is no reloading and instead ammo pick-ups. You can look up and down, but only using page up and page down, left and right via mouse. The port is pretty solid for the most part and runs well. I'm enjoying the hell out of it and highly reccomend you to buy it now.			"

												Dark Forces is the second computer game I've played in my life. It was late '95 or early '96, an exciting time because Bill Clinton was in some kind of scandal. I used a keyboard only on an IBM. AOL dial-up was the standard. Anyways, long story short, I have many fond memories of this game. In fact, subjectively speaking this game is better than the entire Halo series put together. Finding it on Steam and having it run on Windows 10 was very touching. On the Slootometer I rate it 0/10 because there is no slooty content.			"

												Best money spent in a long time.  Reliving my childhood for a buck-fifty (on sale) really should be impossible.Trying to figure out how to reload = awesome.Trying to figure out how to aim down the sights = awesome.Trying to figure out how to melee = awesome.Trying to figure out how to get the camera to pitch up or down = awesome.Just don't Alt-Tab like I did assuming that I could write a quick review after loving the first five minutes.  The DOS bootstrapper application thing doesn't like when you do this.The goosebumps I got from the load screen alone was worth the price of admission.  Everything else is gravy.  But there is a lot of content in this game, as I recall.  Like probably a lot of people, I have continued to occasionally play old school Doom once every couple years, but I haven't touched this in two decades.I'm so psyched to play this.  I remember screaming like a little girl when the garbage monster thing unexpectedly hit me while I was swimming in sewage.  Can't wait.			"

												Great fun for an old-school FPS that's in betweem Doom and Duke Nukem 3D.A little mazey in some levels so you might get lost once or twice. The automap is your best friend.  Enemies could be a little more varied, but overall it's fun shooting, with half of the weapons having alt-fires to spice things up.Overall, there are some neat puzzles, and innovative level design for the time, with a lot of y-axis oriented design, including buildings which have several floors. There are also some pretty cool 3D models and sector effects, some of which reminded me a lot of what you can find DN3D's space episode.The story is well done and really sets the tone for the levels and the objectives. Only thing I disliked is when at the end of a level, the game makes you backtrack to the beginning of it for story reasons.			"

												Dark Forces is a great oldschool FPS if you know you like those sorts of games. It's really fun pew-pewing half the stormtroopers in the Empire, at least.Like most of its contemporaries, this game was groundbreaking; in DF's case it gave people in the mid-1990s the feeling of being in a Star Wars movie (that wasn't a prequel: those would come out a couple years later). Unlike most of its contemporaries, it accomplished this partly by putting actual effort into telling a story. Nothing amazing, but it's good enough to keep you playing and find out what that rascally Darth Vader is up to next.The DosBOX port is actually good as long as you edit the configuration file to double the allotted CPU cycles - it runs like a turtle uphill otherwise. There's a checkpoint system to make up for the lack of saving in the levels, which can get rather labyrinthine, so keep that in mind. The game still isn't quite as hard or long as the old DOOM could get, especially since Kyle Katarn here punches like a literal champ.As an aside, this was the only Dark Forces game I was interested in, due to its similarity to the old Doom formula (the engine is very similar to Duke Nukem 3D's Build) and because I'm not that interested in being a magical overpowered Jedi.

												Star Wars Dark Forces was one of the first Star Wars games I played and it remains to this day one of the best too. Dark Forces also deserves a lot of recognition for spawning the Jedi Knight series, one of the best game series available and one of the very few Star Wars series that's truly worth playing.Perhaps one of the greatest strengths of the game was it's technical innovations. While playing it today may seem borderline impossible because of it's age Dark Forces pioneered many concepts that have become staple in FPS games today such as multiple height levels, looking up and down and flying enemies. Vertical gameplay in general was a massive feature.Booting the game up today does show it's age, and while it was a great game for it's time playing it nowadays is not really an option.A great game and one that deserves a lot of credit and recognition but also one that's not worth the play anymore in this age of technology.

												Even though this dates back to a couple years after the release of Doom, Dark Forces still offers some good gameplay and a good Star Wars storyline.  While I recommend the game, it probably will only be enjoyed by Star Wars fans and those who originally played the game back in the 90s when it was released.  While you can control the view with the mouse, I couldn't get it to look up and down, which made it difficult at times, though not too frustrating.  The level design is good and the action is decent, and it brings back fond memories of playing this on my 486.  As usual for any Star Wars game, great music and great audio.			"

												LucasArts (rip in piece) took a step into first person action games with 1995's Dark Forces.One thing that makes this Doom clone stand out is a lot of engine work. There are various differences in geometry, such as cliffs, pits, platforms, etc, and ambient lighting is colored, as well as colored fog.Gameplay wise, you play as mercenary Kyle Katarn as he under takes missions for the Rebellion. From stealing the Death Star plans to escaping Jabba the Hutt's sail barge, the game throws you into maps, and gives you goals.Unlike Doom, you don't just find the exit. You actually have objectives to do, and if you fail those objectives, you lose the level.The voice acting is quite good for the time, the gameplay and maps are all great, and the game proved that LucasArts could craft amazing story lines with it's own universe. The Dark Forces series remains one of the best Star Wars series availible, and I would recommend this game to pretty much anyone that likes Star Wars.			"

It is a fantastic Doom era FPS, and the developers had the sense to recognize that if they couldn't implement a lightsaber properly, there's no sense in doing it at all. Instead, you get a solid variety of weapons and a huge variety of enemies from the Star Wars universe. It's a fantastic Star Wars side story, and the beginnings of a well known extended universe character.			"

												This game is amazing. I want it to be clear: while I heard about it in elementary school [Year 3 schooling] I did not play nor see the gameplay at all. I have no nostalgia whatsoever. The closest is DOOM which I only now know is similar. I actually did not find DOOM compelling but I saw DOOM for the good game it is, that is another story.My review therefore is absolutely uncolored by nostalgia of childhood or any other sort.This game is an absolute amazing shooter that stands the test of time! I started it up only because it was a fast download to play while the other downloads got done.Next thing I know I am totally and utterly entranced by the amazing enemy and weapon graphics, the levels are beautiful for the time but wall textures are slightly ""meh"". They are the worst part for me, which means the game is great, and the walls are still not that bad.The sound and cutscenes are great! I thought they'd be a laugh, in fact, I didn't think the game would play let alone be so easy for me to start up and blast my way through enemies without modding or any BS. This is truly a gem, I regret not playing it sooner, but if I have I could not write such a straight and honest review without suspect nostalgia creeping in.The story so far is unique and most characters are too. It's not out of its element either, it sticks to a ""FPS therefore FPS managable story"". What I mean, is while the grand story of Star Wars is definitely here, it holds its own. It does NOT RELY on the Star Wars story [Of course the lore is huge in it but on its own.]I honestly cannot recommend this game enough. 10/10, would not regret going back in time and begging parents to buy it for me. Absolute full score here. My only worry is how it's ruining the fact that Star Wars games have now been shown to have been so compelling in the past, at least this one, and slowly broken down.Again, 10/10. First time playing as of a little bit before writing this. Not colored by rosy nostalgia. Absolute dream in the style of DOOM, except Star Wars. Perfect.			"

												Star Wars: Dark ForcesI have heard much about this game for years but never got around to playing it.  Thankfully, the May 4th sale gave me that opportunity.  Eleven hours later into the game, it is very doom-esque (it uses the same or similar engine as doom) and has very good (90's) shooter mechanics with a Star Wars twist to it.  In this game you play as Kyle Katarn, the smuggler turned jedi, turned back into smuggler, turned back into jedi.  Kyle along with his partner Jan are out to save the day.  That's as far as I'm going to go with the story since it's too good for spoilers.For a game that was released back in the 90's, the gameplay mechanics are tight, fun and precise.  There are a good variety of weapons which is surprising for a FPS Star Wars game in today's market.  I think the most important part of the weaponry option is that every weapon has a purpose.  You have your traditional blaster pistol & blaster rifle, along with rockets, grenades, and other unique tools used for slaughtering stormies.  The level design for the most part is good, unique and tricky.  There are puzzles implemented into most levels that require some sort of brain function for you to complete them.  Sorry CoD players, there are no hands being held in this game.  There are around 16 missions in this game which have enough content to keep you playing them for a while.  The missions take you to different locations which is cool because who really wants to spend most of their game time trying to pull down a star destroyer in a frustrating QTE scenario? Now back to the game that is Dark Forces,  the pacing of this game is very fast so if you are really up for it, speed runs are available.  Just to conclude on the missions in Dark Forces; THE SEWER LEVEL.Overall, Dark Forces is a game that I thoroughly enjoyed and it was really surpring how well this game plays for it's age.  I can guarantee that if you are a gamer who does not mind playing a 90's pixelated shooter, then you will most definitely have a lot of fun with this.  9/10 "

As for gameplay I prefer this over Doom any day as the challenges are perplexing and sometimes you'll be shooting for your life the others you'll be trying to kill an enemy you can't really see (monsters in the sewer mission).

												Dark Forces is a window into gaming in 1995. Often labeled a Doom clone - and deservedly so - it is an evolutionary step in the fast evolving landscape of FPS in the mid-90's. We're not quite at Duke Nukem 3D in terms of gameplay and technology, but a little ahead of Doom II. Approach the game with that mindset, it shows some age. This is no Quake.That said, it is a polished and fun game for its time. Its presentation is top notch: full voice acting and cutscenes, Star Wars score and sound effects, early 3D models. Every level is challenging, sprawling, filled with traps and feels different thematically and visually. You will visit just about every Star Wars staple.Among the game's shortcomings are the auto aiming that sometimes fail to target enemies at different heights, platforming elements that make it hard to appreciate distances and an uneven difficulty. I recommend the game, but with the caveat to take the game from the perspective of when it came out.			"

												A relic of my childhood, and a reminder that once upon a time games didn't always hold your hand, trusting you to find your way through pixelated labyrinths. Dark Forces, as a result, is absorbing--an engrossing experience that forces you to really explore and engage with increasingly complicated, difficult levels. That sense of getting lost in a world makes it all the more real--and that's a good thing, especially in a pre-Prequel Trilogy setting that does an excellent job of recreating the feel of the Original Trilogy universe.

Using official Star Wars sound effects this makes for an enjoyable game that doesn't feel like it had licencing issues. Giving us the alternate story of Kyle Katan it makes the game feel like it was a scrapped Star Wars film. If you like DOOM or Star Wars than this could be the game for you.			"

												The start of the Kyle Katarn series.  A great raycasting game.First and formost, if you cannot code or configure your dosbox controls, you're gonna have a bade time.  If you do not know what dos box is, you're going to be unhappy with this game.That said, this is a very old game with very old design choices. You are going to have to put yourself in the mindset of the mid 90's gamer and computer user to enjoy this game.That said, its a blast to play.  There is a quality aesthetic to this game that was quite consistent in the rest of the Katarn games that made me enjoy it very much.  The Lucas-verse felt like a place, somewhere you were in, rather than just another level.  Sewer monsters, Gamorran guards, thermal detonators, blaster rifles, everything felt on point.'That said, the only issues I have with it from a gaming perspective is that there is no save system, so you're going to wind up memorizing much of the levels to get through them healthy and in one piece.  The back half missions have boss battles that ....aren't bad, but aren't great as well.  The Corescant mission felt like I was fighting the AI more than anything.  The fuel depot mission was similarly confusing in that exactly how you were to accomplish the objectives was a pain that look my lateral thinking ability to solve.But all in all, this was a fun game, I enjoyed blasting imperials.If Disney were to put a new FPS out, I'd only ask for something between this and Dark Forces 2, but minus a certain type of weapon near the end.But seriously, learn to configure your dosbox setting so you can have a proper resolution and control setup.

												I am writing this recommendation as it will get me my 10th treasure hunt whatever thing, and therefore enter me into the grand prize of domination thing on Steam.Dark Forces is one of my favorite games of all time, everyone should play it. This game has it all, badass Kyle Katarn, Star Wars, FPS, great storyline, many varied and awesome locations, and the ability to be modded. Some of the mod levels imo, are more developed than some of the modern games I've played today. When I think of Kyle Katarn, I think of DF, not his later bearded self, though the EU later establishes that he is still a total badass.			"

												One of the very first games I played as a child back in the 90's, Star Wars Dark Forces is without a doubt, one of the best Star Wars games I have ever played. This game is similar to Doom 2, where the levels are fairly linear, finding keys to locked doors is a necessity, and there are several mini bosses that you will encounter. I personally am not too much of a graphics freak so the pixels do not bother me, but that should not turn anyone away from this gem of a game. I bought this game during one of the sales (Summer/Autumn/Winter) at around $2. While the replay value is very low as there are a set number of missions with no achievements or multiple endings, you will get your $2 back and more. Pass on the coffee or candy bar and do not miss the rare chance to be able to punch a Kell Dragon in the face.*The game requires DosBox however, with the Steam download, everything will be set up for you to enjoy as soon as the game is downloaded.Story/Characters:You follow Kyle Katarn before his Jedi days as a Rebel mercenary. In my opinion, the story is a tad on the darker side when it comes to Star Wars. The basic premise is that you are the hero as you try to defeat the Empire with their new Dark Trooper project.Gameplay:The gameplay is very straightforward as you clear levels by going to the end/objective. There are no Force powers, lightsabers, or Jedi. Point and shoot at baddies shooting back at you. Thankfully, there are no escort missions.Graphics:The game is from the 90's.Sound/Music:Enemies will grunt and scream/squeal as they are shot/blown apart/punched to death. Music is always superb from John Williams, although after a while, the music for the missions will continue to loop.Controls:By today's standards, in my opinion, the controls are not so good. You will have to use the arrow keys to move and with the mouse, you can only look left or right. To look up or down, you are forced to use the Home and End keys. There is a fix for this however, in the form of a file called ""Glovepie"" which allows you to use your mouse to look in all directions.Replay value:There is little to no replay value as there are no achievements. I suppose if you want to run through the game by changing the difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) you could play three times or start a playthrough with only fists.Online:None.---***If there are any mistakes to the facts pertaining to the game, please let me know. Also, if you have further questions not covered by the review, or if something were unclear, I will try to clarify as best as possible. Thanks!			"

												Even as just a simple game for the DOS, STAR WARS™ - Dark Forces impresses me even to this day. With its own unique storyline, decent graphics for its time, and edge of your seat gameplay, this game defies all expectiations. I admire the different missions, yet sometimes I feel lost navigating the dark and sometimes downright scary corridors, but I digress. Hey, it's DOOM with Star Wars, What more could you ask for. This is still a great game to this day and I always have fun playing it. I reccomend this game to fans of the Doom franchise, first person shooter fans, and for all those Star Wars fans searcing for that lost hint of nostalgia.			"

												Although being in 16-bit this game very accurately captures the feel of being inside a Star Wars film. Using official Star Wars sound effects this makes for an enjoyable game that doesn't feel like it had licencing issues. Giving us the alternate story of Kyle Katan it makes the game feel like it was a scrapped Star Wars film. If you like DOOM or Star Wars than this could be the game for you.			"

												A relic of my childhood, and a reminder that once upon a time games didn't always hold your hand, trusting you to find your way through pixelated labyrinths. Dark Forces, as a result, is absorbing--an engrossing experience that forces you to really explore and engage with increasingly complicated, difficult levels. That sense of getting lost in a world makes it all the more real--and that's a good thing, especially in a pre-Prequel Trilogy setting that does an excellent job of recreating the feel of the Original Trilogy universe.

												Dark Forces is a window into gaming in 1995. Often labeled a Doom clone - and deservedly so - it is an evolutionary step in the fast evolving landscape of FPS in the mid-90's. We're not quite at Duke Nukem 3D in terms of gameplay and technology, but a little ahead of Doom II. Approach the game with that mindset, it shows some age. This is no Quake.That said, it is a polished and fun game for its time. Its presentation is top notch: full voice acting and cutscenes, Star Wars score and sound effects, early 3D models. Every level is challenging, sprawling, filled with traps and feels different thematically and visually. You will visit just about every Star Wars staple.Among the game's shortcomings are the auto aiming that sometimes fail to target enemies at different heights, platforming elements that make it hard to appreciate distances and an uneven difficulty. I recommend the game, but with the caveat to take the game from the perspective of when it came out.			"

												Star Wars: Dark Forces is perhaps the most faithful adaptation of a property from one medium to another that I've ever seen. For lack of a better term, it  feels  almost exactly like Star Wars, from the style of the environments to the witty banter between characters to the sound effects to the kid-friendly violence. The stormtroopers, in particular, are pitch-perfect, yelling ""Hey! Stop!"" and the like at you before getting shot and melodramatically falling over. It perfectly captures the original films' sense of breezy, fun adventure that gets tense at times, but appropriately so, and never enough to kill the fast pace and pure enjoyment.Aping the style of the original Star Wars films is all well and good, but Dark Forces manages to be a solid game as well. Old-School FPS is a great genre, as wel as perfect for capturing the tone discussed above, and Dark Forces pulls it off particularly well. The gameplay is smooth and enjoyable, the weapon variety is excellent, the difficulty scales well, the enemies are diverse and most fill their niches admirably, and the levels are generally easy to understand and navigate, although occasionally they slip into maziness. There are also puzzles that actually require some thought, but at the same time are intuitive to solve (think of Half-Life's Blast Pit). The story also deserves mention, as it's good by current game standards and fantastic by 90s game ones. Before each mission, you're treated to a briefing that tells you what you're doing and why you're doing it, as well as how it connects to the overarching story, which is always good. In addition, there are some barely-animated but well-acted cutscenes that further the plot. It's an enticing package.Dark Forces also has some never-before-seen (at the time) technical features that were important to the evolution of FPS as we know them today, including a jump button, a crouch feature, fall damage (for better or for worse), and multiple layers in one level— not the way Marathon has, but instead simply starting a new map whenever the player reaches a certain point, such as the top of an elevator. This simple solution would be the workaround of choice for 2.5D games for years.However, Star Wars: Dark Forces has a few detrimental design decisions which relegate it from 'all-time classic' to 'flawed masterpiece'. Some of its weapons and enemies are superfluous (Why are there two different rapid-fire weapons that seem to do the exact same damage and fire at the exact same rate, especially if one is more accurate? Why does that more accurate weapon share an ammo pool with a weapon that also seems to do the same damage, but fires far more slowly? Also, I can understand that there might be two basic-level enemies that only practically differ in firing rate and amount of health, but why three?), and the two bosses seem to die far too easily. There're also what appear to be infinitely respawning enemies at some points, and though it's not excessive enough to be a major issue, it's a fundamentally bad decision in a game with finite resources. The levels, as mentioned above, sometimes get a bit too mazelike, and occasionally there's some really unintuitive♥♥♥♥♥♥going on regarding where to go and which buttons to press that requires help from a walkthrough.However, the greatest problem that Dark Forces has, the one that almost kills the entire game at times, is regarding saves. There aren't any. Instead, each level you are allotted three respawns (plus an bonus one or two each level if you can find them). Once you die, you are sent back to the last invisible checkpoint with one less respawn and 100% health and shields. However, all enemies that you killed and objectives that you completed remain dead/completed. When you run out of respawns, you have to start the level over. Some may not have a problem with this system, but I felt almost dirty using it, mostly because I couldn't come up with a viable explanation for how this was occurring within the context of the game. I actually refrained from respawning at all during the first few levels, opting to redo the entire level instead. I gave this up after it became too much of a chore during the sixth level, but the uneasiness remained. I may just be weird for disliking the system (although I do believe that quicksaves are objectively better), but I dislike it nonetheless.Even with its serious problems, though, Star Wars: Dark Forces is an excellent adaptation, a good game, and a veritable barrel of fun. I recommend it highly.			"

												Growing up I was one of those kids who had a mac (and hence limited games).  Dark Forces was one of the few with dual compatibility and hence was replayed incessantly.  Was so happy to see this classic on steam and replaying it 15+ years later didn't disappoint.   It is defintely a classic - complete with flaws such as nearly impossible to see (or reach) hidden areas, no save points and memorization of enemy locations and patterns, but that is also what makes it fun.  If you are looking for a blast from the past, this is a good option!			"

Camera is locked so you can look only left and right .

												This game is a classic FPS.  I purchased this and played it the day it was originally released.  Along with the original FPS Wolfenstein 3D & Doom, this holds many fond memories of wonder of playing the new and developing FPS genre at that time.  I recently replayed this game and hearing the music, sound effects, the storm troopers yelling at me, etc... brought back the original wonder from when I first played it.I introduced it to my 14 year old son to see what he thought of the game, especially since he is used to today's standards of graphics.  He played the game through in its entirety in a surprising short time and shared that he really liked the story line and had fun playing it.  If you are old enough to have experienced this time in this time of historical game development, you will love replaying (or discovering for the first time) this FPS classic.If you are among the PS3 &4 / Xbox 360 & One / modern graphically perfect PC game generation, it is a great game to play to experience how some of the original FPS games were like and how they laid down the foundation for games today.If you are a Star Wars fan, it has a good story line.  You will love how the first level plays right into core plot of Star Wars Episode IV.  PLEASE NOTE:  If you get weird color renderings on the walls, ground, sky it is not an issue with the game.  The graphics for this game was designed at a time when graphics cards could only only handle a limited amount of colors.  You may have to adjust your settings for running this file to limit the graphic colors in order to render correctly in the game.   "

												This game is a PC classic. You play as intergalactic badass, Kyle Katarn, as a Rebel agent who has to break in more enemy bases than Tom Cruise can♥♥♥♥♥♥on. Uses a heavily modified Doom engine that allows larger, much more detailed worlds to explore, with multilayered buildings, detailed cutscenes, immersive music (complain about the dated mini soundtrack while not trying to whistle to the theme song or the Detention Center's action music), and many weapons with various functions, such as a BFG plasma minigun cannon that shoots rockets. The soundtrack features iMuse, which allows a varying soundtrack that changes depending on what is going on. Even for a 1995 game, it still impresses me, and it is one of the first games I have ever played in my life. It's also a bit scary, from sewer monsters to giant kell dragons to hovering black balls of painful ""British Made"" syringes and torment. Also, thermal detonators: have fun with those, raise lots of hell.			"

												Been a whiles since I played this bad boy, but I recollect it not holding up so well in contrast to its direct sequels. Particularly the level design, leaving us players to wander the very open, very maze-like Star Wars-themed DOOM levels for a bits too long.It does tend to feel repetitive as you progress, too. Too many encounters feel the same, too many times you're left to search for a key card until oh! you finally find it--but where was that door? Maybe I'm the minority there, but both times I've played Dark Forces that's the sense of distaste I had creeping up on my general appreciation for the game. It's worth a look if you're a DOOM fan or if you're wanting to play the Jedi Knight series. Sets up the story decently for a mid-'90s EU video game. I guess....			"

The game has a great soundtrack made of synthesized versions of the film scores, impressive cutscenes for the time and has a plot full of lore from the Expanded Universe. It seems primitive now because it's essentially a re-skinned Doom, but nobody ever said that was a bad thing. This is pure old-school run-and-gun action with a Star Wars skin, and the beginning of the legendary Jedi Knight series.

O_OSo, may the rifles, pistols, missiles, mines, and other firearms be with you! -_^This is a kind of different way to fight against the Empire, and you must try it!Just a hit: it never hurts to know where in the Gamefaq is a walkthrough for this game :-P			"

												The best computer game since Wolfenstien 3D of its era, it was a breakthrough in first person shooters. If you have not played this in years it’s a must. I have to thank the minds in steam behind the resurrection of this game. If you played this as much as I did back in the mid 90's the nostalgia comes out in the voice overs, sounds and sights of this classic game. A must revisit for any fan.			"

												What happens when you combine DOOM and Starwars? Well you get Starwars:Dark Forces . If you liked Doom and Duke nukem 3D you should feel right at home . I had this game for PS1 and loved it but this version might actually be slightly worse because of glitching screens .Unlike Doom and Duke this game is not moded to look pretty and controls like PS1 version . Camera is locked so you can look only left and right . You can shoot up and down only from certain distance .The charm of the game is mostly awesome sound effects of blasters and screaming stormtroopers.As always you need a little nostalgia to play games like this but I am glad I bought this .Blast from the past .

												Been a whiles since I played this bad boy, but I recollect it not holding up so well in contrast to its direct sequels. Particularly the level design, leaving us players to wander the very open, very maze-like Star Wars-themed DOOM levels for a bits too long.It does tend to feel repetitive as you progress, too. Too many encounters feel the same, too many times you're left to search for a key card until oh! you finally find it--but where was that door? Maybe I'm the minority there, but both times I've played Dark Forces that's the sense of distaste I had creeping up on my general appreciation for the game. It's worth a look if you're a DOOM fan or if you're wanting to play the Jedi Knight series. Sets up the story decently for a mid-'90s EU video game. I guess....			"

												This game is a classic FPS.  I purchased this and played it the day it was originally released.  Along with the original FPS Wolfenstein 3D & Doom, this holds many fond memories of wonder of playing the new and developing FPS genre at that time.  I recently replayed this game and hearing the music, sound effects, the storm troopers yelling at me, etc... brought back the original wonder from when I first played it.I introduced it to my 14 year old son to see what he thought of the game, especially since he is used to today's standards of graphics.  He played the game through in its entirety in a surprising short time and shared that he really liked the story line and had fun playing it.  If you are old enough to have experienced this time in this time of historical game development, you will love replaying (or discovering for the first time) this FPS classic.If you are among the PS3 &4 / Xbox 360 & One / modern graphically perfect PC game generation, it is a great game to play to experience how some of the original FPS games were like and how they laid down the foundation for games today.If you are a Star Wars fan, it has a good story line.  You will love how the first level plays right into core plot of Star Wars Episode IV.  PLEASE NOTE:  If you get weird color renderings on the walls, ground, sky it is not an issue with the game.  The graphics for this game was designed at a time when graphics cards could only only handle a limited amount of colors.  You may have to adjust your settings for running this file to limit the graphic colors in order to render correctly in the game.   "

												This is a really great game to be honest. Some of the mechanics in the game are weird, like using Page up and Page down to aim up and down. This game still holds up to todays standards and has a very nice storyline going along with it. The only real thing I don't like about this game, is that it's one of those ""Where do I go"" kind of games, like Half-life/Portal and other similar games. It can take awhile to figure out where to go, but it's better than most games where the path is simple and have hordes of easy enemies to kill. TL;DR; Very great game, you play now.			"

												Personal Rating: 10/10Replayability: LowBudget: Worth it. Length: Originally it took weeks. Now it takes months - honestly I didn't get this to play it to the end, it was a case of nostalgia. I played this game when I was a kid, it was some of the greatest gameplay available at the time. It's still not bad by comparison. It supports a mouse now, which I don't remember it doing originally, but only one mouse axis works, and you have to use keyboard to aim up or down. There are no crosshairs, but aiming is pretty easy. It's very old! You know this if you're looking it up, but it works - even on windows 10! Dos Box is automatically installed and run as part of the exe file. Don't buy it for any other reason than nostalgia though!  "

It magnificently gives a feeling of atmosphere came from the movies, the moments of battles - exciting!Pros:- diversity of of all the maps to beat, that makes nervous to find an exit- also, all the objectives are quite logical to be interrelated and understandable- clever AI- size of maps, that makes the player get confused and crazyCons:- incompatibility with several DosBox builds that the community suggest and share.

												Okay, imagine Doom but with a story written by now Telltale employees, and subjectively a much more enjoyable atmosphere with great visual and sound design for its time. Level design is pretty much the one single complaint I have about it as it can get confusing and overwhelming quite easily. It lacks direciton. But considering it is one of those old shooters that depends completely on its level design, it's basically the game, meaning that complaint is quite a big one.

http://bosniannerd.blogspot.com/2015/02/star-wars-dark-forces.htmlDark Forces. If you were playing games back in 1995 you most definitely know about this first person shooter and you are probably wondering why I am writing about it in 2015? Honestly, the game was included in a recent game bundle and I decided to check out how well did it age. You know, some games may be awesome at the time they were released, but as the time passes and games evolve, some of those old favorites end up being very bad. And we wonder how come we loved them so much back then and now they seem like games we'd never play for more than 15 minutes. Anyway, before I move on I want you to know that I didn't really like this game even when it was first released. Just as I didn't like Doom, a game that Dark Forces was too often compared to. I didn't dislike it either, I just thought it was an average Star Wars game and an average FPS and it was well accepted just because it was set in Star Wars universe.So, how well did it age? Not good. First of all, you need a DOS emulator (DOSBox) to run it on a modern computer, but if you are using a Steam version of Dark Forces you don't have to worry about it as Steam was nice enough to set up DOSBox for you. The resolution is extremely low (640x400) and everything is very pixelated. There's another solution for this (and more) called DarkXL. DarkXL allows you to play Dark Forces even in full HD (1920x1080) resolution and/or in a window (as I prefer it). It doesn't just stretch the pixels as you may have thought, it really has new game textures and makes everything look a lot nicer. Don't expect wonders though, the graphics are still more or less the same, it just looks a lot more polished.By default, you use mouse only to look left and right and if you want to look up and down, and more importantly shoot enemies who are above or below you, you need to use PageUp and PageDown buttons on the keyboard. Actually, the game will usually shoot up and down automatically if you line up the reticle with the enemy, but it's extremely frustrating and unforgiving at times. DarkXL fixes this as well as it allows you to use fully use mouse and view your surroundings. Trust me, this helps a LOT and not only with shooting the imperial scum, but also with switches and doors.However, DarkXL is incomplete and will probably remain so. There are certain bugs that have been reported and the most important are present in the very last level. You will be unable to complete the game with these bugs (you will have to cheat to advance and to give you a hint: hold G to move through walls) and it's a real shame. Especially since regular save game file is incompatible with DarkXL save game file, meaning you cannot just switch back to normal game and complete what's left regularly. Another annoying bug (or a missing feature?) is lack of weapons. If you play through the game using DarkXL you will be unable to pick up the strongest 2-3 weapons for a reason unknown to me. You can use another cheat to unlock and equip those weapons though, so it's a minor issue at the end.Now that you know how you can enjoy the game better using DarkXL, lets get back to the game itself. The story is mostly unimportant: you are Kyle Katarn, a mercenary who works for Rebel Alliance. You are being sent on a series of missions to find out about the latest Imperial project and ultimately destroy it. An army of Storm troopers, Imperial commanders and commandos, droids and other aliens will stand in your way as you progress through 14 levels consisting of mining facilities, space stations, cities and other environments. The levels are average in size, have no respawning enemies and will take an average of 30 minutes to complete (more if you play on hard since you have to be more careful). Most levels will require you to find switches, cards or buttons to open up certain doors in order to advance. However, I hated that part a lot. Why? Simply because you will often run into a switch or a lever, use it and... wonder what actually happened? The levels are not linear and you can wander around as much as you want, and as good as that is it confuses you because you are not sure what did that switch do. There is no ""objective pointer"" to tell you where to go (this is a 1995 game after all) and it's especially frustrating in missions where you have to go back to your ship after you complete the mission. I walked around for more than 20 minutes on one mission, looking for the starting point in order to complete the level. Frustrating! I tried using the in-game map as well, but since you can go up and down in elevators, the map adjusts and doesn't really help at all. Ah yes, you cannot save your progress during the mission - it is auto-saved after each complete mission so don't expect to load the game and see where something is before returning to your ""real"" save.At the end I played through Dark Forces' 14 levels using DarkXL and it didn't feel rewarding at the end. The game is not hard, the story is nothing special and there's no special ""accomplishing"" feel once you are done. Again, I never liked Dark Forces much and I played through it some 15 years ago just because I loved its sequels, but that's an entirely different story. I didn't rate the game as I usually do because... it's just not easy to rate a 20 years old game, especially since it really did not ""age"" well.Have fun!			"

												Fantastic old game that initiated the Jedi Knight series. Lots of fun blasting those stormtroopers, unique maps, cool cutscenes, good Star Wars atmosphere. Doesn't get old and it doesn't matter it doesn't have superb graphics. Game mechanics are comparable to those you might know from good old Doom. Steam version has modified controls to more modern WSAD + mouse, which is convenient although mouse still doesn't let you aim vertically. But that's not a serious problem. The game runs through DOSBox and has no issues at all for me, although I had to modify one DOSBox graphical setting to avoid one problem. Fortunately Steam forum for this game is very helpful. One problem: no Steam chat overlay. Oh well... It's really worth playing anyway.			"

												For starters I will be playing this via DOSBox.  Because unless you have an old Compaq Presario 5528 with Windows 95 on it sitting in the closet, you will too.  Which means, that since DOSBox is pretty much a requirment to play the game, I’ll be including it in the aspects of the review.As I have said before, and I’m sure, will say many times again.  I wont ever down an old game for its graphics.  If the game had bad or poor graphics, in relation to competition at the time of it’s release, I might.  But so long as things are at least par for its time, I wont argue it.DOS Box is a neat little program that allows older DOS programs to run in the Windows environment.  It’s noting too fancy in that regard, but it does allow for a complete control customizing, something Dark Forces would otherwise be without.Dark Forces graphics are great for its time, and a strain for the eyes now.  This is one of those games that I don’t expect a lot of people to go run out and play.  If you’ve been playing Battlefront II all weekend and then try to play Dark Forces.  Well, its gonna suck, plain and simple.  Especially if you’ve never played it before.  But again, this isn’t me saying this is a bad game, just uncontrollably dated graphics.The story is excellent, giving the means to tell it.  There is the backstory, that unfortunately is not with the Steam version since it was in the original game manual.  But with a quick Google search can be found easily.  The meat of the story is told in short cutscenes and the mission briefings.  With the occasional comments from Kyle Katarn as you play.I would absolutely love to see someone remake this game.  Using a modern engine, or ever just a less dated one.  Yea, it was tried, but that project was recently canceled.  It does strike me as odd though.  With Dark Forces being a landmark game.  For all gamers, not just the Star Wars nerds.  It seems like someone should have done this, and done it fully some time ago.  This is what people want.  If it could have been done with Doom, it can be done with Dark Forces!The level design is better than I expected.  It doesn’t follow that flat maze and corridor style I was expecting it to have.  Perhaps I’m thinking too much about Wolfenstein 3D?  There are places that could use improvement, but then when isn’t there?  And they make great use of the multiple floors, remember that was a big deal when this game came out.  So of course, there are stairs everywhere.Dark Forces is one of those games where you can take your time and take in the sites or just run for it.  Either way you play it you get pretty much the same experience.  A sit down with it, will show what gaming was like ten plus years ago.  You wont be blown away by anything by any means, but you might gain a little more admiration for the old school.An excellent game for what it is, but unfortunately, doesn't hold up well to modern standards.  Which to be honest was completely expected.			"

Doesn't get old and it doesn't matter it doesn't have superb graphics. Game mechanics are comparable to those you might know from good old Doom. Steam version has modified controls to more modern WSAD + mouse, which is convenient although mouse still doesn't let you aim vertically. But that's not a serious problem. The game runs through DOSBox and has no issues at all for me, although I had to modify one DOSBox graphical setting to avoid one problem. Fortunately Steam forum for this game is very helpful. One problem: no Steam chat overlay. Oh well... It's really worth playing anyway.			"

												Amazing game until i reached the end and the final boss battle was just to simple. For a game that made for the playstation 1 it is certainley a must have even to this day in age. From voice acting to animation there is something hear for star wars and First person shooter fans. May the force be with you and get this game absoutle must have. Good things. Voice acting . Storyline . Arsenal of weapons. Puzzles Bad Points. Not much of a challenge. Modern day computers through dos box can cause a few animation issues			"

												I know it's not really fair to criticize a game so many years later, and you have to appreciate the major leaps forward that Dark Forces made. But when every mission inevitably gets bogged down in a long and boring hunt for key X or door Y that you somehow missed along the way, even the nostalgia wears thin. The solution is rarely a rewarding find, rather its just a well hidden door that is an awkward U-turn from another door.			"

												It's awesome. Simple shooter with a bit puzzle. I have no idea what I was doing but I still enjoyed it so much. -This is what I thought...until mid game with tones of landmines and grenadesThis is only my personal opinion. I could have been spoiled by mordern FPS or I might simply be a bad gamer. So be open minded and see why some people support this game, and why I do not.The control, for me, is totally S**T. You need to use the numpad to look up or down, and you have a max/min angle. In the start it does not really matter since auto-aim can sometimes work and you do not need to manually aim very often if you are will to take a couple hits. Yet, when enemies can throw grenades with insane distance or have 30pts attack, if you are not a big fan of old school fps and suck at it just like me, you will have a hard time. Moreover, no one teach you damn sh*t unless you look up to tutorials and guides.The graphics make you sometimes extremely hard to see enemies, platforms or stuffs. Added to the control, you can be ambushed or get lost for stupid reasons. There are countless places that you might miss unless you look at the map or walkthough since it was so not obvious.The enemy movement is a big F**K YOU. They keep wandering IMMEDIATELY once they cannot see you and may not come to the aid of their allies in the area. So you might though you secure the area then suddenly an enemy attack you. Added to the fact that there are platforms that are above/below you so you are likely to not be able to reach at the instance so you cannot check the place.The pizzles were kind of confusing, but usually not that paintful. After a while of exploration you can make it out even if you do not understand how it works. Yet this also might take lives. No explanation or manual can be loot/find in the area and cause extreme frustrations.The landmines mechanic is the extremely painful. You can hardly see them as they could be hide in the dark/behind an object/next to healing objects/bad graphics; they cause insanely high damages; enemies will not trigger them; you can use grenades to tigger them but throwing a grenade accurately is hard af and I personally could use up to 3 to destroy a landmine.All in all, if you are not a extremely patient person, do not do this to yourself.

												This is one game I am glad I accidently stumbled across. The Dark Forces/Jedi Knight is the beginning of one of the most enjoyable SW series of games available on PC, and its roots are still worth looking into.The Canon Solution: Ignition Start, Soar Elsewhere UnexploredWe all are aware of the recent trend of SW games being tied to the SW canon. A lot of these games, as a result, feel worthless in their stories as we all know what happens whether or not we play the game. It also has the unfortunate side-effect of making the player ask, ""So? Why should I care?"" about these spin-off stories that don't do anything different.Dark Forces only brings the canon to give context (time and place) at the start, then lets the story go on its own territory with its own cast of characters. The first mission is to steal the Death Star plans (Ep 4).  After that introduction, the game leaves the canon behind for Kyle's Kataran's story. You are on a mission to stop a mysterious project for the Empire called Dark Troopers. The plot is bare-bones, but the character progression fits the SW universe.Kyle Kataran, a combination of all the lovable qualities of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker. He was once an Imperial Officer. As you learn throughout the game, he went rogue and performs duties with the Rebel Alliance--for a certain price, of course, or sometimes out of his own generosity. Kyle is a simple character, but he becomes more interesting in later games (not simply for being a Jedi). For an introduction to Kyle Katarn, it's interesting to see how a non-Jedi character can play a vital role in the rebellion from the Empire, especially for the Doom-esque genre.Not only are the characters memorable, the atmosphere in this game is perfect. Sometimes dark and claustrophobic, other times laybrinthlike and open to exploration (and there is a lot! I never found all the secrets in any of the stages). While there isn't a complex story-arc, the story is servicable to add some depth. I only find this interesting as this was always something lacking for me whenever I play Doom or Duke Nukem 3D.Aim Somewhere Between Doom and Duke Nukem 3DThe controls are top-notch despite being a Doom clone with no free-aiming. The only issue, which you don't have to use often because of auto-aiming, is tilting the screen up with the Page DOWN key and tilt the screen down with Page UP key. (Who programed this nonsense?)In missions 3 - 6 there were some pretty cryptic nonsense that will aggrivate you, but the later puzzles are beatable with enough perception--I liked the puzzle on the Imperial City that I figured out alone. Enemies are nicely varied, there are tons of weapons that feel, mostly, different and the maps are HUGE. Bosses, like most FPSs, are pretty lackluster and just require you to spam your heaviest weapons and to dodge their attacks. They are somewhat specatular or given some context to make them feel more threatening than other enemies.Levels consist of completing certain objectives and either returning to the LZ at the start, which can be tricky to find for some levels, or heading for some exit. The only level I despised for its maze-like quality is the Prison level, but the others feel expansive enough and meaty to serve for enough gameplay. There are some other old-fashioned quirks that you have to adjust to in order to enjoy this game. Besides the resolution and sprite-work which, for the most part, looks great when up-close but a pixely mess from afar.The first is the ""lives"" system. Die several times, you lose the mission and you have to start over. You cannot quicksave mid-mission (only after it). The lives system reminds me an awful like Rise of the Triad as you can earn more through finding tokens or you can earn a 1-up with enough points. And similar to RotT, there are SOME platforming sections. Nowhere near the amount of platform issues as with RotT; they just feel out of place for the game. Lastly, some guns share ammo, so be wary of using the same ammo type.This is no push-over of a game. The difficulty doesn't feel as difficult as NIGHTMARE mode on Doom, but I remember toning it down on the later levels because of how often I got lost or frustrated because of the lives' system. I don't think the difficulty should be a concern of yours unless you've never played a Doom-like game before.Only The Beginning...As the start of a well-loved series, this game is a classic mired by problems within the FPSs of the time. Sure, it doesn't do anything new, gameplay wise, but what it does it does well along with the treatment of the SW lore done right. These qualities make it a worthy game as the gameplay works and the story keeps you engaged to play more.You will feel like you are a flickering flame of rebellion fighting an oppresive threat that has its hold on the Galaxy. With each new challenge you must adapt to new enemies and locales. And in the end you don't defeat the Empire; you make it aware that its ending reign is on the horizon.How can you not love this true-to-heart Star Wars game?Unless you're a hipster.			"

												Even though I haven't played this in 20 years it's probably better than I imagined.  So many nostalgia unleashed from playing, from enemies to sounds, parts of levels, entire levels.  Some was better than I remembered and some mainly just from a graphical stand point was a lot worse.  If you like star wars and can get past dated graphics this is a great game.  If you like shooters like doom 1/2 or wolfenstein 3d or duke dukem 3d then you will like this game.  Nice level design, pretty damn easy on easy, medium was met with a challenge.  I found myself repeating some levels and sometimes getting stuck.  I could play a level for over an hour, be stuck on something, die and come back and beat it again in 10 minutes, so there were some frustrating momemts, but overall a goood game.8/10prosStar WarsNice level designFamiliar enemies and places10 weapons is a lot for even games that are released todayPretty good storyconsold- things such as graphics are lesser, or things that would be impressive, such as having cutscenes and  objectives which weren't the norm back then, are now.enemy variety could have been moreif you don't get as stuck like me, its a bit short at only 12 or 13 missionsIf you love star wars or old school fps buy full price.  If you love star wars and have issues with bad graphics get it on sale.			"

												first off i just want to say that this is a very odd star trek game it seem to parodize the star wars franchise in the beginning with the return of a phantom hope theme song and the rolling text which i by the way wasnt able to read because it was rolling too fast and because yellow is such a bright color and it made my eyes hurtthe first enemny you meet also kind of looks like a stormshgooter but the sprites are so low-res that its impossible to tellthe first thing i noticed about the gameplay is that you can walk in every direction and look both left and right which is a good thing because you will need to be able look both sides to be able to complete the gamehowever what i didn't like about the gameplay is that instead of scripted jump events you can just jump whenever you feel like it and that kind of ruined the immersion for me..... i mean jumping around liike a looney toons character isint going to kill any klingons.... what were you thinking gorge lucas?????the shooting however is the best i've ever seen in a cover based first person dungeon crawlerthe develoeprs of this game knw that people dont really want to aim.... they want shoot lazers and look cool while doing itsecrets is abig part of the game there are so many secrets in the game i dont know where to begin sometimes if you nlow up a wall and sometimes you can find another weapon that shoots a different kind of laser and that is kind of c00lthere are also more levels than i have fingers that is really neat \m/something i really dont like about this game however is that there arent that many klingons in the game and when there are they have 3 eyes and all they do is to throw grenades @ you.... i expected more from them tbh i also didnt like the lack of waist-height obstacles to take cover behind......... that is very importatn 4 this type of gamehowever...... even if this is a very odd star trek game i would recommend it because there are so many things to shoot at			"

												Now, I know what you're thinking. You see the red thumbs down and you think I'm going to complain about how this game is old.No. This is an enjoyable game. It is not a bad game by any means. However, it is true that it is old. It has aged, pretty badly in some parts. The reason I am not recommending this game is because there are much better games out there on Steam that can be bought for $6. Hell, you can buy the original Deus Ex for just $7, and that's one of the best games ever made, hands down.It really depends on how much you're going to enjoy the game. If you have played this game back in the day, and you have nostalgia for it, it might be worth the price. However, for me, who hasn't played this game until 2014, it wouldn't have been worth it. I got this game in the Jedi Knight Bundle, so I don't feel like I've wasted any money. Overall, I would only reccomend this game to the nostalgic, and even then, they probably own it already. To everyone else, I would say no, due to the abundance of better alternatives for the same cost. Even then, I recommend saving up to get some of the better games on Steam, like GTA V, MGS V, or Deus Ex.EDIT: It says that I have less than an hour into the game, but that's because I mostly played the game through the XL engine. I have about 1 or 2 hours into this game, I believe.			"

												Maybe this game used to be great in the hey days of 2.5D FPSs, but to me it feels more dated than Doom or Duke Nuke'Em 3D. While those other titles seemed to have pixel-perfect, artist made sprites; the sprites Dark Forces appear to get their basis from scanned photos and retain that muddled, pixelated look. Another fault is there are so many grey walls with low resolution textures that it is easy to get lost in the levels due to the lack of recognizable landmarks. I am sure that die-hard fans of old-school FPSs or Star Wars will find a lot to like, but for me I'd rather skip this and move on to Jedi Knight 2, which has both the better visual representation of SW and better gameplay.

												A great fps (first person shooter)It incorperates a lot from the original triology of movies (episode 4 a new hope, 5 the empire strikes back, 6 return of the jedi) like sound effects, the droid sounds, the speech by npc's, characters, enemies etc.this has levels that are very big and confusing (multiple levels that cross over each other)there is no in level saving but you do have livesthis might turn of newcomers but once i found this quite exciting cause failure was punished harder because of this but with lives not to much.the graphics are good for the time but the enemies in the distance are somethimes hard to see but at close to mid range they look great. the graphics are the only thing that hasn't aged well.the controls take some getting used to becauase they are fixed. but once u are used to those controls it's feels like second nature.but because this is played thru dosbox the controls can be altered.8/10 for a great fps with a lot of star wars fan service			"

I had played the Wolfenstein 3D and Doom series, but to see a Doom clone that was Star Wars was too much for me to deny.  And not only to be a clone, but to improve on the formula.  This is Golden Age LucasArts at it's finest.  I still pull out the old Pentium Pro system to play this game.  Highly recommend with DarkXL Mod.			"

												I hate Star Wars. I just don't get it. I find the films dreary, dull and unwatchable, and certainly can't understand the intensity people rave about them. The merchandise produced alone is enough to bury the Matterhorn, and frankly I couldn't care who shot first. There you go. Click the 'downvote' button and move on.I love this game though. Superficially it feels similar to the ""Blood""-era BUILD engine, with the lightness of movement and spacious surroundings, but it's very well constructed. The levels are interesting, logical and practical. The puzzles are slightly more interesting than ""use red key on red door"", the AI isn't bad for it's time, and the graphics and sound are top-notch. If you like old-style FPSes, you can't go wrong with Dark Forces.I'll skip the cut-scenes though, if you don't mind.			"

												It's an important, old game. Old as hell and I love Star Wars, but this one outdates me. Get used to getting lost a lot unless you're used to doom-esque feeling games and their maze-like, backtracking levels. Kyle Katarn is op though and you can't stop him (NICE TRY THOUGH DISNEY).			"

												Star Wars: Dark Forces is an ok old-school shooter. A lot of things that can be said in favor of and against this game, but the Steam version is actually unplayable. Your accessories are bound to the f keys which did not work for me. I looked online with little success, although others seemed to have better luck getting them to work properly. The only reason I do not recommend this game is the inaccessability of the accessories, which are necessary to complete the later levels. The other pros and cons tend to balence out.			"

												I remember playing this game back on the PS1. The main character is a badass who works as a Merc for the Rebellion. Due to this flexibility, he isn't a main part of the alliance, but he certainly perfers it then working for the empire.The story to this game is you play as this character during the events of Star Wars Episode IV, and V I believe, it has been a while since I completed this game. The first mission involves you doing something none of the other Rebel Infiltraitor's had done, retrieve the blueprints to the death star. As any Star Wars fan knows, the plans are what revealed a weak point in the Death Star's defences and the leader even mentioned how they lost many men attempting to get that information.You are then called in because a Rebel base when silent from an attack, but this was no ordinary attack as the entire base was taken out and if it was a army, they would've seen it coming and evacuated or atleast shot many of them down before going into hiding. It's then revealed that one of the most interesting enemies of the Star Wars franchile is created here. The Dark Troopers. Commando Troopers that are far more powerful and destructive than you're average trooper as they can take out entire complexs by themselves.Many weapons you get are references to the ones from the film such as blaster pistol, blaster rifle, Thermal Detonator and quite a few interesting and creative weapon designs.It's well worth a play if you can get a hang of the controls and remember how Lucas Arts used to make years ago as this was during the age they made adventure games and before they went lax and started making half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥games.

												I felt kind of odd recommending every single game I own and finish here, so before you take this review as a big strong NO, accept it in the context of my library – if there is one game in my library I would not recommend thus far, it would be this one. It’s not because of technical issues or my hate of the game, I actually quite like it, but since I played it before, I’ve decided to play it on hard this time around and it revealed a couple of issues this game gained by aging very, very poorly. First off, the controls. The look up and down buttons are mapped somewhere to the numpad and thus every instance of looking up or down turns into an ordeal. It’s especially annoying when an enemy surprises you by standing on a heightened platform or straight under you, because you learn about it the painful way and before you can react accordingly by adjusting the view, your shield is dropping like vases in cartoons. There’s no in-game ability to remap the keys either. What’s more surprising – no mid-level saves, so screw up right before the end and prepare to rage quit. Now before you think of me as some amateur noob, let me assure you that that’s a thing that crossed my mind as well. But there’s challenging and then there’s straight broken ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. So if there is a turret placed on the ceiling of a maintenance tunnel/ventilation duct, doesn’t make a warning sound and is able to blast your bum from here to Tatooine with spotless accuracy, that’s just bad game design. When a mine blows my jacket straight off, because the only warning of its position behind a crate is a short beeping sound signaling that I just entered a domain of pain, I would enjoy at least a single checkpoint. This game is not a Doom clone, despite looking like one. It’s packed with ambitious innovation, which is alas very poorly implemented. And if you turn the difficulty up in Doom, that game at least has the decency to lift you off the tracks after shoving you under a train. This game, on the other hand, will shoot your kneecaps as soon as you scramble back onto your feet. And if you don’t plan on playing this game on hard, or conversely at least don’t mind putting your face to a cheese grater, then you may just enjoy this old fossil.			"

While it is a good throwback game with simple but fun shooting there is not enough here to justify the purchase.  If it is on sale for 2 or 3 dollars then by all means pick this up but i dont think it is enough fun when there are so many better things to spend $5.99 on. KOTOR, Battlefront II, and the other Jedi Knight/Dark Forces games are just better.			"

This is the game as it was released back in '95. I didn't play it back then, so non-nostalgic commentary.It runs on DOSbox and is build upon Doom, so the controls, movement, environment, enemies and pickups look the same. But Dark Forces has a slightly better graphic, additionally voice acting and cut-scenes. All of these are remarkable for the year of release.Sadly I am not recommending this game because I couldn't pass through mission 2 (also had trouble on mission 1), even though I tried for sometime. It's not intuitive, after activating a lever/button you simply don't know where to go. Places sometimes feels like mazes. If the problem was a puzzle or a riddle I could have looked for a walkthrough, but needing it to continue a game's storyline is a lack of level building.If nostalgia hits you, take it, this game wasn't touched by the time. If you want a first person Star Wars shooter, leave it, there are better. "

												Full ReviewAlot of people are complaining about this game because of problems and stuff. There are pretty easy fixes. I have used Dosbox once and my game was crashing at start and I easily fixed this. Just do some research. Anyway Pros and ConsPros:- Anything not on the con listCons:-No tutorial or manual-Non canon story not worth paying attention to-Like someone else said in a review it feels like your on ice which can cause problems on the platforming bits.-Graphics (Not really a con cause I quite like them but other people don't like them)Other than that the game is really good. I recommend getting this on sale though because I don't think 6 dollars is worth it for a older and buggier game but non the less a good game.P.S. THE GAME IS FROM 1995! IT IS 20 YEARS OLD STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT MISSING THINGS THAT ARE ONLY IN MODERN GAMES!			"

												pretty fun to play, but it is a VERY old game indeed, so you should keep that in mindi. Story is interesting and combat is fun. Everything from the enemies to the weapons is very lore friendly and well done. This game however may get very frustrating because some of the levels are mazes and you have no idea where you should go or what you are supposed to do. So get it if you're either really into star wars or really into retro gaming.			"

Posted: February 9, 2015
												I LOOOOOVED this game in 1995.  It was the first thing I bought with my first paycheck when I turned 16 that year.  I love star wars, and I love doom.  Except this game had a better plot, cutscenes to support it, and some nifty tricks like jumping, crouching, and looking up and down.  Due to the last of those, the level design is genius!  You really have to explore, as keys are often hidden in little side areas rather than be guarded by groups of MOBs.  Back then it looked amazing, although 20 years later not as much.  Although, the graphics are really not all that necessary, as those mid 90's FPS's are all about gameplay and level design.  I miss this.  I cannot stand FPS games where basic enemies are bullet sponges.  I get bored if I have to put 8 or more rounds in every basic enemy.  These games are more ""realistic"" in the fact that you can clear the guards out of an area to perform your espionage, with a few well placed blaster rounds.  Only droids and hearty aliens like Gamorreans.  You may even get to punch a Kell Dragon to death ;).  The introduction of Kyle Katarn and the whole Jedi Knight series does not play like the followups.  He is not a jedi, and you get no lightsaber.  However, at this time period in Star Wars lore, the amount of Jedi is down to a couple tops, including a couple geriatrics and a 19 year old kid.  Getting to play a part in the rebellion to help dismantle the Empire is pretty cool for any Star Wars fan, and the gameplay will satisfy any retro FPS fan.  I do recommend looking into the XL engine.  It is a free fan made sourceport, currently in alpha.  It runs the game pretty well, and makes it much easier on a modern gamer.  Full mouselook, right click to use, and an overall refresh of the graphics.  Just textures, no new models or anything, but since the Jedi engine is not released, the guy had to build a new engine.

												I played this game on a Mac back in the day and got it on Steam for the nostalgia.It seems to run fine but the game itself is notably worse than I remember, presumably due to the difference in version.The graphics are worse, lower resolution to the point where you cant really make things out at all.  This sucks because the original game I played was really quite beautiful as far as textures setting the mood.  This version is just a blurry mess.The sound is also worse.  I remember the cheese midi sounds from my old Mac version but these seem to be even worse, spoiling the mood completely.If you've played an older version, especially the Mac version, and want that nostalgia, don't get this because it is far worse.If you have never played Dark Forces before and are interested, don't bother, it is a terrible game for someone with modern gamining sensibilities.

												This game plays much better than DOOM in my opinion. It's a great fast paced shooter with no hand holding, and has some great improvements over DOOM story and gameplay wise. The story is pretty straightforward; you're a bounty hunter for the rebels, tasked to go on a variety of missions (Such as retrieving Death Star plans). Shortly after the Death Star's explosion, the Empire has unleashed a new threat on the galaxy; Dark Troopers. The story will have you enrgossed through its dry wit and dark humor, while still keeping the Star Wars vibe.Must play for any Star Wars fan			"

												Dark Forces was a groundbreaking game back in the day.It was an FPS that wasn't about just finding a switch at the end of a level to move onto the next level. The enemies were actually varied and different strategies were required in the levels.The visuals were amazing, and the sound was incredible.As you might expect, the standard for all of these things has increased monumentally, so this title isn't quite the media spectacle it once was. It's probably not even worth playing through again, even if you have fond memories of it as it has not stood the test of time very well. But at least it can still be remembered for laying the foundation for the first-person shooters of today.4/10 ""Poor""			"

												I got this game during a star wars sale and was excited to see some of the earlier lore. I've enjoyed it some, but overall its just a bit irritating. Like some other people have said, ""you will get lost very easily"" and when you get to mission X I will be surprised if you find yourself doing anything other than talking angrily at your computer screen. This game serves as a prime example of many elements in games that developers had yet to smooth out (and no, I don't just mean that its old; there are problems with more than the limits of the days technology). As soon as the implementation of mines starts this game moves from possibly difficult to punishing and you will find that you have to remember things about the levels and replay them to move on with the story. I would only recommend this game if you love Star wars and don't mind being frustrated and having to be persistent or use cheats (at least supposing that you like to play games on hard mode like I do).

YouTube™ Video: star wars dark forces- How's It Hold Up Years On Review 

			Views: 307		

			I’ve been playing a bit of dark forces a first person shooter made in 1995 by LucasArts. Dark forces is set at the same time rouge one, just before a new hope. how does it hold up 22 years on?		

 I had this when I was a kid and enjoyed the nostalgia trip I got but I don’t think dark forces holds up that well it still fun and I had a good time but the mechanics have dated and being lost all the time was really frustrating. I just moved on to other games that weren’t so frustrating. I feel that you could spend your money and your time on better games.  "

												I recieved this game, along with many other Star Wars games in a Humble Bundle I bought, and I have attempted to play it, but I really honestly cannot continue. I did not play the game when it came out, or Doom for that matter so I did not really find the experience nostalgic or fun. The game has very dated graphics, along with the fact that you are unnable to look up or down, which proves extremely annoying. The levels can get very confusing and as the objectives are unclear, I have often found myself wondering what the heck I was supposed to do.To sum it up, I would honestly reccomend this to old-school gamers, or adults for the nostalgia, as people like me will not find this entertaining if you a used to playing recent first person shooters.

A Guide for STAR WARS™: Dark Forces
By: MagicDN

			Playing Star Wars: Dark Forces with widescreen and Full HD support.		


 I don’t mind old games if you can fix the old issues, I loved Brutal Doom, so old games can age well if designed well. Dark Forces sucks in almost every way compared to most Doom clones unless you’re a super fan of star wars The levels are expansive and layered and I bet at the time this was cool, but this just makes the game tedious to travel as it takes a while to around as it’s easy to get lost This games has puzzles per level that aren’t hard to solve, it just requires pushing a lot of buttons in an area that aren’t hard and just break up the fighting, The first 2 ones were lame and I couldn’t push myself to care to finish if this is what the game had in store The weapons are mostly laser rifles and I think this shows a problem in the star wars universe that if all weapons are laser rifles it’s hard to mix it up. I got the blue laser rifle and laughed as it wasn’t better or served a different purpose than my storm trooper rifle. LOL The environments look nice and the story has cutscenes that are a treat for fans of the star wars lore. Overall I might be able to understand when this came out it was cool, but after playing the Jedi Knight series, it does everything this game can’t. Maybe I played them out of order. Regardless this game is poorly designed and that's something even mods can't fix My Score: DPaid: Included in $12 Humble BundleMain reason for dislike: The puzzles were tedious, pointless and weapons are lame Similar Games I think are Better:  Duke Nukem Shadow Warrior Strife Jedi Knight 1 & 2 (the best star wars style games) "

												Before i write this review  i wanted to say i wasn't sure if i should give it a positive or negative review. Obviously, by today's standards, this is a terrible game. But you also have to take into consideration that it was made in 1995. So it certinly wasn't going to be great. So, I'm going to write about some of the good and bad things about this game, I only gave it a negative review because i enjoyed many games made in the 90's. This game, however, is not one of them. The only reason I bought this game was because of how much I loved Dark Forces II, So i figured I would enjoy this game just as much. But they're both completely different games. First off: You will get lost VERY easily. There's never any clear indication as to where you're supposed to go. You do have a map but that really doesn't help. So you'll spend the majority of each level wandering around and going a bunch of places that don't lead anywhere. The game is also pretty easy combat wise. You'll almost never die, (although, i did only play the game in medium difficuilty) All you'll do is see something move and just hold down the left mouse button until he dies in one or two shots. It;s also a bit confusing at first. When i had completed all my objectives it didn't take me to the next level. Confused, i just wandered around for awhile figuring i had to find an exit. After awhile, i got a message saying i had to pause the game and click next mission. This was more than likely my fault i'll admit. It probably sent me that message as soon as i finished all my objectives when i wasn't paying attention. But it's still odd and confusing. It actually has a pretty good atmosphere. At one point it was even pretty creepy. During the second level you have to go down this water drain and you'll end up in this really dark room in waist high sewage water. After i walked around for awhile i heard a sort of growl. It actually creeped me out quite a bit. As i continued i heard more growls but i still couldn't see anything. Until, finally, i ran smack dab into this octopus looking creature that emerged from the water my immediate response was to hold down my fire button until it died. It was actually quite jarring. All-In-All, It wasn't a horrible game, it's just not a game for most people. If you like games like DOOM then you'll probably enjoy this game. But, if you're just a fan of Star Wars or just saw this and it looked interesting. I would suggest not buying it. "

DarkXL by Lucius makes this game less dated, but no less insanely difficult. This game is worth the buy if only for Kyle's brilliant Nick Jamesonian persona in cutscenes.Update: Insanely hard to optimize, record, and edit game footage. Takes at least 24 hours of continuous work to learn everything needed to stream and record footage. 2/10.			"

												Star Wars: Dark Forces is pretty much Doom: Star Wars Edition. You're thinking ""That's great then! What's the problem then?"". Well, a lot actually...The story starts off with a defect from the sith empire stealing the death star plans for the Rebel alliance, setting itself up for what starts off tieing in to Episode IV: A New Hope, but then goes off in it's own direction, including Dark Troopers as the Siths new method of ruling the galaxy, and you, the defect, have to stop them. Nice idea for a story, but the dialogue is so corny it's difficult to take seriously.The core gameplay is Doom in a nutshell. Running around what are pretty much mazes, blasting stormtroopers that can hit something and occasionally collecting keys to open doors you found earlier that you couldn't open, with the occasional mediocre puzzle thrown in... and that's pretty much it. Backtracking is far too common in this game, which is a let down, and the platforming... Don't get me started on how bad that was...The sound effects that we all know and love from Star Wars are there (no Wilhelm Scream though...) and the music we all know and love is there as well, including the music played during the Death Star attack from Episode IV.One final note: Why did I have to look online for the controls to this game? Why wasn't there an option to access the controls ANYWHERE in the game? It would have helped me out in the first 4 or 5 missions. Playing around with the Gamma Correction in the options menu and shooting was not what I wanted to do to navigate dark areas thanks.It's by no means the worst Star Wars game, but it's definitely not the best. However, it was definitely a bad start for the Jedi Knight series and not worth your time, unless you're a diehard Star Wars fan.			"

Nowadays, it's a fun walk through memory lane, but it certainly doesn't stand the test of time with games like Half-Life and and Portal on the market.  Don't waste your money getting this, as the shoddy controls and bad level designs (by today's standards, of course), will make you red in the face with anger.			"

The mouse does not control looking up or down so you have to scramble across the keyboard just to clumsyily aim while getting shot up. That and the large and bland environments filled with sparse texture variation while you run past them at high speed can lead to disorientation and confusion on where you are and what the hell your supposed to be doing.Yeah, it's not really fun to play.

A few graphical bugs but a quick google can usually offer a quick-fix.			"

												10/10 you can jumpIt really is a good game if you like Star Wars and old school FPS games like Doom and Wolfenstein 3D. The game is about Kyle Katarn who steals the Death Star plans in the beginning. Afterwards it skips past A New Hope and goes into it's own story where the Empire introduce their Dark Trooper Project. The graphics aren't too great but that's not too important, plus it's old and they were good for their time. Gameplay is good and it's pretty much Doom except, as I mentioned before, U CEN JUMP 2PRO and it's also one of the first games to feature multiple floors. Overall if you like old school shooters and Star Wars I recommend the game.			"

												As much as I like to lament the rise of the linear, corridor shooter, Dark Forces' level design is a proper counter argument to the growing sentiment that Doom-era level design was inherently superior. The environments' visual simularity makes it hard to differentiate areas you've already explored and the maps sprawl and twist with hidden nooks and crannies that, in most games, would be secret areas but, here, are necessary to find and explore to progress.If this sounds like it's going to be a negative review, I've misled you. Complaints on level design aside, the story is pretty great, especially for a shooter from this era, and the gameplay is challenging and frenetic at times. Your movement speed is akin to an F1 car and the weapons are satisfying in a Doom rocket launcher sorta way. Blasters shoot with violent rapidity and mowing down stormtroopers doesn't get old quickly.I played through the entire campaign on medium when it was new (I'm old), and played through about half of it on easy here. On easy, I would finish most levels with max armor and health, on medium I remember things getting hairy a few times.Worth it for nostalgia if you played it the first time and for morbid curiosity if you've never kicked the tires.It's hard to imagine playing everything at this game's resolution back in the day. Such pixels.			"

												How can you not love this classic?  A brilliant FPS in the Star Wars universe that introduced us to Kyle Katarn.  It can feel a bit dated when you play it and it takes a bit to get used to not being able to look up and down with the mouse but the game is packed with interesting, challenging (and occasionally frustrating) puzzles.  The story is also fantastic and for its time the game did a good job with the music and sound.			"

												Have you ever wanted to play a game that's poorly structured, devoid of real action, strays from the main events which can be found within the history of the Star Wars universe, and lacks the ability to make the player (especially one who harbours feelings of such great affection and admiration towards the Star Wars franchise in its entirety) feel nostalgic? Well, if so, don't purchase this game, because, if you're seeking any of the above traits, you're sure to be disappointed - Star Wars: Dark Forces, is an exceptional work of game design. Though it is, in fact, the case that the game's graphics aren't of an overly high quality by the standards of the gamers of today's society, I can say that, despite this, it is still quite an impressive game; the various methods of, shall we say, ""neutralizing"" hostile units are all quite entertaining, and, though the game may be slightly old, the movement within the game on the part of the character is remarkably smooth. Never have I once found movement to be even the slightest bit, ""laggy"", no matter how vigorous my travelling has become. Look, I'm not saying this game is great - I'm just saying it's awesome considering the sale price, and that, for this, and numerous other reasons which I won't even begin to attempt to list, you should definitely buy it.

												This game takes me waaaaay back. I had gotten this game with the Star Wars Pack and I had thought that I had not played it before but this was the same game I played back in my child hood. Its amazing and nostalgic to here the 8-bit star wars theme. I had to reduce my monitor res from 1080p to as low as it will let me and play in window mode for me to get a clear picture but it is soo worth it. Reminds me of doom among of the other old school shooters. The story line is good and the 3d cutscenes are not bad given the time that this game was made. This game is worth a play through, such a great classic game!			"

												Hey, everyone! This is my first review and I'm brazilian, so I'm sorry in advance for any grammar mistakes.Dark Forces I is a First Person Shooter developed by Lucasarts, it came out in 1995. In this game, the player takes control of Kyle Katarn, gun for hire and ex-imperial officer. I'm not sure if this game is canon, but we find out how the Death Star plans were stolen from the Galactic Empire - that's the first mission, setting the stage for Episode IV. After Katarn steals the plans and the Death Star is destroyed, the Empire develops a new weapon to unleash against it's enemies, and it's up to Katarn to investigate and neutralize the threat. One curiosity about it is that Dark Forces I is the game that introduced the ability to jump and look up and down.My time with Dark Forces can be divided into three distinct eras: After it came out, my parents bought the cd for me to play. I found the concept of FPS - it was one of the first shooters I ever played, along with Doom and Wolfenstein 3D (the first game I beat) - very fun and interesting, and I'd already seen the classic trilogy. Shoot imperials, blow up facilities? Sounds fun! I was very little (seven or eight, I think), and I used the in-game ""cheat"" which can be acessed in the options submenu: super shields. I didn't know that it was some kind of cheat, so I thought the game was too easy. The third level was difficult, but I managed. Until the sixth level. There was no way I could figure that puzzle out - I didn't even know there was a puzzle - and, after some game rage, I went to real cheat codes. Ah, the scum and villainy... I beat the game like that, using super shields and level skip whenever I got stuck.In the second era, some good six years later, I was determined to beat all levels, but still using cheat codes - ah, the scum and villainy II -. I finally figured the puzzle out - didn't take long - and I felt really dumb. Was I a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ kid? Maybe.And we come to the final era. I've decided to give this game another try, this time without any cheat codes, and on hard difficulty. Not surprisingly, I died a few times, especially against some certain kell dragons. Damn it, that was hard. But I did it, and I for certain recommend this game, for nostalgic reasons, to see how the First Person Shooters evolved and to see how Kyle Katarn began his journey!			"

The levels are limited because of the age of the game, but for the most part they did a great job funneling you around and introducing obstacles to make them seem much larger. Not to mention it just looks good for such an old game... something about the 2D graphics are really appealing, even now after Call of Duty 9000 with super HD graphics and MoCap animation and all is on the market.It feels retro, and retro feels great.

It is also quite difficult, it will be a challenge to complete it even on the lowest difficulty setting. Skilled players can complete it in roughly 5  hours. Highly recommended, even after 20 years since release (at the time of writing of this review).			"

Especially if you're a Star wars fan. Great game, leads to an even better game and series of games. You  might have tweak it, no worries, if you put the time in to tweak it to get it to work on your newer system (lets face it, unless you have windows 95 you have a newer system) Youll be in for some pure first person shooter fun. :)			"

												For me this game represents the beginning of the age of the shooter. Doom and Wolfenstein were good, but DF provided a feeling of story and purpose that made each map more than just a key hunt. Also, it had 3D maps! No more flat runs!			"

												Ancient Proto-FPS. This prequel to the Jedi Knight series is basically like Doom or Wolfenstein, but with Stormtroopers. You play as Kyle Katarrn, before he becomes a Jedi. You basically just infiltrate various Imperial Installations and blast things. The story is all breezy, and involves espionage for the Rebel Alliance, mostly about the Death Star, in advance of the plot of the first Star Wars (the real first one, not Episode 1). That's about it. The game is too terribly long, but not too short either. Basically get it if you enjoy nostalgia, both in Star Wars EU and very early shooters, and it is on-sale cheap, or part of a pack.			"

												I used to play this for the original Playstation back in the day. I enjoy it even more now, than I did back then. It's amusing trying to play it without being able to look up or down, but other than that it plays pretty decently for a game that's as old as it is. All Star Wars fans would enjoy it, I think, especially if you enjoy the EU/Legends-verse (or whatever they're calling it these days) This was the first game in a strong series, starring the (at the time) mysterious Kyle Katarn. You're sent on missions to help the Rebels, you get to shoot at Imperials, and you even get a sidekick! Though sadly, she doesn't actually accompany you on the missions. A game I've been able to play over and over again and am happy to finally own on Steam as well.			"

												Runs fine on Win10...  So far I have had it running on an AMD64 (64b OS) and an intel atom platform (32b OS) - both Windows 10.  If you have issues with it crashing at start - make sure you have both dosbox and dark.exe (in your dark forces folder) set to compatility mode.  WinXPSP3 was used for my systems.  first try to start dosbox by itself - see that it runs.  You might even try to invoke dark forces by typing:mount c ..\Gamec:dark.exe  if the game runs then you can go from there and start editing the dosbox.conf file - first make a copy of the .conf file.  Then remove cpu=xxxxxx and also remove exit (last line in the file).  Additionally, change ""game"" to ..\Game (case sensitive just in case).    Once the game starts up - it may run exceedingly fast.  That's where you can go back to the conf file and re-introduce the cpu=xxxxxxx line to its original value.  If the game still runs entirely TOO fast, increase the left most digit of that number (originally 20000).  Hey - this game was released over 20 YEARS ago.  I wouldn't expect it to run flawlessly on every platform or the latest OS and processors today, considering it was made for x86 DOS platforms way back when processors were 133MHz single core and a math coprocessor was a luxury!  Hopefully that helps....Of all the new FPS games that were being released in the mid 90s, DARK FORCES shines as something that incorporated a good storyline with an anti-hero.  Several levels required a bit of thinking, a bit of skill, and plenty of storm trooper fights.  Additionally the build up of some of the big bosses were great - sometimes very tense.			"

												As much as I like to lament the rise of the linear, corridor shooter, Dark Forces' level design is a proper counter argument to the growing sentiment that Doom-era level design was inherently superior. The environments' visual simularity makes it hard to differentiate areas you've already explored and the maps sprawl and twist with hidden nooks and crannies that, in most games, would be secret areas but, here, are necessary to find and explore to progress.If this sounds like it's going to be a negative review, I've misled you. Complaints on level design aside, the story is pretty great, especially for a shooter from this era, and the gameplay is challenging and frenetic at times. Your movement speed is akin to an F1 car and the weapons are satisfying in a Doom rocket launcher sorta way. Blasters shoot with violent rapidity and mowing down stormtroopers doesn't get old quickly.I played through the entire campaign on medium when it was new (I'm old), and played through about half of it on easy here. On easy, I would finish most levels with max armor and health, on medium I remember things getting hairy a few times.Worth it for nostalgia if you played it the first time and for morbid curiosity if you've never kicked the tires.It's hard to imagine playing everything at this game's resolution back in the day. Such pixels.			"

												While this game is definitely dated, it's one of those few classics that's really worth playing even now. It's a DOOM-esque FPS with a bit of Puzzle/Platformer thrown in. The narrative is minimal, though it accomplishes what it needs to. It's probably noteable that this isn't really a ""The fate of the galaxy rests on your shoulders!"" story, rather you're a mercenary doing generally small-scale infiltration missions. The map design seemed a bit confusing to me at first, but you get used to it. I was flying through the final few missions and still collecting most of the secrets along the way.It's pretty short, but each mission is unique while being both challenging and fun. It's worth playing at least for a little bit to recognize the roots of the Jedi Knight series and some obvious inspirations for Shadows of the Empire.			"

												Incredibly addicting. It's actually a poop-ton of fun, if not just a bit aggravating. Levels are pretty good length, and there is no saving your game, except between missions. You are on a life system, meaning every level, you get three lives to finish the level. Usually not a problem, but the game isn't always easy. In fact there are times where I felt like some levels were just cheap at times (but extremely well-designed). For being the launching point for some of my very fvorite star wars games (jedi knight 2 and jedi academy), I absolutely recommend this game.Graphics 8/10, i guess? I hve no idea what the standard should be, but it's certainly good enough if you at least understand that you're playing a DOS game. Gameplay 8/10 Cool levels and puzzle like design, but gunplay is tough and some areas are littered with invisible minefields that just feel kinda cheap. Make sure ou grab the infrared goggles. Story 7/10 It's alright, but I bet it's downright impressive next to other games' stories of it's time. Lasting appeal: 9/10 I mean, 14 missions, took me a total of 23 hours to complete the game, which is a pretty good length. It's just fun, and for the price, it's well worth your time.			"

												A dinosaur for the die hard Star Wars gamer.My early childhood memories include playing this game with my older brother for hours on end back in the day but I can safely say that nostalgia alone is not the reason why I've continued to replay this game every now and then. While this game is simply old as dirt it offers a fresh and interesting experience the likes of which are rarely seen within the Jedi obsessed nature of nearly every other Star Wars game.You'll play as the mercenary Kyle Kattarn who gets the job done by the skin of his teeth. Relying solely on weapons fire and cunning to accomplish his missions rather than a swing of a lightsaber or force powers. Levels are similar to those seen in the older Doom, Duke Nukem or Marathon games where you'll explore secret Imperial military bases and the lairs of seedy underworld criminals in service of the then fledgling Rebel Alliance.While I can't promise that this game will sit well in most gamer's stomachs it will easily become a favorite to those who love dipping in to the past. For those gamers I highly recommend buying this old school title immediately.			"

												Star Wars - Doom, Doom: Star Wars... no matter how you would call it, Dark Forces is really amazing game.Dark Forces wasn't my first Star Wars game. Played it for first time probably around Star Wars Episode 1 film premiere because it made to want to play everything with ""Star Wars"" in name. The only thing I was wondering when I will got lightsaber and have some cool Jedi fights but at the time, sadly, I was disappointed to see that I won't use one in this game. Many years later, in 2016, I wanted to replay it. To be honest, when it would be my first time playing, I would stop playing it few times. Why? First of all, nowaday gamers will have trouble finding their way to finish missions. Levels in Dark Forces are really complex. I laughted few times because I thought that finding a secret places in this game is much easier than finding actually your way trought mission and IT'S TRUE. Not that I hate it but let's be honest, how many games now have this much twisted level construction? Noone to very low... anyway, I love every each of levels. Those are filled with Star Wars - ever wanted to take a trip around Jabba's ship? No problem, there is mission like that! The next thing which really builds well this game are weapons - even tho there aren't any lightsabers, first weapons like blaster pistol or laser rifle are fun to use. Still, in my opinion, nothing beats Stouker Concussion Rifle - once you will get it you won't use any other weapon but be careful: it's powerful enough not only to kill enemies but poor Kyle Katarn too. Who is Kyle Katarn? Our main hero, former Imperial Stormtrooper, working as mercenary. Is he someone important? Well, because of his action there was some kind of event leading to ""moon"" destruction but for more you will need to play game by yourself.The graphics, music, controlls and everything feels really outdated but that doesn't mean it's bad. Years ago it was wonderful. Even the cutscenes looked amazing! As someone who loves to play old games it's still looks great but that won't be a case for everyone. I think everything gathered together builds a great Star Wars game. Sure, maybe you can't save game anytime you want like in Doom but levels aren't so long that you won't complete it at one sitting - there are some extras that will make your game a little more safe, so you won't need to start level at new when you will die. Three difficulty levels will also help you a bit to make your game fit to your taste but keep in mind, that even playing on easy won't be that easy.There is one more thing because of Star Wars being in Disney hands. ""Is this canon? It's not canon anymore, right?"" - does all of this talk really matter? Kyle Katarn is interesting character and it's fun to follow his story be it in games, books or comics. Dark Forces game is also fun to play, it will surely please every Star Wars fans, Doom-based games fans or everyone who just love old games. It's all that matters. I had fun playing Dark Forces and I'm sure there will be another chance to enjoy it over again.			"

												I enjoyed playing Dark forces. A game similar to the Doom/Quake style of gaming filled with Storm Troopers and everything you love about Star Wars makes for a very nice combo. The variation in guns meant you had a plethora to choose from so you can quickly find your style and choose your stride. The character development left a lot to be desired however and the story was just ok. The mechanics as I said before are very similar to Doom/Quake, but while this may bring nostalgia it kind of didn’t work for this game. Many times I needed to look up and down and when you can’t do it with the mouse there is a bit of a problem. Yes you can look up and down, but it is keyed to button presses. This makes the game slow down a bit as you have to either stop moving or stop looking around. Now this can be fixed easily with Xpadder probably or even a mod, but I just wanted to play my game and at the time didn’t think about it.That being said I felt the gameplay was overall solid and the story was easy to follow. The map was a bit hard to navigate and I did get lost a few times, but if you take your time and slow down, or do what I did and look up a play-through, you can make it through. Also punching giant lizards, sorry I don’t know what they are called bear with me I’m a Star Wars fan, but I don’t act like I have a PhD, was a lot of fun!I give the game a solid 7. It didn’t wow me, but it kept me playing and that deserves a solid score.			"

												Classic and only recommended to those who really want to peer into the past. This game is really good. The worst thing about this game are the controls... yes people they managed to screw up the controls to a game that is over twenty years old. The mouse is a bit too fast and it takes some getting used too. But this game was perfect when it was released. There is some percieveable lag due to the emulation. Plus the graphics are obviously terrible; and they haven't aged well. If you are under the age of lets say fifteen, I'd stay away from this game. You won't be able to appreciate it.			"

												Good FPS, slightly more advanced than Doom, but still feels pretty similar.  While undeniably showing its age--the map system and the maze-like levels with identical textures come to mind, the voice acting is still great and the Star Wars feel is clear throughout.  In some ways it holds up slightly better than its sequel, Jedi Knight, if only in that it's more stable and doesn't force inverted controls.Pros-Kyle Katarn.-Great action.Cons-Mazelike levels-That power station level with the constant darkness-Poor map system			"

												A classic FPS(or as they were called back in the day, a Doom Clone) set in the Star Wars Universe. I played this game originally on the original Playstation, and it was my first encounter with the expanded universe. I quickly fell in love with the idea and started buying the books..and it all started with this title.While this game may no longer be canon, it's still an extremely fun experience. If you are familiar with DOOM, then you know what this is. You run around, blast your enemies and press switches and gather colored keys to open doors. Typical 90's FPS gameplay mechanics.The game has held out really well over the years. The graphics obviously are dated, but not so much as to leave you scratching your head trying to figure out what that batch of pixels is supposed to be. Difficulty is fairly challenging. Not so much in combat, but some of the levels get downright confusing and might leave you lost.ProsStar Wars!Good graphics for the timeRuns well on modern systemsAuto-Aim!Classic look and feel adds to the Nostalgia.Most levels are funGood UIGreat storyConsNo longer Canon :(Dumb AILevels can get boring and repetitious. Mainly the sewer level.Clumbsy controls.RATING: 7/10 "

												Oh man, the memories! This was one of the first video games I ever played growing up in the mid to late nineties, and it has aged like fine cheese: pungent and stinky but delicious none the less. To those who actually remember the pre-sequel Star Wars era, this game does positiviely EVERYTHING right. The guns, the enemies, the locations, and of course the characters, are all done in a manner that is faithful to the Star Wars lore. When playing this game for the first time, everything feels new yet strangely familiar, which is EXACTLY how a Star Wars game should feel. You feel like you've heard the story before, but the manner in which it is being presented this time is unique and interesting. Atmospherically, this might just be one of the greatest examples of allowing level/character set the tone. Shiny Imperial starships feature well organized corridors patrolled by brisk, professional soldiers while filthy sewers are populated by dirty, grubby looking baddies with outfits that look like they've been cobbled together from trash and scrap. Gameplay wise, the controls aren't as tight as they could be, only highlighting the fact that the platforming in this game is clunky at best. The story is no where near as long as it should be, and features only twelve missions. Despite its length, the story does do a good job of pulling you in and engaging you, even if it is a little corny even by Star Wars standards. The difficulty level is right about perfect, however. It is challenging without being impossible, yet simple enough that you rarely feel frustrated by it. That being said, the missions can feel a little bit confusing at times and you will occassionally feel like you don't know what you're supposed to do. Finally, the game's visuals haven't aged well and definately don't hold up to the standards that gamers expect out of a modern FPS. In all fairness, Datk Forces was on the cutting edge graphics-wise in 1995, and could look a lot worse. Its outdated graphical look adds a nostalgia factor to the game and give it an endearing quality that few retro indie games can match.All in all, Star Wars: Dark Forces is most definately worth a play through. Whether you're a hardcore Star Wars fan or a gamer looking to play older games for the nostalgia factor, Dark Forces will scratch your itch and scratch it good. I would even recommend this game to any potential developers out there as a good lesson in atmospheric design. A true classic and an undeniable gem in Lucasart's crown.			"

												A Long Time Ago in a little house in Florida far-far-away...A five year old Star Wars Fan finally got a taste of what it felt like to blast Stormtroopers and fight the Empire in a game very reminiscent of classic FPS games such as Wolfenstein 3D and Doom. Little did this boy know that this would be the beginning of a long and happy infatuation with Star Wars Games.Dark Forces might be old and it probably won't go over as well to gamers used to the HD Graphics of games such as Call of Duty or Halo but for nostalgia or introducing younger gamers with simpler and easy to play classics, Dark Forces is a definate classic for everyone to enjoy.Now you might be wondering how an old game that ran originally on DOS works on a modern computer. The good news is that the game comes built into an emulator called DOSBox which is designed to allow modern machines to run old timey classics such as Dark Forces. It works perfectly and I've not experianced any hickups. The only problems you'll run into is in the gameplay itself as some of the controls are not as modern. The controls are automatically bound to the WASD layout. The biggest problem is that if you need to look up or down, you have to hit the page up/page down keys on the the keyboard but that's the worst of your problems. Most of the blasters autoaim to some degree so you don't have to worry about being presicely on target.So big thanks to Steam and LucasArts for bringing us this Nostalgia trip. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got more of those Imperial Bucket Heads to blast.May the Force be with You.			"

												Dark Forces is a Doom-style shooter, meaning that mobility, reflexes and map navigation are more important skills than aiming. Simply put, you run through maze-like levels and only have to point in the general direction of an enemy to hit him (no vertical aiming, its mostly auto-aim). I didn't grow up on Doom, but I have recently been playing lots of these earlier FPS games and love that style more than the contemporary style which is more about patience and aiming.If you enjoy this style like I do and have at least a passing interest in Star Wars, I don't see why you wouldn't enjoy this game. Environments are varied, each level is very distinct and the length of the game is perfect for a game of this style. Don't be fooled by the difficulty options either, these are 90s difficulties meaning that even the Medium difficulty is going to test your Skill (The last level had me frustrated beyond belief).The game also requires you to solve some environmental puzzles which are basically just ""hit this switch to open this door, and take this code and type it in there to progress""-kinds of puzzles, and they are actually not as easy as they sound, but definitely do-able without a walkthrough. Yes, you'll get stuck sometimes and won't know where to go exactly, but that's part of the fun here. It's not a perfect game to be sure, mostly because the game has plattforming sections (Again, no vertical aiming, and yet you are traversing through mountain paths... Imagine the plattforming!) but it works well enough, and the game is kind enough to give you just enough lives to let you mess up. If anything you can always use cheat codes to get you out of tight spots, but that would naturally be disgraceful.It was a joy to play through Dark Forces and it felt very rewarding to beat it on Medium difficulty. There's some replayability... I mean, you could beat it on Hard mode and find every secret there is, but I will personally not replay this game any time soon. Still, I would definitely recommend it! This is an older game that is definitely still playable. (Note: The Steam version worked without any hitch as it runs through DosBox, and it has keys bound to modern standards, which is great!  No problems whatsoever on Win 8.1 for me, so don't worry)			"

												Highly enjoyable. The graphics are dated to say the least, but the fast pace and satisfying feel of the blaster rifle makes up for most of it. Also, I doubt you'd even be reading a review of a 20 year old game if graphics is a dealbreaker for you. What I would like to note is the level design. The levels are very distinct and all have a unique look and feel, despite the technical limitations of the time, you rarely find yourself running down endless corridors like in Doom. Also levels are more easily navigated than other early FPS games, and keycard hunting is at a minimum. Some modern conventions for the genre might be missed, but it's a very enjoyable game despite its age.			"

												Star Wars - Dark Forces is a First Person Shooter published by LucasArts in 1995 originally for MS-DOS and Apple Macintosh Computers. I originally got it when the Star Wars game bundle was on a massive sale on Steam. Out of the 10 games I purchased, I decided to try this one out first. Here are my first impressions of it.Graphics - 9/10: The graphics in this game are very reminiscient of Doom and Wolfenstein, both being pioneers for the FPS genre created by ID Software. It is in a pseudo-3D first-person view with pixelated textures. I give it a high score for being very revolutionary for its time, however, that doesn't mean it is perfect. The main problem is clarity. In both Doom and Wolfenstein, the graphics were clear, and you could see all of the walls, text and enemies just fine. In this game, I find that a lot of the time it is hard to see the walls and openings. This game managed to bring out the most that DOS could supply, so I give it a high score.Story - 9/10: From what I've gathered, the story of this gameis pretty much capturing data from the Death Star and bringing it back safely while fighting off Storm Troopers. This is exactly what you would expect from a Star Wars game, although I do take off a point for not much depth. The story is not particularly what you would care about, but it delivers exactly what you want for a Star Wars game.Gameplay & Controls - 5/10: As you can see from my score, the gameplay does have some serious issues. First though, let me get out all of the positives out of the way. The gameplay does give you a good sense of exploration and does a solid of job when it comes to shooting. As for the controls, they do seem standard for the average FPS and can be adjustable easily. Now let's get to the negatives. A serious issue I had with the game play is that whenever you enter a room, you are completely vulnerable to enemy attack without being able to see where they are. There have been numerous times when I go up into an elevator, then as soon as I reach the top, I have to turn around to exit while my health bar is being drained by an enemy that I cannot shoot. The game also is very unexplanatory, as I could not easily figure out all of the controls without some explanation. The controls, when you figure them out however, can be a bit weird to use if you have been previously playing a 3D FPS. You're locked into a left-right point of view, so you can not look upwards or downwards. There are flaws with the gameplay and controls, but they aren't terrible. That's why they get a medium rating.Summary: Overall, Star Wars - Dark Forces is not a perfect game, but still a good one. The gameplay could be better, but it is still a solid FPS and one of the better DOS games out there. For a price of only $5.99 without sales, I would consider it a good deal. I'm sure that there are better Star Wars games out there, but this one is still worth playing.Overall Rating: 7.6/10Hey guys! This was my first Steam Review. How do think it was? Please leave feedback, because I might do this again in the future. Thanks, and goodbye!			"

												Muhuhauahahahahaha. The Force is strong with Katarn..... if you mean to shoot every dude in sight. This game does not feature the lightsabre or force powers. Later games do. This game held cheese to its high standard and back in the old days, these cutscenes were the bomb. Now, you have to use dosbox and cannot aim with the mouse on a vertical axis.... unless you use Pg up or Pg down. I quickly googled the hotkeys and stuff to bring up dosbox options for fullscreen off/on, resolution, how to change key bindings, and such because that was not native back in the good old days. Dosbox makes this highly playable and there were no problems on an 8 core Win7 64bit. Thank God for DosBox. The Mysteries of the Sith , I need to play on my laptop because there are issues with multicore and other stuff. That is its own realm of crap. This game was full of missiles and guns and blasting and PUZZLES. Screw Portal, these puzzles were fun......... and you have to pay attention because no one tells you when you're done or not. You have to check it out, do trial and error, look for patterns, and find it youself. I liked this game and would say it was worth getting in the $5 bundle when it was on  Steam Sale.			"

It's kept simple with an auto assist for aiming, and you can't tilt up for down, but your blaster always seems to find its mark.  If you're a 90s kid like me, you'll love this.			"

												To those who may dismiss this as another Doom clone...I find your lack of faith disturbing. Star Wars: Dark Forces is very much its own game. It has all the fun of a 90's run-and-gun/FPS but it adds so much more. While playing as Kyle Katarn, you'll shoot storm troopers, solve puzzles, do some platforming, use cool gear (like ice cleats and a gas mask), set explosive charges, etc. I honestly didn't expect so much depth in a game that was so pixelated. This game seems to be ahead of its time. It seems as though the people at LucasArts wanted to create a rich Star Wars adventure rather than just a cheap cash-in on the newly emerged FPS genre. And they did a very good job considering the technical limitations. Anyone who likes classic FPS games should give this one a go. Though I needed a walk-through at times to make sense of the pixelated environments, I was pleasantly surprised with how much fun I had playing Dark Forces. +Original Trilogy Star Wars Goodness+Plenty of Guns and Explosives +Puzzles+Cool Missions +Simple But Fun Story+Occasional Voice Acting-Pixelated Environments-Difficult to Navigate at Times			"

												This game comes highly recommended from tons of Star Wars nerds I've seen online. And... well, yeah, I enjoyed it as well. It definitely scores high on my Top Ten SW games I've played. It's a fun little Doom clone, where you play as a Rebel named Kyle Katarn as you steal the Death Star plans before the actual Star Wars film, and later uncover the secrets of a new Imperial army- The Dark Troopers. Of all the FPS' I've played, where you just fulfill missions, this game makes you feel like you're actually making progress. As you go on, you learn more about the Empire, their design of the Dark Troopers, who's in charge, where the Dark Troopers are made, what they're made of. You end up feeling like a real Rebel spy, in the end. And I like Jan Ors as a character. She helps tell you your situations, fight of TIE fighters, while you're on the ground, and you save her skin once. While Kyle may be bland himself, it's what's going on around him that I enjoyed much more.			"

												[note: I played through most of the game using the XL engine (http://xlengine.com/) which adds a bunch of HD stuff, but it also graphically breaks some of the puzzles a little bit.]This game is over 20 years old, having being orginally released in 28/02/95. The level design may seem a bit awkward by modern standards, and the lack of quick saves/check points is also pretty annoying. You can find respawn items in the levels that will allow you to respawn a tiny bit back from where you died, while all the enemies you killed since remain dead, but thats about it. Some people may enjoy the level of challenge this gives. The sounds and weapon effects are actually pretty great, and sound more star warsy than some of the newer games.Having originally played only JK2 and 3, this shed some light on some of the design choices of those games. Playing through the Dark Forces and Jedi Knight games in sequence (not including Mysteries of the Sith) was very interesting and gives some insight into late 90s/early 00s game design developments, both graphically and ludologically. I would say the series peaked at Jedi Knight 2: Jedi Outcast (although the JK3 Multiplayer was good), and, if you include the force unleashed duo as part of the series, hit rock bottom with TFU2.

												It may have been a good game for its time, but now it is painful to play. Having to use page up and down to look up and down is very inconvienient, and it does not let you change the controls or anything. Also it was definitely not designed for a 1080p monitor. So it might be a fun game, but is just clunky and hard to play today.			"

												While this game is definitely dated, it's one of those few classics that's really worth playing even now. It's a DOOM-esque FPS with a bit of Puzzle/Platformer thrown in. The narrative is minimal, though it accomplishes what it needs to. It's probably noteable that this isn't really a ""The fate of the galaxy rests on your shoulders!"" story, rather you're a mercenary doing generally small-scale infiltration missions. The map design seemed a bit confusing to me at first, but you get used to it. I was flying through the final few missions and still collecting most of the secrets along the way.It's pretty short, but each mission is unique while being both challenging and fun. It's worth playing at least for a little bit to recognize the roots of the Jedi Knight series and some obvious inspirations for Shadows of the Empire.			"

												Ok, first I want to say that the idea of Star Wars meets DOOM is a great idea! For the most part the get it right. The music, the sound effects, even the sprites are spot on.My only complaint is that the shooting is crap, blaster fire goes everywhere! You will waste so much ammo in this game, unless you're right up in their face - it gets pretty bad at times.I will let that slide, though, because this is a game from 1995. Just beware, the shooting in this game is not as good as it is in DOOM, Quake or Duke Nukem. Good Star Wars game, mediocre shooter.			"

												The very beginning of Jedi Knight, if you play JKO/JKA, you should pay your respects to the original that, for if it had not existed, you wouldn't have been able to enjoy the modern games. The gameplay is quite fun, it's challenging, giving you a variety of weapons, more than some of its sequels, and allows you to play a more...'Soldier' or rather, Merceanary type role, as it's not just lightsabers and lunatics in Star Wars. Plus, the fights with some of the bosses, the Dark Trooper, and even in the last match, that right there, was a battle that is not seen much lately. If you own this game, do not stop playing until you've destroyed the Arc Hammer Project. If you do not own this game, then you are missing out. Own a JKA/JKO? Play this. Intrested in JK/DF? Play this first, you will not be disappointed.			"

												Ok so I played through it again (last time I played this was Win98) and it's definetly still overall a fun game.  It reminded me of how FPS used to have secrets that you can find which makes exploration worthwhile.  My only complaint is that something got messed up/lost in the port as you don't need to use the air/gas mask at all which actually makes it slightly easier.Also a sidenote the game ran like crap at first and you have to goto your ""Dark Forces"" folder in the normal x:\blah\steam\steamapps\common\ and goto the dosbox.conf and change a few settings to make it work well.  After changing a few my problems were smoothed out like warm butter.my settings that I did change or might have changed were[sdl]fullscreen=trueoutput = ddraw[cpu]cycles=70000			"

												You know those older games, yeah, the ones that don't let you move your crosshair vertically? This is one of those.It makes killing Imperial Stormtroopers a breeze. I mean, 360 no scopes are hard in other games, but in this one they're recurring.I could bother to do the math to figure out the limited array of angles in which your kill box ranges, but I'm too lazy to do that. I guarantee that a less lazy person could write it out though, because the number in degrees has gotta be low, i'm talking 360 degrees low, if ya know what I'm sayin'.It's decent. If you like Doom or Duke Nukem skinned to look like Star Wars, this is your game.			"

												Doom + Star Wars with some new things (Jumping, croching, items). A favorite of my childhood, I was surprised how well this thing has aged. Graphically, it still looks very good, the cutscenes are top notch for when it was released, and level designwise, it's superior to a lot of crap we get today. The story, while a bit bland by todays standards, went above and beyond most stuff from the era (Although it should be noted it's no longer considered canon for reasons unknown to me). The game features several weapons, most of which are really enjoyable to use. Honestly the biggest flaw of the game is that it's a bit short, barring some issues I will get to in a bit. Also if you are a younger gamer, the archaic design of the game may at times confuse you, definitly go look up a guide to find or change the controls. Fans of older FPS and star wars should definitly check it out (Although you probably already have). However... Whoever put this on steam didn't try very hard, it is running on a old version of dosbox and has very very poor default settings. It will run right off the bat, but you will really want to go check out some guides on updating dosbox and changing the settings to something that makes more sense. I haven't checked GoG for this game, but I'd assume they also sell it and they probably have it set up and optimized much better, just something to consider.tl:dr : Steam version is set up poorly by default, it's a great game though.

It is also quite difficult, it will be a challenge to complete it even on the lowest difficulty setting. Skilled players can complete it in roughly 5  hours. Highly recommended, even after 20 years since release (at the time of writing of this review).			"

It's really fun to shoot down stormtroopers and darktroopers, an enemy that is introduced in the game.

												Yes, this game is dated.  Yes, the controls are ""weird"".  Yes, the maps are confusing.  That said, for those of us who were fortunate to grow up in a day and age where this stuff was cutting edge, and weren't spoiled by games that assumed we were stupid and needed puzzles solved for us, this game still holds up as an awesome testiment to FPS history.Noted as being ""Doom with Star Wars Graphics"", Dark Forces took gaming to the next level.  The voice acting was simply superb for the day, as was the cutscene detail.  We were drawn into the galaxy of Star Wars and told a story that closely ties to the origional movie trilogy (before Jar Jar).  You were made to feel as though you had a part in those movies, without actually being thrown into them.  This great story would be continued in Dark Forces II, but we're not here to talk about that.For nostalgia purposes this game brings us back to a time when gaming was still searching for it's niche.  it's a time when ""WASD"" wasn't yet tied to a mouse as the ""accepted"" way to control a character.  You had to have both hands on the keyboard and learn how to multi-task your fingers, a skill that the youth these days would probably find confusing and too complicated.Level design in Dark Forces, easily the biggest complaint against the game, was very well done in my opinion.  Every part of the map is used in some way.  It's either a place to pick up more shields and ammo, or has a switch, or has an item you need, or has a secret you've yet to uncover.  There is no wasted space, and it's up to you to figure out what to do with it.  Sure, you can run around a map for 15 minutes trying to figure out the next step.  For those who are used to today's games leading them around by the hand it can be a little frustrating.  For those of us who grew up with these games, solving the challenge can be quite rewarding and we wouldn't have it any other way.Dark Forces was designed back in 1995, where the standard was DOS based gaming.  That said, in order for this game to function it's packed seamlessly with DOSBox.  I, personally, have never had a problem with games that are bundled in this manor.  The game is a perfectly emulated version of it's former glory.  There isn't any configuring required, unless you're one of those stubborn control freaks who needs everything to operate THEIR way.The only hick-up I ran into was remembering that at the end of each level, when your mission is complete, you have to hit ESC in order to move on to the next level.  That information was included in the origional guide (as I recall), and will eventually pop-up in the game if you spend a long time waiting for the level to end by itself.  It's a minor issue that's resolved at the end of the first mission, and as such doesn't change my recommnedation.If you've been spoiled by the high-end graphics and hand-holding of today's games then by all means avoid this title because it's not for you.  If you, like me, grew up with games like Doom, Heretic, Hexen, Decent, and Duke Nukem 3D then this is a MUST HAVE due to it's awesome storyline and great nostalgic value.  Its a testiment to early gaming and definately worth every penny.			"

												The very beginning of Jedi Knight, if you play JKO/JKA, you should pay your respects to the original that, for if it had not existed, you wouldn't have been able to enjoy the modern games. The gameplay is quite fun, it's challenging, giving you a variety of weapons, more than some of its sequels, and allows you to play a more...'Soldier' or rather, Merceanary type role, as it's not just lightsabers and lunatics in Star Wars. Plus, the fights with some of the bosses, the Dark Trooper, and even in the last match, that right there, was a battle that is not seen much lately. If you own this game, do not stop playing until you've destroyed the Arc Hammer Project. If you do not own this game, then you are missing out. Own a JKA/JKO? Play this. Intrested in JK/DF? Play this first, you will not be disappointed.			"

												Ok, first I want to say that the idea of Star Wars meets DOOM is a great idea! For the most part the get it right. The music, the sound effects, even the sprites are spot on.My only complaint is that the shooting is crap, blaster fire goes everywhere! You will waste so much ammo in this game, unless you're right up in their face - it gets pretty bad at times.I will let that slide, though, because this is a game from 1995. Just beware, the shooting in this game is not as good as it is in DOOM, Quake or Duke Nukem. Good Star Wars game, mediocre shooter.			"

												Star Wars: Dark Forces is an enjoyable clone to the FPSs of the early days of PC gaming. This game pretty much handles and feels like Doom, Quake, or Wolfenstien but with a Star Wars reskin and I enjoy that. It's mostly worth the little amount of dollars you have to pay for it. The only problem is modern PCs may have a slight issue with graphics, Google it and you'll have to mess around with some settings, but it's worth it. I'm giving this game a 6 Pi (~18.84) out of 20.

												The beginning of the Dark Forces / Jedi Knight series, and a true classic.Where to begin. The levels are limited because of the age of the game, but for the most part they did a great job funneling you around and introducing obstacles to make them seem much larger. Not to mention it just looks good for such an old game... something about the 2D graphics are really appealing, even now after Call of Duty 9000 with super HD graphics and MoCap animation and all is on the market.It feels retro, and retro feels great. It plays well, plays smoothly, and is pretty engaging in its simplicity.That classic 50-triangle Raven's Claw...And the 8-bit music.So fun.			"

												Star Wars: Dark Forces, is a old, odd, game. When I purchased it on Steam, several years ago now... I really didn't know what I was buying. Yes, I knew it was a Star Wars game, but the main thing that had me eyeballing it, was it's ridiculous cheep price. It was $0.99. One of the first things that surprised me was that it was an older game, Dark Forces came out in 1995 for MS-Dos. Which is why this game uses a pre-programed version of Dos-box to run the game on modern machines. I've played it on several computers, it seems to run just fine. Dark Forces is the first in the Jedi Knight game series, you play as Kyle Katarn, a young mercenary, a cross between Han Solo and Luke Skywalker. In the future games Kyle grows to become a Jedi Knight, but in this game he's just a mercenary. Gameplay is fine, think of a Star Wars meets Duke Nukem 3D. Dark Forces falls in from the time where 3D shooters weren’t quiet all 3D yet, a 2.5D pixel wonderland where you explore and take down stormtroopers and the evil dark stormtoopers. Do you have a lightsaber? Nope. But you really don't need to, Dark Forces has you play as a one man army. You're not a Jedi. You're a hired gun, and honestly it's better this way. You're not this over powered superman with force powers, mowing down enemies. You're a dude turned against the empire. You're not in it to be noble, you're out for vengeance. This could have turned into an interesting series, you have this character go deeper and deeper to the darkside basically by killing stormtroopers for the wrong reasons, yet fighting for the right of the rebellion. Instead, they dropped that, gave you a lightsaber, and called you a Jedi Knight in the sequel. Dark Forces is an older game, don't expect to be wowed by the story or gameplay. You might be in for a shock to discover, much like myself that the Theme from Star Wars is played from a Midi version. But that's because its from that odd period of time. No, FMV... that’s for the sequel. If you're a Star Wars fan, you'll want to play this, and probably the rest of the Jedi Knight series.If you're like me, and really didn't know what this game was about. It's a fun doom-like game. If you wait for it to go on sale for about .99 cents. I say give it a shot, I did and got a lot out of it. If Doom/Duke Nukem games really aren't your thing, I'd pass it up.			"

Example there is a night vision goggle in a secret location if you just complete the game ur gonna waste allot of ammo to light up dark areas by firing shots to light up the area. If you like star wars ur gonna love this game its true to the comic book it works sideways with the movie but alternative location.			"

												This game is a blast, I had it long ago for my Playstation and didn't play much because I was actually too young to understand a lot of the missions, since as in Doom and other similar series, it's not really laid out. It's a ""Figure it out as you go along"", first person shooter through many different worlds, trying to learn and halt the Empire's production of the dreaded Dark Trooper Project.Star Wars fans should own this BUT PLEASE READ THIS.Most people have reported issues when starting it. The colors will be very out of whack and make the game utterly unplayable. Sounds also very scratchy. What you need to fix this is in the FAQ page for the game by the Steam Community. Once it's easily fixed, the game is amazingly fun, and enjoyable in many different ways. This game in my book ranks an 8 to 9 for a classic nostalgic first person shooter in the world of Star Wars.

												The game that started it all. If you've ever heard of the Jedi Knight series, this is the first game of that series; the first game where you play as the legendary Kyle Katarn. Gameplay-wise, it's a decent FPS. Think of DOOM but with slightly better graphics and it's Star Wars. The game starts just before 'A New Hope' and follows Kyle during his early mercenary years before he became a Jedi, so no lightsaber combat. The game is pretty much a straight-forward FPS.Other than that, the cutscenes kind of suck but considering this was made for DOS you should let that slide and definitely try this classic, especially if you're a fan of Star Wars and want to know more of the story behind Kyle Katarn.

												Star Wars: Dark Forces was written off as a ""Doom clone"" on release in spite of its critical acclaim,Indeed, it is hard to look at the game and not draw a parallel with the legendary shooter.However, Dark Forces made a lot of innovations on the formula that is common place in shooters of today. Dark Forces innovated with essential features like the ability to crouch, jump as well as to look up and down.This game also made rounds for its ability to feature true room-over-room level designs with rooms intertwining within each other in impressive, multi-story displays of architecture.Dark Forces also shot for a grounded, more realistic look taken right out of the movies in spite of the graphical shortcomings of the era. This was made possible with the game's wide selection of  level tiles that were rarely repeated.Another aspect that helped the unique feel of each level was that no level was simply about traversing from A to B. Instead, you got a detailed mission briefing that gave you multiple goals that had to be seen through before heading out. These goals could be things like turning on the power of an area, planting explosives or infiltrating an imperial stronghold for information before making it back to your ship in one piece. All of these innovations results in a shooter that was way ahead of its time.Dark Forces is a truly unique title that shouldn't be missed by FPS fans and Star Wars fans alike.As a fan of the latter but not the former, I was very happy that I decided to play this game.Be aware that this game comes installed with an outdated version of DOSbox that should be updated and manually configured before play. Luckily, there are users on the steam forums that can guide you through the process if you are unsure of what to do.			"

All of these innovations results in a shooter that was way ahead of its time.Dark Forces is a truly unique title that shouldn't be missed by FPS fans and Star Wars fans alike.As a fan of the latter but not the former, I was very happy that I decided to play this game.Be aware that this game comes installed with an outdated version of DOSbox that should be updated and manually configured before play. Luckily, there are users on the steam forums that can guide you through the process if you are unsure of what to do.			"

												One of the two Star Wars video games (the other being X-Wing) that could capture the mood of the original trilogy for me. It's early enough that it didn't get rendered realistic by the all encompassing EU, it feels heroic and adventurous like the movies themselves. If X-Wing captured the dogfights perfectly, this captured the gunplay of the movies.Of course, many years passed since then, so if this is the first time you meet this game, you probably won't feel like I did. You have to accept that this is a Doom-clone (the term FPS didn't exist back then) with fake 3D, low resolution, low polygon-counts and clunky controls. It's not very accessible if you're not used to old games like this.It also has the problem that the early FPS games following Doom were a bit more detailed which was just enough to make the graphics look less clean. That might be confusing at first.			"

												It is amazing to me how well this game holds up despite its twenty years of age. The story is nice (if you are a Star Wars geek), the gameplay is well-balanced between frustration and fun, the graphics are cool (if you are into retro), the environments and level design are all true to the Star Wars Unverse; all in all it makes for a really pleasant experience. XLEngine is a must, though, or at least the upgrading and tweaking of the included (outdated and poorly optimized) DosBox to make the game playable. I would say it was very much worth my 6 Euros.

Reminiscent of Doom but refined controls and much more story oriented. Great weapons and classic enemies, level design is fun and varied, and mission objectives make progression more interesting than ""find the exit"". Love it!			"

												Although this only shows like less than an hour, I've played this game so much back in the day, and it's amazing. Pretty much, what everyone else is saying about it being a ""Doom/Star Wars"" game is true. They do look very much similar. Although the story doesn't contain too much, the game is still good gameplay-wise. The nostalgia of the game alone sells it for me. The whole atmosphere of the game takes me back to the ""good ol days."" If you played this back then, definitely get it now. It's just as good as it was back then. For any new player, give this game a try. Despite the graphics not holding up too well today, it's still a relic when it comes to the FPS genre and all Star Wars games.10/10			"

												Ancient Proto-FPS. This prequel to the Jedi Knight series is basically like Doom or Wolfenstein, but with Stormtroopers. You play as Kyle Katarrn, before he becomes a Jedi. You basically just infiltrate various Imperial Installations and blast things. The story is all breezy, and involves espionage for the Rebel Alliance, mostly about the Death Star, in advance of the plot of the first Star Wars (the real first one, not Episode 1). That's about it. The game is too terribly long, but not too short either. Basically get it if you enjoy nostalgia, both in Star Wars EU and very early shooters, and it is on-sale cheap, or part of a pack.			"

												This remains, to my mind, the finest Star Wars game ever produced. Having played most of them at one point or another, I feel justified in my opinion.This was one of the early, first generation of 3D games, and I credit it (along with Timothy Zahn) as being the reason Star Wars resurged as it has since 1995. Even today, it is still marvelously fun and fiendishly difficult. Try to get through it at highest difficulty, and enjoy. ALso enjoy the glorious midi-style music and the pixel art cutscenes that are still of a high quality even today. There is nothing to not enjoy about this game - and indeed the rest of the Jedi Knight series. Now if only Rogue One wouldn't retcon its existence....			"

												Star wars Dark Forces was certaintly great for it's time. Pack with a whooping 14 levels with great level designs and albeit hard puzzles (I had to watch a few guides to get me through some levels) it was certainly entertaining. It was the first game on DOS that we are able to look up and down. However, since I'm so used to using the mouse to look up and down, using the keyboard to do that prove a bit tedious. Luckily this game has auto aim, so it helped tremendously. Story wise, It's not so much and not very emphasised. You play as Kyle Katarn, working for the rebelion. You stole the plans for the death star with ease, and later your entire mission will be to slow down the production of the dark troopers. Currently, this story is no longer canon but before episode 7 came out, this is a great bridge to close the loophole of the destruction of the death star. Overall, I do reccomend to give this game a try if you're really patient.			"

Recommendation level:|-|░░░░░░|░░░░░░|░░░░░░|░░░░░░|▓▓▓▓▓▓|+|I grew up playing the best shooters from the 90s like the Doom, Quake, Wolfenstein, Duke Nukem, Blood and Redneck Rampage games, but I only recently had the chance to try out this gem. 20 years after it was originally released Dark Forces is still one of the best shooters ever made, and definitely one of the finest Star Wars game out there.Its graphics are the usual retro pixelated stuff with sprite objects and simplistic 3d environment. Though, it is not as shiny as nowadays action pieces, still the style and detail it presents is immersive and nice to look at. The story is good enough for a shooter, telling various information before every mission and showing cutscenes which are similar those seen in old LucasArts adventure titles, so the quality standard is high. The gameplay is fast-paced and refined making progression through the levels fun. There is a set of well-designed maps which are filled with shortcuts and secret areas allowing and rewarding exploration and adding replay value. The whole game feels good to play with all its mechanics, and never feels clunky as most older games do.Overall, everyone who are interested in retro shooters should try DF along with Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy. There is no way that these games could disappoint anyone.MY OPINION: 8.5/10 (EXCELLENT)Graphics: 8/10World Design: 9/10Gameplay: 9/10Sound: 8/10Replay Value: 8/10			"

												I used to love this game years ago and was glad to pick up the Star Wars pack on sale.  I am pleased it was not all just nostalgia.  This is still a fun FPS, albeit simple in the post Half-Life gamescape.  Many levels are a bit of a maze, but the story, action, and weapons are all enjoyable.  Graphics are better than  Doom 2, but still in a pre 3d rendered era.  While Kyle Katarn and his story of stealing Death Star Plans and destroying the dark troopers is no longer canon, this is a fun adventure in the Star Wars universe.			"

												Though full of ""GUIDE DANGIT"" moments, I really like Dark Forces.  I think the best way to enjoy the game is wander around the level until you give up trying to find the objectives and look up a guide, then only read as far as you've gotten to figure out what you missed. For example, there's a mission where you have to visit 3 areas and then backtrack through to the second one again to find a new path.  I completely missed that because I thought I had explored that area completely.			"

												This is a Doom Clone set in the Star Wars universe.Pros:It has all of the good traits that Doom Clones have, such as no cover, more than two weapon slots,  and non-linear maps.The gunplay feels solid and gunning down enemies is satisfying.The story is pretty good for a FPS released only a year and a few months after Doom II. It involves really good voice acting for the time period and some cut scenes that I imagine looked pretty good in 1995 but now have a certain retro charm to them.The soundtrack really makes the most of it's MIDI music, and most of the songs still hold up today, especially the opening song. Unless you don't like MIDI music, in which case you probably won't like this game's music.The environment is well designed, and does a good job capturing the feel of wherever the level is supposed to be set. This is an area  that I always thought that Doom I and II frequently fell short, so this is rather big deal.ConsThis is a FPS with LIMITED LIVES. You get three in the beginning, and you can find more hidden in the levels. This ""feature"" is definitely going to make a few people not interested in this game anymore, but it isn't as big of a deal as it sounds.You can't save your game mid-level. Even Wolfenstein 3D had that feature, and it also had limited lives, so I can't see why they didn't put that in this game. As with many early Doom Clones/FPSs, to aim up and down, you have to press Page Up and Page Down.  However when you aim at an enemy on a higher level than you are aiming, the game automatically detects that you are aiming at the enemy and your blaster shots automatically aim up. Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't. However, this isn't that big of a deal in the end. Fortunately, the game supports mouse control for looking left and right.Like other Doom Clones, the game is rather pixelated. However, you can use XL Engine (a source port of this game and several others) to fix this, as well as the aiming up/down issue.Easily the biggest problem present in  this game, as well as many other Doom Clones, is that the non-linear levels act as a double-edged sword. On one hand, it can be quite liberating to play a fairly non-linear FPS, as you aren't being pushed down a corridor like in Call of Duty. On the other hand, it can be difficult at times to figure out where you are supposed to go next. This can result in a frustrating ""Where do I go now?"" feeling  compounded by the fact that you usually aren't doing a lot of shooting while looking where to go next. Bottom LineIf you are searching for a retro FPS to wash the foul taste of today's ultra-linear FPSs, this is a game for you.If you like Star Wars, I can't  recommend this game to you unless you also like retro first-person-shooters. Honestly, this type of game is rather dated in some ways, so it isn't for everybody. But if you do like Star Wars and retro first-person shooters, you should buy this right now.Similar games:Wolfenstein 3DSpear of DestinyDoomDoom IIHereticHexenDuke Nukem 3DRise of the TriadBlake StoneRedneck RampageBloodTIP: Press F5 to turn on a flashlight.

												I enjoyed playing Dark forces. A game similar to the Doom/Quake style of gaming filled with Storm Troopers and everything you love about Star Wars makes for a very nice combo. The variation in guns meant you had a plethora to choose from so you can quickly find your style and choose your stride. The character development left a lot to be desired however and the story was just ok. The mechanics as I said before are very similar to Doom/Quake, but while this may bring nostalgia it kind of didn’t work for this game. Many times I needed to look up and down and when you can’t do it with the mouse there is a bit of a problem. Yes you can look up and down, but it is keyed to button presses. This makes the game slow down a bit as you have to either stop moving or stop looking around. Now this can be fixed easily with Xpadder probably or even a mod, but I just wanted to play my game and at the time didn’t think about it.That being said I felt the gameplay was overall solid and the story was easy to follow. The map was a bit hard to navigate and I did get lost a few times, but if you take your time and slow down, or do what I did and look up a play-through, you can make it through. Also punching giant lizards, sorry I don’t know what they are called bear with me I’m a Star Wars fan, but I don’t act like I have a PhD, was a lot of fun!I give the game a solid 7. It didn’t wow me, but it kept me playing and that deserves a solid score.			"

												Classic and only recommended to those who really want to peer into the past. This game is really good. The worst thing about this game are the controls... yes people they managed to screw up the controls to a game that is over twenty years old. The mouse is a bit too fast and it takes some getting used too. But this game was perfect when it was released. There is some percieveable lag due to the emulation. Plus the graphics are obviously terrible; and they haven't aged well. If you are under the age of lets say fifteen, I'd stay away from this game. You won't be able to appreciate it.			"

												Although this only shows like less than an hour, I've played this game so much back in the day, and it's amazing. Pretty much, what everyone else is saying about it being a ""Doom/Star Wars"" game is true. They do look very much similar. Although the story doesn't contain too much, the game is still good gameplay-wise. The nostalgia of the game alone sells it for me. The whole atmosphere of the game takes me back to the ""good ol days."" If you played this back then, definitely get it now. It's just as good as it was back then. For any new player, give this game a try. Despite the graphics not holding up too well today, it's still a relic when it comes to the FPS genre and all Star Wars games.10/10			"

												Oh man. This was the FIRST PC game I owned as a child. Like, the first that I had that I could call my own, and take with me from my moms to my grandmas and install and play because it was MINE and I could take it wherever I felt like. I played this game over and over and over again as a kid. It's basically Doom meets Star Wars. It's not too hard, not too easy, yet it does have those moments where you're wandering around for an hour not knowing where to go, only to find there was a secret staircase you missed because you didn't look behind you when you were walking through that hallway. Attention to detail plays a huge role in this game. You have to pay attention to your surroundings or you may as well just give up. Like Doom? Like Star Wars? Like DOS games? This is a good game to buy.			"

												This is really the first game that made me feel like I was actually in the universe of Star Wars. Playing this as a kid on my stepdad's DOS PC was absolutely amazing. When I booted this game up, I got that wave of nostalgia.However, it wasn't long before the reality of this game's aging set in. Lightly put, it plays like *ss. I can't believe I beat this when I was like, five.HOWEVER, I still recommend people purchase this game; the reason being that some kind soul created the XLEngine for playing DOS shooters on modern Windows PCs. After modifying the game's files to play on DarkXL, it runs like a dream. Resolutions that don't look like vomit, full mouse aim control, and complete control swapping abilities (without having to go through DosBox's ridiculous menus and settings) really catapult this game into the modern era, to the point where it feels even better than I remember.If you're willing to put in the time to configure the game properly, it'll pay off in spades. This game is definitely a classic worth revisiting.			"

												Star wars Dark Forces was certaintly great for it's time. Pack with a whooping 14 levels with great level designs and albeit hard puzzles (I had to watch a few guides to get me through some levels) it was certainly entertaining. It was the first game on DOS that we are able to look up and down. However, since I'm so used to using the mouse to look up and down, using the keyboard to do that prove a bit tedious. Luckily this game has auto aim, so it helped tremendously. Story wise, It's not so much and not very emphasised. You play as Kyle Katarn, working for the rebelion. You stole the plans for the death star with ease, and later your entire mission will be to slow down the production of the dark troopers. Currently, this story is no longer canon but before episode 7 came out, this is a great bridge to close the loophole of the destruction of the death star. Overall, I do reccomend to give this game a try if you're really patient.			"

Recommendation level:|-|░░░░░░|░░░░░░|░░░░░░|░░░░░░|▓▓▓▓▓▓|+|I grew up playing the best shooters from the 90s like the Doom, Quake, Wolfenstein, Duke Nukem, Blood and Redneck Rampage games, but I only recently had the chance to try out this gem. 20 years after it was originally released Dark Forces is still one of the best shooters ever made, and definitely one of the finest Star Wars game out there.Its graphics are the usual retro pixelated stuff with sprite objects and simplistic 3d environment. Though, it is not as shiny as nowadays action pieces, still the style and detail it presents is immersive and nice to look at. The story is good enough for a shooter, telling various information before every mission and showing cutscenes which are similar those seen in old LucasArts adventure titles, so the quality standard is high. The gameplay is fast-paced and refined making progression through the levels fun. There is a set of well-designed maps which are filled with shortcuts and secret areas allowing and rewarding exploration and adding replay value. The whole game feels good to play with all its mechanics, and never feels clunky as most older games do.Overall, everyone who are interested in retro shooters should try DF along with Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy. There is no way that these games could disappoint anyone.MY OPINION: 8.5/10 (EXCELLENT)Graphics: 8/10World Design: 9/10Gameplay: 9/10Sound: 8/10Replay Value: 8/10			"

												Star Wars - Doom, Doom: Star Wars... no matter how you would call it, Dark Forces is really amazing game.Dark Forces wasn't my first Star Wars game. Played it for first time probably around Star Wars Episode 1 film premiere because it made to want to play everything with ""Star Wars"" in name. The only thing I was wondering when I will got lightsaber and have some cool Jedi fights but at the time, sadly, I was disappointed to see that I won't use one in this game. Many years later, in 2016, I wanted to replay it. To be honest, when it would be my first time playing, I would stop playing it few times. Why? First of all, nowaday gamers will have trouble finding their way to finish missions. Levels in Dark Forces are really complex. I laughted few times because I thought that finding a secret places in this game is much easier than finding actually your way trought mission and IT'S TRUE. Not that I hate it but let's be honest, how many games now have this much twisted level construction? Noone to very low... anyway, I love every each of levels. Those are filled with Star Wars - ever wanted to take a trip around Jabba's ship? No problem, there is mission like that! The next thing which really builds well this game are weapons - even tho there aren't any lightsabers, first weapons like blaster pistol or laser rifle are fun to use. Still, in my opinion, nothing beats Stouker Concussion Rifle - once you will get it you won't use any other weapon but be careful: it's powerful enough not only to kill enemies but poor Kyle Katarn too. Who is Kyle Katarn? Our main hero, former Imperial Stormtrooper, working as mercenary. Is he someone important? Well, because of his action there was some kind of event leading to ""moon"" destruction but for more you will need to play game by yourself.The graphics, music, controlls and everything feels really outdated but that doesn't mean it's bad. Years ago it was wonderful. Even the cutscenes looked amazing! As someone who loves to play old games it's still looks great but that won't be a case for everyone. I think everything gathered together builds a great Star Wars game. Sure, maybe you can't save game anytime you want like in Doom but levels aren't so long that you won't complete it at one sitting - there are some extras that will make your game a little more safe, so you won't need to start level at new when you will die. Three difficulty levels will also help you a bit to make your game fit to your taste but keep in mind, that even playing on easy won't be that easy.There is one more thing because of Star Wars being in Disney hands. ""Is this canon? It's not canon anymore, right?"" - does all of this talk really matter? Kyle Katarn is interesting character and it's fun to follow his story be it in games, books or comics. Dark Forces game is also fun to play, it will surely please every Star Wars fans, Doom-based games fans or everyone who just love old games. It's all that matters. I had fun playing Dark Forces and I'm sure there will be another chance to enjoy it over again.			"

												This is a Doom Clone set in the Star Wars universe.Pros:It has all of the good traits that Doom Clones have, such as no cover, more than two weapon slots,  and non-linear maps.The gunplay feels solid and gunning down enemies is satisfying.The story is pretty good for a FPS released only a year and a few months after Doom II. It involves really good voice acting for the time period and some cut scenes that I imagine looked pretty good in 1995 but now have a certain retro charm to them.The soundtrack really makes the most of it's MIDI music, and most of the songs still hold up today, especially the opening song. Unless you don't like MIDI music, in which case you probably won't like this game's music.The environment is well designed, and does a good job capturing the feel of wherever the level is supposed to be set. This is an area  that I always thought that Doom I and II frequently fell short, so this is rather big deal.ConsThis is a FPS with LIMITED LIVES. You get three in the beginning, and you can find more hidden in the levels. This ""feature"" is definitely going to make a few people not interested in this game anymore, but it isn't as big of a deal as it sounds.You can't save your game mid-level. Even Wolfenstein 3D had that feature, and it also had limited lives, so I can't see why they didn't put that in this game. As with many early Doom Clones/FPSs, to aim up and down, you have to press Page Up and Page Down.  However when you aim at an enemy on a higher level than you are aiming, the game automatically detects that you are aiming at the enemy and your blaster shots automatically aim up. Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't. However, this isn't that big of a deal in the end. Fortunately, the game supports mouse control for looking left and right.Like other Doom Clones, the game is rather pixelated. However, you can use XL Engine (a source port of this game and several others) to fix this, as well as the aiming up/down issue.Easily the biggest problem present in  this game, as well as many other Doom Clones, is that the non-linear levels act as a double-edged sword. On one hand, it can be quite liberating to play a fairly non-linear FPS, as you aren't being pushed down a corridor like in Call of Duty. On the other hand, it can be difficult at times to figure out where you are supposed to go next. This can result in a frustrating ""Where do I go now?"" feeling  compounded by the fact that you usually aren't doing a lot of shooting while looking where to go next. Bottom LineIf you are searching for a retro FPS to wash the foul taste of today's ultra-linear FPSs, this is a game for you.If you like Star Wars, I can't  recommend this game to you unless you also like retro first-person-shooters. Honestly, this type of game is rather dated in some ways, so it isn't for everybody. But if you do like Star Wars and retro first-person shooters, you should buy this right now.Similar games:Wolfenstein 3DSpear of DestinyDoomDoom IIHereticHexenDuke Nukem 3DRise of the TriadBlake StoneRedneck RampageBloodTIP: Press F5 to turn on a flashlight. This seriously helps in some of the darker levels.			"

												Star Wars - Dark Forces is a First Person Shooter published by LucasArts in 1995 originally for MS-DOS and Apple Macintosh Computers. I originally got it when the Star Wars game bundle was on a massive sale on Steam. Out of the 10 games I purchased, I decided to try this one out first. Here are my first impressions of it.Graphics - 9/10: The graphics in this game are very reminiscient of Doom and Wolfenstein, both being pioneers for the FPS genre created by ID Software. It is in a pseudo-3D first-person view with pixelated textures. I give it a high score for being very revolutionary for its time, however, that doesn't mean it is perfect. The main problem is clarity. In both Doom and Wolfenstein, the graphics were clear, and you could see all of the walls, text and enemies just fine. In this game, I find that a lot of the time it is hard to see the walls and openings. This game managed to bring out the most that DOS could supply, so I give it a high score.Story - 9/10: From what I've gathered, the story of this gameis pretty much capturing data from the Death Star and bringing it back safely while fighting off Storm Troopers. This is exactly what you would expect from a Star Wars game, although I do take off a point for not much depth. The story is not particularly what you would care about, but it delivers exactly what you want for a Star Wars game.Gameplay & Controls - 5/10: As you can see from my score, the gameplay does have some serious issues. First though, let me get out all of the positives out of the way. The gameplay does give you a good sense of exploration and does a solid of job when it comes to shooting. As for the controls, they do seem standard for the average FPS and can be adjustable easily. Now let's get to the negatives. A serious issue I had with the game play is that whenever you enter a room, you are completely vulnerable to enemy attack without being able to see where they are. There have been numerous times when I go up into an elevator, then as soon as I reach the top, I have to turn around to exit while my health bar is being drained by an enemy that I cannot shoot. The game also is very unexplanatory, as I could not easily figure out all of the controls without some explanation. The controls, when you figure them out however, can be a bit weird to use if you have been previously playing a 3D FPS. You're locked into a left-right point of view, so you can not look upwards or downwards. There are flaws with the gameplay and controls, but they aren't terrible. That's why they get a medium rating.Summary: Overall, Star Wars - Dark Forces is not a perfect game, but still a good one. The gameplay could be better, but it is still a solid FPS and one of the better DOS games out there. For a price of only $5.99 without sales, I would consider it a good deal. I'm sure that there are better Star Wars games out there, but this one is still worth playing.Overall Rating: 7.6/10Hey guys! This was my first Steam Review. How do think it was? Please leave feedback, because I might do this again in the future. Thanks, and goodbye!			"

												Muhuhauahahahahaha. The Force is strong with Katarn..... if you mean to shoot every dude in sight. This game does not feature the lightsabre or force powers. Later games do. This game held cheese to its high standard and back in the old days, these cutscenes were the bomb. Now, you have to use dosbox and cannot aim with the mouse on a vertical axis.... unless you use Pg up or Pg down. I quickly googled the hotkeys and stuff to bring up dosbox options for fullscreen off/on, resolution, how to change key bindings, and such because that was not native back in the good old days. Dosbox makes this highly playable and there were no problems on an 8 core Win7 64bit. Thank God for DosBox. The Mysteries of the Sith , I need to play on my laptop because there are issues with multicore and other stuff. That is its own realm of crap. This game was full of missiles and guns and blasting and PUZZLES. Screw Portal, these puzzles were fun......... and you have to pay attention because no one tells you when you're done or not. You have to check it out, do trial and error, look for patterns, and find it youself. I liked this game and would say it was worth getting in the $5 bundle when it was on  Steam Sale.			"

												A Long Time Ago in a little house in Florida far-far-away...A five year old Star Wars Fan finally got a taste of what it felt like to blast Stormtroopers and fight the Empire in a game very reminiscent of classic FPS games such as Wolfenstein 3D and Doom. Little did this boy know that this would be the beginning of a long and happy infatuation with Star Wars Games.Dark Forces might be old and it probably won't go over as well to gamers used to the HD Graphics of games such as Call of Duty or Halo but for nostalgia or introducing younger gamers with simpler and easy to play classics, Dark Forces is a definate classic for everyone to enjoy.Now you might be wondering how an old game that ran originally on DOS works on a modern computer. The good news is that the game comes built into an emulator called DOSBox which is designed to allow modern machines to run old timey classics such as Dark Forces. It works perfectly and I've not experianced any hickups. The only problems you'll run into is in the gameplay itself as some of the controls are not as modern. The controls are automatically bound to the WASD layout. The biggest problem is that if you need to look up or down, you have to hit the page up/page down keys on the the keyboard but that's the worst of your problems. Most of the blasters autoaim to some degree so you don't have to worry about being presicely on target.So big thanks to Steam and LucasArts for bringing us this Nostalgia trip. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got more of those Imperial Bucket Heads to blast.May the Force be with You.			"

As someone who loves older games, I love seeing the evolution of games by mechanics and engines and so on. For example, there is no vertical aiming system the player controls, but inplace, there is an automatic vertical aiming that happens when you fire so it gives an illusion of it being aimed.

												E' difficile recensire questo titolo, ma proviamoci. Star Wars Dark Forces, pubblicato per MS-DOS nel '95, si propone come un FPS con livelli abbastanza lunghi con segreti e tante armi da raccogliere. Non ha senso parlare di grafica, è un gioco del '95, quindi...tanti nemici da abbattere, ma soprattutto, il doppiaggio in italiano molto buono. Consigliato per amanti della saga, e forse, per i giocatori che si vogliono godere dei titoli nostalgici.VOTO: 7/10			"

												This is a solidly build game.  They incorporated a real story into the game, cut scenes, mission briefings, dialog, something most 90's FPS games just couldn't manage.  And it's done well.  Your charater's a bit overpowered, but it's an FPS, what do you expect?  The level design really shines in a lot of areas, with some fendish puzzles in places.  That may be a negative as some areas of the game will take you a while to figure out how to advance.  There's also not a whole lot of variety in the enemies or weapons, most are just different versions of the same thing.  But what is there is quite fun, graphics are good, story's good, level design is good.  For a 90's FPS, this is almost as good as it gets!			"

												Star wars Dark Forces was certaintly great for it's time. Pack with a whooping 14 levels with great level designs and albeit hard puzzles (I had to watch a few guides to get me through some levels) it was certainly entertaining. It was the first game on DOS that we are able to look up and down. However, since I'm so used to using the mouse to look up and down, using the keyboard to do that prove a bit tedious. Luckily this game has auto aim, so it helped tremendously. Story wise, It's not so much and not very emphasised. You play as Kyle Katarn, working for the rebelion. You stole the plans for the death star with ease, and later your entire mission will be to slow down the production of the dark troopers. Currently, this story is no longer canon but before episode 7 came out, this is a great bridge to close the loophole of the destruction of the death star. Overall, I do reccomend to give this game a try if you're really patient.			"

												Ya like Star Wars? Do ya also like Doom? Well how 'bout Doom with Star Wars in it? Sounds good? Ok, have fun.That's basically all there is to the game, and yet it still pulls it off so well. This game follows the adventures of fan-favorite Kyle Katarn, former Imperial Officer turned Rebel mercenary after learning his father was murdered by the Empire and who, in the expanded universe, was the actual person who stole the Death Star plans. That's what the first mission is about, taking place between Episodes III and IV, just before the takeover of the Tantive IV in A New Hope. The subsequent levels deal with a new threat to the Rebel Alliance and the Galaxy: The Dark Trooper Initiative. Kyle is tasked with finding out what it is and putting a stop to it.Along the way you'll find familar and not-so-familiar Star Wars weapons, like blaster rifles, thermal detonators, and a big♥♥♥♥♥Dark Trooper weapon that is suposedly too heavy for a human to lift, but, oh well, I guess you can lift it after all.The sound and graphics are really good for a 1995 DOS game, and the graphics shine in the cutscenes and look pretty fluid. In game it might be a little harder to see enemies from a distance as they dissolve into a mess of pixels, but the game still distinctively looks and sounds like a Star Wars game, as you will hear the familiar sounds of blasers being fired and hear the cries of dying Stormtroopers and Imperial Officers.In terms of difficulty, this game can be played on easy with a challenge. Not in the form of combat, but in knowing where the hell you're supposed to be going. And the enemies aren't pushovers like in the movies. Stormtroopers will regularly hit you before you can hit them, but there's so much freaking health and shield supplies lying around that the threat of death is rare, and you can pick up extra lives in common enough spaces, so getting a Game Over is pretty rare (and disappointing, because you must suck at this game to get a Game Over.)Overall, Star Wars Dark Forces is a pretty cool game, but I can't see myself playing this very often. It's not a bad game, far from it, but I can't see myself choosing to play this over Doom very often. I'd still recommend picking this game up though, you won't have a bad time, I swear on my life or may God strike me down.			"

												A Pretty good 90s shooter and Star Wars game. If you've played Doom, Duke 3D, Shadow Warrior, ect, you'll feel right at home. Its core gameplay is pretty standard shooter fare, you're a walking armory and you shoot a bunch of stuff until it all dies or gets destroyed. The shooting itself is great fun, giving you access to a bunch of recognizable Star Wars arsenal, along with some weapons whipped up for this game specifically. This game does change the shooter formula up somewhat though by introducing more objective based missions and having a pretty decent overarching story. The levels are also much more maze-like and have a good number of puzzles compared to most classic shooters. You also can't save during individual levels, but the game has a lives system to kind of compensate for the difficulty of finishing a whole level in one go.Unfortunately, because its a DOS era game on Steam it needs some tweaking to get working properly. It does ""work"" out of the box so to speak, however it looks worse than it should and runs terrible on top of it. Luckily, there are several guides that are easy to follow on the steam forums that should fix most of the issues it has. I'd also recommend disabling the steam overlay for it, as it sometimes causes graphic issues. If you are willing to put in the extra work though, it's a great game. Highly recommended for fans of shooters and Star Wars.			"

												Typically people are turned off at the idea of playing old DOS games, but I wasnt. I tried it, and I loved it. As someone who loves older games, I love seeing the evolution of games by mechanics and engines and so on. For example, there is no vertical aiming system the player controls, but inplace, there is an automatic vertical aiming that happens when you fire so it gives an illusion of it being aimed. Plainly, I really like this game.			"

												The story of Kyle Katarn begins here in the first triligy of the dark forces series. Before he was a jedi Battle master for the new jedi order Commander Katarn was a mercenery for the Rebel Allaince and is tasked with the destruction of  the Dark Trooper project (In short he's pretty much a badass, but if you've ever played the Jedi knight series the entire game of dark forces is a cakewalk compared to what he'll be doing afterward)Pros: Fun shooter for it's time it came out in 1995, The sound effects are really good for it's time as well, unlike the original Doom you can look up and down you can even jump, you also have a verity of weapons, the music and cinematices are awesome for it's time after all Scott Larwence is a great Darth Vader.Cons: Some missions have puzzles that are too challenging you will get lost if you don't know what you are doing you'll even die, The game could also be a bit short it took me 9 hours to beat but that's because I've played this before there even was steam, but the number one thing about this is the fact that sewer levels are really a nightmare and there will be more of them throughout the game.

												Kyle Katarn and I stole the plans to the Death Star twenty years before Jyn Orso got there.Like so many things associated with Star Wars, it's hard for me to not to have a view of Dark Forces that is not tinted with nostalgia but the recent release of Rogue One inspired me to revisit the game to see how well it held up.Outside of Star Wars, the other main point of reference is, of course, Doom.  A 1990s FPS was judged based on what it did well or poorly in comparison to the latest id game, to the extent that the genre was known as Doom-clones rather than first person shooters.Dark Forces was a truly excellent Doom-clone.  Despite not having true 3D levels, the developers were able to hack together a system that gave the levels a verticality that Doom just didn't have.  Rooms could be located on top of one another, and the result was anything from maze-like prison complexes built into cliffsides to simple things like gaps you could jump over and bridges you could walk both over and under.  It was the kind of leap forward that sounds so trivial after it was done, it's hard to imagine games without it.  The improved technology would not have mattered if Dark Forces didn't feel like a Star Wars game though.  iMuse was a system that dynamically mixed the music with the rise and fall of in-game action that had been used successfully in previous LucasArts games.  As with X-Wing and TIE Fighter it sounded fantastic when applied to Star Wars themes.  Voice acting and a handful of cutscenes let the game tell a simple but functional story, itself a somewhat innovative idea for a mid-90s FPS.Is it worth playing outside of nostalgia or as a history lesson in FPS design?   Many of the mechanics are simple by today's standards.  Enemies shoot at you or walk around slightly aimlessly, and while there is a good range of weapons available to the player, the gunplay is very basic.  Lives are used instead of a save or checkpoint system, which leads to an occasional need to restart the level when you fall to your death too many times or die against the handful of actually difficult enemies.  Ultimately though it's impressive that the game has aged as well as it has, and with the use of a graphics mod like DarkXL, it's still eminently playable.			"

Some interesting environments (a variety of outdoor and indoor locations, great music (including dynamic music that changes to the situation - unlike many other shooters of its time) and pretty fun gameplay with interesting puzzles. Although a few puzzles can be a little tricky (seems to be a Lucas Arts thing at times), they're satisfying to work and complete nevertheless. Worth a playthrough; while it doesn't include any ""Jedi Knight' elements, it's still a decent enough game nevertheless. "

												If you're wondering what is the earliest and expansive Star Wars game that has depth and based on orginial stories and locations, then look no further than Dark Forces. This series introduced a lot in Star Wars Expansive Universe and it used The Death Star plans heist before Rouge One.What will you like:+ It follows the gameplay standards which were set by the original DOOM. If you loved DOOM, you will enjoy Dark Forces.+ Awesome original soundtrack that is inspired by Star Wars trilogy. It also dynamically changes when going in and out of action (LucasArts iMuse engine)+ Complex level designs with lots of verticality involved.+ You are able to crouch, jump, sprint, use a flashlight, and using alt-fire for each weapon.+ Interesting set of Star Wars weapons (no light saber though).+ Animated Cutscenes.+ Variety of level environment designs. There are icy planets, red planets, sewer level, imperial bases, imperial space station, mountains and so on...What you might dislike:- This version has low res graphics and music quality. I recall that the PS1 version was sharper and had better music.- No free mouse look. You have to press page-up or page-down to see up and down, which you will do when you need to check for edges of a platform before jumping.Who should buy this game?If you like classic FPS games like Doom or Duke Nukem and you are into Star Wars, you will definitly like this game.

												It's a great game. If you like Star Wars and Doom you'll like this. There's lots of variety in the level missions, and the weapons feel satisfying to shoot. My biggest complaint though is that you can't look up or down with the mouse, but the game requires you to do it pretty often. You'll probably want to rebind the look up/down buttons in dosbox to something closer to the walk keys.Other than that I think it's aged surprisingly well. Definitely worth playing			"

												Aaahhhh Good old Dark Forces. I remember watching my father play this game as a kid. He was the master of this game, as he spent countless hours trying to compelete each level with 100% of the secrets found on the hardest difficulty. Decided to purchase the game, and I wasn't disappointed. Despite being 20 years old, the game is a lot of fun, and is pretty difficult to beat on Hard. For $5.99, its worth every penny. I had a lot of fun revisiting this classic. If you're a Starwars fan (New or Old), I strongly recommend giving Dark Forces a try. Its inexpensive, and a lot of fun.			"

It also dynamically changes when going in and out of action (LucasArts iMuse engine)+ Complex level designs with lots of verticality involved.+ You are able to crouch, jump, sprint, use a flashlight, and using alt-fire for each weapon.+ Interesting set of Star Wars weapons (no light saber though).+ Animated Cutscenes.+ Variety of level environment designs. There are icy planets, red planets, sewer level, imperial bases, imperial space station, mountains and so on...What you might dislike:- This version has low res graphics and music quality. I recall that the PS1 version was sharper and had better music.- No free mouse look. You have to press page-up or page-down to see up and down, which you will do when you need to check for edges of a platform before jumping.Who should buy this game?If you like classic FPS games like Doom or Duke Nukem and you are into Star Wars, you will definitly like this game.

												Dark Forces is often compared to Doom, but it's definitely got its own vibe going on. While Doom is run and gun action, Dark Forces throws some map-based puzzles your way. Some of these work really well and are genuinely interesting while others are exceptionally tedious and annoying. The detention center level in particular features a veryfrustrating situation that forced me to spend a few bucks calling the LucasArts hint line in the mid-90s.With that caveat in mind, this is a fairly immersive experience in the Star Wars universe (as immersive as things got in 1995). You get to explore a star destroyer, imperial bases, and even Coruscant pre-Phantom Menace. Upon release, this game offered a lot of experiences that were a Star Wars fan's wet dream - all through the eyes of bad♥♥♥♥♥mercenary Kyle Katarn.I do feel like this game has aged better than its sequel Jedi Knight (1997) in terms of playability. Something about the sprite-based enemies and pseudo 3D experience offers a kind of retro charm that makes this easy to pick up and play.If you enjoy the Star Wars universe and 90s first-person shooters, I would say this is worth the cost of entry. It is a 22 year old game though, so the sometimes-floaty controls and overall aesthetic will likely be off-putting to the folks who didn't play this back in the day.			"
