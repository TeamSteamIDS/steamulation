												Hard Reset is like some strange and wondrous artifact from an alternate universe, one where technology continued to advance after the 90's, but none of the corridor shooter tropes we see in games nowadays ever caught on.  It combines oldschool FPS gameplay from the Unreal era with shiny modern visuals, then adds a light sprinkling of modern shooter mechanics (a regenerating shield meter, two basic weapons that can be upgraded into several very different forms) that enhance the core gameplay without overwhelming it.  Graphic novel-style cutscenes between levels tell a serviceable cyberpunk tale that provides context for all the shooting, but once the action starts, the story elements have the good grace to step aside and let you get down to business.  The levels are open and reward exploration, with secrets to find and explosive items scattered about that let you set up environmental kills - another nod to oldschool design.If you have even the slightest interest in oldschool FPS's, you owe it to yourself to check out Hard Reset.

												I kind of hate this game.  Playing it well requires constantly harnessing the diversity of your arsenal, and I am just not good at fighting with more than one gun at a time.  It is often difficult for me to assess a situation rapidly enough in the middle of battle—while my brain is consumed with the effort of dodging, shooting, and navigating to health and ammo pickups just in the nick of time—to see an opportunity for a better tactic represented by one of my other weapons.So it has been an extremely frustrating experience, particularly because I stubbornly insist on sticking with Hard difficulty to the end (just regular Hard, mind you; there is worse available, if you wish for it).  I can only play one level per session because it's such an exhausting ordeal, and I've spent the entire latter half of the game wishing it would end already.Yet, objectively, I recognize that Hard Reset is a very good first-person shooter of the old school style.  There are moments when I actually manage to adapt and perform well, and it is quite gratifying.  I certainly do recommend it.  Just be honest with yourself about who you really are before you make that purchase.			"

If you have painkillers and are serious as Sam was, then you will like Hard Reset. So basically you are fightning with machines. There are two kind of weapons: assault rifle and energy gun - it seems small but both have 5 configurations so assault rifle can transform into combat shotgun, grenade launcher, proximity mine and rpg. Energy weapon have plasma rifle, shock blaster, railgun, homing projectiles and electric mortar with slowing field. In addition most weapons have alternate fire mode. Hard Reset is challenging, foes are quick and deadly even the smallest one which will swarm player with maximum ferocity like ants. The bigger ones like charger will rush towards you and knock out every obstacles with ease. But still there are much tougher guys... they fire homing missiles with enormous splash damage that hits player even when under cover. Nice music and awesome explosion effects included. Recommend stamp. "

												If you're reading this, you already amaze me. This game is (or was, as of redux) ludicrously obscure.Simply put, Hard Reset is Bulletstorm done right. Made by 35 people on a budget of less than 5 million bucks, you can see the personality in this game.The gameplay is a solid case of using the environment to your advantage, and the soundtrack is some of the best cyberpunk-esque you're going to hear in a long, long time.The graphics put a very large number of triple a games to shame, and all in all the gameplay, sound design and aesthetic come together to make grenading a large group of enemies very, very, very satisfying.My one and only complaint, as you tend to have with budget titles, is that the story was visibly handled after the rest of the game, being told almost entirely through a comic book style series of cutscenes with voice acting (that sometimes doesn't even match up with the guy voicing the character in gameplay) that doesn't exactly go out of its way to win any awards.Aside from all this, the developers get major kudos for releasing extension DLC a good 8 months after the game's release completely free.Hard Reset is a beautiful snack for folks who love retro shooters the likes of Doom, Serious Sam and Duke Nukem, but anyone else should steer clear, as this thing is a hell of an obscure niche title.Edit: If you're asking whether this or Redux is better, the answer is that Redux nerfed difficulty a fair bit and added a sword weapon straight out of Shadow Warrior.That's it.

												I picked this up for cheap and put it on the ""do play"" pile. After it finaly got to my notice I went through it and was plesently surprised. This game might not be perfect but in some respect it gives plenty of good shooting without most of the modern flaws that plague FPS genre.Let me get the downsides off first. The game is extremely linear. This is pretty much a coridor shooter with few hidden nooks and crannies that serve as game's secrets. There is very little variety in what you do, you go from one area, flip a switch fight enemies and move on. This in itself isn't a bad thing as long as the shooting is good, which it is. Another issue  (which does have a fix) is the checkpoint system. You can't manualy save, for the most part it works fine but on harder difficulties there are sequences of encounters where there are no checkpoints in between and each encounter requires near flawless execution to proceed. It can be frustrating repeating the same bit over and over, just to die by one small enemy that sneaked past you. Thankfully via console you can bind a key to set your own checkpoint whenever you like. It works but beware, I wouldn't set checkpoints mid fight, do it only between encounters or you might end up corrupting your save file. With this little tweak the game becomes substantially better, because the biggest source of frustration is removed.*Press ctrl+~ to bring up the console*-Type: bind *whatever key you want* save //this will make that key set a checkpoint at that moment-Type: bind *whatever key you want* load//this button will become quick load button to your checkpointDifficulty in this game is done right surprisingly. Game's harder difficulties are legitimately hard. They aren't unfair hard, you have plenty of tools at your disposal to deal with anything the game throws at you at any point, but if you are playing the first time and don't know what to upgrade...well you might run into good amount of frustration. Upgrade system is simple and robust. Killing enemies and collecting nano will ""level  up"" Fletcher. Then you can spend points upgrading one of your two guns or your suit. The two guns aren't really two guns. Each gun has 5 modes(you start with only one each), and each mode has 2 different fire modes. In essence you have 10 guns, with half of them using one ammo pool while other half the other.You get to pick which gun you get next, and which upgrades for it via the upgrade system. If playing the game the first time that can be a bit unfair because some upgrades are clearly more beneficial over others without the game giving you any sort of hint of what you need. Every enemy type has simple ways of dispatching it, but the game gives little hint to what you need to use, you have to figure it out yourself. That can be harsh when you never knew you had to upgrade emp blast for the blaster or stasis for the mortar. However once you figure this out, it's a very pleasant skill based shooting experience. Speaking of enemies, beware, even the smallest enemies will rip you to pieces in seconds on harder difficulties. You will die if you let anything get near.Overall this game was a really pleasant expereince, a little bit of take on Painkiller formula but not quite there yet. Still if you like a skill based shooting where you can get plenty of challange, this is the right game to play.			"

												Went in with no expectations and left 8 hours later think... that was a bloody fun game! So, imagine a movie from the 1980s, it's about Humans fighting machines, only the movie isn't Terminator, it's some B-Movie Polish Sci-Fi movie starring a guy that vaguly looks like Michael Biehn. They wanted to hire Michael Biehn to be the actor, but sadly the producer had spent the entire budget on the SFX - that's basically Hard Reset.Forget about trying to make sense of the story, which is pretty off the wall and has liberal use of swear words (like a teenager out of earshot of their parents). For this game isn't about an deep storyline where the plot is a social commentary - no; this game is about one thing... shooting robots. Lots of robots, and causing some really impressive explosions.That's where Hard Reset excels - making things explode. It has some of the best lighting effects I've seen in a computer game, which it uses it effectively throughout the game. I'm not one to really care or comment on lighting in computer games, but for once I'm willing to give it a go. The neon world (insert Blade Runner comparison here) contrasts well with the dark gritty under-streets you start in. Yet that isn't the most impressive part of the lighting, it's the lightning that comes from your gun, or sub-stations that spew out lightning shocks that attack the robots and cause environmental damage. Wonderful stuff. Or the huge fireball explosions that emit from Gas Mains and Pipes. It's all nice stuff.Also, like all good 80's Movies this game plays host to one amazing soundtrack that underscores the entire gameplay experience. Like classic shooters before it the music kicks in when the action ramps out and dies out as the last robot's motorservers slowly whine down as it dies in front of you. It's hard to describe the soundtrack, but it fits like a glove. Basically this is a First Person Shooter. It's not ashamed of being a FPS; it grabs the genre and runs with it, only it doesn't stop after the first down... no it continues. It doesn't attempt to re-invent the wheel at any point in the game, so it might get a little stale towards the end, but for me the fun lasted a good 7 hours. It was just refreshing to play a game that knew what it was and tried to be the best it could be at it's genre.I'm not going to claim it's an 'old school' FPS, as it isn't, but there are some nice nods to previous FPS throughout the game that fans of the genre will pick up on.The biggest compliment I can really give this game is that I expected nothing, and came away wanting to raise awareness of the game and get more people playing it.

												Quality over QuantityTo say that this game is short is an understatement.This game occupies 3056 MB of space. Yeah, go figure.That's why they decided to not waste a DVD on it.THE POSITIVES1. This is a PC exclusive (a rare breed these days) with the fully optimized graphic options. The controls are smooth and responsive. I also found myself being swept over with feeling again and again that I was playing a PC exclusive. It is worth paying money to have that feeling - that's what the consoles are turning us into.2. Your character is not a mute like in most shooters.3. I will say that the new engine delivers. The distant vistas, the textures, the physics, the explosions, the graphics in general are great, DirectX 9.0c and all. The details are meticulous especially up close, you can see the tiniest scratches and dents on the objects.4. True, there is no health regeneration.5. The game runs smoothly, no FPS spikes, the dozen or so near-simultaneous explosions are an eye-candy.6. Upgrades for the 10 weapons as well as the gear is always welcome. However, just like in Witcher 2, as soon as you finish upgrading one ""tech tree"" or one upgradable branch the game ends.7. Finally, this game has style. Even though the streets and the slums are empty except for the rampant robots, the peculiar sci-fi world where humanity has learned to download its consciousness into the computer is pretty cool to ponder about.The minuses:1. No crouching.2. No melee (I doubt it's useful against the machines anyway but quite often they do get close enough to ram you)3. You cannot see your legs and you do not cast a shadow.4. BUT there is SHIELD regeneration - something the previewers failed to mention. So the concept of the old school no-health-regeneration kinda goes out the window.5. No reloading.6. The story is kinda blah.7. The amount of enemy types is very limited.8. The jump is realistic. And I by that I mean it is practically nonexistent. You cannot jump over the rails and some other objects even when it seems like you can to save time.9. The game is extremely short. (4.5 hours)The debatable table:1. Initially, there is little to no tactics involved. Once you are met by a group of enemies you will tend to just retreat/move in circles and shoot them up. Since there is no reload option, there really is no incentive for you to stop shooting or taking time for aiming. You will also quickly utilize the environment for more efficient destruction. Tesla coils from the consoles, the explosions from the barrels, the gas balloons, etc., it's all there.2. The gameplay is a cross of Doom 3, Serious Sam, Pain Killer and perhaps Unreal Tournament. Oh wait, all of those games have the same gameplay, that's right you move fast and you blow things away with the hundreds of rounds of ammo. So do not expect this game to make you ration your ammo or even health for that matter since your shield will regenerate.3. The game is extremely linear [duh, it's a shooter) although there are plenty of secret areas that can be accessed if you blow up one of the adjacent oil barrels. Do not expect these secret areas to hold any secrets pertaining to the game, you will just find extra ammo most of the time.In the end, I found myself being sucked into this game nonetheless somehow. True, it is short, but on the other hand, you do not have to commit too much of your time into beating it.			"

												Hard Reset is one of those old-fashioned shooter games... first person, no cover, no blind shoot, it's circle strafe and lots and lots of weapons. The plot is simple: You're Fletcher, working for ""The Corporation"" holding the perimeter of Bezoar city against incursion of killer robots from the outside. When a breach in Sector 6 happened, you're the closest unit to respond, and you must defeat the robot minions, from small swarmers (size of dogs) to gorillas (they charge you, hard), to shooters and more. There are 4-12 secrets per level for you to discover. Some are quite visible, but you have no idea how to get to (some require strategic demolition of certain walls, just like Doom). The plot has a couple twists and the voice acting... well, falls to the cliche at times. But the cutscnes are rendered in comic book style (albeit with sprite animations) to make for a unique look. Another uniqueness to the game is plethora of environment kill objects, i.e. the proverbial 'exploding barrel', except in this game, they are all over the place. Explosive gas containers, barrels, high voltage fans, trash collectors, heaters on walls, they all explode or zap everything around them for a few seconds when hit. And you get extra points for using enviro-kills rather than your own ordnances. Your guy gets three area of upgrades... body, projectile gun, and energy gun. Each area has 5 items that can be purchased / upgraded, and each item can have up to 2 additional upgrades. You come with plasma (for energy) and rifle (for projectile), as well as simple shields (i.e. you have 1 of each). As you advance, and collect N.A.N.O. the currency, whcih are ""yellow/gold"" in the game, you can eventually spend them at upgrade machines to buy the upgrades. Certain enemies are more vulnerable to certain types of weapons, so you'll need to switch things up a bit. The enemies are helpfully color coded to help you sort out which is which. There are PLENTY of boss battles, but basically, defeat all the minions that rushes you, then when the boss starts glowing red on certain sections, shoot those sections. Those areas don't glow red until you defeat the minions, so you can't concentrate on the boss alone. There are probably several groups of these vulnerable points you need to destroy before you can destroy the boss, while its minions hound you. And there were many many levels. When you die, you are sent back to the nearest autosave / checkpoint, with one death recorded against your accomplishments on this level. There are plenty of achievements, such as time spent, how much of the level's NANO did you gather, how many kills, how many envirokills, damage done, damage received, and so on. There are some jumping puzzles, but nothing too dramatic. There is no crouch, so it's shoot only.  Some secret areas requires extended attempts at jumping and running. All in all, Hard Reset is an old fashioned shooter with a better than decent plot and lots of action, but the call for enviro-kills seem to go against the shooter philosophyit adopted. It however, is a lot of fun to play.			"

												Indie games are often maligned (often incorrectly) by certain people who claim that they are done cheaply, cobbled-together or just somehow ""lesser"" games. Whilst there might be some games you could reasonably say this of, Hard Reset is a shining example of how this statement isn't always true.The graphic fidelity shown here is stunning for such a small developer, and the world created is very believable and detailed. As soon as you jump in, you definitely get a Bladerunner kind of vibe going on, and it serves to create an excellent atmosphere.I personally found the story to be a bit generic and therefore lacking (although I do confess in not exactly being a story person for games), but this doesn't really matter as the game does so well in it's execution. From the very start, the game sets a good pace, along with a fair challenge that never feels cheap or unreasonable. From the very first battle, I found the lovely destructive explosions of the robots expiring along with the smacks and clanks of hitting the machinery incredibly satisfying.The only real downside I had with the game is in it's length - it's a few short hours, and does indeed feel like it's only getting going when it ends.  I understand this may be mended somewhat with the inclusion of the DLC, but I haven't played it myself so can't comment.So, on balance I'd say for it's full price of £9.99, you might be better served by looking elsewhere. However, if it comes up on offer for anything less, then it is a worthy purchase.I think it may end up surprising you!			"

												This game presents itself as ""a tribute to old-school shooters"". Indeed, it has some specifics from earlier times such as non-regenerating health (shields regenerate though), health and ammo pickups, secrets and waves upon waves of enemies. However, developers must have thought that ""old-school=hardcore"" and this game suffers from several major drawbacks.- no quicksave. actually, no save at all. game uses autosave functions whenever it thinks is the best time- story is some mess- bulletsponged enemies. even on normal the weakest enemies require to waste your ammo- practically all enemies use the same tactics - to jump on you or to charge at you and deal melee damage- if you manage to hide, than you will be damaged by homing ranged attacks- if you try to ""head-to-head"" fight, your only way to defend yourself is sidestepping. But guess what? You move VEEERYYY slowly, all enemies are much faster than you- lackluster guns. out of all 10 weapon upgrades, 2 or 3 are capable of dealing at least some sort of damage: RPG. Grenade launcher, Railgun and for the best - Smartgun. You will spam smartgun 99% of the time when you get it.- Lackluster guns make you too much dependable on environmental damage - slow and clunky movement and jumping makes finding some secrets very frustrating. it is unknown whether you can't reach some places because there is an invisible wall or because your jumping sucks. Not to mention jump-stepping, when you wand, you automatically step forward or sideways- ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥eeet boss battles, especially that sucker from the Exile DLC.- all these drawbacks make Hard Reset a really hard game (thus probably the name, it resets you brain)The positive points are:+ Nice graphics and art+ Interesting evolving weapons (similar to Bioshock)+ It is not ""a modern realistic military shooter""In the end, I would recommend this game for those who want a challenging scifi shooter that puts you in a disadvantage all the time. If you just want to kill waves of enemies, play Serious Sam instead.			"

												Hard Reset has problems. Huge, giant, glaring problems. Problems that really drag the game down. And that's a shame, because if Hard Reset didn't have these problems, it might actually be a decent game.Hard Reset bills itself on being an old-school shooter, and in some ways it succeeds. You get to wield a veritable arsenal of different and unique weapons that you can switch to fluidly with a twist of the mouse wheel. The controls are very well optimized, most of the weapons have some weight to them, and the action keeps coming at a constant pace. Worth mentioning is the wonderful synergy between all your weapons. You can launch a gravity grenade at your foes to condense them all in one place, then quickly swap to your rocket launcher and take them all out with one missile. The things that are done well in Hard Reset are done very well. On top of all that, the graphics and environments are gorgeous.Unfortunately, the things that Hard Reset does poorly, it does very poorly. First and foremost is the story. The story is not just terrible, it is utterly incomprehensible. It borders on EYE: Divine Cybermancy levels of lunacy, but without that tongue and cheek feeling of ""we know this doesn't make any damned sense"". It tries to sell its bizarre and nonsensical story straight, and fails utterly. It is told only by cutscenes inbetween levels, and it's very telling that the game gives you the option to automatically skip all of these cutscenes in the options menu during any playthrough. And the ending... ugh. I won't spoil it, but the endings to both the main game and the DLC campaign are terrible. Once the story suddenly starts attempting to make a tiny bit of sense, the game just ends.But on to the gameplay. In Hard Reset, you shoot a lot of robots. That is the gameplay. Sometimes there will be small robots, sometimes there will be large robots, and on three levels there will be a boss. There are, quite literally, only three or four different types of robots: the big ones, the small ones, the flying ones, and some other one that I can't even remember but vaguely recall the existence of, as if from a dream. You will be doing this for several hours. At first it will be incredibly satisfying. Then it will become dull and repetitive. Then the difficulty will spike, and it will become torturous and frustrating.And those difficulty spikes are a doozy. You know those robots that take seventeen rockets to kill? You know how you finally downed one? Well, Howsabout you fight two more? Then two more after that. Then two more after that. Then three more and some assorted tiny robots to throw you off-guard. Then one more, but this one has twice as many hitpoints for some reason. And where is the checkpoint in all this? Why, its about five minutes before you even downed the first robot. And yes, the checkpoints really are that terrible. One of Hard Reset's greatest failures is that, for an old-school shooter, they have completely omitted one of the most useful and revered functions of old-school shooters: the quicksave button. Granted, you wouldn't need to quicksave if the checkpoints were any good, but they're not. They are terrible. I really must reiterate how terrible the checkpoints are.Despite doing some things terribly, Hard Reset isn't a terrible game, it's just by no means a great one. There are so many games that do what Hard Reset tries to do, but better. If you want a satisfying old-school shooter, pick up the Shadow Warrior remake or dig through Steam's backlogs for proper old-school titles. Hard Reset might be worth picking up on sale just to knock around with, but with so many better games out there, I can't recommend you pick up this title at full price.			"

												This game in my opinion is a rethinking of an ""old school"" shooter similar to Serious Sam or especially Painkiller.  If you like either of those games at all, you can stop reading now and just buy and play Hard Reset especially given the price.  Many of the game play elements, points accumulation and level crafting are very similar to those of Pain Killer.  But Hard Reset has a Cyberpunk/AI based theme and evokes the sensibilities of Blade Runner including Industrial/Urban rainy scenes in low light though it is has many scenes that are very bright.  It actually has some truly beautiful though Industrially themed scenes.  It has many secret areas and collectable items.  The character movement is fairly traditional though is not too stictly scripted -- you can fall to your death in many areas.   There is some tricky jumping and climbing involved to access the secret areas (some are as difficult as those in Pain Killer).  There is a weapons/armor crafting system that allows one to buy upgrades for weaponry that suites your style (the shotgun is authoritative, I like it).  While it is not an open world, and has no optional quests, the level design is very complex and involves significant maze running.  You  won't likely be bored by traversing similarly designed levels -- the scenes are all quite different.    The visual quatlity is very good and the game performance is remarkably good and has no real bugs or jarring graphical artifacts.  The AI's are very good and at higher levels will brutalize you.  But this is well suited to an aggressive style of guns-blazing play style that starts in the first 30 seconds of play.  It's a shooter :)The game is very replayable which I think makes up for it's main problem -- it is a bit short and difficult (think of it as a Philip K.♥♥♥♥♥♥short story).  So you might want to try it first on a difficulty level that is a notch down from your typical settings.  You can replay the game at higher level using the weaponry you acquired on a lower level.

												Overly long shooter with satisfying explosions and destruction. The story? There's a story? At least one to care about.. NO! The gun mechanics in this game is confusing and a bit complex for most, but if you play like me you'll stick to a few guns out of the bunch to pull throw. You like shooters, brainless shooters? OK maybe not too brainless, since the game will test you to figure out strategies to outsmart a gang of robots in a very small space, that's when the thinking kick into play. Might be me but i had to think a bit, maybe it was share luck but the fact is i got through. The graphics is pretty good so that's a plus and like i said the kill is satisfying. you feel the explosions and destruction by the hands of your weapons. If you're looking for a straight forward shooter then this is your game, just be prepared to wreck your brain by the chaotic weapon system a bit.			"

												Hard reset is one of the best Sci-fi shooters you will play in your life.+ Very good graphics+ Unique HUD+ Gameplay feels really good+ Every gun feels different in a good way+ Good difficulty scaling (the game is not too easy)+ Optimization feels good, and has various graphical options as well as FOV slider+ Great level design+ Upgradable weapons+ Has survival mode- No online PvP or coop modes or split screen- Loading times feel a bit longFor some unknown reason this game looks better then its expensive remake. Also it seems to be more difficult. Better buy this then remake and save some money.Who should buy this game:Everyone that wants great first person shooter.Who shouldn't buy this game:Obviously who doesn't like to shoot stuff (cause that's pretty much all you do), and who hates sci-fi (weirdos).

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.This is a PC exclusive (a rare breed these days) with the fully optimized graphic options. The controls are smooth and responsive. I also found myself being swept over with feeling again and again that I was playing a PC exclusive. It is worth paying money to have that feeling - that's what the consoles are turning us into The gameplay is a cross of Doom 3, Serious Sam, Pain Killer and perhaps Unreal Tournament. Oh wait, all of those games have the same gameplay, that's right you move fast and you blow things away with the hundreds of rounds of ammo. So do not expect this game to make you ration your ammo or even health for that matter since your shield will regenerateOverall: I found myself being sucked into this game.Even though The game is extremely short. (4.5 hours), this game is worth it.			"

												I find myself writing another review for a game that I am never going to complete. This game is repetitive. The guns just lack impact, the enemies AI is just run straight at you, so you do that thing where you run backwards letting them create a conga line as you shoot. There are parts of the levels where clearly once there was a duck button to access them, there is not one now. The setting might be interesting if the story wasn't presented in the most bland and lack lustre way. The voice actors sound bored, the animatics are not even high quality, they look like they paid someone to story board and then never updated to complete visuals. Review score: extreme meh			"

												Hard Reset is a game that very clearly sets out to evoke the more generic and traditional FPS style of yesteryear with the visuals aesthetic of a more modern game.  It does that pretty well and it's a fun and enjoyable game, but it fails in a few areas that are somewhat glaring, and it does have it's problems.  If you're about to stop reading this review because I'm not going to be 100% positive about this review, well, that's your perrogative, but I'm not saying it's by any means a bad game.  It's a good game, bordering on great, but it has some foilbes that hold it back from true excellence.The aesthetic of the game is probably one of the parts it really does very well, and it extends entirely through the game.  It has a very heavy cyberpunk aesthetic, loading screens are hidden behind very artfully done comic book intermissions, and the visuals of the game are absolutely gorgeous.  It has an actually fairly strong story for a FPS (which .. admittedly isn't saying much), and things thematically are pretty strong and engaging.  However, there's two fairly large problems with this aesthetic and both of them essentially boil down to making things hard to distinguish.  First of all, having robotic enemies in a game level that largely involves a lot of technological set pieces makes it very difficult to distinguish enemies at a glance.  Compare this to something like Painkiller or Serious Sam where the enemies are relatively speaking very easy to distinguish from the scenery.  Also, having electrical particle effects for hit confirmations on enemies when the destructible environment pieces also give off the same or similar particle effects make it difficult to say whether you are hitting an enemy with your shots, or the environment. The two guns in their different modes also are difficult to distinguish what mode they are in just by looking at them.  They do have differences in the modes, but they are subtle and hard to tell at a quick glance.The gunplay is simultaneously a very strong element of the game but also very disappointing.  The fact that the two weapons in their different modes handle so well, with a tangiable feel of weight, satisfying visuals, and good sound assets, only serves to accentuate my disappointment and frustration with them having the two weapon mode system.  I don't feel the system adds anything to the game of value in this case.  In some games with a two weapon system what you have is a large weapon selection and you have to choose the two of them that you feel best work for the tactical situations and enemies that you will be facing.  However, with all the different modes available at all times, I kind of am left in agreement with TotalBiscuit's comment in his first impressions that it seems like they used the two weapon mode so that they didn't have to create a series of different weapon models.  It's unfortunate.  These weapons would have been easier - and truer to the 'old school' FPS, if they were simply seperate weapons.The level design is a fairly strong aspect of the game, with lots of areas to explore and a large amount of secrets to find in each.  I like the feeling in several of the levels that you are actually in coherent areas which actually make sense in canon as well; for example one section being a little shanty-town of trailers where people live.  It evokes memories of the level design of Duke Nukem 3D, which is a comparison I make as highest praise, as that was a high point in FPS level design.  The Levellord was a master of the craft.One thing that bears touching on to is that the overall pacing of the levels and the game in general is executed tremendously well.  There's a feeling of momenteum to the game that keeps things going at a decent clip unless you pause to go rummaging and every time I would think to myself that the enemy variety is thinning out there'd be a new enemy, and every time I started feeling comfortable with the level of difficulty the game would ramp it up again.All in all a very well-crafted game with a good theme let down by a couple of fairly large issues that don't stop it from being a very good game and well worth your time and money.

Posted: December 5, 2016
 Overview  Hard Reset is a sci-fi themed FPS set in desolate, unknown world, possibly our own, where science and technology have advanced to the brink, causing chaos and uncertainty for the human race. You play as Major Fletcher, a security officer of sorts whose tasked at patrolling; the game, however, opens up with major Fletcher at his more preferred location: a dilapidated bar. The silence is broken by the call of work and Major Fletcher is forced to go meander through an area of town to investigate potential goings on. Cue the dead bodies and deadly robots and you’ve got endless waves of crazed, bloodthirsty machines to destroy. Your arsenal of weapons to wage war and protect humanity is limited to two, but you’re in luck because your machine gun and plasma gun morph into a variety of deadly products: shotguns, rocket launchers, lasers, grenades and even EMP blasts to name a few. With guns in hand, you’re off to be the sole protector of the human race – get to it, Major Fletcher.There are some major points in Hard Reset that I really enjoyed and other elements that felt lacking. For those of you who expected a story, you’ll be hard-pressed to find one in Hard Reset. With very linear story progression and an even smaller cast of characters, you’ll find yourself very alone; there is not a single human being in the entirety of the game [DLC included] that you meet aside from telecommunications at key junctures. That is, unless a dead body or two will fill your social expectations. This became one of my major gripes with Hard Reset, but keep in mind I love stories, character development and the like, so for me Hard Reset didn’t deliver those expectations. In a city brimming with life and an opening scene of wanton destruction and death, human contact is the rarest commodity. You feel alone, wandering around, slaying hordes of machines, visiting vast stretches of land, scaling buildings and traversing factories only to find the same thing in every scene: nobody.While social aspects aren’t Hard Reset’s suite, it does paint detailed environments: changing landscapes, satisfying destructible objects and lots of them and a generally pleasant musical score and great background pieces, which help bring life into a mostly lifeless, linear game. What Hard Reset does best isn’t immediately noticeable until you progress further into the story. That talent is shown in the enemies you encounter and the bosses you must conquer, providing some unique fights that I enjoyed. Much to its credit, Hard Reset proclaims that it takes a step back into past shooters, removing many of the aspects that have made them dull and too easy; Hard Reset delivers. The game is hard, really, really hard and that’s just the “normal” difficulty. There’s then even more asinine difficulties for those who are truly masochists at heart. Couple that with little to go by and the learning curve can be unpleasant at times. Hard Reset is devoid of any QTEs [thankfully], but also comes with no real tutorials, instructions, no regenerating health or suggestions on how to defeat any enemy in the game, which, contradictory to how it sounds, is rather pleasant. You’re left to formulate your own plans, devise your own cover [this game has no traditional hard cover mechanics] and decide what tools and weapons will work the most efficiently in dispatching the enemy. The lack of help is something I didn't realize was so prevalent in our games until I was restricted from such features. All in all, this left me dying a lot, but not so much that it became frustrating, as I learned to adapt over time.As I mentioned above, the game is mostly linear, but there are secrets to collect and you’ll want to find them since this is the key feature in upgrading your weaponry and passive perks. Most secrets are easy to find and a little bit of digging will net you most of them without much effort. However, finding them all will take a bit of detective work if you’re up for the challenge and some will take some delicate fingers because they're hidden in ridiculously treacherous locations - I'm looking at you secret on the collapsible bridge.Some of you will enjoy Hard Reset for the immense challenge, the sheer destruction and piles of shredded metal you can leave in your wake, while some will find it dull, uninteresting and lacking in substance. I do admit, the game started to become far more interesting right towards the end, leaving a kind of hollow victory inside me as the credits rolled and I left looking for more, only to find I had done all Hard Reset had to offer. Pros   Challenging gameplay. Satisfying destruction and damage modules on enemies. Cons    Lack of NPC interaction and linear feeling makes the game feel rather empty. Even with the DLC, Hard Reset is a short campaign. The story is vague at best, but never felt worth paying attention to anyway.Overall, Hard Reset targets a rather unique demographic, which is probably why it has received such mixed reviews overall. Providing a grueling, unforgiving FPS experience is great for some, but an anemic story and linear gameplay might be too much to overlook for other buyers, leaving them disappointed. While I personally enjoyed the game for what it was, I highly suggest looking into it before you buy it because Hard Reset isn’t for everyone.			"

												I must start by stating a little spoiler about this game's mechanics that i think is very important to understand as it is so dominating in this game. The mechanic in question is the constant 'jump-scare' type of enemy spawning in the levels. Not once during the main or DLC part of the game does the player initiate combat. It is always the enemy who makes a massed rush against the player in hopes of taking him out. Rinse and repeat from beginning to the end. Only thing that changes is the enviroment and mix of enemies you encounter. Difficulty level is actually pretty constant. Some bosses every now and then force you to think a bit on how to deal with them.  Using enviroment to your advantage is a key component in the game too. The statement that this is a hardcore shooter is pretty accurate. You complete levels, find secrets, grab health and ammo pick-ups, earn nano-bars that can be exchanged for upgrades. You have two weapons at your disposal and those two weapons have large add-on modules that can be purchased. (example:Assault rifle-Shotgun-Grenade Launcher-RPG-Mine Layer are all the same fully kitted out weapon but different firing modes)Early game is the worst part. you dont have any choice for weapons so just surviving and picking up nano-bars and hard to find secrets is what you need to concentrate on. As you start kitting out your weapons the game starts to shine. And once you have completed the game you realize you have 2/3 of the achievements left.  (Go on, try it on 'Insane'). For me this was a very good game.			"

												One of great and unique FPS games, combining old school FPS with modern FPS elements just make it more beautiful.This game offers you:+Good Shooting, you feel every bullet that escapes your gun.+Good weapons, 10 different weapons with unlockable skills for each one.+Good level design, you can imagine how that world look like.+Good AI, they can dodge your shots sometime in really good way.+Good sound effects, physics and explosions.+Its not a horror game, but there are jump scares.+Using the surroundings around you will help against heavy enemies.+Utilizing your weapons will give you better gaming experience.+Great graphics, it doesn't look old even after 3 years.+Good DLC expansion, new levels and enemies.+Good boss fight.- Its hard to avoid getting damage, it seems your hit box is so big, like a fat guy with cool guns, really hard to dodge without running, which require stamina and space to run into. (this game for you hardcore gamer!)Flying Wild hog proved they make really great FPS games, if you finish this and want more, Shadow Warrior.I hope it gets a sequel with better story elements, like shadow warrior style.Don't miss this game, worth the price, it get discounted frequently too.

												I had a lot of fun with this game.  Great graphics, great oldschool (but more Painkiller than Doom style) shooting, somewhat confusing story where it felt like not enough background info was given to know what's going on - but whatever.  And Normal difficulty was actually challenging without being frustrating!And do yourself a favor and use that first upgrade point to get the Shotgun - it rocks! My only minor quibble is that due to the way the weapon system is set up, it often took two key presses to switch to the gun I wanted.			"

I was expecting a great old-style shooter in the vein of Serious Sam and Painkiller, but what I get are a bunch of ineffective weapons to use on a bunch of boring robots that often do way too much damage to increase the difficulty artificially, with a boring story.

												Flying Wild Hog are a developer I've learned to love because of their unrelenting old-school design philosophy. They hand you a variety of interesting and unique weapons, add in a no-nonsense upgrade system, then throw you into a well detailed and absolutely gorgeous world and throw large numbers of fairly challenging enemies at you to overcome until they turn you into a badass. Coming out a year before the equally awesome Shadow Warrior, Hard Reset is an arcadey, clunky first-person romp through a near-future, lightly-cyberpunk city that flew almost completely under the radar.HighlightsMuch like Shadow Warrior, Hard Reset is a game that puts everything together really well, and gives a strong level of immersion that's missing from most games these days. I caught myself feeling like I was a detective inside a Blade Runner movie, trying to figure out what was going on while fighting off hoards of robots and passing through grimy city streets under the classy neon embankments, which, at times, is a real pleasure.* The Flying Wild Hog Engine was built specifically for this title and is absolutely gorgeous while still performing really well* The production value is clearly high, and it feels a lot more solid and well designed than just about any other indie title* Extremely good content updates and freely released DLC which adds to the game deserve special mentionMistakesThe settings and characters for this game give a ton of possibility and are really a blank canvas. It's a shame then, that what could've been an extra special experience ended up being merely an above average game due to a very forgettable plot and story and Comic-book intro scenes and good voice acting help the world come alive, but don't add much to the story or suspense.* Feels like a corridor shooter at times and tends to feel very samey towards the end, despite the wide variety of weapons and upgrades* For an FPS, it has lacklustre boss fights and a forgettable ending purely because of the lack of consequence, again because of the storyRecommendationsPriced at £9.99/13.49€/$14.99 at the time of review and clocking in at 8 hours gameplay, and with all the new content being released for free, Hard Reset is good value. It's also routinely on sale for as little as $4.99 on Steam and $1.49 from various Indie Bundle retailers.* There's a fantastic Developer Artbook with characters, landscapes and plenty of concept art which is definitely worth a look. Available for free from here* There's a free demo available on the Steam Store Page below which gives a good feel for the title			"

												This game was lots of fun.  There isn't much of a story.  And you probably won't want to bother following what story there is...because it's a mess.  But the story doesn't seem to be the point here anyway.  This game seems to be about the intense action.  You run around fighting off hordes of killer robots who try to swarm you, stomp you, and lay into you with buzzsaws.  There are only two basic weapons, a gun and a laser, but they can be modified and upgraded to do a ton of different stuff.  For example, the gun starts off shooting only bullets, but can be upgraded to also fire grenades, rockets, and what not.  Same with the laser -- you can buy upgrades in-game to make it shoot energy rail slugs, EMP blasts, etc.  Plus, there is lots of stuff in the environment you can blow to bits (electrical transformer boxes, gas cans, cars, oil drums) which, of course, can be used against your enemies.  Many of the enemies are tough and it takes a lot to bring them down.  Also, it seems that most of them want to engage you in some type of melee combat, so this is not an FPS for you if you want stealth and sniping.  Most of the combat will be in-your-face, and you'll be running around like crazy, spraying the mobs of enemies with lots of hot lead and laser blasts.  On top of the fast-paced combat, you'll get to enjoy the super-cool cyber-punk setting.  I had fun with this one; hopefully you will too.P.S. It is a bit short -- I finished it in just over 10 hours.			"

												Hard Reset is a fast paced revivalistic shooter, a tribute to a kind of game that has nearly vanished from the gaming world and has been replaced with the ""wanna be realsitic"" shooters.Let me start off by saying the game looks amazing. Graphically impressive with an art style that matches the tone of the game perfectly. Weapon effects, explosions, rain... Everything looks top notch, especially this being the first game of a small company.Gameplay is fast and brutal. You only have acess to 2 weapons, one that uses bullets and the other electricity. ""Just 2 weapons?"" you might think. No, not REALLY 2 weapons, as each weapon can be upgraded and transformed into various other weapons at the same time, so the machine gun you start off with will be able to transform into a shotgun, a rocket luncher or a grenade luncher for example. Oh, and every ""weapon"" has secondary fire, and none of that ""aiming down the sights"" BS here either. Just run fast and hold down either fire button and have fun.There's also secret areas to be found, wich hide ammo, health or the currency you need to upgrade your weapons or health/armour and all that.Unlike most games of this genre, wich focus on humour (like Shadow Warrior or Serious Sam for instance), HR's tone is darker. As i said before, the artstyle matches this and so does the story, even if the plot is only serviceable most of the time.A really great, underrated game that deserves to be enjoyed by anyone. There's even a free DLC!			"

												When I bought this game as part of the christmas sale 2014, I didn't know what to expect, apart from a heavily visual-focused cyberpunk shooter. Trying it out showed me that Hard Reset was exactly that; but unfortunately, I put it down due to hardware changes and eventual loss of interest. In the last two days, I've been finishing up what was left of the game, and thus decided to share my opinions on it.First of all, positive points.+ Hard Reset packs a visual experience so unique and interesting that I have yet to see a match for it in this point.+ The game supports surround sound, widescreen and multiple monitor setups. Not many games from this production value category do.+ The story is intriguing, and had me captured.+ I always love it when games integrate mechanics into the environment, like the upgrade machines in HR.Neutral points, for those interested.#This game bleeds Cyberpunk, (If you don't know what that means: dystopian Sci-Fi. Essentially, Corporations against Humanity.) which was one of the main reasons for me to buy it.#Whilst having the appearance of a linear game, it felt slightly like an RPG to me.And finally, the negative points. Sadly, there are not too few.- The game felt VERY repetitive. Shoot enemies in area A. Go to Area B using Button. Loading. Repeat.- I had to play the game at easy difficulty because of the sheer mass of enemies. There were some parts of the game where just senseless amounts of baddies were cornering and subsequentially destroying me for no apparent reason. (Protip: the shotgun is very effective against the small and medium enemies.)- The storyline of the game was very predictable. (Example: ""Oh how unusual that there is entity XY in this area."" *10 seconds later* welp, time to fight it as a miniboss.)- The endboss was a pathetic excuse. In the last level you're just being flooded with information about the 30 weak points he has, and they're even pointing them out so you can remember them, even though the vulnerable areas are lit up in neon orange on the boss himself.- There are many N.A.N.O. Packets (the ""currency"" with which you pay for upgrades) placed in the environment. Unfortunately, some of their positions seem like they were chosen before the ducking mechanic was removed from the game, which is another negative point.- The storyline, although nice, feels unexplained in some parts. I wonder if it were possible to implement a codex-like mechanic in which the players could read up on the game workd? It would surely help the immersion.- The sprinting. You can't upgrade it. The distorted effect on the screen. You can't steer at all whilst sprinting, and it offers absolutely no benefit whatsoever. The heavier enemies crush you, and the smaller ones block your sprinting.Conclusion: I do recommend Hard Reset despite its' bad sides. It still has some improvement potential.That's it for now. Keep in mind, this review is based on my personal experience of the game. I hope my review helps in improving the game, given the fact that the developers read, let alone care about these reviews.xoxo			"

												For people who actually read reviews and want to try this game. You need to take a deep breath and start this game on insane difficulty. If you are doing the old ""First I am gunna play on normal"" then do not play this game. I started on Insane difficulty and died a lot but the satisfaction of actually being able to completely finish almost every level on insane difficulty when just starting the game is pure euphoria. Everytime you defeat a bunch of these robots, saying the phrase ""Hunk of Junk"" feels all that sweeter (There should have been an acheivement for this. Why they did not even think of making this an achievement is the devs fault). 10/10, I am gonna start EX mode to start my revenge.			"

												This game is a big f-cking metal boot stomping on your face from beginning to end.  I fricking love it.  Everything about this game is solid; from the all-in-one weapons, the diverse enemies, the levels, the gameplay, the story, the audio acting, the comic book panels in-between levels, the chaotic levels, everything.  The only disappointing thing is this game can be very tough and challenging for the first time player.  I died over 50 times on my first playthrough on normal, and over 180 times on my third playthrough, which was on insane difficulty.  I'm on my fifth playthrough, and its only now I'm going through levels on insane difficulty with confidence and capabilities to terminate the enemies before they terminate me.   This game has five difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard, insane, and the almighty heroic), plus a new game+ mode.  It also has an arena mode, which I've yet to try.  The achievements are solid and worth going after, unlike some games with their lame achievements.  There's no trading cards yet, even though the store page says there is, but I'm sure the devs will release those soon.  I can't praise this game enough.  It's solid.  I really hope a sequel is on the developers minds.			"

												Trouble and strafeHARD RESET sets out to provide old-school run and gun fun, and it succeeds admirably. The combat is frenetic (and tough at times) with waves of enemies being punctuated by simple puzzles and a light story line. The graphics are good for an indie game and the environments are impressive and immersive (it’s clearly influenced by Blade Runner, and that’s no bad thing). Physics play an important role: there are plenty of explosive and electrifying objects in the environments to help with the frenzied firefights. The enemies are well-designed and quirky (some even have propellers on their heads) and, although there aren’t that many classes, their attack methods develop as the game progresses to keep things mixed up. Although you only get two weapons both can be upgraded to add lots of additional fire modes (I liked this aspect -- some games have too many weapons). I really enjoyed this game despite the fact that I normally prefer a more nuanced shooter. It’s fast, furious, and a whole lot of fun. 4/5			"

												Hard Reset is an old-school FPS shooter with a heavy dose of cyberpunk. As Major Fletcher in the year 2436, you have to defend Bezoar city - humanity’s last sanctuary from an unrelenting hoard of machines, while uncovering a more sinister plot unrevealing in the background. To do so you have two state of the art rifles at your disposal, one based upon kinetic projectiles and the other based upon futuristic energy tech.There is no cover system and no crouching, this means quick decisive action is the main style of play. By upgrading your weapons with various modules, you can unlock different firing modes; such as shotgun and rockets for the kinetic rifle, or lightning and homing plasma for the energy rifle. There are no handholding tutorials either, so you have to figure out how best to utilise each module against your enemies. Learning to think on your feet is essential.You can draw good comparisons between this and the Painkiller series, with each stage divided in multiple sections, defended by waves of robots; progress is inhibited until every last bit of those cursed bots are put down for good. So if you never liked playing Painkiller, this probably won’t fare much better with you.Bezoar is a vibrant city with many dangers lurking every corner, hovercrafts blanketed the skies as neon billiards flickered under the heavy rain. Every stage is unique and distinct from one another, you can tell a lot of attention was placed in level designs. Which is a shame since the cityscape is mostly devoid of life and you will never see many people during game play, the robot menace are fairly uncreative too and they tend to become bullet sponges later on.The main game consists of 7 levels while the free Exile DLC bought that up to 12. An initial play through lasts around 7-12 hours to complete, while it will take at least 40 hours or more if you aim to complete every achievement. An arena mode exists but it isn’t fully integrated with the Steam leader boards, so I didn’t bother much with it.Lastly, a “re-mastered” version was released called “Redux”. Logic would assume that Redux will be superior, but with arguable improvements on graphics, a gimmicky “cyber katana” that added no value to actual game play, a seriously dumb down level of difficulty for console babies and no additional modes or levels, you are probably better off buying this cheaper version for now.In conclusion Hard Reset is an underappreciated gem that can be a bit rough on the edges, but it is ultimately an enjoyable experience to play and a refreshing take on the old school formula. All FPS enthusiasts should look out for it during sales.			"

												Nice Game, though flawed. For example, the ""secrets"" most of the time aren't secrets at all but rather .... ""oh, theres a staicase that leads both up-and downstairs. I'm supposed to get upstairs. Let's get downstairs... oh, there's a secret."" Also, prepare for some pain dodging enemy fire, since every freakin' ranged weapon in this game seems to have AoE abilities, so dodging/hiding behind cover is nearly impossible - and most enemies are melee anyway. And while the Idea of only having 2 weapons, but both with 5 different mods and each mod having two modes is an interesting thought, in reality it makes things unnecessary complicated. I can still recommend it, as the low-priced game that it is, but if you are willing to pay a bit more to get a better game, get Shadow Warrior (2013) instead. Also by Flying Wild Hog, but superior in every regard. However, I can't deny that, as flawed as Hard Reset is, it is still a nice FPS to kill a few hours with. Especially if you happen to be a fan of cyberpunk-style. So, for the 80% Sale we're having right now: It is a damned steal. Go get it. Despite what I pointed out, it is fun as well - though I can't easily describe WHY. On a percentage scale, I'd give Hard Reset a 7/10.			"

												Hard Reset is cyberpunk themed FPS taking place in the last remaining human city - Bezoar. You are Major Fletcher and you have the job to keep the evil robots out of the city. During your missions you are tasked to find Prof. Percival Novak, who is responsible for the breach, but the truth isn't all black and white. There is much larger threat looming over Bezoar.Game features fast paced, old school shooter gameplay and plenty of enemies that come with it. You have 2 weapons on your disposal but they can each be upgraded to several different weapon types. Your assault riffle can be upgraded to shotgun or RPG while your energy gun can turn into railgun. Enemies are ranging from small bots to big, missile launching robots. Boss fights require different approach and special way to defeat them.Game is relatively short, consisting of 12 levels, that can be completed in 4 hours but higher difficulties will prolong it significantly. Story isn't the positive side of this game. It is told through few cutscenes and even then you'll have a hard time understanding it. What is lacking in story, it is fully repayed in graphics department. Visuals are outstanding and you will be compelled to destroy everything on your way just to see those fancy explosions.			"

												Have you ever experienced a cheap gunfight in a game? Well, just imagine that stretched out to an entire game and you have a pretty clear image of what Hard Reset is.You fight your way through waves of enemies from point a to point b, and occasionally push a button or two. Now, this formula is fine, as long as the shooting is solid. However, in Hard Reset the shooting is far from solid. The combat in this game is dull, irritating, cheap and unenjoyable. There are a few levels of♥♥♥♥♥♥i have to get through to properly describe just how broken the combat of the game is, and that is what this review is gonna focus on, the combat.1: WEAPONSThere are two weapons in the game, one standard bullet and expolsive rifle and one energy rifle. The twist with that though is that these two weapons can become five different weapons each, wich is a cool concept. The problem with this is that there is barely a difference between the different firing modes, especially with the energy rifle. Expect to accidentally blow yourself up, alot. All and all they feel alright to use, nothing special though.2: ENEMIESNow this is where the♥♥♥♥♥♥truly starts to thicken. The enemies and the placement of those enemies is so cheap that you'll want to throw your keyboard out the window. Almost all enemies are extremely damaging, and can take you down in a few seconds. Now combine this with tight arenas, constant flanking without any warning, fast and unpredictable movement, slow player movement and you are set up to have a pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ time. There are a few different enemy types that you'll encounter on your ""journey"", and they all share the same tributes. They are all annoying as sh*t to fight, they dont feel fair, the designs are repetetive and uninspired, the color pallets are bland and boring and you'll have more fun smashing your face with a hammer while masturbating with sandpaper. You have a generic fast little bloke with two legs and some sort of melee weapon, a generic ranged humanoid robot, flying turrets and, you guessed it, a generic ♥♥♥♥ing large robot that runs at you. Those are 90% of the enemies you'll face. Im only going to go in depth about one though, the common large ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.So, you'll face some big robots that just run at you like a ♥♥♥♥ing bull, and there is nothing wrong with those types of enemies. Serious sam had those enemies, and they were great fun to fight! You could dodge them pretty easily if you knew where they were coming from, and it was the player's fault if they died. In Hard Reset, you have barely enough space to dodge these guys! The arenas are filled with tonnes of dead ends wich the robots can easily trap you in. And if you even manage to dodge them, you'll still magically take damage as the w*nker passes you (poor hitboxes). And as an added slap to the face, there are probably billions of little small, fast sh*theads waiting behind you, because some fuc*ing sadistic developer REALLY enjoyed placing enemies in the most annoying, autistic locations. WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ HAPPENED HERE? DID ANYONE ACTUALLY PLAYTEST THESE AREAS?  The combat is just a ♥♥♥♥ing chore, and I really had to force myself to complete this game. 3: LEVEL DESIGNYour level design should compliment your gameplay, wich in Hard Reset it does not. Levels are usually semi large areas with a bunch of clutter and dead ends purely to annoy the player. It's also repetetive as balls, you just shoot some guys, push a button, shoot some more guys repeat. Basically, it ♥♥♥♥in' sucks.Other notes:-The optimization is absolute sh*t-The comicbooks are poorly made, downright laughable at times-The story is a joke, it tries to tell this serious story about ai and robots, but just falls flat on it's face. It makes litterally no sense and you'll find yourself skipping all the cutscenes before long-Really short, however, I consider that kind of a good thing considering the quality of the game-Poor english localization, typos and strange pronounciations are common-The visual effects are everywhere, don't look good and make it hard to seeConclusion: Don't buy it. Flying wild hog improved significantly with their second game, ""Shadow Warrior"", and is a much better game. 4/10			"

												There is a demo, try that and decide for yourself. This is a mixed review, there are many things I love and hate about this game.It's hard on hard.Bullet sponges everywhere.Cool weapons; you only get two, but then you upgrade them to get many different weapons, although they share ammo.Movement is slow and clunky. There is a sprint, but it locks you out of shooting and jumping. Platforming sections though rare and only for secrets are a pain since your character weighs a ton. Can't jump over knee-high walls, no crouching; so there are many places where it looks like you should be able to go and you can't.The setting is super cool, interactable ads, and little kiosks that talk to you and try to sell you♥♥♥♥♥♥as if you were a consumer, I only wish I could actually buy their hair-cream. There are big tv-screens that activate and show the news when you look at them, really neat.The ingame menus for upgrades and pretty much anything are really cool; a holographic screen pops up in front of your character and your crosshair turns into a little hand cursor which you can use to interact. Kinda neat, get the demo to test it out.My game stutters even though I get a constant +100fps on a 144hz monitor, gives me a headache, v-sync on or off, doesn't matter. Because of this I can only play for short periods, and I have less patience with this game than others because it physically hurts. Maybe I should stop playing altogether. The problems are present in the demo aswell, try that and if you have problems there, don't bother with the full version.Fov slider is measured in vertical, prepare to use a calculator.I'm getting frustrated with the bullet sponges, so I'm just going to lower the difficulty. Maybe then I'll like the game. There's a demo so try that, though be aware that the upgrades work differently in the demo than in the full game, they also come slower.I want to like this game, the setting and the awesome guns, though there are some points that just drive me nuts. I would strongly suggest you try the demo, it throws two bullet sponges at you at the same time to give you a feel for what you're going to be dealing with depending on the difficulty.I am not going to give up on this game, I paid for it, and so I want my enjoyment out of it, I just have to figure out if I like my cookies gooey or crunchy (gooey btw)			"

												A decent, challenging cyberpunk FPS. Hard Reset is a great looker, boasting both an amazing artstyle and great graphical fidelity. Nothing bad can also be said about the technical aspect either, since gunplay is solid and the weapon animations smooth. The soundtrack is okay and fits the game, albeit is nothing to write home about.That being said, Hard Reset suffers from repetitiveness, especially in the later stages. Fighting bullet sponge enemies in similar, dark rooms can be fun for only so long. The game follows the Serious Sam formula of locking you in an arena with hordes of enemies, and that inevitably gets boring during long sessions. The game shines when you treat as a time killer you boot up every once and again, not when you marathon it from start to finish.It should also be noted that Hard Reset gets really difficult at times. It is a challenging FPS for the veterans of the genre, not a game for newcomers.While Hard Reset might not be worth the full price of 13,99€, don't hesitate to grab it when it's on at least -50% sale. It has flaws, but it's certainly not a bad game.			"

												This was one cool game in my book. Made by the devs of Painkiller, Bulletstorm and Shadow Warrior.It's an old school type of FPS - think of Serious Sam, but in a Cyberpunk future.The story is presented between levels, simplisticly drawn and in a comicbook style. The story lacks... but this is a ""Robot masacre simulator"", so the story is there just to have something to follow and move forward.Now the great part of this game are the graphics. They nailed all design elements:* a world taken from DeusEx combined with Terminator future* also the DLC has a more junkyard vibe... think of the ""Enslaved: Journey to the west"" game* lots of details in all elements, from world design to enemies* great weaponsThe sound effects are also great, the music is there and is not bad, but the voice acting lacks... luckly there is not much of it. Gameplay ways... had lots of fun. These are the things I want to point out:*the weapons are originaly implemented, but not perfectly*enemies are really cool and engaging, but only 3 types with 3 variations on each*bosses are lots of fun, but again, too few*linear levels, but the secrets are a cool addition, giving you a reason to explore*environment traps are amazing and one of the most fun part of the game* ~8-10 hours of gameplay for the main game+DLCThe DLC has a few more enemies, new setting and is equaly as fun as the main campain - worth it!The Redux version brings 1 more enemy type (zombie like), 1 more weapon (sword) and a dash move, this along the improved graphics, performance and more balance to the game - if you own the original, I would say that this is not worth it, unless you want to support the devs or have extra cash at hand.PS.

												Pretty solid game. There were a lot of complaints about its length, but if you play through the base game and the DLC, you're in for probably 10 or more hours of shooting good times.The weapons are interesting and the difficulty is high enough that I found I needed to use the crowd control mechanics extensively in order to get by.I played the game on Hard, which is the default setting I use when playing shooters, and this one was by far the hardest one I've played in recent memory. There was one boss fight in the original chapters I died 49 times on!One cool thing about the level design is that there are a lot of secrets tucked away in the levels which is something a lot of corridor shooters have lost over the years since the Doom II days. Some of the secrets are pretty easy to find, but some required really studying the options available in the room to figure out how to get to them. I highly recommend advancing to the Rail Gun or the RPG as fast as possible (accomplish this by checking the pre-reqs on it and focusing on them as high priority upgrades). The rest of the weapons do not do enough damage to really chip through the harder enemies fast enough. Again, this was on Hard. Maybe Normal is a cakewalk, I dunno.Overall, good game, probably didn't get the acknowledgement it deserved.One final note - the story is nigh incomprehensible, the VO often cringeworthy, the cutscenes okay, but the Cyberpunk setting is cool and you don't need to understand the story to enjoy blowing up endless waves of robots with a creatively versatile arsenal.

I will update this until I beat the game, which I am doing so on Normal difficultyThe Good Stuff++Achievement Hunters, this is the game for you+Cyberpunk setting mixed with some minor horror elements, not jumpscares but a sense of wanting to get the hell out of places (i.e. Abandoned hospitals) +The diffculties have a huge difference between them, you've been warned+You have your Plasma gun, you Rifle, all of their attachments, and more importantly the environment to kill enemies+No pausing for upgrades, cutscenes or anything of that sort duing missions, everything just keeps moving making the game rather frantic and fast-paced+Interaction with upgrades and in-game computers are done on the spot with no seperate screen, kind of a neat mechanic, you'll see what I mean+Checkpoints in each mission allow you move through the game while feeling like progress is being made, because you may or may not die a lot+Boss fights are a lot of fun, they are my favorite part of the game and kind of save this game from getting a thumbs down for me as they are difficult, but not insanely hardThe Ok Stuff=Mindless FPS, as in it is solely a shooter game with no other elements besides moving from area to area shooting enemies. Don't expect anything else from this game=Jumping is rather wonky, and there are just a few spots that require parkour=Shoot red barrels to make them explode... wow... who knew the barrels being red meant they were explosive.. that's like saying just because that hot girl is a cheerleader she must be a ♥♥♥♥♥. =Even though I said the boss fights are my favorite part, there are a cluster♥♥♥♥ of enemies that spawn with the boss hence the difficulty of themThe Bad Stuff--As you probably guessed, this game gets repetitive... fast.-Few types of enemies, easy to figure out-The voice acting is not great, but you can still get by it-Hints in the game pop up frequently and they are kinda useless and they just try to hold your hand while playing. It's like your mom when you had to go to the grocery store as a child, however mother was never useless-Story is bland and unoriginal, still worthwhile though. To save time you could just skip the cutscenes in between missions, as this could easily be a game you play while listening to music, Podcasts, YouTube, etc. The Truthful Hard FactsAcquirement MethodSteam StorePrice Paid$1.49 (The exact amount escapes me)Length6+ hours depending on difficultyTypes of DLCExpansion Pack [FREE]The Elaborate and Perplexing Scoring System10.

												Please excuse the lack of 100% achievements. I thought I could handle an FPS, but then I took insane for a spin. Hard Reset is like an unrelenting Olympic gymnastic coach who never gives you a moment's break. Are you sure you are out of the blast radius? Нет . You miscalculated your shield recharge time? Nein. You thought a few heavy headshots would kill a charging monstrosity in time? 不. Did you think you found good cover from? No. In the first level of the game I felt like I deserved a parade at every check point. But soon enough, I realized I was just being lazy. I loved Doom, Quake, and Unreal Tournament growing up. I had babied my FPS muscles and was suffering from atrophy in the L33t skillz area. With that in mind, I stepped up my game and started being more careful, more precise. I still died a lot, but now I was learning. I still felt supreme satisfaction, but I also gained a newfound respect in the balance. The game was trying to train me, and get me used to playing a shooter where I don't just respawn 2 seconds away, automatically regenarate all my health, or kill enemies in a few hits.All that being said, Hard Reset is not perfect. The story could not really hold my attention, though the art was kind of nice. The load times can be a longer than comfortable. I despise the autosave system: I could have a perfect run all the way up to one point, only to be killed out of nowhere and have to try to recover my balance in the next load. I also feel like I should point out that it is not the hardest game ever made. I make it sound extremely tough, but I do not consider myself really great at shooters. Challenge is very subjective: I found Hotline MIami to be moderately diffiuclt on my old trackpad, but I cannot play War of the Roses or Megaman to save my life.Hard Reset feels extremely refreshing and satisfying, while familiar at the same time. It has been bundled and been on sale frequently, so this is a solid, engaging experience worth checking out.			"

												After adopting the pros and cons way of reviewing a game, I'm going to re-review this game (if there's such a word).Overview:Hard reset is a game the happends in the future.It has many options and you don't just go and kill the enemies like most of the FPS games, you need to find secrets and destroy things like explosives or digital machines to open new areas.I enjoyed this game very much, it was very interesting, the maps were good, the story was awesome.Weapons here are nice because you can choose (plasma or rifle) your weapon path (you eventually get all of them).The enemies weren't to strong, but when they needed to be a bit hard, it was there.Many kinds of enemies, flying, running, giant, shooters, melee and more and more.Explosives - my best friend, may be yours as well!This game is replayable - you can just play it over and over in other difficulties without getting bored.Pros and cons:Pros:+Pretty long+Has good graphics+Has a good storyline+Voice acted+Has 'secrets'+Has achievements+Has many kinds of weapons+Has many upgrades of weapons+Has a free DLC+Has awesome boss fights+Challenging puzzles while fighting enemies+Has more than one difficultyCons:-No cards-Storyline is hard to understand-Has 'detectors' of various things (enemies, N.A.N.O, etc.)Bottom line: will get the 9 out of 10 :/ "

												Nice game, but I guess not really much of my type. I am more than midway through, will complete it but it's not my type.The game throws robots at you, and you keep shooting them. The robots are very good at killing you. What changes through the levels is that you upgrade your weapon systems, getting better and better ways to shoot them, and to protect you. There are secrets scattered all over, if you explore you find them. Most of the secrets somehow evade me.So that's it, you keep shooting the robots. It doesn't have any issues on playability though, the engine is smooth and solid, no irks.I'll give it a 60%.Addendum---------------Well I didn't realize while writing the last review, I actually completed the non-DLC game by then, and just entered the DLC Exile. Completed exile now, more of same thing. Also adding some more words to the the vocabulary of the main protagonist, major Fletcher, other than ""Fuuuuck!"" would have been nice...			"

												This game is a great cyberpunk themed shooter with some excellent gunplay and creative enemies. the game is set in a post-apocalyptic future where machines are trying to wipe out humans. you play as major Fletcher, who is trying to stop the machines. and that's about all there is to the story. there are a few plot twists here and there and the ending sets up a sequel, the story isn't the strong point of the game, it's all about the shooting. the main part of the game is obviously shooting and hard reset is one of the best. all the weapons feel very responsive and have some very cool designs. the is plenty of enemy variety and some very creative/epic boss fights with giant machines. there are only 2 weapons in the game but each one has about 5 upgradable firing modes. for example you can make the plasma blaster shoot matrix style electricity.Aesthetically it reminds me of films like the matrix and the fifth element. Graphically the game blew me away, it's gorgeous! every level has so much detail in everything and has great lighting especially in the subway levels. the game's also well optimized and ran at a constant 60 on my rig. the game also has some nice futuristic sounding music and overall the sound design is great. i highly recommend this game if you're into cyberpunk or just good fps.

												pros;- fantastic graphics- unique & original gameplay given the fps format- some physics in the way the enemies break as you shoot them & eventually die, same with environmental effects with objects flying aboutcons;- environment although stunning becomes a little drab due to it not really changing- swapping weapons or the weapon mode is a bit clunky on the gamepad- enemies can be relentless, no real AI at play so they just head right for you- quite difficult because of the above- game is maybe a little long given the lack of diversity in enemies & scenery6/10			"

												A 12 mission corrider shooter where you can't jump over barriers or crouch under obstacles. It took me around 16 hours to complete it on normal. There will eventually be 10 weapons to choose from, but most likely you would focus on 3 or 4. I went mortar/shotgun at the start then switched to smartgun/mortar/rpg at the end. Not any really jumping puzzles, but I did kill myself from falling or jumping somewhere I shouldn't have a few times. The game uses a checkpoint save system. At worse, i think you would have to repeat 5 to 10 minutes of content if you died. I think there was a boss battle at the end of each mission and I think there was at least 3 big boss battles. My old 2008 XP computer did freeze and crash several times during gameplay, usually when there were a lot of enemies on my screen. It is unlikely I will play this game on harder difficulty levels or probably play the game ever again, but for $1.49, I definately think it was worth the money.			"

												An appealing dark cyberpunk FPS game that plays more like an oldschool style of shooter. There's no cover system or regenerative health, no pressing E/F to pick up items (walking over them simply grabs them.) A no nonsense, no fuss game, yet it still offers a nice array of interesting weaponary to play with & upgrade using ""NANO Currency"" you collect.  The game is pretty full on in the way of lots of things that can be destroyed, but mostly the fact that it can get extremely chaotic very quickly. Making sure you move around while shooting is essential. Worth noting is there isn't any quick save option, instead you get spawned back to the last checkpoint. I found this a little frustrating, but in fairness checkpoints aren't too far apart.  Campaign mode takes more or less around 8 hours to finish, but it does offer achievements and a survival mode to add further hours of gameplay.   I enjoyed the game, but unlike some other games I think Hard might be too challenging for my taste.			"

												This is quite a surprising game. Like if you took a solid fps from 90s, upgraded visuals/sounds to ""modern"" standards and threw it on the market full of easy faceroll shooters (often filled non-fps features of dubious quality). A bold move.So, what does the game do well ? It doesn't try to be something else. It's a railroad fps in the best traditions of games like unreal, quake, hexen, halflife and so on - it's a superb journey to genre sort-of forgotten. /But/ - you have to like this kind of games. Not everying is perfect either (see a few highlights below) of course, but then again - what is ?A few details (all from ""insane"" difficulty PoV where applicable):* difficultyI'm happy to report the game is quite challenging. This is a great refresher after many AAA titles that generally fail miserably in this department. The game will put both your hands and your head to test - and that's great.* controlsCompared to past fpses, the authors decided to ignore crouching (not a big deal tbh, though it feels strange initially) and the jump is of very limited use (think of it as something a bit more realistic, no practical use during fights).* savesNo manual saves, though the checkpoint system is mostly well made as far as pacing goes. Probably of little/no issue on easier levels, but on the hardest level you might rarely fell into some short loops skewing a bit towards Dark Souls experience ;)* storyWell, there's some stuff between chapters (in form of ""moving"" comic) and to lesser extent during the gameplay. No complaints, but nothing special or extensive. Then again - the game is not about the story ;)* visuals, soundPuts to shame many games few times more expensive.* optionsEverything important seems to be there. Menu animations can be mildly irritating (they are off during the gameplay though)* HP and stuffNo autoregen :). Though shield and energy reserves (ammo) regenerate automatically - you still lose some hp after taking stronger hits. TBH it works ok - though there're perhaps a bit too many supplies - and on top of that enemies often drop some ammo/hp. "

												I had never even heard of this game when I gave it a try. It came with a Humble Bundle. It was a more than pleasant surprise. It's an old-school shooter (no health regen, more than two weapons, slippery movement). It does incorporate newer conventions such as upgrades, and you sorta only have two weapons, but they can do much more than when you start the game once you upgrade them. The biggest draw the game had for me was it is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ beautiful, technically and aesthetically. The environments and enemies are very Cyber-punk. I think there was a story in the game, but I could care less about it. Who needs it when you have such solid shooting and breathtaking graphics.			"

												Hard Reset is a nice shooter. The longer I played the game the more I liked it. It's actually a good sign if you finish a game and feel like playing it all over again right away. The problem with this game is, it's not quite easy. Some say the game is too hard, even on normal difficulty. I thought it was OK on 'normal' although quite challenging. I had to give up on my second play-through because I tried it on 'madness', the second highest difficulty. It was simply impossible. Nevertheless, if on sale, I very much recommend this game, if you don't mind a challenge.Pros:- nice graphics- good level design- interesting weapon design, your weapons can be rifle, shotgun, rocket launcher, grenade thrower and mine thrower at the same timeCons:- story- can be tough at times- impossible to survive on higher difficultiesPS: I played this game with controller so I don't know how it plays with a mouse and keyboard.

												Got this after thoroughly enjoying Shadow Warrior, but unfortunately it's not up to the same standard. It's very pretty and the weapon system is interesting, but its major flaw is that it tries to emulate old-school shooters but then instead of making you as mobile as you were in those games, movement feels like it's copied from gears of war. The slow and clunky movement works in GoW because the game is designed around it and you're supposed to use cover, but that's not the case here. Imagine playing Doom with your knees (well, the protagonist's knees) taped together... not fun.			"

												Played on: i5 3570k @ 4.3GHz, GTX 970 @ +100/+300, 8GB DDR3 @ 1600MHz, Samsung 850 Evo, Windows 10 64Price paid: 99pTime to finish: 5 hours 50 minutesScore: 6/10Recommended?: Yes, only when on sale thoughYeah, not bad overall. The gunplay was satisfying, the weapon upgrades were a lot of fun to use, the enemies were fairly varied and the final area was really well done and enjoyable. They didn't reinvent the wheel but the game is fun to play for the most part and it's not too long either which to me is a plus, a lot of games these days tend to overstay their welcome. I also enjoyed their comic book style cut-scenes.Hard Reset does have some major flaws though, the first is the voice acting and dialog, it's best described as cringe-worthy and amateur, there was only one major character that wasn't laughable, and sadly it wasn't the main one. I can't tell you just how bad it was, you need to experience it for yourselves. Another big problem was a surprising one, performance, I couldn't maintain 60fps on any visual preset, drops into the 40s were common on the major boss battles and even some smaller events, I can only imagine how poorly this ran on 2012 hardware. The final complaint was the constant micro-freezing whenever the game autosaved which was often enough to annoy me. So there you have it, Hard Reset is an OK shooter that does have some fun moments but suffers with performance issues and comically bad voice work, for 99p I'd say it's well worth a shot if you're bored and have run out of better games to play.

												Fun and intense combat amid some pretty beautiful sci-fi landscapes, but it's all in service of the blandest and most generic kind of FPS. Even the aforementioned landscapes get a little samey after a while, as does the enemy variety. There's exploding ball, chicken saw thing, humanoid thing, biped thing, flying thing, and insect thing. I think that covers it?Say what you want about other 'old school' shooters such as Painkiller, but at least that game had a vast array of environments and enemies, every level gave you something different to look at and it never became visually stale. I guess the moral of this review is if you HAVE to play a dumb FPS, buy that instead.			"

												This action-packed, challenging FPS is very reminiscent of Croteam's legendary Serious Sam games where you are swarmed by dozens of enemies almost at any given time and you need to shoot through hoards and hoards of robots who are hell-bent over tearing your insides out. BUT, unlike Serious Sam games, the levels in which you fight these ever increasing number of enemies are MUCH more confined and closed when compared to the former game's large, arena like levels. This will probably lead to a lot of frustration as you barely have any room to maneuver around dozens of enemies running towards you or shooting at you. It doesn't help much that the main character runs so slow and his running dash is so short and pathetic it doesn't help at all. Therefore dodging enemy attacks becomes a game of sheer luck rather than skill.Another negative thing for me in this game was the weapons system. You have 2 main weapons that can be upgraded to embody more shooting modes for different situations (e.g. your standard assault rifle can be upgraded to also accompany a rocket luncher and a shotgun etc.) The problem arises when you are in the heat of battle and need to switch between different weapons in order to utilize their abilities in combat situations. Since this is a fast and frentic game very similar to older shooters, it becomes really awkward to switch from a weapon to another one and THEN selecting the desired shooting mode with the mouse wheel. Sometimes you barely have time to think because of all the chaos happening on screen and switching guns can lead to untimely deaths. The graphics look gorgeous albeit repetitive. The DLC included extends the base game by a few levels which look different and are a welcome addition to the abruptly ending vanilla game.Sound and music are very nicely done and fit the action perfectly. You should definitely not expect any coherent story in this game. This is a action shooter at heart and doesn't give two pennies about storyline. Make sure you use environmental explosives and traps as much as you can because they will save your life and help you defeat the baddies with more ease. All in all, I can describe this game as Serious sam in the future and with much more cramped, tight levels. It'll take around 10 hours to beat counting the Exile DLC. Base game will take around 6 hours to complete. It got a bit repetitive for me halfway through because all you are basically doing is pushing switches to get to the next area to kill more enemies. there are a couple of boss fights that are amusing if nothing else.If you know what you're going in for, then expect your adrenaline glands to pump non stop. This is a very solid shooter that knows what it wants to be and what it wants to do is take you back to the sweet haydays of golden shooters of past while relentlessly challenging you with every encounter. A casual gamer will find passing some of the levels pretty hard.			"

												As far as First Person Shooters go, Hard Reset is really quite generic in flavor. You traverse very linear levels and use your two guns to kill several varieties of homicidal robot. Despite this, something about it keeps charming me back for more. That ""something"" is more likely the difficulty. Hard Reset is exceedingly difficult, and getting through any given fight without taking a death carries a certain amount of satisfaction.The game could be described as ""old school"" style. Your health doesn't regenerate, requiring you to find healing pickups. The action is fast-paced and aggressive, favoring a DOOM-like method of remaining constantly mobile as you fight. Generally speaking you travel from fight to fight, with a few smaller fights in between the larger ones. However, unlike many shooters of this type, success is not tethered to reflexes because frankly, the player character has no reflexes. Although his movement speed seems fast, he is easily outran by most enemies. Sprinting increases speed by 25% at best and lasts for about 3 seconds, making it largely useless. Jumping is poor and used almost exclusively for getting over scripted obstacles. Instead the game favors strategy and planning, often requiring at least one death in the larger battles to get an idea of the better method of handling things, where to take the fight, what order to kill enemies, ideal weapons to use, and so forth. This is why it's so satisfying to survive a battle on the virgin attempt. The game seems to know this, as there's an achievement for surviving any one level other than the first without dying. Curiously, the player cannot crouch. This wouldn't be a big deal except for the large number of instances where you're told to find a way to get past an obstacle when you can plainly see that it'd be possible if your character would just bend down, slightly. It happens so frequently that at times it almost seems like the game is making fun of its own mechanics.Technically you only carry two weapons throughout the game, a more standard type and an electronic type, but each one can be upgraded in a variety of ways to give it very different functionalities. By default your regular gun is something of an assault rifle and your electronic gun is a close approximation of DOOM's plasma rifle, but as you add more bells and whistles to each gun, you'll find yourself with weapons such as a shotgun, rocket launcher, tesla cannon, railgun, and more. The electronic weapons are usually the more useful of the two types, but every weapon has its pros and cons. several weapons include a secondary fire which stuns and/or immobilizes foes which is a must if you hope to be successful, as the machines tend to be much faster and more maneuverable than the player.The level design is fairly good and atmospheric, especially if you're a fan of cyberpunk themes. I'm not, but it's still a pretty good environment, many of the stages taking on a seedy inner-city feel loaded with cheap advertisements and littering. The game includes secrets but often times, these ""secrets"" are nothing more than money-items hidden behind a large object. There are several instances where an item will be counted as a secret and an item hidden in an almost identical way will not be. Despite the secrets, the level layouts are very linear and don't lend themselves to much exploration. Most of the time you're heading from point A to point B, maybe stopping to check out a few nooks and crannies on the way.The story is told between levels through animated comic book-style artwork with not-so-great voice acting and swearing that almost seems forced. The story itself is, frankly, almost incomprehensible. In fact it is this seemingly impossible blend of confusingly complicated and yet entirely uncompelling. You know really know what's going on and yet, you don't really care to know. The ending creates more questions and answers and seems like it might have been meant to set up for a sequel that is probably never coming. Perhaps the story was poorly translated, but whatever the reason, it's arguably the game's weakest point and can almost entirely be ignored with little ill effect on the gameplay.But all the same, despite the game's very middle-of-the-road quality, I found myself repeatedly coming back to it in order to try and step up to the challenge. For that reason I would recommend the game to anybody looking for a fast and simple shooter with a steep challenge, though I might suggest getting it on sale.			"

												I definitely recommend this game. The story makes very little sense, but the story is not important. What is important is the solid difficulty, the number and variety of enemies, the impressive sci-fi/cyberpunk setting and the weapons. The weapons are excellent, and allow you to pull-off a variety of combinations. For example you can fire a vacuum grenade to suck enemies into one group, then switch to the rocket launcher and blow them to pieces.  The graphics are smooth, and the level design has a nice combination of open areas and corridors. So much of the environment is destructible which you will need to utilise to fight off the hordes of enemies. A must play for fans of old-school shooters like Doom, Serious Sam and Duke Nukem.			"

												Hard Reset is modeled on ""old school"" video games such as Quake and Unreal, which results in more straightforward gameplay than most modern first-person shooters. However this game is jam packed full of cool secret area's and massively upgradable guns, if you like high intensity, fps games with alot of bullets flying. then i would recommend this game to you. 7/10			"

												Interesting game by shallow story that includes. Any modern city enviroment is included in game but it has a lack of post processing effects due huge city maps. Effects are always close and personal. All other textures seem static. But when the action gets running, all experienced players stay fraped by extra action on hard level. Good game, a real reflesx shooter.			"

												Summary:An old-school shooter to the core with beautiful cyberpunk environments, challenging combat, waves of enemies and a unique weapon system. Held back by awful voice acting, awful music, cheap cutscenes and a half-hearted story that explains little. Unfortunately, you often feel powerless against the chaos because there are no effective ways of dodging, it's easy to get trapped in a corner or have one of the countless explosive hazards set off a deadly chain reaction. Defeating certain enemies is very difficult without specific weapons which you may not have bought earlier. But if you're here purely for the vintage shooter action, you won't be disappointed, as it offers plenty of challenge.The full story:Hard Reset is a real mixed bag, and certainly not for everyone. It's an old-school shooter to the core, featuring only minimal controls and no extra bells and whistles, just you and waves of robotic enemies. The enemies, even on normal difficulty, can be quite challenging and are good at dodging attacks. They love to ambush you at every turn, flank you, and can quickly whittle down your health if you don't keep moving; you must always be ready for a battle and think on your feet to survive. There are different types, some which explode in your face, others which charge at you, and some that stay at a safe distance and snipe away... with rockets. The few boss fights are challenging and old-school as well, involving glowing weak points and waves of minions, but when you learn their pattern you feel unstoppable. For the most part, combat is challenging, but fair; if you fail, you know it's your fault. On the other hand, the little guys are a lot more troublesome because they love to hide and ambush you, get right in your face and when they die, they cause damage if you're that close. Every single room in the game is filled with destructible objects which either explode or cause electrical damage, so you can imagine that one stray bullet, even from the enemy, often sets off a chain reaction of things exploding in your face. At times like these, the game feels unfair. Dodging or jumping doesn't always save you, enemies sneak up behind you with ease and it's easy to get trapped in a corner, so many situations turn into trial-and-error. Some enemies love to hang out at a distance behind cover and are difficult to destroy with anything but one or two weapon types which you can't even buy until later on. Rockets and mortar shells constantly fly at you and FPS logic tells you that if you're behind cover or sprint several feet away from its impact, you'll be safe... but not always. Enemy projectiles' splash damage has a ridiculous reach.Your own weapons are still formidable, however. You get only two (with separate ammo types), but a whopping five firemodes apiece, each of which is designed for certain situations. You have the minigun, grenade launcher, rocket launcher, railgun, shotgun, proximity mines and my favorite, the smartgun which detects enemies and shoots through walls. You can also upgrade your weapons, health and armor through seamless first-person terminals, using experience you collect from combat and finding secret areas. But even if you fully upgrade your health and shield, it's not by much; Hard Reset doesn't hold your hand and the only assurance you have is frequent checkpoints and no game over. The only guidance you have is a vague objective and the occasional voiceover communication.Speaking of which... the voice acting is awful. With the exception of one guy, it's just ingenuine and unenthusiastic. The music is also total crap, consisting of the occasional ambient pad and a bunch of random futuristic drilling noises, like a robot dentist's equipment. Apparently, the composer didn't care either, but at least it lets you know when you're entering a fight. There is actual music when action begins, but it's your average, generic attempt at sounding futuristic: lots of synths, breakbeats and the occasional guitar. Completely forgettable at best, grating at its worst.The sound on the other hand, is great. Every little object you bump into sounds real, the sound of robots exploding into piles of scrap is satisfying and the weapons sound appropriately futuristic and cool.The visuals are gorgeous. That should be obvious considering it's on the Unreal 3 engine, but the environments look amazing. The dystopian city of Bezoar stretches out around and above you, massive and intricate, triggering memories of Blade Runner or Hong Kong from Deus Ex: Human Revolution. So many scenes in this game deserve that you stop and just take a  look around. It's such a shame then, that this game is fast-moving and direct by its very nature. The models and textures are beautiful; things that anyone would be proud to put on their resume. Most props fully utilize the Havok physics engine and behave realistically, never once glitching for me. The layout of certain objects in certain places doesn't always make sense, but it's still cool to see things fly everywhere in the heat of battle.I'll mention the story last because it's not important. In fact, it's barely there at all. In between levels, what little plot there is is expounded through cutscenes which look suspiciously like rough draft cinematics; you know, a comic book of moving sketches designed to give an idea of what the finished, pre-rendered cutscene will look like. But there's a difference between stylish, comic book cutscenes (see: Beneath a Steel Sky, Max Payne 2) and a rough draft someone never finished. Anyway, the story has something to do with a network of digital personalities, the big, faceless, evil corporation that controls it and robots that want it. Very little is ever explained, leading to more confusion. But again, it's not that important because when you're playing, you only get a vague objective to strive for and the occasional voiceover telling you what to do next, very little context or exposition. And that's another thing: The environments, visuals and sound design make me want to explore this world, understand it, spend some time in it, but that just ain't gonna happen.It's a very short game too; if you spend no time collecting secrets and are better at staying alive than me (which is likely), you'll blaze through it in no time and wonder what the Hell just happened. The Exile DLC is included, although it's more like ""almost half the game the developers didn't have time to finish before release"". Seriously, it's a continuation of the main game, and if you don't have the DLC, it ends abruptly after a boss fight with no explanation. Still, it's free, so you can't complain too much. It also takes you outside the city, into outdoor environments like a machine scrapyard full of encroaching greenery, introducing a few new pesky and challenging foes in the process. Still, it's quite short and (at least for me) becomes a grind, repetitively blasting away, clicking a panel, walking forward, rinse and repeat. Once you complete normal, more difficulties open up along with a survival mode.But like I said, this game isn't for everyone. If you love old-school shooters but want a modern presentation, if you want a good challenge and can stomach some unforgiving mechanics and if you love cyberpunk settings but can deal with a minimal story, this should be right up your alley.

												A quality single player shooter enhanced by additional levels appended onto the original base game, a.k.a. the extended edition.  Enemy variety could be more varied and the save system is based on checkpoints though they're liberal enough not to cause severe frustration though I have to admit to a couple of F-Bombs and ALT F4s.  The weapon system is based on 2 guns, each with multiple modes.  An interesting attempt to redefine the first person shooter but I think it fails as the system is needlessly clunky.  With the energy weapon in hand, selecting the rocket launcher requires a key press for the host weapon and another for the launcher mode.  Why?  In the heat of battle I felt like a circus performer.  What's worse is that I found the controls to be somewhat unresponsive, no doubt a purposeful design decision to negate any type of weapon mode key press while sprinting.   Despite the flaws, the well realized world reminded me of Blade Runner infused with a bit of Rapture.   The level design, graphics and solid shooting mechanics are enough reasons to play.  Oh did I mention the Quake like rail-gun.  My favorite weapon in the game, though like some of the other weapon modes there is a cool down so spamming anything but the base weapon modes is prohibited.  Weapon upgrades are acquired through upgrade terminals.  This mechanic does enhance the standard fps as the expenditure of the in game currency, called nano, allows for complete customization of your play-through.   The story I thought was well penned but is presented like a comic book.  There are multiple modes once your done with the game though I had little desire to partake.  One mode, called EX allows you to play the game with all weapon and defense upgrades in place.  Another mode, called Heroic allows for one save point at the beginning of the level.  The last is standard Survivor mode where the game throws waves of enemies at you.    I've read that the development team has roots in both BulletStorm and Painkiller.  The quality with which Hard Reset was constructed bears the fruit of that lineage.  It's a great shooter and worthy of your time and slot in your library.			"

												Story : The game takes place in a dystopian futuristic world where the machines took control over pretty much everything and you are a lone soldier who was betrayed by this organ of the government he worked for and tries to find other signs of human life in this city.  The story kinda doesn't make sense, i mean you don't know if you have a past or smth you are just a soldier who fights the machines and that's it.It isn't very long, it has like 7 levels but trust me they are INTENSE, and besides that it has a free dlc who adds 5 more levels (new enemies also) which are more intense than the vanilla game itself. You also have a new difficulty (heroic mode) which is harder than the insane difficulty, i recommend heroic for veterans in old school FPS . Finished it for the first time on hard and i gotta say i didn't went into this as easier as a knife into cheese. Graphics: tbh i don't kinda care about them but they look ok, sound : good , Gameplay : ok Length : it took for me between 15-20 hrsDo i recommend it? Yes, overall it's  a good game, a good cheap game and, like i said, if you are looking for story rich old games, this isn't the right place to look at, but if you want an intense, somewhat scarry ( at some parts ) experience which isn't eating your wallet, oh yea boy you are in the right place. Replayability: For me, yes since i didn't knew some achievments are unlocked only on the top difficulty.			"

												A First-Person Shooter taking place in a dystopian 24th century setting where machines have taken over much of the planet and only a few scattered, human cities remain. WASD controls with mouse targeting. There are two weapon types: a physical-based weapon for bullets, grenades and an RPG, and an energy-based weapon for plasma, electricity and laser railgun. Various alternate-weapon modes for scopes, stun and seeking rockets. Left-mouse for firing; right-mouse for alternate mode. You can also target objects in the environment to create explosions or electricity discharges that will destroy the enemies for you, but if you're too close, you'll take damage as well.Ammo is plentiful as are healing power-ups, and the machines drop them as well. Lastly, there is a 'nano' resource that you need in order to unlock and upgrade weapons, and you can improve health, shield and recovery rates as well.The enemies, of course, are the machines. They range from small anti-personnel devices with blades, saws and explosives, through human-sized robots using energy-blasts, rockets or brute-force ramming, up to huge, towering bosses with multiple, active weak-spots that need to be destroyed in order to take the thing down. The saving is automatic at checkpoints and the zones between those checkpoints are pretty small, so reloading after defeat may cost you maybe five minutes of gameplay.The graphics are good with decent explosions, discharges and flying pieces but not top-notch and no particle effects. Maxed-out, everything runs smoothly on Windows 7 with 16GB, a 990X CPU and SLI-coupled Nvidia 970's. There were no glitches, crashes, lock-ups or slow-downs.The story that underlies the game is only partially present and things go on that don't make a lot of sense, nor does the ending resolve anything presented throughout the game, but it's enough of a shell to make the activities coherent and move the game forward.It is a solid FPS, and mostly you'll be mowing waves of enemies down. You have to keep moving and using the environment for protection or you can easily be overwhelmed. Overall, it takes maybe 10 hours to complete a run-though, so it's a distraction for a single day, and there is some replayability though different weapon choices, as well as improving performance and finding all the scattered nano and secret areas. Nothing beyond nano is found in the secret areas, though.Recommended. "

												Questionable level design and awkward shooting. Shadow Warrior remake (by the same studio) is essentially the same game but polished. Consider that game instead; this one I cannot recommend.NOTE: I always play games on the hardest available difficulty level. PROS:-Cool voice actingNEUTRALS:-The ""all in one"" weapon is functionally the same as multiple weapons that simply share ammo. -There are 2 weapon types (ammo and energy) which each have 5 subtypes to them. Unfortunately, the 5 subtypes are literally identical between the two weapons....major missed opportunity and lazy design.CONS:-Some enemies simply stand there trading damage with you regardless of what weapon you hit them with or where you shoot them. This becomes especially problematic in areas against several waves of enemies as you may end up in a situation where you simply don't have enough health to kill the next wave of enemies no matter how you play it.-AWFUL level design. Far too many enemies in almost every area; areas lead to constant dead ends; areas too small for types of enemies being fought.-Most enemies take a frustratingly large number of shots to kill.-Your shots will go right through enemies quite often (I'm talking about your rockets going straight through their stomach kind of thing).

Graphics are good in this game, sound is okay, but could've been better. If you want to shoot things and have minldess fun or a good challenge, then get this game.

												Hard Reset is a great example of a classic-styled PC shooter done right. What I like most about this game is it's setting, a cyberpunk future on earth - with added killer machines that simply want you dead. Gameplay-wise, Hard Reset is a real 'blast' to play, and by 'blast' I mean - you can pretty much blow up something around every corner! Which of course comes in handy due to how overwhelmed you can be with so many enemies trying to gut you at once.I would recommend this game to anyone who has loved either Doom, Deus Ex, System Shock or just even if you have a thing for futuristic cyberpunk world settings, such as you would see in Blade Runner.

The gameplay is immensely satisfying and addictive and, besides the checkpoint system that sometimes leaves your keyboard and/or controller a crumbling mess of plastic tatters, old school as it hoped and promised to be.The story and characters are as empty as others say, but it also feels like nothing more than a 4.5-hour prologue, and as such there's room for development into something pretty darned cool.

												""Hard Reset"" is hard, really hard. I don't like the so called ""retro"" or ""old school"" shooters, which this game seems to pay homage to. Despite it all, I somehow loved ""Hard Reset"".You're Major Fletcher, a human badass with bionics who fights all kinds of robots who want to take over the world. You've got only two weapon types - one that fires hard ammo, another with energy charges. Each of the two weapon-types can morph into different weapons. For example, the hard ammo type can become a rifle, a shotgun, a grenade launcher, an RPG, and a mine launcher. Each weapon-mode can further be enhanced to feature alternate fire modes. In short, there's actually a lot of weapons to choose from, and to survive you'll have to switch between them a lot.The enemies are BRUTAL. Even the weakest ones can kill you with little to no effort if you're not careful. The enemies come in mini waves, and each wave is very much lethal. You can get blasted to pieces in a second, if you don't dodge, run, and shoot appropriate targets with appropriate arms. There's an amount of strategy involved here, too, although the game does at rare times feel cheap due to the sheer amount of enemies it throws at you. The few boss fights are pretty damn impressive, too. ""Hard Reset"" will challenge you a lot; it took me 17 hours to beat it on my first run ever (on Hard), because I died a whole lot. Yet I never truly felt like quitting, because the game always made it obvious WHY you died and WHY it was entirely your fault: you backed yourself into a corner, you ignored the little enemies, you chose your weapons poorly... every time I died, it just motivated me to try once again and turn those damn machines into scrap.The game also seems to be nicely optimized, since it ran at 55+ FPS with medium-high settings on my rather weak HP laptop.Criticism goes towards kinda samey level design, and the ""Secret Area"" mechanic, which often felt more like an in-game glitch. One example is walking on very tiny ledges - otherwise it's not possible, but on a specific level suddenly you CAN walk those ledges, but only on this exactly pre-defined spot in the level because a secret is hidden at the end of it. That kind of thing.But overall, ""Hard Reset"" turned out to be a hidden gem, and a true surprise. So yeah, recommended!			"

												This game is an enjoyable, classic-feeling FPS. There are enough waves of enemies, boss fights, and interesting guns to evoke memories of classic shooters. The story is pretty generic for a futuristic game, but it is has entertaining enough gameplay to keep one's interest for the duration of the campaign. I wouldn't say it has a high replay value, but if you catch it while a sale is occurring, I don't think you'll be disappointed. If you enjoy classic FPS's with a modern feel, then you should consider purchasing Hard Reset. (The included extra goodies are nice too.)			"

												Even despite this game's age and somewhat cliche storyline, it's a wonderful buy for anyone that's a fan of the shooter genre. Plenty of bosses, weapons, gear, and anything you need as 'Fletcher' to destroy tons of bots. I mean tons of them. Literal tons. Some downsides would be the lack of cover and mobility options, but given the time Hard Reset's been out, and the familiarity that fans would have to other games like Metroid Prime, this is a must-have for any avid fan of classic, tasteful shooters.

												At first I kind of hated the game with all of these lesser flaws, but I did manage to like it a little. They even released free DLC to make up for the game's major downside; being quite short.Even small enemies are quite resilient to damage, and the game expects you to rely on enviromental hazards to take everything out quicker. Apart from that and avoiding poor upgrade choices, it's a decent and challenging game, just snag it when it's cheap if you're skeptical.			"

												Overall a satisfying if brief game, set in a slightly bizarre futuristic cyberpunk world, where AI controlled machines have arisen as mankinds primary threat, fighting to gain entrance into the last bastion of human civilization.  The protagonist played is none other than a secret police type, send on missions to halt and uncover infiltrations and deal with them in a violent manner.Sound great? Sadly, the storyline is a convoluted mess bordering on incomprehensible.  Having finished the game, I'm still not sure what was accomplished and what was going on.  With that major flaw aside, Hard Reset is an absolute blast, and captures the essence of the cyberpunk genre proficiently.You're given 2 weapons from the word go, and as you progress through the game, granted fairly frequent upgrade to bolster their capabilities and fire modes, rather than replace them with completely new guns. We're not talking minor changes either. but rather unlocking things like charged blast to electro-mortar to smart-gun style upgrades, which you'll find yourself rapidly switching between mid-fight to use deadly combo's to turn otherwise difficult enemies into scrap.The game starts out relatively difficult, almost to the point of being merciless, so if you're struggling, remember that in the future, lots of the cars, terminals and other machinery are highly volatile and explore with the gentlest of encouragement from your arsenal.   While the graphics are great, and the holographic style waepon upgrade interface is pretty cool,  I find it hard to overwhelmingly recommend this game due to the poor narrative. But, if you're the type to skip cutscenes, you'll probably find this worth your while.  There's potential here in the setting, so lets hope the developers make the most of it in any sequels.			"

												At first I didn't expect much of this game, but it turned out to be a whole lot more fun than I expected.The game feels a bit classic fps-like (think about run&gunners like Serious Sam).You ONLY fight ROBOTS in this game, but the game still feels really dark and intense.Though the game doesn't feature the most hardware consuming graphics, the looks are REALLY good. The use of colours, lighting, shadows and other effects are done extremely well in this game, I haven't seen many games done this as good as this game.The music may not be the grooviest of music you'll ever hear, but it is used really well in a way that fits the game. As soon as a wave of enemies is gonna attack you, the combat music will start playing, and the SECOND you finish off the last enemy the music comes to an end, which really boosts the atmosphere in a positive way.The game also features an upgrade system, which allows you to unlock new weapons and suit upgrades throughout the game. Wich each upgrade point you'll unlock, you'll probably be immediately rushing to the nearest upgrade station like a crack addict who just found a penny because the upgrades help A LOT.The weapon variation is done pretty well, though there are technically only 2 different types of ammo: you have 2 guns of many guns which will form all your weapons throughout the game.The game also features secrets, though they are mostly just nano (required for upgrade points).They did NOT go easy on the invisible walls in this game. Though this is usually no big deal since they are placed in rational locations, sometimes it can make secrets ""harder to find"" which might leave a bad taste in your mouth.The game has a storyline, but I didn't really feel it. The cutscenes are animated comic-style, which is kinda cool.If you like run&gunning with loads of explosions, the dark cyberpunk setting of the game and fighting robots you'll definitely like this game.

												It's a good shooter game. I liked the cyberpunk setting, but the world felt too static, even though you can use the environment to kill your enemies. The story was nothing special and couldn't made me care what exactly is happening. I liked the weapon mechanics and I'd probably play some more in order to see how the game feels if you decide to develop the blue weapon. The enemies were interesting (although not very diverse) and challenging enough that I couldn't pass a single level without dying. I'd recommend the game if you approach it without high expectations and just want to shoot, destroy and have some fun.			"

												This game was far better then expected. If you want, play the demo and get a feel for yourself. The game has some similarities to the Serious Sam and Painkiller type games. The only difference is the universe and the enemies. It's set in a cyberpunk universe with some pretty good visuals. What sets this apart are the guns and the enemies. Instead of having 15 different guns, you have 2 guns that have alternate modes that link to the 15 other weapons which makes for a different fighting experience. Also your enemies are 100% robots so figuring out how they die is tricky. Normal fleshy enemies you can figure out just how much will kill them. Not so here. Heck, there are a few enemies that are almost impossable to figure out how much will destroy them until they blow. Plus the boss fights for this game are superb and the dlcs they release are free! Those are some recipes for success in my book. The game isn't extremely long but it isn't short either. For a game I spent a few bucks on, this was a real winner in my mind. Play the demo to get your own feel then buy a fantastic no cover shooter game, you won't be disapointed.			"

Review:Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this is a bad game, it just wasnt for me. Yes, I said 'not recommended', but I'd call this a 50/50 review. I also have not finished the game yet.Hard reset is set in a heavily cyberpunk setting where robots have caused all hell to break lose. It can be related to the 'Serious Sam' franchise, and as a fan of those games I thought I'd give Hard Reset a go. There are a multitude of Pros & Cons, but it the end, it felt empty. The Cons side of the list started over-running the pros, the game was becoming too 'rinse and repeat' for me. It was like eating your Aunt's crappy fruit cake, but you don't want to make her feel bad so you keep on eating it anyway. Again, I'm not saying it's a bad game; just tiresome. The game goes by too fast too. After 2 hours of gameplay I found my self already about half-way through.Pros- - Appealing Graphics for it's time; about 4/5- Weapon Customization- Challenge: it has decent difficulty, even on easy.Cons-- Soundtrack, I can handle Techno/Dubtsep/DNB/Whateverelseyouwanttocallit music, used to love it in fact, but as a connosieur for OST's - all I can say is: ""what is this trash?"". I wouldn't even call it by those name as the majority of the songs sound like some pots being banged together. It's a good thing that even at max volume it's hard to hear the music.- Gameplay, it can be enjoyable to some people, but mostly iffy for me. It's a little Point-A-to-Point-B-ish and rinse and repeat on killing the same enemies- The Enemies: Lack of diversity; I think there were a total of 3 kinds of robots at the half-way point I made it to. There was: a ranged enemy. A bull vs. matador style enemy - which ends up being a big push over due to it being so easy to dodge, plus if there's more than one, you can make them damage each other. And finally these small♥♥♥♥♥exploding runts that run faster than light, making them the biggest threat in the game. They seem to never be farther away than four inches from you, meaning you're always hit by their explosion + they have razors if they make contact with you. There movement is usually predictable, so it isn't that hard to hit them, but they sometimes come in massive packs, so if you don't kill 'em fast enough you get overrun immediatly.- Balance in resources: Now this is absolutely nitpicking on my part, but I thought I'd point it out at the least. You get ammo out the♥♥♥♥♥and never run out, but health starts to become more and more uncommon the father along you go.TL;DR/EndingO.P.R.- Mixed Feelings. The game is okay. Not bad, but not good, unless you completely adore a game like Hard Reset, then I guess you'd call it good. I would give it a middle revied if I could, but personally I'm swaying a little more to 'Not Recommended'.			"

												It's very difficult at first enough for me to put it down twice- even on normal difficulty- but if you stick with it theres a really solid FPS here without all the dumb crap of modern military shooters, (like scripted sequences, ""epic"" moments, obligatory slow motion effects,  etc). It's fast and reminds me a lot of the older shooters (Doom and its sequel, Duke 3D etc) because it doesnt hold your hand the whole way through and the weapons pack a punch. Again, its difficult at first because your weapons seem a bit underpowered but after you get a few upgrades and play smart you'll be kicking♥♥♥♥♥in no time. 8/10			"

												""Hard Reset"" is hard, really hard. I don't like the so called ""retro"" or ""old school"" shooters, which this game seems to pay homage to. Despite it all, I somehow loved ""Hard Reset"".You're Major Fletcher, a human badass with bionics who fights all kinds of robots who want to take over the world. You've got only two weapon types - one that fires hard ammo, another with energy charges. Each of the two weapon-types can morph into different weapons. For example, the hard ammo type can become a rifle, a shotgun, a grenade launcher, an RPG, and a mine launcher. Each weapon-mode can further be enhanced to feature alternate fire modes. In short, there's actually a lot of weapons to choose from, and to survive you'll have to switch between them a lot.The enemies are BRUTAL. Even the weakest ones can kill you with little to no effort if you're not careful. The enemies come in mini waves, and each wave is very much lethal. You can get blasted to pieces in a second, if you don't dodge, run, and shoot appropriate targets with appropriate arms. There's an amount of strategy involved here, too, although the game does at rare times feel cheap due to the sheer amount of enemies it throws at you. The few boss fights are pretty damn impressive, too. ""Hard Reset"" will challenge you a lot; it took me 17 hours to beat it on my first run ever (on Hard), because I died a whole lot. Yet I never truly felt like quitting, because the game always made it obvious WHY you died and WHY it was entirely your fault: you backed yourself into a corner, you ignored the little enemies, you chose your weapons poorly... every time I died, it just motivated me to try once again and turn those damn machines into scrap.The game also seems to be nicely optimized, since it ran at 55+ FPS with medium-high settings on my rather weak HP laptop.Criticism goes towards kinda samey level design, and the ""Secret Area"" mechanic, which often felt more like an in-game glitch. One example is walking on very tiny ledges - otherwise it's not possible, but on a specific level suddenly you CAN walk those ledges, but only on this exactly pre-defined spot in the level because a secret is hidden at the end of it. That kind of thing.But overall, ""Hard Reset"" turned out to be a hidden gem, and a true surprise. So yeah, recommended!			"

												This game is an enjoyable, classic-feeling FPS. There are enough waves of enemies, boss fights, and interesting guns to evoke memories of classic shooters. The story is pretty generic for a futuristic game, but it is has entertaining enough gameplay to keep one's interest for the duration of the campaign. I wouldn't say it has a high replay value, but if you catch it while a sale is occurring, I don't think you'll be disappointed. If you enjoy classic FPS's with a modern feel, then you should consider purchasing Hard Reset. (The included extra goodies are nice too.)			"

												Even despite this game's age and somewhat cliche storyline, it's a wonderful buy for anyone that's a fan of the shooter genre. Plenty of bosses, weapons, gear, and anything you need as 'Fletcher' to destroy tons of bots. I mean tons of them. Literal tons. Some downsides would be the lack of cover and mobility options, but given the time Hard Reset's been out, and the familiarity that fans would have to other games like Metroid Prime, this is a must-have for any avid fan of classic, tasteful shooters.

												Quite enjoyable! Its an FPS in the same vein as Painkiller and Serious Sam, which means run-and-gunning, huge arsenals and a quantity of explosions that would make Michael Bay proud. If you like movies like Blade Runner, the cyberpunk setting will likely appeal to you. It's a nice backdrop, I'll admit, but after a while the bleak colour palette and repetitive environments might start feeling tedious. Luckily, at that point (around halfway through the game), the locations change up, and the enemy-variation and overall experience improves, in my opinion. These last five levels are part of the Exile DLC that is included for free, which is good because it also fixes one of the major problems critics had with the game at launch: the short length of the campaign. The story is a little convoluted, but it isn't especially important. For achievement-enthusiasts, this game is an utter joy: with a grand total of 115 achievements, of which the majority are obtained in tiers based on the difficulty played on, it doesn't take long to have those beautiful, grey rectangles sliding down the corner of your screen like the Star Wars opening crawl. Lastly, the gameplay is solid, and graphics hold up nicely today!8/10			"

												Hard Reset is one of those mindless shooters, that can be fun if you're only after some mindless FPS fun.It feels like a throwback to some games from the 90's and is simple but straight to the point.The story is pretty basic and well presented in a cyberpunk world, but overall the gameplay is enjoyable. However its one of those games that you really need to be in the mood for. Which in itself is not a bad thing.If you're looking for an old school, difficult mindless shooter then give this a go, or get the 'Redux' version with improved graphics for a little bit more dosh.

												Hard Reset is a cyberpunk FPS that is labelled as ""old-school"". These days there are a couple of such FPS games out there, notably Shadow Warrior, a remake from the same developer team. Hard Reset really delivers the old school: you have dozens of enemies sent against you at once, countless of objects you can destroy in the surrounding area (the game counts and rewards these environmental kills). What's more, the protagonist has weapons that do not require reloading - you just press and hold the button till all your foes are eliminated.Weapon-wise Hard Reset follows an interesting concept. You have two weapons and instead of mapping them to the numbers you can switch between them with the use of Q and E which are usually for ""previous"" or ""next"" weapons in the genre. As you make progress in the game the more nanocells you can pick up - these allow you to upgrade your two best friends thereby granting them extra firing capability. This is how you turn your rifle into a shotgun, then grenade launcher, RPG etc. The number keys are now unlocked and you can easily switch between these ""functions"" during a battle. It is an interesting concept, certainly.Graphics-wise Hard Reset looks stunning. Some of the effects are beautiful and if you look around you can easily notice the inspiration of various sci-fi authors such as Philip K.♥♥♥♥♥♥(to give you a hint: there are shuttles in the air with huge neon advertisements). The story is somewhat mediocre - there are comic book style cutscenes between the various chapters telling you the story of a major who wages a desperate battle against machines. These ""custcenes"" could have been better with a more appropriate voice acting.Do note that the game is very difficult. Many of the bigger enemies can easily kill you; using environmental kills is highly recommended due to the splash damage you can do with them. Running and jumping will be your best asset sometimes and even then you'll perish several times - the creators knew this that is why they included an achievement for not dying on a level.The game is short - 5-6 hours is enough to complete it. It is commendable that the developers released a free DLC that continues the story throughout 3 extra levels. You have the usual new-enemies-new-boss-new-environment deal here.Hard Reset is a very good game. If you miss the old school style FPS games you can give this one a try as it offers you top-notch graphics, achievements and replayability in case you want to try the higher difficulty levels, too.PS: Wow! I did not know Philip K. D.I.C.K's surname would be censored! :D			"

												Hard Reset is a decent game where you shoot robots and♥♥♥♥♥♥ There's a pretty unimportant and uninspired storyline. The jist is that there are robots wanting to kill all humans because humans wont let them get smarter. So they go on murderous rampages and humans keep em out with massive walls. You play as a soldier fighting against these robots (essentially). The voice acting is terrible too, and the cinematics are rather dull, however the game makes up for this in its combat.If you've ever played Serious Sam, you will understand how to play this game, as it's a case of finding and killing tons of robots that love to just run up at you. You have some objectives where you have to press this button or shoot that glowy thing, but all in all the combat is pretty easy to grasp. There is an upgrade system, which you get to use by using N.A.N.O. that you find laying around, or by killing enemies. Your starting weapons feature a machine gun and an energy gun that fires balls of energy, and use their own ammo. They can receive upgrades to have new functions (for example, the machine gun can become a shotgun or a grenade launcher).I've been enjoying the game since my friend purchased it for me, it reminds me a lot of Serious Sam. I have encountered one error, in where I entered a level to find every wall/floor/ceiling etc was invisible. I could see the skybox, and i could see some♥♥♥♥♥♥here and there but It was like I was floating in space. Apart from this odd experience... everything has been smooth. It runs well on my pc, which is fairly old. (GT 630 and 2.66ghz Quad Core (core 2) ).			"

												Extremely atmospheric masterpiece which takes place in a time where the machines claim our world over humanity. First it looked like a standard shooter, but later i learned to handle the very useful 10 in 2 weapon system and weapon upgrades which  call you up to collect all those secret nano's which are spread around in the dark and lonely streets of Bezoar and Barrens. If you play this game on higher difficulties you'll notice the tactical elements while fighting an overwhelming amount of machines with your crowd controlling weapon upgrades and exploding surrounding objects. This game really has some kind of ""terminator"" flair, and even a little bit of old 80s sci-fi in it, but with a cool modern look. Try heroic mode if you dare.Highly recommended!			"

												It feels like I have been dropped into the 2000AD comic series. It's like being right there.I seriously love the way this game looks. The city graphics are second to none for me, but I haven't played all the most modern games. Combat is great, if a bit tough at times. Combat with robots is extreme sublime. Although slightly short it has become one of my favourite gaming experiences. I played the demo a few times. I have played though on hard difficulty twice. My second play through took 12 hours including DLC levels. My first play through took longer partly because I was gawping at all the graphics. Really though I feel I am there in the comics, like they came to life, and I am in it. Incredible feeling. Awesome engine and concept.Hardware for max settings;A good i5 and GTX650 Ti will keep frames rates above 25fps with settings maxed. It will be well over 25fps in many places. This type of hardware will keep it smooth in the most heated battles.Hint:Make the shotgun your first upgrade. It is a game changer. Take the railgun and RPG upgrades soon, as again they are game changers. (The railgun is the only long range fast weapon. Other weapon types I did not even try.)I used these weapons and all the combat gear upgrades.Minor bad point:One or two of the checkpoints are a bit far apart.My fight with the first boss nearly stopped me playing, but youtube showed me I had to use different weapons.One particular secret I can not work out. I could look it up online.Shame it is slightly short, even with the free DLC. I just haven't had enough for such a superb concept game. (It takes longer than Crysis to play though.)			"

												It's pretty.  It tries to do something interesting with the weapon system.  That's about all the good I can say about it.The game mistakes ""challenge"" for ""swarming you with several hundred tiny enemies"".  Imagine HALO if The Archive had been the only part in the game.  Every single area area has tiny holes that are very obviously meant for the two tiny enemy types (walking tiny screwdriver, walking tiny chainsaw).  Attempts to create tension by having something run by just out of sight fall flat on its face and just make you groan, ""goddammit not this♥♥♥♥♥♥again.""  Literally every room has this happen.The offering of choice in weapon upgrades is purely illusory; if you don't take the specific upgrade paths intended by the designers, you are hilariously incapable of dealing with anything.  -EVERYTHING- is a bullet sponge.  There is very little variety in either location or enemies, and any rare moment of uniqueness is immediately spoiled by yet another uninspired slog through a sea of tiny screwdrivers and micro-chainsaws.  Many of the enemies are supposedly maintenence/industrial robots gone haywire, but the designs for the most part make no sense for their setting.  What in the world are all these bipedal chainsaws supposed to be used for?!  Speaking of things with no use, apparently everything in the future explodes in horriffically dangerous ways with the slightest provocation.  Not only that, you are expected to make use of all these wacky exploding background bits despite initially working for the city.The game tries desperately to invoke the difficulty of ""old school"" shooters almost as a badge of honor.  It fails miserably.  I can, to this day, pick up and play Doom 1 & 2 and other old shooters that Hard Reset claims to strive to be.  I really tried to give this game a chance, but it just falls flat.			"

												What to say about this title. I enjoyed it a lot but overall it fell short in my opinion. The weapons, even though there are only two base units, are very varied and enjoyable to use. The gameplay was not bad, but it was not outstanding either. It is fairly monotonous and very repetitive. The enemies are so so, they are all the same and do the same things. That being said the true enjoyment in the title is that it is a real challenge, like not even fair sometimes challenging. If you do not like games that kick you when you are down and steal your lunch money you will not like this. The world is very interesting; I loved the design of everything. I would have liked more enemy varieties but that is personal preference. But where this fell flat for me was in the story… there is none. Where there was any it didn’t make too much sense and the ending has an “Ok where is the rest of it” feel.I can’t recommend this at full price as in my opinion it has too many flaws, but the beauty of the  aesthetics and the joy of overcoming the challenge may well be worth it to some people. Either that or the unbelievable frustration will make you want to set something on fire.Well worth a play but don’t feel the need to finish it, seriously it's not worth it. It left me feeling hollow.Have fun? ^_^			"

												Hard Reset is a great game to spend time and beat. It has loads of secrets and achievements for completionists. Very fluid combat system as well, for the FPS-junkies. Good story if you want to follow the plot. The weapons are basic when you start out- A kinetic rifle and an energy rifle. Both have 4 different uprades (same with your defensive items) and 3 sub-upgrades, so each playthrough can be a little different from the last. Every level has a lot of enemies which always makes you feel like 'OH SH!T' every time you see a large group, and they always know you're there, so no super-sneaky type stuff either. *tip* invest in the railgun/shotgun early on to help out with tougher enemies.The only complaint is that the game is far too short, even with the DLC. Not to mention they left the ending in a cliffhanger type deal, leaving the player to imagine what happens next.But overall, 8.9/10			"

												Very nice graphics. Old school FPS gameplay style and a nice cyberpunk setting. And.. that's all the good things I can say about the game.You can barely hear the music since the sound effects are too loud, so there is no memorable tracks to hear. Even small enemies take way too much hits to die and that kinda makes the action scenes a bit stale and frustrating, the bigger enemies take even waaaaay too much hits to die, and the variety of enemies it's really not that great, the 2 or 3 types of smaller robots kinda look the same with small variances. There are many enviromental aids you can use to create explosions and electrical shocks but most of the time you end up screwing yourself up because when the enemies make one thing explode, the other ones near it explode too, so you end up having a quick death without knowing why.The story is kind of blend, I still have no idea what I'm doing there, all I know it's about some machines that entered in the city. The cutscenes are digital comic based so nothing major to speak of there. I would rate this game... 4/ 10 at best, only because the difficulty level represents a challenge for me.			"

I like the look and feel of the game, but overall it left a negative/neutral impression even though I finished the game (on normal difficulty, which was plenty hard for me). I guess my dislike for this game mostly boils down to some enemies being such bullet sponges or so annoyingly placed (suicide bombers in a narrow hallway, nice one) that they just feel cheap.			"

												What infuriates me about this game is how it tries to force you to use the environment. Weapons are deliberatly dumbed down to peashooter damage, goodluck trying to kill anything with them, even the smaller enemies are bullet sponges. This along with some god awful level design means its a pretty mediocre experience. The game often puts you in very awkward situations where you're cornered by several enemies at once in sometimes very tight spots. The smaller enemies shred through your HP regardless of difficulty mode along with their bulle and on top of that, the game uses checkpoints and no save option, I've had to replay through the same annoying section time and time again, it did not feel enjoyable in any way. This is only 2 hours in but honestly, I can't keep going through it. Please developers, learn how to make your levels evenly spaced out if you're going to litter them with enemies, DONT put me in a corridor shooter situation. Doom's levels can teach you a thing or two about the importance of open space. Admitidly  I was fascinated by its aesthetic choice, the art style is very appealing to me and it looked interesting but the gameplay just doesn't cut it.			"

												Hard Reset is a classical FPS wrapped in new clothing, and it does indeed rock the new outfit.Pros: - me likes the graphics, serving the atmosphere well and having one or two pretty cool effects to offer - slight RPG elements, but nothing to slow down the pace - straight forward strafing and shooting - awesome enemies, a bit dumb, but that hyasn't stopped Serious Sam from being great ;) - comic book cutscenes with above par voice over - there definitely went some thought into the level designCons: - absolutely nothing new in terms of story or gameplayVerdict:Hard Reset is a shooter for those melancholic about the old school of FPS. Bringing the classic gun handling and mobility from the 90s back, all nonsense is thrown overboard for a clean and fast paced action FPS that can surely hold its own.While it never excels in any one aspect, it does manage to keep you playing thanks to smooth gameplay and satisfying action, accounting to an overall very pleasant, some times Dark Soulsesque, game experience.

I will admit that I had to tone it down to 'easy' just to get halfway through it. Ever wish you could play Quake in a Blade Runner type of setting? This is the game for you.After completing the entire game I can say that it's very challenging. Getting cornered by hordes of common enemies was unfortunately more damaging than the actual boss fights. While you do get a chance to lay waste to thousands of little robots utilizing a variety of weapons, there is very little variety in the enemies themselves. The only thing that really changes through the game are the weapon upgrades and environments. The included Exile DLC does introduce a few more enemies.Overall, it's worth playing, especially if you're itching for an improved classic shooter that won't hold your hand.			"

												As others have mentioned, Hard Reset is something of a throwback to older FPS titles. While this isn't entirely accurate, it mostly is. There are some modern FPS trappings like invisible walls and the checkpoint save system. Challenge-wise it is definitely more like the older games. There is no arrow pointing you in the correct direction, or lengthy tutorial. It more or less throws you right into the action. There is a storyline along the way, which plays out in some very nice comic book-style cutscenes between levels and in-game dialogue via your radio. The cut scenes play while the game is loading, and you can skip them once the next level is done loading. You aren't forced to sit through them every time you play. One other thing about this is that the voice acting is pretty awful, even cringe-worthy at times. This is one of my main drawbacks and by far the worst part of the presentation, which, along with the graphic style, is otherwise one of the high points of the game.The game is still relatively linear but there are still some things left to figure out on your own. There are numerous secret areas and uncovering some of them can take some time. This is a nice touch that is missing from modern FPS games. One thing that is missing is quality puzzles. There just isn't much to speak of as far as puzzle solving goes. Aside from the secret areas, for the most part it never gets more complex than ""find and hit a switch"". That's not to say that's a bad thing, but it's missing that element of old school FPS games. The combat generally takes place in one of two settings: long narrow corridors with groups of enemies rushing at you from one end, and wider open areas where larger encounters take place. The enemies, which comprise of a variety of robots, tend come at you in waves, kind of like how Serious Sam works. Hard Reset doesn't throw nearly as many enemies at you though. There is a fair amount of enemies and each one tends to come in several varieties. Along with the game's 10 different weapon types, there is enough variety in the enemies and the ways to take them out that combat never becomes boring.There are multiple boss encounters along the way and they can be quite challenging. I played through it on the hard difficulty setting and most bosses I had to do multiple times. You can't just focus on the boss, as most of them spawn groups of the smaller enemies that kill you pretty quickly. The bosses typically have a glowing points that you have to blow up, so you have to pay attention and aim carefully (unless you acquire a certain weapon that will lock in and fire homing projectiles).You'll unlock multiple new weapons as well as upgrades to your health, armor and other attributes along the way. New weapons and upgrades are purchased spending at upgrade stations you find periodically throughout the levels. The game's currency, known as Nano, is earned by killing enemies and by finding it hidden in secret around the levels. I feel like a couple of the weapons and upgrades aren't very useful, and towards the end of the game you'll probably find yourself upgrading certain weapons or abilities just because you have upgrades to burn rather than because you need them. The new content unfortunately didn't add anything new to your arsenal. I feel like that's a wasted opportunity to add even just a few new upgrades. Overall I enjoyed my time with Hard Reset. I actually plan on going back and playing it again at some point down the road. That's rare for an FPS game. There is plenty to do, with multiple game modes and difficulties. There is also an achievement system if that's your thing. This is the best FPS game I've played since FEAR, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a better FPS to spend your money on.			"

												This is a very enjoyable shooter with lots of action, amazing graphics and a wonderfully authentic cyberpunk-atmosphere, but it's somewhat let down by an erratic difficulty and a relatively short campaign.I am left with the feeling that Hard Reset's title is not a reference to the game's plot or gameplay, but to the videogame industry as a whole. The developers are applying a ""reset"" to the entire FPS genre, stripping away or outright mocking several modern shooter staples.Hard Reset isn't a bad game, but it's rote old school sensibility has passed me by. I don't have the same kind of reflexes I did 5 or 10 years ago to properly appreciate the twitch elements, so maybe I have to take some responsibility on that front. For me, Hard Reset is unremarkable because it seems about 5 years too late for me.Overall, this is a game that does exactly what it sets out to do: be an oldschool manshoot, but with modern elements in the mix that make it more enjoyable, and a suitably wild Cyberpunk plot (albeit without any real hacking... ah, well, can't have everything).

The controls are tight, the combat is perfectly paced, and it keeps you interested the entire game.This is one of those games I didn't get into expecting much but reeled my in with its solid gameplay.This makes my official short list of games I actually completed.

												Hard Reset is a classical FPS wrapped in new clothing, and it does indeed rock the new outfit.Pros: - me likes the graphics, serving the atmosphere well and having one or two pretty cool effects to offer - slight RPG elements, but nothing to slow down the pace - straight forward strafing and shooting - awesome enemies, a bit dumb, but that hyasn't stopped Serious Sam from being great ;) - comic book cutscenes with above par voice over - there definitely went some thought into the level designCons: - absolutely nothing new in terms of story or gameplayVerdict:Hard Reset is a shooter for those melancholic about the old school of FPS. Bringing the classic gun handling and mobility from the 90s back, all nonsense is thrown overboard for a clean and fast paced action FPS that can surely hold its own.While it never excels in any one aspect, it does manage to keep you playing thanks to smooth gameplay and satisfying action, accounting to an overall very pleasant, some times Dark Soulsesque, game experience.

Hard Reset 
A Screenshot of Hard Reset
By: Friedmudkips ツ #FreeMilo




Hard reset is a morbid and gritty first person shooter set in a decrepit world that seems to have been taken over by soldiers made from a fusion of man and metal. The story is so incredibly vague and Hard Reset gives you so little to go on that the whole way it feels like you're being teased with what could have been an amazing story of a dangerous trek through a volatile and almost dystopian city. Instead you're left wondering about the context of some of the character exchanges and even in some cases, who these characters are. Seeing as there's no introduction to most of these characters you don't know whats going on half the time and the other half you're still trying to understand the last cutscene. A very important aspect of Hard Reset is that the developers took a very heavy inspiration from old style FPS games such as Shadow Warior, DOOM, and Duke Nukem and it really shows all throughout.


Boom

As I mentioned before the story is pretty sparse and when you end up being given story segments they're pretty lackluster and hard to understand. This means that Hard Reset essentially has little to no story or character development throughout the whole game. In this case however, I personally would say that Hard Reset is better with no story since that isn't what the game is focused on. Instead, since Hard Reset is essentially an old-school shooter from the 90's, the games main focus is on gameplay and mechanics rather than story and character development. Speaking of game mechanics, Hard Reset really feels like a classic FPS that's taken that genre and fine tuned it with modern game mechanics that are implemented in such a way that they subtly enhance gameplay without driving away the classic feeling. A huge downside to the game is that the level design is absolutely horrendous for a classic FPS since every level is incredibly linear with only a handful of side areas to explore and most of those aren't even side areas but instead are secret rooms with loot in them. This was incredibly disappointing since the environments the game lets you explore are absolutely gorgeous and would have been absolutlely stunning to explore. All the levels feel like you're window shopping at your favorite store; you see all the cool stuff but you have to just stay outside and look.


Away we go 
A Screenshot of Hard Reset
By: Friedmudkips ツ #FreeMilo




A critical mechanic in old-school shooters is gunplay and that's something that Hard Reset has absolutely nailed. You're only weapons are a futuristic plasma rifle and a run of the mill machine gun but both of the guns can change into one of many different forms. The plasma rifle can change into a rail gun or can let you see through walls and the machine gun can change into a shotgun or a rocket launcher. This unique take on gun mechanics makes Hard Reset very memorable and since you have to unlock every different firing mode, each one feels like an achievement to unlock and a powerhouse to use. The enemies you fight, as I mentioned earlier, are these macabre robot-human fusion monstrosities that range from being normal foot soldiers all the way to being giant mechs that are ten stories tall. Each different enemy type has different weaknesses to various different guns and you have to find those weaknesses and really push them to your advantage if you want to survive the later levels. My main problem with the enemies of Hard Reset is that there's only three or four different types of them and they start to get repetitive very quickly. Hard Reset could have been so much better if they just would have had a few more enemy types and made the game much less linear.TL;DRHard Reset creates an immersive world dominated by abominations of flesh and machine and throws you into it with nothing but guns and an attitude.If you found this review helpful or entertaining then feel free to join my Steam Curator Group at  Mudkips Gaming "

												A very unbalanced game design that will often have you killed because you were kicked in a corner and unable to move away, or enemies will spawn behind you without warning, and the enemies are boring. But the weapons are really fun.To be a bit more honest, that game suffers from 4 very bad problems :- the enemies are all faster than you. You can sprint to bypass that peculiar issue, but given that you can only sprint forward, that the levels are quite small, and that you can't shoot while sprinting, it's basically useless,- the levels are very beautiful, but sadly, they are filled with invisible walls. Graphically, you're moving in a futuristic town, but in fact, the game could just be a bunch of rooms and corridors,- I do not know how explosions are programmed, but a wall will never protect you from an explosion. I did the test of hiding myself in a container (three walls and a roofs) and yet I still took damage from explosions,- and the most annoying problem : that blur each time you get hit. No matter if that missile took 75HP or one, your screen will get blurred, making it impossible to see how your health is. And if you're ganged up on by enemies, you're done for. They'll constantly knockback you and kill you extremely quickly.Otherwise, enemies are fairly challenging, with a very decent tracking (that's a nice way to say ""you'll fail almost every evade and get charged by that giant angry robot""), but your weapons are diverse and powerful enough to not turn the fights into a chore.

												Beep-boop-beep-boop-BOOOM!!! Great graphics. Cool weapons. Terrible voice acting. Not a bad shooter overall. I will admit that I had to tone it down to 'easy' just to get halfway through it. Ever wish you could play Quake in a Blade Runner type of setting? This is the game for you.After completing the entire game I can say that it's very challenging. Getting cornered by hordes of common enemies was unfortunately more damaging than the actual boss fights. While you do get a chance to lay waste to thousands of little robots utilizing a variety of weapons, there is very little variety in the enemies themselves. The only thing that really changes through the game are the weapon upgrades and environments. The included Exile DLC does introduce a few more enemies.Overall, it's worth playing, especially if you're itching for an improved classic shooter that won't hold your hand.			"

												Great little first person shooter that combines fun old-school gameplay with strong enemy design (gameplay wise), strategic use of environmental damage, crisp graphics and an addictive weapon-update system that builds towards a very nice arsenal of weapons. The story is simple and complicated at the same time, it doesn't do much more than setting an atmosphere and showing some nice hand-drawn pictures. There isn't much variety in scenery other than a welcome switch halfway through and even the gameplay can be somewhat repetitive. However... it really is ""lots of fun to play for an hour a day"". The game is hard from the beginning (but luckily has well-placed checkpoints), forcing you to make maximum use of the hazards in your environment, save for upgrades, switch up your weapons and run around like crazy, resulting in a very satisfying payoff when you get through a tough fight. The perfect way to start or end your day.			"

												This is a very enjoyable shooter with lots of action, amazing graphics and a wonderfully authentic cyberpunk-atmosphere, but it's somewhat let down by an erratic difficulty and a relatively short campaign.I am left with the feeling that Hard Reset's title is not a reference to the game's plot or gameplay, but to the videogame industry as a whole. The developers are applying a ""reset"" to the entire FPS genre, stripping away or outright mocking several modern shooter staples.Hard Reset isn't a bad game, but it's rote old school sensibility has passed me by. I don't have the same kind of reflexes I did 5 or 10 years ago to properly appreciate the twitch elements, so maybe I have to take some responsibility on that front. For me, Hard Reset is unremarkable because it seems about 5 years too late for me.Overall, this is a game that does exactly what it sets out to do: be an oldschool manshoot, but with modern elements in the mix that make it more enjoyable, and a suitably wild Cyberpunk plot (albeit without any real hacking... ah, well, can't have everything).

												As others have mentioned, Hard Reset is something of a throwback to older FPS titles. While this isn't entirely accurate, it mostly is. There are some modern FPS trappings like invisible walls and the checkpoint save system. Challenge-wise it is definitely more like the older games. There is no arrow pointing you in the correct direction, or lengthy tutorial. It more or less throws you right into the action. There is a storyline along the way, which plays out in some very nice comic book-style cutscenes between levels and in-game dialogue via your radio. The cut scenes play while the game is loading, and you can skip them once the next level is done loading. You aren't forced to sit through them every time you play. One other thing about this is that the voice acting is pretty awful, even cringe-worthy at times. This is one of my main drawbacks and by far the worst part of the presentation, which, along with the graphic style, is otherwise one of the high points of the game.The game is still relatively linear but there are still some things left to figure out on your own. There are numerous secret areas and uncovering some of them can take some time. This is a nice touch that is missing from modern FPS games. One thing that is missing is quality puzzles. There just isn't much to speak of as far as puzzle solving goes. Aside from the secret areas, for the most part it never gets more complex than ""find and hit a switch"". That's not to say that's a bad thing, but it's missing that element of old school FPS games. The combat generally takes place in one of two settings: long narrow corridors with groups of enemies rushing at you from one end, and wider open areas where larger encounters take place. The enemies, which comprise of a variety of robots, tend come at you in waves, kind of like how Serious Sam works. Hard Reset doesn't throw nearly as many enemies at you though. There is a fair amount of enemies and each one tends to come in several varieties. Along with the game's 10 different weapon types, there is enough variety in the enemies and the ways to take them out that combat never becomes boring.There are multiple boss encounters along the way and they can be quite challenging. I played through it on the hard difficulty setting and most bosses I had to do multiple times. You can't just focus on the boss, as most of them spawn groups of the smaller enemies that kill you pretty quickly. The bosses typically have a glowing points that you have to blow up, so you have to pay attention and aim carefully (unless you acquire a certain weapon that will lock in and fire homing projectiles).You'll unlock multiple new weapons as well as upgrades to your health, armor and other attributes along the way. New weapons and upgrades are purchased spending at upgrade stations you find periodically throughout the levels. The game's currency, known as Nano, is earned by killing enemies and by finding it hidden in secret around the levels. I feel like a couple of the weapons and upgrades aren't very useful, and towards the end of the game you'll probably find yourself upgrading certain weapons or abilities just because you have upgrades to burn rather than because you need them. The new content unfortunately didn't add anything new to your arsenal. I feel like that's a wasted opportunity to add even just a few new upgrades. Overall I enjoyed my time with Hard Reset. I actually plan on going back and playing it again at some point down the road. That's rare for an FPS game. There is plenty to do, with multiple game modes and difficulties. There is also an achievement system if that's your thing. This is the best FPS game I've played since FEAR, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a better FPS to spend your money on.			"

												A great shooter by a Polish indie developer. Story is a throwaway, but its shooting bits are just plain fun. Its visuals are stunning and dont shy away when compared to AAA titles. The (amazing looking) cyberpunk setting can get a bit same-y after a while, but the free DLC ""Exile"" adds outdoor levels that just even better. Said DLC also prolongs the story and on a difficulty mode other than easy, the game can be very challenging. Given its a PC-only title, graphics options are aplenty, and you should be able to tailor it to your computer specs well. My concerns with HR originally was only the fact that its checkpoint-based, but you can now quicksave (with a .ini file edit, yes, but at least you can).			"

												This game is somehow clean and classic, in the way that I remember early FPS campaigns to be.  It's got a ridiculous hard-boiled cyborg protagonist and a simple character progression system that rewards light exploration.  The lighting is pretty slick; the writing acceptable if you're nostalgic for 90's cyberpunk absurdism.  I love it.  It plays well, and the length is about right.  Few games are so purely focused on the gaming experience - there was little wrapper, because little was needed.  It has all the comforts of a modern title (checkpoints, minor regen of ammo/health), with all the punishing action of the oldschool spazfests that kept me up in high school.  Buy it.			"

You get to buy a nice array of guns and upgrades and they really have a nice feel of power behind them.Enemy variety is extremely limited, but the campaign is short enough that it won't matter. The DLC is now included free and introduces a few new enemy types, another boss battle and extends the game by a couple of hours. I thought it was better than the original campaign, and easily wins best boss battle.Leaderboards, nice graphics with lots of settings, great gamepad support & over 100 Steam achievements.

												If you can look past the completely incomprehensible storyline and horrendous voice acting, there's an enjoyable game to be had here. The game looks, feels, sounds, and plays like something straight out of the Unreal franchise, especially Unreal Tournament 3, despite using a propriety engine (not UE3). In terms of gameplay, it's more along the lines of a Serious Sam game, eschewing cover, weapon reloading, and regenerating health for a more classic corridor shooter style. The gameplay can get extremely hectic once the waves of enemies start flowing -- this fun and frantic gamplay is Hard Reset's strong point, and is executed well.			"

												A great shooter by a Polish indie developer. Story is a throwaway, but its shooting bits are just plain fun. Its visuals are stunning and dont shy away when compared to AAA titles. The (amazing looking) cyberpunk setting can get a bit same-y after a while, but the free DLC ""Exile"" adds outdoor levels that just even better. Said DLC also prolongs the story and on a difficulty mode other than easy, the game can be very challenging. Given its a PC-only title, graphics options are aplenty, and you should be able to tailor it to your computer specs well. My concerns with HR originally was only the fact that its checkpoint-based, but you can now quicksave (with a .ini file edit, yes, but at least you can).			"

												This game is somehow clean and classic, in the way that I remember early FPS campaigns to be.  It's got a ridiculous hard-boiled cyborg protagonist and a simple character progression system that rewards light exploration.  The lighting is pretty slick; the writing acceptable if you're nostalgic for 90's cyberpunk absurdism.  I love it.  It plays well, and the length is about right.  Few games are so purely focused on the gaming experience - there was little wrapper, because little was needed.  It has all the comforts of a modern title (checkpoints, minor regen of ammo/health), with all the punishing action of the oldschool spazfests that kept me up in high school.  Buy it.			"

												Very strong and beautifully done game. One of the most nice FPS in a few years with nice shooting system and stuff. If the weapon switch system was more classic than Hard Reset would have become the continuer of Serius Sam legacy, but for a debut the team has made something very cool and they can make something even better (FREE addon has already shown it). So i expect to play next Wild Hog's game, really hope it will be shooter, hard, beautifull, fun and brutal shooter.9/10			"

												Really nice game with 10 weapons which you can buy and upgrade. A lot of different enemys. You must choose your tactic and weapons to win against hordes of ordinary enemys and powerful bosses. There is also nice story, hero and secrets to find. Its old-fashioned singleplayer shooter with first aid kits which is a bit unusual today but i like it. A lot of people say that its ""Too hard reset"" but i made this game on the highest difficulty level. Its hard but if you are stubborn you will make it. You should try it.                                                                                                                                                                MaxGregor			"

												Some highs but many lows. First off the level design is cool at first but all stages seem the exact same after a bit. You only fight robots and while some are inventine, it throws so many of the same at you in waves you get sick of them and want more variety. The weapons are underpowered and even on normal difficulty one robot takes more damage than you. It sends 10 guys at you at once and it takes 3 shotgun blasts to kill one. Do the math and you realized you have to restart many parts which makes it very annoying. Most of the upgrades don't help that much. The story is muddled and uninteresting told in comic book form. The graphics and physics are good as well as using the environment to get kills. I tried it on hard but the difficult is impossible and is more frustrating than fun so I switched to medium. I would give it a  6.5/10			"

												One ofthe worst fps games I've ever played.Great setting, cool combat, etc....love the destructible environment....but fails on so many basic design levels its disgusting.I don't understand how these people managed to make shadow warrior a decent game because it sure doesn't show for this game.1. God awful maneuvering, you can't quick jump/dash away from a charging enemy.  All you have is a sprint, so if you want to strafe quickly you need to turn and sprint to the left or right.2. The scenarios are generally garbage....There are tons of explosives everywhere you'd think at some point they would say ""Hey, maybe we should give our player some room to move around?"",  Nope...you are always finding yourself in crowded environments full of boxes, crates, pipes, indestructible fences, etc.I got to one boss fight so far....was the most cringeworthy thing I've seen. At no point in time do you EVER have never ending enemies spawning in an FPS.  Thats absolutely lazy design.3. Every battle scenario is accompanied by cutting off your escape route....no running back, pacing yourself, etc.4. At no point in the time does the game teach you what or how the guns are used. I still don't understand and I'm just guessing that you work off their armor with one gun, then plasma blast them...but consistency isn't easy to find.5. No crouch....seriously....they added jumping but no crouch.6. Invisible walls everywhere to the point where the enviroment is very misleading and causes you to waste tons of time trying to jump around on things.7. Minor complaint, but the story is awkward.  You are not properly introduced to anyone or anything, its like literally jumping into the middle of a book.8. Terrible hit and collision detection.  Those gorrilabot things will still hit you with their charge despite them never physcially colliding with you.I'll commend them on the cutscenes, the compromise on a regenerating shield instead of health, decent voice acting, graphics, and destructible environment, and even cool combat when the game isn't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on you...but the general battle scenarios suck.It gets very tiresome constantly being stuck in a crowded environment, with enemies swarming you because they seemingly pop out of nowhere.  If you are going to buy it, make sure you get it on sale.			"

												Hard Reset Exteneded Edition (otherwise known as the finished product) is a sci-fi first-person shooter developed by Flying Wild Hog; a team consisting of a few members who worked on Painkiller. This was their first published title and you can tell that some aspects of the game were experimental or not fleshed out as well as it could be. Gameplay : The primary focus of the game is its gunplay. The game revolves around a kinetic weapon and a energy weapon with each having five separate forms and each form having an alternate fire function. The kinetic weapon functions as a rifle, a shotgun, a grenade launcher, a rocket launcher, and a proximity mine deployer. The energy weapon functions as a rapid-fire pulse rifle, a close-range lightning arc, an EMP grenade launcher, a sniper rifle, and a homing weapon. The weapon models look great, but it can get confusing in-game knowing which weapon is in what mode which can lead to some unwanted splash damage. Enemy variety is sub-par up until the later levels, where it upgrades to servicable. Another problem is that the enemy models, all of them robots, don't stand out against the environment often enough. The health system involves a non-regenerating health bar which can be replenished with medkits (some enemies can drop small medkits upon their defeat) and a shield system that regenerates when you're not under fire. The game also boasts a light RPG element where you spend currency to upgrade your armaments as well as your combat suit. There are also environmental hazards littered throughout the levels which you can employ to take out enemies. The few bosses in the game are a delightful distraction from the masses of robots you destroy as you progress through the stages. On a sidenote, the in-game interface is cleverly done since everything in the game is mouse-driven. Overall, the gameplay can keep you engaged through completion.The story is easily the weakest part of the game, with voice actors phoning it in and the plot convulutes itself to a lackluster ending. The level design is cyberpunkish buildings through two-thirds of the game until it changes it up with a more varied environment at the final third. However, the design is also very linear with ""secrets"" that can be found by turning the other corner before going down the beaten path. Technically, the game runs smoothly with a benchmark inside the extras menu of the game.I would recommend picking this one up if you want a shooter that doesn't adhere to the modern military standard. At time of writing, the developers have made plans to release a Hard Reset Redux Edition which would upgrade the game engine to its latest version, add a melee weapon, spruce up enemy variety, and change the overall pace and balance. It's up to you if you want to plomp down some spare change to play this game now or wait it out until they release the Redux Edition.			"

												Mix Bladerunner with Quake 3 and you have Hard Reset. No multiplayer, no co-op option - just an out-and-out gun blazing FPS of killing multiple foes as quickly as possible.I very, very rarely say this - but Hard Reset is simply too difficult for its own good. The clue should be in the title - and that's when the game is set to Normal. Your arsenal of weapons is woefully underpowered (even, with upgrades too) and the opposing enemies are super-accurate - even over distance.FPS Gods will no doubt blitz through level after level without dying 4 or 5 times like I usually do. But for mainstream gamers - be warned. It will test the limits of your patience! :)That said, it is a good looking game and enjoyable too when you've had enough of online FPSs for a while.7/10			"

But it's pretty much the same thing, over and over and over; world/map design, level layout, too few variety of types of enemies, all react the same way ie. zerg spam spawn constantly, spawn/pop-out all around you, life, ammo, etc is all throwaway and goes down, then back up, with every encounter, making it seem not vaulable..Not recommended unless on sale and you love the genre, or if you're really in the mood for a truly 'mindless shooter,' which can sometimes be fun.If Steam had a ""Thumbs Sideways,"" that's what I'd give it.

Buyers remorse has never been so painful. - Bossfights are few and far between. - the story makes as much sense as the rantings of that conspiracy theorist you sat next to on the subway. - Characters are horribly developed.

												For guys craving a twitch shooter akin to Serious Sam and 3D versions of old school Duke Nukem and Shadow Warrior, this would be your jam. But for casual players looking to dabble in everything or just plain like shooters, there's so much wrong with it. There are no truly innovative ways to kill AI, some just soak up more bullets than others. I don't quite understand it. The story in itself is warped and beyond fixing. The characters are bland extrapolations of stereotypes in the countless games you've played before or movies you've seen. Objectives can be mundane and keep you confused as to what you're all really playing this game for aside from its stellar level and weapon upgrade design. It also relies on the gimmick of red barrels, which wears off after the first 2 levels. They fixed some of the issues (a CQC weapon & dodge mechanics) in the redux, and I would recommend that if you haven't gotten the Redux yet. Is it worth it after you upgrade it? No. The core gameplay and mechanics will be just as boring the first time you played it. You just get to dodge charges and get a sword that's only useful on Easy difficulty. It doesn't have a skill tree, so it feels like they just threw it in there. That, and the graphics look identical to its 2011 counterpark. Total cash grab.			"

												Here's the problem with Hard Reset, plain and simple.  Is it hard?  Yep.  Is it a good or a fun hard?  No, it's really not.  It's cheap as all get out, and that's really not that much fun if you're into this kind of game.  Even if you're not it's not gonna be a bundle of joy.  Yeah, I know there's lots of reviews gushing over it - only conclusion I can come to is we have either a lot of people that are masochists or haven't played that much of it.1.  Cheap hitscan nonsense:  Yep, when they said oldschool they meant hitscan crap.  I.E. they're gonna shoot your♥♥♥♥♥♥off, and you can do nothing about it.  If they can remotely see you, they can hit you.  If they can't see you, they can still hit your half the time with homing missiles.  Dodging?  Lol no - it fires you get shredded, sorry man you shoulda taken cover!  Oh wait, there pretty much isn't any that works worth a damn as all the arenas are tiny and all the robots are 27 times faster than you are.  Awesome!2.  Does there really need to be a 2?  'Cause 1 made me TRY to refund this long ago, and get refused on it.  And yes, I played a good pile of hours on it trying to gut through.  Until I realized it wasn't fun - and it hadn't been since about the first half hour.  Oh... have I mentioned no saves, and some of the stupidest places for checkpoints I've ever seen?  Beyond awful placement.  Be prepared to redo ages of fighting, hope you enjoy that - cause it will happen - all the time.  Don't care if it can be hacked to be saved, that just means you can put a bandaid on their god-awful game design.  Yeah, great.3.  Seriously, this is just plain stacking unfair game advantage on you to simulate difficulty.  Difficulty is not giving the player junk tools and enemies that make the player feel about as effective as a toddler with a pellet gun.  Guns don't hit worth a darn, enemies will soak vast amounts of your ammo store barring specific guns.  This game is a good idea that either they got lazy on or just couldn't test with non-""I am leetzor I WILL PUT UP WITH ANY NONSENSE TO PROVE HOW BIG MY DIGITAL REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS ARE RRARR!"" people. 4.  Before the usual ""Git gud scrub"" crowd starts in, games I do like and handle just fine are things like Serious Sam.  I tend to play my shooters on hard - and I've been playing this kind of thing since Doom.  But back in those days we had hitscan because it was all the tech could handle, and monsters and placement were carefully balanced to account for this.  In this case... not even close.  Not even a handwaved attempt at getting close.  Just ""We're gonna overwhelm you with stuff everywhere that is stronger than anything you could ever manage, roflcopterbbq. ""   This is a failed attempt at reproducing oldschool unless you want oldschool complete with all the bad elements the tech difference required added to a complete lack of care in level design beyond ""Swarm them with stuff.  No, 10X the stuff with 50X the hitpoints.  That'll teach 'em!""5.  Unfortunately, the problems with this game remind unpleasantly of Fear 3 - another shooter I refunded pretty quickly for many of the same reasons.  Hitscan, unfair numbers and placements, bulletsoaking enemies beyond the point of laughability even, and a near complete lack of level design - replaced with sheer overpowered enemies and numbers of mobs well beyond any sense of fun.  Sorry about the length of this, but the level of disappointment here was vast - this coulda been interesting.  Instead, once you get past the shiny at the start you've pretty much got a travesty.  This just digs up oldschool's corpse, sticks a party hat on it, and poses it for some Weekend At Bernie's style action.*If the language in this review sounds like Ned Flanders getting irked at a game, blame the Steam censoring.  I've learned to type that way on here so my reviews don't become incomprehensible strings of hearts seperating the occaisonal and or the.  ;p			"

												I honestly can't get into this game. Maybe I spent my nano on the wrong upgrades, maybe I'm just too old for frantic action, but it's just not working for me. I'd probably kick major butt fifteen years ago, but y'know, middle age and FPS don't go so well together.The main weapon - the assault rifle - might as well be shooting paper bullets, even upgraded with faster RoF. The shotgun seemed quite useless, and I stopped using the grenade launcher the moment I realized the grenade actually takes several seconds to explode. What I was aiming at was no longer there. The reload time is huge, so you can't even spam grenades for some carnage.I went for the mortar on the energy weapon, and while that did work on swarms of tiny robots, I have no idea if it's capable of doing ANY damage to bigger robots. It sure doesn't feel like it. I probably damaged myself more with it than I damaged them.There's probably a combination of weapons needed for certain enemy types. Like, shoot this with that weapon, use the other one upgraded to something to kill that thing, and then use a different upgrade for other weapon to do this and then finish the enemy off with that. This and that, here and there, it just didn't click with me. The weapons in general seem to lack ""oomph"". Note that I haven't played the game for a long amount of time, so maybe it gets better later.As far as level design is concerned, this is a linear corridor shooter, which isn't a bad thing by itself, but since there's lots of environmental debris and objects, I found myself getting stuck on things and quickly cornered. Since the enemies are very powerful even at the start, that means immediate death and then reloading from the checkpoint.Some things are very much rigged, and not in a good way; for example, you go down to a small room to pick up some nano, and then you get a swarm of robots spawning behind you.

Rinse and repeat.Then you enter a parking garage and die to another swarm of tiny robots.You reload, do the same thing again and again, kill everything, and suddenly you're swarmed by MEDIUM robots which the energy mortar won't do anything to, and everywhere you turn, you get stuck on a parked car and can't escape. Therefore, you die again, quit the game, go to Steam to write this review, uninstall the game and move it to a ""Done"" category in your Steam library.			"

												if you are an oldschool fps lover of duke nukem 3d, doom, and shadow warrior and you were told this game harkened back to that era, then you were lied to.if you are a regular fps fan of the modern era, then go ahead and buy this game, its still better then what we get nowadays but still you are better off buying duke nukem 3d or shadow warrior or the original doom/2the problem is they just dont know how to build levels anymore. if you have to make your level with a feature that prevents backtracking (like a ledge you cant climb back up).....then your doing it wrong. If you have to make an arena that locks the player into it until all the monsters are dead.....then your doing it wrong. If i have to look up a guide abouty our game because i am lost in the level and I cant even tell where the player is in the guide becasue everything looks EXACTLY THE SAME COLOR GREY.....then you did it wrong.i feel so disenfranchised as an old school fps fan lately =(			"

												This is pretty decent for a obscure FPS game. It is pretty innovative. Your two weapons do everything. When you switch weapons, it spins and uses a different attachment and is pretty cool. The energy weapons though are the highlight of the game: put your upgrades into them for the most fun. It has some crazy awesome weapons but only a few enemy types and the graphics are really kick♥♥♥♥♥awesome. It has some of the best effects I've seen in a game, although not coded perfectly so there is some slowdown sometimes with some effects but it is not that bad if you have a powerful gpu. It also provides a good challenge compared to most other fps games. Pick this up for some solid fun if you dig FPS games that break away from the norm and do it well. 7.5/10			"

												Meh at best, this frustrating game has some really bad AI and shallow game play. You fight the same mobs on every level. That would have been OK if the AI was anything more then run at you and run at you some more. To compensate for the lack of AI they throw a ton of them at you or drop them in right behind you. Both get old rather quick.The story is OK but nothing to rave about.Ok if you can get it for $5 or less.------Just finished the game and what a let down. The final boss wa really easy, it was a lot harder getting to the boss then fighting it. They have a half decent story and just leave it hanging. Don't answer any of the questions presented. Feels like they ran out of money. I really wish I could return this game...			"

												The cutscenes are great, animated comic book things, and if a rather punishing FPS game is what you want, then this is for you. But for me, I felt it was incredibly linear and combat just doesn't feel rewarding - the guns just don't feel like they're that effective. On top of that, the storyline is just kind of crammed at you during the cutscenes, and there's not a bit of character or story in the actual levels themselves.If you're gonna buy/play this, make sure you don't pay full price for it, it just doesn't feel like it's worth it.

This game is really good technically.  But is it actually fun to play?It looks great, controls easily, and runs super-smoth.  This game reminds me a lot of Serious Sam packed into Doom 3 levels.  If that sounds like fun, go for it.  For me, an hour was about the extent of my enjoyment before it just felt like more and more of the same.So do I recommend the game?  If you like this genre, I think it's really well made.  However, I felt like I had pretty much seen what the game had to offer after about an hour.  The levels are uninteresting.  The hordes of robots were boring.  It had none of the horror of Doom 3 but certainly the drab.  I don't think I am going to recommend this game, but it's not a bad offering for the genre.			"

												Overall 7/10. It's a fun game, if a little difficult at times, and rather repetitive. Seems like a futuristic Serious Sam game to me. The graphics are gorgeous, and the gameplay is fast and frantic, but there's no duck or quick-save, and the beginning weapons are thoroughly useless by the end of the game, so don't waste upgrade pods on them. Environmental kills are fun, but not implemented very well. Campaign is 5ish hours total, and there is no multiplayer, so I'm glad I got it on sale.If you like your shooters fast-paced and frantic, give it a try. It's made by a new game studio, so I'm happy to support them. They will go far.			"

In any case, try out the demo if you're interested.			"

												Has a really nice game engine (presumably an advanced version of this was used to better effect in the later Shadow Warrior remake) but this game is dull, with enemies that blend in too much with the gunmetal grey / blue scenery. The plot (such as it is) is badly translated to the point of being incomprehensible and it's far too repetative in general.That said, the DLC chapters (the last five or so maps) improve significantly with more interesting environments but you'll struggle not to get bored before reaching them.Also, Technically I never managed to complete it, because beating the final boss caused my game to CTD every time. Not great.I'd avoid and instead maybe take a look at the developers more recent game, Shadow Warrior, which is a lot more interesting.Two C-beams glittering in the dark near Tanhauser Gate out of five.

												Red barrels - the videogame.Eh... I picked it up for 2 euros, so I can recommend it at the pricetag, but honestly, compared to Shadow Warrior (2013) this game is not very good for the most part.Especially if you get the wrong upgrades. Some weapons are useless even after you get the upgrades (looking at you, assault rifle). It wasn't until I painfully played through half the game when I realized, that the way to go here is to permastun enemies. Get all the CC upgrades, use RPG and railgun for dealing big damage, shotgun for wave clearing.There's not a lot of enemy variety either. You got the little annoying ones, you've got the big charging ones, the rocket spammers and the scarabs. They do have a varied look based on how much armor they are packing, but at the end of the day they have the same abilities with a different paintjob.The enemies are bullet sponges as well. UNLESS, you use the red barrels to kill them. The game puts a lot of emphasis on that, rather than the gunplay, which is a shame. 1-2 red barrels can kill the bigges enemies, but if you try to do the same with your guns, it will take a long while. There are plenty of red barrels in the first few chapters, but later they get more scarce and therefore the fights are needlessly prolonged, because you are waiting for the day the spongy enemies will finally die.I also noticed a lot of inconsistency in this game. Sometimes the little sawblade enemies deal only like 20 damage, sometimes up to 80. I have no idea wtf going on whatsoever. Is it because of my shield? But even if my shield are full, I still lose HP when I'm hit. Is it proportional? Is the damage only halved? Are shields only protecting from ranged attacks? I have no idea what's going on.This game does one thing pretty damn well though, and that's the boss fights. The boss fights with Atlas and the Overseer from the Exile DLC are particularly well done. I really liked how I had to get the Overseer to suck in the barrels. That was a bit creative and unusual. Really good boss fight, that one. The parts of the game between the boss fights are really not enjoyable though.In conclusion you can very much tell that this is the studios 1st game. It was an experiment. I'd say play Shadow Warrior instead, if you haven't played already. That's a much much more polished version of all the ideas this game experimented with and therefore a thoroughly enjoyable game. Get this game only at a huge discount and only if you are very bored.			"

Originally, i didn't like Hard Reset, and stopped after less than an hour.I didn't understand why there were only two weapons, nor why there was a separate command to select each. I didn't understand why i was moving from area to area, killing hordes of robots and i didn't understand why i was so bad at it...For the next few months, Hard Reset sat in my games list, with just 1 achievement, mocking me.Recently, I’ve been aiming for perfect games (a 100% achievement score), trying to increase my average completion rate. So with only one achievement, the time came back around to re-install Hard Reset, and try to bump my rating back up.After it was re-installed, i had the option to continue my last save, so i clicked the resume button, and in i went. Still on the first level, i continued my desperate struggle against the machines, and again, trying to make sense of the area to area robot horde killing gameplay.This is probably the point that changed the game for me. My next challenge was to fight one of the bigger robots (the kind that charges at you), and i hadn’t realised that i was being awarded points for destroying the enemies, as well as collecting the orange pickups. “A new upgrade is available” flashed on the screen, and having already seen an upgrade terminal, i quickly found the next one. I took a grenade launcher on the CLG Firearm.The controls need explaining. It’s Q to select the CLG Firearm and E to select the NRG Weapon, after you add a new function to each one, you’ll be able to select that function with a number, so for example, i would have the CLG firearm selected with Q, then to select the normal machine gun mode, you would press 1, the shotgun function would be 2, and for my newly acquired grenade launcher, i would have to press 3.Now i had an incentive to carry on. To become more powerful, i would have to continue, and the achievements had already started popping up in the corner. Then, i think i started to like Hard Reset, i was looking forward to getting past the next section, getting my next upgrade, and finding all of those delicious secrets.Currently, i’m playing it through on hard mode, which involves many re-tries. Every section is a case of trial and error. You go in, get horded, die, then retry, positioning yourself in a better place, to get past the first spawn. The second and third hordes of the area, will no doubt kill you again and again. Forcing you to retry, each time, remembering where the enemies come from, and to be ready, bottlenecking them with the scenery, and using the environment to your advantage.Hard Reset would probably describe itself as an environmental shooter, as half of the scenery is either explosive, or has electronics wired so badly that a light kick would force it to short out and electrocute everything in a 2 metre radius.So, my advice would be, to sit it out, play the first level to the end, try not to give up immediately. I understand now, why there are only two weapons, and generally how the game is compiled together giving the player individual challenges, and i understand why i struggled at first.The only thing i don’t understand now, is why i like this game so much.

												Pretty good FPS! Old-school in the sense of Painkiller and Serious Sam, rather than DOOM and DukeNukem.The level design isn't as interesting as the latter, but the game still has room for a few secrets for you to uncover. Each weapon is unique, with various uses, although the slow upgrade system doesn't encourage experimentation with the weapons (it's balanced for you to have 80-85% of the upgrades by the end of the game).Still, even though it may take a while, each weapon is pretty satisfying. Wave uponh wave of enemies. The big problem is how resilient they are to damage. Even a rocket launcher is rather inneffective... Then again, I played on Hard mode. It's... really hard. Sometimes frustrating, putting high damage enemies with you into very small spaces. But, despite that big flaw, the game is still a hell of a lot of fun!Visually, it's nothing short of impressive, with a huge, cyberpunk city. The lighting system is pretty good as well.Then, there's the physic's system. It's a big part of what makes this game awesome to play! Everything explodes and breaks apart, and you can basically shoot everything long after they're dead. It gets a bit too resource intensive, but it's worth it.The levels are a bit too long to my taste (usually 40minutes +), seeing how much you die. Checkpoints are really unforgiving as well, with the game lacking a ""quicksave"" feature.But hey, if you're looking for a game that is purely about the shooting, with little other distractions, definitely check this out!

Sure the sci-fi bladerunner-esque settings look gorgeous and the guns are a lot of fun to use, but the game gets very repetitive as you fight the same enemies over and over again (robots) and the story is confusing.

It is just very generic FPS game.  It offers nothing new or original.   The first big fight they throw at you is just waves of bots and followed by a few waves of bigger bots.  If these bots hit you, they take your shields down and hurt you somehwat (from a single hit).  The solution is obvious:  Stand on a car and just shoot the hell out of them.

												I like this game. It looks great, sounds good, has a great atmosphere, and it's fun to blow up robots.But I don't recommend it, because it's hampered by a bunch of bad design decisions. There are lots of ""Gotcha!"" moments where enemies will spawn behind you, or you'll get locked into a closed space with a bunch of buzzsaw-bots. The checkpoints are way too far apart in places, and the game won't let you save without them.At first glance, this seems like a classic-style twitch shooter, but it's actually more about cycling through the cooldowns on your weapons efficiently and keeping dangerous enemies stun-locked while you whittle down their huge health pools. Your character doesn't dodge very quickly, and the environments have a ton of junk to get caught up on, which is frustrating.If you have a high tolerance for frustration, this game is worth your time.

												The mechanics and graphics of the game are solid, with the 2 weapon upgrade system especially notable. However, this game often fails to let you go where you want to go, with no jumping while sprinting, and randomly placed invisible walls preventing you from deviating from the desired path, including to some secrets where you have to progress further before you're meant to come backtrack and then find them on that walk through. It also is unnecessarily punishing, with trips into dead ends for secrets (upgrade points) spawning waves from nowhere that mob the culdesac, with doors randomly locking behind you with a wave bearing down so you have nowhere to hide, and sometimes with enemies spawning in areas with no cover so you just have to pray your way through.I was playing on the hardest setting, so my fragility was probably enhanced, but little to no cover in some areas and the inability to jump things that you should be able to jump over, just ruined the game for me.

												Ooh Hard Reset, how I love you. This game is great. Follows a semi-oldschool formula for level design and health managment. Difficulty is great, you can and will die.Graphics are beautiful, controls/settings are all good. Not everybody will be able to deal with actually dying in a FPS singleplayer nowadays but that's kinda why stuff like this has to exist. To remind us that you actually need to know how to play and understand you need to be efficient. Not every game needs to hold your♥♥♥♥♥♥into every fight.The only gripes I have for this game are some of the weapon upgrades are kinda bad (not worthless) compared to others and there are too few enemies. The same problem with flying wild hog's other game Shadow Warrior. They need to make about 5-10 more enemy types each game to avoid it getting repetitive. But the DLC area adds a few, and some amazingly pretty levels.8.5(+1/-1)/10 Must-play if you like real PC FPS games.			"

												Just awesome!! I hated FPS's for the longest time; mostly this was due to me being a console gamer by whole life and I never understood the draw. But, Far Cry 3 changed all that for me and now its my favorite catergory. Hard Reset has only helped strengthen my opinion of the genre. The gameplay is so smooth that it is virtually flawless. If every FPS used Hard Reset's formula there would never be another bad FPS again. It also sets a very high bar for the game's developers. They now have to always make soemthing a little better than this. And I have to say that I wouldn't be surprised if they found that extremely challenging. I purchased the game on sale for 4.99 and I played it immediately (as opposed to the 5-6 games on Steam I have not yet played that I owned before this). I was blown away from the start. The only part of this game that is just ok are the cut-scenes' voice acting. The cutscenes animation is nice and stays true to the abstractness  and sci-fi feel of the story, but the writing and the voices could be better. However, you can skip the cutscenes after a sceond or two; the next levels/scenes load very fast!			"

												Incredibly great game, still don't know why it is so unknown. But think it may be these reasons:-The movement feels awkward.-The combat feels awkward.-Enemies have way more health than they should.-My guns doesn't feel powerful, i feel like i am using techno-peashooters.-The upgrade menu is counter intuitive, yes if you read carefully no mistakes are made, but you need to mouse over each item to show all information. (i spent half of the game using default ""weapon mode"" just upgrading ""armor/ammo"" before realizing that the first of each upgrade area were the actual weapons, i thought the ""weapon mode"" were going to be unlocked at some point, not manually)-Explosive attacks goes through walls, I seriously kept dying by enemy missiles BEHIND COVER.-Still have no idea what the ♥♥♥♥ i am fighting against. (Edit3: Robots i guess? characters just kept talking about external internal AI and technobabble)-Ambience noises that tear my auditory system apart. When these ambience sounds start i take my headphone off for a moment. (edit: these appear to be level specific)-When i was about to complain that enemies have too much health and weapons are weak, i got the energy area of effect gun and it is op, it stuns? or slows small enemies and then explode in an area, upgrade with ammo regen and you are op as hell. (edit: it still op as hell if enemies are all coming after you in a single corridor)-Besides these points the game is actually really great. I'm actually enjoying it so far.Edit1:I just beat the first boss, more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t unavoidable explosives, i just beat him because the xray gun told me the target to shoot.-I forgot to mention, the graphics are Sanctum 2 level of quality and polish, very beaultiful game.-It also has a comic book style of storytelling while loading like Sanctum 2. But this one is animated and voice acted.Edit2:-Also forgot to mention, the level design is mixed, seems good, but every enemy encounter follows this:1: Arrive in an area.2: The passage is closed behind you. cannot retreat.3: Enemies overwhelm you, just a clusterf uck from everywhere.4: If you manage to survive, collect loot and advance level.Goto 1 (AKA rinse and repeat)Edit3: I just beaten the game.-It is actually very well polished. lots of props plants and debris around.-Lots of detail everywhere. Very beautiful overall.-Very atmospheric.-Just the movement, combat and enemy that are awkward and feel unpolished.-The last boss was interesting and lame at the same time, i think my strategy was too good for it.-I am not even gonna try another playthrough, i can already predict that higher difficulty is the same but with less pickups and/or more enemy health.I'm talking bad about this game but i feel it is worth playing it.

												8/10Holy Crap this  is prolly the most action packed game I've ever played in my life. It's also a complete breath of fresh air for it reminds me of the good ol' days of first person shooters. Complete balls to the wall action , in your face,, tongue waging . bullet fueled Blood Fest.(ok there are no humans to kill only robots but you get the picture. I truly did enjoy this game. The Pros:Visuals: The game looks fantastic , awesome cyberpunk settingGameplay: God Damn is this game fun to play. Its incredibly relentless in its face melting greatness. Seriously it's like the most intense game I've played in forever . A++++++. Upgrades: you only have 2 weapons, you can upgrade the snot out of them . You want a rifle that can be upgraded to ihave shotgun/ rocket launcher/ seeker missile/ grenade launcher enhancements? well by all means sir help your self! Once this aspect comes into play, you'll find yourself using different techniques in battle by switching between these enhancements to your advantage. the price: at its full price of 15 dollars on steam it is VERY worth it, i can't say that often but in this case it is.Giant Bosses: Its to see a game where a boss can be 200 feet tall and make your jaw dropTHe Cons:Story: Now mind you, the story is not bad by any means, it just kind of gets loss in all the mayhemMusic: its kind of silly at times, but even so it makes obliterating waves of robots kind of funnyIn Conclusion, this game rocks and deserves your attention if you like playing videogames. Even the negative aspects i pointed out are very minor and can still be enjoyed to some extent. I Enjoyed my time in Hard Reset, and i know you will too.   "

												A fairly enjoyable game. I'm not a fan of old school fps gameplay, but this game refreshes the genre very well. There's enough originality to keep you interested despite the weak story and lack of ""human"" AI.The game looks beautiful and the effects and weapon customisation make it more immersive than your typical old school shooter. The graphic novel cutscenes are really well made and remind me of the MGS Digital Graphic Novel. The weakest point of the game is the story (which isn't explained very well), but the gameplay makes it worth the while.			"

												Very pretty, but lacks in the gameplay department. Still worth it if you get it cheap.Overall the combat doesn't feel very meaty. Rockets are super slow, you can only sprint for 3 seconds. Feels sluggish.The game doesn't allow a lot of freedom. It's mostly going down a corridor and then from arena to arena. Little variety. Often it seems that you can jump over obstacles, but they put invisible walls everywhere			"

												A fun, short little old school style FPS with real fast shooting and circle strafing, made by the same guys who made Shadow Warrior 2013. May not be the most polished or fancy game on the market, but still worth your time. The weapons are all varied and fun to use, and come with upgradeable characteristics that you can use to specialize your arsenal.The storyline is also surprisingly interesting, although it won't win any awards. Graphics are beautiful and the world is a mish mash of every single cyberpunk world you can think of. However, my main complaint is that the game doesn't have a HUGE amount of enemy variety and the level design can feel kinda boring and stale at times. However, this game is often on sale really cheap and totally worth it! I play it to warm my fingers up before CS.			"

												Excellent value for money on a sale! The story does end abruptly (even with the exile DLC), so here's hoping a sequel comes along.It starts off in a similar vein to Painkiller - waves of mobs, and you just have to mow them down. But it quickly morphs into a pretty decent sci-fi shoorter. Great cyberpunk atmosphere, gorgeous textures, and a somewhat interesting story (at least, it's better than Painkiller's excuse of a story...).It's a pity it ends as it does, but it's still a solid 5-10 hours of great FPS fun.Note that the exile DLC is just added on to the main campaign - so you won't realise you're playing the DLC. I was confused and thought there would be a seperate menu option to start the DLC, but no, it just seamlessly continues on from the main story. "

												It always feels good when PC gets an exclusive game. Such is the case with Hard Reset.A sci-fi first-person shooter that brings back the hardcore gameplay of games from the 90's. Your health does not regenerate.You should probably pick up health and shield supply. Like all the time.There is no zooming really, but THERE IS NO TIME TO ZOOM.Robots! Alien Robots! There are two main weapons but they have a pretty in-depth upgrading system to keep killing fresh.Short campaign, but the DLC comes free with purchase - can't go wrong with that.8.5/10 - Highly recommended for PC gamers.

												My expectations were pretty low when I bought this last month. Why did I buy it anyway ? I don't know why, I guess it's because of my love for games. Anyway, the game didn't disappoint. Not entirely, that is. First the good stuff; the graphics are of extremely high quality, especially for a downloadable game. I'm sorry to say, though, that there are the occasional framedrops during hectic firefights and explosions. The shooting works like a shooter should (see what I did there ?). Enemies come from all directions so you have to be careful at all times. The weapons and the upgrades are cool as well. The energy weapon I haven't used during the entire game, which is, by the way, about 3,5 hours long, so in my opinion they should've removed it. The controls are fine and the sounds are excellent, but the voice acting and story were weak. And the game ended when I actually thought I was about halfway, which is a shame. Worth the full price ? Nope. Wait for a 50% price drop.[Rating: 78/100]			"

												Hard Reset is an FPS in the vein of the genesis of FPS. Combat is quick and based around movement and lots of guns rather than cover and patience.Unfortunately it feels a bit clunky, you have a jump but it's basically useless and there is no crouch. Sprinting is fairly limited and the screen distorts so much you can't really see anything, leading you to often rush headlong into enemies. As expected you can unlock a plethora of weapons to help you along the way. There are 10 guns in total, each with an alternate fire. The weapons are split into two classes, one firing physical ammo the other firing energy. While I didn't use a number of the weapons or firing modes it was enjoyable to work out the best gun/mode combos for each enemy type. The weapons feel decent and some are pretty fun to use, but the swap time is agonizingly slow.The level design is that of a corridor shooter but the fact that it is essentially linear is a bit of departure from the days of yore. There are plenty of secrets tucked into corners or behind destructible walls but it's not like you'll be exploring vast open levels to find them. The world is heavily cyberpunk and takes place almost entirely at night in the rain. It looks pretty good for what I suspect is a pretty minimal budget. It's an interesting world that is severely undersold by the story. Mostly told between levels by clunky animated, poorly voice acted ""cut scenes"" done in a graphic novel style, the story is underdeveloped and poorly explained. I wanted to to care about the story and the world but I just couldn't get drawn in. It just feels like there was supposed to be so much more.The included DLC, Exile (previously Path to Exile or Extended Edition) is essentially more if the same. There are a couple new enemy types but one of the guns completely removes them as a threat. Partly through Exile I realized I was just grinding and going through the paces.In the end Hard Reset is just a bit shallow. The potential is there for a much more engaging experience but it just doesn't deliver. If you're a fan of circle strafing this is probably a must have but for generalists or people looking for a deeper cyberpunk world this is a bargain bin/bundle pick up.

Too much 5 minute bullet time events present in game these days and 12 quick-time events for the devs to take you by the hand and finish the game for you while you duck behind chest-high walls 90% of the time...Cons- SOundtrack could have been better. It's quite poor actually. Jesper Kyd should have been hired for this (he also did MDK2 soundtrack, HItman, Assassin's Creed) ; heck , even I am into music production and I have some unreleased♥♥♥♥♥♥better than what's in this one's soundtrack.- enemies need more variety - 90% of them come towards you for melee; few ranged ones.- too much motion blur (i hate it) when sprinting + FOV to +200 while doing so is ridiculous....

												An excellent straight-up FPS.  It has a pretty unique style, with a little bit of Painkiller mixed in.  Very skill-based and quite fun once you get used to the game mechanics.  I started out trying to play like Painkiller and that does NOT work.  Rather that using movement speed to fight enemies, the game is designed around using environmental obstacles and objects to destroy them.  And now there's a free bonus campaign!  Highly recommended, especially for the price.			"

												A shockingly underrated game. A good throwback to the golden age of shooters, hard reset is an amazing cyberpunk adventure. While it falls short with the story, which is confined to animated cutscenes, and very confusing, the game really shines with its mass amount of enemies running at you, and the carnage that follows. the 2 weapons with multiple firing modes is a interesting concept. Early in the game this will be a problem due to the lack of variety, but later on you will be blazing through with laser guided rockets and x-ray railguns galore			"

												A very fun game with many of the FPS tropes like being in an empty room, hit the objective, and suddenly a fight for your life. Environmental kills abound since the level designers use them as props as well.You have 2 main weapons, a bullet-gun, and an energy-gun. You can upgrade them to have up to 5 ""modes"" with each mode having an alternate ability. I only used the energy gun twice when the bullet gun ran out of ammo, so I can't say how it works fully.The bullet gun has a machine gun mode (alternate zoom), shotgun mode (alternate EMG mini-grenades that stun whatever they hit), grenade launcher (alternate gravity well that sucks enemies in and traps them in a small space), RPG (alternate laser guided), and proximity mine (alternate manual detonation).The ammo system is a shared pool, in that all of the bullet gun modes use bullet ammo, just in varying quantities based on the strength of the mode. RPG using the most and machine gun using the least. So no running around for machine gun ammo when you have 40 grenades lying around.You start with just the machine gun mode on the bullet gun mode, and the default energy gun mode, and collect orange upgrade packs lying around called 'N.A.N.O.' which come in large or small sizes. Once you have enough of them, you can upgrade your gun for an additional mode, add an alternate fire, or pimp the primary fire out more. Small N.A.N.O. packs are all over the place and are like a trail of breadcrumbs in some otherwise hard to navigate areas. The larger N.A.N.O. packs are usually hidden behind crates, breakable walls, or areas you have to parkour to.There are some really OP combinations with the guns, like using the gravity grenade to hold trash mobs together in a bottleneck, then kill all of them with one grenade. Because the explosion from the grenade breaks the gravity well, for a larger charging mob, you hold them with the gravity grenade, then hit them with an RPG for a one-hit-kill. I would recommend getting the shotgun, grenade launcher, grenade alternate fire, RPG, then the laser guided alternate. Towards the end of the game you will pretty much need the RPG to take out some really annoying flying mobs. Proximity mines are fairly lackluster and use ~40 of your maximum 240 ammo for one proximity mine.As for the story, it uses a graphic novel format between levels, with basically no story told during gunplay. The ending doesn't really feel like one. Kinda like the ending to Half-Life 2: Episode 2, the devs called it an ending, but they player is left wanting more.All in all, it's a fun game if you just wanna shoot a bunch of robots in a future dystopia setting.

												Woefully underrated, Hard Reset could be considered a cyberpunk version of Painkiller. While not as fluid as Painkiller, the combat in HR is still enjoyable. Environmental kills are plentiful, the enemies have unique visual styles, the graphics are pretty, and the weapons are fairly cool.The story is forgettable; I've played through HR twice and still don't know what it was about. Which is fine because the combat is what kept me entertained. The levels are confusing at times, and the art style sometimes obscures the route forward. But, at the same time the art style is pretty enough that taking time to check stuff out can be a nice break from the combat.Overall, Hard Reset is great for people who enjoy run and gun action, but may not appeal to many others. It can seem difficult at times, but if you're resourceful, you'll usually find a way to use the environment to your advantage.			"

												This game is so bad...It tries to copy Serious Sam but in a totally BAD and annoying way. It wants you to shoot 50K enemies per level, but all of the fights/encounters lack the fun element thats been replaced by the annyoing element. Once the fighting starts, you dont really understand much thats going on on the screen, as it immediatelly fills up with a gazillion effects that would normaly add to a game, but in this case, its WAY too much and that is causing the exact opposite effect. It also almost forces you to use the environment to kill off the hordes of enemies, but because of a lack of imagination, its counter- productive and intuitive. They tried to fill it up with everything that was good in other shooters, but ended up with a bad stew. You cant just take all the good things from other shooters (or whatever other genre) and throw them together into your game, thinking its gonna be perfect. All those elements need to have a certain sinergy and that sinergy is influenced by the creative mind of the developer where he uses various bridges to link those elements together.I could go on for another half an hour about why this game is bad, but its one of those things that no matter how many of the flaws you mention, they are just to many to overlook or to fix thru patches or DLCs.The only nice thing about the game is the graphics... but as Indie games have proven time and time again, you dont need Crysis/Battlefield/CoD/etc type of graphics to build an encredibly fun game.

												Edit: Also, there's a Redux out now that apparently fixes basically every issue I had with this game aside from the attempt at a story, so you should really just get that instead.The game looks great, has a neat concept with the evolving guns, and the core gameplay is doom/quake/sam style arena/horde shooting on a solid engine. However, this is all hampered by a slew of bad level design, especially since, despite having evolving guns that often leave you geared for specific approaches depending on how you build them up, many areas are built around a specific approach that you may have no real way of accomplishing (The most notable coming to mind being that you can gear yourself specifically for a run-up-and-blast-em sort of approach, only for one level to consist entirely of enemies on unreachable platforms 100-200 feet away.)Likewise, enemies dip far too into the bullet sponge variety. The game is also incredibly short, barely 5 hours even with the expansion, and rather than going the smart route of ""Here's an opening cutscene briefly setting up a premise, now go shoot things."", there's a story that barely makes any sense scattered across cutscenes throughout the game that only serves to unnecessarily break the action.

												Hard Reset is a laudable independent attempt at capturing the feel of classic-inspired ""horde"" first person shooters like Painkiller and Serious Sam. The early sensations are great, with a lush-looking Blade-Runner inspired aesthetic and a combat based on detonating strategically placed environmental hazards that will help you stop the hordes of robots running in your direction.Unfortunately, that initial interest doesn´t last much longer. The gameplay turns up extremely shallow and repetitive by the third level, with the same hazards, enemies and pacing (get stuck in arena, kill all enemies, walk until next arena) over and over until the end of the game. The storytelling is dull, the extremely noisy and constrasty visuals full of flashing lights make almost impossible to realize what's happening on screen during the chaotic battles, so you just shoot randomly at moving things. There is barely anything during the game that will surprise you, so whereas the controls are comfortable and the game feels quite polished, the experience will be the exact same from the first to the last minute. ""Hard Reset"" is a clear example of a one-trick-pony of a game.I'd recommend you to play the demo, but I wouldn't spend any money on the full game, since the game deflates almost since the beginning. A somewhat short game that will feel like takes too long to end out of the sheer repetition you'll feel along the journey.			"

To the people that say they spent most of the time ""running backwards and shooting"" ... seriously??  Do you not have any clue about tactics?  Lure the creatures into a narrow tunnel and blast them with the shotgun.  Is this game perfect? .. no .. far from it.  Switching between guns and energy weapons is ridiculous.  Weapons aren't great, but they are fun.  Bougtht this game during the steam sale .. and have no regrets.  I wish there was co-op multiplayer and better weapons.

												Another review for another half game.  little backstory: a few members of People can fly who made the asteemed Painkiller are part of the Flying Hog Wild staff. That  said it shows. this game is really uninspired. The enviroment is the only thing that gives this game a plus. the Story is decent but its extremely shortand feels half done. the Script and VO work is awful but represents the cut scenes perfectly, like a bad  action comic from the eraly 90's if youve watched any animations from hte early 90's you know what im talking about. The action is alright but seems a bit forced, in each wave you have a single chance of getting things right or else you're dead. the weapons feel underpowered in some situations and adequate in others. I bought this soley on the demo and the relation to PK, PCF, but this is not worth the 30$ I spent. It falls short in so many areas, almost like Painkiller if it had been half as long and released today as is. 5.0/10 its meh.			"

												If you're a fan of Serious Sam or Shadow Warrior (the reboot), you should definitely give this game a try.The campaign is pretty cliche and linear but it plays like an old school shooter where the only think you need to worry about is destroying ♥♥♥♥ing everything with a large arsenal of weapons.You can also wait for it to go on sale if you don't want to pay the full price. It's been as low as $1.49 which is more than a steal for the price.			"

												A first person shooter against robots in a tremendously pretty Cyberpunk world.  The gameplay itself involves an awful lot of running backwards, akin to Serious Sam; there is not the first person bullet hell sort of dodging of Doom, nor the super-speed running and flanking of Painkiller.  But the setting is absolutely breathtaking, and the explosions satisfying and explodey.			"

												Hard Reset is a slick, unforgiving FPS that feels ripped from the genre's roots. Were it not for the updated graphics and more responsive controls, you'd swear this direct was kin to Wolfenstein, Doom, and Quake. Coat it in a lusciously dystopian cyberpunk coat of paint and you've got me by the sensitive bits; just be aware that Hard Reset is liable to kick you in those bits just as readily.Pulling no punches, Hard Reset puts you in the shoes of Fletcher, hands you a strange energy weapon full of upgrade potential, and then starts lobbing wave after wave of robotic foes at you with little time to breathe in between. Action becomes stick-and-move most of the time as you work your way around each level, avoiding fire more than taking cover from it and taking as much advantage as you can of the environment. That environmental element was probably my favorite aspect of the game, as traditional exploding barrels are joined by things such as electrical boxes that can short out your opponents, and just natural-feeling static elements like barriers and columns that can, to some degree, help control enemy direction and flow.Unless you've been maintaining your twitch reflexes since FPS' toddler days or you're gifted with ungodly reaction time, Hard Reset is likely to kick you around quite a bit at first. Stick with it, though, and explore your upgrade options for your weapon. Once you've gotten the feel for the game's flow and found a setup that suits your needs, things start thrumming like, well, machinery.			"

												Ever read reviews and wonder what game they played??  If you played and enjoyed single player campaign FPS from the 90s and early 00s you'll moree than likely enjoy this game.  To the people that say they spent most of the time ""running backwards and shooting"" ... seriously??  Do you not have any clue about tactics?  Lure the creatures into a narrow tunnel and blast them with the shotgun.  Is this game perfect? .. no .. far from it.  Switching between guns and energy weapons is ridiculous.  Weapons aren't great, but they are fun.  Bougtht this game during the steam sale .. and have no regrets.  I wish there was co-op multiplayer and better weapons.  If hard reset and borderlands had a baby it'd be awesome!!!			"

												A graphical tour de force, a playability tour de suck...Checkpoint-based save system; 10 confusingly-accessed, visually indistinct weapons, mostly of the ""too weak"" variety; an ""enhanced vision"" mode that kicks in when you're about to die, and makes it 10x harder to see anything (...and that's *besides* the ""strawberry jam"" effect that appears with equal intensity, whether you are hit for 95% of your health, or 5% of your health!); and a pompous, annoying narrator riding you the whole way -- this game has it all!YMMV and there's certainly worse games out there for ~$5, but ... as cool as it is, it's far from perfect.Gaming press made it sound like the 2nd coming of ""old school"", but it ain't all that, either.

												Hard Reset is an fps in the Serious Sam/Painkiller style of shoot everything around/in front of you. Though it doesn't nearly do it as well as those games sadly. It has really nice visuals in the first levels reminiscent of Blade Runner and has some really nice sound design to go with it. The cons begin with the gameplay leading into a limit of 2 weapons with a strange upgrade system, with upgrades sharing the same ammo for some reason. If one gets the awkward weapon system down, the gameplay gets pretty straightforward and while this game is on the lower end of my recommendation spectrum, I still did have a little bit of fun with this title.

												Hard Reset is a laudable independent attempt at capturing the feel of classic-inspired ""horde"" first person shooters like Painkiller and Serious Sam. The early sensations are great, with a lush-looking Blade-Runner inspired aesthetic and a combat based on detonating strategically placed environmental hazards that will help you stop the hordes of robots running in your direction.Unfortunately, that initial interest doesn´t last much longer. The gameplay turns up extremely shallow and repetitive by the third level, with the same hazards, enemies and pacing (get stuck in arena, kill all enemies, walk until next arena) over and over until the end of the game. The storytelling is dull, the extremely noisy and constrasty visuals full of flashing lights make almost impossible to realize what's happening on screen during the chaotic battles, so you just shoot randomly at moving things. There is barely anything during the game that will surprise you, so whereas the controls are comfortable and the game feels quite polished, the experience will be the exact same from the first to the last minute. ""Hard Reset"" is a clear example of a one-trick-pony of a game.I'd recommend you to play the demo, but I wouldn't spend any money on the full game, since the game deflates almost since the beginning. A somewhat short game that will feel like takes too long to end out of the sheer repetition you'll feel along the journey.			"

												Intense-packed cyberpunk FPS. Interesting weapon choices and upgrade system. I've beaten campain in 7 hours on ""easy"" level, and never got bored of playing. Bosses are good - not regular ""meatballs"" but require some thinking approach. Simple pouring them with bullets and rays is not a winning strategy. In general, very good game.			"

												It's obviously not the 90's throwback we were promessed, but for a modern FPS, I don't think you can have a more oldschool gameplay.The weapon system is confusing at first but once you get used to it, it's a lot of fun.Don't miss the free DLC as well, it's 3 hours long but is overall better than the original game.The only bad points for me are that, even if the action does feel more 90's, the level design is still very linear, and a few secret rooms here and there can't make up for that. Also all the visual effects can get annoying and can make it hard to see what's going on in the middle of a fight, I recommend tuning them down as much as possible in the settings.Good game.			"

												It's a first-person shooter, set in the future, with secret places, exploding barrels, hordes of enemies increasing in difficulty from start to finish, and a grading system at the end of each level. You also get to upgrade things periodically. If that sounds really generic, and like a bunch of other video games have done it already, then that's because it is generic, and a bunch of other video games really have done it already. Quake 4 comes to mind as the next closest thing, because Doom 3 at least plays with darkness and balancing the flashlight and the other weapons and Red Faction: Armageddon at least has vehicles you can drive. Even Painkiller, which has the same linear gameplay and horde battles as Hard Reset, has you turn into a demon and get instant kills (not to mention it has much more imaginative weapons). In summary, if you've played a sci-fi FPS before, you are prepared enough for the things to which Hard Reset will expose you, and if you liked the other games you played along those lines, you'll probably like Hard Reset, too. Get it while it's on sale.			"

												SO I'm giving this a no as in ""would I recommend this to myself"".As a shoot em up, this is ok.  If you like Painkiller I guess you might like this.  Mindless shooting, barely a thread of story etc.  The boss enemies were cool.  Graphics were pretty yummy. However the mechanics of this game.  Press button, kill enemies, try to press button, kill more enemies.  There are about 6 enemies in game total, they just throw more and more at you.  The concepts of having a gun that morphs itself to another type was pretty cool.The concept feels like a cross between Terminator and Quake 2.  It has it's own art style.  Voice acting pretty lame.  I guess if you had never played Quake 2, and wanted something similar, this would be it.  Bearing in mind, Quake 2 is over 15 years old, and is a better game with better AI.Oh, yeah, it's less than 4 hours gameplay, with in my opinion zero replayability (i.e. I'm deleting it as soon as I close this review)			"

A lot of people apparently have trouble finishin this game on the lowest setting, I did on the hardest the first time around because I'm that hardcore! Also features one excellent soundtrack that intesifies as the action gets, well, more intense.You like a cyberpunk setting? You like your FPS done in an oldschool style?

												Hard Reset has the trappings of an oldschool fps but falls short of greatness. The cyberpunk setting is great, however, the level design is pretty bland (easy secrets, invisible walls everywhere), the enemies don't react very much to being fired which leads to somewhat unsatisfying gunplay. I'd really like to see a sequel to this that speeds up the game a little bit and tries to a go a little over the top a bit more with its maps.			"

												This game had great promise, an oldschool style FPS with some modern twists, but ultimately I felt it falls short. The game is does manage to execute one or two of the oldschool elements, but after multiple levels of the same secret room and enemy popping out of a wall it really wears thin.I started on medium difficulty but due to how long it took to actually kill the enemies I lowered it just to speed things up. The game has about 6 different types of enemies that amount to nothing more than bullet sponges. Which would be fine if the guns were any fun to fire. The upgrade system was a good idea, but you end up only using 1 or 2 of the weapons which makes the reset of the upgrades worthless in the end. I did manage to finish the game, which says soemthing, but really I would say your time is better spent on a different FPS.			"

												The good news is that I really like the art style and visual design of the game (it looks great, with lots of little details hidden in the levels on posters and signs and so on, and the cyberpunk theme is a lot of fun), and it mostly feels good to play, like an old school shooter. If that's all there were to it, it would be great, but there were a few things that added up to stop me from finishing the game.It's a ""hard"" game, which in itself can be a good thing, except it's not really hard because it's challenging but because there are situations where you can quickly end up dying for what almost seems to be no reason your first time through because you don't know where the enemies are going to spawn or where the environmental hazards are until you've already seen them. Once you know where everything is, it's suddenly very easy to avoid them all and lead the enemies into traps instead (because they're quite dumb), but it leads to more trial and error than I'd like. Yeah, it's true to the old school spirit of the game, I guess, but I suppose that's not really what I'm feeling up for right now.Combined with that, it doesn't help that you can kind of paint yourself into a corner with the weapon upgrades if you don't choose well. Hint: AoE/splash damage is your friend.Something else I haven't heard other people mention, so it may just be me, is that a couple times I got stuck going in circles for maybe ten minutes, completely unable to tell where I was supposed to go next. I wasn't lost or anything; I just couldn't find any door to go through or button to push or anything because it didn't stand out from the rest of the environment enough, which I haven't really had happen with other games much. I will chalk it up to either my partial color blindness or possibly just me being a dumbass.Anyway, I really wanted to like it, and there were some things about it that I genuinely did think were rather well done, but I had enough frustrating moments that I think I'm going to go back to playing Tower of Guns for my 90s-style FPS needs for the time being.

Posted: September 2, 2014
												I bought this game in the hopes of further supporting the developers, Flying Wild Hog as I enjoyed their title that they released after this game, Shadow Warrior, however the negative reviews that I kept seeing about this game were and are correct in every regard. This game is sold as Old School but it is not, I grew up playing Wolfenstine, Doom, Doom 2, Quake and so on those were old school, this game is simply a pretender that is unable to put forth even the most BASIC of FPS action and gameplay.  If you hear or read anyone speak of this title and Doom/Wolfenstine in the same breath immediately ignore them as they clearly have never played any of the true older titles as they are nothing alike and that is not a good thing.  Flying Wild Hog used the “old school” phrase as a marketing tool, it is an excuse to use that phrase to get people like me who've grown up playing the real old school shooters into thinking that this game will be ANYWHERE close to the caliber that those titles were and continue to be. Everything in those games was always paced properly, always fair; you never felt like you consistently hit a wall and it didn’t feel like luck to get to the next point. This game, regardless of these “upgrades” feels nothing but a shallow shell of what it tired to do and attempts to hype itself up in order to get unsuspecting buyers. Within 20 minutes, I knew that this game had none of what I found enjoyable in Shadow Warrior, clearly the developers learned many of their lessons from this title, as it is beyond inferior or substandard even for a basic FPS game. So far I have gotten zero enjoyment out of the experience, the weapons, much like the ballistic weapons in SW, are liken to a toy and do almost nothing to enemies. Enemies that this game's universe has KNOWN about so therefore they should actually do more then just oh annoy them a little which would make you think that humans would have developed weapons to fight beings that are basically computers. With regards to weapon damage and how they work, there appears so far to be no real way to determine if a one weapon is favored for a particular enemy over the other. Part of this is because every single enemy in this title is a damage sponge making combat experience difficult at best let alone figuring out this game’s mechanics, if one can say that it has any. The smallest of enemies do 50 times more damage then they should to the player and take 100 times more damage then they should given how frequently they put the player into the closest of close quarters with these mostly melee driven enemies and their size. I do still see some of this game’s poisonous form spilling out into their work on SW, as the enemies hit you when you clearly put some distance between you and their attack impact point or enemies that have some kind of city sized hitbox for their attack that will hit you not matter where you are in relation to the unit. In this day and age it is absolutely inexcusable that this kind of programming and blatantly unfair gameplay would be tolerated in ANY development studio. The character you play as seems to be made of paper, thus making enemy attacks even more deadly, dare I say you could right off the bat buy all of starting medical upgrades and STILL not have enough HP to take these unending waves and low amounts of health given. Speaking of your character, he has the lung capacity of a sick new born, he can sprint for exactly 1 meter then becomes haggard, yet we are lead to believe that he is some kind of PMC solder so one would think that he would have some kind of psychical training on top of whatever cybernetics or whatever he may have in him. This lack of stamina will constantly get you killed as enemies will swarm you almost instantly unless you sprint, even though the sprint is rather slow and it barely counts, adding to that the horrible visual effect that portrays the visual of sprinting. Unlike Shadow Warrior, you do not have the ability to dodge, which in this game’s case is a seriously negative omission because it is made by the same people the enemy types or attack types are roughly the same and need to be dodged. Your character however moves as such a slow pace on top of having almost zero stamina makes for even WALKING out of the way or trying to side step an enemy’s attack nearly impossible if not inconsistent. You my notice that I have yet to talk about the “story line” I have chosen to omit that because as MANY others have talked about that aspect of the game I have really nothing more to add.  The only thing that I will add is that I agree with their sentiment, the story is miniscule it would seem as if someone saw a bunch of science fiction movies and told their 10 year old to write a script while keeping those scenes in mind.  It is confusing only because it does so little to explain anything, this includes the game’s universe, this means the characters and their interactions, this means the locations and their significance, and this means the protagonist and his goals.  All the items that are essential to a proper story and the game provide none of that.  The sad part is that there is a lot of atmosphere within this universe which is obviously taken almost directly from Blade Runner.  The checkpoint system is absolute garbage and the developers felt it necessary to steal away the game’s quick save feature which is in almost Every PC game.  Especially given this game’s insane difficulty this is a crime and there are zero reasons as to why the developers choose to take out the quick save/quick load function or why they made the checkpoints so spread out other then to give the game yet another layer of fake, artificial difficulty. I really do not know how the developers slept at night knowing they made such horrible game design choices and then had the gall to market it as an old school shooter. I honestly should have just listened to the negative reviews of this game and just stayed playing or liking Flying Wild Hogs for making SW because now my opinion of them is soured by this experience. I wanted to support them by buying their other title but now I really am unsure if I will ever bother subjecting myself to this…Experience. Which is a damn shame because visually it’s a nice universe and a semi-possible interesting story, but it is all hampered by overly punishing gameplay mechanics, claustrophobic level design and bad mechanics, I was really hoping that the other reviewers were wrong, but I see that that was not the case. This title is not a game, or what I would consider a game, a game is supposed to be fun, an enjoyable experience that keeps you coming back, this game has failed to carry with it any of the most basic FPS ideas and put them to use, for that it fails as a game and a title.I wanted so much to like this game, or at the very least like more then 50% of it so that I could come away with at least some fond memories of my time in game.  I even pressed forward and beat the game in order to satisfy my completionist side and to confirm for myself that there was nothing positive about this game worth remembering or noting.  Beating the entire title with its added extra content DLC (which confuses the “story” even more) I feel that I have seen all that there is to see about this title and that no amount of extra time within this title’s universe will change my mind.

												This game feels like a rushed copy of Quake. I would recommend it for killing some time if it wasn't for the following issues:- Low variety of enemies and attack patterns- Dumb AI. Enemies only follow you horizontally and don't try to cut your escape, just keep following.- Weird HitBoxes: Your HitBox appears to be bigger than it should. Dodging is dodgy. Hitting too.- Invisible walls everywhere, probaby to make up for the enemy AI.- Cliché story, characters and weapons. I don't mind a bit of cliché, but this much.... some creativity wouldn't hurt.- The jump mechanic doesn't really help at all.- Linear, boring, not compelling, repetitive to kingdom come.- The skill system, or whatever that thing is.... doesn't add anything to the game, doesn't allow you to ""biuld your own character"" or ""play your own way"" at all. It's more like a way to not to give you everything at the beginning. Doesn't add up anything to the game. - The music is generic and uninspired, just like the rest of the gameOn the good side:-Graphics are nice- Cyberpunk sci-fi setting- You get to blow stuff up- Main character curses way more than the dialogue requires.- You get to blow a lot of stuff up- Secrets often show up right under your nose. You can cheat yourself into thinking you're really good at finding them.- You'll appreciate much more the next game you pick up.- You get to.... yeah, right.So, if you feel like killing some time with some mindless (really mindless) straight-forwarded shooter, get it, it's your money after all, just try to wait for a sale if you're not in a rush. Oh, and get a rpg with laser tracking device before you end the main story. You'll thank me later.			"

												I hate to say this.... ...but I cannot recommend this game. I would love to do it, because the game tries to do everything in the right way, but I simply can't, because this time it just doesn't work. It's a shame, because Flying Wild Hog did a bunch of things right. Hell, they nearly headed the perfect direction, but there are a few bad development decisions that have a significant impact in the final result. As I don't want to give the impression that this is an awful game or anything like that, I will start telling what does this game do right, because it does a couple of things right. This game is an amazingly beautiful game. It invites to just stop and look at everything. Graphical fidelity is great (really impressive for an Indie tittle), artistic design is UNBELIEVABLE, and it runs like charm (at least on my HD7970). The hand drawn cinematic, similar to those in Mirror's Edge, are really cool and hide the loading times pretty well. This is maybe the strongest feature of the game, it's technical side is amazing. Way better than expected. The game then wants you to run. Its action it's extremely fast paced, demanding you to aim fast, shoot fast and think fast. It also demands you to search for health, to use objects in the map to cover from fire (sometimes there are so many enemies shooting at you that otherwise is impossible) while enemies moving to get you out of your cover without the regular magical mechanics of AAA shooters which regenerate health and let you stay there for ages. In 2013 all I can say is Hooray for Flying Wild Hog! Even AI is better than usual. It isn't smart, but it's very very aggressive. Even the weapons, which seem to be a bit lackluster at the beginning, are pretty good once you start upgrading them. And there's a huge difference between every weapon, making each of them good or bad depending on the situation. Again, well done. So, if the game does so much things right, why does it fail? Because there are two important things that it does wrong. First one is the level design. Even if I love all the chances it gives to use map elements to kill the enemies, every level ends up being a corridor with some arenas in between and some secrets here and there. It's very Serious Sam-esque, but the design of every zone (specially in big arenas) is much worse. Sometimes really dull. It's not enough to leave me in an empty place with some objects and throw a bunch of enemies at me. To do that right you need a place that is awesome. For example, the town fight in one of the last levels of Serious Sam 3, or the different fights in the Egyptian ruins, are leagues beyond anything this game achieve. But is not only the level design what is flawed, but the enemy design. I'm not only talking about aesthetics, but behavior. Some robots are cool (the one that charges on you), but some other are just dull and the game relies too much in throwing lots of them at you. Again, this works in Serious Sam because every enemy presents a different and well balanced threat. Here it doesn't. Also doesn't help that some of them, if they are a bit far from you, look a lot like the environment, making them difficult to be seen. This two things lead to some very uninteresting fights, which considering this is a shooter is like a capital flaw. Talking about the story... well, there's not too much to say. It doesn't help the game, neither kills it. Just an average one which is never very important for the enjoyment of the game. Considering all of this, I cannot recommend it. And it's a shame, because it's a game I wanted to like, but I just don't enjoy it too much. That doesn't mean some other people won't enjoy it, because it still gets many things right, but here the scale is just a binary yes/no, so this one gets a no. Anyway, Flying Wild Hog looks like a very promising studio. I'll take a look sooner or later at their Shadow Warrior, and I'll definitely wait for their next projects.			"

												Hard reset is a game that tries very hard to be like the old school shooters like Serious Sam, Pain killer, Duke and Shadow Warrior, unfortunately it falls very flat.The story and writing are beyond awful, I can only assume it wasn't written by a English speaker as quite a lot of the dialogue is incorrect in English, getting an English localisation for your game is a very easy process, how that wasn't accomplished here is confusing to say the least.The visual idenity of the game is confused, the style of props and materials don't fit well together at all, the enemy visual design blurs them into the background, the scale of the world is completely off and the FX are massively overdone to a point where sometimes you can't see. Not ideal for a game such as this.The level design is attrocious, invisible walls everywhere, random elevators and doors everywhere that can't be opened till you eliminate the enemies (this can be grounded into the game in a much better way, the new Shadow warrior does exactly that).On the plus side, the approach to physics and destruction is nice to see and the computer interfaces are pretty cool tech that isn't in enough games.How this has a positive rating is beyond me, if you want to play a game like this that is actually good, go get Shadow Warrior (on further viewing, Shadow Waarrior is by the same developer, so definately skip this and just get Shadow Warrior)			"

												I bought this game on sale for 3 euros. Not worth my money.PROS-The gameplay is funny at first hour-The ambientation is good-The graphic is decent (the game is really fast-paced, so it's improbable that you will stop for looking at the texture or other details)-It's short (and now let's see why it's a pro)CONS-Repetitive Gameplay-Only few type of enemy-Decent number of weapon but some are completely useles-The story is bad (I know that in this kind of FPS the story is only marginal, but they could have done much better)-The Boss fight are really stupid. Just kill all the normal enemy protected behind a wall, than shoot the week point of the boss. Then repeat five or six times. No skill needed.-The final. Yeah. Because there isn't even a final. Only a boss fight and a silly dialogue.-Difficulty is very unbalanced and the shield system doesn't work properly-Music is really forgettable. Damn, i've finished the game two hours ago and I don't remember the soundtrak-Shooting system is not sufficient for this time of FPS, not accurate enough. And the aiming system with the rifle...oh god! Terrible.These six hours were really boring and frustrating. Now you understand why the shortness is a pro?Mark: 5  "

												Personal Rating: 4/10I want to cringe every time I play this game, even if I've only played ten minutes of it. It's just another gritty, brown shooter like Call of Duty or Gears of War. The levels are simplistic, walk from A to B, destroying enemies as you go in the grey background. The guns are weak, the standard, stock machine gun and the blue flame gun? I haven't got a clue what it is but that doesn't matter right? As long as it kills things, which is a bit of a laugh because the enemies are either incredibly weak or incredibly strong. I was playing on easy because I was tired and I was quite surprised by how much damage some of the enemies did. I finished the first mission and could handle no more, I got tired of doing the same thing over and over. Kill enemies, blow up fuse box, kill enemies etc. It was a grind. The only nice thing I can say about this game is that it isn't as♥♥♥♥♥♥as Deadfall Adventures which is an acheivement in it's own rights.			"

												There's the spirit of a fun game inside there, somewhere, but there are so many problems i'd suggest you don't bother with it.For starters, the weapon system is awful. There are two weapons (bullet and plasma) and each have 5 firing modes. Despite the fact that this means that to switch from a plasma weapon to say, a shotgun, you have to switch weapon and then switch mode, the two weapons and their modes are really too similar, and there doesn't seem to be any advantage over using one or the other (ammo is everywhere for both, they seem to deal the same amount of damage, etc)Both the enviroment and the enemies are so murky you can't tell them apart, and the lack of color is a strain on the eyes and a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥But what i think is the worst part is that it seems to be an arena shooter, for the incredibly large amount of enemies that spawn from nowhere and the ""variety"" of weapons. but there's no autorun and a limited sprint, the jump is ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and there are no armor pickups, the armor regenerates painfully slow. It seems they couldn't decide if they wanted to make a military shooter or an arena shooter, and they decided to present this mess.In shory, i can't reccomend Hard Reset. Blowing robots up is fun, but it's issues after a while become well too irritating.			"

												Just played a few minutes, cannot quite say whether I recommend it or not. But here are my first few thoughts:* Cutscenes as comic is cheap. I will let them get away with it if the story is any good. But the opened does not promise much in that regard.* Destructible walls seem over-done. Nothing new, but I still like it. But having destroyed a little bit short of 10 walls in the few minues I play seems excessive.* Restrictive pathing! This is the biggest annoyance for me. You can't jump over certain objects because the game decides you shouldn't. Even if you character could physically make the jump. This is really annoying.* Motion blur while running is overdone and annoying. You seem to be able to switch it off in the settings. I will do so when I lauch the game for the next time.* I've been running around quite a lot, but so far have only seen 3 variants of enemies... in increasing numbers. I hope this will improve soon.* Moving objects around seems to only take into account the distance you moved before bumping into it. So you cannot push objects an indefinite distance and you and up bumping into it, stepping back, bumping into it again, stepping back again, and so on...So far for my first impression...			"

												I tried to like this game.  I really did.  I booted this game up on three seperate occasions in an attempt to get through it, but why bother if it's not fun?  The whole ordeal was a slog through slow paced shooting sections.  There is obviously an attention to to detail here, but the core elements of the game are just fundamentally broken.  The story is delivered through minimal character voice overs during gameplay and short comic strip-like segments between loading screens.  The voice is acting is...decent, and the comic style of the cutscenes is interesting.  But beyond an interesting comic style and a neo-future cyberpunk setting, this game falls flat.There is an attempt at interest, but the cyberpunk setting is washed out by a spew of browns and grays in a variety of dark and blue-tinted areas.  The setting never really feels different between two locations: street level and underground.  The enemies are all bulletsponges and their design are both from an aesthetic standpoint, and a gameplay standpoint, uninspired.  Every enemy is a one trick pony, repeatedly attempting to kill with it's one attack mechanism.  For most enemies, you simply dodge while holding down the trigger until either they blow up, or you run out of ammo.  The topic of dodging leads me to my next point that the level design is awful.  I would expect this kind of design from a student project, not a full release game.  The areas are excessively linear with obvious tells for every single ambush of enemy robots.  Environmental hazards play a large role in the combat, but everything is incredibly played out.  If there is going to be a wave of enemies to ambush you, there will also be a series of explosive barrels or electrical spouting conduits to fry them up.  Most enemy encounters are simply there to pad the experience.  Many times enemies seemed to just appear in an area because the game said so.  Most combat was either myself against a large charging enemy in an open area, or myself against many small enemies in a closed area.  When you are required to dodge many small enemies in a closed off corridor like area with minimal movement, it's not fun, it's not a challenge, it's frustrating.  In one instance, an ambush blew through a wall, but upon inspection of their entrance point, it was a closed concrete block in a hole.You only get two weapons in the game.  Each one has it's own twist, and the weapon variety is accomplished through allowing upgrades for each of these two weapons.  Through the usage of upgrades, your bullet based weapon and your plasma based weapon can each turn into 4 other weapons, totalling 10 different guns.  However, these guns feels the same.  None of your attacks seem to have presence.  Accuracy is abyssmal, and when combined with the fact that all enemies have massive amounts of health (or you simply don't deal any damage) any combat interacting is simply tedious.The movement is a joke too.  For a game that so heavily relies on dodging telegraphed enemy attacks, movement is stagnant and stale feeling.  Your characters jaunts around at a slightly sluggish speed.  You have the ability to sprint - if I could even call it that - but it really just makes your character move slightly faster for only a few seconds and makes your screen and HUD shake a lot.  The jump is floaty, as if your character lacks weight, and you also can't jump while sprinting.  There was a speed puzzle where a lift needed to be activated by a button across the room.  You then had to run down a staircase and across the room before it went back up.  With the sluggish controls, it was tedious and took multiple attempts before realizing that to get there faster, I should not sprint, so that I could jump into the lift as it was going up.There are definitely some cool concepts here.  Floating UIs for upgrade panels and actual interaction screens for devices in the game are interesting and function very well.  The visuals themselves are very good.  Everything is for the most part impressively rendered and the visual effects are nice to look at.  But the art style, the sluggish controls, unvaried weapons, and completely uninteresting and uninspired combat really sink this game.  I tried to like it, but I can't and shouldn't have to force myself to clear a game out of my backlog.			"

However, if you're looking for a modern, yet old-school shooter, grab Serious Sam 3, Painkiller or Shadow Warrior.

												I tried to like this game.  I really did.  I booted this game up on three seperate occasions in an attempt to get through it, but why bother if it's not fun?  The whole ordeal was a slog through slow paced shooting sections.  There is obviously an attention to to detail here, but the core elements of the game are just fundamentally broken.  The story is delivered through minimal character voice overs during gameplay and short comic strip-like segments between loading screens.  The voice is acting is...decent, and the comic style of the cutscenes is interesting.  But beyond an interesting comic style and a neo-future cyberpunk setting, this game falls flat.There is an attempt at interest, but the cyberpunk setting is washed out by a spew of browns and grays in a variety of dark and blue-tinted areas.  The setting never really feels different between two locations: street level and underground.  The enemies are all bulletsponges and their design are both from an aesthetic standpoint, and a gameplay standpoint, uninspired.  Every enemy is a one trick pony, repeatedly attempting to kill with it's one attack mechanism.  For most enemies, you simply dodge while holding down the trigger until either they blow up, or you run out of ammo.  The topic of dodging leads me to my next point that the level design is awful.  I would expect this kind of design from a student project, not a full release game.  The areas are excessively linear with obvious tells for every single ambush of enemy robots.  Environmental hazards play a large role in the combat, but everything is incredibly played out.  If there is going to be a wave of enemies to ambush you, there will also be a series of explosive barrels or electrical spouting conduits to fry them up.  Most enemy encounters are simply there to pad the experience.  Many times enemies seemed to just appear in an area because the game said so.

												I tried to like this game.  I really did.Normally I write out longer reviews, but I'm going to try to mimic the game by being short and totally underwhelming: this game will do nothing original, but it's not cookie cutter.  It isn't fun, but you won't be bored.  The gun-play is bland, though you've likely never seen a gun like the one in this game.I'd say it's safe to avoid, even if you are looking for an old-school shooter (like I was).  It's not the worst 4-5 hours you could use, but you'll walk away scratching your head at the ending. (True story: I didn't know I had beaten the game until a day after the fact when I tried to play some more.  And it doesn't even build up to anything.  It's almost like a slice of life...of a failing, futuristic robot-infested city.)			"

												Got this cheap in a sale. For that price, it's a decent enough game, but there are a few things holding it back. Some of the times I died, I wasn't sure what killed me, or you could get jammed into the corner by enemies and then meleed quickly to death. In some places you're deliberately shoved into tiny areas with large monsters... which I tend to find irritating rather than a fair challenge. The upgrade system was kinda fun, though I'm not sure what the point of having two guns was - in this game 1 gun can have 5 functions, which are all the different weapon types you need. Seems a better prospect to use just one of the gun types rather than both... I stuck with the mechanical gun throughout. Played through on Normal mode... though if the harder modes requrie more ammo, you may want to have rocket launcher/shotgun/machinegun combo on both. The enemy HUD upgrade I think should've been a default feature rather than an upgrade tbh. The game is pretty short, but if you're buying this in a sale, the length doesn't matter as much... but the ending is definitely cliffhanger'd, which was disapponting for me. I think they could have written a bit more on it, even if they left a challenge open at the end of it, just to add to the sense of completion. In general, the plot could do with a little more beefing up, just to get a better sense of the world and what the heck is going on. You're not going to find a groundbreaking plot here, but I don't think it's the kind of game that needs a unique plot.As far as technical problems go, I didn't experience any bugs ingame that I noticed, but I did have the game crash twice, and unsure why. Did knock my progress back a bit, but not too far. Played the game on ultra, got the odd bit of slowdown when things were really busy (2-3 times), but definitely playable on my rig... so I regard it as a decently performing game. In general, I wouldn't recommend this game to people, but if you're a big fan of shooters, you may have some fun with it.			"

												Mostly spent hours pushing boxes and trashcans epic distances to try to reach secrets, only to find it was reachable at the next area.  Don't really care for arbitrary boundries that look just as jumpoverable as spots that don't have them, and how you can't go back to an area after clearing it. Bosses can be unforgiving or crazy easy depending on position. It's a lot of kiting around/destroying but fun. Story isn't anything special and is pretty vague, but the levels look nice and aren't completely linear. Some of the gun upgrades make it too easy but ofc don't have to use them. As expected, lots of challenging rushes involved and don't expect much else.			"

												Bred from the same stones as Painkiller, Hard Reset fosters old school shooter gameplay by throwing large quantities of enemies at you with quick-switching weapons that provide a variety of functionality.  Of rare not is that Hard Reset is a PC EXCLUSIVE; the textures are phenomenal, all lighting is done realtime, the interface is entirely designed around pointing devices and the weapons offer boons to those with pinpoint accuracy.For it's price, assuming you're one of the pedigree, it doesn't get any better than Hard Reset.  Forgive the lack of multiplayer, terrible story and muted movement for the chaos and enjoyment that comes from the combat.			"

												Upgrade and weapon systems are cool, but basically everything else about the game is flawed in some degree ranging from ""irritating"" to ""♥♥♥♥ing unforgivable"". Enemies are bullet-sinks (and I was only playing on Normal, there are two levels beyond that... how bad must THOSE be?), taking way too long to kill. Let's not even go into how ludicrous the bosses near the game's end are. If you want to go secret-hunting, have fun getting irritated by the lack of a crouch button (which would let you collect half of them with ease, as they're visible beside a hole in a fence or broken wall). Instead you'll need to solve a jumping puzzle somewhere nearby... and jumps are floaty as♥♥♥♥♥♥ Real fun when they become required in the endgame to progress on the last levels.The devs did good by releasing ""Exile"" for free to Steam owners (an expansion/epilogue) but it's still based on the same game and no extra upgrades, kind of a letdown. Maybe their next game will be excellent.			"

												This is a very fun FPS that is made like a classic FPS. You have two weapons, but they each have 5 types so you technically have 10 weapons, all with different upgrades. There are also many hidden secret rooms like old classic FPSs.The story is a little interesting with a war between humans and machines that decide to rebel, however I can't honestly say I know much else more than that as it doesn't seem to explain the story too well.

												Another customer suckered in by the demo.  Seemed like a cookie cutter shooter, which is what I was looking for.In today's age of ""gittin' gud"", I just can't be bothered with this one.  People yelled and spat about Bioshock Infinite having bullet sponge enemies, and yet, 1,600+ positive reviews for this game??  Gamers today are ♥♥♥♥ed in the head.  But I digress.Look up any Negative review, and I pretty much agree with all.  Only positive thing to come out of this is the futuristic setting if you like that sort of thing -- which is another reason I wanted to try my hand at it.-Weapons AND upgrades are practically useless.-Enemies never stun until they're half or 3/4 dead, and in which case you're still getting swarmed.-The weapon switch is HORRIBLY slow.  If you want to sell your typical fast-paced FPS, MAKE THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SWITCH FASTER.  My god, you're almost forced to constantly switch in dire situations, and yet the developers thought it'd be a good idea to make the rifle/energy switch slow as♥♥♥♥♥♥  Doesn't add challenge, just adds annoyance.-Closed environments with enemies meant to be blown up by the cars/tanks/etc?  BAD IDEA.  But what do I know.  Gamers today will cut their wrists open just to say they beat somthing hard.  I just don't have the time or patience for games like this anymore where the developers purposely make one aspect good, but another point doubly, and glaringly, worse just to make the NEET MLG kids gloat about it on forums.

												This is a pretty average game that doesn't earn my recommendation I'm afraid. The environment is kind of Bladerunner meets Borderlands with the ""old skool"" play style of Doom. The game has two weapons, each of which has a series of modes.. nice but too complicated to switch between in the heat of battle. When you are taking hits, you have no real feel for how badly you are being hit and the difficulty curve is well, more rollercoaster than curve. The game also teases you with openings beneath fences etc, but the lack of a crouch or pick up ability serve to frustrate. Similarly, jumping is flawed... you cannot jump over balustrades or ledges that you might otherwise expect to, instead our action hero has to walk to the stairs.... You spend a lot of time fighting multiple enemies at once, but their surprise appearances are entirely predictable. The art style is quite nice and the engine smooth, but the levels are all pretty samey and it gets tired quickly. There also seem to be a lot of fork lift trucks blocking the way, hardly puzzling, and the game quite frequently tells you where to go with a hint system before you even have a chance to figure it out (if indeed you could). So in summary, it's an ok game, but not really recommended.  It tries to be old skool but doesn't quite pull it off and fire fights tend to be a case of holding down the fire button whilst strafing around for health and pickups.If you can manage to persevere and grind through the monotony of the first 2 hours or so, there are some epic boss battles to be had but the surprise spam attacks continue throughout. There ain't no sneaking up on enemies in this game, they prefer the magician's approach.			"

												Just my opinion, but I feel the game has poor game design.It feels like its padding its short play time (which is not a bad thing in my opion, shorter is better sometimes to me) with a bad check point system and an unneeded barrage of enemies... constantly. Die, then wait for loading, about 30 seconds. With minimal loading (3-5 sec), or a better checkpoint system it would have worked and felt challenging but enjoyable. There's also the kind of weird upgrade system.Amazing graphics, love the art syle. The comic style art scene and loading screens are beautiful.Good sound design and atmosphere as well.If you like games that are punishing, then this is for you...i guess.Not a bad game, just not a game I'd recommned to anyone I know after playing it.

												SHORT REVIEW:The developers have no idea how to make a videogame.LONG REVIEW:I have no idea where to begin on how bad this game is. As a fan of mindless shooter, I can't fathom how flawed the game is in its core.The character's movement does not feel the player is in control entirely to compensate the chaotic situations that the game constantly puts the player in, as sprinting and jumping are not very fluid. You cannot jump freely while sprinting, you lose a bit of handling while at it, and sprinting lasts for a very short period of time.All of the enemies (and I mean all of them), have faster movement speed, usually 2 to 3 times faster than the character so the player is forced to be constantly moving with the game's awful controls.The game seriously lacks variety of enemy types, but it also suffers from their flawed designs. Enemies should be very exciting to fight, but they are incredibly annoying to deal with. There are self-destructive bots that move in an incredible speed whose explosion radius is massive, shockwave emitting crawlers which lock on you (for the most of the time you cannot avoid them easily) when charging at an accelerated speed, ranged gunners whose projectiles travel as fast as bullets, fast-moving rollers who charge at you to saw your limbs off, and other varieties of the said enemy types.What's worse is that the game tends to put all of these annoying enemies in a single wave at once in which the player has to rely on variety of lucks or stupid AIs doing funky things to beat.The game features about 3 different enemy types with different armor levels and different weapons on them. Some of these types have no weaknesses on how to kill them without almost dying. The game still gives you enough regen after a wave to restore back to perfect health, but it is no excuse to design a game where the player is meant to be hurt to almost death situations after every wave. This is the most frustrating part of the game. I died the average of 3 times per chapter, and  after those deaths I didn’t bother changing a strategy and was still able to beat the level I had trouble with, because the enemy AIs were so unpredictable and had no counter-strategy to work with. It was all just luck for the most part. Explosion radius is bigger than the usual player’s predictions in the game’s FOV (and the game basically feeds on explosions), most of projectiles are semi-homing and they also explode dealing damage to the player around even though it misses, small enemies charge at you while you are dealing with bigger enemies and vice versa, and most of them don’t have any counter-strategies to work with. One of my favorite mindless shooter is the Serious Sam series, and the game had enemies that were simply very fun to play against, so I can tell you that mindless shooter does not mean mindless design.The level design is nothing of stellar, and sometimes makes no sense at all. The game has a hint system telling the player what to do, only when they reach a point. Here's why the hint system is completely useless: There are points that emit green lights where the player has to go and interact with to advance in the level and it's ALWAYS just as simple as clicking on the button when they reach the point. However, the developers think the players lack brain so it tells them to “click on the button to ... (insert any unnecessary information)”. The problem is that the levels aren’t designed well enough to sometimes let player know where to go in the dark environment, and the game does nothing to assist the player with. It tells the player to click on the button once they reach the only green-lit interactive interfaces which is completely useless. Later in the game, the levels have so many map decorations that are lit green with interfaces that cannot be interacted with. The players are accustomed to click on whatever that has an interface screen and green-lit, and the final levels of the game break this one rule that they’ve been training their players with. Often there will be times where it damages the player for absolutely no reason with some pre-scripted moving objects. There is no way to avoid them, and the game gives you a regen shortly after. Why were these put in the sequence in the first place?The game looks pretty nice, but it is nothing of amazing. If the game was released on the consoles I doubt it would look as decent as any other average titles. I was playing this on my 780 Ti and I still experienced frame drops on chaotic situations, which the most of the game is in except when the player is walking to point A from point B. I can only assume the game is terribly optimized at best.The game is the definition of frustration. There were so many flawed designs with no sense of innovation being found from the game, so I had to look up who in the world developed this terrible game. Flying Wild hog, as stupid as their name sounds, had no experience as it was their first game in the market. I will make sure to avoid any games from them in the future and so should anyone who wants to have fun with videogames.			"

												At the start this game got off on the right foot. Corporation run lifestyle with robots sabotaging things? Sweet, right up my alley. After the first few kills I was still having fun. Upgrades for weaponry with a slick UI that was built into the game so it felt extremely fluid. The world felt, albeit deserted, lived in in a way.Seconds later I started to notice the glaring flaws with the game. While attempting to sprint away from a horde of enemies, I found out that sprint only lasts for maybe a second or two, quickly giving me false hope of getting out of the situation unharmed while I sought better cover. I noticed that the two guns, an EMP rifle and a standard assault rifle, had no real difference other than looks. I upgraded said weapons to allow one to give me an area effect and one with a grenade. The area effect was useful, but still allowed enemies far too close for comfort, and the grenades were just...useless. ""Oh well, maybe they need more upgrades."" I lied to myself as I pressed on. Soon I found myself becoming irritated by the obvious pickups just out of reach in a crouch-able area. I tried every button then went into my key bindings, low and behold there was no crouch button. Soon after these flaws arose, thinking I was lucky, I attempted to jump on a few crates to hurdle a barrier to get a secret pickup. Right as I reached the top, I was met with an invisible wall. I groaned and moved on, and within a few short moments I was met with the irritation that caused me to quit the game: ""This barrier is self-powered, you've got to find a way around it."" I walked up to the barrier, and just to the right was a tunnel through some scaffolding. I moved towards it quickly as the robots surrounded me. It was about a foot too short, and here I am, a cybernetic soldier with permanently fixed knees and apparently a spine as well. I couldn't duck under to get through, and the robot army behind me quickly ripped me to pieces.tl;dr: If you are a sadist with games that give you plenty of false hope, buy it now, don't even wait for a sale. If you are anything else, please let my experience be enough for you.			"

												A rare game where the cutscenes cause the story to make LESS sense. Is there a story? I have no idea anymore.This wouldn't be an issue (especially since the game markets itself as a shooter in the veign of Serious Sam / Painkiller / Doom) but after the first hour of gameplay you realize you've seen all the game has to offer. It has some neat ideas (like only having two guns, you just put different mods onto them) but the enemies and enviornments quickly become bland and the story remains present enough that it's distracting. The game also has some weird difficulty spikes - at times you'll breeze through and other random points see you mashing the Quick Save button.			"

												Hard Reset is a game with great high-level ideas and infuriating moment-to-moment gameplay experiences. I am generally so busy asking myself questions like ""Why am I getting hurt?"", ""Why can't I jump over this foot-high railing?"", ""Why is it so hard to switch to the right weapon/mode combination when I'm getting swarmed by sawblade-bots?"", ""Why can't I jump over this foot-high brick?"", ""Why do I have to turn on a generator to turn off that energy barrier?"", ""Why did that energy barrier randomly turn back on after I went through so much trouble to turn it off?"", or ""Why can I jump onto this two-foot high box, but then once on it can't jump over the three-foot high wall next to it?"" that I can't really appreciate the strategic depth of the upgrade system, the old school nonlinear level design, or the treasure hunt for all the secret caches. Those are things that generally excite me, but the experience of the game for me is mostly fumbling with weapon controls and slamming into invisible walls.			"

												This is a shooter with pretty graphics and a nice environment.However, the gameplay is pretty awful. Combat is very fast-paced and quickly over. This is nothing like Serious Sam, where you need to dodge enemies. You will spend some time trying to solve unlikely puzzles or simply following the goal indicator.In short, this is a shooter with modern graphics but heavily outdated gameplay. Do not buy, there are a lot better alternatives out there.			"

												In my opinion this is a horrible game. First of the graphics arent even great. Second the AI is way too overpowered. If they swarm you, you are done for. Enjoy your bloodbath. The Enemies are so small they come out of no where and you are like there is no one in front of me how am i taking damage. The hints only show up if yu look at a certain object, they do not stay if you look away. For the first 15-20 mins I was saying this is a great game, then as I played more I started to regret it.

												I'm a big fan of Shadow Warrior 2013 and could feel a lot of the same in Hard Reset but ultimately I think Flying Wild Hog missed the mark here.The old school shooter vibe they were going for was fine and dandy but they really dropped the ball with the movement. It just wasn't fluid enough movement for the style of game. You feel bogged down in what is otherwise an endless assault of great action and eye-candy. And things were rather flat. Jumping was clunky and thus underutilized in general. You remained on one plane despite some vertical level designs. And jumping was never involved in battles, just strafe til things are dead. Then your character just feels half a step too slow for a game where you need to constantly be moving. By the halfway point the movement was begging me to call it quits but I ultimately stuck it out thanks to some highlights like the boss battles.There's a lot of other bad aspects though. All of them I would've forgiven if the movement had been smoother! But instead, they stick out. Like how much of bullet sponges the enemies really are. it isn't a valid complaint on it's own because, well, they're suppose to be! But when it feels like you're strafing through mud it gets tiresome. Another annoyance was the slight bit of RNG ""dodge"" or ""miss"" involved on top of them being those bullet sponges. Enemies had dodge animation that would only show half the time you missed an on target shot... The other half of the ""dodges""? Well... I'm left guessing, but I will; I think the animations just don't kick in. And this leaves your shots literally going through the enemies with no effect. It was quite odd and visually off putting. Again though, something I would overlook if I had smoother control of my movement and things were just faster overall.Regular enemies just come in waves and you strafe and shoot hoping you can absorb more shots than they can. Weapons didn't need to be elaborate or varied and they aren't. Plenty of secret areas to be found during downtime. Extremely sparsely sprinkled platforming jumps that are just out of place. All sectioned off by absolutely awesome boss battles. And all packaged in underrated good looks, honestly don't get the need for the Redux as far as the visuals go. But supposedly there's a little more to it than window dressing. But I do believe I will be passing on Redux nonetheless. I had hints of fun and appreciate Flying Wild Hog's approach, but was one of those games that becomes a chore to finish rather than a thrill. And really really odd abrupt ending by the way. I mean I felt it coming but just weird.			"

												A largely forgetable game with *horrible* writing and pretty bad voice acting. The story makes basically no sense, the plot hardly advances at all except in one or two places, and the main character uses ""the f-word"" and ""the s-word"" and other expletives so often that they lose all meaning. The game looks great, and the combat is actually quite well done, but after the 3rd or 4th variation of the same npc coming at you, and the predictability of enemy enounters, it all gets old very fast. There's also only one ""combat music"" track that you hear throughout the entire game. It smacks of being the first game of a new crew, written by someone without a firm grasp of English or experience in how to tell a story. PROTIP: When writing dialogue, ""the f-word"" is not an acceptable replacement for ""very"", ""damn"", ""ouch"", ""huh"", or ""oh look, that's an interesting thing on the horizon."" By the mid-point of the game I was utterly bored, and just grabbed a trainer from GameCopyWorld so I could blow through the rest of it, which I did. The ending sucked. I've heard FWH's Shadow Warrior remake is quite good, but after playing this, I find those reports dubious. I'll still play it, though. I can't recommend this to anyone, except as an example of how NOT to tell a story.Edit: I've just learned that Steam censors ""curse words"", which is a load of crap, so I've made some changes.			"

												Interesting setting but the weapons feel too weak.  What the game calls ""great weapon variety"" is two weapons that can be upgraded with four extra fire modes.  After playing two hours none of the upgrades made the weapons stronger but the enemies certianly were.  Playing on normal I was not dying much but each fight felt more like work than fun as you slowly whittle away at each enemy.  I can not imagine what it will be like end game.

												The basic Hard Reset experience is arcade-shooting action in a nutshell. You have only two guns, a gun that uses bullets and one that uses energy. However, the base guns (basicly rifles) have additional shotgun, gernade, mine-throwing, and various single power-shot modes that can be unlocked with points earned from kills and from scavenging yellow-glowing-box-things scattered throughout the levels. The varitions between similier modes for each gun are minor (the bullet-gun shotgun is slow and single-shot, the energy version is a wide spray of electricity for as long as you hold down the trigger), but the differences do add up.Your only enemies are machines, which is good and bad. It's good if you like watching your target's armored body fall apart, but bad if you don't like bullet-spongy enemy. Several large foes take forever to kill. However, the degree of bullet sponge was acceptable to me, as per the enemies. The enemies themselves are limited for the first part of the game, which I liked because it made it easier to learn patterns, especially for large groups of enemies (there are several). The Enhanced content adds some new foes, however, and a flying version is both very deadly (it shoots back) and extremely annoying.The combat in Hard Reset is the meat of the game, and is intense and demanding (many enemies focus on melee, meaning they throw themselves at you in large masses). Impediments to progess are all extremely basic keypad interacts that are thankfully less annoying than keycards. There is an extensive story, but I got sick of it early, and when the extended content shows up I'm pretty sure the whole thing stops making much sense, anyway.If you like the momentum and skill required by games that utilize healthpacks over regenerating health, you will probably like this game.Video!

												The completely broken enemy spawning makes this game almost unplayable; they just appear randomly with no real way to be able to guess where and are frequently spawned behind you, which you only know when they blow away 50% of your health.Beating a level consists of being killed by BS enemy spawns and then memorising them after loading the checkpoint.Some nice ideas, like the two modular weapons and good choice in weapons.But generally a frustating game with VERY bad HUD( health, ammo, etc un-readable for ~1 second after sprinting and taking damage) and the levels are generally narrow, constricted spaces with custer f*** enemy waves.

												This one came out of left field.The game is visually fantastic and solid, featuring the benefits of modern FPS and Classic FPS design. The setting is especially well crafted with good voice acting and comic book style cutscenes telling the story. It definitely derives influence from '80's and 90's science fiction such as Blade Runner and The Fifth Element. There's even a dash of Film Noir with the player character portrayed as a cynical authority figure.Check this one out, it's more than worth it. Die-hards of the '90's online Arena shooters will appreciate it's run-and-gun gameplay and new players will enjoy the scalable and fair difficult curve as well as the entertaining narrative.			"

You can barely tell the enemies are shooting at you because there's no muzzle flash, no bullet trails, not a damn thing.

												After playing a few hours I can say that:Whoever called this an old school shooter should wake the **** up!No strafe run or backwards runningYou can run for like half a secondBullet sponge enemies, take way too many bullets so the only way to efficiently kill them is through environmental objectsNarrow hallways with no chance to explore or even get lostCheckpoint save system,  with really long battles between checkpoints.Removing crouch button does not make a game an old school shooter!You either make an old school shooter or a modern shooter. You do not take the worst things of different eras and combine them.Not recommended.			"

												I wanted this game to be good, I really did.  It looked really cool and had a lot of promise, but it just didn't deliver.  It's very pretty, yes, but that doesn't make a game any good. The best analogy I can make for the problem is that the character is grossly overweight, because these are some issues:A) He can't sprint more than 10 feet before having to catch his breath in between stuffing his face with mashed potatoes.B) He can't crouch down because then all of his bacon cheeseburgers will fall out of his trenchcoat.C) He can't stand on sloped surfaces without falling off, because he insists on carrying sticks of butter in his shoes for when the moment is right.D) He scrambles to pick up his donuts every time an explosion goes off next to him, causing significant screen shakingThis, on top of extremely confusing map design and enemies whose animations are erratic and jump from pose to pose, as well as frustrating enemies that can often kill you before you realize what's even going on, the game was really not enjoyable to play.

												*REVIEW IN PROGRESS*Not my style of FPS anymore.You get a story as a cut scene, but after that it's just a bunch of fast metal sh*t trying to kill you. You yourself should always be moving and shooting, jumping all around because you die somewhat fast even if you start to combo your weapons. If you like these kinds of games or are just bored one day w/ nothing else to play then sure buy it.I'll be going back to play on the days that I feel like murdering everything in sight. "

Product received for free
												Probably the most unpleasant FPS I've ever played.The game is super loud, can't even hear where enemies are coming from. It's a cacophony of noise.Motion blur which smears everything and constant screenshake for otherwise very anemic guns.Enemies are bullet sponges even on normal difficulty.At least I got to shoot enemies right from the beginning without the game beating me to death with cutscenes, but I didn't enjoy killing any of the first 3 types of enemies, so I don't think I'd enjoy any of the rest.I clicked ""received product for free"" since I played this via family sharing of my bro's library.

												Hated this game.What ultimately breaks it is the checkpoint system and lack of quick saves. As a PC-only game, it has no excuses...Checkpoints are positioned far and wide, after 5, maybe more waves of enemies. Downgrading difficulty results in warnings about losing progress on difficult badges, etc... This also means that if you find a secret, then die before checkpoint, which is almost certain, you will lose secret and will have to re-get it. Terrible design idea, as some secrets are hard to get! And, some areas have 3 secrets before a checkpoint, so you actually have to get all 3 then fight some goons, before next checkpoint hits. Everything about it is just awful.Other more minor points: gun upgrades are not interesting, bad. The graphics are not spectacular, but not horrible... Sounds are generic. Story is told through 2D drawings, which are bad. There are some voices/dialogue in the game, but it is generic. Go find this, we have to find that, chase this guy... Story is not compelling.This is one of the only games I haven't bothered to finish and was aggravated playing! All thanks to the lousy checkpoint system and lack of quick save.			"

												I might have been impressed by Hard Reset ten years ago, but it doesn’t hold up to today’s shooters. This is an extremely generic first person shooter that lacks many expected features of the genre. You can’t even duck, which should tell you something about how the game is meant to be played. It’s all mindless run and gun action. I wouldn’t mind so much if the game wasn’t so uninteresting. Blowing up wave after wave of the same robots is, simply put, boring. The cyberpunk environments are dull and repetitive, and the weapon loadout is quite limited. There is an upgrade system for the weapons and armor, but it’s a pain to navigate. Some of the upgrades are fun for a while, but they still don’t provide enough variety to hold my interest. The story is expectedly poor and primarily told through comic book style cutscenes. These cutscenes help hide the otherwise lengthy load times, but that means you can’t skip them. With a multitude of quality first person shooters to choose from, there’s no reason to waste any time with a game as simple and predictable as Hard Reset.			"

												The inspired art design can't make up for the repetitive and unengaging gameplay.The level design (geometry, textures, effects) is frequently beautiful, very Blade Runner, at times, very original, although strangely low-poly.  The advertisements in particular are great: an original take that preserves a very cyberpunk feel.  But that's the end of what's good about Hard Reset.There is little variety in enemies; what variety exists is largely about the size of their hitbox and what kind of weapon they use.  Every combat area is a predictably-sized arena with artificial sawtooths to prevent retreat, and doors that prevent continuing until all the bad guys are dead.  Many of the enemies have a lot more health than I personally find enjoyable.The protagonist's weapons lack a certain oomph, maybe because all ten(?) of them are supposed to be flavors of only two transforming weapons-- so for instance, your proximity mine uses effects that look an awful lot like your plasma gun.  An experience point system unlocks new weapons and upgrades, but of course encourages upgrades, which in turn discourages variety; meanwhile, the fact that there's only two kinds of ammunition prevents the authors from meaningfully using ammunition to prompt weapon switching.A lot of factors conspire to limit engagement with the game.  The voice acting sounds like the friends-and-family-of-the-devs style.  The story isn't the focus, of course, but what little exists doesn't help anything.  Occasional  trace-the-pipe puzzles and poor signposting wreak havoc with the pace.Overall, this plays like a very very high-quality mod for a game ten or fifteen years old.  Which is a little like, ""Excellent cinemetography, considering that it's made for public access cable.""  Might be of some interest for its take on cyberpunk, but it's not very engaging as a game.

Games like Red Faction 2 and FPS games around this time that weren't really sure what a console FPS was supposed to look like play pretty much like this. This is the worst era to recreate. Its not original or fun outside of the cool setting. But boring menial gameplay isn't going to keep me playing for the story here.			"

												So this is the ""tribute to old school shooters"", eh? This is more of an insult if anything. This shooter got nothing on the classics. It has huge balance issues. Enemies on the difficulty level ""Insane"" are bulletsponges. All of them. That's right, the smallest robots with ♥♥♥♥tons of HP come in big numbers and swarm your♥♥♥♥♥and all you can do is retreat & shoot. You might think that one can try to run ahead and use a better route? Too bad, the character you play with is extremely slow, the sprinting is useless, you only sprint for 2 seconds, WTF?! It's even worse than Call of Duty and I thought that was not possible. If you run towards the enemy, they slaughter you in seconds. Upgrades are way too important for a shooter like this, pick the wrong things and you won't get far. But how are you supposed to know what's ahead of you if you play it for the first time? By watching a Let's Play beforehand? Also, there are explosives EVERYWHERE. Those you use for the most part to kill enemies. But what if you shot something explosive and it destroyed everything else in a chain reaction and you got nothing left for the next wave of enemies? Yup, you are ♥♥♥♥ed. Also you gotta love the level architecture. There is a fence blocking your path. You can clearly see that all it would take to get past it is simply to crouch. But here comes another ""extra-challenge"": there is no crouch. Instead, he goes around and kills another ♥♥♥♥ton of enemies JUST TO GET TO THIS ONE ROOM AND PRESS A BUTTON. Lovely, that really is very oldschool. There is no feedback from your guns, enemies are much faster than you, they have better weapons than you and they can hit you from every angle possible. You are basically a tank with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ armor and weak weapons. Somewhat I don't remember anything similiar in the shooter genre from back then. Short version: it's not oldschool, it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game with extremely good looks. Flying Wild Hog somewhat learned from their mistakes by making Shadow Warrior 2013 a more enjoyable game, but they still kept the bulletsponges. Not a big deal there since you have a sword.			"

												20 mins after playing closed it because of motion sickness.Enemies are everywhere and you have to spend one damn magazine for every one of themshoot the enemies on the head or somewhere, there s no difference. thats why killing an enemies is more like ""chore""awful level design.upgrading system is just not for me.EDIT: ♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME.enemy hit radius is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. and these little wall-e like ♥♥♥♥ers  swarming you from everywhere.You cant crouch. Actually its not a big deal when you do your job right.but there s a gate like almost same with your height but no! you have to jump some obstacles to pass through. and developers clearly saying this. ""as you can see we didn t put crouching in this game and showing this to you here.""WTF why would anyone wants to put explosive things on their top of the doors? YES BECAUSE WHY NOT? you can sprint 3-4 seconds. we playing as heavy smoker 65 years old lad.you need cat like reflexes to avoid headbut attacks. you dont have any? well good luck with that because you gonna eat every single damage from charge attacks.i dont wanna waste one more second for this frustration. dont get this cancer.

												While this may not be the most exciting of FPS games. Hard Reset does manage to get a number of things right, good graphics,  interesting weapons, decent voice acting and a unique style of cutscene (although seen before) adds to the overall feel of the game. What it gets wrong is the on-rails level design and the the charcaters inabilty to crouch (its not 1990!!!). Other than that there is nothing really wrong with the game. For its price its a good bit of entertainment, I would love to see what the developers cook up next.			"

												Hard Reset is an intense first-person shooter that takes place in a futuristic cyberpunk envoirnment and city. To play it, you're going to want at least three things: A desire to shoot countless hordes of robots, patience of iron, and a pretty powerful graphics card. If you don't have one or more of these things, Hard Reset probably isn't for you.This game has a really awesome art style, both the beautiful enviornments that you play in, and the cutscenes that play at the beginning of a level. The cutscenes themselves play like a sci-fi comic book, which I think is really neat, though most of the time it doesn't feel like there's much story involved. The gameplay itself is oldschool right down to the bare bones, sort of a hybrid of painkiller, doom and serious sam. You'll engage in plenty of hardcore combat with all sorts of robots that appear throughout the levels and try to kill them by any means necessary, whether it be mowing them down with your weapons, or blowing up enviornmental hazards around them, ranging from barrels, electrical machines, cars...you get the idea.Probably one of the coolest features of Hard Reset is that, unlike most oldschool shooters, you don't actually collect new guns. Instead, you get to power up the weapons and gear the game starts you out with by collecting Nanos, then going to upgrade machines to select the upgrades you desire. For example, you can upgrade your assault rifle to be things like a shotgun and an rpg, and you can improve the quality of your armor and health, to name a few things. Nanos can be collected by killing enemies, looking throughout the levels, and finding secrets by looking high and low for them and blowing up walls.Even though I really like Hard Reset, I'll admit it's not for everyone---it can get rather frustrating at times, since enemies often appear in swarms really quickly and can often result in stupid deaths (though to be fair, I AM playing on insane difficulty), and the game does have very little story (mostly just kill machines and complete objectives). Very highly recommended for those who love intense oldschool gameplay and cyberpunk/sci-fi games, though. 3.5/5.0			"

												Oh to go back to the days of just wasting through baddies moving from checkpoint to checkpoint. This game has done wonders  to bring that feeling back, only now with a new coat of paint of todays tech to sweeten the deal. I suppose there is a story but i did not pay to much attention to it, I seemed to pay more attention to the surroundings. There are holo-ad signs( which can be used offensivly by shooting them) which give you a glimps of what might the inhabitants might have filled there days with. You run through city scapes filled with parked( or abandoned) cars ( which can be destroyed hurting you or enemies) , many nooks and crannies to root around in to find secrets, blimps and other air vehicles flying over head, and announcments looped through loud speakers further adding to the meat of the world. You have two weapons , or should i say weapon types; being that either one can be upgraded to have an added mode to it. the types are solid rounds and energy munitions; bothe can be upgraded to fill the rolls of straight shooter( solid : assault rifle with zoom secondary/ energy : pulse rifle with charge blaster secondary) close range crowd control ( solid : shot gun with multy shot burst secondary / energy : multi arc electricity emiter with stun burst for secondary). All can be upgraded at stations that are littered about levels, you must spend an upgrade point( gained by filling an upgrade bar to full by picking up packets from either downing baddies or finding them in secret areas) on either of the 2 gun types to unlock each of their modes and some slight upgrades for each of the modes, or a point on your armor un locking many bonuses like more health , more damage soak, or faster regen of sprint. even the upgrade stations do not take you out of the world, the staton's menu is diplayed as a holographic projection, and your cross hair turns into a curser for making selctions. If you want to back out of the upgrade menu just walk away from the station and continue mayhem. All in all this is some great adreniline pumping action with a very fleshed out world to blow stuff up in.			"

Many will criticize the story, but that's not what a game like this is about.  It's about moving fast, shooting constantly, and picking up shiny power-ups so that you can do it again in a few seconds.  It's that same addictive rush that we got from Doom and Duke Nukem 3D in the 90s, with the added polish that says ""This was made in 2013.""   For the price, you can't beat it.  10/10			"

The gameplay while simple at first glance hides a elegance of design in its user interface and weapon abilities. The plasma mortar upgrade is ALOT of fun.Levels contain secrets hidden in destructible areas or just under/inside objects in the world so you can hunt away for all the little nook and crannies.And its not exactly expensive especially right now so why not give it a shot? Old school style.I'm impressed.			"

												A pretty fun distopian FPS with very interesting weapons and gunplay.  Graphically this game is beautiful with a very sleek steam punkish art style.  The story is a bit meh but the actual gameplay and mechanics are pretty great. It can be a bit on the short side but at the price that they are asking it has a very good dollar per hour value;  but the campaign ends pretty abruptly, so consider yourself warned.  Also be warned that this game can be pretty HARD.  I would recommend playing your first play through on NORMAL even if you are pretty familiar with the FPS genre. Since it has New Game+ where you can retain your upgrades it will make the higher difficulties more manageable.  I highly recommend this game.			"

												Great old school type shooter. Reminds me a lot of Unreal or Quake type games. Would recommend to anyone who likes shooters.  Unfortunately, not a very long game.  Several long levels and two main bosses.  When it was over, I was actually surprised the credits rolled.			"

												While it's not a Duke3D or Doom 2 sort of ""old school"" Hard Reset definitely harkens back to Serious Sam, Painkiller, and even Quake 4. Beautiful environments, brutal enemies, and exotic upgradable weaponry system combine to deliver a very solid shooter. Health packs, skippable inbetween-level cutscenes and spawn triggers will bring you back to a different age of PC gaming. Personally, I purchased Hard Reset on sale and after finishing the game, feel guilty I didn't pre-order it. If you are looking for a challenge, play through this on Insane - while it feels impossible at times, the feeling of triumph you have after completing difficult sections of the game is uplifting. Secrets are abound in this game, some tougher to find than others, but each one gives you currency used to upgrade your weapons or unlock new ones.While it ends a bit abruptly, the ride there is full of gunplay. Some of the AI is simplistic, but the volume and strength of the enemies provide difficulty. Loved it.			"

												Forget sniping or cover (there is no crouch key) mobility is the key in this run and gun linear shooter. With a checkpoint system that opens the new area while sealing the last the levels feel more like a series of confined arena's packed with a mixture of heavily scripted spawns making for a very hectic style of arcade gameplay.With old school secret areas dotted around containing power ups, and intermittent upgrade points players can spend any nanites (experience) they're collected to upgrade different aspects of defense or offense. Such customisation will alter difficulty and play style allowing some longevity for re-runs.The graphics are nice and with an environment full of destructibles the game encourages the use of stategic misses to take out the enemy hordes in a more imaginative manner then simply clicking on them repeatedly. Another nice touch is the hit zone allocation to enemy allowing the player to strategically cripple or desperately reduce enemy constructs 1 part at a time, resulting in different animations and behaviour.The comic book style interludes add atmosphere and story to an otherwise shallow in-game experience.Summary: Good looking frantic fun with short bursts of fast and reflexive gameplay between bouts of leasurely safety.

												This was as good as I thought it would be. It;s well worth the price at the moment and it is FUN. Story is decent, pacing is good. It's taking me a bit to figure out the alt fires on various weapons. Imagine: I've got an EMP grenade launcher and I've still not used against the machines. I also can't seem to find crouch though the tutorial did give me a lesson on Jump. After E.Y.E - this was a welcome wash to the brain. Don't spend more than $20 - this is basically a well made mod in my eyes, but the Comic Book exposition puts it over the edge of that category. Looking forward to finishing this. Glad there was a sale - I've had this on my wish list ever since it was ready for Pre-Order.			"

												I received this game as a gift, and i was positively surprised by its quality, both in terms of gameplay and visuals. Moreover, the title was properly optimized, an aspect with a significant importance, considering the amount of enemies that are going to rush on the screen. If you are looking for a challenge and waves of brutal enemies which won't leave you alone unless you wipe them out once and for all, this is your game. Oh, and the storyline flows like a graphic novel, with very nice artworks and strips.			"

												Another sale has come around and that means there is no excuse to not buy this game. It is worth every cent and more.I fell in love with Hard Reset and flogged it to death, finding every secret, conquering every difficulty bar one (really who has that amount of time) and loved every minute of it. Classic shooter styling teamed with modern conveniences and a world ready to explode its a must have for a FPS fan.Plus the Dev's were so great and nice with helping me with my new unique problem that I had back in the day that they can do no wrong in my book.Support them! We need more Dev's like this...			"

												Almost instantly Hard Reset brought to mind all those great late-90's FPS games. With a modern touch and great attention to detail, especially with the level design and enemy types, this game is truly both a blast from the past and a blast of fresh air. It is a shame that an amazing game like this has gone so unnoticed. I certainly am very glad that I decided to give it a go. Cool noir-ish style in its story, some very intriguing sci-fi concepts, fantastic gunplay and a gun-focused progression system, this game doesn't really lack anything. The gun system is interesting, you have two guns which have multiple modes of firing and you upgrade them as you go, also unlocking more fire modes, I think this system works very well combined with all the different enemies you'll face. I especially liked shooting the bigger enemies with a shotgun or a railgun, and seeing all the armor plating fly away, yet the buggers kept coming - so many thrilling fights! The boss fights are very enjoyable, the levels have lots of destructible environment and last but not least; this game has a lot of secret places - just like good old FPS games used to have. If you are a FPS fan, you should definitely play this one through.			"

												This is an interesting game with a cool art style. The soundtrack is a cool Techno inspired sound, the graphics are a bit neon sporting bright red, blue, and green. In between fighting the story unfolds through comic book pages, similar to how Max Payne worked. It has a bit of a learning curve with some depth to the upgrade options between your weapons and character. Boss fights are a little tedious as they are the ""new, old school"" as I call it with a throw back to old console games where you shoot the glowing bit until it falls off. All in all not a bad game, worth $5 or $10 bucks.Tips: Play on Normal, this game is brutal on Hard...I played on Hard and got super frusterated a bunch of times.Upgrade your CLN and NRG weapons. Learn to switch between the CLN #1 (Rifle), CLN #2 (Shotgun), NRG #1 (forget the name) and NRG #3 (Mortar), and CLN #4 (RPG). I found that a combo of CLN #3 and NRG #3 was my best way to take down most things quickly.			"

												An excellent hark back to more traditional styled First Person Shooters. While the game is a little repetitive in a short campaign with no multiplayer component at all, the gunplay is exciting throughout and the puzzles are nicely designed, and the game looks excellent to boot, with some impressive graphical effects combined with a Blade Runner-esque art design. And honestly seeing as games like Modern Warfare series can get away with 5 hour campaigns for 10 times your money, this game is well worth the price tag. Score: 8/10			"

												A couple of hours playing this and I am having a great time. A really nice cyberpunk setting and despite the fact that I am using a 3 year old graphics card at the moment and there is a hell of a lot going on visually it is running beautifully.I very much get the impresion this is a game that knows what it is and is not trying to be something it isn't. It is basically a twitch shooter with loads of bad guys. ok robots, and loads of shooting. Yes it is a corridoor shooter but that is not always a bad thing and unlike a lot of games it is not pretending to be anything else.I love big open world sandpit games like Farcry and Skyrim and first person rpg shooters being a huge Deus Ex fan (I refuse to acknowledge the second one as a Deus Ex game it would be too painfull ). However I also like a good old style shooter where I can just dive in for an hour or two and blow the hell out of everything that moves and to me that is exactly what this is.  They are not east to do well, just look at the abomination that was Duke Nukem Forever,  and this one has been done well and is fun.If you want great story and character development forget it there isn't either. However if you want a good fun fps with a great graphical feel that knows exactly what it is and does it well buy and have fun. If you look at what this developer has gone on to do since with the new Shadow Warrior you can see they have a real understanding of the genre.Playing this takes me back to the likes of Duke Nukem 3D, the origional Shadow Warrior and Serious Sam with his BFG (We all know the F stood for Friendly, honest...) So lock and load, hold down the trigger and send those bots to that great scrapyard beyond the mechanical veil.			"

												Bought the game on the Christmas Steam sale. I am really surprised. It puts me back in the DOOM and QUAKE days. What is refreshing is that each weapon is unlocked through the use of an upgrade terminal and each weapon is within the two starting weapons you use. They're kind of like multipurpose weapons. They even have transformation animations! It is not as scary as doom or quake, the robots don't give off a ""horror"" vibe. They look like those robots people strap weapons on in an arena. For what it is, the graphics are great, the gameplay intense and bullet blazing! Just remember to apply combos between your weapon sets for maximum carnage!			"

Hard Reset was one of those games I didn't like at first. But then I loved it.I tried the game out back when it was released and it just didn't click with me. But I went back to it and I must say it is a very enjoyable old-school shooter with some new Ideas that may not be revolutionary but keep the game from getting boring.The Weapons are fun and the upgrade system is rewarding since you get a new ""function"" for your multipurpose weapons almost every few minutes throughout the entire game. There are many weapons to choose from so everyone should find something to their liking. You bascially have two wepons, a standard rifle/shotgun/missile launcher etc. and an energy weapon with a bunch of different modes ranging from plasma blaster to railgun. You can switch between these two wepons at anytime by pressing Q/E and switch between the modes using the mouswheel. It can however be a little bit difficult to switch between all these different weapons on the fly, and modes on the same weapon don't differentiate themselves from eachother much. This can lead to frustration sometimes. I really have to give the game credit for it's level design though. Every new environment looks different from the last and the levels are constructed in a way that's challenging, but you never really get lost. The levels are also stuffed with details, most of which are also destructible. The vistas in this game are stunning and even the skyboxes are a filled with details. It's also got some nice lighting effects going on. I played it with the DLC and must say the game probably would have been a bit short without it, and sadly even with the DLC the story feels very lackluster and doesn't really come to any sort of conclusion, so don't expect a great story. Other than that though I feel Hard Reset is well worth it's money if you're looking for a straight up shooter with a nice cyber-punk esthetic.			"

												If you like to shoot some badguys, this is a game for you. It features some good new weapons and short story line.The graphics are really good and there are some nice views in the game. The story is told, so no need to read pages.You can choose your game difficulty, which is also something I really like about games.Every level contains a lot of secrets, which was challenging me to find them. A lot of things can be destroyed by your weapons, which is also pretty cool.The bad thing for me was that you cannot really surprise your enemies, they always spawn so it's impossible to sneak upon them. When you get attacked close by, it's really hard to see where and what you are shooting at.It's also hard to switch weapons. I like to start with long range weapons, but the enemies are faster than I'm able to switch my weapon to close combat.			"

												The people at ""Flying Wild Hog"" studios set out to make a cyber-punk shooter with fun gun-play mechanics....and they did it! 1)The overall experience: it's fast, action packed and simply fun. A person, who's childhood was based in the 90s, will notice that this game is heavily inspired by the old-school classics like Doom, Quake, Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior - your health is displayed on your lower left corner along with your ammo and shield capacity. If you are not careful those attributes will get depleted and you'll simply die with no ammo or health.  2)Digging a little deeper into the game - the game's story takes a backseat to it's gameplay. You are equipped with two guns which transform into several types and they can be upgraded throughout the game. This is the only modern mechanic implamented into the game. The game is powered by RoadHog Engine - there are impressive lighting effects, physics and decent textures, but the areas that you will visit are not verried. You'll visit the same industrial cyber-punk vistas, but from different angles. 3) Final Verdict - Hard Reset dosen't set out to re-imagine the genre. It is a familiar shooter, that brings back good memories of the fun I used to have while playing the shooters of the 90s! A great nostalgia trip and challenge for the modern gamer! I give Hard Reset a 8/10! :)			"

												The intensity of this game reminds me of old-school shooters.  Fast-paced play and a limited number of enemy types.  But with hordes of enemies, you'd better be accurate and thoughtful because some sometimes you'll need to aim for the head, other times you'd better aim for the explosive next to them.  Sure, you only get two weapons but the upgrade options are interesting and you'll never see such an explosive environment in any other game.			"

												Absolutely loving this game.  I finally fired it up after trying to get into it a few times.  Once you get through the first couple levels, the game takes off.  Insane graphics quality.  If you're an old school FPS guy, this game is perfect.  Mass enemies, simple extreme weapons.  Every fight requires multiple weapon types.  (You can't just roll through the game with a rocket launcher)  Massive bosses are indeed massive.  It's fast action, with amazing graphics, and awesome sound.  This game should be well known as a solid, inspired and totally fun shooter.  I am so glad I gave it another shot.  It'll be one of the few games I've finished in recent memory.			"

												One of the must UNDER-rated games on Steam.  Wild Hogs has quickly become one of my favorite studios.  Not only do they produce really fun, interesting games, but they're solid members of the gaming community, respond quickly to issues and are dedicated to PC gaming.Between this and Shadow Warrior, I believe Wild Hogs is a game developer to watch.  How many companies can say that they've never produced a clunker.I would love to see what they'd produce with a really big budget.  I heartily recommend Hard Reset if you like serious First-Person Shooter games.  It reminds me of an updated version of old school games like Unreal Tournament.  It will get your heart pounding.  Be sure to kick the difficulty up if the game seems to easy for you.  It makes a big difference.			"

												Hard Reset is an FPS for those who might want to see what one of those more old-fashioned FPS games would be like if they were made today. Your character can take a few shots, the enemies are varied and the bosses intimidating, the weapon selection is very varied, the gameplay relies on the important gameplay mechanics rather than scripted sequences, there's no cover-based gameplay to be seen and furthermore, so many devious secrets in the levels that you'll absolutely burn ourself out if you try looking for them all.The gameplay is meaty, fast-paced and overall well polished. This might be Flying Wild Hog's first game, but some of the developers' experience really shows, as part of the team originally developed Painkiller			"

												Without a doubt, if you are a fan of old school first person shooters, Hard Reset will hit you right in the nostalgia. Side-scrolling galore, straight-up bullet storms (no pun intended), and huge, monsterous bosses. The game has an awesome sci-fi/dystopian set piece. And man - this game is challenging. You are often pitted against an army of robots in corriders - relegating strafing to mere slamming against walls.Despite the strong points of the game, I feel that the makers did not adequately fill the environment. Enemy-types are sparse despite the add-on: You basically face (1) two-legged robots with 3 variations, (2) foot soldier robots with 3 variations, and (3) two ""gorilla-type"" robots with two variations. There is no variety of weapons per say, but rather weapon-alternative fires. The greatest downfall of this game is the story: Despite googling it and reading the message boards, it appears no one has a firm grasp of what is going on. Comic-esque cut scenes do their best to present something that resembles a plot but fall short of cohesiveness.I am really on the wall about whether or not I would recommend this game. If you are inclined towards old school FPS's, get it. If you fall in to lulls really quick due to repetitive enemy types and an abscence of a story , I'd avoid this game.			"

												What can I say about Hard Reset: Extended Edition?Its a great throwback to the 'run and gun' games of the past, I personally think Serious Sam's latest effort does a better job in that regard but Hard Reset has something Serious Sam doesn't... Upgrades. New weapons can be unlocked and upgraded by finding 'Nanites' that are scattered around a level, of course most of the high value amounts are found in secret areas.I greatly enjoyed playing through the game and was really enjoying the plot, right up to the point where it just cuts off abruptly. There is potential for a sequel but who knows if thats even in the works. Take a look at Rage for a great example of wasted potential in regards to a continued story.Between some of the levels (I was going to say all but thats not the case) you're treated to a semi-animated comic book to explain the plot. This is a touch that I loved because it gives the game a greater feeling of depth and you want to explore the world this story is set in. Sadly this is where the game falls flat, while playing I found my character getting stuck on invisible walls and not being able to jump over or climb on things that I really should have been able to. It broke the immersion of the game quite badly especially since finding the aforementioned secrets quite often means having to explore the world around you, increasing the likelihood of running into these issues.I would recommend this game, for some nice 'run and gun' fun. But don't expect anything too deep and try not to be upset by the abrupt ending. I really hope that Flying Wild Hog create a sequel to this rather than let it die off.			"

												I recommend this game for those who are interested in finding a Quake-like game. This game was extremely fun, if not challenging. A lot of people can't keep up with how challenging it is, but for those looking for a hard shoot em up, this is your game. The gameplay is extremely fun, where you collect nano machines to upgrade your weapons/combat capabilities as you continue on your way through Bezoar City. The way you switch weapons on the fly is also pretty convenient, without having to go through a weapon wheel to find what weapon you're looking for... your weapons carry ALL the modifications you upgrade. The storyline is a bit lackluster.. tons of potential to be had, but not executed as well as i would have hoped. The graphics are amazing and really put you in the world... very atmospheric and the ambience fits just right in the cyberpunk universe. The music is hit and miss, where the battle music got heavily annoying after a few hours.. but the overall scores being played as you traversed the robotic wasteland were wonderful and verily eery during some parts. I loved the experience and i definitely recommend it to anyone in the market for such a title.			"

												This game has a LOT of charm. You start out with two weapons, which are the only two weapons you'll have for the entire game. However, these two weapons have 5 modes each, granting you a total of 10 weapons! Also, you're usually better off using the enviroment to kill the hordes of oncomming foes, since you simply don't have enough ammo to go around! On top of this new way of thinking, you got brilliant graphics, boss battles, and comic-book video sequences to tell the story! I often found myself taking a break from the whole ""massacre all the very awesomely constructed machines trying to claw your face off"" to enjoy the view. Yes, enjoy the view! When you stare off in the horizon of a level, it just seems to go on forever. Check it out, see for yourself!			"

												Edit: I am doing something I meant to take care of a long time ago, and that is revisit my rating of this game. In the end the game does what it sets out to do well and I ended up going back and giving it a THIRD chance and....third time is the charm. The game is a little clunky (not in controls just some odd mechanics and level layout) a little basic, but old school run and gun is what it does very well. Some of the game challenge is a little bit of cheap design but, looking back, that is pretty old school ha. Below is my negative review for the sake of honestly. Considering how much I loved Shadow Warrior by the same studio I was thrilled to see this go on Flash Sale here on Steam. Well. I'm certainly not thrilled anymore and deleted the game from my library. The entire strategy of level design found in Hard Reset can be summarized through ""put em' in a tiny room with a bunch of bad guys, ya, that would be hard right?"". Sure. It's tough but not because the people that made the game are clever. An entire game like this wouldn't have been tolerated as a gamers oh so sacred and nostalgia protected classic and they shouldn't be tolerated in modern games either. Nothing about this game is a throwback honestly and is just fairly inept. Besides the pretty graphics, man they sure are pretty. But it's just over all pretty terrible and a major let down. For 3.74 I'm not angry, just disappointed. Pick up Shadow Warrior instead if you're looking for a ""retro FPS with a touch of modern design"".			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine  PLEASE NOTE: I recommended this game with some exceptions, overall if the game did not live up to just a tiny expectation, I would not have recommended it at all, so please read the review carefully if you are thinking of buying/playing this game Hard Reset is developed by Flying Wild Hog, the people behind Shadow Warrior and its upcoming sequel. Hard Reset was developed before Shadow Warrior and you can tell that the company did not have as much of a bigger budget as Shadow Warrior didThe story basically follows a dystopian world where robots have taken over by a sophisticated A.I., you play a major known as Fletcher, throughout the story you have to try and find out the reasons why the robots have turned against the humans and stop those who are responsible. The story is very cliche and does follow what many other sci-fi films back in the day managed to achieveThe environments are absolutely stunning, and the lighting effects in particular really make the enviornments come alive. The explosions also play a big role in Hard Reset and really make the game more explosive in its action, however, even though I have a PC that can run it on ultra settings, I did suffer with some minor frame rate drops when there was a lot of action going about. Now, I don't know what the developers where trying to go through the environments, but the game really reminded me of Blade Runner, a sci-fi thriller classic. The high rise buildings, the flying cars and that Chinese/Japanese (sorry can't tell the difference) adevertising on large blimps, I think the developers where heavily inspired by Blade Runner when they were designing Hard ResetTalking about game performance, this game does suffer with poor game performance. Sometimes the game freezes monetarily even in heavy combat areas, this may be due to the high amounts of enemies and explosive effects taking placeThe A.I., the game's difficulty changes drastically, especially in the last bit of the main story and then the rest of the DLC story, I first played on Normal difficulty and it was so annoying that I died so many times that I had to lower it to the Easy difficulty which lowered the amount of times I died and these robots sure do have precision aim shooting, because in Hard Reset they have precision aim shooting!The music and sound effects were okay but what really made me happy was that whilst playing, it did remind me of Blade Runner quite a lot!Like previously said, you will die, a lot, thankfully there is a fair checkpoint system in the game. The voice acting was bad and I mean really bad. You can tell that in Shadow Warrior they had a bigger budget because at least in that game the voice acting was good, in Hard Reset, they were really bad. The only good performance I would say was from the professor, nobody elseThe gunplay is okay, nothing special though. I think the game was also heavily inspired by old shooters like DOOM, as it does try to bring in that same formula to Hard ResetLastly, what really made me not want to continue playing was the re-use of the enemies. I don't know how many times I saw the same enemies over and over again every single time through my whole playthrough. It really made me not want to continue playing... Plus, what is up with the endings!? The main story's ending is really bad and ends on a huge cliffhanger leaving you helpless as to what has just happened and what will happen, thankfully Flying Wild Hog made an extended edition which includes the Exile DLC for free which continues the main game. But even that ending, it has that ending of, ""Oh, don't worry, everything will be explained in due time"", and just ends like that...I had fun playing Hard Reset, even though it did have its fair share of problems here and there, but on the whole, it was a really good action game. I wouldn't recommend Hard Reset for its full asking price as I feel it does not satisfy me to pay full price, but if it is in a sale, price drop, etc... I would definitely recommend you buying it, if you love sci-fi or Blade Runner or both like me RECOMMENDED :)  "

												This game is a decent straight forward run and gun shooter seemingly styled after serious sam and doom. The campaign takes 6-10 hours to beat first time through and is fairly entertaining although the story is lacking with cutscenes that often substitute  swearing for actual plot dialogue. The gameplay is solid though; different enemies that require certain strategies or guns to fight effectively and up to 10 different guns all with their own small upgrades. Good not great, argueably worth $15 but better if it goes on sale. Overall 6/10			"

All of which can be upgraded (+suit upgrades) and get a 2ndary fire and 'that' is where the game differs.

IntroductionI wanted to play a shooter again, it had been a while. And here came Hard Reset on a sale, looking like a shooter with cool weapons, retro-gameplay and fancy graphics in a dark megacity setting. Sounded like something I would enjoy.Gameplay and DifficultyI completed the game on Hard and when this game says Hard, it means HARD. I rarely finished a level with under 2-5 deaths, some arenas cost me close to 10 deaths, because I either didn't choose the right weapon upgrades and consequently struggled, or I simply got overwhelmed by a surprise wave of enemies. Hard Reset is pretty simple in terms of game mechanics, the gameplay could be summarized like this:Enter arena. Run around in circles, relentlessly firing, dodging and switching between your poorly performing weapons, while trying to run from hordes of almost endlessly spawning mobs until you run out of ammo and powerups. Die. Try again. Finally beat arena. Proceed through corridor. Get ambushed. Enter next arena. Repeat. Occasionally you have to press buttons to proceed, that's really all there is to it.I'm usually the type for deep and rich gameplay, thinking up clever solutions, progressing tactically. I like games that make you think. This game is nothing like that and I'm aware this sounds like a full-fledged rant so far, BUT: what it does, it does well. The mechanics in place are well balanced, sprinting, jumping, shooting, environment damage, powerup placement and strength, enemy strength vs. weapon damage. It all was balanced with the grand scheme of gameplay in mind. Some arenas feel a bit overdone, the developers just love to throw in waves and waves of mobs, probably to extend the playtime a little more. However, once you learn what enemy types to expect in which quantities and where the powerups are, things get more manageable. And still, each mob does crazy damage, there is little room for mistakes. Mobs also have tons of health and the big boys take quite a bit ammo to take down. Smaller enemies come in larger quantities regularly and still each have quite a bit of health, so you're often better off using the big calibers with AoE for small enemies as well. Enemies mostly feel like bullet sponges - and that's okay to make the game work as it is designed, given the design of arenas and the circumstances of powerups etc. The problem is that the game just doesn't give you the feeling of real weapon impact which is a big factor of fun in most shooters. Not so much here.What's fun on the other hand is the management of space to run, retreating into the right corners, using the right weapons, dodging in the right moments, leaving powerups on the ground until you actually need them, it's all enough to consider to keep the game interesting.Boss battles are well done as a combination of getting swarmed by waves of distractive mobs and having to hit special zones on the boss's body that need to be destroyed to take the boss down.I like the AI in this game because mobs seem to cooperate to take you down. Mobs often run around you through adjacent corridors in order to attack you from all sides. Other than that, the AI is reasonably predictable once you've observed each mob's behaviour.Level designThe level design overall is pretty linear and one-dimensional. Visually most of the game takes place in a dark Blade Runner'esque megacity, most of which is beautifully built. Unfortunately it gets repetitive after a while and leaves you longing for a change. It's not until the Exile DLC expansion that the overall setting changes to a brighter scrapyard wasteland, which to me was a welcome change at that point.Many level elements return quite often, like forklifts blocking paths, while lifting the fork allows you to progess, or optionally powering up or down button panels to open doors. A little more variety wouldn't have hurt here.Quite often you'd bump into invisible walls blocking progress or keeping you from jumping over obstacles. This can be quite tedious when there's only one supposed way to get to a secret, but there's no way to tell where there's a hole in the invisible wall.VerdictSo how does that add up? Let's take a look at the pros and cons:*Pros*+ Graphics are really good, performance is sublime for the visual quality+ Sound is amazing+ Good soundtrack (with a few exceptions)+ Immersive dark and gritty atmosphere+ Fast-paced non-stop action, bug- and glitch-free+ Smooth user interface+ Motivating upgrade system (at least until midgame, in endgame all the necessary weapons and defensive stats are maxed out and there's no more need to upgrade)+ Interesting and tough boss battles, really gets you on your toes+ Good AI - enemy groups split up and try to attack from all sides, even sometimes taking the longer path around an obstacles to sneak at you from behind*Cons*- Often repetitive and easily predictable level design- Few enemy types- Weak weapons (or too tanky enemies)- Often unnecessarily prolonged battles - too many waves of mobs- Some weapons are useless - I almost exclusively used the RPG, Mortar and Railgun and did just fine. Assault Rifle and Plasma Rifle never got used anymore when other weapons were unlocked- Weapon switch times. This game requires frequent weapon switches and there are a few occasions where you just don't have the time to switch weapons. So if you're not prepared, you getting swarmed and you die.- Less than stellar German translation and synchronization- Some annoying songs in the soundtrack- Invisible walls, often annoying placement of N.A.N.O. (currency) requiring you to make fiddly jumps. I sometimes couldn't be bothered.So, do I recommend this game? Overall, yes! Buy it if you don't mind the simplistic gameplay and if you have a high-ish frustration tolerance. Do not buy it if you don't like arena battles and the circumstance of being constantly ambushed, surrounded and swarmed.Overall rating: 79/100			"

												An attempt at a new-oldskool shooter throwback to the glory days of yore. Somewhat failed in my opinion, it took too many of the bad aspects instead of the good ones, and most of the modern aspects were the bad ones too (only implemented worse than usual). Despite all that it still manages to be a fun mindless shooter when you ignore the terrible voice acting and pretense of a plot. Worth picking up on sale/for cheap for sure.			"

												If you like straightforward balls to the wall shooters like Painkiller and Serious Sam, then you will love Hard Reset. It's short, with an average playtime of only 3-4 hours, but the game makes up for it with beautiful futuristic environments and crunchy, fast paced gameplay. Chunks of debris fly off enemies as you shoot them with your various weapons, and the environment is satisfyingly destructable. This is a relatively low budget game that definitely holds its own against the current AAA titles. I can't wait to see what Flying Wild Hog can do with a bigger budget.			"

												I got Hard Reset on sale. I purchased it because I liked the Blade Runner vibe in the screenshots and trailers. Having just finished it, I can honestly say I would not have been disappointed even if I had purchased it at full price. Hard Reset is a run and gun that does not reinvent the wheel, but what it does, it does very well. The graphics and level design were great. The difficulty level, while at times frustrating, was neither too easy nor too difficult.  When it seemed like I had died 10 times in the same fight, I would step away from the game, but its fun, and I always came back for more. The weapons system is very simple - two highly upgradable guns. The upgrades were great - some of them more than others (smart gun and RPG were my favorites.) You can also upgrade the health system in a variety of ways. Its not overly complex, but it mixes things up a bit.Some people have complained about the repetitive look of things and the recycling of enemies. I actually really loved the art design of the game (the more human than human signs were a nice touch), especially in the Exile portion of the game, which has a completely different color palette than the main section. I didn't think the number of varying enemies was any less interesting than in say, Doom or Half-Life. I learned, as the game went on, how to handle different kinds of enemies with the weapons at my disposal.Another complaint I have seen is that Hard Reset is ""story lite."" This is true, but not to the extent I feared. The story/ concept is delivered in a format that mimics a comic book (which I thought was kind of cool), and while it isn't overly deep and doesn't have much in the way of character development, it compliments the game sufficiently to keep my interest. More than anything it serves to break up the ""chapters/ levels"" of the game and give context to the environment. This is NOT Deus Ex: Human Revolution, but its not just an arcade shoot-em-up either. I clocked about 29 hours before I was done with the main game and Exile DLC, but I went back a few times to try to find the ""secrets"" and to raise my level scores. These small elements give the game some limited replayability, and the overall length of the game is fantastic for the price. I have seen some say that it seems to drag on, but honestly, for my money, I would rather have a longer game than a shorter one, especially these days. Best of all, I had zero issues with this game - no crashes, no freezes, nothing. It just played right away and worked straight through to the end. When I would get swamped with enemies at times, my frame rate would drop, but given the sheer amount of activity on the screen this never suprised me or inhibited my play. Its relatively rare these days to find a game that isn't half broken on release, but Hard Reset is on that short list for me. So, all in all, kudos to the developers for making a GREAT run and gun game. I was thoroughly entertained and definitely recommend Hard Reset.			"

												I didn't like it but I can't give it a red thumb because those kind of shooters aren't meant for me. So consider my recommendation as a ""meh"" more than a yes.If you like shooters like Serious Sam, Shadow Warrior, etc... where you're put into small areas to fight (mainly) melee monsters you might enjoy it. If you're more into games like Half-Life 2 where you have to crouch behind obstacles to avoid taking fire, aiming the head of enemies, etc... you might want to skip this game.Pros:- Awesome atmosphere- Nice cutscenes- Good option menuCons:- Very hard to see what's going on- Monsters just run towards you- Repetitive- You're stuck with two guns (you can modify them but that means you'll mostly play with the same two weapojns for the whole game)			"

												As a sucker for fast paced shooters a la Painkiller... Hard Reset does the job! Not only does it have an enjoyable visual style with loads of neon lighting, it has a flawless gameplay mechanic that never gets old. Not the longest game (6-8 hours depending on the difficulty, which can get pretty challenging) but it offers plenty of extreme shooter fun. Not as mindless as a Painkiller or Serious Sam and definitely in a different ball park style-wise. If you're anything BUT a fan of those games, it's wise to skip this one as well.			"

Strong and intense audio direction as well as solid visual art with pretty light(n)ing effects. Not so much ""Cyberpunk"" though, the presentation delivers more ordinary dark future SciFi, since the game doesn't reflect much of what would make it ""Cyberpunk"" due to its staging. However, this title delivers what the name promises. I'd recommend it now that they've fixed pretty much every minor problem that was in the demo and in the release version.			"

												This game has a LOT of charm. You start out with two weapons, which are the only two weapons you'll have for the entire game. However, these two weapons have 5 modes each, granting you a total of 10 weapons! Also, you're usually better off using the enviroment to kill the hordes of oncomming foes, since you simply don't have enough ammo to go around! On top of this new way of thinking, you got brilliant graphics, boss battles, and comic-book video sequences to tell the story! I often found myself taking a break from the whole ""massacre all the very awesomely constructed machines trying to claw your face off"" to enjoy the view. Yes, enjoy the view! When you stare off in the horizon of a level, it just seems to go on forever. Check it out, see for yourself!			"

												After 3 hours of playing, and managing to get to the fourth level, I can say that this game is definitely not an average shooter. It is difficult and requires swift movement and weapon switching for the situation at hand. It is well-optimized, only losing FPS on cramped areas with lots of explosives. It also features a brutal checkpoint system that CAN and WILL punish you for failing to observe your surroundings and dying stupid deaths. It is also king enough to save right before encountering a new enemy type so you can learn the strategy without needing to wade through robots again.Secrets are scattered throughout the levels and can require out of the box thinking, platforming, and use of environmental hazards to reach.Gameplay: 8/10Visuals: 9.7/10Replay-Value: 5/10Overall: 8.7/10			"

												This is a really fantastic game, imo.  I love the sci-fi setting - environments, robotic enemies, weapon selection, etc.  The upgrade system is pretty cool and you can get upgrades fairly quickly if you spend a little time searching for hidden loot.  It's mechanically a very solid and smooth FPS - easy to control with no noticable bugs that I've seen.  The graphics still look beautiful even though I had to turn the settings down a bit.  In terms of difficulty, I would say it's a bit harder than most games I've played in the genre.  I'm not great at FPS games - I generally play on normal difficulty but I found myself having to play this one on easy, which I consider to be about right for me.While I think the retail price of $15 is totally fair, I got it on sale for $2.24 so I would recommend waiting for another sale.  Overall, a great game that I highly recommend to FPS fans, especially if you like the dystopian sci-fi setting.  That being said, there is an updated version, Hard Reset Redux, in the works.  No word on a release date or price but you may want to wait for it, especially if you have a system that can fully take advantage of the improved graphics.			"

												This was a surprise, it was more enjoyable than I expected. A bit dated, but definitely enjoyable. I do have critique.. such and the complete inability to crouch. Which is very.. very annoying (Limits like that are just dumb) It is also quite linear, and there is very little exploration to speak of. It is essentially a shooting gallery. The weapons are ok. The sound is so so, a bit on the thin end, and thy don't really feel like they have much impact. And once you get the electric mortar, you pretty much don't need much else. But all of those a really minor things, and don't really prevent me from enjoying the game. The graphics are dated like I said, but still OK. The story is like a cheap tv show, so don't expect much from it. at $2 when I got it on sale, it is an absolute steal. But the ordinary $14 (rounded up) is OK too. It is light fun to have on a boring day. Recommended!			"

Jumping really sucks in this game. And not being able to crouch is kinda weird... sometimes you have the feeling that you can go through some places but you can't because you have wooden legs and you can't bend them or something.

Its about having good reflexes while battling hordes of emeries.Looks good, runs well an overall solid game if a little too simplistic. If you like your FPS's you should get this "

												An attempt at a new-oldskool shooter throwback to the glory days of yore. Somewhat failed in my opinion, it took too many of the bad aspects instead of the good ones, and most of the modern aspects were the bad ones too (only implemented worse than usual). Despite all that it still manages to be a fun mindless shooter when you ignore the terrible voice acting and pretense of a plot. Worth picking up on sale/for cheap for sure.			"

												I wanted to love this game, I really did.  It was made by a new company with people who respect PC gamers.  However, even if it is a pure game, undefiled by contard hands, I can't overlook its flaws.  Primarily, it's story, settings, and charectars are utterly slapdash.  I wrote more coherant stories with better dialogue when I was in grade school.  They really dropped the ball, the story is all but incomprehensible, and the game's objectives don't make a whole lot of sense either.The gunplay is nice, if nothing else, but once you have railgun and shotgun, you don't need too much else.  They fixed the weapon switching taking too long at least.  It does feel like there are too few enemy types.The graphics, of course, are drop dead goregeous, and everything runs smooth as butter.  It's a visually apealing game, if not a terribly complex one.All in all, I had fun with it, but I can't in good consience reccomend it until it drops to at least $15.			"

												Hard Reset caught some flack for being a relatively short game with a small variety of enemies that don't do anything more than the one or two actions they make.HOWEVER!  These are the only real problems these reviewers actually have with the title.  To them, I say ""Phooey"".  Hard Reset is a wonderful arcade-y shooter game that's focused on obliterating a lot of robots while moving, shooting and running constantly through a very well designed futuristic city.  It's incredibly linear with the occasional small alleyway or fence that hides some bonus points, but this is perfect for how the game is meant to be.  It keeps you going and shooting, and the enemies get varied at the correct times, and they spawn in the perfect places to make for a challenging and fun experience.  I love the world, I love the feel, I love the art (especially the city), and I love the game.Quick note:  The story is extremely weak, but the story shouldn't be the focus of a game of this type anyway.  Solid 8 or 9/10.  There is NO reason to not pick this title up if Steam throws it on sale (which happens quite often).			"

												TLDR; Excellent run-and-gun game, but I felt let down a bit by the ending, it felt decidedly 'unepic'.Well, OK it was a ""Walk cautiously-and-gun"" game. I've played this game twice, now. If you play it on  Easy, you'll see an arena type area, and go ""here we go again and run in"" If you play it on normal, you will see an arena area and go ""oh no I'm going to get smashed again and try and sneak past (not gonna happen)""Some of the 'unique' things about this game, You can't crouch (whatdya MEAN I can't get through there)there is limited ammo (slowly recharges over time, but plenty of pickups from fallen bots)BUT there is no reload. all your ammo is in one big clip! it's so great!The Smart Gun on the NRG is OP Forget your rifle, max this as fast as you can, then go for you rifle's rocket launcheryou only get 2 guns, but they get a snotload of alt fire modesRPG elements through choosing what to upgrade... either gun, and choose from a variety of mods, or buff yourself with extra health / armour/ scanner/radar/medkit etc (I suggest getting the money-raqdar ASAP... before you get any gun upgrades)Gameplay tends to be tight corridors that lead into arena style rooms.Annoying thingsYou can't crouchinvisible walls. If they don't want you to go through there yet, you can't parkour it.arena battles, doors auto lock until you finish the fight, even though they work perfectly before and after the fight.the jumping/platforming bits (mostly for secrets) felt wrong. your character's movement through these sections is hard, as you move so fast by default, and no quicksave (it auto saves before every arena, and right before any parkour-to-your-death bits)The story was a huge let down thus far, even though it's open for a sequel, it felt like they finished in the middle of the story. Killing the boss didn't feel like taking down the baddies, merely  getting him out of the way so you could get through the next gate. (compounded the storyline)things i likedSecrets are REALLY worth taking the time to find. that extra cash allows you to build up your weapons much, much faster.without them, you might only have half the stuff unlocked by the end boss fight.on Normal, I was panicking about every corner, setting off the next wave of enemies.Oh, that Smart gun.you have real speed in this game, making a truely run-gun experience. Similar to Shadow Warrior (If you've played that, It's by the same guys, but you'd know that by all the references to HR in SW)the -nomagazine mechanic in the gunsgraphically beautifulThe physics engine feels spot-on most of the time (the way stuff gets thrown / lands / etc)With hints on, you can focus largely on gameplay, especially as some of the 'puzzles' can be otherwise obscure.So, A good looking FPS shooter with no quicksave (not a bad thing), RPG elements,  engaging and tactical combat (different enemy types are wiped out best by different weapon mods), and a few quirks. It took me 15h to clock it on easy (100% secrets), I have only got partway through on Normal so far. "

												This game is pretty cool!  It is a Future Man Vs Machine FPS game.  The graphics are awesome and the way things blow up with peices going every where is even better.  The controls are good, the lighting is good, and best of all ~ the gameplay is pretty fun.The only downfall is that it ended after 4 hours and I wish the game had more effective weapons.  Once I got the smart gun I pondered why would I use anything else unless i was surrounded by tons of little bots.  The set up will remind you a bit of Serious Sam or PainKiller ~ because everytime you pick up goodies or cross a border into a new room.... expect to get jumped by robots.Better than I expected and worth the price tag.  A word of warning ~ do not buy this game expecting some awesome story or if you prefer shooting people.  In this game you never actually see another moving person and you only fight robots in furturistic areas with futuristic guns.			"

												I didn't like it but I can't give it a red thumb because those kind of shooters aren't meant for me. So consider my recommendation as a ""meh"" more than a yes.If you like shooters like Serious Sam, Shadow Warrior, etc... where you're put into small areas to fight (mainly) melee monsters you might enjoy it. If you're more into games like Half-Life 2 where you have to crouch behind obstacles to avoid taking fire, aiming the head of enemies, etc... you might want to skip this game.Pros:- Awesome atmosphere- Nice cutscenes- Good option menuCons:- Very hard to see what's going on- Monsters just run towards you- Repetitive- You're stuck with two guns (you can modify them but that means you'll mostly play with the same two weapojns for the whole game)			"

												I got Hard Reset on sale. I purchased it because I liked the Blade Runner vibe in the screenshots and trailers. Having just finished it, I can honestly say I would not have been disappointed even if I had purchased it at full price. Hard Reset is a run and gun that does not reinvent the wheel, but what it does, it does very well. The graphics and level design were great. The difficulty level, while at times frustrating, was neither too easy nor too difficult.  When it seemed like I had died 10 times in the same fight, I would step away from the game, but its fun, and I always came back for more. The weapons system is very simple - two highly upgradable guns. The upgrades were great - some of them more than others (smart gun and RPG were my favorites.) You can also upgrade the health system in a variety of ways. Its not overly complex, but it mixes things up a bit.Some people have complained about the repetitive look of things and the recycling of enemies. I actually really loved the art design of the game (the more human than human signs were a nice touch), especially in the Exile portion of the game, which has a completely different color palette than the main section. I didn't think the number of varying enemies was any less interesting than in say, Doom or Half-Life. I learned, as the game went on, how to handle different kinds of enemies with the weapons at my disposal.Another complaint I have seen is that Hard Reset is ""story lite."" This is true, but not to the extent I feared. The story/ concept is delivered in a format that mimics a comic book (which I thought was kind of cool), and while it isn't overly deep and doesn't have much in the way of character development, it compliments the game sufficiently to keep my interest. More than anything it serves to break up the ""chapters/ levels"" of the game and give context to the environment. This is NOT Deus Ex: Human Revolution, but its not just an arcade shoot-em-up either. I clocked about 29 hours before I was done with the main game and Exile DLC, but I went back a few times to try to find the ""secrets"" and to raise my level scores. These small elements give the game some limited replayability, and the overall length of the game is fantastic for the price. I have seen some say that it seems to drag on, but honestly, for my money, I would rather have a longer game than a shorter one, especially these days. Best of all, I had zero issues with this game - no crashes, no freezes, nothing. It just played right away and worked straight through to the end. When I would get swamped with enemies at times, my frame rate would drop, but given the sheer amount of activity on the screen this never suprised me or inhibited my play. Its relatively rare these days to find a game that isn't half broken on release, but Hard Reset is on that short list for me. So, all in all, kudos to the developers for making a GREAT run and gun game. I was thoroughly entertained and definitely recommend Hard Reset.			"

												For a game that was made in about 3 months, hard reset is actually pretty good (especially if you can pick it up for dirt cheap during a sale 5$).  The game basically feels like an old school shooter so no running into cover waiting for your shield/health to regen like a little girl.  It feels very old school which is going to either be a good or bad thing depending on your preference in shooters.  How the weapons work is actually pretty well thought out.  You essentially get 2 weapons, BUT those 2 weapons each have 5 different firing modes (so 10 weapons basically...) so switching to one weapon adds the modes to 1,2,3,4,5 on the keyboard and vice versa.  You can upgrade your weapons however you want, so you can make your favorite guns even more powerful and give them new firing modes.  The game also looks extremely pretty since it was developed ONLY for the pc.  No need to worry about the usual console port issues.  The story is pretty bad however, but it is good cheap fun.			"

												This game is Homage to shooters of the past.   With elements from Duke Nukem, Quake, Shadow Warrior, and Doom.  It has nice level design, although I will say its a more modern design of levels, as compared to the older games, but not as linear as Duke Nukem Forever.The guns are fun to use, and the upgrade system is a treat to work with.The graphics are pretty good, and the performance is pretty stable (with graphics maxed out) as long as you have a decent quad core cpu. Lighting is excellent.The story is kinda meh, but the setting and atmosphere of the game is awesome! Cyber punk dark sci-fi setting. I picked it up for $5 during Steams Winter Solstice sale.  I can recommend it easily at $10 for anyone who loves those oldschool style shooters. No multiplayer (rumors are game is being added on to with multiplayer as well some time next year) The music fits the setting, but doesn't really stand out on its own, but not really a fault as long as it goes with the settin			"

												Old school shooter, you get a couple of weapons and each have different firing modes and also get to upgrade each mode and there's no reloading. Campaign is about 4 hour hours long in medium difficulty but devs later on added free DLC which extendes the campaign further, the game does require good GPU power and looks pretty awesome, one thing I didn't like was the checkpoint system, its kind of annoying if you die often. It's usually on sale for around 3 or 4 bucks, you get good value out of it at that price.			"

												This is one of those titles that should be in every sci-fi and cyberpunk fans library, as well as anyone else who is interested in first-person-shooters. This is a very promising game that delivers in the action department. Story mode is not the most interesting but it is solid and keeps the hard-cop theme throughout. The atmosphere is the strong point in the game and where it impacts the most. It's those neon riddled buildings that drawn you into the experience. This is a diamond of a game and deserves more love and affection, hopefully even a sequel in the future.			"

												    Really fun action game, old style boss killing where you have to shoot some glowing parts while under fire from everywhere. Nice graphics, story is okay, sometimes dialogs aren't very good but after all it's a shooter action game!     Biggest downside; I often had the impression that I could go somewhere I coudn't and vice-versa. It can be slightly frustrating when you are trying to get secrets that you can see. Half of the time you have to progress further, other half you have to reach them right away. It gets confusing since it's hard to recognize a pattern. Likewise, the jumping system along with the 3D world is not intuitive. You can fell douzen of times thinking there's another way to get a secret and when you progress further you realize you've already missed it.Overall, I still finshed the game and had a lot of fun, so it's well worth buying and playing!

												I would like to start by saying this, ""yes a grenade luncher with a secondary funcation as a gravity trap is just the gun I wanted for Christmas but never got, thank you Flying Wild Hog for designing it"".  This game is just what you need if you want a Sci-fi, run'n'gun shooter with modern graphics and a story that could only be harder to understand if it was told to you in a for foreign language under water while sedated.  Theres a different weapon selection system, its not entirely bad, it does add in a layer of realism; instead of holding 5 conventional guns and 5 plasma guns you ony have one conventional gun and one plasma gun both with 5 weapon attachments that make this 2 guns act as 10. An unfortunate note is that there aren't that many enemy types compared to the previous works of the developers. But you know what it still worth your moneyz becuase at the end of the day if you can ranggle up your enemies like you're herder gun wielding sheep, then trap them in one location with the power of manipulating the very fabric of spacetime and then fire all you have its still more satisfying then another modern shooter with regenerative health an a covering machanic.... I have nothing against modern shooters just like I have nothing against water, I still don't want to drown in it though.			"

												Hard Reset feels like an old school FPS laced with modern graphics and special effects. The game itself is very well made and one can easily see the meticulous effort that went into designing the environments, enemies, and the weapons. Hard Reset offers a superb visual experience, but falls short in presenting an interesting narrative - a prominent issue in most contemporary video games. Is it worth the full retail price? Probably not, considering the very short campaign and lack of multiplayer. If you want to play this game, I would recommened you buy it on sale or play it on someone else's computer.			"

												Hard Reset is a sumptuous visual feast with massive boss fights.  It is amazing how the imagery surpasses a lot of the big-name titles that I see coming out.  The game has an upgrade system that functions like currency.  There are only two weapons, but each has about six intensive  diverse upgrades.  From rocket launchers, grenade launchers, to plasma cannon, EMP emitters, and a railgun, the weapons are hard hitting with a sound to match.  Most of the environment is explosive, electrocuting, and destructible which helps in dispatching an array of robots.  Cutscenes have a gritty, if not entirely cohesive storyline which was the only detraction.  The level designs are put together well and there is variety so that it doesn’t get repetitive.  The developers took a lot of time.  The gameplay will keep you engaged as it takes what’s right with old-school shooters, and adds faster elements .			"

												Now this is a very nice science fiction pulp game. It reminded me of some good old science fiction movies of the 80's and 90's like Screamers (somekind of terminator droid sf), Blade Runner etc. The details in the game are quite well worked out and the game looks very beautifull. The add signs on buildings. Flying ships and fancy modern and futuristic looking buildings and roads. The story telling is done cartoon style in the cutscenes. That actually takes a little away from the beauty that the gameplay levels have. It is about a world been partly taken over by renegade terminator style droid. The droids use razor blades to kill their targets. You are a mercenary been orded to take them out. You are actually in for the money. The sounds are good. Graphics and level building are extraordinary done. Although the gaming levels are quite linear. It is no free roaming the world in this game. The single player is worth it. It is a well made low budget game. Like the old movies these memories usually stay the longest. While afterwards you start to realise and appreciate the quality and effort that has been put in this game. There are no multiplayer features in this game. The AI enemies sometimes use little predictable tactics. These are the only two cons I can recall. So if you like to play a single player written story I would most definitely recommend this game.

												Hard Reset, oh boy. Though this game is a bit short, it is a fun (though nonsensical) sci-fi FPS. It is BRUTALLY diifficult: enemies prefer to use ambush tactics, come in big waves, and are quite capable of overwhelming the player. The player themselves has access to 2 weapons with 5 separate modes each, along with a secondary function for each mode. The CLN firearm is an advaned ballistic firearm, spewing bullets, mines, rockets, and grenades. The NRG weapon blasts rapidfire plasma orbs, plasma orbs that zap anything around them, shortrange lightning, tracking spheres, and it has a railgun mode. Ammo can be a bit tight in this game on occasion, however ammo for both guns regen if low enough, though this is rarely practical in combat.In short, it is a brutal game, but a lot of fun, especially after a few weapon upgrades.

												An excellent modern-made throwback to the more arcade-style shooters of the 90s. It looks great (it runs quite well too), it plays better. The developers pulled off the cyberpunk theme very well and fighting the ""mutant robots"" as I would call has never been this much fun. The design decision on two physical weapons that morph into multiple different functional weapons is an interesting and pleasing approach to the ""this dude can carry 20 different weapons"" factor. This game, at higher difficulty levels, is also very challenging. Experienced and older fans of the genre will find themselves at home amidst the dystopian city. Definitely recommended, download the demo to see what its all about.			"

												Hard Reset is SO good.While it is more linear than not, it keeps to the old school open levels, health and shield pickups, fast paced precision shooting and the arsenal in a pocket of first person shooters of old. Add to that some spectacular visuals and you get a triple A looking shooter that provides a serious challenge and hours of running and gunning joy. I found that playing on normal was very fair and well paced up until the Exile DLC (at which point I got my butt served to me on a silver platter) so I’m sure the replayability into the hard, insane and heroic modes is there.If you’re not a fan of the modern military shooter, join the club. But also think about giving Hard Reset a chance. It’s as if they stripped everything that makes Battlefield and COD dull and replaced it with over the top awesomeness.			"

												I got to say I liked Hard Reset quite a bit. I didn't quite care about the story, but the shooting was satisfying. The game has some nice visuals and futuristic industrial atmosphere. I liked getting back to the game.I've seen some complaints about the use of weapons in this game. At first it was strange how they have arranged the bullet-type weapons and energy-type weapons separately under Q and E buttons. Each type has many weapon variations under the number buttons. Once you get the hang of it, it works out smoothly and in my opinion the system is actually quite neat. I played the game and the Exile DLC through on normal difficulty. The game offered a some more challenging areas and some that I could have tried on hard difficulty. The harder parts did not feel unfair though and I was challenged to try again after getting killed. I also like the upgrade system in which by gathering nano-crates gives you options to upgrade weapons armor etc. Also the statistics after each level were interesting and give a reason to play the missions again.Overall I would recommend the game for fans of sci-fi shooters.

												Hard Reset gets a 8.5/10 from me, it's a good game. The only reason why there are some negative reviews is that this game is oldschool, meaning that you actually need skill and reflexes with a bit of tactic to survive. So if you're a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ casual go back to your cave, if you want a good oldschool shooter that rewards skill rather than grind, hard reset is the game for you.Let's start with the story: You are a cop/merc that has to kill all robots, thats basically it.Graphics:  The levels are colorful and the graphics of this game are awesome, lots of ligth effects, screenshake, uber physics, you can basically destzory everthing that is not attached to another object.Enemies: A bit monotone but require reflexes and the right tactic. Gunplay feels good, with some weapons being less rewarding than others, overall motivation is also good, exploring levels is quite well rewarded and you always look for more upgrades.I picked this game up for 3 bucks and had awesome fun with it, wish there were more games with this palystyle and graphics today, you won't find a better shooter for this price at the moment, devs even gave out a DLC for it.

												TLDR; Excellent run-and-gun game, but I felt let down a bit by the ending, it felt decidedly 'unepic'.Well, OK it was a ""Walk cautiously-and-gun"" game. I've played this game twice, now. If you play it on  Easy, you'll see an arena type area, and go ""here we go again and run in"" If you play it on normal, you will see an arena area and go ""oh no I'm going to get smashed again and try and sneak past (not gonna happen)""Some of the 'unique' things about this game, You can't crouch (whatdya MEAN I can't get through there)there is limited ammo (slowly recharges over time, but plenty of pickups from fallen bots)BUT there is no reload. all your ammo is in one big clip! it's so great!The Smart Gun on the NRG is OP Forget your rifle, max this as fast as you can, then go for you rifle's rocket launcheryou only get 2 guns, but they get a snotload of alt fire modesRPG elements through choosing what to upgrade... either gun, and choose from a variety of mods, or buff yourself with extra health / armour/ scanner/radar/medkit etc (I suggest getting the money-raqdar ASAP... before you get any gun upgrades)Gameplay tends to be tight corridors that lead into arena style rooms.Annoying thingsYou can't crouchinvisible walls. If they don't want you to go through there yet, you can't parkour it.arena battles, doors auto lock until you finish the fight, even though they work perfectly before and after the fight.the jumping/platforming bits (mostly for secrets) felt wrong. your character's movement through these sections is hard, as you move so fast by default, and no quicksave (it auto saves before every arena, and right before any parkour-to-your-death bits)The story was a huge let down thus far, even though it's open for a sequel, it felt like they finished in the middle of the story. Killing the boss didn't feel like taking down the baddies, merely  getting him out of the way so you could get through the next gate. (compounded the storyline)things i likedSecrets are REALLY worth taking the time to find. that extra cash allows you to build up your weapons much, much faster.without them, you might only have half the stuff unlocked by the end boss fight.on Normal, I was panicking about every corner, setting off the next wave of enemies.Oh, that Smart gun.you have real speed in this game, making a truely run-gun experience. Similar to Shadow Warrior (If you've played that, It's by the same guys, but you'd know that by all the references to HR in SW)the -nomagazine mechanic in the gunsgraphically beautifulThe physics engine feels spot-on most of the time (the way stuff gets thrown / lands / etc)With hints on, you can focus largely on gameplay, especially as some of the 'puzzles' can be otherwise obscure.So, A good looking FPS shooter with no quicksave (not a bad thing), RPG elements,  engaging and tactical combat (different enemy types are wiped out best by different weapon mods), and a few quirks. It took me 15h to clock it on easy (100% secrets), I have only got partway through on Normal so far. "

												Hard Reset is definitely an old school style shooter.  The game gets fairly difficult at times so dying repeatedly in certain areas is to be expected.  The story isn't amazing but the cutscenes are done in animated comic book style which is pretty cool.  The original campaign isn't too long, but combined with the Exile DLC, this game becomes a bit lengthier.  Because the DLC adds on more levels without including more weapons/upgrades, the game becomes harder, especially if the upgrades chosen before entering the DLC levels were purely offensive like I did.  The enemies become much tankier so getting upgrades on health, defense, and ammo are definitely needed.  On the other hand, the level design were more varied, which is a plus, and felt better overall.Technically, there are only two weapons, but each gun has multiple modes.  For example, one gun can transform from an assault rifle to a grenade launcher while the other can morph from traps to a rail gun.  Choosing the proper weapon and mode on the fly takes a while to get used to, but becomes fairly satisfying once you get the hang of it.  If your mouse has extra buttons, it's probably a good idea to hotkey the weapon swap to one of them as pressing the keys for it always felt a bit awkward for me.It's got a decent length campaign mode as well as other replayable modes, which I haven't tried.  While the story isn't quite there, I would recommend this if you want to play an old school shooter game.			"

												A fantastic but short first person shooter if you wish to kill some time. This game adapts some elements from old school first person shooters such as Quake. There's no reloading, no objective markers telling you where to go, no in game scripted cutscenes, and best of all, no regenerating health. I got in game on sale for $1.49 from bundle stars. It was definitely worth it without a doubt. But if you're expecting an fantastic Oscar award winning story from this game, you're not going to get any. Personally, when it comes to fps games, I for one do not care about storytelling aside from Halo and perhaps Bioshock, because when it comes to fps, I want experience whatever action the games deliver, which this game definitely does. There's action in every step of the way. But in case, you're curious, the game storyline honestly makes no sense, but like I said, who cares. You play as Major James Fletcher, some kind of cop, soldier, detective guy who has to fight his way through this futuristic looking city of Japan known as Bezoar through hordes of corrupt machines. To be honest, you're going to fighting the same exact machines over and over to the point where you might be bored of them. But don't worry, after the confusing ending from the 2nd boss fight, you will get to play the Exile Dlc, which will the continue the story. Gameplay wise, like I said, you have to pick up health and ammo, which is what I prefer a lot in first person shooters. There are 2 weapons to carry but you can keep upgrading them to do amazing things such as turning your assault rifle into a shotgun and shoot pellets that stun enemies.Above all, Hard Reset is a nice looking, fast paced first person shooter which you barely see nowadays. It's very short and you can beat in just a day so get it when it's on sale. If you enjoy classic styles in fps games, then pick up this game.			"

												Hard Reset is SO good.While it is more linear than not, it keeps to the old school open levels, health and shield pickups, fast paced precision shooting and the arsenal in a pocket of first person shooters of old. Add to that some spectacular visuals and you get a triple A looking shooter that provides a serious challenge and hours of running and gunning joy. I found that playing on normal was very fair and well paced up until the Exile DLC (at which point I got my butt served to me on a silver platter) so I’m sure the replayability into the hard, insane and heroic modes is there.If you’re not a fan of the modern military shooter, join the club. But also think about giving Hard Reset a chance. It’s as if they stripped everything that makes Battlefield and COD dull and replaced it with over the top awesomeness.			"

												Has a lot of flaws but is a good cyber-punk action. The Bezior city visuals are great but it feels so empty - there's no other human being except you - only robots (I suppose this makes the game cheaper for development but it makes impression).No flexibility in the gameplay at all - only shooting stupid (I mean with no AI) robots. But environment kills are fun and they are the only thing that the game allows you to experiment with.There are clever secret areas from time to time ,but also cannot compensate the repetitive gameplay too much.Anyways - thumbs up.

												Good game is good! Futuristic shoot 'em up based in a Bladerunner esque city. I had no idea what the story was but I enjoyed the pretty graphics and shiny robots! This game is fun, I enjoyed the choice of how to upgrade your weapons. I enjoyed how challenging it was even if sometimes it was frustratingly so. The battles and boss fights are huge, unless you are the king/queen of FPS then expect many deaths! Any negatives? Well, I suppose the movement was a little sticky at times. The player seemed to like getting trapped in every nook and cranny going meaning death would follow shortly after. It's a minor complaint. It didn't put me off and it shouldn't with you! :D			"

												In Hard Reset, you play a man with a metal eyes and no knees, in his quest to shoot every last robot ever.I would summarise the plot more, but I genuinely can't. I just don't understand it. However, the characters in the game seem to know what's going on, and I'm more than happy to let them handle the major decisions. I'll just shoot the robots, thanks very much.The plot is revealed to the player via cutscenes which have a pretty great animated comic-book style to them, bringing back fond memories of games like Max Payne. Gameplay is fun. The environments are impressive and reward player exploration. They have no shortage of things to blow up, and no shortage of things to blow them up with, because instead of picking up guns along the way, you start the game with both of the guns you will ever need, one gun that fires bullets, and one that fires plasma. When you pick up ""nano"" (the currency), a bar on your HUD will fill. When you reach 100%, it gives you one unlockable slot at an upgrade point, which gives your guns extra functionality. Buy a shotgun slot, and your gun gains the option to fire like a shotgun, etc. Thus you can scroll through each weapon's abilities like you would in any other FPS.It's a very neat concept, and one that comes in handy during intense firefights - of which there are plenty - switching between the plasma guns and the bullet guns to gain any advantage against the robot swarms.The music is pretty awesome too, and really sets the tone of this cyberpunk futuristic sprawling mega-tropolis. Not being too familiar with this sort of music, some of the tracks that play during combat remind me a bit of Pendulum, which I like.Visually, the game is a treat. The city looks grungy and run down, with worn paint and chipped metal contrasting nicely with garish neon and arcing electric bolts here and there. There's no problem at all telling what's environment and what's enemy, like in some games I've played, so you won't get your health chipped away by something you just can't see.This all sounds pretty great, right? So what's bad about the game?Well in my first sentence, I said that you play a man with no knees. Well that's pretty accurate, as you CANNOT CROUCH in this game. This is pretty irritating when you feel like taking cover might be helpful, or when there's a chest-high gap in a fence that you can't POSSIBLY get past.The most glaring example of this is probably in one of the warehouse levels, when a girder has fallen to approximately face height, blocking off a short path to the level exit. You don't even need to crouch to get past that. Just bend over by like five degrees. But no, you're forced down the other route that has explosions, fire, and angry robots just itching to taste your flesh.Another thing that annoys me is that your guy can - and will - get ganked, usually by enemies called Gorillas, that charge-slam you ever few seconds. It becomes very easy to go from full health to dead, trapped in a corner, being beaten by Gorillas, which is where another one of my niggles joins in:No quicksave/load. This kind of speaks for itself. Fast, frantic shooters like this NEED quicksave. In games like Alien Isolation, where not being able to save is legitmately part of the game, because the survival thing is supposed to be tense. In games like this, where you play a stompy god of hellfire, slowing down the fast-paced fun is irksome.Weapons. I really like the weapon system in this game, but it becomes very obvious quite early on that there is a right choice. That choice is the electric mortar. Area of effect attack instantly blows up the generic foot soldier robots, and saps the others. Switch that out with the grenade launcher, and you can very quickly turn the screen into an orgy of exploded robot parts. I've discovered no other combos of guns (as of yet) that can measure up in terms of fast, widespread, heavy damage.To conclude: Hard Reset is a bloody fun game, that will keep you entertained for as long as you care to play it. It's most assuredly worth the asking price.			"

												This game, a throwback first-person shooter by developer Flying Hog, has kicked my cojones up and down the cyperpunk metropolis setting with every tier of enemy at every level of gameplay. And I loved every minute of it. Honestly, it’s so refreshing to encounter a game that not only refuses to pull punches, but one that doesn’t have a problem with throwing a couple sucker punches to boot. Even the most basic enemies will swarm you with rotor and sawblades galore, and it’s immediately apparent upon entering the game that, protagonist or no, you are still only one big sack of organs ripe for robot destruction. The action is brutal, fast, and constant. "

												Yes, a hundred times yes. I had dismissed this game many times when it was first released, and I really regret that. I picked it up just after playing the new Shadow Warrior (from the same dev).This is an absolute classic, old school FPS. The game is set in a stunningly designed cyberpunk future, that will have you staring at all the intricate details in the buildings... right until the waves of cyborg enemies start. Great weapon design, especially the subtle animations as you upgrade your firepower with new modules and switch between them, and all have a great kick to them.Particle effects, explosions, fire - every firefight is a visual delight, especially with elements of the environment aiding in the destruction.If you are a fan of classic old school FPS, do not ignore this game. It's certainly worth its full asking price.			"

												Hard Reset is a game made with old school FPS sensibilities. It comes from the Serious Sam/Painkiller mold, where you have to run around like a maniac to kill baddies that are bigger and faster than you. Plus it's a cyber-punk game, but Deus Ex this ain't.The game has a lot going for it, even with some of its budget title sensibilities. The shooting is intense and satisfying, and the game features a variety of difficulty levels to match your skill level. You're equipped with two guns that can change forms to become 10 different weapons total. Learning the special features of all the weapons is key to surviving the fights that Hard Reset throws at you. Guns can be upgraded and unlocked at numerous kiosks strewn throughout the game, with credits picked up from enemy bots and secret areas. Here's where one of the game's flaws show up; there is no New Game Plus mode where you get to run back through earlier levels of the game with your upgraded guns, which would have been a lot of fun.The game is pretty to look at but short, even with the added DLC they give you for free, and the story never makes any sense. Even then, the price is right for a good, fast and fun shooter experience. These are the same guys responsible for the 2013 revamp of Shadow Warrior, and while the experience here isn't as polished as what you'll find there, it's still got a lot of bang for your buck. Worth it if you catch it on super sale!			"

												Hard Reset provides a sugary love letter to fans of the no holds barred, 12 gun carrying, wall to wall shooting and explosions shooters of the past; however in doing so it still maintains a modern identity of its own. In a market teeming with ironsight, cover system and squad command based first person shooter games (which are all of very high quality), it's intreresting to see a game chisel away the layers of peripheral gameplay features that have been slowly added one by one to make modern shooters what they are today and deliver a no nonsense fight-to-survive action rollercoaster. There's no aiming down sights, no taking cover or even crouching for that matter, no huge expansive environments, no mediocre plot that's trying to hard. There is a story and some really nice graphic novel-esque FMVs, but it's clear that this is a game all about playing. Imagine anything from the family of original first person shooters like Wolfenstein or Quake, just with high end graphics and a weapon modulation and upgrade system. But the core of the game is just you, your gun and a boatload of mechanical gribblies that want to saw you to pieces. This is a very neat game.			"

												As a sucker for fast paced shooters a la Painkiller... Hard Reset does the job! Not only does it have an enjoyable visual style with loads of neon lighting, it has a flawless gameplay mechanic that never gets old. Not the longest game (6-8 hours depending on the difficulty, which can get pretty challenging) but it offers plenty of extreme shooter fun. Not as mindless as a Painkiller or Serious Sam and definitely in a different ball park style-wise. If you're anything BUT a fan of those games, it's wise to skip this one as well.			"

												The intensity of this game reminds me of old-school shooters.  Fast-paced play and a limited number of enemy types.  But with hordes of enemies, you'd better be accurate and thoughtful because some sometimes you'll need to aim for the head, other times you'd better aim for the explosive next to them.  Sure, you only get two weapons but the upgrade options are interesting and you'll never see such an explosive environment in any other game.			"

												The people at ""Flying Wild Hog"" studios set out to make a cyber-punk shooter with fun gun-play mechanics....and they did it! 1)The overall experience: it's fast, action packed and simply fun. A person, who's childhood was based in the 90s, will notice that this game is heavily inspired by the old-school classics like Doom, Quake, Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior - your health is displayed on your lower left corner along with your ammo and shield capacity. If you are not careful those attributes will get depleted and you'll simply die with no ammo or health.  2)Digging a little deeper into the game - the game's story takes a backseat to it's gameplay. You are equipped with two guns which transform into several types and they can be upgraded throughout the game. This is the only modern mechanic implamented into the game. The game is powered by RoadHog Engine - there are impressive lighting effects, physics and decent textures, but the areas that you will visit are not verried. You'll visit the same industrial cyber-punk vistas, but from different angles. 3) Final Verdict - Hard Reset dosen't set out to re-imagine the genre. It is a familiar shooter, that brings back good memories of the fun I used to have while playing the shooters of the 90s! A great nostalgia trip and challenge for the modern gamer! I give Hard Reset a 8/10! :)			"

												An intense and straight forward experience for friends of old-school action. Very good mechanics both in feedback and direct controls. Strong and intense audio direction as well as solid visual art with pretty light(n)ing effects. Not so much ""Cyberpunk"" though, the presentation delivers more ordinary dark future SciFi, since the game doesn't reflect much of what would make it ""Cyberpunk"" due to its staging. However, this title delivers what the name promises. I'd recommend it now that they've fixed pretty much every minor problem that was in the demo and in the release version.			"

It could use some more variety in enemies, but the art design, level design, and weapons are all perfectly old-school.

												Hard Reset is one of these things called ""Old School Shooters"". In other words, the story is not worth mentioning, the enemy AI doesn't deserve the name, and the levels are as linear it gets thanks to our old friend ""Mr Invisible Wall"".And you know what? It doesn't matter. Because you get to blow up stuff. As in, LOTS of stuff. With numerous different weapons (or rather, one shooty gun and one flashy gun that however can transform into anything ranging from shotguns to rocket launchers to rail guns to tesla guns).So, you run around an kill robots. Again, LOTS of robots (though they sadly come in seven to nine different varieties only). And of course the big sky-scraper sized boss robots, too. The entire thing actually looks pretty damn good while all those bots get torn apart by bombs, bullets and lightning. The Soundtrack helps too, blending in nicely with the dystopian cyberpunk setting of the game in calm moments and turning to pumping electronica once the next wave of buzzsaw-mouth hoppers and fat, tough chargers comes in.TL/DR: If you like to shoot stuff, this game is for you.

Pretty fun little first person shooterOldschool, very linear, corridor and arena battles.  No crouching, lots of invisble fences to stop you from wandering or hopping up to higher ground.   Doors almost always lock behind you.  Lots of enemies, lots of dieing, very exciting action.  Battles can be very difficult but seems to always be an appropriate tactic for each.  Choose the right weapon combo and use environment right and you sail through, choose wrong and you die quickly.  Modern graphics, high detail levels and the enemy models are very good.  Story is alright, voice acting variable, player character's voice acting and dialog a little poor.  Poor use of expletives.Pros:  Really good action. Exciting, fast battles, lots of enemies. Decent variety of enemies.  Good weapon upgrade system with lots of interesting combos to use.  The over charge upgrade on the plasma gun for example is powerful and effective without taking the tiresome old route of exploding if held too long or immediately discharging. Well balanced fun weapon.  All weapons have their place and there is still use for the earlier weapons right up until the end of the game.  Nice looking game, a little dark (very Blade Runner) but overall good visual style. Its cheap too.ConsInvisible fences are annoying, no way to know if you can jump up on or pass something other than trying.  No quick save feature or any user controlled save.  Player character dialogue is littered with pointless poorly used F-bombs and poorly voice acted. Linear, door-locking-behind-you-before-ambush gameplay gets a little tiring.SumaryTruly oldschool style FPS with nice modern graphics and fast exciting action.  If you like oldschool shooters and cut your teeth on Doom you will love it.  If linear, confined gameplay isnt your thing it may not be a good choice.   I really enjoyed it for what it is.			"

												Good single player FPS with extremely satisfying explosions and a nice vibrant colour pallette.  A bit on the linear side with numerous small secrets and side rooms.  Enemy variation and AI is interesting, keeps you engaged and presents a credible threat.  Gun selection enjoyable and varied.  Some guns could be considered overpowered (homing bullets that go through walls for example) but due to the AI behaviour and level design they never make the chalenge trivial or unsatisfying.  Situations and enemies reach Serious Sam levels of ludicrousness at times.  Overall its well worth your money and I look forward tro trying the same studios efforts in Shadow Warrior.			"

The game itself is very well made and one can easily see the meticulous effort that went into designing the environments, enemies, and the weapons. Hard Reset offers a superb visual experience, but falls short in presenting an interesting narrative - a prominent issue in most contemporary video games. Is it worth the full retail price? Probably not, considering the very short campaign and lack of multiplayer. If you want to play this game, I would recommened you buy it on sale or play it on someone else's computer.			"

What is refreshing is that each weapon is unlocked through the use of an upgrade terminal and each weapon is within the two starting weapons you use. They're kind of like multipurpose weapons. They even have transformation animations! It is not as scary as doom or quake, the robots don't give off a ""horror"" vibe. They look like those robots people strap weapons on in an arena. For what it is, the graphics are great, the gameplay intense and bullet blazing! Just remember to apply combos between your weapon sets for maximum carnage!			"

												A couple of hours playing this and I am having a great time. A really nice cyberpunk setting and despite the fact that I am using a 3 year old graphics card at the moment and there is a hell of a lot going on visually it is running beautifully.I very much get the impresion this is a game that knows what it is and is not trying to be something it isn't. It is basically a twitch shooter with loads of bad guys. ok robots, and loads of shooting. Yes it is a corridoor shooter but that is not always a bad thing and unlike a lot of games it is not pretending to be anything else.I love big open world sandpit games like Farcry and Skyrim and first person rpg shooters being a huge Deus Ex fan (I refuse to acknowledge the second one as a Deus Ex game it would be too painfull ). However I also like a good old style shooter where I can just dive in for an hour or two and blow the hell out of everything that moves and to me that is exactly what this is.  They are not east to do well, just look at the abomination that was Duke Nukem Forever,  and this one has been done well and is fun.If you want great story and character development forget it there isn't either. However if you want a good fun fps with a great graphical feel that knows exactly what it is and does it well buy and have fun. If you look at what this developer has gone on to do since with the new Shadow Warrior you can see they have a real understanding of the genre.Playing this takes me back to the likes of Duke Nukem 3D, the origional Shadow Warrior and Serious Sam with his BFG (We all know the F stood for Friendly, honest...) So lock and load, hold down the trigger and send those bots to that great scrapyard beyond the mechanical veil.			"

												This game is a modern day shooter with old style play. No iron sights, no regenerating health. You get two weapons, each one with 5 different modes which basically makes 10 weapons. Its set in the futrure and you basically have to blast your way through robots enemies. Great game if you like the older style of FPS. One big drawback is the lack of quick saves, its a checkpoint game.			"

												Hard Reset is a fun little old school shooter with a great Blade Runner vibe and outstanding atmosphere. The story is simple and forgettable, just enough to provide a little context in between bouts of fighting off hordes of robots with some very fun weapons. From a railgun straight out of Quake to amusing gravity grenades that suck robots up into a nice explodable pile, some of the best fun is in choosing the right weapon for the current situation.Frequent pauses in the form of looking for power ups keeps the action from getting too monotonous, leaving you with nice pacing and a little breather in between hard fights. And there are plenty of those on the higher difficulties. But don't expect to come away from these little pauses without a few surprises, the developers definitely like to keep you on your toes.The game is quite short, though the free DLC almost doubles the number of missions and a survival mode gives it some extra replayability.The way the in game menus are handled is a great touch, you're never taken out of the environment to click through a pop up window and there is no dedicated ""use"" button. Simply walk up to a terminal and your mouse cursor automatically appears to let you interact with it, very nice!One tip, don't bother upgrading the two starting weapons until later in the game. Some of the unlocks (especially the grenade launcher) are much more useful (and fun).			"

												This game rocks! The graphics and environments are some of the best I've seen in any game, ever. Weapons upgrades are super-customizable, and the fights can be tough. The original game is rather short, but with the included DLC I think it's well worth $15, and I got it on sale for $5- which is a steal. This game is action packed from the start and you'll be in another fight before you've caught your breath from the last one. Replay value is through the roof, as there is no way to get all the weapons upgrades before the game is over, and they offer a ""plus"" mode so you can keep all your upgrades for the next playthrough. This game really reminds me of Red Faction: Armageddon... so if you loved that, buy this!!!			"

												You: I'm a pro gamer and shooter veteran.Game: Show me!If you are looking for a real shooter, a real challenge and want to enjoy a shooter like it was intended to be and a game which really deserves the genre title shooter then Hard Reset is for you. If not then Hard Reset is also for you. It's a damn good looking game and you will enjoy it.Let's start with the pros: - This game is hard. Even on easy difficulty it's a real challenge. In other words we would say it's a shooter which deserves the name old-school shooter. The game is not forgiving. You have to practice a lot to master it on a normal or harder difficulty. While usually this wouldn't be an argument to buy a game this is exactly what makes Hard Reset a gem. It is challenging but never frustrating. That's the big difference to other titles.- Awesome graphics. While not a must-have these days (even for shooters) this game looks awesome on a PC. The engine is very well optimized and it runs also great and low-spec rigs. This is not a poor console port. It was developed for PC and there it performs awesome. - Great level design. While like any other shooter this game is very linear but it doesn't suffer any minute from this. The overall level design let you forget about that. Good placement of power ups and health. Great placement of secrets. If you are a shooter veteran and grew up with the good old titles you will love this one. - Great setting. The game takes place in a cyberpunk future. Everything fits perfectly in there. Graphics, atmosphere, sounds, even the small little things like the funny posters hanging around here and there. If you have the time between the battles take a closer look. You will love it.The ""not so"" good: - while there was only one point that could be criticized at first was the length of the game. The game was although its moderate/hard difficulty kinda short in playtime. This was fixed with the first DLC which was free. It took the game to the next step and made it a real competitor to the AAA titles out there. So this point isn't a con any more. If you take into consideration:1) the low price2) the quality of this product3) the nostalgia for old school shooter fans4) the replay value (yes I wanted to finish the is game on insane even though I suck in such difficulties)this game is a must have for every shooter fan. It's the champions league of the current shooter genre  and was the biggest surprise the last years. While everyone thought the shooter genre is dead Flying Wild Hog proved em wrong with this one.Get this title. The only category this game fits in would be ""most overlooked gem in recent shooter history""			"

												While this may not be the most exciting of FPS games. Hard Reset does manage to get a number of things right, good graphics,  interesting weapons, decent voice acting and a unique style of cutscene (although seen before) adds to the overall feel of the game. What it gets wrong is the on-rails level design and the the charcaters inabilty to crouch (its not 1990!!!). Other than that there is nothing really wrong with the game. For its price its a good bit of entertainment, I would love to see what the developers cook up next.			"

												Almost instantly Hard Reset brought to mind all those great late-90's FPS games. With a modern touch and great attention to detail, especially with the level design and enemy types, this game is truly both a blast from the past and a blast of fresh air. It is a shame that an amazing game like this has gone so unnoticed. I certainly am very glad that I decided to give it a go. Cool noir-ish style in its story, some very intriguing sci-fi concepts, fantastic gunplay and a gun-focused progression system, this game doesn't really lack anything. The gun system is interesting, you have two guns which have multiple modes of firing and you upgrade them as you go, also unlocking more fire modes, I think this system works very well combined with all the different enemies you'll face. I especially liked shooting the bigger enemies with a shotgun or a railgun, and seeing all the armor plating fly away, yet the buggers kept coming - so many thrilling fights! The boss fights are very enjoyable, the levels have lots of destructible environment and last but not least; this game has a lot of secret places - just like good old FPS games used to have. If you are a FPS fan, you should definitely play this one through.			"

This game also seems heavily inspired by the sci-fi noir of Bladerunner, and has a story that's both tongue-in-cheek cheesy, but at the same time seems like it could be from an original captivating graphic novel.

												This is an interesting game with a cool art style. The soundtrack is a cool Techno inspired sound, the graphics are a bit neon sporting bright red, blue, and green. In between fighting the story unfolds through comic book pages, similar to how Max Payne worked. It has a bit of a learning curve with some depth to the upgrade options between your weapons and character. Boss fights are a little tedious as they are the ""new, old school"" as I call it with a throw back to old console games where you shoot the glowing bit until it falls off. All in all not a bad game, worth $5 or $10 bucks.Tips: Play on Normal, this game is brutal on Hard...I played on Hard and got super frusterated a bunch of times.Upgrade your CLN and NRG weapons. Learn to switch between the CLN #1 (Rifle), CLN #2 (Shotgun), NRG #1 (forget the name) and NRG #3 (Mortar), and CLN #4 (RPG). I found that a combo of CLN #3 and NRG #3 was my best way to take down most things quickly.			"

												My first review.I bought this game in the Winter Steam sale - only cost a few pounds and the description made the game sound quite good.  I was not disappointed.I've only played about 6 hours of the game at the time of typing but it would be fair to say that the graphics are very good.  I love the fact that a lot of the environment is desctructible and causes a lot of explosions.  Hell, I can simply spen 5 minutes shooting explodable barrels and gas cannisters just to watch the explosion causing barrels to shoot into the air.  It would be fair to say therefore that the physics are top.The storyline is okay.  And that's coming from me who has the attention span of a 5 year old and struggles to follow any story line.  The game is linear but not too restricting.  There are secret areas to find points that allow you to level up your kit.  I'm mainly using the gatling gun type thing.  Add a grenade launcher and mine placer/firer thing and it's a decent weapon.It's quite difficult on normal difficulty and some of the end level bosses are difficult.  Overall, it's a fun game, with good graphics and music score (forgot to mention that).			"

												Hard Reset is a sumptuous visual feast with massive boss fights.  It is amazing how the imagery surpasses a lot of the big-name titles that I see coming out.  The game has an upgrade system that functions like currency.  There are only two weapons, but each has about six intensive  diverse upgrades.  From rocket launchers, grenade launchers, to plasma cannon, EMP emitters, and a railgun, the weapons are hard hitting with a sound to match.  Most of the environment is explosive, electrocuting, and destructible which helps in dispatching an array of robots.  Cutscenes have a gritty, if not entirely cohesive storyline which was the only detraction.  The level designs are put together well and there is variety so that it doesn’t get repetitive.  The developers took a lot of time.  The gameplay will keep you engaged as it takes what’s right with old-school shooters, and adds faster elements .			"

												Now this is a very nice science fiction pulp game. It reminded me of some good old science fiction movies of the 80's and 90's like Screamers (somekind of terminator droid sf), Blade Runner etc. The details in the game are quite well worked out and the game looks very beautifull. The add signs on buildings. Flying ships and fancy modern and futuristic looking buildings and roads. The story telling is done cartoon style in the cutscenes. That actually takes a little away from the beauty that the gameplay levels have. It is about a world been partly taken over by renegade terminator style droid. The droids use razor blades to kill their targets. You are a mercenary been orded to take them out. You are actually in for the money. The sounds are good. Graphics and level building are extraordinary done. Although the gaming levels are quite linear. It is no free roaming the world in this game. The single player is worth it. It is a well made low budget game. Like the old movies these memories usually stay the longest. While afterwards you start to realise and appreciate the quality and effort that has been put in this game. There are no multiplayer features in this game. The AI enemies sometimes use little predictable tactics. These are the only two cons I can recall. So if you like to play a single player written story I would most definitely recommend this game.

It is OK game but limitations start to annoy pretty soon, especially the fact that you cannot crouch forces you to find a way to jump to the other side.

												The game play really felt like a Quake or Doom shooter, I loved it. For me the best combat system of any FPS I haver played all year. There are multiple weapon combinations with different abilities. Putting up a stasis field, lobbing a gravity field grenade into it, watching it pull in multiple robots of all sizes, and launching a barrage of rockets into it watching everything explode was awesome. The story line was not very interesting, and the voice acting was average, but the gameplay for me made this game totally worth it. It is not easy even on normal, the check points are painfull sometimes, and it got me to rage quit more than a few times, but oh man it felt good taking down those tough fights. I cant even imagine how difficult it must be on insane. If you are looking for a good story dont play it, but if you liked the old school fast, tough fps like Quake and Doom definetely give this a shot you will love it.			"

												Hard Reset is an FPS for those who might want to see what one of those more old-fashioned FPS games would be like if they were made today. Your character can take a few shots, the enemies are varied and the bosses intimidating, the weapon selection is very varied, the gameplay relies on the important gameplay mechanics rather than scripted sequences, there's no cover-based gameplay to be seen and furthermore, so many devious secrets in the levels that you'll absolutely burn ourself out if you try looking for them all.The gameplay is meaty, fast-paced and overall well polished.

												Hard Reset is a solid shooter. Great graphics, fair longevity (at least for the price), nice sounds and musics... and a completely useless plot. Useles not because it's totally bad, but because it's told only through 'comic-like' cutscenes while loading the next level, and not through actual gameplay; that makes the story completely dull and forgettable.If you want a good first person shooter, Hard Reset is great for the price: it' hard enough, it's a pleasure for the eyes and it sounds nice.

												A Doom clone for the modern age. Right off the bat, I'm a sucker for these retro games with modern visuals. It plays exactly like the old shooters, but has pretty modern graphics. I absolutely loved this game and hope that this gets a sequel or something. BUT, it is a niche shooter and I think this game is not for everyone. If you grew up playing Doom, Wolfenstein 3D, Quake, or Duke Nukem (and liked them) or you play them now you will probably like this game. However, if you grew up playing more modern shooters like Halo, Call of Duty or Battlefield (or you prefer them) this is not the game for you. Honestly I consider this to be a Doom 4 primer.+Awesome aesthetics, the sci-fi blade runner art works well hereGuns for most play styles (Shotguns Assault rifles, Rocket launchers, etc.)You don't HAVE to use all the guns, find one you like and upgrade that oneNo reloads! One big magazineWeapons mostly use same ammo! NO scrounging for Rifle roundsRPG elements allow you to customize your character-Cheap deaths occasionally, you get hung up on a brick while enemies pummel youA little too linear for it's own goodThe story is pretty lame, but that's par for most shootersEnemies are ruthless and plenty, I died often on normal.8/10			"

												A hidden gem among indie PC exclusives. This is an underrated game that deserves your attention. Picked it up on sale for $3 thinking it would be some half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ low-optimization time waster. Man was I wrong about that. Hard Rest is easily worth the full $15 price tag. Sure, the voice acting could use some work, but I do love the comic book aesthetic of the cutscenes through which the story is told.Highly recommended for fans of futuristic first-person shooters and cyberpunk games. Hell, you should pick this up even if you aren't into the whole cyberpunk thing. At a regular price of $15, and a discount price of $3, there's really no reason not to buy it. You really don't know what you're missing here. If you aren't convinced yet (or just don't want to believe me), then I suggest you download the demo and see the quality for yourself.			"

												This game is awesome!  It takes the classic 90's FPS formula and updates it for the modern generation.  Kinda like what Serious Sam did, but takes it in a different direction.  Its constant action, but to survive requires second-to-second strategy, recognizing enemy ai patterns and the perfect weapon to use for each element of an encounter.  During a single battle, i'd switch between 3-4  weapons atleast, and sometimes more to perfect the strategy.  I like how the ammo system works, so you can concentrate on which weapon is the best to do the job instead of constantly rationing the best weapons incase there is an extreme scenario down the line that needs it.  Also, the checkpoint system was tweaked just right so I don't need to save/load spam to beat an area, and gives a good opportunity to think of a new strategy to enter a battle with each time I die, just like classic side scroller games did.

												Before getting into  this game, you need to understand a few basic points:1. This isn't a AAA game.2. This is a ""linear"" game, and no, it isn't a downside, neither a flaw in design, it's what it was intended to be and what its target wanted.3. No, you don't have -fake- ""choices"" to make or ""waifus"" to fulfill your needs of self-worth, it is an ""old school"" shooter with a half-decent story (with really bad dialog and voice acting) and it is heavily focused on gameplay and FUN.When you play it on the hardest difficulty setting, it is actually HARD and sometimes it can feel unfair, you will get stuck at some parts and feel it is impossible, The game is broken! But when you beat those parts it is very rewarding and you realize that you just had to get out of your comfort zone ( your gameplay style and strategy). The reason I used  quote marks on the ""old school"" term, it is because this game is old school, but in a 2k FPS style. You aren't a minion jumping around in a big level as you do on Quake and Doom, your mobility is mostly horizontal and although you can jump over some stuff in the map, your mobility is not close to the one you had in 90's FPS tittles, but like Doom 3 instead.The game has a ""currency"" called N.A.N.O. which helps you to get upgrades and some packs if such currency can be hidden in a variety of places, many of them are hidden  in the fashion some games hide their ""collectibles"" behind walls you have to destroy, others are just behind a box or a corner and they are very easy to miss of you don't explore a bit (but just a little bit).Although you ""technically"" use the same two guns through the entire game, the guns change their form with a very nice animation each time you change to another weapon. There are good, feel nice, and aside from the basics, one of them uses energy and the other is a more ""classical"" projectile based weapon, they have many variances and again: they feel really well to use.Lenght-wise, well, this game isn't an RPG, but after the complaints about its duration when the first edition was released, the game got this free expansion (Extended Edition) that added around 3h reaching  solid 6-7 hours, The game is very replayable and it has some ""arcade"" characteristics/features:Replayability of each levelSurvival modeFinal screendisplaying completion time, percentage of available nano collected, secrets found (X/Y), etc.Interesting bosses.About the graphics: as you can see by the screenshots, it's very well done and rounded, artists really focused on making the metal look ""real"" and although ultra-realistic graphics isn't the main focus it  features very good good visuals.Flaws?Yes, it isn't a ""perfect"" game, although I struggle trying to not find this flaws on almost every TPS/FPS out there:1[/b. Enemy spawn patters are predictable2[/b. As I already mentioned it; it's mobility, it tends to feel very constricted, specially nowadays that people is used to jump off a second floor unharmed with  regular humans, I know the game is meant to be this way (because of budget) but mobility could add a lot to it.3. Enemies are varied, but many designs are recycled in the sense that you see nearly similar robots, which are actually  different, but they seem to be made with the sense of them feeling ""realistic"" (and because of budget) so you don't have over-the-top and different designs but slightly modified models even though they will do very different things, but I guess a lot of games do this.4. Its story is VERY disconnected from gameplay, you see everything in a comic-style cutscene between loading times. In general, the story has a couple of surprises, but it is bland and it could be done way better.5. Checkpoints tend to be somewhat inconsistent, sometimes you will have to do 3 times what you regularly do to get a checkpoints, more consistency would be good.6. The soundtrack is very basic and it would be epic to have a really well-worked soundtrack, specially for the bossfights.7. Although some people  STILL complaining about duration, it's something you should consider if you feel ripped-off if a game doesn't last 234141049 hours.My rating:7.5/10 (Good+) "

												One of the funniest FPS I have ever player. I liked the cyberpunk setting. The gameplay is a bit frantic and it's like a ""tactical"" weapon shooter, in the sense that you have to carefully choose and swap your weapon before enemy encoutnering in order to eliminate enemies far from your position (es: using mortars). Otherwise they are a lot and quickly surrond you!.For Eur 5 it's the best I bought in years . My mark for this game: 5/5Have fun!			"

												An intense and straight forward experience for friends of old-school action. Very good mechanics both in feedback and direct controls. Strong and intense audio direction as well as solid visual art with pretty light(n)ing effects. Not so much ""Cyberpunk"" though, the presentation delivers more ordinary dark future SciFi, since the game doesn't reflect much of what would make it ""Cyberpunk"" due to its staging. However, this title delivers what the name promises. I'd recommend it now that they've fixed pretty much every minor problem that was in the demo and in the release version.			"

												Good single player FPS with extremely satisfying explosions and a nice vibrant colour pallette.  A bit on the linear side with numerous small secrets and side rooms.  Enemy variation and AI is interesting, keeps you engaged and presents a credible threat.  Gun selection enjoyable and varied.  Some guns could be considered overpowered (homing bullets that go through walls for example) but due to the AI behaviour and level design they never make the chalenge trivial or unsatisfying.  Situations and enemies reach Serious Sam levels of ludicrousness at times.  Overall its well worth your money and I look forward tro trying the same studios efforts in Shadow Warrior.			"

												Hard Reset is a fun little old school shooter with a great Blade Runner vibe and outstanding atmosphere. The story is simple and forgettable, just enough to provide a little context in between bouts of fighting off hordes of robots with some very fun weapons. From a railgun straight out of Quake to amusing gravity grenades that suck robots up into a nice explodable pile, some of the best fun is in choosing the right weapon for the current situation.Frequent pauses in the form of looking for power ups keeps the action from getting too monotonous, leaving you with nice pacing and a little breather in between hard fights. And there are plenty of those on the higher difficulties. But don't expect to come away from these little pauses without a few surprises, the developers definitely like to keep you on your toes.The game is quite short, though the free DLC almost doubles the number of missions and a survival mode gives it some extra replayability.The way the in game menus are handled is a great touch, you're never taken out of the environment to click through a pop up window and there is no dedicated ""use"" button. Simply walk up to a terminal and your mouse cursor automatically appears to let you interact with it, very nice!One tip, don't bother upgrading the two starting weapons until later in the game. Some of the unlocks (especially the grenade launcher) are much more useful (and fun).			"

												Old school massive shooter, same as Quake 2 or Serious Sam with awesome owerpowered graphics in cyberpunk themed city Bezoar, where you fight with robots who taked control in one sector, there will be tons of enemys, and you can kill them by environment or your 2 guns, you thing ""Only 2 guns wtf?"", yea, but every gun have  5 mods (you can buy them via skillpoints), so fun is obtained.In every map you can destroy tons of things, (you'll get achievement for that :D )Playtime is pretty good, over 7 hours with Exile DLC (It's free), with EX mod where you can play again but with you current skill points from end of last campain can by playtime x times longer.Also game have Survival mode when you'll get some points to global leaderboard.pros:-> Very nice graphics.-> Interactive Environment-> Lots of enemies-> Environment same as in Blade Runner.-> Exile free DLC with additional 4 hours gameplay.-> Static map FPScons:-> Story-> Not good for older processors			"

												One of the must UNDER-rated games on Steam.  Wild Hogs has quickly become one of my favorite studios.  Not only do they produce really fun, interesting games, but they're solid members of the gaming community, respond quickly to issues and are dedicated to PC gaming.Between this and Shadow Warrior, I believe Wild Hogs is a game developer to watch.  How many companies can say that they've never produced a clunker.I would love to see what they'd produce with a really big budget.  I heartily recommend Hard Reset if you like serious First-Person Shooter games.  It reminds me of an updated version of old school games like Unreal Tournament.  It will get your heart pounding.  Be sure to kick the difficulty up if the game seems to easy for you.  It makes a big difference.			"

												Even after only playing through it's horde mode and first few levels this is an impressive game. An old school shooter with a beautiful cyber-punk style art design and music score. The gameplay while simple at first glance hides a elegance of design in its user interface and weapon abilities. The plasma mortar upgrade is ALOT of fun.Levels contain secrets hidden in destructible areas or just under/inside objects in the world so you can hunt away for all the little nook and crannies.And its not exactly expensive especially right now so why not give it a shot? Old school style.I'm impressed.			"

												Great little game, better than I expected but there is no real re-play value (other than doing the campaign over again but this time keeping all you previous upgrades, you won't max them first time around) I recommend buying it on sale or not, either way it's worth it.  It's only about 5 hours long but it's a visually stimulating game that goes back to old school shooters. The story line makes sense for the most part and it can be as easy or challenging as you'd like.			"

												It's not the best FPS around. The story is just plain bad. The visuals are very good and modern, but not always. There are some areas where you find yourself in early 2000's enviroments. It's weird, you can see where they had to cut corners. The guns aren't interesting at all.. they are slow and underpowered.But for a mindless shooter it's alright, I bought it in a sale, so it's a short 5 or 6 hours of shooting the same robots over and over in waves until the big guy show up and you shoot him down.

												Dark-still-fancy sci-fi settings and frenetic gameplay, but watch out! This reset is VERY hard!No, really, this game will make you cry. Approach it with a HUGE amount of ZEN. Really. I played it 10hrs in one year and it looks to me like 900.000 hours. You will die 12 times every 10 meters on NORMAL. And it saves with checkpoints. And every achievement is triple: one for every difficulty level. So you can't even please yourself with achievement hunt.No, really. It's good and I liked it, but the thought of starting it creeps me out every time. You have to be mentally prepared to play this.			"

												While it's not a Duke3D or Doom 2 sort of ""old school"" Hard Reset definitely harkens back to Serious Sam, Painkiller, and even Quake 4. Beautiful environments, brutal enemies, and exotic upgradable weaponry system combine to deliver a very solid shooter. Health packs, skippable inbetween-level cutscenes and spawn triggers will bring you back to a different age of PC gaming. Personally, I purchased Hard Reset on sale and after finishing the game, feel guilty I didn't pre-order it. If you are looking for a challenge, play through this on Insane - while it feels impossible at times, the feeling of triumph you have after completing difficult sections of the game is uplifting. Secrets are abound in this game, some tougher to find than others, but each one gives you currency used to upgrade your weapons or unlock new ones.While it ends a bit abruptly, the ride there is full of gunplay. Some of the AI is simplistic, but the volume and strength of the enemies provide difficulty. Loved it.			"

Any part of a level you can see that is inaccessible, is somewhere you're going to end up later.  You'll end up seeing the same places from four different angles, again and again.

Challenging on some points at first you might have no idea what going on when you start playing but its so addictive that you just have to play it. There is one con I don't like when you switch game again and click resume or load game, you still have to go through same mission a bit thats mean kill the enemies once again, but overall isn't too bad.Definitely recomended for those who likes those types and those who would like try something new this game would suit you.

												Hard Reset is a throwback to oldschool FPS where reloading is nonexistent, enemies are numerous and the explosions are more important than the story. This mishmash of fast paced action with spliced in comic book story scenes between levels does a good job of creating an interesting environment but also one you're not going to get too attached to. That's good since the game is actually quite short, although made significantly longer if you own the DLC. The game has only two weapons, but as you progress you can purchase weapon attachments and upgrades, essentially giving you a total of 10 weapons to play with, in addition to a number of armor and utility upgrades. The action is fast, the guns are fun and satisfying to use, and the game is hard. Very hard. In fact even if you're a veteran it may behoove you to start on a lower difficulty until you get used to it because this game is completely unforgiving. There's no regenerating health or ammo, the enemies do a lot of damage, they're relentless, and you will die extremely fast if surrounded.For the low prices this game goes for nowadays there's not really a way I can't recommend this. If you enjoy oldschool FPS like Doom, Quake or Duke Nukem (or even semi-modern ones like Serious Sam) you'll probably enjoy Hard Reset. If not, it's hard to say. Either way you can probably find the game for a couple dollars either in a bundle or on sale and if you do I'd say it's well worth the money.With Hard Reset: Redux out you'll probably want to take a look at that instead.

Know this person like I do I immediately purchased this game.It only has 2 guns. 2 upgradeable guns with unique firing modes and shared ammo types. This forces you into being a bit conservative with ammo even though you'll never really be held back. Also, having an RPG that follows your laser is awesome.If only Fletcher's voice actor was better, if only the story made more sense, if only I got to play some of the scenes depicted in the animatics - this would be a blockbuster.

												I wanted to love this game, I really did.  It was made by a new company with people who respect PC gamers.  However, even if it is a pure game, undefiled by contard hands, I can't overlook its flaws.  Primarily, it's story, settings, and charectars are utterly slapdash.  I wrote more coherant stories with better dialogue when I was in grade school.  They really dropped the ball, the story is all but incomprehensible, and the game's objectives don't make a whole lot of sense either.The gunplay is nice, if nothing else, but once you have railgun and shotgun, you don't need too much else.  They fixed the weapon switching taking too long at least.  It does feel like there are too few enemy types.The graphics, of course, are drop dead goregeous, and everything runs smooth as butter.  It's a visually apealing game, if not a terribly complex one.All in all, I had fun with it, but I can't in good consience reccomend it until it drops to at least $15.			"

												This is an old-school FPS with a very nice graphics engine, like Serious Sam or Painkiller.The story is very paper-thin with lowsy dialogues and that's fine, really, because the game's focus is the combat.Speaking of combat, this game is very punishing. If you're a casual player, I recommend playing this on Easy.The game doesn't last long (around 6 hours, DLC included) and it's pretty cheap.If you just want to shoot at stuff, but also being challenged while at it, give it a try.

												You: I'm a pro gamer and shooter veteran.Game: Show me!If you are looking for a real shooter, a real challenge and want to enjoy a shooter like it was intended to be and a game which really deserves the genre title shooter then Hard Reset is for you. If not then Hard Reset is also for you. It's a damn good looking game and you will enjoy it.Let's start with the pros: - This game is hard. Even on easy difficulty it's a real challenge. In other words we would say it's a shooter which deserves the name old-school shooter. The game is not forgiving. You have to practice a lot to master it on a normal or harder difficulty. While usually this wouldn't be an argument to buy a game this is exactly what makes Hard Reset a gem. It is challenging but never frustrating. That's the big difference to other titles.- Awesome graphics. While not a must-have these days (even for shooters) this game looks awesome on a PC. The engine is very well optimized and it runs also great and low-spec rigs. This is not a poor console port. It was developed for PC and there it performs awesome. - Great level design. While like any other shooter this game is very linear but it doesn't suffer any minute from this. The overall level design let you forget about that. Good placement of power ups and health. Great placement of secrets. If you are a shooter veteran and grew up with the good old titles you will love this one. - Great setting. The game takes place in a cyberpunk future. Everything fits perfectly in there. Graphics, atmosphere, sounds, even the small little things like the funny posters hanging around here and there. If you have the time between the battles take a closer look. You will love it.The ""not so"" good: - while there was only one point that could be criticized at first was the length of the game. The game was although its moderate/hard difficulty kinda short in playtime. This was fixed with the first DLC which was free. It took the game to the next step and made it a real competitor to the AAA titles out there. So this point isn't a con any more. If you take into consideration:1) the low price2) the quality of this product3) the nostalgia for old school shooter fans4) the replay value (yes I wanted to finish the is game on insane even though I suck in such difficulties)this game is a must have for every shooter fan. It's the champions league of the current shooter genre  and was the biggest surprise the last years. While everyone thought the shooter genre is dead Flying Wild Hog proved em wrong with this one.Get this title. The only category this game fits in would be ""most overlooked gem in recent shooter history""			"

												It's really an ok game. the game play is kind of fun, if you're looking for something new and you don't have any other games on your list, it's fun. The story is pretty much nonexistent, as your character is a numbered soldier and has virtually no character development aside from an attempt to establish that he has a bad boy attitude in the first cut scene. Every level looks exactly the same since they all have the same generic dark rainy dystopia (Bladerunner) aesthetic. overall, i'd give it a 4/10.			"

												Got the Extended Edition on Steam sale for €2, after trying the demo. No issues with either in Windows10, so far. First, good that they make a demo, not enough game makers do this. Second, this is a thoroughly enjoyable game. Really nice graphics, good atmosphere (note the floating advertising ships, remind you of anything?), fun combat. As noted by many others, weapon management is key. This is not a complicated game by any standard, but running in guns blazing without thought will get you killed. Find a combo that works and get to work. About 80% through the game now, my favorite is the gravity grenade / railgun, because, railgun!The graphic novel bits have a nice feel to them, but the lines the main character produces would make Duke Nukem cringe. He appears to have the intellect of a buttermilk pancake without syrup.Bottomline, if you like FPS, get Hard Reset at this ridiculous price,			"

Levels divided into smaller arena like areas where you often have to face enemies in a large enough number to clog up most of your screen.

												This game is pretty cool!  It is a Future Man Vs Machine FPS game.  The graphics are awesome and the way things blow up with peices going every where is even better.  The controls are good, the lighting is good, and best of all ~ the gameplay is pretty fun.The only downfall is that it ended after 4 hours and I wish the game had more effective weapons.  Once I got the smart gun I pondered why would I use anything else unless i was surrounded by tons of little bots.  The set up will remind you a bit of Serious Sam or PainKiller ~ because everytime you pick up goodies or cross a border into a new room.... expect to get jumped by robots.Better than I expected and worth the price tag.  A word of warning ~ do not buy this game expecting some awesome story or if you prefer shooting people.  In this game you never actually see another moving person and you only fight robots in furturistic areas with futuristic guns.			"

Somewhat failed in my opinion, it took too many of the bad aspects instead of the good ones, and most of the modern aspects were the bad ones too (only implemented worse than usual). Despite all that it still manages to be a fun mindless shooter when you ignore the terrible voice acting and pretense of a plot. Worth picking up on sale/for cheap for sure.			"

												So this is more of a first impression kind of thing I will update this as I play more of the game.  So at first I had trouble getting into the game, it seems as though it doesn't like amd cards.  So what you have to do is go into the AMD Catlyst Control Center and alter the AA to use the applications settings.So with that out of the way,  what I have played so far is very, VERY reminiscent of Painkller, The music, The graphics, it almost seems as though some of the people from the Painkiller team have worked on this project.  It is awesome just the fact that they managed to capture the atmosphere and feeling of Painkiller (just with a Sci-fi setting.) is awesome to me (I am a huge Painkiller fan.)The game looks sharp, the graphics are just really well done, like I had said earlier very reminiscent of Painkiller (more specifically Hell and Damnation.)  The weapons in this game are interesting you have two weapon types N.R.G. and CLN.  The N.R.G. weapons are energy weapons (shocking I know.)  However instead of picking up entirely different weapons you get currency to upgrade the weapon you have (HOLD ON IT GETS COOLER.)  Each of these upgrades makes the weapon take on a different roll (The assault rifle turns into a shotgun and other weapons.)  It is very interesting, however the weapon that you buy shares the ammo for the other weapons (at least from what I have seen so far.)  I can't wait to see what this game has in store for me, I am already in love with it.UPDATE:  I am not a huge fan of the comic bookesque cutscenes.  However that will not affect the score I have given it.  The guns are still awesome I just unlocked a Alternate fire mode for my shotgun, once again very reminiscent of Painkiller,  it fires flak that paralyzes enemies very similar to the shotugun of Painkiller in which the alternate fire mode frezzes enemies.  However it does not kill the enemies instantly like in Painkiller.  Still loving the game.TL:DR It is a really well done classic FPS game and would reccomend grabbing it while it's on sale 8/10			"

IntroductionI wanted to play a shooter again, it had been a while. And here came Hard Reset on a sale, looking like a shooter with cool weapons, retro-gameplay and fancy graphics in a dark megacity setting. Sounded like something I would enjoy.Gameplay and DifficultyI completed the game on Hard and when this game says Hard, it means HARD. I rarely finished a level with under 2-5 deaths, some arenas cost me close to 10 deaths, because I either didn't choose the right weapon upgrades and consequently struggled, or I simply got overwhelmed by a surprise wave of enemies. Hard Reset is pretty simple in terms of game mechanics, the gameplay could be summarized like this:Enter arena. Run around in circles, relentlessly firing, dodging and switching between your poorly performing weapons, while trying to run from hordes of almost endlessly spawning mobs until you run out of ammo and powerups. Die. Try again. Finally beat arena. Proceed through corridor. Get ambushed. Enter next arena. Repeat. Occasionally you have to press buttons to proceed, that's really all there is to it.I'm usually the type for deep and rich gameplay, thinking up clever solutions, progressing tactically. I like games that make you think. This game is nothing like that and I'm aware this sounds like a full-fledged rant so far, BUT: what it does, it does well. The mechanics in place are well balanced, sprinting, jumping, shooting, environment damage, powerup placement and strength, enemy strength vs. weapon damage. It all was balanced with the grand scheme of gameplay in mind. Some arenas feel a bit overdone, the developers just love to throw in waves and waves of mobs, probably to extend the playtime a little more. However, once you learn what enemy types to expect in which quantities and where the powerups are, things get more manageable. And still, each mob does crazy damage, there is little room for mistakes. Mobs also have tons of health and the big boys take quite a bit ammo to take down. Smaller enemies come in larger quantities regularly and still each have quite a bit of health, so you're often better off using the big calibers with AoE for small enemies as well. Enemies mostly feel like bullet sponges - and that's okay to make the game work as it is designed, given the design of arenas and the circumstances of powerups etc. The problem is that the game just doesn't give you the feeling of real weapon impact which is a big factor of fun in most shooters. Not so much here.What's fun on the other hand is the management of space to run, retreating into the right corners, using the right weapons, dodging in the right moments, leaving powerups on the ground until you actually need them, it's all enough to consider to keep the game interesting.Boss battles are well done as a combination of getting swarmed by waves of distractive mobs and having to hit special zones on the boss's body that need to be destroyed to take the boss down.I like the AI in this game because mobs seem to cooperate to take you down. Mobs often run around you through adjacent corridors in order to attack you from all sides. Other than that, the AI is reasonably predictable once you've observed each mob's behaviour.Level designThe level design overall is pretty linear and one-dimensional. Visually most of the game takes place in a dark Blade Runner'esque megacity, most of which is beautifully built. Unfortunately it gets repetitive after a while and leaves you longing for a change. It's not until the Exile DLC expansion that the overall setting changes to a brighter scrapyard wasteland, which to me was a welcome change at that point.Many level elements return quite often, like forklifts blocking paths, while lifting the fork allows you to progess, or optionally powering up or down button panels to open doors. A little more variety wouldn't have hurt here.Quite often you'd bump into invisible walls blocking progress or keeping you from jumping over obstacles. This can be quite tedious when there's only one supposed way to get to a secret, but there's no way to tell where there's a hole in the invisible wall.VerdictSo how does that add up? Let's take a look at the pros and cons:*Pros*+ Graphics are really good, performance is sublime for the visual quality+ Sound is amazing+ Good soundtrack (with a few exceptions)+ Immersive dark and gritty atmosphere+ Fast-paced non-stop action, bug- and glitch-free+ Smooth user interface+ Motivating upgrade system (at least until midgame, in endgame all the necessary weapons and defensive stats are maxed out and there's no more need to upgrade)+ Interesting and tough boss battles, really gets you on your toes+ Good AI - enemy groups split up and try to attack from all sides, even sometimes taking the longer path around an obstacles to sneak at you from behind*Cons*- Often repetitive and easily predictable level design- Few enemy types- Weak weapons (or too tanky enemies)- Often unnecessarily prolonged battles - too many waves of mobs- Some weapons are useless - I almost exclusively used the RPG, Mortar and Railgun and did just fine. Assault Rifle and Plasma Rifle never got used anymore when other weapons were unlocked- Weapon switch times. This game requires frequent weapon switches and there are a few occasions where you just don't have the time to switch weapons. So if you're not prepared, you getting swarmed and you die.- Less than stellar German translation and synchronization- Some annoying songs in the soundtrack- Invisible walls, often annoying placement of N.A.N.O. (currency) requiring you to make fiddly jumps. I sometimes couldn't be bothered.So, do I recommend this game? Overall, yes! Buy it if you don't mind the simplistic gameplay and if you have a high-ish frustration tolerance. Do not buy it if you don't like arena battles and the circumstance of being constantly ambushed, surrounded and swarmed.Overall rating: 79/100			"

												So this is more of a first impression kind of thing I will update this as I play more of the game.  So at first I had trouble getting into the game, it seems as though it doesn't like amd cards.  So what you have to do is go into the AMD Catlyst Control Center and alter the AA to use the applications settings.So with that out of the way,  what I have played so far is very, VERY reminiscent of Painkller, The music, The graphics, it almost seems as though some of the people from the Painkiller team have worked on this project.  It is awesome just the fact that they managed to capture the atmosphere and feeling of Painkiller (just with a Sci-fi setting.) is awesome to me (I am a huge Painkiller fan.)The game looks sharp, the graphics are just really well done, like I had said earlier very reminiscent of Painkiller (more specifically Hell and Damnation.)  The weapons in this game are interesting you have two weapon types N.R.G. and CLN.  The N.R.G. weapons are energy weapons (shocking I know.)  However instead of picking up entirely different weapons you get currency to upgrade the weapon you have (HOLD ON IT GETS COOLER.)  Each of these upgrades makes the weapon take on a different roll (The assault rifle turns into a shotgun and other weapons.)  It is very interesting, however the weapon that you buy shares the ammo for the other weapons (at least from what I have seen so far.)  I can't wait to see what this game has in store for me, I am already in love with it.UPDATE:  I am not a huge fan of the comic bookesque cutscenes.  However that will not affect the score I have given it.  The guns are still awesome I just unlocked a Alternate fire mode for my shotgun, once again very reminiscent of Painkiller,  it fires flak that paralyzes enemies very similar to the shotugun of Painkiller in which the alternate fire mode frezzes enemies.  However it does not kill the enemies instantly like in Painkiller.  Still loving the game.TL:DR It is a really well done classic FPS game and would reccomend grabbing it while it's on sale 8/10			"

												It's not the best FPS around. The story is just plain bad. The visuals are very good and modern, but not always. There are some areas where you find yourself in early 2000's enviroments. It's weird, you can see where they had to cut corners. The guns aren't interesting at all.. they are slow and underpowered.But for a mindless shooter it's alright, I bought it in a sale, so it's a short 5 or 6 hours of shooting the same robots over and over in waves until the big guy show up and you shoot him down.

												If you're a shooter fan (especially twitch shooters) and you haven't picked up Hard Reset yet then curse you for being so blind.  Hard Reset is the baby of Blade Runner and Serious Sam, and it is beautiful.  In fact the game is so gorgeous looking that it easily rivals AAA titles coming out today in the graphical department.  The actual shooting is fast-paced, frantic, and extraordinarily entertaining.  The story is ok to good, but the voice acting is pretty subpar, and further hampered by poor translations.  Of course if you're paying any amount of attention to that crap instead of just mashing 'continue' to get to the next epic setpiece of robot destruction then I don't even know what to tell you.  Go play Skyrim or something.  Nerd.			"

												Yes, a hundred times yes. I had dismissed this game many times when it was first released, and I really regret that. I picked it up just after playing the new Shadow Warrior (from the same dev).This is an absolute classic, old school FPS. The game is set in a stunningly designed cyberpunk future, that will have you staring at all the intricate details in the buildings... right until the waves of cyborg enemies start. Great weapon design, especially the subtle animations as you upgrade your firepower with new modules and switch between them, and all have a great kick to them.Particle effects, explosions, fire - every firefight is a visual delight, especially with elements of the environment aiding in the destruction.If you are a fan of classic old school FPS, do not ignore this game. It's certainly worth its full asking price.			"

												I feel that I'm somewhat contractually obligated to make this recomendation, both on the basis of the Steam Winter Achievement of 2011, and also because Hard Reset is a fun shooter in a very old skool vein.  You get two weapons.  You unlock different 'modes' and other attributes by getting upgrade points, you essentially collect XP, but the real joy comes in the polish and production of a nice, grimy and gritty future that nice Mister Gibson promised us.It's basically a corridor shooter with environmental damage and waves of enemies that border on the absurd.  I've been told that it's short, but I have no clue about this.I heartily recommend this title at the $10 price point.			"

												One of the best examples of FPS action games out there. Only downside is a flat ending. Great difficulty, nice score system, nice story, I can make some critical judgments aside - but honestly - if you enjoy games like COD or Bioshock - this one is very playable and enjoyable. The weapon system is interesting. Two weapons, four fire mode functions and each of those functions have an auxilory function. All of the weapon modes add to gameplay and that's a big deal. When you unlock new functions and what function are choices you make along the way - which change the gameplay.You are also to 'play into the enviroment' by damaging objects for destruction bonus points and AOE damage on enemy swarms. It's worth at least $15 to someone who can appreciate nuanced FPS action. If you play games from start to finish - that in itself is decent in this title. Scenes move forward, the action makes sense. I recommend playing on an advanced difficulty - but whatever floats your boat.			"

												I'm a few hours in playing on hard diff, and I think it's a novel and interesting method of utilising weaponry which creates the need to think ahead, it looks nice it plays smoothly and although it's linear and quite restricted in terms of space, it being quite a confined environment the gameplay works and is designed around this small space combat. I would say it's definitely worth a buy at £3 or £4 pounds or even more if you fancy splashing out I wouldn't disaapointed at spending more thant hat, it's just that there are so many bargains these days. The one tip I would offer is be aware that changing some of your GFX card settings may affect loading and functionality. I changed a few things on Crimson (AMD Card GFX Settings Interface) without thinking and then couldn't see the loading screens or menu screen text at all. If you get that issue just select the ""allow program/game to over ride GFX settings"" in your GFX interface program. Other than that it's a cracking wee romp...			"

This game released ORIGINALLY in 2012 and I played it in 2015, means that maybe there are plenty of updates from the first release. This review is for the 2015 version.GRAPHICSThe graphics was awesome, as another same-class game would do, even better. The shadings and the details in the characters, NPCs and environment are beautifully done. The designs of the characters, NPCs, and anything in the game was great!GAMEPLAYI love the gameplay (I haven't finished the game, tho :v).

												Got this for 2$, but regardless this game is near the thumbs to thumbs in the middle.  If I could give it thumbs in the middle, I would.Story - Intresting story but it's like the Matrix it's a bit complex you get the jist of it.Gameplay -  For a non-AAA title it's overall not bad.Sound -  Good soundGraphics - Great graphics and loved the cyber punk theme of the game.  It's been awhile to admire something like this.Other - Loved the Max Payne comic like cutscenes, really gave the nolstagic feelings.Cons:can't save when you want to, check point only - some check points are a tad tedious.Can't duck, which is sometimes a must especially when taking cover.No armor pick up - the regeneration system is cool but back to point #2 if you can't take cover it's a bit rough and you'll easily get one shotted once your armor is 0.Pretty short game it just hit the the ave of me beating a FPS's (about 10 hours).Worth it if it's on sale, I overall enjoyed it.

												This game is awesome!  It takes the classic 90's FPS formula and updates it for the modern generation.  Kinda like what Serious Sam did, but takes it in a different direction.  Its constant action, but to survive requires second-to-second strategy, recognizing enemy ai patterns and the perfect weapon to use for each element of an encounter.  During a single battle, i'd switch between 3-4  weapons atleast, and sometimes more to perfect the strategy.  I like how the ammo system works, so you can concentrate on which weapon is the best to do the job instead of constantly rationing the best weapons incase there is an extreme scenario down the line that needs it.  Also, the checkpoint system was tweaked just right so I don't need to save/load spam to beat an area, and gives a good opportunity to think of a new strategy to enter a battle with each time I die, just like classic side scroller games did.

 Hard Reset combines a new-age look with old-FPS values, creating the most unique looking bullet hell you'll probably ever play.   7.5/10 Calling this game ""Flashy"" would be an understatement. Every combat situation is a lightshow and you're the conductor. Shooting enemies with both your Ballistic and Energy weapons feels incredibly satisfying, both gun types being different enough to have their own personalities. The destructible environment, while not as satisfying as the gunplay, makes the scenery feel more realistic to the dark and dreary dystopian future. On the downside, the story is nothing to write home about, and though the gunplay is satisfying most of the time, other times it can feel repetitive. Despite this, I would recommend this game to my friends. It sets itself apart from the pack by having a unique look and feel. And in moderation, quite a fun time.			"

												Kind of like ""Serious Sam,"" only more focused on enclosed battles than  arena fights and a lot shorter (so also a lot less repetitive). It does have its flaws (level design is a bit linear, story is incomprehensible, it uses a checkpoint system rather than quicksaves, the environments get a bit same-ish after the first few levels), but overall I think the positives outweigh the negatives: interesting variety of weapons, an upgrade system which can't be fully maxed out the first go around (so your game will change depending on which load out you take), very well constructed battles which are different enough from each other to hold your interest, and just the right level of difficulty which will have you thinking as the game continually one ups itself with each successive battle, ""Holy ♥♥♥♥, there's no way I can get past this area"" just minutes before you do, in fact, get past it.Play on ""Insane"" or don't play at all.

												This game is pretty cool!  It is a Future Man Vs Machine FPS game.  The graphics are awesome and the way things blow up with peices going every where is even better.  The controls are good, the lighting is good, and best of all ~ the gameplay is pretty fun.The only downfall is that it ended after 4 hours and I wish the game had more effective weapons.  Once I got the smart gun I pondered why would I use anything else unless i was surrounded by tons of little bots.  The set up will remind you a bit of Serious Sam or PainKiller ~ because everytime you pick up goodies or cross a border into a new room.... expect to get jumped by robots.Better than I expected and worth the price tag.  A word of warning ~ do not buy this game expecting some awesome story or if you prefer shooting people.  In this game you never actually see another moving person and you only fight robots in furturistic areas with futuristic guns.			"

												Hard Reset feels like an old school FPS laced with modern graphics and special effects. The game itself is very well made and one can easily see the meticulous effort that went into designing the environments, enemies, and the weapons. Hard Reset offers a superb visual experience, but falls short in presenting an interesting narrative - a prominent issue in most contemporary video games. Is it worth the full retail price? Probably not, considering the very short campaign and lack of multiplayer. If you want to play this game, I would recommened you buy it on sale or play it on someone else's computer.			"

												Hard Reset is a throwback to oldschool FPS where reloading is nonexistent, enemies are numerous and the explosions are more important than the story. This mishmash of fast paced action with spliced in comic book story scenes between levels does a good job of creating an interesting environment but also one you're not going to get too attached to. That's good since the game is actually quite short, although made significantly longer if you own the DLC. The game has only two weapons, but as you progress you can purchase weapon attachments and upgrades, essentially giving you a total of 10 weapons to play with, in addition to a number of armor and utility upgrades. The action is fast, the guns are fun and satisfying to use, and the game is hard. Very hard. In fact even if you're a veteran it may behoove you to start on a lower difficulty until you get used to it because this game is completely unforgiving. There's no regenerating health or ammo, the enemies do a lot of damage, they're relentless, and you will die extremely fast if surrounded.For the low prices this game goes for nowadays there's not really a way I can't recommend this. If you enjoy oldschool FPS like Doom, Quake or Duke Nukem (or even semi-modern ones like Serious Sam) you'll probably enjoy Hard Reset. If not, it's hard to say. Either way you can probably find the game for a couple dollars either in a bundle or on sale and if you do I'd say it's well worth the money.With Hard Reset: Redux out you'll probably want to take a look at that instead.

Buy on saleThis game is pretty fun for what it is. Think Duke Nukem 3D and Serious Sam, minus the wit. Think Dark Forces II, minus the compelling story. Think DOOM, minus horror and viscera. Think Painkiller, minus the creative arsenal.There's a lot to dislike about this gameEverything feels super-generic and samey, and billing this game as a classic run-and-gun FPS I suppose abates any complaint I could have about it being a bare bones, no-frills experience. The bad guys are somewhat dull and limited in variety. The graphics are muddy and vague and can make it hard to tell exactly what you're shooting at. The music is mediocre buttrock that maniacally swings from intense to anemic depending on enemy proximity, The level design takes a page from its predecessors, nonsensical and labyrinthian, not very engaging or immersive.But...That said, this game plays smooth as butter on velvet, getting 75-80 FPS on my mid-grade gaming tower. The weapon assortment while limited and simple feels good. The combat can sometimes be repetitive but feels very satisfying and fluid. The entire world is rife with destructible elements that you can shoot for a rewarding, over-the-top level of destruction. Despite the blandness that surrounds practically every aspect of this game, Hard Reset plays fantastically.Ultimately, if this game is on sale for under $5, and you want to shoot robo-dudes for a couple hours, pick this up. It's worth that price. "

The graphics look good, what I've seen of the story so far is pretty good, destroying the enviroment is fun, the level design and the hidden secrets everywhere make me want to explore.This is not a game that requires you to use your brain, which (in this case) is a good thing.Of course the game isn't perfect, but it is pretty damn close. It has a good sense of humor. In most games I skip the cutscenes but in this game they are worth watching.The game is not afraid to kill you once in a while, and I appreciate that.There are many save points and it is easy to find your way. The secrets are not difficult to find.The sound design is pretty good and the weapons are fun to use (I prefer using the rifle). I like using the enviroment to my advantage.I turned the screen brightness up by 10% and I disabled the aim assist.			"

Deus Ex meets Serious Sam. The weapon and skill variety isn't *quite* as good as Shadow Warrior nor is the story and voice acting worth writing home about, but other than those few flaws it's a solid retro-inspired FPS in a cyberpunk setting that I'd have no problem recommending to the right people.

												The story is your generic post-apocalyptic survival stuff, but with an old school shooter around it - the story is not too taxing and quite fitting. The shooting is INCREDIBLY satisfying and the game looks absolutely gorgeous. Levels might be a bit too linear for someones' tastes, but they are very beautiful. The soundtrack and atmosphere are very cool. Overall Hard Reset is a very nice package full of action!			"

												Spectacular coloring a graphics for a 2012 game. Good action and a unique way of revealing the plot.  Switching of weapon function and weapon 'theme"" is also refreshing to see among the numerous FPSs out there. As a shooter, however, it is mechincally awkward as it seems that as a player one will get stuck on everything from a garbage can to the side of a car or a small railing. It makes it difficult to dodge charging enemies, especially in narrow coridors.  Confined spaces... I want to jump that bloody gate that is only 1.5' high... I want to explore. Not so in Hard Reset.Small but unique diversity of enemy robots. I'd recommend the game  when on sale under $10			"

												One of those weird games that tries to be all ""Classic FPS"" by throwing a bunch of enemies at you, while drinking the ""Nintendo Hard is fun!"" kool-aid that people try to force, seasoned by ""Hey, lets push PC Hardware to the limit!"" development.Regarding that last statement, that was more true a few years ago. Nowadays, if you've built a PC in the past three years, your computer will stomp and♥♥♥♥♥♥all over this game. Back then, though, it was kind of like ""Whoaaaa! Look at those particle effects!""It is very short, and while I had fun with it, it felt artificially difficult. The story was absolutely not worth following, not in the least bit, but considering that not enough FPS games have this sort of ""kill a bunch of dudes that aren't army dudes and don't really take yourself seriously but we'll have a serious story anyway"" kind of style anymore, this can be a refreshing jaunt through the sci-fi woods.Full price? Eh. Sale price? Abso-lutely!			"

												I've never had this much fun playing an arena shooter b4. Familiar enough, in the 'running circles/kiting' enemies as you blast em. Yet, a very different experience in the Cyber-punk world of it all and with the 2x weapons you have, that morph into other weapons. Assault Rifle = Shotgun/G. Launcher/Rocket L./Proxi Mine. All of which can be upgraded (+suit upgrades) and get a 2ndary fire and 'that' is where the game differs. In the combinations of Weaponry/abilitys you can use with the environment, to defeat the ruthless hordes of Cyber-Machinery charging your way.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine  PLEASE NOTE: I recommended this game with some exceptions, overall if the game did not live up to just a tiny expectation, I would not have recommended it at all, so please read the review carefully if you are thinking of buying/playing this game Hard Reset is developed by Flying Wild Hog, the people behind Shadow Warrior and its upcoming sequel. Hard Reset was developed before Shadow Warrior and you can tell that the company did not have as much of a bigger budget as Shadow Warrior didThe story basically follows a dystopian world where robots have taken over by a sophisticated A.I., you play a major known as Fletcher, throughout the story you have to try and find out the reasons why the robots have turned against the humans and stop those who are responsible. The story is very cliche and does follow what many other sci-fi films back in the day managed to achieveThe environments are absolutely stunning, and the lighting effects in particular really make the enviornments come alive. The explosions also play a big role in Hard Reset and really make the game more explosive in its action, however, even though I have a PC that can run it on ultra settings, I did suffer with some minor frame rate drops when there was a lot of action going about. Now, I don't know what the developers where trying to go through the environments, but the game really reminded me of Blade Runner, a sci-fi thriller classic. The high rise buildings, the flying cars and that Chinese/Japanese (sorry can't tell the difference) adevertising on large blimps, I think the developers where heavily inspired by Blade Runner when they were designing Hard ResetTalking about game performance, this game does suffer with poor game performance. Sometimes the game freezes monetarily even in heavy combat areas, this may be due to the high amounts of enemies and explosive effects taking placeThe A.I., the game's difficulty changes drastically, especially in the last bit of the main story and then the rest of the DLC story, I first played on Normal difficulty and it was so annoying that I died so many times that I had to lower it to the Easy difficulty which lowered the amount of times I died and these robots sure do have precision aim shooting, because in Hard Reset they have precision aim shooting!The music and sound effects were okay but what really made me happy was that whilst playing, it did remind me of Blade Runner quite a lot!Like previously said, you will die, a lot, thankfully there is a fair checkpoint system in the game. The voice acting was bad and I mean really bad. You can tell that in Shadow Warrior they had a bigger budget because at least in that game the voice acting was good, in Hard Reset, they were really bad. The only good performance I would say was from the professor, nobody elseThe gunplay is okay, nothing special though. I think the game was also heavily inspired by old shooters like DOOM, as it does try to bring in that same formula to Hard ResetLastly, what really made me not want to continue playing was the re-use of the enemies. I don't know how many times I saw the same enemies over and over again every single time through my whole playthrough. It really made me not want to continue playing... Plus, what is up with the endings!? The main story's ending is really bad and ends on a huge cliffhanger leaving you helpless as to what has just happened and what will happen, thankfully Flying Wild Hog made an extended edition which includes the Exile DLC for free which continues the main game. But even that ending, it has that ending of, ""Oh, don't worry, everything will be explained in due time"", and just ends like that...I had fun playing Hard Reset, even though it did have its fair share of problems here and there, but on the whole, it was a really good action game. I wouldn't recommend Hard Reset for its full asking price as I feel it does not satisfy me to pay full price, but if it is in a sale, price drop, etc... I would definitely recommend you buying it, if you love sci-fi or Blade Runner or both like me RECOMMENDED :)  "

												An FPS with stunning, highly detailed environments created by the same company that brought you the latest shadow warrior (another great game, but less options (quicksave) than this one).  Though initially it has a dreaded savepoint system, with the changes to the config files, discoverd by http://steamcommunity.com/id/gwelty, you can save at any time. You can also change the difficulty at any time (for me I have to set it to easy most of the time :-) ).This plays like the old shooters (including saving at any time) but with today's (or tomorrows) graphics.The best shooter I played in a decade.

												Hard Reset gets a 8.5/10 from me, it's a good game. The only reason why there are some negative reviews is that this game is oldschool, meaning that you actually need skill and reflexes with a bit of tactic to survive. So if you're a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ casual go back to your cave, if you want a good oldschool shooter that rewards skill rather than grind, hard reset is the game for you.Let's start with the story: You are a cop/merc that has to kill all robots, thats basically it.Graphics:  The levels are colorful and the graphics of this game are awesome, lots of ligth effects, screenshake, uber physics, you can basically destzory everthing that is not attached to another object.Enemies: A bit monotone but require reflexes and the right tactic. Gunplay feels good, with some weapons being less rewarding than others, overall motivation is also good, exploring levels is quite well rewarded and you always look for more upgrades.I picked this game up for 3 bucks and had awesome fun with it, wish there were more games with this palystyle and graphics today, you won't find a better shooter for this price at the moment, devs even gave out a DLC for it.

												Warsaw based studio Flying Wild Hog, are no strangers to FPS-games, rather, they are connoisseurs of the genre who know how gamer hearts work. In Hard Reset, they have managed to combine the spirit and feel of the old school shooter with amazing graphics, and it is a wild ride, if not for a lifetime, then for at least 10 - 15 hours if you are an acheivement hunter and if you love action.In the Extended Edition of the game, you get the DLC Exile for free, which is quite generous in these times. Previous Hard Reset-owners can also download the DLC for free, which keeps the action going for at least two more hours.Storywise, there is nothing new here, which is actually something I really liked about the game. You go from one scene to another, knowing exactly what you should do, just like in the old days; so be prepared to use your tiggerfinger alot.POSITIVE:+ Sharp and crisp visuals.+ Fairly lenghty campaign.+ Nice audio.NEGATIVE:- Menu (hard to switch weapons fast sometimes).- Voice acting is OK.- You can’t run and jump at the same time.If you are looking for a nice looking shooter to get you through the day, you need to play Hard Reset.

												A cyberpunk shooter by (some of) the makers of Painkiller, and very much in that style (that is, old-school shoot-em-up).  Looks great, and the levels are well-designed. The upgrade system is a little wonky: you have two guns, which can each be upgraded into other types of guns within that guns' style.  One is an energy weapon, the other a conventional rifle: the energy weapon is upgraded into a rail gun, &c. while the rifle can be upgraded into an RPG, shotgun &c., with about 10 different weapons in total with most all having an alternate firing mode.  These were relatively easy to switch between, but tedious to scroll through (I would advise using the bound keys for specific guns early, as I used the mouse scroll and ended up blowing myself up with the RPG several times intending to use the shotgun).The story is mostly non-existent.  One gets the feeling that they ran out of funding, or something, as the cut scenes are all hand drawn (as though they were still storyboards), and the plot seems half-cocked at best (I could not even begin to tell you what the story is about).  But it, appropriately, goes mostly unnoticed, taking a backseat to the gameplay.tl;dr: Story sucks, but looks good and plays about as well.I'd give it a B			"

												After 3 hours of playing, and managing to get to the fourth level, I can say that this game is definitely not an average shooter. It is difficult and requires swift movement and weapon switching for the situation at hand. It is well-optimized, only losing FPS on cramped areas with lots of explosives. It also features a brutal checkpoint system that CAN and WILL punish you for failing to observe your surroundings and dying stupid deaths. It is also king enough to save right before encountering a new enemy type so you can learn the strategy without needing to wade through robots again.Secrets are scattered throughout the levels and can require out of the box thinking, platforming, and use of environmental hazards to reach.Gameplay: 8/10Visuals: 9.7/10Replay-Value: 5/10Overall: 8.7/10			"

												Positives: :: Georgeous graphics and art style, very immersive, it reminds of Bioshock in that aspect.:: Guns feel great, lots of visual feedback with screen shakes and effects.:: Lots of gun modes and upgrades.:: Boss battles are pretty good, as good as any.:: Very much a PC shooter, there's no console nonsense, mouse control feels snappy, movement is great, no ADS crap. (This is important nowadays)Negatives::: Story is pretty much incomprehensible, and doesn't look interesting either.:: Boring enemies, they're robots for one and they look like some kind of equipment, not at all menacing in any way. Just bad.:: Repetitive, to me that's to be expected, painkiller gets repetitive and so does serious sam, so I don't really mind that, however it's not helped by factors like enemy, gun design or level variety, so it's perhaps even more repetitive than those games are, the level design in particular is a problem, the first half of the game looks like one level.

This game released ORIGINALLY in 2012 and I played it in 2015, means that maybe there are plenty of updates from the first release. This review is for the 2015 version.GRAPHICSThe graphics was awesome, as another same-class game would do, even better. The shadings and the details in the characters, NPCs and environment are beautifully done. The designs of the characters, NPCs, and anything in the game was great!GAMEPLAYI love the gameplay (I haven't finished the game, tho :v).

 Hard Reset combines a new-age look with old-FPS values, creating the most unique looking bullet hell you'll probably ever play.   7.5/10 Calling this game ""Flashy"" would be an understatement. Every combat situation is a lightshow and you're the conductor. Shooting enemies with both your Ballistic and Energy weapons feels incredibly satisfying, both gun types being different enough to have their own personalities. The destructible environment, while not as satisfying as the gunplay, makes the scenery feel more realistic to the dark and dreary dystopian future. On the downside, the story is nothing to write home about, and though the gunplay is satisfying most of the time, other times it can feel repetitive. Despite this, I would recommend this game to my friends. It sets itself apart from the pack by having a unique look and feel. And in moderation, quite a fun time.			"

												Ok, I've finally had a chance to play this (to completion) and would say that this title is along the lines of painkiller. You are presented with hordes of enemies during your playthrough of a level and it is up to your personal skill to blow everything to smitherines. It has sound elements which seem remarkably familiar to me in the veins of DOOM and Half Life.The story line is a bit dis-jointed and the cut scenes leave you wondering whether it is possible for the game to get any more disjointed in it's story telling lolol. As for someone like me who like a good storyline.... it was frustrating!!!Despite this, I do enjoy the mindless shooters where you have nothing else to rely on except fast reflexes and your wits. however the another frustrating point was the weapon switching.,... It was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ IRRITATING to not have the weapons switch to what you want in a timely matter. It forces you to go through the full animation sequence of loading a  weapon apparently before you can switch to another weapon... so  y ou better make sure you chose the right one the first time!!!Aside from this, the game does have replayability only in the sense of wanting to test/refine your skills of disposal of those blasted robots in increasing difficulty levels.Overall, the title feels like it fell just short of greatness. It has a mix of both good and bad elements to the it, however it warrants a look at if you are a fan of the raw shoot 'em ups.			"

												Hard Reset is a great throwback to the old school fps genre of game. It has a nice sleek look with great graphics, with simple but satisfying gunplay that anyone would be hard pressed to find something to complain about. It's a fantastic budget shooter, that I would recommend to anyone.			"

												I was introduced to this game when I overheard a known idiot say ""it only has 2 guns"". Know this person like I do I immediately purchased this game.It only has 2 guns. 2 upgradeable guns with unique firing modes and shared ammo types. This forces you into being a bit conservative with ammo even though you'll never really be held back. Also, having an RPG that follows your laser is awesome.If only Fletcher's voice actor was better, if only the story made more sense, if only I got to play some of the scenes depicted in the animatics - this would be a blockbuster.

												The Good: Excellent visuals, interesting weaponsThe Bad: Frustratingly difficult, broken weapon system, repetitive enemies, very linear, uninteresting story, messy cut scenesHard Reset is a cyberpunk game set in the future about a war between AI machines and humans. You are an agent of the CLN trying to stop this, but the story is kind of just vaguely tossed together and doesn't really make any sense. You also don't get much sense of what's going on in the world. The characters are uninteresting, and the messy comic style cut scenes are uninspired and sloppy. Besides this the game has some solid shooting, but even that has issues of its own.There are only two guns and each one has its own different ""add-ons"". The energy weapons let you shoot plasma, mortars, a smartgun which shoots through walls, and EMP grenades. The CLN gun has a machine gun, RPG, shotgun, and grenade launcher. This is great and all, but this system is flawed. Switching between two weapons and then to the right attachment is stupid. Not only are the gun switching animations slow, but having to do this costs precious seconds in which you're dying. This also rolls into the biggest problem with the game: It's too damn hard. Sure I like a challenge, but just a few hits and you're dead, but there are tons of enemies thrown at you and they don't go down easy. Expect to restart dozens of times almost during every fight unless you're on easy.Why would a game have a weapon system that works against itself? Who knows. You can buy these attachments and upgrade them by finding XP lying around everywhere, but the progression is slow and by the end of the game you will barely have bought 10 upgrades. My other complaint is that there are only about 6 different types of robots you can shoot and it gets old very fast. The first couple of levels are pretty awesome then that wears out when you get to your first fight where you die about 10 times.There are a couple of boss fights, but they are almost impossible to beat on any difficulty but easy. I haven't played such a hard FPS that I can remember. It actually makes the game not very fun at all, and even the most skilled players will struggle. I can't even believe they put an insane mode in here. One hit and you're dead which makes it impossible to go past the first fight in the game. Go figure. The objectives are all the same with you pressing this button, shut down this thing to go past that thing. There are secret areas you can find to improve your end of level score, but who really cares? You'll be lucky if you can get through the damn game.The game looks pretty damn good with a nice Blade Runner type art style, but it's wasted on linear levels. The overall feeling of the world has lots of potential with kiosks hocking items in robotic/half failing voices, holograms with propaganda and ads everywhere. I like the style, but it sure went to waste. Overall Hard Reset is a decent shooter for a weekend sit down, but the extreme difficulty practically kills it. There's also not multiplayer which is a surprise so after you finish the game once you probably won't go back.~Score: 7/10			"

												An excellent modern-made throwback to the more arcade-style shooters of the 90s. It looks great (it runs quite well too), it plays better. The developers pulled off the cyberpunk theme very well and fighting the ""mutant robots"" as I would call has never been this much fun. The design decision on two physical weapons that morph into multiple different functional weapons is an interesting and pleasing approach to the ""this dude can carry 20 different weapons"" factor. This game, at higher difficulty levels, is also very challenging. Experienced and older fans of the genre will find themselves at home amidst the dystopian city. Definitely recommended, download the demo to see what its all about.			"

												Hard Reset caught some flack for being a relatively short game with a small variety of enemies that don't do anything more than the one or two actions they make.HOWEVER!  These are the only real problems these reviewers actually have with the title.  To them, I say ""Phooey"".  Hard Reset is a wonderful arcade-y shooter game that's focused on obliterating a lot of robots while moving, shooting and running constantly through a very well designed futuristic city.  It's incredibly linear with the occasional small alleyway or fence that hides some bonus points, but this is perfect for how the game is meant to be.  It keeps you going and shooting, and the enemies get varied at the correct times, and they spawn in the perfect places to make for a challenging and fun experience.  I love the world, I love the feel, I love the art (especially the city), and I love the game.Quick note:  The story is extremely weak, but the story shouldn't be the focus of a game of this type anyway.  Solid 8 or 9/10.  There is NO reason to not pick this title up if Steam throws it on sale (which happens quite often).			"

												Even though the story, enemy diversity and creativity and storyboard style cutscenes are not the greatest, the level details and innovative weapons make up for it. The levels were clear and easy to follow. I really did enjoy this game. Only downside is that it doesn't give you the chance to replay the game and keep the weapons you upgraded.			"

												Fantastic old school shooter. The story isn't great and you're going to be pressing a lot of buttons but man is the combat good. The initial hour of gameplay starts off slow and then things really pick up. I played through on normal the first time and then played again on Insane. The second time through you can keep your upgrades and continue to upgrade until you max out everything. On the harder difficulty you'll find yourself switching between your different weapons in order to survive. You can't just spam rockets or spam rail guns to win. You have to use your arsenal along with the environment to make it through.This is one of the most fun games I've played in a long time. Hope you enjoy it.			"

												I bought this for a little over a dollar. It was worth it for that. The gameplay was really repetitive. You keep shooting until the enemies are dead. This style of gameplay works better with more space to manuever. Most of the areas you're fighting in are pretty narrow and don't really lend themselves well to this style of gameplay. Sometimes the levels are dark and you can barely tell the difference between what's dead, what's environmental and what's coming towards you. The level design could be a little bit better. Sometimes, I'd be stuck and have no idea what I was supposed to do next. I thought the actual world of the game were very interesting though. I thought it was an interesting backdrop and made up for the relative lack of narrative. I also really enjoyed how seamless controlling the environment was in the user interface.So if you can get it for dollar or two, it's good for a couple hours of gameplay.			"

All of which can be upgraded (+suit upgrades) and get a 2ndary fire and 'that' is where the game differs. In the combinations of Weaponry/abilitys you can use with the environment, to defeat the ruthless hordes of Cyber-Machinery charging your way.			"

												One of the funniest FPS I have ever player. I liked the cyberpunk setting. The gameplay is a bit frantic and it's like a ""tactical"" weapon shooter, in the sense that you have to carefully choose and swap your weapon before enemy encoutnering in order to eliminate enemies far from your position (es: using mortars). Otherwise they are a lot and quickly surrond you!.For Eur 5 it's the best I bought in years . My mark for this game: 5/5Have fun!			"

												A hidden gem among indie PC exclusives. This is an underrated game that deserves your attention. Picked it up on sale for $3 thinking it would be some half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ low-optimization time waster. Man was I wrong about that. Hard Rest is easily worth the full $15 price tag. Sure, the voice acting could use some work, but I do love the comic book aesthetic of the cutscenes through which the story is told.Highly recommended for fans of futuristic first-person shooters and cyberpunk games. Hell, you should pick this up even if you aren't into the whole cyberpunk thing. At a regular price of $15, and a discount price of $3, there's really no reason not to buy it. You really don't know what you're missing here. If you aren't convinced yet (or just don't want to believe me), then I suggest you download the demo and see the quality for yourself.			"

												I bought this game with high expectations, it retails for $15, and I got it for $3.75.I started it up, menus were promising, graphics good, weapon animations nice, interesting game mechanic, and then the story showed up, and it was HORRIBLE. Just a very bad plot on this one. But later on you find other issues, such as when you fail a boss / level / wave or enemys, it often puts you back at the last *checkpoint* which happens to be several ""waves"" back. And it is really annoying. The enemys are kind of fun at first, though not much explanation is given about ANYTHING, however later on the enemys just become problematic for getting to the next checkpoint, and overall just a nucence, not something I WANT to kill, but just something in my way.

Second, this is a thoroughly enjoyable game. Really nice graphics, good atmosphere (note the floating advertising ships, remind you of anything?), fun combat. As noted by many others, weapon management is key. This is not a complicated game by any standard, but running in guns blazing without thought will get you killed. Find a combo that works and get to work. About 80% through the game now, my favorite is the gravity grenade / railgun, because, railgun!The graphic novel bits have a nice feel to them, but the lines the main character produces would make Duke Nukem cringe. He appears to have the intellect of a buttermilk pancake without syrup.Bottomline, if you like FPS, get Hard Reset at this ridiculous price,			"

												Cyberpunk asthetic, beautiful graphics, and intense gameplay make for a thrilling FPS.Hard Reset sets out to let you slaughter tons of robots in a series of thrilling encounters throughout a gorgeous cyberpunk city, and it does so with style. From the main menu to the upgrade stations, everything carries the futuristic cyberpunk asthetic, which greatly enhances the atmosphere. The city and robot design are gorgeous, and with a great use of color, lighting, and effects. You have two weapons to quickly switch between, and each weapon can morth into upto four different guns, such as an assault rifle, shotgun, grenade launcher, and rocket launcher. As you progress you can unlock additional modes for each gun and upgrades for each mode.The battles are fast, furious, and intense. Circle strafe and keep moving, as standing still will get you killed. I found the normal difficulty perfect, challenging enough to make every fight intense, but I would only die maybe once per level. Additional checkpoints have been added since release to minimize repeating encounters upon death. The game is a good length, wrapping up before it becomes repetitive or outlives its welcome.The main faults I found were the lack of a manual save - I shouldn't have to rely on checkpoints - and that the story was rather confusing and mostly told between levels.

												Il gioco è un FPS old school che piacerà certamente ad un pubblico con qualche anno  di esperienza videoludica. GIà solo il particolare dell'energia che non si rigenera e il numero di armi trasportabili, dimostrano quanti richiami di videogiochi del passato siano presenti in Hard Reset. Il motore grafico è molto fluido anche su configurazioni non nuovissime. Il gameplay è ottimo e perfettamente calibrato per mouse e tastiera. Se il gioco fosse stato un po' più lungo e con una storia più appagante, sarebbe stato perfetto. Con l'uscita della versione extended probabilmente molte incertezze verranno eliminate. Durante i saldi piuttosto che acquistare la solita roba di produzione tripla A, tenete presente anche Hard Reset che ha ben poco da invidiare, anzi. Speriamo in altre produzioni di Flying Wild Hog; il team è composto da veterani del settore, il risultato finale è molto buono e promette molto bene anche lo sviluppo di nuovi titoli.			"

												So far so good for this fps game made by Flying War Hog, i am seriously impress. Mixing sci-fi and comic panels a la Sin City or Max Payne, it is quite fun and entertaining. I have tried it at normal and the difficulty is quite there. You have an array of different weapons you can upgrade and you have to sometimes use your head to discover secret places. All in all, it is a nice discovery for a real low price. I do definitly recommend this game.			"

												Hard reset is a truly solid game that will leave you feeling whole upon completion. it's a pure and simple game and doesn't water down gameplay or awkwardly break the flow of the game with animations or cutscenes. the story is good and the art is fantastic. it doesn't have too much in the way of replayability but with 12 or so hours of gameplay it will definitely keep you entertained for it's moneys worth.

												This game was pretty fun, and very big on the whole Cyberpunk atmosphere. It is a FPS and not really long, but the levels can be difficult at times. You are easily able to be overran with enemies, and although frustrating at times, it was an overall good game. As you go through the levels, the way you obtain items can be tricky but as long as you dont put your main focus on them its fun. Some obstacles I had to really think of how to get to the item that I could see. Tthe path was not always easily seen. in the end, I really enjoyed the game and dont feel like it was wasted money! I got this game before a Redux version was available, and I really dont think I need the Redux version...Im content with what I played!			"

Several secrets to find.Somewhat repetitive in places, although that was exacerbated by the fact that I kept dying due to the difficulty level.  Fair few bullet sponge enemies.  Don't expect a coherent story. Go for the rocket launcher!  If only I'd had it early on...			"

Deus Ex meets Serious Sam. The weapon and skill variety isn't *quite* as good as Shadow Warrior nor is the story and voice acting worth writing home about, but other than those few flaws it's a solid retro-inspired FPS in a cyberpunk setting that I'd have no problem recommending to the right people.

												Hard Reset is a simple First Person Shooter with interesting graphics. It's set in a ""Terminator"" style universe where machines have taken over from humans. The graphics are interesting - sort of cartoon like. I played the single player campaign and the robots tend to attack by ambush and at times in waves.  Winning these fights involves (limited) ammo management, health management (finding medkits) and choosing the right weapon for the job. I found the shotgun to be good for the swarm attacks, with the plasma (NRG) weapon, particularly the railgun and smartgun, good for the larger enemies.On the downside, the dialogue is awful. The designers overused profanity. Some of the cartoon cutscenes are undecipherable scribbles. Some of the plot nuances were a bit lost on me - the protagnist seems to have some ability to absorb multiple personalties?  This wasn't explained very well.Levelling up in this game consists of collecting orange ""Nanos"" which eventually allow you to select either a weapon, shield or tactical upgrade. That's it.  This makes the game rather one-dimensional. However, if you enjoy a fast paced FPS then you're sure to enjoy this game. It is getting a bit repetitive/monotonous however. Oh, there are bosses which can sometimes be a bit tricky to work out how to defeat.			"

												Yeah, it's a keeper.  To get this game on sale for a buck fitty, it's worth it.  Fun way to spend some hours if you are feeling the itch for some dark shooter type of game. Lots of robots and cyborgs, fast paced and intense, weapons are pretty neat and you can upgrade them along with some gear upgrades.  It even came with DLC included for the same price but I have not gotten to that part yet. It runs pretty good on my old laptop on high settings, but will run very well on a modern machine at max settings.  Very good delivery on the theme of the game, the dialogue is set up like a comic strip in parts and is not real in depth which I like.  No boring story with a bunch of dramatic chit-chat, just straight to business and killing robots.  Quality headphones and a dark room will instantly draw you in to the feel of this game.  Would I pay full price for this game?  Nah, but I feel real good about buying it at 90% off and would highly encourage others to do the same while it's still on sale. I'm glad I got it.			"

												Hard Reset is a pretty good time. The design is very old school, much like the Painkiller games. You're dealing with a lot of enemies, coming from all directions, and each is best handled with a different strategy. On the higher difficulties the game is absolutely ruthless, requiring you to take note of and use all environmental damage sources (explosive barrels, etc), which are scattered liberally around the levels.My few gripes include a rather slow movement speed that makes it extremely difficult to dodge certain enemies and projectiles, and an odd damage representation system. The screen becomes difficult to make out after you take damage, leaving your actual health total a mystery. In addition, even after picking up health (and perhaps returning to your maximum) the screen remains difficult to read for a few moments.			"

												Enemy selection is pretty decent. good spread of HP values and attacks. Bosses were so-so.Level design was decent. Lots of exploding barrels everywhere. Kiting to an earlier part of the level and spamming bombs at a chokepoint happened a bit too much for my taste, but getting locked in an arena filled barrels and different enemy types never got old. Art was better than I expected, but always felt pretty generic shootery.Campaign about 10 hours long. About as long as you'd want it to be, considering you're facing souped version of old enemies by then. Plot is nothing to write home about.Gun selection is the big strongpoint. Many unique, very fun weapons to unlock. Had lots of fun getting ricochet kills with the grenade launcher.			"

												Okay so heavy reset in a nutshell: It is one of those awesome, fun,  action packed, shooters that are a rare joy these days.Set in a future where there are lots of robots that apparently are not nice, you blow them up with either energy based weapons on classic projectiles.The visuals still look good today. The sound is very good and the game play is awesome.The combat is really unique because it mixes classis shooting where you want to keep moving and weapons and enviromnetal items that are used for crowd control. It's not quite old school, but it has the feel too it. I highly reccomend that you download the demo and give it a try.			"
