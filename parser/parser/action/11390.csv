												Buggy mess...but for 69p......bargin, i think the bugs are funny, nice car models and the game doesnt take it self too seriously, I laughed my balls off at the guy putting on the u.s. accent with the voice acting, Game is fun and thats what it aimed for and ive had plenty of laughs from it, you get a sense of speed, lots of cars i just dont get why someone would give this a thumbs down because its great, graphics are nice and it even runs on my crap laptop. Not sure about the price but on sale you def gotta pick this one up just to laugh at the bugs or the fact that you chase bad guys smashing up there cars as a policeman. Like i said, nice graphics, good sound, great fps and lots of cars, freeroam, slowmo crashes, missions and bugs... a steal if its on sale trust me.Overall 6.5/10.			"

												I just gave this game a try since it pretends to be an ""open-world driving game"", and that got me curious. Alas, after just over one hour of trying to come to grips with it, I have to admit I give up on it. It's not an awfully bad game, far from it. The graphics are more than decent, considering it's a game from 2009. On the highest settings (not that there are that many settings...), the cars look nice and the environment is more or less ok - bar the awful pop-ups in front of you of several objects. The driving model is fair, nothing special, but when played with a controller it feels fine. The music, as so often with this type of game, is all too repetitive for my taste so I switched it almost immediately off. There are some possibilities for adding your own music tracks to the game, so for those interested in this, the game offers something extra.The bad thing about the game is the ""gameplay"" - actually, there hardly is any, at least I did not find much of it. There are several modes: a free patrol mode, in which I searched in vain for anything to-do other than driving through a generic-looking city with roadsigns that kept saying ""Köln 2300m"" all the time. You can do a normal city race, which is fine for just a quick try, but the ""story mode"" is what lets the game down. The various objectives are simply hilariously difficult - most of the time one has to damage an opponent to 100%, but whenever he gets further away than 200m, the mission has to be restarted. Since the AI miraculously can teleport itself down bridges or through walls, this got me first staring in disbelief and then lauging out loud. I guess this game can be fun to some, but to me it's a no-go: there are simply too many other good games out there, including large-scale racing games, to put any more time into this.Overall score: 3.5/10			"

												""I don't have any argument but I don't like it !"" -Bad reviews from a random lowbob. 0/10""Like Skyrim with Polizei."" -IGN 2/10""Polizei, oktoberfest, ausfarht, dummkopfs."" -Medic 11/10So, first of all, this game doesn't deserve all those bad reviews. Everyone seems to have played this game for only 15 minutes, and honestly, you can't judge a game within 15 minutes. This game reviews are clearly manichaean ; you have two possibilities according to Steam reviews : you completly disregarded it because you played a few minutes and no minigun spawned on your car or you will find this game ""somewhat OK"". In my honest opinion, I really liked this game. Of course, there is tons of better game in that game style, like the FlatOut series, but this game got a decent amount of pros. Let me make a list of the pros, the cons and the neutrals.Pros :+ Graphism ; Considering it has been released in 2008-2009.+ Soundtrack ; Brutal and powerful, one of the best metal and hard rock soundtrack I listened in a videogame.+ Cars ; Despite the huge load of germans cars, you can still find a great american Dodge Ram SRT 10 called the Pick-up T2. ['Murica intensifies]+ Gameplay ; Easy, fast and fluid.+ Open World ; ""Like GTA, you know ?""+ Splitscreen ; 4 players Polizei-Ausfahrt-Party. + Race gamemod ; Chaos and destruction.+ Damage physics ; Pretty decent.Neutrals :~ Based on the German TV show Alert for Cobra 11 ; I don't have a strong opinion, some will say this is a great show.~ Storyline ; ""Chef : Cobra 11, I choose you !"" ""Semir&Ben : OMG God Bless Germany !"" ""Enemies : I am having a heart attack ! *die*"".~ Voice acting ; It's really bad, I admit but you need to consider the budget they got to do this game.Cons :- Lack of clarity and ingame messages ; This game isn't for the lazy ones, you need the ability to easily figure out what's going on and what's the objectives. The less ressourful people will dislike this game.- Bad staging ; Yes, considering there's no cutscene or models for the characters, they did what they could.- Advices ; They should show the utility of the Action key in some missions. Futhermore, when you choose a place to do your patrol, check if the car you chose got a red flag next to its name. It means, you have a mission to do, and this car is allowed.TL;DR, I really appreciate this game. However, don't think this game is incredible like a Grand Theft Auto. And please, if you buy it, don't be one of those bad players making bad reviews with only 15 minutes played.→ 80/100			"

But it's not the worst. It's not your average A++ racing game. It's mechanics and graphics are okay-ish, compared to other games.I'll be honest; I had fun. A few hours was enough for me to find some things to do (here's a screenshot of me doing something. It involves me running over and gathering NPC vehicles). I also enjoyed how you could actually (kind of) destroy things.Overall, it's a good game. Has free roam, places to explore, and things to destroy. I'd probably get it when it's cheap though (or in my case, when it's free).Unexpectedly had fun, 10/10 (for realism, of course).			"

												This is definitely not the best racing game out there, but I am not going to compare a game that I paid $1 for with $60 games. For $1, I got hours of action packed, intense races and chases. I have played the story for 16 hours and I'm not even done yet. The graphics are pretty good and the handling is realistic. The dialogues are cheesy and the missions are somewhat cliche, but don't let that stop you from buying this game.			"

												This game materialized in my library one day. I never purchased it, it was just there. I installed it out of boredom and expected the game to be no better than those ""X SIMULATOR"" games you see here on Steam. I was pleasantly mistaken, because this game, despite being made on an almost non-existent budget, is surprisingly solid. What the game lacks in originality, presentation, and innovation, it makes up for with solid controls, and really great vehicle physics. There's a fair amount of attention to detail here, too. Your car, and every other car in the game as well, can be absolutely smashed into an ugly mess, with way more convincing looking damage than what GTA IV and V have to offer. You can park in front of a train, let it smash your car's front grille in, go flying, land, and not be able to control your car at all because your front wheels are now several feet away racing eachother down the autobahn without you. The gameplay is pretty generic and repetitive, but still solid. You'll get bored eventually, but until then you'll have fun chasing criminals, smashing into everything, and racing. Traffic will move the ♥♥♥♥ out of your way when you turn on your sirens, and when you finally catch up to the bad guys and P.I.T. them into a wall, you'll have to hold them still there for a few seconds in order to ""arrest"" them. There's things to collect and vehicles to unlock, including an excavator and a massive armored personnel carrier with six wheels, which absolutely smashes everything out of its way including buses and large trucks, even in oncoming traffic. All of the cars are unlicensed rip-offs of real world vehicles, which I'm glad the developers managed to do. It's not a BMW, it's a Semir! They're different! We swear!All in all, it's a solid game. It's not the best game in the world, but it's definitely not bad either. It's just decent. A 5/10, or I guess 7.5/10 if you go by IGN's rating system. If you like racing and police chase games, and don't mind games with low budgets, pick this one up on sale.The developers of this game, sadly, stopped making video games in 2014. They were very well known in Germany, but virtually nobody knows about them outside of Germany. They specialized in racing games and their games were some of the best selling games to come out of Germany. Rest in peace Synetic, and if you guys are reading this, I loved World Racing 2 on the Xbox.			"

												This game is...this game...the mechanics of the driving and all are actually pretty enjoyable, and the graphics are pretty decent too. The UI and voice acting leave a little to be desired, but I can live with that. But the missions, the missions, the missions are just unredeemably awful. If this had just been a normal racing game, I would have liked it, but the attempt at open-worldiness is half-baked at best and doesn't improve the game whatsoever. The missions are so finnicky that it's very easy to instantly end up in a position where it becomes unbeatable, and with the complete lack of checkpoints this means you're going to be doing a lot of restarting, doing the same boring stuff over and over and over again. Staying at just the right distance from another car isn't fun, at least as implemented here. And after playing this game for an hour, I didn't get into a single race, which was what I was looking for in the first place. I feel like this game has the makings of a really great low-budget Burnout, but they instead went for some police angle that just doesn't work at all, either thematically or mechanically.			"

												Picked this up in a Steam sale long gone by and really didn't give this the time of day.  After TDU2 was in the mood for more mission base driving which CTII does quite nicely.  Nice graphics engine and alot of detail in the environment make CTII a pleasure to look at and at 60FPS.  Missions are limited to what you can do with a game like this. There are multiple difficulty levels.  It's been quite sometime but the game sort of reminds me of Wreckless, the mission based racer for the Xbox.  The primary career mode encompasses the exploits of 2 of Germanys finest though there is a Case structure for replayability and picking up past the 1st stage of a multiple stage Case, a welcome feature giving that I've played too many games that make you start from scratch.  There is a race mode where you can set up parameter based race events.  These include all of the vehicles in the game including semi's which no doubt leave a path of destruction.  A great value for the price paid and a fun game.			"

												I actually really loved this game. I bought it mainly because it was on offer but I'm having no regrets over it. It's fun and enjoyable and appeals to my need to drive a police car around pointlessly on blues. The voice overs aren't great but the storyline is pretty interesting. Up until I got stuck on a mission where you need to pointlessly jump onto a building roof to get to a helicopter that is pretty much impossible, I enjoyed it. There are some bugs and some vehicles will jump around like crazy making missions all that more difficult if not impossible. But overall, I loved the game and think that I'll probably end up spending many more hours playing it.			"

Crash Time II Review - Rating: 7.8/10General ImpressionCrash Time II is a pretty nice action-racing game. Do not trust the ""Mixed"" rating, the game is actually pretty good. The graphics and the textures are pretty nice and well-designed. Considering the fact that RTL Interactive had a small budget for this game, the graphics really are a pretty positive point for this game. The atmosphere happens in a fictional German city. The city is divided into several years, where you will have to patrol or to resolve cases, in function of the game mode you have chosen. The audio is pretty nice, I like the sounds of the vehicles. The music is decent, there isn’t anything special about it. The voice acting… is pretty terrible. It has been created superficially. The gameplay is relatively an open-world style, but the missions of it… they are boring sometimes, the developers didn’t concentrate on the gameplay very much. The story is also pretty uninteresting, 2 men have to complete the tasks given by the police. Nothing very special. The user interface is well-optimized, with no bugs and a pretty nice design. For less resourceful people, this game will be a pain: the user-interface has little information about the missions, therefore you need to figure out yourself, from the dialogues and from the environment circumstances. The controls are neat. The engines are alright, I haven’t met any bugs, crashes, screen freezes or frame drops. The mechanics are pretty sophisticated, everything around moves nicely, especially your cars’ movements/breaks/crashes. Overall, Crash Time II is a pretty nice action-racing game, with nice graphics, atmosphere and mechanics, which combines crashes and explosions with high speeds, but which needs improvement on the gameplay and on the voice acting.Positive PointsPretty nice and well-designed graphics and texturesPretty nice audio and pretty nice musicRelatively fun and challenging gameplayMany missions throughout the patrols & cases available 3 difficulties availableA pretty nice designed user interface, but it lacks of a lot of useful informationOpen-World gameplay alikeSome pretty stable enginesSome pretty nice mechanicsNeutral PointsSteam achievements and trading cards would improve the gameThe free-roam feature should be available from the beginning of the gameNegative PointsThis negative point is only available for people with less spirit of orientation: if you need tips, or exact locations where to start the mission, you will have a hard time with this game. The game should have had implemented a feature which enables or disables tipsIn my opinion, there are not enough race-type missionsThe voice acting is pretty terribleThe developers tried to make a pretty nice story, however it is not that kind of a good story, it is pretty uninteresting "

												Crash Time 2 is a series of games based on the German police drama ""Alarm for Cobra 11: Autobahn Police"". There was actually several games made under the Cobra 11 brand, then came Cobra 11 Nitro. However, none of these was exported. Next version, Cobra 11: Crash Time was exported  as ""Crash Time"", and that lead to the Crash Time II, and so on. (We're now up to Crash Time V). At its heart, Crash Time is an open-world mission-based driving sim with a fictional city for you to drive around in using variety of vehicles. CT2 has a good selection of German vehicles, none with actual names and logos, but they are readily recognizable, plus a few favorite foreign cars. The graphics are actually quite good, giving the amount of detail available for the cities and buildings. Some multilevel garages can be driven to the roof and back down via the spiral ramps. the Autobahns are nice and wide with plenty of places to speed, and many cars have nitrous injection added for that extra burst of power. The mission, on the other hand, are your typical police chase (either stop the car or crash him into toally disabled), checkpoint race (reach X checkpints, stop for 1 second in each), getaway (don't let the bad guys catch you), time trial (reach the destination via specified route before time runs out). CT2, however, added ""jumping puzzles"", where you must take the ramp at certain speeds to ensure you jump correctly onto certain locations in order to do something you can't do otherwise. And sometimes you need to chain the driving and jumping together, and that is just ridiculous. For example, one of the missions was ""stop that barge from dumping waste into the canal"" How do you do it? By taking ramps and JUMPING onto the barge (without falling into the canal, of course). That requires jumping across the canel, landing on the other side, make a left, jump ANOTHER ramp, then stop right on top of the barge (without falling off). All in... 45 seconds. ARGH! The city is large enough and open enough that ""free roam"" is quite possible Indeed, you are encouraged to ""patrol"" the city for missions to advance the campaign. Though in reality you just need to respawn at the regular start spots and few times, and/or scroll around the city map (fully zoomable in 3D!) for a ""red arrow"" which means mission starting point. Handling of the cars are simplified, and are exciting without being overly difficult. The campaign missions, however, have the dubious honor of having some of the WORST English dubbing done EVER in a game. The two voice actors are either very bored or acting too hard. Though this seem to reflect the type of TV show this was based on: more of action comedy than pure action. If you can find this game cheap, it is worth a try at least. It's not NFS: Hot Pursuit, but it has its own charms.  "

												Only having played 30 minutes in the game I'd like to say , well done. Well , you're a cop and try to take down assailants with your car in a high speed chase around the city. I dont remember how i got this game , but in no effect does it justify its store price. Only buy this if you're drunk or its free.The handling is actually better than need for speed rivals . Handbraking feels solid and destroying traffic lights and civilian cars opts in a title as collateral damage and adds up in euros. The game has 2 main protagonists. What's his name and his friend. They are cops and you , propably , are the one driving. Now, i did a mission where you had to stay for 5 seconds next to a truck and your passenger cop friend ""jumps"" on board it in order to take the wheel. After doing so , my cop car still had him as a passenger throughout the completion of the task. Now , when i noticed it , after a while ... i sighed. Not in dissapointment , but as in a weird feeling you have saying "" How did the developers miss that?"" You maybe are saying, this is a cheap ♥♥♥ old game. Sure, but it has actually VOICE ACTING. Yes , it does. And, you guessed right !  It is terrible.Anyway, like I said. Purchase when drunk.			"

												A really good case of 'Don't judge a game by it's looks'. This game may look low budget and it might be but I'd have to hand it to the devs for making such a great fun little game on a low budget. I've been looking for a good mission based racing game ever since I played The Simpsons: Hit & Run (Which I loved) and this really brought me back to when I first played it. It has some great missions ranging from escaping and smashing crooks of the road to high speed autobahn races. The graphics hold up very well for it's age and the open world is of a decent size. Cars handle great and there are plenty to unlock along the way. This was such a surprise since I got this for free and has definitely got me wanting Crash Time 3 here on steam. I hope the other games find their way onto steam someday too. 7.5/10			"

												If I had to compare Crash Time I would say a cross between Flatout and GTA driving controls. The driving scheme is interesting, and the damage portion is not as accurate or as hard hitting as Flatout, but does give satisfaction when you hit a car at a solid speed and the instant replay starts playing (one of the features of the game). The voice acting isn't as bad as everyone says (it's just the pauses between the voices that are weird). The gameplay itself is not bad. The game involves a lot of running around, doing missions, knocking these guys out while protecting these guys that sort of bit. Some missions are ridiculously hard and require a lot of replays (some missions can get meticulous). What's interesting is you can flick on your emergency lights, put on hazard lights, put on your turn signals - so if you like driving by the law in GTA this may be for you.Realistically speaking though the game provides its moments of fun and overall is playable and enjoyable. As for outstanding... not so much. It seems there are opportunities where it could have been, but it missed it's glory. For a game that I bought under two bucks... I think it's about worth it.You do get a decent game at least.RATING : 6.75/10Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign C+ Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ "

												Now this isn't the best racing simulator out there, but it's a great game to play when you have nothing to do or would like to pass time. I do admit the missions can become repetitive and the voice acting is far from great but the gameplay itself isn't half bad. I wouldn't buy this game at full price as it's not worth it at £6.99 as there are better games out there for the money. But, I managed to buy this game whilst it was on a discount so I'm not too fused about the price.Overall, this games suits certain people and their taste in racing games.			"

												Crash Time 2 is a very enjoyable game. It's not without bugs, but I think the experience is certainly fun enough to warrant fighting through those.Visually, it's fantastic, and I had no framerate issues at all running with max graphics on my GTX760 (1680x1050 fullscreen). The cars have great damage models—you can literally knock the wheels off your car, and you will actually feel it. Knock off both your front wheels, and you can't steer anymore and must reset your car. I really liked that touch.The missions are fun and varied. Even if you do similar things in some missions, they tweak the mechanics enough that you never feel like it's completely monotonous. Driving the RC cars (bomb detonators) is particularly fun.The world is HUGE, and it's a lot of fun to explore. Granted, there aren't really ""side missions"", but it's fun to just drive around nonetheless. There were quite a few moments where I went off drops at max speed, and it gave me a real sense of adrenaline flying through the air (fortunately no one was around to mock me shouting, ""Woah!!"")The story is interesting enough to keep you engaged, but it won't win any awards. The same is true for the voice acting. For a racing game, it's probably slightly above par.A good selection of cars are available, and you can pick and choose the cars you use for some missions (though certain missions can only be performed with certain cars). They have completely different feels to them, but for the most part, you're going to want to stick with the faster vehicles for most missions.I paid $0.99 for the game, and I would honestly have been happy paying $5 for it. I definitely recommend it.The downsides to this game are the bugs, and here those are (with recommended workarounds if available):- On ""wreck the car"" missions, if you flip the opponent's car over, the car disappears and respawns somewhere near you (the same thing that your car would do if it got stuck upside down). If the opponent's car happens to respawn behind you, that means it will likely turn around and drive the other way. I recommend doing your best to not flip over the cars or completely pin them where they can't move. Just keep hitting them with force or get them behind you then keep bumping them as they try to pass you.- Sometimes, it's just plain hard to find a mission. You drive around for a while and nothing appears. In these cases, try switching cars (look for ones with mission indicators), and try switching starting locations. You shouldn't ever need to be driving around for more than a minute for the mission brief to play, so keep moving about until a mission appears. Annoying, but workable.- The navigation arrow is absolutely useless sometimes. It will recommend jumps over bridges when your car isn't fast enough to make the jump. Fortunately, the mini-map has a much better direction indicator that adjusts for different routes and recommends shortcuts. I highly recommend using that primarily (even though you have to look off the screen a bit).			"

Product received for free
												I don't know why...But I really enjoy the game. I like the open world, the (really) huge number of cars (and some other vehicles; e.g. a cart or a forklift), the okay graphics and damage models as well as the property damage counter of course ;)The story is okay, and even after the story you still have stuff to do as the parts of a cool vehicle are spread over the whole map to find, finding all of them will unlock it.You can pick the game up for about a buck since there was a giveaway for it; I received the Steam key for the game there, so I mark this as a product I got for free, but I actually played the game on CD-ROM before owning it on Steam - So my playtime is definitly more in reality.

												So I got this game for free some website so giving it away, was sitting in my gameslist for like 2 months so I today installed it and this game turns out it really good, but I wouldn't pay the full  price, I would only buy this on a sale. This game is sort of based on a german cop show, well it has their characters in it and them voice acting and they're the main characters in the game. So its fun, Lots of missions, 4 Hours in and I still have not finished it and I've only been doing missions. The game has weird controls but when you get used to them they're fine. Urm... Pros: Fun.Long story.Funny-ish diaglog.Cons:Non-licsened cars. pretty dispointing for a car game.Controls - Really Hard to get use to.Missions. - Because the missions work on a basist that you ethier drive to them or get them on the radio, but only certain vechiles can get them at a time, and sometimes you have to go look for the missions which the game didn't really explain.Tortuial - (Or however you spell it) Its very trickly because you mess up you have to restart a big chunck of it, same with the missions.Overall rating. 6/10 Buy Or Not Buy : Buy on sale.

												I crashed into a train at around 200MPH. Left almost no damage on my car.10/10 - Would try to commit suicide again.--But seriously, this game is not that bad. It's not a GOOD game, but it'll make you laugh! I gurantee it.The graphics for a 2009 game are actually pretty decent, the voice acting is so cheesy you'll either love it or hate it.The music and sound effects are decent. It's an overall all DECENT game.(I got it for free, so I can't really complain either.)			"

												This may be one of the best bad games I've played for awhile.  And it IS bad.  The mission design (and voice acting) appears to have been coded by brain-damaged bonobo apes.  Missing scripting is beyond awful with incredibly rigid and linear requirements that allow ZERO variation, NPC AI is absolutely terrible, enemy cars can absorb ludicrous amounts of damage and -here's the best part- whereas in ANY other GTA-style game, flipping a car on its roof will kill it...  in this game, it causes them to respawn, sometimes 100m+ away from you or on another road entirely.  If you're playing a mission where staying close is a requirement, ""pitting"" a car can literally cause an instant fail situation.However...  The graphics are pretty decent, it runs at a good framerate, the city environment is nice, the car handling is good enough, and the crash modeling is actually really damn fun.So, basically, if you can pick it up for a buck or two (or in a bundle, like I did) it's honestly good for a few hours just screwing around and making things go BOOM real good.  However, any attempt to actually p[lay the game as intended or advance through the missions is almost certain to cause incredulity, ironic laughter, or loud swearing at the brain-damaged bonobos who put this thing together.   And for the love of Bob don't pay more than a couple bucks for it.			"

Liked the characters, because as a kid i watched the TV series -  Alarm für Cobra 11 - Die Autobahnpolizei  and i liked it.Pros:  Amazing graphics especially for a 2009 game  Descent voicing  Nice concept  Cool splitscreen featureCons:  Dull driving  No cutscenes  Repetetive missions  You lose money for crashing into thingsI do not recommend this game because the controls just ruin it.

												Wow I have to say I'm impressed. I got this game for almost nothing and I expected nothing from it, and got a very pleasant  surprise. The pictures is really how the game looks, its pretty. Gta 4 should have looked like this. The missions are pretty fun: chasing, escort, stopping a vehicle, RC car bombing with a little side story to every misson. The voice actors were probably tired of got minimum wage, because there are few passionate dialoges. Too bad there isn't a campaign just series of missions with no connections to each other, and the menu system looks like an early 2000's freeware games'.I think its worth a try even if it has no tradecard (yet)			"

												This is going to be a review for 3 different potential buyers:1. The buyer, who has not played this game before and has the equipment and money to play most modern-ish gamesThis game has its good moments, but it really has nothing unique that you wouldn't find anywhere else. If you're still interested in this bad-comedy-action type racing game, may I suggest later titles from this franchise.2. The nostalgia buyerYou might be pretty tempted to buy this old 'gem', especially since its price gets pretty darn low on sales. Before you add this to your cart, let me just mention some of the issues I encountered:*I don't remember the non-Steam version having frequent framerate issues. This does. Most notably on the edges of the map, but they happen pretty much all over the place. And I don't mean drops by just a couple of frames. I'm talking about motion sickness level nosedives.*Speaking of frame rates, I averaged about 38-40 fps, with 1920x1080 resolution and all other graphics settings on the lowest possible setting. I don't know if that's a sign that this port is badly optimized or that my computer is sh*ttier than I had previously thought. For reference, I can play project cars on medium settings with the same resolution and almost never go below 60fps. Not really an issue other than I'm a bit spoilt.*You still have to grind through the bland story missions to gain access to the good cars*In my case, it didn't really provide the entertainment I thought it was going to deliver. After 10 hours you've completely depleted the game and it has nothing more to offer you. That doesn't mean I didn't have fun, but the framerate issues were the things that killed it for me.Ultimately, it's your choice..3. The buyer, who has not played this before, but can't really run or afford any better quality alternativesI think the story and voice acting are irrelevant to this type of game. Sure they are bad, but I think it was intentional. It would be worse, if they tried to make it serious and ultimately failed at that. And it's not even that annoying. Besides, you should be able to skip most dialogue. Anyway, you are realistically buying this for the action stuff, and as far as that is concerned, it is very solid. Some cars are even a joy to drive. Great for creating low budget action sequences, if that's a thing you're interested in. And when it costs under a euro, it's a steal. Would recommend.Thus ends the review			"

												A decent game for the 99p I got it for, graphics, driving mechanics and... well nothing else is good. The driving is great and is pretty near perfect, and the graphics are brilliant for a game that is so under the radar. But, everything else is bad, the voice acting, the open world attempt and the weird damage total. The damage total counts the damage you've caused to property, it doesn't work the prices are off, 24 euros for taking out a strret sign and 3000 euros for hitting a wall and doing no damage. The controls are another issue, there are no remapping options (as I can find) and playing with the arrow keys is annoying. Overall I would recommend this game but I would ssay do not get it unless it is under £2			"

												Now to start I bought this game for my brother’s account a while back, and i of course played it once and a while. So when the game was on sale for 99 cents I decided to bite the bullet and buy an old game that my brother and I used to enjoy. Now to say the least I have played allot and i mean allot of racing games and car/truck sim's that are out there, and to say this is one of my favorites is a lie. For starters the overall graphics of this game are not bad for the games time period, though graphics don’t make a game what it is. The story line; well there isn’t a story line it’s just a bunch of missions thrown together with shabby characters and some really bad voice acting. Split screen is ok if you have someone to play with other wise no online multiplayer as far as i see. The Open world aspect of the game is not bad at all, though seems like its a cross between a car sim and a burn out paradise type of racing game. The car mechanics aren’t horrible but definitely not the best. Now one thing I would have to give them is the body physics of the car, even though they are not soft body they still put allot of over racing games body physics to shame. Final verdict is if you want a game that you can waste some time in then buy it when it goes on sale otherwise I would stay away from it. 5/10			"

												After seeing some reviews (and realizing I have a racing game), I did the first mission. I may have had the settings wrong, because I hardly can see my speedometer at all. I am pretty sure that I did have it in the right resolution, but didn't enable the widescreen option. Do I want to open it up again?Hahahaha, no way. I've already buckled my seatbelt, as my directional coordinator has done as well. Did you know that he turns the same direction as you steer it? You're not getting us out of that ditch with your steering wheel mimicing, Jimmy.Going past that, it was an okay mission. But that's not where it kept me in, because I was in it for the destruction of the game. I played many roles, like ""The man who can't help but drive into objects."", or ""Road Conqueror: You are on the wrong side of the road!!!"".My personal favorite is when I drove on the train tracks trying to get away from the train. It worked for a while, until I came to a literal slab of concrete in the train tunnel. When I saw that, I wondered if they didn't want the trains to use it, and had an alternate route. Let's just say that I was very wrong as I slammed into it.I crashed pretty hard, and the cutscene thought it was funny to replay it. That feature was bogus, especially when you are on the controller. Good thing I knew about the escape key, or else I'd have to suffer listening to the intro part of the mission. (or was it the tutorial? I can't tell when I am too busy being the harbringer of destruction.)Do I intend to make this a real criticism? Not really. I can however point out if you are just wanting to look for a cheap thrill for smashing cars up, then I would somewhat suggest this title. Everything else is like it was in a low budget, which isn't in my tastes. If there is more areas to go for, then I may come back later.This is your captain, and you'll die on the previous flight.

												Guten TagWillkommen auf der Autobahn mit mir Warenzeichen. Heute werden wir auf Crash-Zeit II aussehen.Very good game over all to say the least. Well worth the $10. (Got mine for $2.50)The graphics in the game are great and the physics are great as well. The only two things I do have to complain about is the voice acting and the missions.First, take a look at all the reviews below this one and then come back to here. Well what did you see? I bet that every single review you saw complained about the voice acting and how terrible it is, that it is so funny. Am I right? Good. Another thing that I say is bad is the missions. Are they supposed to happen randomly? Are they timed? Do you have to drive to a certain area to activate them? The game tells you nothing about where to go to find missions. No waypoints, no markers, nothing.Well now that the bad is done, lets talk about the good.Amount of cars: good 10/10Features on cars ie. Police cars make noise and have working lights: good 10/10Smashing around and crashing at 230kph: excellent 12/10Missions, for what I have done so far for them: good 8/10EXPLOSIONS: good 10/10Graphics: good 7/10Sounds: good 8/10World Design: good 9/10Voice acting: NEIN 0/10Mission finding: NEIN 0/10If you can find it on sale or get a coupon (thats what I did) then buy it and just have fun crashing into trains and other cars.Tschüs			"

												This game was quite the experience, the detail put into the driving and car damage is something to brag about. Granted, you should expect the kind of detail from a game called Crash Time II. This game runs very well even on cheap computers and the graphics are pretty sick for the price you pay for it. The best part of Crash Time II is that it is a very challenging game, i had to try most of the missions four or five times before i was able to nail it. Theres not much to do but chase bad guys, do tricks, and wreck stuff, but this is still a pretty fun game. The GSA team rates Crash Time II two out of five but dont let the low rating fool you, you should get this game!			"

												The first thing that you must keep in mind if you have purchased this game ( or got for free ) is that you didn't spend a whole lot of money for it. For this, you will be Thankful ; you do get what you pay for. Don't expect a Burnout Series game level of development and gameplay. If you want a ' quality ' game, be prepared to pay the premium and scroll past Crash Time 2.The game is based on a German TV show called ' Alarm für Cobra 11 – Die Autobahnpolizei Ausfahrt ', a TV show that I cannot figure out as to whether or not is a serious crime drama or a German spoof take on the 80's series, Miami Vice. If you are from an English speaking country, the TV show that it is based on looks really really bad ( I did some youtube research by watching a couple of episodes to try and better understand what this game is based on )Graphics :  I haven't seen a PC game since that late 90's that has such a short draw distance and pop in. You can actually see the grass grow as you drive by embankments. The developers must have heard ' Bloom ' and ' HDR  ' and thought ' you mean ' Glare ' as that is what you get. Glare then translates to making the screen bright white in some areas. The plus to this level of techincal wizardry is that you don't need an i7 and a pair of Titans to play this game. The specs required to play this game are from around 2003 i.e. if you are reading this review, your computer can run the game. Yes there are some slow downs, but in general, it's not a bad frame rate for a 2003 standard driving game. Unlicensed cars which are very obviously actual BMW, Mercedes, VW's, etc. The cars are not bad at all, hence why you can actually tell what they are based on ( or not badged as ). The city is well, German ( industrial, efficient and logically laid out but a little bland  ; mostly built in the last 70 years onwards due a disagreement with a couple of countries a number of years ago ).  Graphics wise, not the worst - not the best - kinda ' Eh ' if you can forgive the HDR ( or lack of ) and pop in that is.Gameplay : Hmmm. You have a car and can drive around - really enough said. The ' handling ' is an arcade racer, not a sim. Don't expect fantastic drifts, just understeer and poor brakes. I tend to use the handbrake instead of the normal brakes for stopping. The nearest driving experience would be if CrazyTaxi had a love child with an early TOCA game. The story is as deep as a standard cup of water but hey, you either paid $0.99 or got this game for free right?Voice acting : Voice acting needs a special mention all of it's own. You need to play the game to understand where I am coming from around this. I have NEVER heard such bad voice acting from ANY game, TV show, telemarketing scammer, etc. When I first heard the characters, it was quite amusing. As the game went on, it becomes, well a little bit creepy. Ever heard a 6 year old in a school play? Well it's a bit like that but spoken by a 40 plus year old guy.  Why really bad English accents? Why not German's speaking English? I think this would have worked better ( and they could have slipped in the word Squirrel for bonus points ) .... You have been warned. Controls :  I have read some reviews on this game that say that the controls are difficult. I did not experience this problem as I plugged in my generic USB gamepad AKA PS2 copy and configured to suit a PS2 layout. You MUST use the D Pad to control the menu up and down then use the top button to select ( Triangle for PS2 ) and circle equivalent ( PS2 ) to go back. If you use the keyboard at any point on the menu, the game pad will be disabled. It's really not very hard to figure out though. To configure, enter the control lay out menu and set the control for the button of your choice ( press enter on the keyboard, then the button on the game pad that you want to use for that control ). For those that have configured a DOS / Windows 95/98 game pad, it's back to those days. Once configured, controls were responsive and worked as you want them to.Conclusion :  Reading the above you are probably wondering why I am recommending this game? The fact remains that it is a very cheap ( or Free )  FULL game with graphics that exceed homebrew games. Buy it, but don't expect Burnout Paradise for $0.99c or Free. If you want Burnout Paradise, then don't be so cheap and buy it ( or wait for a Steam Sale 75% off ).Note that support for the game was ditched after about a year from release, but likely not for the reason that Apple use to ditch support to sell you another product ( though we are upto Crash time 5 according to the interweb )			"

												I recieved this for free from a site I found on reddit. While I of course like free games, I don't often also like playing them. As far as this title goes, I don't find anything special about this game, and in my opinion it is quite... uncomplete.The graphics are decent at least, not great, but not bad either, and while they paid less attention to environment, cars are as shiny as they can be, which would make sense in a car game.However the gameplay is where it takes a turn for the worse. The only storyline I've been able to gather is that you and a friend of yours are some sort of undercover cops who use a civilian car to catch. While there is no continuos gameplay, at least you have freeroam, and you can get random missions from the dispatch.But let's see what the actual missions are about... well, chasing criminals, smashing their car until they come to a full stop. I have so many pet peeves when it comes to realism in this game that I can barely make myself write this review. Firstly, there are absolutely NO human animations. If the scenario makes your partner jump into a truck while you keep steady near it.... he just stays in the car, even though supposedly he is driving a truck now, even though he is still riding shotgun with you. Turning the wheel? No animation. Crashing recklessly in everything? No animations. The evil guy whos car you just totaled with nothing left other than the wireframe? No animation. What's more, you don't even arrest him. You just wreck his car (which takes a ridiculous ammount of bumping into) and then.. leave. And I guess he will just sit patiently idling (not like he has animations to begin with) in his carwreck until your fellow police officers arrive.About the sound, not great either. The radio consists in a few metal instrumentals, which I can't say I dislike, but that's about it. No radio control, you always listen to the same tracks over. However that shouldn't be bugging you more than the total lack of talent in voiceacting. I'm not trying to bash the developer here. I didn't do my research, might as well be some guys in a basement, struggling to make their dream game but still... the voice acting is terrible. TERRIBLE.All this being said, if you get the game from free from some random humblebudle-esque deal on the internet, go ahead and at least waste some time with this, however I would never recommend anyone actually paying money for.

												Based on a long running german TV-series about two highway police officers, I cant say I ever watched the show but I'd say it is very loosely based on it.Now, we all know games about movies tend to be usually bad, so what about a game about a TV-show? If your first thought was it must be worse than you'd be right.In case you are a fan of police stories or racing then you should probably take a step away from this. If you just wanna crash into things and kill about 10 or 15 minutes while you wait for a better game to download then you might as well.The cars and the damage models are the only thing remotely fun. As the damage model isnt only affecting your car visually but also your performance, the things they expect you to do, either will be fun or just frustrating.Limiting the amount of damage your car can sustain or how much property damage you do are mission objectives that just utterly ruin it.You'd think that it makes sense seeing how they are police officers but no, thats not the case in a lot of them. For instance: A girl gets kidnapped but as soon as your car takes more than 15% of damage the mission fails. Too bad girl, have fun with your kidnapper.The awful mission design, horrendous voice acting and repetetive music is what will ultimately make this unenjoyable.			"

												Bought this game on sale: 2,49€The missions are not only difficult but somewhat lack fun and precise gameplay.Sometimes you dont actually know what to do in certain missions or find out too late and see the game over screen far too soon. I had like 2 seconds already in the first mission and if you fail a target you have to start the process all over again.The graphics are ok keeping in mind that the game is made in 2009. The open world is not very big but very alive. There are trains, helicopters ect adding a lot life to the game. There are also many different vehicles. Traffic AI could be improved by far. There are some bugs in game like when cars cross the andreas cross they jump or easily have an accident which should have been fixed with a patch long ago and shows lack of support from developers. German voices are horrible and a joke, dialogs neither useful nor funny except some of the sarcastic advertisment which is seen on buildings or truck cargo containers. The music depends on your taste and can be switched off. Cars have some features like the horn, turn on alarm, blink etc. This game is not intended to be a driving simulator and therefor the physics of the vehicles are acceptable. I however cannot recommend the game for an average price of like 10 € since main gameplay is awfull. Either try Crash Time 3 or buy another open world game like sleeping dogs, watch dogs or GTA 4 or 5 or Driver San Francisco which are a bit more expensive but add much more fun in gameplay, better graphics, better voiceacting, bigger worlds and better music. The game seems to be a mix of Bournout and Need for Speed but you rather get those titles for like 10 bugs.The game also has no steam achievements to offer. 2,49€ is not a waste of money if you wanna try it out. I am fine with the purchase but i am also happy i didnt pay more. I watched some youtube videos and saw enough screens to be prepared what i can expect.			"

For me it looks pretty realistic, even though it is an old game.Bad things about this game are voice acting and boredom, cause as I already mentioned there is not many things to do you can only cheese cars and play races.

												I obtained it for free via a giveaway, and as soon as I launched it, it had tha bad-simulator-feeling. Which, in some way, is. The menu interface, the music, even the fonts used are screaming ""german simulator"". I believe that the developers thought to retouch an unfinished simulator and make it something more like a ""racing"" arcade game. What do we have as a result? A bad polished low budget Burnout style racer, full of simulator elements that are entirely useless (it has dedicated buttons for indicator lights for example). It has one of the worst AI I've seen for a while in a racer, there is no indication to what is the main campaign or the single missions, you just randomly pick a mission and hope you will proceed afterwards. And -oh my god- the voice acting is so fricking bad, it's hilarious.PROS:decent graphicsresponsive controlsCONS:everything elseVerdict:4/10This game is so bad, it's actually funny..

												Very nice looking cars, levels are very basic, menu system is very poor.  options menu is just ridiculous, no button config. the tutorial doesnt even tell you what the buttons are that you need to use, it just tells you to do something and expects you to know. if it was better made could be a nice game!

												You know, I am going to have to complain, what a surprise that is huh? Okay so what do we have here... The graphics are something I can deal with because we all know that graphics doesn't make a game, However it does improve the quality of a game quite well and my pc could run this at super omega ultra high quality, the graphics on high could still use some work however. With saying that, it could definitely be improved upon. My 2nd complaint has to come from the voice acting, ABSOLUTELY terrible. It literally sounds like you hired people just randomly off the street that had NO experience at all with any form of voice acting before this, I mean for all I know you could have picked up some bums off the street and told them you'd buy them a bottle of booze if they read words off a paper, because quite frankly that's what it sounds like to me. My 3rd complaint has to come from the spawn. I crashed on the road and I pressed R which is the respawn button in this game by the way, anyways... I was NO WHERE NEAR, the river and for some reason, your coding sucks so badly that giving me a spawn in the river was a good idea, but it wasn't only that! I pressed R again, ONLY TO BE SPAWNED IN THE RIVER AGAIN, you want to guess what I did next? I pressed R and what happened? Respawned in the water again and again and again making this game even more unplayable and unacceptable than it already is to begin with. It can't be that hard to make actual spawns that are decent that are not in the middle of the water scuba diving. Let's be honest here that's ♥♥♥♥ programming. Another problem I have seen in this game is some of the missions seem very... Mediocre and even that is being polite and being nice. I had more fun doing bugger all in this game than I did doing the actual 'story line' which barely exists in this game to say the least. Now this isn't the worst and I realize that but (Who expected it to be in the first place I mean let's be honest here.) That doesn't give you the excuse to release something so appallingly broken that it's rendered unplayable because the developers are either trolls or rookies when it comes to creating codes in a game that make it an enjoyable experience. At least this game doesn't seem to be running on Lemonade stand funds like some games so I'll give it that... (*Cough* most simulators that are on steam.) Also this game lacks mouse functions for whatever reason so you use your arrows for menus and we all know we're too lazy for that. Takes more time then using the mouse and that's boring. There's absolutely no reason why you couldn't add in a mouse mechanic, no reason whatsoever. With all these complaints I cannot give you a recommendation. There's no way, especially when there comes a time when you have to look out for your fellow steam users and help them before they bite the bullet and waste their precious time and money on a pathetic excuse of a game like this. Do I recommend this game to friends and other steam users? Not on your life, there's no chance in hell that I could do that. Do NOT buy this game you WILL be disappointed. The game seems like it goes nowhere just like this review, just filling up characters in a box telling you how unbelievably bad a game is.(Originally Released Aug 27, 2009 but seems like it's from the 1980's but with better graphics for a game back then. In other words it's ♥♥♥♥.)12/10 DO NOT BUY.Thank me later. Penguin out.			"

												The game looks very good visually and there's lots of fun bits here and there (example, exploding cows). That aside, the tutorial does not help you figure out how to play the game in the slightest. It teaches you simple things like, ""How to tail a car,"" and such. But it doesn't really help otherwise. I kinda gave up on the tutorial after the second part since the car I was driving didn't have good handling and I ended up destroying the front wheels to the point that I couldn't drive it anymore. There's also no area where you can see the controls. If there is then I'll correct that part, but as far as I looked I couldn't find any control mapping. Overall, the game can be very fun. I just had a very difficult time figuring out the controls which turned me off instantly. Most games have been very intuitive about teaching players their controls (even back in the day when controls were simple and easily understood on systems like the SNES). This does not teach you how to use your controller/keyboard. Just kinda figure it out on your own and hope you don't press some ""self-destruct"" button (note, there is no self-destruct button as far as I know) accidentally.			"

												I played this game long time ago,as far as I remember it was a bonus to some magazine for gamers, and that I uninstalled it really fast. Long time later it was included in some bundle,I totally forgot about it and tried it out now. The game is not horrible,but I also wouldn't call it good.The game is based on a german series about policemen called Alarm für Cobra 11 and was made clearly for the fans of it. The driving mechanics aren't bad,so it's playable,but after a while it gets boring like hell. Despite not being a total crap,I wouldn't recommend you to buy it,especially not for the full price.5/10 would not crash my time again			"

												I got this game when it was on sale at just .99$ so i decided to pick it up just cause, assuming it wouldn't be great based on the major price reduction. To my delight I was wrong, the game is a blast to play. The graphics of the cars before and after they get smashed are great and so is the map. The map is fairly big, with lots of jumps and small race courses spread throughout the map. The game was originally made in Russian so the voice acting is a little rough, but does not take away from the overall game, and I honestly enjoy it, it's comically bad.There are only a few bad things in my own opinion when it comes to this game. When other cars explode, the explosions are weak, they don't look real at all. Also when you just want to explore the map it asks you if you want to do the missions to often making you stop for a bit to say refuse mission. Also when I started playing the game I didn't enjoynot being able to use the mouse, but it's easy to get used to.Positive-Large map-Many types of cars-Interacctable terrain (I.E. Trains, Cars, Cows etc...)-Realistic physics-Lots of fun missions-Wonderful graphics-Cars have great damage graphics-Lots of cars to smash-Tons of breakable items to drive through-Fun jumps scattered around the map-Replay after big smashesNegatives-Unrealistic explosions-Comically bad voice actingOverall a great game for the .99$ I got it for but honestly I believe it's worth the 10$ as well.9.5/10			"

												Where can i start with this game?Well first off i got it for free so atleast im not annoyed that I payed the steep price of £6.99.Secondly, Imagine everything you know and love about driving games like stuntman (which IMO this is a poor copy of), now forget it all. The game handles very poorly, from not being able to ue the analog stick in menus to the the car being sluggish to turn one second, to spinning 360 the next.Continuing with controles, they are so random its not even amusing, (Y) is horn, (X) is siren (on, on silent, off), the right analog stick only has left and right in use and thats only for the respective indicators (im not even joking) and as far as i can tell, the bumpers do nothing at all (atleast in the tutorial anyway).Interface wise the game is also quite poor, your speedo, map, mission objective and distance to target are all in seperate parts of the screen so you find yourself looking around at everything but the road. The speedo also has this odd feature of telling you what speed you need to hit ramps at, it will do this by taking up 1/4 of your screen and having a huge green mark and arrow at the speed you need to be, this speed is NOT optional, too slow you fall into a gap/dont make the jump, too fast and the game will send you flying into anything that it feels could be in your way.There is also a replay cam that will replay what you did not 2 seconds ago (that seems about the extent og its record time) whenever it feels you've done something special, this is considered anything from a high speed overtake to a 45 degree turn, a 1080 aileron roll over a building or a 360 backflip over a roundabout? nah thats not replay worth (oh and your leads can get away while the replay is heppening).Gameplay. The random spawn for cars is so borked that I swear i saw a family car with a caravon on it pull out of an industrial complex, and this wasnt a one off mistake, about 30 cars where queing to get out of a police testing area. The waypoints are another thing that are non-optional, miss one by a smidge and you will find yourself doing a 180 or slamming it into reverse while your lead gets away. Lastly that brings me to the persuit mechanics, it told me to attempt to stop the van with some light taps, instead I got infron of it and forced it to stop. Not good enough. Ok its traiing i can forgive that, so 5 taps it is, then I have to dissable the vehicle, so I flip it on its side with some fancy driving, nope, didnt fill the damage indicator so it de and respawns to carry on.Overall this game was very poor, it looked ok back in 2010 when it was made im sure, but now its dated, jaded and needs to fade into the background.~Round Up~Story - unrated, I refused to play after the tutorial.Graphics - 7 - There not the worst and I'm sure when it was released they did look good.sound - 5 - forgetable OST with less than average voice acting topped with a siren that is all you can hear when its on. The only reason I didn't rate lower is becasue the crash sounds arn't that bad.Gameplay - 3 - Poor controles with a bad HUD and strange mechanics.Overall - 4 - It might have a good story and if your into games like stuntman you could get on with it but it just seems like a copy done wrong, if you like stuntman, break out the PS2 and play it, you'll have alot more fun, trust me. £6.99? I'd  still be anoyed if I'd paid £2.			"

												Terrible game. The controls are never explained to you, nor appear to be configurable. The launch options are something I'd expect out of a 20th century game, and the voice acting and dialogue is terrible. On top of that, it is far too easy to be thrown out of the map by crashing, which appears to be a common thing. I gave up after I got stuck, tried to respawn, and kept respawning under the map.			"

Guess what,after u fail to stay away from the vehicle that u are escorting,u have to listen to 1min and a half of dull conversations,which sounds like reading from a piece of paper.And when attackers attack,ur fellow cop cars just expolde when u see no rocket or bullet flying around.And only when ur partner radioed that suspects are armed that u knew what hit them! lol When the instruction shows:STOP OPPONENT! ok,i'm stupid enough to try to ram it into the fence and get the car stuck to STOP it,his car just disappear and RESET the way when u press R,then it respawn and lleave u with the stupid fence (no offense,fence)! okay,if thats not the issue,there are chances that when it or u stuck even on his own and he reset,its FREAKING 467m away,leaving me staring at the countdown of 7s after which I fail the misssion.Moreover,there is a time when i finished the former objective and found my next target to STOP/Ram 250m stuck behind me,crap,and i failed by not having him kept up.And i still keep playing till the 3rd mission,in the 2nd mission(A day off),they chose to race over who gets the day off cause they are not allowed to both get it.C'mon,aint u police or something?

The cars just feel...wrong (for lack of a better word), The voice acting is horrendous, The missions are kind of meh, But at least the graphics are nice. Just get a Burnout game or Crash Time 3, They may not be the best, But they're better than this mess.			"

												   This game reminds me in some way hybrid of Midtown Madness and Burnout Paradise City. Good game about cars with elements of open world made by the small, unknown studio. Crash Time 2 has good optimization, interesting physics and damage system; missions bring some variety to gameplay. In game you will not meet any pedestrians, but instead you can squish cows, all of them.   So, if you like such sort of games - buy it, if discount will be [/b] 60% [/b] or higher.			"

The AI car would keep getting stuck on things then telaporting away so it was free, at it was alwas telaported to the wrong dirrecting or even over walls makeing it very hard to follow/take down the AI car...

												DO NOT PAY FOR THIS GAME!!! I was lucky enough to pick up this hunk of junk on a free give away, and I am so glad I didn't actually pay for it. Firstly, any type of car game that you have to attempt to maintain speed on a keyboard is going to suck from the beginning...Then you have friendly AI that will swerve randomly even if you are beside them sending you veering into the side rails...If that's not enough, it seems your car is made of paper in comparison to enemy vehicles, ie. sharing a side by side front on collision with a train at the same speed only to watch the enemy in my 'totalled' screen drive off visibly unharmed...I'm sure there's plenty more wrong, and possibly some good things, but the first mission was enough for me to move to my next game...

Each time the counter reached 0.8 seconds, and the van moved away, failing my attempt and resetting the timer.Tried everything from forcing the van to a wall to just handbreaking in front of it.Since it can just back up or speed away, nothing worked (Even if it moves by an inch, timer resets)Got sick of it, and trashed the van. Tutorial failed, because objective was capture and not destroy.Uninstalled, never looked back.10/10 would fail tutorial because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay anytime again.			"

												Crash Time 2 Review - Raymond KTPlayable but not as exciting as I expected. It's frustrating to stop a target that it suddenly teleports away and keeps running. There's a bit of a story but the voice acting is lame and the dialogs candid. Do not waste time on this game, very poorly done. Voice acting in game is terrible; the events are very poorly scripted and has a lot of bugs. I had problems using my Xbox 360 gamepad, which i never had playing pc games. I just started playing this game and I want to like it. They graphics are great, the controls are responsive, the collisions are fun but there is just so much feeling wrong with it. Not sure how you even play it. Do you just drive around waiting for a mission to pop up? Does it matter which car you choose or what location you select? Where are these hidden items that they talk about? What do they even look like? Too many questions without answers anywhere			"

												Ok, I'm just going to state things what I like about this game and what I don't like about it.Graphically, it looks nice. But don't judge a book by its cover because the story in this game is meh. There are no real story in this game. It's just like a Cop 'Simulator'. You just freeroam and sometimes you get random missions and sometimes you need to go to the actual mission. If this game were going to be a single player type of game it better has a good story. Come on, seriously. The only thing good here is just gameplay and that's just it. You just drive around as a cop and about 10 minutes later you will get bored. The price that I'm willing to pay for this game is $3.My rating : 4/10                   I find it easy to get boredIf I were going to buy single player games I would like it to have a nice story, gameplay and game mechanics.But if I were going to buy multiplayer games I would like it to have a nice community, gameplay, game mechanics and a story(if possible).But sometimes, I just like a game where you just get in a match and just start killing.Here are the Pros and Cons.Pros:Decent GameplayGood GraphicsController SupportOpen WorldSplitscreen SupportCons:A little bit of storyBad voice actingMeh game mechanicsNo cutscenesSmall worldNo online multiplayer "

												Ok.... Let me be frank. This game is really bad. REALLY, bad. The voice acting is, bad. Very, bad. I know I said bad a lot, but bad is all I can get out of this game. Its like a nightmare you never want to be in. The game is so boring I cant use good words like ""terrible"" or ""awful"", because they just dont fit this game. This game is so bad, it doesn't need those fine words. It just needs the basic word ""bad"". So dont spend all your well earned cash on this game like I did. Dont be me, because this game is bad. So, overall...     ...7/10. Thanks for reading.			"

												You can't really complain about the game for the price it is, or at least was, when I bought it.It's a pretty crappy game overall but has some good features, such as the driving, generally I don't like car games but this has got to be one of the best car games I've played where the car responds straight away, without the annoying delay and inverted controls.Anyways, the actual missions suck balls and so does the rest of the game.Buy it with leftover steam credit or don't buy it at all.

CARS ARE GOOD WITH AROUND 8 MODLES AND AROUND 3 OR 4 VARIATIONS AND THE GAMEPLAY IS GOOD, VERY LITTLE LAG, GOOD GRAPHICS (ITS A 2008 360 GAME REMEMBER) VERY GOOD DESTRUCTION AND QUITE A FEW EXPLOSION AND THE ODD GOOD MISSION LIKE A GRAND PRIX RACE AND CHASING DOWN SUSPECTS. 6/10.

												This is a game I would recommend to people who like cars in general. Its gameplay is not realistic but not as unrealistic and ridiculous as you'd expect. You play a cop in the autobahn which is quite fun and creative in my opinion. It certainly does not stack up to something like a Need For Speed game but it's not really meant to compete with games like that.Overall- 6.5/10			"

												The game is fine.The story isn't.I've played the free roam that others enjoyed and there was absolutely nothing to do within it.. except, drive around.If you can role play doing that, then this game might be fore you.The missions are pretty hard. Mostly because, the Ai you are supposed to stop, they can restart their vehicle and face another direction and drive off while you are in an odd direction. Playing on hard after this happens, you might as well redo the mission. Then, many other missions is usually a long drive to another and another location and finally get to one spot. But your vehicle is pointing in the direction you drove in to the checkpoint, the new mission starts and shows you the direction you need to go, but that's a wall. Now you're too far away (just 1-2 seconds after starting this) now you have to start all over from the beginning.I gave up at that point. It's not something I can enjoy.			"

												I have over 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews #34 - Crash Time IISo the Oxford dictionary added janky to their list of words this year.janky (adj.): of extremely poor or unreliable quality.And it just so happens that janky sums up Crash Time 2 very nicely.I start, like with many games, by trying out the Tutorial.  So I'm start with a mission where I have to pursuit and stop a car.  Okay, sound simple enough.  In fact, I very quickly pin the car against a fence, and render it completely immobile.  Oh wait, apparently the game didn't expect me to do that so soon, so instead of giving me credit for stopping the car, it disappears and then respawns.  Now I have to chase it down again.Eventually I chase it down and this time I look long enough that the game rewarded me for it.  In the next part of the tutorial,  I have to chase the car again, except this time I have to ram it to do enough damage to stop it.  So I start ramming the car, and eventually I make the car flip over.  Awesome, I win, right?  Oh wait, no, instead of getting credit for stopping the car, the game just makes the car respawn.  Apparently it wants me to keep ramming the car.  Apparently this game equates thinking outside the box with cheating.So after ramming my way to victory, next I'm on a mission where it tells me to hit the ""Action Button"" to launch a remote control drone.  It doesn't tell me which button on the controller that is, it just says ""Action Button"" like it's obvious.  I proceeded to mash every single button my controller and none of them worked.  Oh wait, I forgot to push down on my thumbsticks.  There we go, the action button was apparently mapped to pushing down on the right thumbstick.  Totally my first choice for an ""action button"", and not those pesky X or A buttons.  So now that I've figured out how to hit the action button, it spawns what looks like a stick of dynamite on wheels.  Now I'm controlling a remote control drone.  I then drive it to my target and hit the ""Action Button"" again and blow it up.  Now I'm back in my car and it wants me to launch another drone.  Okay, so now as I am driving this other drone I have to hit this jump just right, and it will launch me over a fence to my target.  Well I wasn't going fast enough so I end up vertical against the fence.  Now I can't get myself off the fence.  I hit a bunch of different buttons, trying to get back into my car instead of the drone.  I hit the back button and sure enough I'm back in my car.  Except I didn't go back to my car, the game teleported the car to me.  So now I'm in my car stuck vertically on the fence.  I do eventually get through tutorial and decide to try and actual game.  So I pick the option to Patrol and get a mission where I have to go to the harbor to escort a car that's being delivered.  So I start by driving towards the harbor as directed.  But then as I get part way towards the harbor, suddenly my screen is black, well most of my screen anyway.  The UI is there, including my speedometer and minimap, but there's no longer a road.  Apparently I'm supposed to drive to the harbor blindfolded.


Driving to the harbor blindfolded 
A Screenshot of Crash Time II
By: EvilSpaniard




I restart the mission and this time it lets me make it to the harbor without blindfolding me.  So now I'm escorting this truck.  The truck has the prototype car in it, and in turn 2 cop cars are escorting the truck.  So I have to follow the truck from behind, but not too close, and not too far either.  I guess I'm like the undercover backup that no one is supposed to know about.  So I follow the truck for a little ways and 2 vans drive up and start taking out the cop cars.  I better help those poor cops, so I floor it to catch up.  Oh wait, that would be common sense.  I forget this game doesn't reward me for common sense because I'm breaking the rules, because now I'm too close to the truck.  Nevermind the mortal danger here, I'm outpacing the games scripting, and we can't have that.I can just picture this conversation where the publisher warns the developers of this game, ""Hey guys, the game is coming along, but it could really use some polish"".  Except the developers misunderstood and made all of the cars in the game shiny.   Unfortunately, no amount of shine could possibly cover over this janky turd of a game. "

What a sh*t pile of a game.

To be honest, the graphics and gameplay are better than Grand Theft Auto 4, then again, what driving game isn't? Thanks to console losers we get ports all the time much like this garbage.
No mouse, only keyboard control driving. I can deal with that though.

The missions just suck, when you out-drive the stupid narrator you have to drive all the way back and re-do the jump so the ""checkpoint"" catches you.

What a f*cking stupid game.

												Crash Time 2 has easily got to be one of the worst games I have ever played in my life. To be honest, I wouldn't even consider it a game, it is completley broken. The budget for the game must of been $10 because the game mechanics, and voice acting are complete s***, and the objective is non-existent. It's like no effort was put into creating this product. Games like these, make Steam look bad, so Valve, please do the Steam community a favor and remove it and other broken games off steam. Thank you.0/10			"

The physics I'd say are pretty mediocre and not appeasing to my taste. The game was utterly boring. The controls were descent but the gameplay and the mission were terrible. It wasn't challenging at all and was rather tedious. The campaign/story mode for this didn't pull me in but the graphics were half descent. The replay value would not entice me to continue playing this game. I would not recommend this game. 3/10 "

												This feels like it could have been a much better game if the voice actors and mission designers had just been given a few high grade stimulants. The game is frankly, dull and flat like an cop drama that gets cancelled 2 episodes in.  You can play it for a while, but it really can't make you care enough to finish it. It's similar to the kind of show that you'd only watch if it were 3am and the only alternative was to be in a quiet room alone with nothing but the memory of regrets you've accumulated in a life mispent. While the physics and crashing are mildly interesting, the cars get damaged really badly really quickly, and leave you having to finish a mission on 3 wheels. While some people might relish this kind of challenge, I didn't. And there is a lot of ""put your car right here for 2 minutes at speed"" challenges which seem needlessly picky about car position. It's cheap, and will kill time as long as you care to play it, but it's just not engaging. Save up and play something more interesting.			"

												I see why this game was given away for free. God awful graphics and highly sub-standard gameplay. If you love blurry textures you will love this game. It controls just like the massively overrated game Crazy Taxi, which means no real braking system and you constantly careen into things. You get two brake buttons and neither of them slow you down enough to take a corner at even medium speed without just not being able to turn enough and slamming into a wall. I could not drift around a corner because I don't think it exists in this game. Even when I slowed down some, I still could not brake enough to get around the corner without going off the road. Just a really generic Sega Arcade game ripoff that sucks big time, mainly because you could take about ten seconds to find a far superior racing game anywhere. I played through the tutorial and that was enough for me to go right back to two other far superior games, Insane 2 and one of the best racing games ever, GRID 2.			"

												This game is quite boring, its got possibly the worst voice acting/narating i have ever heard, it sounds like a british computer reading each work individually and not reacting or showing emotion to anything around them, the criminal cases are boring and repetitive and lack any kind of story e.g criminals are using karts to steal by driving them in alley ways and small places cars cant reach so race against them and take them down but guess what there are no alley ways or small places they just drive on the same old road as every other mission. Basic idea of missions is to either ram into something until it dead or go to some check point, no story, no cool car customization, no cool new map area nothing just same old cutscene of computer talking followed by driving. Other problems with this game include poor map design e.g went to drive through dark tunnel where other cars were driving, turned out the ""darkness"" was in fact a solid cube blocking you from using the tunnel and completely destroyed my car, To many cases at once, so basically there are a set of cases for which you can complete and unlock new cases unfortunatly you have to enter free roam mode and wander around until someone goes hey your near a case and automatically starts you in it and since they have such weak storylines you end up completeing multiple storylines at once and they end up making no sense but luckily the gameplay is so repetive you easily complete them all.Pros:GraphicsDriving ControlsCons:RepetitivePoor Map DesignLack of unique vehiclesLack of storylineBad voice acting/NarationBuggyAnnoying Cutscenes that can rarely be skippedBad damage reactions/Animation e.g hit wall both front wheels fly across the map, AI hits wall, small dent apears on their door.

												I'd like to give this game a shot but I can't. I've tried on and off for awhile now to try and get this game working, but it continues to crash on start up. I've followed all the guides I could find but to no avail, including re-downloading and installing several times, I never bothered with launching a thread in Dicussion considering I've scoured the Community Hub and found tonnes of threads with my same issue not being answered or being answered with fixes that have done nothing.This review is in part, my last ditch effort to get some attention drawn to my issue but primarily as a warning.

												This game is really not that bad, however $9.99 is in my opinion pushing the price. also, dont buy the game expecting a story. and for those saying its to hard because if a suspect gets more then 200+ meters away you lose, there is a nitro system, using the left shift. the handeling in the game feels pretty good. also, there are a variety of vehicles to chose from, such as APCs, 18 wheelers, and even a fork lift, as well as your typical vehicles, like coupes sedans and vans. trust me, you could do worse.

												So my time played is as high as it will ever be for this game. I decided to give the tutorial a spin...I stopped after a few minutes, these are my 7 minute observations.- Waypoints that you have a 5ft radius to drive though.- Some massive speedometer that covers your screen before jumps, - Some wierd old guy narrating and saying ""the game"" when he is talking to the in-game characters.- Great graphics- A bullet train hit me and I spun a few times and just kept driving along with the same damage I got when I smashed into another car, also I hit a wall to see what kind of damage would happen, my front wheels popped off and I kept driving while only going straight.- Some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a drum set and a guitar doing the background music, with titles like ""gazoline"" and ""twin tank""...its terrible.- Crash cams are unpredicatable and interrupt you 2-3 seconds AFTER the jump ended, with no warning.- You can crash into and destroy a lot of things that I saw, EXCEPT for the little tiny metal railings set up all over the place for you to just run into and get trapped in/on.I payed $0.99 for this game, not worth it. I feel bad for the 3d modelers in this game, they did a great job.			"

There is a special place reserved in hell for the developer and/or programmer that though this was an acceptable level of gaming, the voice acting sounds like they got the office cleaner in to do it and is plain laughable, collision detection is vague.

I turned off damage durring a race and after crashing my car started to pull then I crashed into more things because I can't steer so I pulled more, I kept pulling to different directions. I lost a damn wheel. And in the first single player mission it told me to escort a truck that was just bouncing around rather than rolling. If I got withing 40 feet of it I got a really short time to get away. If I got to far I got an even shorter timer to get back to it. The AI on my team just exploded if a butterfly landed on them.

Try playing an actual senario and you can't too close to the action (or too far away).  It's fun the kind of way being a Hollywood stunt man is .. do it right and someone else thinks Brad Pitt just did something cool while you get three seconds of screen time for several days work.

												I'd like to give this game a shot but I can't. I've tried on and off for awhile now to try and get this game working, but it continues to crash on start up. I've followed all the guides I could find but to no avail, including re-downloading and installing several times, I never bothered with launching a thread in Dicussion considering I've scoured the Community Hub and found tonnes of threads with my same issue not being answered or being answered with fixes that have done nothing.This review is in part, my last ditch effort to get some attention drawn to my issue but primarily as a warning. It seems quite a few people can play this game just fine, but I'm not one of them.			"

												This game is pretty fun. Yes I know the story is bad, and the voice acting is also not that great (Putting it on German is a bit better, and it also makes the game a bit more realistic, since the game is German), but the game is still fun to mess around in. Some missions are way too hard. For example the bank heist. The vehicle takes forever to get destroyed.  It is just not possible to do in 5 minutes (easy level). If you like to mess around a bit, buy this game on a sale. Don't pay the full price. btw I can recommend you Crash Time 4. I loved that game. Too bad it's not on Steam.			"

												55/100TL;DR. Fun car racing game. Good environment, lots of destructable items, relatively large open-world map. Poor voice acting but story is ok. Many missions seem impossibley hard. Totally not worth 10$. Try to buy it on sale (I got it for $2 I think). Good for at least a few hours of free roaming destruction and some missions.Pros:+ Driving mechanics - while not entirely realistic, they are more than adequate and feel appropiate for this game style.+ Collisions - very satisifying to just plow through some poor soul who did not pull over fast enough.+ Soundtrack - I liked it at least, the rock/metal soundtrack. felt appropiate for the fast-paced chase style racing.+ Open World - Very large with a pretty good environment. On high, the graphics are not terrible (its actually pretty close to the steam screenshots above).+ Destructable Items - pretty much solely streetside items, there is more than enough stuff to run into and cause mayhem. Always a plus.Cons:- Voice Acting - Beyond miserable. Its sooooooo cliche and often in proper grammer that no common person (let alone cop) would talk like. I know they are on a budget, but still. Come on.- Cutscenes - Not too bad, but they get annoying when you have to watch them like 8 times over (you cant skip through them).-  Motion Blur - Really annoying and I can't seem to turn it off. Sort of makes it lag too....and the biggest one of them all- MISSIONS - Even on easy, some of them seem impossibly hard. Many require you to chase some sort of perp and stop his car. Fair enough, but ""stopping"" them is defined as inflicting 100% damage on their car. Merely getting them to spin out and pinning them or flipping them isnt enough - the enemy will just respawn a few dozen meters behind you and go the opposite way. Compounding this is that there is often a limit to how far they can be from you before you fail the mission. It is super easy to spin out or miss a turn and be done. The AI takes impossibly tight turns very fast and utilizes unexpected shortcuts that you dont see until you miss them. One could easily spend 10-15 min chasing down a guy until he is at 100% damage, but we can't. There's also a timer too.Overall chance of mission success on easy? Hahahaha.Normal/Hard? Don't want to even think about it.**** EDIT: ****It should be said that not all of the missions are like this. There are some that are actually quite fun and require skill to do right - but just enough to make it a little dificult but doable. These are the ones that really make the game and the reason my score isn't worse than it is.			"

												I tried to like it, I really did, but it just doesn't compare to anything recent. In free roam I had a hard time finding the missions in the first place, and once I did, the difficulty seemed to vary between silly easy and stupid hard, even in the earlier missions.

												I don't normally review games unless I wanna give my two cents but this game? I have to, it's mixed review rate just isn't right. That being said, let's actually review this game and the whole one hour I put into it.I know one hour doesn't seem like much but to me it was enough to review most of this game.This game is like a weird mix of Burnout and GTA without being able to get out of your vehicles, it's a lot like Starsky and Hutch for the PS2 minus the guns, that game was a blast with a steering wheel and light gun. c:I bought this game for $0.99 and just recently saw it was a giveaway by Bundle Stars so I put it on my family account as well so my family could play it and it also reminded me that I should give it a try and I did.The actual review: Pros:+Semi-realistic vehicle handling and physics.+Ability to use warning indicators and turn signals as well as your siren and lights and silent police lights(No siren.).+Decent damage system.+You can pretty much destroy everything on a city wide rampage in the semi with a trailer.+Cheesy voice acting.+Great looking for being 6-7 years old.+Tons of video options and resolutions.+Great input support, works with all my gamepads and of course an X360 pad and I believe it has steering wheel support.+Stable, never crashed on me once and it runs great.+Splitscreen racing.+Manual and Automatic settings, gear shifting and more.+Fun to slam AI around during missions that warrant it.Cons:-Sometimes terrible AI and the AI spawn system is completely borked, AI will spawn miles away from you sometimes in a mission where you have to be within a few metres of them and thus causes you to fail and must restart the mission from the beginning, there are no checkpoints but most missions are pretty short. So try not to flip AI vehicles as a sort of fix.-Cheesy voice acting, not completely a negative, it's sometimes pretty hilarious listening to the voice actors putting on fake accents and faking feeling and integrity in their lines.-Not much depth to the game or story, but this game isn't really about story as it is gameplay.-Some AI is incredibly difficult to take down and may take up to twenty minutes to take down a single car smaller and slower than your vehicle which is kind of realistic but also kind of annoying if you just want to be done with the mission.-No online multiplayer and no splitscreen/online free roam/co-op.Overall, my final verdict would be 7/10, the game has bad voice acting and poopy AI at times but the game is still rather fun especially to go on a rampage and destroy anything and everything. This game has been so far extremely solid for me, no FPS drops, no crashing and everything is maxed on my system while maintaining at least 60FPS at all times.My suggestion: Wait until this game is like $3 or cheaper to purchase. It's mostly just one of those fun games to go back to and basically drive around destroying everything, taking out bad guys or leisurely strolling around and going with the flow of traffic and following road signs, etc.			"

												The only reason I have this game is because it was for free. This game can offer you some fun for 1 hour, maybe 2. The open world is amusing for a while but just crashing people get bored adter the fifth time. Beside the open world there are some mission you can play, but trust me, you don't want to do them. You can repeat the same mission 10 times because the car you are chasing has just teleported away from you and you can't keep up. In conclusion, if it is still free on Bundle stars get it, but if the deal is over do yourself a favor and do something valuable with this 10$.			"

												A very fun game and also they have good graphics especially on ground and cars texture. but they have to fix where, for example if you fail a mission you must restart from the start instead you can just restart on the middle part where you dont have to do everthing again from the begining of the mission. Also they make all realistic but the bad thing theres no pedestrians, overall il rate out of ten, il give 8/10!. at the first mission where you have to guide the truck to the trade center , the truck is a little bit bugged out , because its shaking/bouncing but still its a fun game.

												I got this game for Free Yesterday and I tried it out today after school. And wow. What a game!First of all, the bugs. Their just crazy! It's like they tried to make a physics game (Car collisions) with a ramped up Farming Simulator Engine! Just the collosions you can get with a train in either a small tunnel or some large scaffolding, the car is trapped then flung about!However, the voice acting is SO TERRIBLE that its funny! That and the content this game has is pretty decent. The AI cars are also well scripted and damagable. Ramming cars and caravans with the lorry is fun.Overall, is this game worth £6.77? Probably not. But its not far off. I would definitely reccomend this game to others!			"

												This game is just ridiculous. It could have been enjoyable if it wasn't for the many annoyances such as the silly mission format, which means that you do the first mission, and have no idea how to start the next part of the story. It just has a few other options such as patrol and race, and the other story parts are greyed out and unavailable... I would have liked to play more story, but it gives no clear indication as to how. The cars don't turn very well, the streets are littered with cars and the roads are narrow, so you will crash a lot. I know it's called crash time, but the driving is like a sim, and the game is trying to be an arcade racer such as the likes of burnout. So basically, it's really tedious, and would have been far better if they streamlined it and made it more accesible to play through. If you think driving while in the game is tedious, just try to get to the next bit of story through the menus. I quit because of that problem.			"

												I very rarely write negative reviews for games as I tend to see their positive side, but this game is atrocious. The graphics are nice, but the game is very poorly optimized. I can run Grid 2 at maximum graphics with 60fps, but this game still slightly lags on the lowest graphics. That being said, the voice acting is ridiculously awful, but that wouldn't even be a problem if the gameplay made up for it. The game is riddled with game breaking bugs and glitches, such as random respawning of enemies hundreds of meters away, which will result in a failed mission. I do not recommend this game to anyone. I got this game while it was on sale for 70 cents, and even that seemed way too high for this.			"

												so the trailer made this look like a game all about just crashing into cars, after watching videos of the game it turned out to look like a free roam game. after playing it im disapointed that its just a not too good police sim game. There are a lot of free roam maps which are decently large and a lot of unlockable maps, however when free roaming about every 5-10 min you are asked to do a mission which is very annoying. the missions give you no detail of what you are supposed to do.the graphics are okay im not one who cares about graphics that much, the vechicle damage does look good however sometimes the smallest tap can do a large amount of damage (not to you to cars on the street). the instant replay are nice but they are not accsessable after the replay (at least to my knowledge).i got this on sale 90% off, so i got my moneys worth (£0.69) i would not recommend it at full price though			"

												I got this game for free for some months ago, and I just finished this game a minute ago,aaand, I think I should share what this game feels like..,The graphics! It is beautiful and good! Consider that this game released in 2009 (2008 in Xbox 360, after I did some googling). It's surprising that the graphics still looks decent, even in lowest setting (I use low spec laptop, lol)Then the mission. I dont know. Sometimes, those mission are fun enough to play, but in another missions, those are so frustrating, especially for some mission that involve ramps in it (it's frustratingly hard, I nearly ripped off my hair).Voice acting.., kinda bad, but I can understand that this is not AAA budget game.The other bad things bout this game is the glitch issue. It makes the game nearly unplayable(lower the graphic setting will help).I'll give this game 7/10. It's fun to play.			"

												Crash Time 2 is an odd mix, but very enjoyable as a driving simulator for cruising around in the depicted german town. I'll preface by saying that I haven't played more than a few missions, but have spent hours cruising around.You get the brief impression from loading the game that it may have been re-branded from a more conventional german road driving simulator, but it almost liberates the player from taking their time on the road too seriously. The voice actors continue this first impression, causing the gamer to question exactly what subliminal german propaganda is being pumped through their speakers - because clearly, it can't be that superficial.. Yet, for all of its faults, there are plenty of great qualities. 1. The graphics are still nice and shiny on newer directX releases, and it holds up well over the span of 5 years - a virtual eternity, so to speak.2. The almost apathetic mixture of citizens and police driving around makes for some catastrophic crashes while business as usual goes on around them. 3. The driving itself, while not exactly precise in terms of the on-the-road handling physics, is pretty fun. It maintains a good balance between lively handling and classic arcade driving. The chases are a little easy if we're honest, but the crashes make it worthwhile.4. The comedy gold. If you start to look at the voice acting less as an actual attempt to create a dramatic environment and more of a strange video game cameo of mystery science theater 3000 post-translation, you'll be able to appreciate the rich social commentary presented between the lines. Bonus points for trying to drive with no front wheels, just a stream of sparks originating from your low-speed collision.5. The damage contest. While it's not a great idea when you're racing, one of the best parts of the game is seeing just how much property damage you can rack up before ""The engine exploded.""..4. Being $2.49 on sale occasionally. Very, very hard to complain about that.In short, if you come into the game expecting more than flat-out level driving performance, you'll probably be a little underwhelmed. But, if you load it up just to drive around and have a little fun driving like a maniac without the GTA-style shooting, it's a great way to mindlessly pass a few hours! "

												I though after reading a few reviews I would try this game. Racing games are my preferred area and the open world does make it more enjoyable. I do like the free roam aspect and the world does feel very open and available to explore, however that is only part of the game. Once I started playing the campaign it became a very different story. I setup my campaign on normal thinking that the missions would be pretty basic pursuits and escorts. I was wrong. The missions don’t seem to have much set direction, such as you can go one route on one play and a different route on another play. Now yes this may sound like ""well that’s cool it keeps you on the edge."" and it would be that way except most events have a distance bar that if the target gets farther than 200m away you lose the event. so when you’re on the highway and the suspect takes an unexpected exit yes you may be able to break quickly and stop just after the exit but by the time you turn around and get going again you’ve already lost the event. I would give the game a 3.5 out of 5, the open world aspect is good and the driving and drive physics are good and do make driving enjoyable. However, the fact that even on normal the campaign is difficult and frustrating it makes enjoying the game difficult, you can’t get new cars without beating campaign events so you are pretty much forced to play the events over and over again. I do like the game but I wouldn’t recommend it, I only paid 2.50 for it so I'm not disappointed in it but I feel if you paid full price you may be.			"

The damage ratio in between you and other cars, is often tilted to where you get far more damage for doing something small.I play minecraft, and minecraft is in a constant state of ""buggy"". Although, minecraft 99.9% of the time is playable all the same. This game's bugs are many, and most are game / mission breaking. This is one of the few cases that I say the bugs outweigh the worth.

												I had bought this game thinking i would have a burn out style experience, CHUCK TESTA.  The missions are awful if you crash the wrong way even if your car isn't destroyed entirely you can't move, I haven't completed a single mission do to this fact.  I enjoy Burn Out style racing games where you are rewarded with a nicely destroyed car.  I can't even begin to tell you hoe bad the voice acting is I am never one to pick on voice acting but holy ♥♥♥♥ is it bad.  If I had previous knowledge about this games ♥♥♥ suckage i wouldn't have even considered buying it.  Too be fair it can be fun at times to drive inasnely fast and then crash and RESART THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME FROM THE MAIN MENU.  No restart, you have to: pause, reload mission, repick your car, redo all the stuff you did before the mission (driving to the location and doing what ever things you have to do there.)  The graphics are pretty good though just to ease the pain on the devs.  I liked driving through the city i find it to be the only thing I ever do when I play this game but for me I just can't stand the fact of the way to resart the game. 2/10			"

												This game's great. The driving physics are like GTA 4's but without all the derp, but twice the fun. Some of the missions are a bit frustrating but once you get the hang of it (usually by replaying the mission once or twice) you'll be fine. I would like to see maybe a clearer tutorial and more explanation of the various key bindings (Using R to reattach wheels or un-stick yourself)All in all, 8/10. Get it sometime when it's on sale.

												The driving mechanics in this game are good, it runs smoothly, and the game has high-quality models and maps, however, the gamemodes are limited to free roam, racing, and police chasing.

												The only reason I have this game is because it was for free. This game can offer you some fun for 1 hour, maybe 2. The open world is amusing for a while but just crashing people get bored adter the fifth time. Beside the open world there are some mission you can play, but trust me, you don't want to do them. You can repeat the same mission 10 times because the car you are chasing has just teleported away from you and you can't keep up. In conclusion, if it is still free on Bundle stars get it, but if the deal is over do yourself a favor and do something valuable with this 10$.			"

												A very fun game and also they have good graphics especially on ground and cars texture. but they have to fix where, for example if you fail a mission you must restart from the start instead you can just restart on the middle part where you dont have to do everthing again from the begining of the mission. Also they make all realistic but the bad thing theres no pedestrians, overall il rate out of ten, il give 8/10!. at the first mission where you have to guide the truck to the trade center , the truck is a little bit bugged out , because its shaking/bouncing but still its a fun game.

												Got it for cheap. Went into it expecting an unironically bad game, got an ironically good game instead. I didn't even know it was based off of a TV show.Pros:- You have almost absolute control over your vehicle and beyond. Everything from blinkers to nitro boosters to camera angles to slow motion. (I found even the keyboard controls to be acceptable, but I do recommend an Xbox 360 controller.) AI will sometimes respond to your vehicle's behavior. Damage can range from a smashed bumper to a popped tire to engine failure.- Best handling cars I've ever controlled in a game. Each one has its own strengths and weaknesses, and there are quite a bit to drive. Even with the huge variety, I rarely find myself losing control of any vehicle. This contributes to the feeling of the game feeling like an actual challenge, instead of feeling like I've been forced to drive a gimped vehicle.- Decent graphics. Some of it looks akward, such as the lack of civilians, and the building pop-in from the skyboxes. The chromatic aberration was a good call, and the texture detail is agreeable. I especially like the cows who explode into steak with a single touch.Cons:- Sometimes hard to figure out where to go and what to do. I've wasted a bit of time during and between missions searching on the internet for what I need to do to progress, as the game often does not explain it well enough. I didn't know how to start a mission or what button I needed to press to detonate a drone, before looking through outside sources. The minimap also fits into this category. It does not show all of the roads, and often suggests a longer path that wastes more time.- Some of the missions suffer from strange design. It's hard to explain, there are so many different things, but I'll take an example: The Poisoned Beer mission. All you have to do it pull up next to the truck and hold that position for a few seconds to get it to stop. I mean, I get it, I've beaten it, I've done that mission several times. It doesn't matter if you beat him to the supermarket or are just a few seconds late, you fail if you don't do that. Does that really conform to logic? If a truck smashed my there-and-waiting police car out of the way to park behind the market, would I really say ""Uh-oh, guess I didn't get there in time?""- The voice actors for the main characters are terrible. It's localization at its worst. It's so bad that it makes the rest of the voice acting sound good.Meh:- The music might as well not exist. It's not terrible, but I don't think it adds anything either. It can be turned off if you want.- Again, localization. Except for the voice acting, it's not horrific, but even changing the text language does not change the spoken language, so you're kind of screwed either way in that department. Also, there's a lot of German signage to notice during the game, some of which can be pretty amusing.Overall, the game is pretty good, or at least, better than I would have been previously lead to believe.Now, I must make my ausfahrt... I mean, exit.			"

												I very rarely write negative reviews for games as I tend to see their positive side, but this game is atrocious. The graphics are nice, but the game is very poorly optimized. I can run Grid 2 at maximum graphics with 60fps, but this game still slightly lags on the lowest graphics. That being said, the voice acting is ridiculously awful, but that wouldn't even be a problem if the gameplay made up for it. The game is riddled with game breaking bugs and glitches, such as random respawning of enemies hundreds of meters away, which will result in a failed mission. I do not recommend this game to anyone.

												so the trailer made this look like a game all about just crashing into cars, after watching videos of the game it turned out to look like a free roam game. after playing it im disapointed that its just a not too good police sim game. There are a lot of free roam maps which are decently large and a lot of unlockable maps, however when free roaming about every 5-10 min you are asked to do a mission which is very annoying. the missions give you no detail of what you are supposed to do.the graphics are okay im not one who cares about graphics that much, the vechicle damage does look good however sometimes the smallest tap can do a large amount of damage (not to you to cars on the street). the instant replay are nice but they are not accsessable after the replay (at least to my knowledge).i got this on sale 90% off, so i got my moneys worth (£0.69) i would not recommend it at full price though			"

												The games free roam mode sure has some glance to it. In my opinion the developer(s) should put their minds only to the open world game since the missions are hard and quite boring.

												So it is Crash Time. Number 2. Let's take a closer look. ProsThe car handling is alright, good to control. Physics are ""okay"", have seen worse and have seen better. Car chasing is fun of course, put on some proper chasing music (top tip: Miami Vice Theme) and it is just great. The game was made for this chasing and so it earns all points there. There's a small selection of cars; just like in Burnout there are no real brands, but the cars are based upon real cars. It's not Miami Vice with Ferraris and Lamborghinis, but driving a huge pickup, Porsche Cayenne or BMW like car does satisfy.ConsThere are some down sides though, it is a rather cheap game so do not expect a full Need For Speed or BurnOut like experience. It all feels a bit cheap, and it doesn't really do anything out of the ordinary. The English voice acting is just terrible. It's best to just turn it off, reading the subtitles instead of hearing the voice is much better. The music isn't anything special at all too. And there are some design mistakes. Such as you are in a chase, you stopped the chased car, and then suddenly it respawns itself back to the street, because you'll have to damage it up to 100%. However, when this happens you'll have to chase it again, and probably you were somewhere off the street. The target will escape, and you'll have to start over again. What the hell is up with that. So watch yourself out there when doing big moves.VerdictA fun little police game. There are better ones out there, but that'll mean a bigger price. It's great fun for just 1 euro, and you can hardly score wrong for that price.			"

												I though after reading a few reviews I would try this game. Racing games are my preferred area and the open world does make it more enjoyable. I do like the free roam aspect and the world does feel very open and available to explore, however that is only part of the game. Once I started playing the campaign it became a very different story. I setup my campaign on normal thinking that the missions would be pretty basic pursuits and escorts. I was wrong. The missions don’t seem to have much set direction, such as you can go one route on one play and a different route on another play. Now yes this may sound like ""well that’s cool it keeps you on the edge."" and it would be that way except most events have a distance bar that if the target gets farther than 200m away you lose the event. so when you’re on the highway and the suspect takes an unexpected exit yes you may be able to break quickly and stop just after the exit but by the time you turn around and get going again you’ve already lost the event. I would give the game a 3.5 out of 5, the open world aspect is good and the driving and drive physics are good and do make driving enjoyable. However, the fact that even on normal the campaign is difficult and frustrating it makes enjoying the game difficult, you can’t get new cars without beating campaign events so you are pretty much forced to play the events over and over again. I do like the game but I wouldn’t recommend it, I only paid 2.50 for it so I'm not disappointed in it but I feel if you paid full price you may be.			"

												Crash Time 2 is an odd mix, but very enjoyable as a driving simulator for cruising around in the depicted german town. I'll preface by saying that I haven't played more than a few missions, but have spent hours cruising around.You get the brief impression from loading the game that it may have been re-branded from a more conventional german road driving simulator, but it almost liberates the player from taking their time on the road too seriously. The voice actors continue this first impression, causing the gamer to question exactly what subliminal german propaganda is being pumped through their speakers - because clearly, it can't be that superficial.. Yet, for all of its faults, there are plenty of great qualities. 1. The graphics are still nice and shiny on newer directX releases, and it holds up well over the span of 5 years - a virtual eternity, so to speak.2. The almost apathetic mixture of citizens and police driving around makes for some catastrophic crashes while business as usual goes on around them. 3. The driving itself, while not exactly precise in terms of the on-the-road handling physics, is pretty fun. It maintains a good balance between lively handling and classic arcade driving. The chases are a little easy if we're honest, but the crashes make it worthwhile.4. The comedy gold. If you start to look at the voice acting less as an actual attempt to create a dramatic environment and more of a strange video game cameo of mystery science theater 3000 post-translation, you'll be able to appreciate the rich social commentary presented between the lines. Bonus points for trying to drive with no front wheels, just a stream of sparks originating from your low-speed collision.5. The damage contest. While it's not a great idea when you're racing, one of the best parts of the game is seeing just how much property damage you can rack up before ""The engine exploded.""..4. Being $2.49 on sale occasionally. Very, very hard to complain about that.In short, if you come into the game expecting more than flat-out level driving performance, you'll probably be a little underwhelmed. But, if you load it up just to drive around and have a little fun driving like a maniac without the GTA-style shooting, it's a great way to mindlessly pass a few hours! "

 Crash Time 2. The best bad game out there.  tl;dr buy it on sale An open world game about European Police. Well, A European city with british coppers. With stock sounds, laughable voice acting and a physics engine that doesn't quite understand mass you'll definately have a strange, yet somewhat enjoyable experience playing this game.  The voice acting in this game is quite bad. However if you pair that with the terrible jokes slipped in, it actually becomes quite humourous, for the wrong reasons of course. The sound effects are stock sounds and the soundtrack is mediocre but expected for this type of game. You can put your own music in the game which will help you play for a little bit longer. Although the process of putting your music in could be tedious if you're not familiar with file explorers.  The graphics are actually quite good. There are great lighting and shadow effects and the textures are high resolution. The models of the vehicles are quite reasonable and there is a lot of detail in the damage of the cars. Realistic or not, it definately brings the game up. Now, talking of the damage of the cars, there is definately a lot of detail put in and the damage is local to where you hit. Parts of the vehicle will hang off and debris will come from the vehicles. The vehicles also stop break down if you sustain too much damage to the engine area, though this can be annoying.However, the vehicles do not crumple and wheels fly off at almost all high speed crashes. NPC vehicles explode with little damage, with their explosions causing no damage to surrounding vehicles. Also if you're travelling at ~90mph or above, most vehicles will just be smashed out of the way with little effect on your speed, which brings me on to the physics engine. Vehicles that are part of the missions are better at taking collisions. But the physics are inconsistent. You can spin out a vehicle with a slight tap, yet if you shunt them from behind they experience next to no loss of control. This is quite annoying when you have to take down a vehicle as you have to wait for them to turn a corner so you can smash them in the side at high speed if you want to do any damage. The handling of the vehicles isn't the best. But it's not quite the worst. It's easy to slalom and weave through traffic but if you want to turn a corner at high speed, you're gonna have a bad time. You need to slow down to near stopping point if you want to turn the corner without completely missing it or smashing into a wall and have a wheel fly off. Is it worth the money? I bought it for 69p (~$1), and I'm cetain I  haven't  wasted my money. The normal price is around £7 (~$11) and I would be reluctant pay that for the game. But I'm a bit of a cheapskate. If I payed around £3.50 (~$5.55), I wouldn't be dissappointed.  Should you buy it? I'd say  yes!  Even with all these bad points, I still like the game. It's almost as if you don't notice it when playing; you never really expected much from it anyway. I could play this for an hour or so burst before I would get bored of it. Not to say I wouldn't come back to it. The  humour  in the voice acting and custom soundtrack should keep you going through the missions. It's not a bad game really.			"

The voice acting is horribly bad, but the rest of the game is pretty decent.The physics aren't the best, but much better than many low budget games. The crash damage is pretty nice, i thoroughly enjoy  accidentally hitting a wall at highway speeds and having the front wheels fly off as the engine lands in my lap.I would not recommend this game at the full $9.99 price.In my opinion, any price below $5 would be worth it.

You didn't expect the best gameplay, innovative new features, or anything like that.  You expect to just have a lot of random fun playing, and this game provides just that.  You may not remember the story, but you'll have fun doing what it is you're doing, and you won't be able to figure out why.			"

												For what the trailer shows, you may be expecting a high octane racing game with amazing crash physics.Okay, the graphics are there, but what you actually get is a shoddy open world need for speed undercover rip-off with the voice acting of a pre-schooler's christmas play, and the storyline that gives the narrative value of Donald Trump's left testicle. The missions are aggrovating as they are near impossible to complete, with stupid objectives that seem almost completely unrelated as to where the story MIGHT be going. Quite honestly, I was majorly let down, and for those of you who are looking for a game in this series, check out the consderably better 'Crash Time III"", or if you're looking for carnage style racing, check out games such as Burnout Paradise (also open world), or Gas Guzzlers Extreme (It has guns - yay).Rating:  2/10 Potatoes			"

												Before I can start to talk about the gameplay I have to note how much troble I had geting the game to work on windows 8.1. When I first started the game, it opened BW setup. when BW setup opened I thought it would be a simple ""click the play button"".  it turns out that it needed to be running in win vista mode to work, but even after I set it to it`s recommeneded setings for compatability it gave me a frozen screen. so what I had to do was set one of the three game exacutables to win xp mode(I tried vista and it didnt work) it finally played ( my face :| ).Now that I finally got this stubborn exacutable to work I started by playing the tutorial. The tutorial displayed greate control for the nature of the game, But it does not tell you what the controls are. so when it tells you to use the action button, I find myself testing every button on the keyboard (the action button is F). therefore I found that this game makes use of hazard lights, both blinkers, sirens, and turbo.other than the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tutorial the phisics are decent, the cars look good graphicaly, and I can see how this game can be enjoyable.BUT I will only recomend  this game if you can get it for cheap.

												Got it for cheap. Went into it expecting an unironically bad game, got an ironically good game instead. I didn't even know it was based off of a TV show.Pros:- You have almost absolute control over your vehicle and beyond. Everything from blinkers to nitro boosters to camera angles to slow motion. (I found even the keyboard controls to be acceptable, but I do recommend an Xbox 360 controller.) AI will sometimes respond to your vehicle's behavior. Damage can range from a smashed bumper to a popped tire to engine failure.- Best handling cars I've ever controlled in a game. Each one has its own strengths and weaknesses, and there are quite a bit to drive. Even with the huge variety, I rarely find myself losing control of any vehicle. This contributes to the feeling of the game feeling like an actual challenge, instead of feeling like I've been forced to drive a gimped vehicle.- Decent graphics. Some of it looks akward, such as the lack of civilians, and the building pop-in from the skyboxes. The chromatic aberration was a good call, and the texture detail is agreeable. I especially like the cows who explode into steak with a single touch.Cons:- Sometimes hard to figure out where to go and what to do. I've wasted a bit of time during and between missions searching on the internet for what I need to do to progress, as the game often does not explain it well enough. I didn't know how to start a mission or what button I needed to press to detonate a drone, before looking through outside sources. The minimap also fits into this category. It does not show all of the roads, and often suggests a longer path that wastes more time.- Some of the missions suffer from strange design. It's hard to explain, there are so many different things, but I'll take an example: The Poisoned Beer mission. All you have to do it pull up next to the truck and hold that position for a few seconds to get it to stop. I mean, I get it, I've beaten it, I've done that mission several times. It doesn't matter if you beat him to the supermarket or are just a few seconds late, you fail if you don't do that. Does that really conform to logic? If a truck smashed my there-and-waiting police car out of the way to park behind the market, would I really say ""Uh-oh, guess I didn't get there in time?""- The voice actors for the main characters are terrible. It's localization at its worst. It's so bad that it makes the rest of the voice acting sound good.Meh:- The music might as well not exist. It's not terrible, but I don't think it adds anything either. It can be turned off if you want.- Again, localization. Except for the voice acting, it's not horrific, but even changing the text language does not change the spoken language, so you're kind of screwed either way in that department. Also, there's a lot of German signage to notice during the game, some of which can be pretty amusing.Overall, the game is pretty good, or at least, better than I would have been previously lead to believe.Now, I must make my ausfahrt... I mean, exit.			"

												I may be late to the review party, but I finally got around to finishing this game. I've owned it for probably over a year. But, as this is on Steam, there are bound to be more gamers giving it a go. So, here is my review on Crash Time 2: Burning Wheels. When I first picked it up, I really wanted to like it.Now, don't get me wrong, I do not hate it; I just don't like it...much.I will dive right in with the Pros-v-Cons.Pros:+ Graphics:  Despite a little too much bloom effect on some of the models, and the occasional clipping, the overall graphic quality of the game was enjoyable.+ Control:  There is a catch (see Cons). I use an XBox 360 controller for all racers, and the control is fairly good in this with the occasional understeer issues aside. For me, keyboards just don't make good racers. The on/off switch controls just won't cut it in my opinion. Kudos to those who can pull it off with good results.+ Comedic Value:  The translation from German to English is laughable at times. And the English voice acting is, in a word, atrocious. I would love to hear feedback from German speaking gamers on whether or not the original actors/script were any better. + Soundtrack:  Great rockin' soundtrack and the ability to add your own tracks made for an enjoyable time. + Damage System:  I loved how the car fell apart and stopped performing accordingly.Cons: - But that Camera:  Here's the control catch. My first issue was the camera. Too often, I found myself going around a winding road corner and smacking right into another car that I could not see from the camera scheme offered. Or worse yet, a sneaky little outcropping in the wall, strategically placed to catch you unaware and throw you off your line. Both things that you could see in the first person camera if not for the lack of left/right control. The 3rd person high camera was what I would typically gravitate toward, but you still could not see what was coming around the corner. I realize some driving line planning is in order here, but being able to use the right joystick for camera control left and right would have been ideal. Nobody drives with there head and eyes glued straight forward.  Unless, of course they are staring at a cell phone (Don't even get me started on that).- Stick to the Mission. What Mission???:  At times, finding missions was harder than it should have been. I've read, in several online posts, that you had to be in a particular car, in a particular place, for HQ to contact you. However, in many missions, I would start off in said particular vehicle only to have to drive back and switch to another vehicle to continue the mission. It shouldn't be that difficult.I actually enjoyed playing this game once I figured out the no mission issue.  I always read reviews to know what I'm getting into before purchasing a game.  Occasionally, I will steer clear of one because of them.  However, ultimately, enjoyment really depends on each individual gamer.Would I pay sticker price for this game?   Well, THAT is what I read reviews for. As much as I love to support the creators as much as possible, I am on a limited budget so the games I pay full price for need to be really worth it.  So, the answer to the question, is no.  That being said, I will most likely be trying ""Crash Time 3: Highway Nights"" soon. And I hope the other 2 installments will be released in the U.S. as well.  Why?  Because most people tend to get better as they learn more and develop their craft.  I hope the same rings true for Synetic.  Everyone has to start somewhere.  Give ""Crash Time 2: Burning Wheels. "" a try. It's no Need for Speed, or other big budget racer, but it can be entertaining.			"

												I got this game for free and its not bad for a free game. Way better then all the other ones i have recived. Nice game, but there are some glitches and controls that need to be fixed. Overall good game, great graphics for its time. I would not reccomend buying at full price though.			"

												I found Crash Time II to be a rather enjoyable car chase/racing game that allows you to speed through a European city and wreck havoc, while no one seems to mind.  The trick to really enjoying this game, however, is that you have to get past the frustrating first mission.  You know how most games give you easy tasks at the beginning of the game, and just about the time you think you got the hang of it, the difficulty ramps up until you begin to feel like a failure?  Crash Time II does just the opposite.   The first mission requires you to perform a rather tricky maneuver, followed by extensive car chase in which you need to disable the car you are pursuing by ramming it over and over until it's an immobile pile of metal.  This is more difficult than it sounds, especially when you are new to the game.  In fact, it took me over three hours to complete the level.  After that, however, the game became much easier, with the next several missions being timed tasks, races, or chases that only require pinning your target instead of destroying them.  Yes, the game has several other frustrating missions that require multiple attempts, but by this time your skill is better and they don’t take as long or seem as daunting. I played this game both with a controller and with a keyboard and mouse.  Personally, I have no preference and found both methods adequate.Helpful Tips to make the game more fun and reduce frustration: 1.  Play in easy mode.  The chase missions are hard enough -- a simple wrong turn can allow an enemy to escape in an instant.  2.  Read the manual.  At least scan it. I spent a lot of time driving around doing nothing early in the game until I read the manual and figured out why missions weren't triggering.  3.  When you are required to completely disable another vehicle, avoid pinning it for too long.  Back off and let it get going before ramming it again.  What the game neglects to tell you is that all the criminals have graduated from Hogwarts and, when pinned, will suddenly disappear and reappear elsewhere, sometimes far enough away that they can escape before you even have time to turn your vehicle around.  Finally, the voice acting is brilliant!  No, I didn’t say it was good, well written or well acted.  Just brilliant.			"

												-->WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!<--In the trailer the game looks awesome, but in reality it's a piece of CRAP!All object in the game are like stuck with paper glue.You can destroy a metal billboard only when you touch it! What a joke of a game! Just follow my advice: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES! Save your money and buy something else.			"

												This game is awful.The story is poor and unbelievable. The gameplay mechanics are infuriating. The AI is laughable. I couldn't play more than a few hours of this and unfortunately I got it in the days before returns were possible. I would personally not recommend you get this game - but this is only based on the few hours I played of it.So, keep this review in mind if you like driving games and are thinking of buying it, but have a short fuse/tendency to rage quit.
