												Batman: Arkham Asylum is a solid game. It has everything going for it: a good story, good gameplay, graphics, cutscenes, voice acting, combat, and stealth. If you weren't a Batman fan before, this game will change that for you.			"

												Still the best Batman game in the Arkham series and probably the best Batman game ever made. The story involves Batman catching Joker easily after a recent robbery and, coincidentally, Joker's gang moved to the Asylum because of an issue at the Blackgate Prison - once inside the Asylum, the Joker escapes and taskes control of the Asylum and prepares to unearth something far worse than what you initially suspect. You play as Batman trying to unearth this plot and once again stop the Joker.To this day, this game still has amazing visuals, Batman himself covering around half the screen, looks the part and stands strong and confident as the character should as well as the texture work on his suit are top notch - the rest of the game fairs the same, since the game has been given an outstanding amount of care and work into every area you go through. Not one area in the game feels exactly the same as another even if they look similar. Very stellar work of textures all around overall.           I don't say this is the best Batman game out there for no reason - gameplay is pretty basic ""Brawler"" style with very minor puzzle solving, but what makes this game different, from, say a game like Assassin's Creed - is the ""Free Flow combat system"" the game has. The combat is slightly similar to the first Assassin's Creed, except - the flow combat system allows Batman to basically jump from one foe to another in a very fast manner, almost rythmically, to get a combo counter to go as high as you can while still making it challenging by giving the foes still standing a fighting chance and implementing counters.             You can also explore the entirety of the Arkham Asylum as you unlock areas and you can do a variety of things while exploring, you can face groups of enemies scattered around, you can do Riddler Challenges - whom are a bunch of mini puzzles scattered around the Asylum that involves the use of Batman's Detective Mode, these range from finding a specific item found in the area or marks that require the Detective Mode to find and a ""Complete the Mark"" type of game that involves you scanning the area from specific places to complete a full mark, etc - Riddler trophies, and a bunch of case files to find out more background information on Batman characters and villains (as well as the history behind Arkahm Asylum) that are often very well realized and fun to hear.             The Detective Mode & Gadgets: You'll be using these a LOT on your trudge through Arkham Asylum. Ranging from the standard Batarangs and Grappling hook (used for mundane objectives such as getting to and pulling out vents from hard to reach places, etc), the Explosive Gel (Used a lot to surprise enemies, to find weak walls to find trophies and secrets and to progress in the story as well!) and a bunch more. The Detecive Mode helps you analyze weak walls to use your Explosive Gel on and other gadgets as well as analyze enemy/allies conditions and, more important later on in the game, to find out which enemies carry weapons or are special enemies.).So in general, if you ever wanted to know and feel what a life in the day of Batman is, this is definately your game, more so than the sequels (imo). From the excellent assets and sound to follow it up with, and the pitch perfect gameplay to go along with it, this sits as one of my favourite video game experiences and currently my best experience playing as the legendary Dark Knight.

			A short video showcasing combat in the game Batman: Arkham Asylum.		

This game captures what it is to be batman and my god its DAMN FUN. The developers going into making Arkham Asylum said ""What can we do to make you feel like batman right away, as soon as we give the player control we want them to feel like a bad ♥♥♥. You feel like batman, the way your character is animated and moves, the freeflow combat system has you jumping around bruising bad people until the cows come home with some of the most satisfying combat I have played to date. Here is a huge thing for me, and for all Batman fans. I watched the cartoon as a kid. Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamil all brought the cartoon and that world to vivid life. Well guess what guys, they got just about everyone from the cartoon to revoice their characters in Arkham Asylum, Harley, Gordon, Batman, Joker, Scarcrow etc.

			Should you answer the signal?		

 It is an incredible cast and it immerses you so fully in the world you almost never want to leave. The world that Rocksteady has recreated is fantastic, with dark colors and almost a noirish feel to the game that sucks you deeper and deeper into the world. You truly ARE batman in this game. It reminds me of a mixture of the cartoon and Tim Burtons dark seedy take on Batman. It is truly a game to be experianced.So would I recommend this game? Abso♥♥♥♥inglutely. If you enjoy 3rd person fighting games with smooth combat systems that just make you want to sing while you are playing them. THIS GAME IS FOR YOU. If you are a fan of the Batman universe, cartoon, or comics YOU OWE it to yourself to pick up and play this game. It is absolutely fantastic.I would recommend this game to just about anyone who enjoys a solid, FUN game in every aspect.

TL:DR? See CONCLUSIONNOTE: Since this is the first game in the franchise, I will review it as if the sequels did not exist.INTRODUCTION:Batman Arkham Asylum is an action-adventure game and the first title on the critically acclaimed Arkham franchise. The game was released in 2009, developed by Rocksteady Studios and published by Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment. Arkham Asylum currently (as of the writing of this review 2014), holds the Guinness World Record for “Most critically acclaimed superhero videogame” as well as several Game of the Year awards. The Story was written by Paul Dini who's notable work include Batman: Animated Series and Batman Beyond.PLOT (No Spoilers):In this game Batman, after just having apprehended the Joker,  takes him to the now infamous Arkham Asylum. Unfortunately, Batman soon realizes that it was all part of Joker's plan in an elaborate scheme to stage a major prison riot and take over the Asylum. Now trapped, Batman has to stop the Joker and at the same time, discover whatever sinister plot the Joker has started which seems to involve a new drug called Titan.PROS:+ Graphically beautiful with amazing locations, well textured characters and environment+ Excellent Voice acting from the cast, specially on Kevin Conroy (Batman) and Mark Hamill (Joker)+ Combat Mechanic (Free Flow Combat) that goes well with...+ Fluid Animation quality where Batman can chain attacks with absolute grace+ Lots of cool gadgets and upgrades that can aid you in several situations+ Perfect blend of Action and Stealth without sacrificing either one+ Scarecrow Segments and Riddler Challenges+ Great use of the Batman Lore with cameo appearances or references to other characters and locations in the Batman Universe+ Excellent Story that really draws you in+ Re-playability due to unlockable Challenges and a New Game Plus+ Easy to learn controls and game mechanic+ Relatively medium sized map that rewards exploration+ Excessive amount of bone breaking physical violenceCONS:- Detective mode can be abused by perpetually leaving it active since it has no real drawback- Underwhelming Mini bosses who can be defeated in more or less the same manner- VERY disappointing Boss (Super Villain) battles which is perhaps the game's greatest flaw- Combat mechanic can potentially become repetitive- Games For Windows Live- Game does not include a Shark RepellentCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME and a GOOD BUY. Arkham Asylum provides you with tons of enjoyable hours playing as the Dark Knight because of its excellent story and game mechanics.WORTH IT?:Highly recommended to Batman, Martial arts or Stealth fans out there. At $20 for its full price this game is worth every penny and it should be a no-brainer when you see it on a sale.FINAL NOTES:The game is a great comicbook / cartoon to video game adaptation of Batman. Easy to learn and use of the freeflow combat mechanic coupled with a well implemented stealth system makes the gameplay fun. The story is true to the formula that made most Batman cartoons and animated movies great with some added violence and mature content. Engaging and lovely atmosphere that is amplified by the excellent voice acting quality from the cast. Although the bosses in this game does not live up to the build up of the story, it still nonetheless wraps up each story arc pretty neatly.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												In 2009, Rocksteady Studios, a video game studio with virtually no history restored gamers' hopes all around world with Batman Arkham Asylum. The UK based studio revived a genre long forgotten and delivered a superhero action game which is worth every cent you spend on it.Yes, yes, there hasn't been a shortage of superhero games in the 21st century, but none of them really delivered on its potential. And there is a bunch like the Iromnan or Superman games that aren't even worth talking about. Batman always had the better track record when it comes to games, but Arkham Asylum fires on all cylinders. Great graphics, incredible sound effects, a mad story and the little details will engage gamers and not only Batman and superhero fans. The game takes place on the famous Arkham Island where an Asylum has been build many-many years ago for the worst criminals Gotham can offer. It happens that The Joker has been captured by the Bats and taken in, but the Dark Knight suspects there is something going on in the background and takes his nemesis in himself. Shortly after a riot is started and The Joker gets loose. Now it's clear that the clown has something on his mind and Batman has to stop him. The story is intense and interesting as Bruce Wayne slowly puts together the pieces of Joker's grand plan. As you progress several of Batman's greatest foes will try to stop you, most notably Killer Croc, Poison Ivy or Bane, but others are introduced too. Some of them get bigger space others are bit players, but the point is that they are in the game and by their presence they make it richer.The graphics are decent, but there are flaws here and there. Batman and The Joker look superb, but detail of minor characters aren't on that level and some even look ugly. Other than that, the island is looks beautiful and from the distance you can see Gotham, the city of sins. The game is very well optimized on the PC so gamers with older rigs won't have problem running it. Even tough the island isn't overwhelmingly large, there is a lot to do. The main campaign will take around 8 hours to finish plus you can solve the puzzles and collect the question marks The Riddler left for you. By doing those you unlock character profiles, concept arts and more, so it's far from time wasting. Also by specific scanning stone tables on the island you can unlock recordings that tell you about the story of Arkham Asylum narrated by Amadeus Arkham himself. Probably the most interesting collectibles are the patient interview tapes that are scattered around the island. Some of the villains were interviewed in the facility and you can listen to these well composed dialogues. If you want to complete the main story with all the collectibles you will spend around 14+ hours on the island. When this is done you can try challenge missions where you have to beat scores by beating thugs. Sounds interesting and it adds to the game. This is the place where you can perfect you combat skills as the challenges get more and more difficult. The other half of them puts you in rooms where you have to complete 3, mostly skill-based tasks. With the near perfect free flow combat Arkham City is a near perfect game that finally delivers not only to fans of the genre but also to Batman and superhero fans. In fact, those who are not really in comic books should consider this game for first. It's a joy to play every second of this game. Arkham Asylum set the bar for every single superhero game that comes after 2009. It's a benchmark and an example to follow for every publisher and developer.Rating: 90/100; Replay Value: 3/5; To Beat: 8 hours (main campaign), 14 hours (campaign with collectibles); Played on: normal.

												Here are a few quotes from the game that are reason enough to buy it.The Joker: [Over the P.A. system] Ding d-ding, dong! Joker here! Here's what's new in the asylum... Some idiot is running around the asylum, dressed like a bat...! I know! Crazy! He should be considered costumed and dangerous. [laughter] Thug: Allright the bombs are on the gargoyles. Joker: Ok, Here goes!Thug: BUT WAIT IM STILL UP HERE <BOOM>Joker: Oops. Employee's wife: Hello? Is anyone there? I'm trying to reach Steve!Joker: One moment, I'll see if I can find him!Employee's Wife: Thank you.*after a second*Joker: Sorry, but I can only find his head! I'll get back to you when I find the rest of him!The Joker: [Over the P.A. system] Tell me Bats. What are you really scared of? Failing to save this cesspool of a city? Not finding the Commissioner in time? Me, in a thong?The Joker: Paging Dr Bat, paging Dr Bat, is there a Dr Bat in the room?			"

												This game is one of the best superhero games of this generations. What makes it is so is the fact that that it makes you feel like the protagonist. The fighting the style, the gadgets, detective mode and the way you use them make an unforgettable gameplay experience. The story is dark and the conflict between Batman and his nemesis makes it brilliant. The challanges add to the game, making you play it after you finish the campaign(there is a cool skin available).This game doesn't age, since there is none like it(except for it's sequel). It is a high-class experience and a fun 100% completion. The score it deserves in todays day is 9.6.			"

												The best Batman game ever created and I would have to say that it ranks among the best superhero games.  Arkham Asylum does a great job of making you feel like you are actually the Batman with it's excellent formula of action, stealth, gadgetry and puzzle-solving.  The cleverly designed freeflow and combo combat systems allow for a lot of flexibility in direct combat situations and the silent predator gameplay allows for a more indirect and stealthy way to take out enemies.  What amazes me the most about this game is how well the story flows with the large number of antagonists and how it does a magnificent job of progression and pacing to keep things interesting without losing focus.  The atmosphere of the asylum setting and the perfect voice acting really adds to the immersion of the game.  If you are a Batman fan, or a fan of superhero games, then you should find a lot of fun in this game.			"

												A very good game, filled with basic but efficient stealth mechanics, a good fighting system, and interesting gadgets. Lots of collectible items and hidden secrets that explain the lore and story furthermore.The graphics are still pretty nice, even though the game is 4 years old.The only downside, to me, might be the amount of backtracking: you will often go back to the already previously visited places to be able to advance in the missions. But that's about it, really. The game is enjoyable enough, I had a lot of fun with it.			"

The stealth mechanics are excellent and I many times felt ""awesome"" while playing it.The controls are ok with keyboard and mouse but I strongly recommend playing with a controller since it's mainly a fighting game.All in all a great game that dosn't require to much on your pc, so it will run on a older PC.

												Batman: Arkham Asylum is a Beat 'em up set in, well, the Arkham Asylum (?) You are vengeance... you’re the night Batman and after you catch Joker, who was strangely willing to go with you, without a fight, you go to the Asylum to make sure he doesn’t try anything funny. Bad part is you fail, good part is the Asylum gets out of control and is up to you to solve the situation, but remember, Joker is not the only one there, so you have to prepare yourself for a long, long night.★★★★☆ | Liked it "

Batman: Arkham Asylum - GOTY EditionDeveloper: Rocksteady StudiosPublisher: Warner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentIntroduction==========Batman. One of the world's most popular superheroes. The Dark Knight first made his appearance in 1939, in Detective Comics #27. Since then he has appeared in countless other comics, several films, several animated series, and a nice handful of video games. Arkham Asylum is the first of the 4 currently available mainstream Batman video game titles. For a long time most gamers considered movie tie-in or superhero games to be....well, sub-par and not very impressive or satisfying. Just look at Superman 64. Wait....don't. Let's take a look at Batman and see how he fares.Gameplay==========The Joker has hatched yet another plan; a plan to bring Batman to Arkham to have him face all the criminals he’s put away there. Yes, the inmates are running the asylum, and Batman aficionados are going to get a full dose of Jim Gordon, Oracle, The Riddler, Bane, Harley Quinn, Killer Croc, Scarecrow, Victor Zsasz, Poison Ivy, The Joker, and others. Themed similarly to the graphic novel of the same title, it is nonetheless a completely original adventure as Batman fights his way from one side of Arkham Island to the other rescuing Gordon and guards, doctors and nurses and others, while putting a stop to The Joker’s nefarious scheme.Batman: Arkham Asylum does one thing extremely well: It puts you in the shoes of the Dark Knight. It makes you feel like you ARE Batman. You have all of the signature gadgets available to you (not all at the start, of course) and using them to solve puzzles and beat down baddies is a complete joy. The combat system that started in this game has since been emulated many times by other game franchises (Shadow of Mordor, as an example), but none of those are anywhere near as good as the Batman titles. I can only describe combat in this game with one single word: fluid. Batman’s motions are fluid, continuous, and definitely not a set of disconnected moves. He looks like a martial artist (as he should), not the sort of jerky puppet that so often happens in these games. The way Batman moves across the screen, punching and kicking foes in a storm of punishment is simply breathtaking. You have a lot of different combos and actions you can take, depending on your unlocked upgrades which are bought using EXP you earn for doing nearly everything. Enemies have a symbol that appears over their heads when they are abotu to attack, in reaction to this you can hit a button to instantly counter that attack and keep going. There are several types of enemies, each you have to approach and deal with using different tactics. Enemies carrying riot shield will shrug off your punches, while enemies with knives will slice you up if dealt with head-on.As said before, Batman has all his gadgets available to him throughout the course of the game. His batclaw (grappling hook), Batarangs, smoke bombs/pellets, explosive gel, and even a decrypter. Most of these gadgets can interact with the environment, and you will be using them in this manner very frequently...which further adds to the feeling of you being in the Dark Knight's shoes. Most of the gadgets can also be used in combat to disorient or stun foes. My only complaint is that every encounter is a picnic. You can easily take down 10-12 foes in a small, confined space without any of them laying a finger on you.Graphics==========This game is simply stunning, graphics-wise. Even today it still stands up next to newer games being released. The amount of detail that went into just about everything you see on screen is amazingly sharp, very well-rendered, and crisp. Arkham isn’t just dreary, but classic gothic horror dreary. Batman glides with the ease of an athlete, with his the cape swaying with his paces. You can see characters breathing, which is always a nice touch in my opinion. As the game progresses, Batman's suit actually begins to look more and more beatup/tattered after so many battles. Every character, whether hero, villian, or supporting role, has a very defined look. The best one by far is the Joker, and why not? He is literally the star of this game.Sound and Music==========One of the best things about Arkham Asylum (and most of the subsequent titles) is that almost every character is voiced by their Batman: The Animated Series voice actors. This means that Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker!) is reprising his role as the Joker, and my god does he nail it! I cannot picture anyone else ever voicing the part of the Joker as well as Mark Hamill does. Batman is voiced by Kevin Conroy, who has played this role/voice since 1993, in nearly every animated feature and video game with Batman in it thereafter. This includes the Justice League and Batman: The Animated Series. Their inclusion makes this game feel authentic, and lends to it a nice atmosphere.The accompanying music to every scene in this game is very dark and fitting. You definitely feel like you are in Batman's world. It's the usual dramatic Batman fare, which sets the tone of each area and encounter. Performance==========Initially, the game ran beautifully. Not a problem whatsoever. But the longer I played, the more I started noticing a short 0.5 - 1 second stutter that only occured every 20-30 minutes. It did not affect my enjoyment of the game, nor did it hinder me at any point, but it was noticeable. Aside from that small irk....there were no other issues with this game during my 31 logged hours. It ran at a near perfect 59-60 FPS at all times.Final Thoughts==========Batman: Arkham Asylum is very nearly the perfect game. This game is as close to 100% as I’ve ever seen. It's damn close to a masterpiece. It's a game everyone should play at least once, especially if you are a fan of the Dark Knight. Your collection would just not be complete without it. Likely an entire generation will go by and never find a better gaming dollar spent. Gameplay Demo==========

Fantastically satisfying & well-designed // Recommended even for those who don't care for the Batman franchise+ Voice-acting is spectacular; dialogue stays true to the lore, and lines are competently delivered (with the notable exception being Gordon's character)+ Combat system is simple, fluid and enjoyable; attacks are well-rendered, feel as though they have weight to them, and offer the player an opportunity for great finesse+ Detective mode is an excellent mechanic, and adds significantly to gameplay+ Myriad unlockables and collectibles scattered throughout; character bios, therapy audio files, riddler trophies, etc. are all fun to collect and do well to showcase the lore of the franchise+ Mechanics are refreshingly varied and intuitively introduced; the way that Batman's utilities work to influence the environment is applaudable in its implementation+ Devs showed great care in the nuances of design; Batman's suit shows gradual accumulation of wear and damage, and his beard shows visible signs of growth as the story progresses+ Platforming mechanics are near perfect, and the game does much to encourage their utilization; problems can often be tackled in many different ways depending on how the environment is utilized+ Audio design is superb+ Boss fights require a healthy balance of reflex and making on-the-spot decisions+ Environmental detail is excellent; the devs clearly took great care in modelling the island, and the quality really comes through in the final product+ Game's engine runs smoothly and efficiently- Facial animations are atrocious- Abysmal variation in enemy mob design; game relies heavily on a copy/paste approach- Very poor variety in voiceovers for secondary characters and enemy mobs; it seems as though all support characters are voiced by 3 or 4 individuals- Textures have not aged well, and contrast sharply with quality in lighting- Standard enemy mobs have one, solitary KO animation; this animation is used uniformly throughout the entire game, and it is a decidedly ugly one at thatLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

Without him, this game is nothing. He is completely insane. For me it's the best character ever made.If you're a true fan of the Batman: Arkham series, this game is for you.Welcome to the Madhouse.9/10			"

												OK, So before I even talk I'm going to warn you, this is a hard review for me to write. Don't get me wrong I LOVE this game but I have trouble explaining HOW it is so good. Especially since now I've start Arkham City and that seems completely different but better. Anyway let's get started, shall we :D (Corrine VS Pin)First thing first, The game looks SO good for it's time. It actually definitely holds up to today's standards. The controls for this game are perfect and I acually MUCH prefer a keyboard over a controller. Into the gameplay, the game's unique fighting system is really nice! it isn't perfect but the idea is great. You can see that in Arkham City they had the budget to polish the fighting system but here it is still good. The only imperfections within the fighting system are just things such as not being able to counter straight after a takedown/attack. This just slows down the gameplay and doesn't make it feel very smooth (Arkham City fixes this though :D). Another gameplay feature that I love is the gliding! Oh how I love gliding around. And the Stealth sections also!!! Love it, Love it, Love it! It is very fun to BE the dark knight and takedown people like a total badass :D The gadgets are also what makes this game so great and unique.Other great gameplay features worth mentioning is the detective mode, the riddles and the riddler trophies! All great feature that just really make this game all the more unique and absolutely AWESOME!Onto the setting, the entire game is set on the Arkham Asylum. For some people this may seem repetitive but for me I love it! The mood and atmosphere of the island the the constant 'announcements' made by Joker make this feel ALOT like Bioshock's atmosphere however imo it's WAY better than Bioshock's world and atmosphere (Bioshock fanboys INCOMING!). The map is used great for evey scenario and I love the many hidden riddler trophies in every corner of the map. The characters in this game are AWESOME! I LOVE the Joker and the BATMAN! The voice actors for both were so perfect. Honestly I've never liked any of the film batman's (that was my only knowledge of batman as a kid) but this Batman is the perfect batman!!! The Joker is also the TRUE JOKER! I personally still prefer Heeath ledger's joker but I like that more as a realistic Joker. THIS, THIS IS THE ORIGINAL! Love it! Another great charcter that had some of my fav moments in the game were the Scarecrow scene.Onto the story :D How do I explain the story in this game?... Well, this at first seemed like one of those mvies that are good because of everything on screen but the story wasn't that great. AT FIRST it seemed like that, however now I realise this story is actually REALLY GOOD for a start up Batman game series. There are no plot twist like I said but still, the scenes with Killer Croc and Scarecrow are amazing! This kind of leads me into the boss battles. This game had a lot of good ones and a few bad ones. To start off, as long as you've actually completed one single game before, you should set the game to 'Hard' difficulty at the beginning. I didn't do this but I should've since the game is really easy and it also saves a LOT of time when gathering achievements. Ok so now onto the boss battles. First I will talk about the good ones which inlcude the Bane boss battle, Poison Ivy boss battle and of course the Killer Croc boss battle. In my opinion the Killer Croc boss battle was the best but the Poison I vy boss battle was the hardest. The Bane boss battle was ok but there were MANY more boss battles that used the exact same mechanic which got old and boring quickly. This leads me to the bad boss battles which mainly include all of the Titan X bosses and the final Joker boss. As I said the Titan X bosses got boring but the Joker boss battle was a huge let down as it was so EASY! I FINISHED IT ON MY FIRST GO!!! That is not something to be boasting about because it is actually quite disappointing :( I was expecting more but it was so... simple :((((Overall, the great graphics, characters, area, atmosphere, story and overall great gameplay makes this game a true masterpiece that will NOT be forgotten. It really makes you feel like the dark knight and the completely unique gameplay give you so much control :D 8.5/10  To one of my fav games ever :DPros:-Story-Gameplay-The Unique-ness of EVERYTHING!-The characters-The Asylum setting and the atmosphere-The riddler trophies and plethora of bonus content-The immersion-The enjoyment you get from playing!!!Cons:-The fighting system, while good, isn't perfectly smooth-The final boss battle is easy and the Titan X bosses are boring and repetitiveOh, and if you would like some free game keys, join our group (I'm a mod): Accidently Reviewed  Was this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

												Look in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane... it's super... wait no, wrong Super Hero...  Although one thing is true, this game is super.  For years we video gamers have asked for a super hero game that wasn't a garbage movie tie in or flat out horrible platformer.   WB and Rocksteady games did just that with the Arkham series of games.  Starting with the BD... that didn't sound right I meant Big Daddy known as Arkham Asylum..Everything about this game just works, the combat is fun and challenging for the most part, While not the most overly difficult combat system ever created, if you don't stay on your toes you can be easily overwhelmed.  Although by now this type of combat system has been used numerous times and perfected in other games, like the sequels to this game and Sleeping Dogs, it was flat out amazing and new when the game came out.The story seems ripped right from a comic book.....   Batman has captured the Joker and is hand delivering him to Arkham Asylum, on the way you get some awesome views of the batmobile and Arkham City, the setting for the follow up game..  Once inside the master villain joker puts his plan into full effect.  I could go into more detail but trust me it's pretty amazing.I would recommend this game to fans of Batman, fans of beat em up's, and generally anyone that enjoys good video games.... This is flat out a good video game.  You'll enjoy it, money back guarantee...  (if you want your money back though... don't ask me, cause I'm not giving it... this game is a masterpiece)			"

												Smaller and more intimate than any of its successors, Arkham Asylum thrives on its story, atmosphere and punchy free-flow gameplay. While missing the blatant heroics of Arkham City and Knight (and Origins), Asylum uses its smaller scope to provide a plethora of intricate details that would be lost in a larger game. A video-gaming classic.Total size on my hard drive: 8 GB++ No more Games For Windows Live (GFWL). It is gone. + Though older now, Arkham Asylum still looks great (Unreal 3). And, being older, it’s fairly easy to crank up the fancy settings.+ Great voice-acting. Many major characters from Batman: The Animated Series are here, headlined by Hamill and Conroy, and includes Arleen Sorkin’s only appearance in the Batman games as Harley Quinn (Sorkin was replaced by Tara Strong for Arkham City and later installments).+ Great soundtrack. Not as heroic as Arkham City’s, but darker and more moody.+ Great atmosphere. Reeks of macabre gloom.+ A large gallery of rogues in spite of being the smallest Arkham game (Poison Ivy, Scarecrow, Bane, Joker, Zsasz and others).+ The first iteration of the rhythmic Arkham combat is very satisfying, though with fewer gadgets and special moves compared to later games.+ Packed with trivia and collectibles. Be sure to randomly scan with X-ray vision every now and then; you never know what you might discover. Refreshing to have some that are NOT Riddler-related.+/- Decent story. Once the Joker takes over, the momentum doesn’t slow until the end of the game. A few things might not make sense if you think about them too much, though.+/- Many narrow corridors make some levels feel very restricted.+/- Can be confusing to navigate. Sometimes you’re supposed to turn around and backtrack, but nothing tells you to do so. +/- Challenge maps are indeed challenging, but there aren’t as many as in later games. Still great for practicing the combat.- Backtracking. There is a lot of it. Clear an area, proceed on, get a new gadget, go back and – whoops, there are new thugs in the room, time to clear it again.- In what becomes a recurring theme in the Arkham games (except Origins, which was created by a different studio), boss battles are lack-luster. Usually they involve a horde-mode of some kind; others require spamming batarangs and dodging.- The final boss fight happens from a locked camera perspective. Not sure who thought that was a good idea.Arkham Asylum is easily the game that will be remembered for redefining Batman in the genre. While later games in the franchise scale great heights of impossible heroism, it’s Arkham Asylum that remains the preferred choice if you just want to “chill with Batman” without the fate of all of Gotham (and perhaps the world) hanging in the balance.

												This is an extended review on Batman: Arkham Asylum.Content: 9/10A 10+ hours campaign story along with a great challenge mode, which also has DLC challenges included, that can extend the length of the game up to 30 hours or even more in some cases. Unlockable character bios which include character interviews that you can listen to and character trophies, all of which are rewarded to you for your play time or geekness for searching and finding the Riddler's trophies. Very nice. Worth mentioning is that the game features a ""Game +"" which can extend the game's play value and play time by a lot more. (for those who are daring enough to endure the harder combat and lots of deaths that will follow)Graphics: 9/10Except from the eventual low res textures, which are hidden very well that in some cases are not even noticeable, the game looks amazing even to this day when maxed out. And this is a console port, which shows that the developers gave the time and effort to make it look as good as it could on a powerful enough machine.Aesthetics: 10/10This game catches the nitty gritty and dark enviroment, in which the Dark Knight fights villains for the good of Gotham. The Arkham Asylum really feels like a psychiatric prison that went wrong!  Not much more can be said.Sound: 9/10- Sound Quality: It is excelent, crisp and clean as it should be in any game.- Soundtrack: Be it on scenes, menus, combat or non-combat it fits the spirit of the game and that's what matters. It is great, it feel like soundtrack for a Batman licenced product.- Lip synching: While it is really good it feels like it could be better. One of the better lip synching i have seen in a game though.PC Port: 9/10- Display Settings: From Anti-Aliasing, Dynamic Shadows and Distortion to Harmonic Lighting, Ambient Occlusion and PhysX, this game has a lot of settings that will satisfy the PC enthusiants just fine. (Although the FOV slider is missing. I know, its not a FPS game but still, its not there. you can mess with the files though and set it to your liking)- Controls: This game supports controllers and rebindable keys which is a god send! Only 2 problems, 1 minor, 1 big. 1) You cannot rebind your keys while in-game, you have to do it before you launch the game via the game launcher and, 2) As many console to PC ported games tend to do, there are actions, many of them in fact, that are binded to a single key and that can cause some problems and a lot of frustration. Be aware.- Optimization: This game has been tested and completed using an Nvidia GeForce GTX 570 Sonic Edition. With Motion blur being turned off (cause my eyes hate it) and Bloom being turned off (cause apparently my card hates it), this game was being maxed out on 1080p 60 fps (with V-Sync turned on). Greatly optimized in my opinion.Story: 10/10You are Batman, escorting the Joker, an unpredictable and very dangerous villain to a psychiatric high security hospital-prison called the ""Arkham Asylum"", where he escapes, and its up to you to stop him, the prison break he just caused and the other ""super-villains"" that are lurking free in the asylum.Gameplay: 9/10While simplistic in its design, Batman: Arkham Asylum's gameplay is so good and successful that it already has spawned a mechanical clone (namely the Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor game) and probably many more will follow. - Combat: The combat in theory is an action beat-them-up with counter moves and special moves that can be executed when you have reached a big enough combo on the press of a button, but it is so much more in praticality, making the game the opposite of a chore. Satisfaction is the word that can describe it. And of course you can make Batman learn new moves and combos while leveling up, making the combat even better while you progress through the game.- Non-Combat: When there are no enemies to fight, the game includes a lot of puzzles to solve (the Riddler's trophies) but most of them are no big deal (key word being ""most"" of them). Use the batclaw to traverse through the island or just use your feet!- Present in both combat and non-combat is the dedective mode, which helps you solve riddles or progress the storyline in some cases in non-combat and helps you indentify the weakness of special enemies or super-villain encounters/bosses in combat. Also, the Bat-gadgets, like for example the iconic Batarang or the Batclaw, these tools are there to help you battle enemies, traverse through the island or solve Riddler's puzzles. You unlock new gadgets while progressing through the game.Although i will mention that combat has its hic-ups. There are times that Batman wont counter when you press the button or wont target the correct enemy or even wont hit an enemy because he isnt close enough when that isnt the case. There is room for improvement here.To conclude, Batman: Arkham Asylum is a shining example of how a Batman game or generally a superhero game is ought to be. Full of great content, amazing story and satisfying gameplay, this is a game that you are doing yourself a disservice if you actually havent purchased and played it yet. Full price or on a Steam Sale this game is worth your buck.My rating:- Must Buy- Strongly Recommended <<<- Recommended- Not Recommended- Definitely Not Recommended- Must Avoid			"

												Batman games are very complex games. Through interesting and very thrilling story you will experience satisfying hand-to-hand combat, stealth action, puzzle challenges and detective investigating. You will need to be strategical as you proceed the main campaign, especially in stealth parts of the game.This game is done so well, that you even don't have to know the Batman or DC universe.Pretty much everyting about Batman Arkham Asylum is great: Story, music, characters, graphics, gameplay and also the original voice over by Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy adds the real Batman atmosphere. My rank for this game: 10/10			"

												The game takes place in the island of arkham asylum, you can roam freely in the island between the missions but not much to do. - It has a straight to the point story, the main villain is Joker and along the way they introduce a lot of characters from the dc comics.- It has a fun collectibles system, left there by the riddler, they are fun and not so hard to collect they reveal stories.-Very neat graphics, the models are highly detailed and very well made, and the animations are very good.- Batman has all his gadgets and you can use this tactically in each level since you have the option to stealth finish it or just storm in and be aggressive.- The fighting system is so good, it is not about mashing  buttons, at least if you wanna have a perfect combo. but you can still just press anything because it is so simple, u'll get hit a few but you'll manage.-Sounds are good -There is side challenges so when you like the fighting system you can keep the fighting going, and others for stealth mode play			"

												Already beat this game on Xbox 360 a long time ago. Well, to be honest, I do not really have much to say about this game. It is Batman, it is one heck of an amazing game to say the least, and I really love the way the combo works in this game....easy to do combos, and visually just impressive to watch Batman beating the heck out of those bad guys, it really feels like you indeed are Batman. This is most likely the best game that is based on a comic book series (Even though I loved the Amazing Spider-Man as well, I would have to say the king of games based on comic books is the Arkham series)Even if the main character was not Batman, the game is still a decent game, meaning I am not liking this just because this is Batman.I really don't know what else to say....other than the fact that this is simply a ""real"" videogame. A very enjoyable one that is.If you are a fan of Batman, or the Joker, and love to play some of the masterpieces out there, then this game is for you. In my opinion, this is one of the best games of the current generation.10 out of 10.			"

												It would be too easy to talk about Batman: Arkham Asylum in terms of the licensed game you do not expect, more beautiful than you believed and that should serve as a point of reference for productions of this type. It would be easy and would also be unfair, because that Batman does not even look like a security license, but a bell'action game, which capitalizes on the best ideas of the cornerstones of the genre, putting a cure and a completeness that is rarely achieved. At the same time, all the quotations, the way in which it was included the pivotal events of the life of man bat and how they have been represented some of the most charismatic enemies will delight fans of the comic, because the love Batman, who created this game, there is the entrance to the last meander of Arkham Asylum where you must venture.

												Just finished this game and I admit it made me understand why the ""Arkham"" series of Batman games is so popular. The game has very nice and well-balanced mix of combat, puzzle solving and platforming. Lots of effort was put into all mechanics and as a result the player never gets bored with one part or another due to constant variation.  Mechanically the game is very solid and it does give you a variety of things to learn in order to be able to progress without getting too overwhelming. All new tricks are introduced at a reasonable pace and most are explained well enough (also thanks to the fact that you are immediately forced to use the new unlocked gadgets in order to progress forward). The game is not entirely open-world and gives you a number of ""hubs"" or areas to explore and act in while unlocking them one after another. This makes the experience a bit more linear than some might like. Although, once again, the level design is really good and it will make your exploration enjoyable throughout the whole title. The voice-acting is very well done and so are the cutscenes. The lore obviously adds a lot of charm to the game with lots of nice little details like interviews (voiced dialogues telling about the characters' past) and biographies to unlock and collect. The in-game graphics still look pretty good although some textures and objects do look at little bit outdated (i.e. low-resolution). Some tweaking with the usage of Steam forums might also be required in order to make the not-entirely-optimal port run at maximum resolution and with maximized visual effects even on reasonably modern systems.The story is reasonably entertaining and holds the game together well to make it interesting for the player. The main questions the game asks (as its name states) are those of sanity and madness and how one can slide from the former into the latter while also asking the player whether the criminals can be considered as ""ill"" and/or ""uncurable"". Obviously, the aesthetics of the game is somewhat grim although not without some jokes inbetween (if you like the gags Joker produces).One (non-crucial) problem consists in the fact that one can not access all in-game secrets that one detects immediately (special gadgets that unlock later are required for this). Thus I have spent some time in vain wondering whether I could not find the right approach to the secret before I gave in and Internet told me those secrets can only be accessed later on in the game.The DLCs barely add anything to the main game as they do the same thing as other in-game stealth and arena combat pieces only in new locations. So if you are dying to do more combat/stealth, they can serve as some additional fun, but otherwise they are nothing really interesting. Same goes for the challenges, which basically repeat the in-game locations for arena combat and stealth missions with slight variations (enemy composition and/or additional environmental restrictions). While all of them can serve to improve your in-game stealth and combat skills, the main game learning cruve is so nicely adjusted that it is quite enough to just play the ""Normal"" difficulty mode continuously to gradually learn and use everything that might be necessary to beat the game.Overall, if you want to start off with the first Batman game that made the whole series so famous, you will not be disappointed and enjoy your time. I heartily recommend this title. "

												When the legendary comic book hero Batman brings Joker back to Arkham Asylum for the 100th time, Joker promptly escapes and takes over the asylum. This is a 3rd person beat-em up, Metroid-vania-ish adventure with a lot of diversity. You'll go through sewers, brick buildings, a clock tower, libraries, ruins, caves, an outdoor courtyard and even the madness of the Caped Crusader's Mind. Since there is backtracking, the game will introduce new elements and paths to the backtracking, so it doesn't seem like a backtrack. New tricks, traps, situations, plant infestations and enemies will stand in your way. You never have a sense of being lost, but there is a lot of ground (and height) to explore.As you work your way all over Arkham Island, you'll be taunted by the Joker who is voiced by Luke Skywalker for those that remember the old Batman: The Animated Series. Kevin Conroy reprises his role from the series as Batman, and they're both excellent.As Batman, you've got a lot of controls here, left stick to move, right stick to control the camera, attack button, counter button, stun attack button, duck / stealth button, detective mode button, quick batterang, quick hookshot, grappling hook to climb, quick tool change, aim button, tool attack button, and finally a universal button to not only run, but holding the same button will also jump when you come to the edge, glide and its just batman auto-pilot really. You can double tap the action button to dive roll out of the way, but the times to use it are few and far between. There are more controls than buttons on the X-Box controller.You unlock several tools / weapons for Batman to use, such as batterangs, grappling hooks, explosive gel and so on. The tools for the most part can be used on the fly against enemies by double tapping the left (batterang) or right (grappler) trigger.  You can use explosive gel to set a trap for enemies or blow up walls. Its pretty nice, but its just too slow to set up, so for the most part, you'll just be punching bad guys, dive kicking from gargoyles and grapple hooking up to safety.Its fun to attack spam enemies and wipe out a dozen enemies. However, enemies with guns will murder you quickly, which is good, because then you need to rely and stealth and tactics instead of button mashing. The enemies will telegraph their attacks, so you can counter them or attack them before they do. Knife wielders will need to be stunned. The system feels good, but again its sometimes just mash 1 button as if Batman were dancing between a dozen partners. The final enemy in a group always has a slow motion knock out where you'll get to see ragdoll glitches and poor hit detection. Is it a game breaker no. Does it happen a lot? Yes and when it happens with every battle, it shouldn't have been accentuated.While there is little enemy diversity, the big appeal comes from the game's characters and situations. You'll fight against some of Batman's biggest villains that are in Arkham. The situations, you'll have to use Batman's tools and some parts the game will spoon feed you what you need to do and other parts, you're free to figure it out on your own. The map will show you where you need to go, but its up to you to get there. You'll have to go through air ducts, go high, go low and every so often go through a door like a normal person. There is a lot of traversal in this game, you're able to swoop down on enemies, glide from place to place, grappling hook up to ledges, hang from ledges, shimmy around ledges. Everything that's been done in Just Cause 2, but now its slower.As mentioned before, there is a detective mode that basically a hints mode. It will highlight air vents to crawl through, you'll be able to see through walls to enemy skeletons. You will have to use detective mode to track trails of scents and fingerprints. Detective mode will help you to find all of the Riddler trophies, which are usually in high vents. They're not hidden very well and it doesn't feel like a real reward for exploration, more like poor padding for the game.The real problem here is the canned animations, which normally I have no problem with, but in this game, I really felt the animations. Batman grapple hooking up to a gargoyle, batman pulling a vent off an air duct, batman kicking a vent out of an air duct, Batman pulling an object with the grappling hook, Batman crawling out of a pit. You'll feel it all and some of the animations, you'll need to rapidly press the action button.On top of all of that, you're unlocking a lot of extras as you progress through the game. Challenge rooms, character art and so on. There is a lot of extra content here.When you die, you're taken to an animated scene of the Joker or whatever boss you die on to hear a one liner, then sent back to the last checkpoint. That just wasn't needed and wastes time like a lot of the animation. If only there was a setting to turn it off.With all of that being said, this is still a good, fun game that compels you to play through it. The characters are bright and vibrant. It is a good story, but would it be its flaws would be accentuated more if it were not a Batman game without its cast of characters.			"

												Arkham Asylum is the first arkham game, which came out in 2009. It's a simple 3rd-person action game that introduced the best combat system for a video game that had both rhythm, fluidity, and challenge. It also introduced a stealth mechanic that made you truly feel like batman, while keeping with balance so you aren't too overpowered. The game features awesome voice work by Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, and Arleen Sorkin and a great story as well.

												In the following wake of Batman: Arkham Knight being pulled from Steam due to complications and statistics of poor performance and graphical fidelity, not to mention the ton of negative reviews pointing its fingers at a triple-A release, I decided to go back to the first game that started it all, and what an excellent adventure that this game was.Let's go down the list:[/table]GraphicsFor a game that released in 2010 the graphics are very impressive from the original to the Detective graphics. I found myself becoming immersed into the Asylum world as I used my grappling hook and glide to fly around the place and did some sightseeing. At times the objects in the distance did not seem believable and realistic, but it's pretty good for a game that doesn't need a big budget. Most of the time I really enjoyed the characters faces, especially Joker. He scared the hell out of me. For some reason Harley Quinn's face and voice did not fit; maybe I know very little about who she is. Overall, graphics were solid and excellent.StoryThe story was very good in regards to its characters and plotlines. It had me engaged throughout the entire thing and I could not wait on how it unfolded cutscene after cutscene. Even though you backtrack several times through the same areas,--and it's necessary for collectibles--it did not make me feel tired of playing the game. The last boss in the end was very good too, and although it was a bit of a cliffhanger ending I believe it had a solid conclusion.GameplayThe gameplay was where the entire game shined in its harmonious glory; ranging from its movement throughout the environment; destroying walls that lead to collectibles and secret areas; solid effective combat when fighting goons, brawlers and bosses is hell of fun; and the good ridiculous amount of collectibles to gather ranging from riddles, trophies, joker teeth, and interview tapes scattered all over the map. I usually do not play fighting games and sometimes combat and counterattacks can feel awkward at times, even grappling up to a ledge that I did not want to can be awkward, but I enjoyed all of it.OverallFor those who are huge fans of the DC universe--comics, TV shows, movies--and for those who are comfortable with third-person fighting games, investigating crime scenes, backtracking through environments to find collectibles, tolerate challenging mechanics in combat, and exploring the world of Batman then this game is for you.

 Batman Arkham Asylum Review  Having recently gone through and 100% completed this game - by completing each challenge, grabbing all the collectibles and getting all the achievements. I felt it appropriate that I review this game properly by rewriting my original review, which I was never happy with to begin with. From the beginning it's easy to fall in love with this game. The opening cinematic shows us that Joker has been up to his usual mischief in Gotham, and has been apprehended by Batman. Almost immediately afterwards, we are put into the shoes of the Dark Knight himself, as we walk with a chained up Joker through the Asylum to his cell. This scene is perfect in the way it sets the games mood, atmosphere and the tension that there is just something wrong. It also captures how great Mark Hamill's beautifully twisted Joker is, paired with the writing of Paul Dini (Batman The Animated Series, Batman Beyond), his performance is consistently brilliant throughout the game, and the opener is our first look into it. I should also mention the voice talent in the entirety of the game is fantastic, Kevin Conroy and Arleen Sorkin are especially great as Batman and Harley Quinn respectively.After the Joker is unchained and walked off to go to his cell, he escapes and we learn that he has been planning this for months, with the help of his sidekick Harley Quinn. We're then introduced to the games fast paced and fluid combat system, where you'll be battling it out with up to thirty enemies at a time. The combat can be a fair challenge at first but as you level up and make your way through the game, thirty thugs will be nothing to you. This game excels in pacing throughout and that is clear, with the way it never makes you do one thing for too long. Aside from the meaty combat system the game features stealthy sections where Batman will be put into a room of armed thugs. Considering Batman doesn't have any super powers, he isn't safe from bullets and after some exposure to them, he will fall like any man. These stealth sections, will have you picking off a number of enemies in a number of ways. You can hang them from gargoyles on the walls, you can pull them off balconies or just get up close and personal, then choke them into a peaceful slumber.Aside from hunting down criminals, you can also hunt down the games collectibles, consisting of Riddler trophy's, which are small question marks that are hidden in every nook and cranny throughout the Asylum. Or try your hand at his riddles. The beauty of Arkham Asylum's collectibles, is that they never feel tedious to collect. Collecting them will unlock concept art and character models to view from the main menu, they also tie directly into the story as collecting them all will help you capture The Riddler.Other sections of the game will require you to manually climb and jump around vertical mazes, which offer a nice break from hurting people. Pressing the X button will also put you into a handy detective mode, which allows you to see through walls to locate thugs and at some points set up crime scenes for tracking criminals down.My main problems with this game lie in the boss battles - Scarecrow and Killer Croc have fantastic encounters, with the former putting Batman into a nightmarish state which houses some very interesting sequences that flip the game on its head. However the other bosses feel very boring in comparison, the rest are like normal combat sections with a boss added, and it doesn't help that the game ends on one of these fights, which felt like a let down after around 10 hours of a near perfect experience.Even with the games small faults, the rest of the experience more than makes up for it. In total, Arkham Asylum is the current game to beat in the superhero genre. Its fantastic performances and writing make the narrative a memorable and mostly satisfying experience, with solid gameplay that makes you feel like the bone-breaking Batman.			"

												Come on...you already know right? If you didn't, this is arguably the greatest super hero game ever made. The graphics still stand up and in many cases exceed many ""triple A"" titles that are still being put out today. Even if you weren't quick enough to pick it up on the Humble Bundle (big mistake) It is still going on sale frequently for $5, and is totally worth it even at it's current full price of 19.99. Don't put it off any longer, if you have any love for the bat at all you owe it to yourself to play this game.			"

												Great game! if you never played any of the Arkham games then this is the one to start with! The game has great visuals, great combat, and a good narrative. You get a good sum of boss battles, but they're a bit too easy (In my opinion) but the thing that makes this game truly fun is the Joker. The Joker in the game is more relatable to the comics than to Christopher Nolan's version of the Joker, but the Joker is still a great villain, and it could be one of the best villains in a video game. A good thing the game does is that the game has a ton of villains, but it does not use the most popular ones (Probably to save for sequels). The villains you will see in the game are Joker, Bane, Ivy, Harley Quinn, Mr. Zsasz, Killer Croc and Scarecrow. I spent 12 hours playing this game, and it is a good length for a game like this, plus there is a reasonable amount of replay value. There are also collectables as well, Ridler trophy's, tapes from patients (villains), and unlock bios for different characters. Also there are challenges as well. The game is a true masterpiece!			"

												Batman Arkham Asylum GOTYThe first of the Batman Arkham Series and some fans consider this to be the best.The combat of the game is completely flawless when the game released & the stealth is also feels so smooth to takedown the enemies in the darkness of the night as Batman. The story of the Batman & The Joker is the classic and always is loved by the fans. Very good riddles & Secrets to discover so it will keep most busy for long.I don't know why people hate on the Batman Arkham Series it's probably the best superhero game series there is.The is game overall flawless for me I have to give it a 10/10 (I had this game on PS3 so that's why I completed that easy & got all the achievements)			"

												When I first heard about a Batman game, I immediately thought about early gaming exploits to bring Action Figures from Movies or Comics to the world of Gaming. For some reason I was under the impression it would be cartoonish, simplistic, and probably not a game I would enjoy; However, Once I sat down and started actually playing Arkham Asylum, I realized my fears of a childish rendition of Batman in game-form, was completely wrong. Batman: Arkham Asylum, reminds me of games like, Knights of the Republic meets Metal Gear 4, meets a Kick♥♥♥♥♥Batman. It had all the qualities I like in games, an array of weaponry and gadgets, puzzles, a compelling story and interesting characters, all brought to us from the Batman Universe. Complete with the villains we've come to love and/or despise, as well as an in-depth back story of the Historic Arkham Asylum, it is easy to see why this was the game of the year when it was released. If you don't have this in your inventory, you are missing out on something pretty amazing.			"

												There's not a lot to say about Batman: Arkham Asylum that hasn't yet been said.The game is wonderful, well scripted and easy to play. Enjoyable to play, I should say. It's a joy to get your hands around the controls and take control of The Dark Knight himself, battering the crap out of Arkham's worst.It took me 14 hours to do a full playthrough (with 100% completion of Riddler trophies), and afterwards I'm looking forward to setting about Arkham City. You don't need me to tell you that this game is good. Everyone else has already done a better job than I ever could. What I would say, though, is to try and 100% the Riddler trophies, the Riddler sidestory is awesome.-Nilesy			"

												Someone in a forum asked if they would still enjoy playing this game as they had already played the later Arkham games first and heard the combat mechanics in this were clunkier, so I decided to turn this into my first review. Yes, it is a little clunkier, but still enjoyable once you get into it and the overall atmosphere is still probably the best in the series. Because the world isn't as open, it's a more focused story and running around in the Asylum is often a claustrophobic, nightmarish experience. Scarecrow is actually scary here instead of the annoying, glorified Hugo Strange type character he plays in Arkham Knight. Being in the sewers with Killer Croc is still freaks me out when I've had to replay it - recommend you turn your volume up! It also has some of the coolest NVidia physx effects additions to the series if you can run them, such as interactive leaves, breaking floor tiles and stretchy cobwebs  (still haven't had any cobweb effects in any of the other games despite them being in every airduct you crawl through - it really enhances the experience).Biggest differences in fighting are the countering is much less forgiving (You can't wait a whole two seconds before you counter like the other games), evading over someone's head doesn't automatically make you untouchable and there's no sliding (I usually like to open combat with this). Also, if you were a fan of the remote batarang, forget about using it here. While it exists, piloting it is probably the last thing you want to be doing.Also, as it's the first game in the series there's a lot more instruction as you begin, whereas the later games tend to treat Arkham Asylum as the learning point for the series and instead drop you straight into the action. If you can get over all of this and liked the later games, I think you'll enjoy the game, it has a nice tone, some fun Joker commentary and feels much more intimate overall. 8/10, would play again if I lost all my achievments due to Windows Live closing down and rendering my older copy useless (B@stards).

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.If you were to ask around about people's favorite comic book hero, Batman would most likely nab the number one spot, and for good reason. He's an incredibly deep character with realistic motivations, who also happens to be kick-a$$ and has just about the greatest rogues gallery in all of the literature. His popularity is immense, with people shelling over hundreds of millions of dollars in order to catch his latest movie, not to mention the related merchandise. Yet somehow despite all this, Batman has never had much success in the gaming world, with few good games in his name amidst a sea of mediocre and sub-par creations. That is until Rocksteady came along with Arkham AsylumAbove all else, though, Arkham Asylum succeeds in inserting you into the cape and cowl like never before, allowing you to truly be Batman. And boy, does it feel good.			"

												Great gameplay and story are combined in this edition of the Batman gaming series.  The combat system is not overly hard to learn but more of a challenge to master.  I consider myself more of a casual gamer and I was able to complete the game without too much difficulty.  You play as Batman, gathering your gadgets and upgrading your skills as you go.  Fight the escapees from arkham such as Poison Ivy, Harvey Quinn, Killer Croc, Bane, Scarecrow, and the Joker to free Commissioner Gordon and restore sanity to Arkham Asylum.   There is also a side challenge of solving the Riddler's riddles and finding the clues to understand what happened with Amadeus Arkham.  You may have to go back and refind a few of these after you have acquired the right tools to gain access to them.  This is one of the few games I can say I thouroughly enjoyed and would come back to and play again after beating it.  I am not a player that usually enjoys going around and getting achieves but I found myself doing that and enjoying it as well.  I am still going for the 40 hit combo achieve.  It and several others will test your patience and skill if you are going for a perfect game.			"

I'm guessing they improved it at the sequel, but I can't comment on that, yet. Taking my time with the first installment at the momment. Want to savour the momment. The only problem, in my oppinion, is the issues some users (me included) have been having with newer CPU, GPU and operating systems regarding black screens, screen tearing, game crashing etc, but these problems can be fixed with a little tweaking of the executable game files (ShippingPC-BmGame.exe denied access by Windows comes to mind).

												Very late last night I finished this. The story is not very deep or interesting but what makes it stand out is the story-telling. The atmosphere is filled to the brim and the many collectibles do a great job at fleshing it out. I did learn a lot about the world of Batman so it was a little disappointing that so few bosses were in the game. Oh well, there's enough future games to rectify that.The combat is the right amount of challenge but it's more on the easy side. Leveling up Batman wasn't very satisfying. It's the gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign which add for nice new gameplay mechanics. Getting access to previously unreachable places makes for a nice sense of progression.While neither being a classic open-world nor traditionally linear, the mixture of both elements worked very well in the end. There is minimal backtracking unless you have an itch to complete all Riddler Challenges - which I did - but thanks to compact levels it didn't get tedious. I'm interested to see how this changes with future Batman games that went open-world.On a technical level the game holds up surprisingly well, especially with unusually good texture work. Of course there are low-poly characters, assets and unconvincing lighting at spots but given it's a game from 2010, it still looks very nice. The pre-rendered cutscenes on the other hand are of unquestionably putrid quality with at times more artifacts than video. How did this even got through. Very recommended.			"

												It's dark, it has bat-toys, it somehow manages not to kill despite pulling enemies into a crazy long fall, it is batman!Okay so this is a great game, with lots of references to batman villains. Far from all his villains, since he does have a massive gallery. Since my batman knowledge mainly comes from the cartoons, and not the comics, there were biographies for a lot I didn't know of, but there was also some missing that I really liked. But of course all the big guys are at least referenced to or make an appearance. You just can't be certain your favorite is mentioned, if you have one of the smaller villains in your top most wanted list. My personal favorite characters all made appearances though, but they are also some of the bigger names.The combat is nice and easy to control for the most part. The only parts where it really had me angry was during some of the boss battles, where the camera was locked in place... Which was really annoying, after having had full control of it during the rest of the game. While the bosses all looked cool, there was only one I liked. Since who the bosses are spoils who is in the game, I will let it be in spoilers for those you don't want to see it.The scarecrow scene was fun and unique the first time you got it. And it made sense you had less control, given you were fighting fear itself... However, come the second encounter it was already boring and just something I wanted to get over with, really frustrating. Not hard or difficult just boring since you had done it already.The whole thing in crocs lair was also more unique, but damn it was awful. Having to just throw batarangs at him once in a while when he came up, and run other times...Poison Ivy had the locked camera making her fight annoying, when it could have been nice, and same with the Joker.The only boss I actually liked fighting was Bane. The second annoying thing was the riddler trophies/challenges for collectors. Not that there was too many, even though there were a lot and many could have been removed. No, the problem was the way some were made. Instead of making sure you could find a way to reach every trophy in an area, before moving on with the story, several of them were locked behind places where you were unable to reach them without a gadget you wouldn't get way later in the story. Some of them you could even SEE sitting there taunting you going. ""Oh hell no! You have to come back here near the end of the game if you want me! Even though it will make no sense in the story to return here."" Like really? Really? There is nothing wrong with having to return to an old area later if you want to pick up stuff you might have missed, as long as it is the player's choice. But forcing them to return because you don't give them the tools to reach everything before the story pushes on, is just low. Especially taunting them with the things they can't reach... AND there was a gadget upgrade you needed to get through some stuff, that you only got the second time you returned to the minibatcave. Like WHY??? Why wouldn't you bring it along the first time we were there? It made no sense... -.- Dumb bat.But the story was fun, and beating up enemies outside of boss encounters was also a lot of fun. Flying around and surprising your foes gave you a feeling of being the fighting batman. Overall it was a really great game, which is why it is so annoying that the boss encounters and riddler stuff left me frustrated. I recommend it to any fan of batman and action games.			"

												Story (9/10):Batman: Arkham Asylum is one of the best games I have ever played. You play, as the title suggests, as *dramatic pause* Batman! Armed with many iconic gadgets like the batarang, grapple, smoke bombs, and many more, it is your mission to put a stop to the Joker's plans within the Asylum.The story is exciting, and unique. As you progress, you must adapt and master new skills as objectives become more difficult to complete. Iconic characters will make appearances as you progress. Most will try to kill you, some will try to pull a fast one and try to backstab you, still one in particular will even try to eat you. You will be in danger from start to finish, captivated by the eerie environment and developing story.Visuals (10/10):Arkham Asylum is a bit dated now, so the graphics are not considered as stunning as they once were. However, maxed out, it still looks very good. The asylum is true to its comic book origins, meaning it is dark, depressing, and gives off the feeling that something more sinister is lurking behind the walls than just the criminally insane.Gameplay (10/10):The world of Arkham Asylum is free exploration, but to stay interested and invested in the game, you can't really deviate from the story because the story is linear and without side missions to distract you. Personally, I am not bothered by this because there is quite a bit of problem solving and each area you enter presents a new challenge that require different approaches, so you aren't doing the same thing over and over.The main story is fairly long probably about 15 to 20 hours depending on the difficulty. On top of that, you have a couple of miscellaneous “missions” like doing all of the Riddler Challenges and examing the artifacts found in the Asylum. While many find these boring, I personally enjoyed going back and doing these because they offered sereral easter eggs by referencing events and characters from the comics that I enjoyed. If this isn't your kind of thing, it is easily skipped.This game is in third person, so it relies on a very effective free-flow combat system based on combos. It mixes classic fighting with silent takedowns and special combo moves that create the classic Batman that can take anyone in a fight. Included in the fighting system are the gadgets. The gadgets create a whole new host of ways to creatively finish off opponets in both direct and indirect combat. Many complain about the fact that the Batmobile and Batwing are not present in the game except for short stints, and are not even player operated. While this is unfortunate, the nature of the game taking place inside a small, finite area really defeats the use of either one. Sound (8/10):In terms of music and sound effects, Arkham Ayslum employs them to great effect. While the soundtrack isn’t really memorable, the small things like dripping water, metal clanking against metal, and other small things add to the immersion. The environmental and combat sounds are actually quite good. Unfortunately the dialogs are hit or miss, which sometimes hurts the characters.Replay value (9/10):While the plot is linear and there aren't any choices which would change the story in any way, the game provides countless hours of fun as probably the best batman simulator on the market. If the story mode gets boring, there are always the numerous challenge missions that are not part of the story that are fun to play.Conclusion (9.2/10):Batman: Arkham Asylum is a very good game, with an unforgettable setting, an engaging plot, and a loose ends that set up future games. Overall, it is definitely one of those games which you have to play at least once and I highly recommend it.			"

If your a Steam user you can find the game on sale from time to time for $7.50, its worth every penny.As one of the best Batman games that have ever been made I have enjoyed every part of the game. The visuals are amazing and it really shows the Unreal Engines capabilities. The PhysX also really bring it all to life with the dynamic fog, steam, cloth and distributable environments, Also the absolute best part is how Batman is voiced by non other then Kevin Conroy and The Joker is voiced my Mark Hamill! That's right, the ones who did the voices for the characters in the animated series and for DC Universe Online also did the voices for the Arkham series.The game doesn't have coop play but does offer a challenge mode that you can compare your score with others and try for first place, if your into that kinda thing. As for me I don't care for multiplayer modes in any games unless it offers coop play or team based challenges.The campaign (or single player mode) starts off with you taking Joker into Arkham Asylum as part of the opening cinematic. The look and feel of that is incredible and being made with the Unreal engine has allowed the developers to really bring the mood of the Batman universe alive. Throughout the game you will come across other iconic characters from the Batman universe like the Scarecrow.Through out the game there are Riddler trophies to collect and although some are easy to find, others require the use of special equipment to get to. There is a total of eight pieces of equipment that you will get as the game progresses and you will want to back track and hunt down where you can use them. I like the detective mode myself and with it you will find Riddler's questions marks around (only viewable in detective mode) and you can take a picture of them to solve the secret.If you acquire all the Riddler's trophies and question marks, destroy all of Jokers chatter teeth and solve the spirit of Arkham asylum by finding all of the Amadeus tables, then beat the game you will complete 80% of the game.The fighting in the game is excellent. Lots of various moves and combos that aren't hard to master. Your final hit on an enemy results in a slow motion cam for the it and a rag doll effect as he drops to the ground. All the fighting is non lethal as is Batman's style so no blood and gore here. However there are lots of Batman's gadgets to use and that is just super cool!Weather or not your going to wait for this game to go on sale to pick it up, its worth the price paid for it. Batman: Arkham Asylum, is worth a play!Pro'sAwesome visualsIconic charactersCharacters voicesLots to discover in the gameLots of secretsCon'sBoss battles have a recognizable patternCVGAnton's Ratingːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starː

												Where do I begin... This has to be one of the greatest licenced games and if you love Batman like me, you'll instantly have fun playing this. It really feels like you're playing a live action comic book. There have been many people that have played the Joker in the Batman movies and shows, but none of them have done it right. But Mark Hamill has to be the perfect voice actor for joker and I'd hate it if they replaced him. This game is visually stunning with very colorful and non linear level design. I think that one of my favorite times in the game are the hallucinations that you get from scarecrow. A great feature to this are the gadgets and you have to use your tools to get to certain places and advance to a higher area using your gadgets. Although it's not as big of an open world as Arkham City, you'll get over that very quickly. There is something in this game that many people will not like, is the constant running back and fourth through the areas of Arkham Island. Personally, I don't care but I could understand why some people would find it to get tedious. But the buildings change, for example is the Arkham Mansion. At first, the building looks normal, but when you come back there again. The whole building is full with plants and this pink air. The story is also very good but the boss fights might be a little too similar to eachother. The reason why is because the main enemy is always standing very up high looking down at you, ridiculing you while they send in inmates which you have to fight. And that is where I get to the combat. The combat in this game is very satisfying and you'll find yourself having a good time fighting. So if you look at this review thinking to yourself if you should buy Arkham City or this game, just buy both because they're both a must buy. Batman fan or not, you'll love this masterpiece from Rocksteady!			"

												The story in the this game is phenomenal and the combat is simple but sweet. So many game mechanics to learn and an island of Batmans villains to fight. The voice acting it great in the game and every villain is written so well. There is something to be said when the games writting is better than the current DC movies released. Even if you are not a Batman this game will turn you into one.			"

												Batman: Arkham Asylum is a great game - and, sadly, largely better than its successors, even though they are solid enough games themselves.What this game does better than anything else - ever - is make the player into Batman. You are Batman. You feel like Batman. You do Batman-type things. The story is great, the characters are great, the flow of the gameplay is great, the voice-acting is spot-on... even the collectibles in this game are good.It also does an excellent job of making use of the villains - the Riddler's riddles are actual riddles, the Scarecrow segments feel very trippy, and the Joker himself is gloriously hammy.This is one of the greatest games of all time and it would be criminal not to play it.Grade: A+			"

												I'm a little late to the party but this is a brilliant game. It's very well designed, with streamlined, fun gameplay and solid interface/controls. You can tell that a lot of thought went into its design.The mixture of tools at your disposal such as the batclaw and batarangs is very reminiscent of Zelda games, while the areas that you can't get to until you unlock or obtain new equipment is very much like Metroid.It's a perfect mix of exploration and combat. The ""two button"" combat system is simple, but compelling, and very satisfying to do.The story is great, and the voice acting is good as well.If, like me, you somehow haven't played it yet, pick it up in a sale and give it a try.

   My Playthrough   Youtube Playlist    The Review I really can't recommend this game enough. This game is one of my all time favorite games. And in my oppinon it's the best Batman videogame. This game perfectly captures both the detective side and action side of the dark knight. Everything works well in this game from the story, to the voices, and the gameplay. The story keeps all the characters constant with their comic counterparts . Getting the same voice actors from the Batman: The Animated Series was an act of genius. Mark Hamill as the Joker is one the major selling points of this game. This game plays like a 3D metroidvania game and in my oppinon is a prime example on how 3D metroidvania games should stride to be like. The only problem I had with this game is the final boss battle was very lackluster and didn't really make sense when you think about it. But the terrible final boss still doesn't stop this from being a great game.  "

												Batman Arkham Asylum is a smooth action game that mixes elements of platforming and stealth.At the beginning of the game the Joker has just been captured and is being delivered to his holding cell in Arkham Asylum. You control Batman and follow the bound Joker and his armed escorts to the detention unit. Something goes wrong and Joker is free and you need to hunt him down and foil his plot, whatever that may be.The combat is awesome. There are many ways to take down enemies. If you decide to attack them directly, you will start off with punches and kicks to build your combo count. As your combo count goes up, you are able to pull off takedowns, throws, ground and pound moves and more. If youwant a more subtle approach, there are still plenty of tactics. You can hang from a gargoyle and snatch up baddies as they pass below you, hand from a ledge and pull them over, blow up structures so it falls on their head, or simply sneak up behind them and take them out silently.There will be alot of areas that will be cut off to you at first. As you progress through the story, you will gradually gain equipment that will unlock more and more of the previously inaccessible areas. Early on in the game the Riddler will contact you and send you on a mission to hunt down trophies. These will unlock character bios, models and challenge mode missions.The game looks absolutely beautiful. The environment is incredibly rich and dark. All of the villians have been redesigned to give them a grimier and more menacing look with bulging veins and dirty scuff marks on their attire. Batman's own appearance changes as you progress through the single player campaign. He receives tears and cuts and even bleeds a little by the end.The vocie actors also did an excellent job.Batman Arkham Asylum is without a doubt, one of the greatest Batman video games ever produced. The main single player story itself is a bit short, but it offers plenty of replay value through its unlockable contents and challenge modes. Batman Arkham Asylum is a must have, not only for fans of the dark knight.Sounds 10/10Graphics 9/10Gameplay 9/10Atmosphere 10/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												What a magnificent game! Easily the best superhero game ever made. The universe of Batman is captivating, and after the fantastic Dark Knight trilogy, they could not have made ​​a better Batman game.This is a game that could be like most superhero games, repetitive and boring, but the great gameplay, combined with the storyline and the lore that was applied to the game made ​​it fascinating. I felt really encouraged to explore the game, just to find out more about the Batman universe, searching for the collectibles and solving the mysteries.The gameplay is simple and fluid, has great combat sequences that you can combine with Batman gadgets, situations that require stealth to defeat the enemies are also great and well made. The graphics and sounds are amazing, which makes even more immersant the gloomy atmosphere of Arkham, in fact, the atmosphere of the game for me was one of the most positive point, really fascinating! Another highlight is the voice acting, one of the best I've seen in any game.This is a game I couldn't recommend it more, if anyone has not played it, you're wasting time, even if you don't like Batman, it's a rare gem for this type of game.9/10			"

												I just finished this game, for the second time, and I love the Rocksteady Batman games! Arkham Asylum, unlike the others, has you fight a variety of bad guys in a secluded dark island. You know what it feels like?! It feels like a Batman game, which is amazing. The gameplay, graphics, and story are all very well-executed. I do definitely recommend this game to people who love Batman, superheroes, and DC comics. They hint at so much lore! I'm very surprised how in detail the core of the game is.Like every game, there's a con or two. Sometimes my hits and/or counters wouldn't register and it would frustrate me at times. Also, the game is extremely short. I was able to beat it in one day, with only two sittings being four hours each. Nonetheless, the game is amazing. I'm glad Rocksteady dedicated their time and money into this franchise! If you haven't already, check out the rest of the franchise. They're amazing! A well done superhero game... "

												Personal Rating: 8.5 of 10Easily, this is one of (if not) the best superhero title I've played. The performance, acting, setting, performance, stability, sound, graphics, level design and control. The game is set within Arkham Asylum and there are several facilities that you can traverse between them Batman style like gliding between higher ground or simply run around. The map design is really good as in each place tries to be different and provide different strategy to tackle your goal. You have most of the common Batman tools at your disposal and there are really well implemented.Settings are immersive, its like you can feel you are the Dark Knight when playing; you feel righteous. Don't expect too much of heavy plot like any Batman animation you see but the story and settings really keep it inretesting.Another things that I really liked is how the story unveils more and more location and you don't really feel like you have been in the same place before although the game requires you to travel to the same facilities several times.Boss fight are satisfying as different fight require different strategy and not all button mashing action only. Content wise I think it is just right and they creators does not overkill the game by dragging the story and adding unnecessary features in the game simply to prolong the gameplay time.I have zero performance issue and I do consider the graphics to be really good considering the hardware requirement.The voice actors really outdone themselves as you can feel they really immerse themself to act, not just simply reading the script.Side quests such as collectibles will take sometime to tackle them especially the riddles. It is not really that hard but finding them can be challenging. One of the best feature in this game is how the environment changes with the story. It gives you a new perspective in the game and changes the mood entirely.			"

												There have been many superhero games throughout the years.  Most of them have been sidescrolling ""beat 'em ups"" in the  vein of the Final Fight series.  Others were horrible adaptations like the Superman game for the N64.  Arkham Asylum has been, with few minor exceptions, one of the most on-point adaptations of a superhero property into a game that I have ever played.  First, the format, a 3-D ""metroidvania/Legend of Zelda"" type deal where new tools open new areas and items to get, plays nicely into the feel of the game.   That same format also helps with the ""lone hero"" feeling that is in many ways the essence of Batman.  You feel like yes, you are alone, but you aren't out of your depth.  Also, the classic animated series voices help set the tone of the game; dark with just a bit of humor here and there.The game world is lush and well rendered, created in that gritty style also befiting a game about The Bat.  Ruined sewers, secret tunnels, and crawling through airways and up walls all give this sense of being secretive, careful, and thought out.  The world you have been given to play in is tailor made to adhere to the common action/stealth tropes that exist in other Batman works.The combat and movement can be . . . halting at times.  In particular the ""hold button to run"" command, something that I thought I had seen the end of when analog sticks came to prominent use, feels forced and unintuitive.  When the combat flows, slighlty pauses on a big hit, and Batman is leaping to and fro kicking, punching and generally kicking♥♥♥♥♥ it looks good, and it feels good to be doing it, but there aren't any ways to ""do"" the one move you like, really.  And the combat system is at its best when you have maxed out all your available attack options.The fightable enemies are simple and never waver from the basic human stock of ""Joker goon fight""; they are either unarmed, armed with a melee weapon, armed with a firearm, a stun baton, or they are giant mutant freaks.  This includes the ""boss fights"", making the gameplay and world far more engaging than the actual combat.  That said, most of the combat is short and simple.  I think the longest normal skirmish took maybe a minute.  And the best parts of combat aren't specifically the combat so much as the setpieces where you have high perches to disappear to.  You can swoop down, take out a goon, and then grapple up into the shadows, listening and watching as the other goons start to freak out as you take them down one by one.And finally the story, which at least matches the quality of the old animated Batman series movies for plots.  Joker has a crazy plan, and Batman has to stop him.  The winding way Bruce has to do this is what makes up the bulk of the game.  Some of the story points feel contrived, but overall, the story flows from point to point in a logical way.  What helps in this is that Batman himself often tells the player (and Oracle over his headset) the next step.  And when Batman tells you something in this game, a combination of the voicework and the writing just seems to make the next plotpoint make sense.With solid voicework, a lonely, beautifully crafted world, and a combat and stealth system that is only sometimes marred by its own trappings, this is a solid, wonderfully made title that anyone who counts themselves as a superhero fan in general or a Batman fan in particular should own.

												Without a doubt one of the best games. Just about everyone likes Batman, but you don't even have to be a comic fan to appreciate the amount of detail and information about the Batman universe that Rocksteady crammed into this game.The story is meaty and dark, and the combat is just deep enough to always be fun without getting too frustrating. Don't be surprised if (like me) you find your interest in comics pique and you end up buying some of Batman's graphic novels after playing!A must buy, regardless of your gaming preferences.			"

												Retrospectively, Batman: Arkham Asylum is the high point of Rocksteady Studios' Batman trilogy. It's a tight, focused experience with a deft tonal awareness, shaping a dark, grotesque setting for a plot that hits all the 'edgy Batman story' notes, relying on spectacle - supplemented by some pretty top-tier action and stealth gameplay - to see it through.Similarly to the way Asylum itself is the pinnacle of the Arkham series, Arkham Asylum's third-person melee combat is quite easily the best to be found within this genre. It's fluid and functional, with solid ability variation supplemented by superb animation and sound design shaping an experience that is - at its core - quintessential to the cheesy, ridiculously one-sided combat of superhero comic books. Despite the borderline omnipotence of Batman's combat ability, the fights never became overly unchallenging, as the game introduces new enemy abilities frequently enough to keep you juggling knives, stun batons and giant experimental abominations. Regarding stealth gameplay, Arkham Asylum utilises mechanics that necessitate a predatory approach - if you're spotted by armed enemies, you'll be dead in seconds. Creeping around in the shadows and picking off burly, shirtless men until they start to panic is great fun, but it tends to be even more one-sided than the combat. It's almost as though there's too much freedom to just hang out on a rooftop with the x-ray vision constantly turned on until a specific enemy moves far enough away from the group for you to drop down and take him out, and then rinse and repeat. The endless functions of the x-ray vision makes it almost irresponsible not to keep the thing turned on, despite the fact that it replaces pretty much all textures with various shades of dark blue. The somewhat 'Mary Sue' nature of most superheroes is probably the cause of troubles like this - people would complain if Batman didn't have tons of ultra-powerful gadgets like this. Regardless, it doesn't totally ruin the game's balance, it just tends to make a lot of encounters a touch too easy.Arkham Asylum is pretty aesthetically brilliant. Voice performances by long-time Batman and Joker voice actors Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill adds an air of authenticity to the dialogue, as does top-tier animation and some genuinely creepy underground sequences. While the plot is more of the same stuff you'll find in a lot of Batman comics (Arkham Asylum is primarily based on Grant Morrison's 1989 comic Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth), it's still good stuff. Not because of the storyline itself, which is samey and tedious, but because of the amount of work put into the various villainous characters, particularly the Scarecrow, whose subplot features some pretty interesting surprises along the way. It's in the depictions of established characters that the story shines, coming close to the 'definitive versions' that the endless superhero film reboots seem to be going for. Arkham Asylum really ramps it up towards the ending with some fancy setpieces that are actually very enjoyable. In general, the game shines as a rare example of a popular IP being adapted into a video game that actually manages to gel the elements of the Batman​ franchise with what makes video games inherently fun.

												First review i've ever wrote and this game deserves it.Where do I begin...Well, first off, the story. It's pretty freaking cool. You've got some of your favourite villains running amock on Arkham Island. Yay! Plus Luke Skywalker plays the Joker. Secondly, the gameplay. The combat system is so awesome. I played Arkham City before this and i always enjoyed the combat. IT'S SO BRUTAL! Plus you really feel like Batman. The stealth sections are really cool and allow you to feel like Batman even more, taking out neighbours from every angle without them even seeing you, soooo awesome!THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL IS SO PERFECT. I was never much of a screenshotting person, but this game has got me saving over 200 screenshots, some of simply batmans costume and others of me in the middle in a boss fight (judge me, I don't care, jks i probs will).This game does not have you constantly playing combat and stealth sections. Nononono. There are changes in gameplay. The scarecrow sections are so cool, and slightly psychological and creepy. I was never a collectible person, but I've been finding the riddler trophies around the map. Once you finish the game, you will have more gadgets to find lots of them. Plus the riddler puzzles are cool, but they can be hard.I never cared about attention to detail, but this game has got me to see video games in a new light. The story is pretty long and there are challenge modes if you finish the game. I suggest getting the game of the year edition because then you unlock a challenge mode where you just continiously fight thugs. So yeah, I love this game.			"

												Said from someone who is not a huge fan of Batman, I enjoyed this game in a way I couldn't even imagine.First because there are no side missions. Damn I hate side missions.Second for the landscape. The environment is well detailed and grows up with you during the gameplay.Third of course for the story, neither too long nor short, just exact as this game is meant to be.Well, I'd have preferred a less thin Joker,♥♥♥♥♥♥man it's just walking bones!The combat system is not among my favourite, but it is in line with Batman's style: no kills.This game is worth every cent.

												There's absolutely no freaking way I will be able to be objective talking about Batman! He is my favourite super-hero! He is simply the best. And this amazing game is one of the best presents for everyone who have the same opinion) Brilliant dialogs (oh you! henchmen :) ), action, beautiful ladies and absolutely insane villians. So like Joker said: Welcome to the madhouse, Batman! I set a trap and you sprang it gloriously! Now, let's get this party started!			"

												Batman Arkham Asylum foi o início da era gloriosa do homem morcego nos jogos dessa geração. Trazendo o seu sistema de combate invejável, a sua história altamente INCRÍVEL e seus gráficos super invejados, esse jogo marcou a passagem do Batman na história dos video games. Embora seja inferior ao Arkham City, na minha opinião, Arkham Asylum também pode ser chamado de um dos melhores jogos já feitos em toda a história! Uma compra mais do que necessária a todos, principalmente para quem é fã do Batman e também fã de seus vilões marcantes, como o Coringa.No game, você é capaz de realizar várias manobras, utilizar diversas armas incríveis que o Batman possui, resolver alguns Puzzles bem pensados e realizar diversos combos em seus inimigos que ainda insistem em querer te parar. Uma coisinha que me chamou bastante atenção nesse jogo, como também no seu sucessor Arkham City, é a DELÍCIA da Harley Quinn.. Meu Deus, ela está simplesmente perfeita nos dois jogos!------------------------------~ NOTA: 9,4------------------------------			"

												As the predecessor of Batman : Arkham City, batman has less skills, combat and predator moves, but if you liked Arkham City , Arkham Origins or Arkham Knight, this game will bring you to one of batman's dark adventure.There are crazy inmates who will chew through batman's neck like the Jockey in Valve's great hit : Left 4 Dead 2, Giant mutant humans called ""Titan"", and face the power of scarecrow's nightmare illusion before the incident of Arkham City and Knightfall Protocol.There are also challenge maps and GOTY-exclusive DLCs included. No micro-transactions anymore.I recommend you to buy it at long holidays. There should be a 75% off.			"

												Story, plot, characters and riddles are pretty amazing things this game provides. Most of the game I was focused on collecting Riddle's chalenges and investigating who was imprisoned in Arkham Asylum and finding out what they had done. I was fascinated by character bios (especially Harley Quinn :D) and tapes from interviews between doctors and Gotham's most dangerous villains. I was also interested in the plot and story during the play, how Joker takes control over Asylum and unleashes human beasts one by one. Playablity is another thing, I hated boss fights, because of terrible controling of the main character, that's only thing I would criticize, but it's not that bad when you get used to it.8,5 / 10			"

												I just want to say that this is easily the best game that has ever been released that features a superhero. The story is incredible, the voice acting is phenomenal, the atmosphere is dark and beautiful and the combat system is unique and challenging. I have played the game 4 times over but didn't completed 100% in all of the different challenges but still I go back and play it every once in a while to try to beat my high scores which has been made previous game. If you like Batman, if you like games, if you like adventure, if you like incredibly crafted story, or if you are just looking for a good time, I would highly suggest this game since it is hand down the best in its class and its series.

												An all time classic that still holds up 6 years later. The gameplay in the Arkham games has changed little since its debut, although the first entry reminds me a lot of Zelda games, where progression is all about learning how to use whatever new gizmo you have recently acquired. The art style and music are amazing, and I'm still surprised by how great the graphics look. I very much doubt the recently announced console remake will look significantly better than this one on max settings.			"

												Not much can add in a review for something that had a re-release after being awarded game of the year in 2009 and a remastered version in 2016. All say is it was penned by Paul Dini who has written numerous Batman comic titles, the combat moves/flow mechanics are well done and in-game had the feel of Brian Bollands Batman the Killing Joke artwork come to life (not real life thankfully).4.5 Bat-Signals (just because towards the end foolishly missed the Party Pooper achivement :P)			"

												I thought I would never get to play this game.  I was not going to buy it because I stopped getting consoles.  When it came out on Steam I was like a kid on Christmas and it lived up to my expectations.  This game represents the best of Batman.  Great story and visuals and graphics that hold up well even a full console later.  Plays well, excellent controller interface but also very functional on the keyboard.  I have had no graphics or technical issues with it at all even on my older systems.For the game of the year version you get all the added content with the exclusion of the PS3 Joker missions.  I wish those had been included but not a huge loss.I recommend this for just about any action gamer out there...even if you have played newer entries its still worth playing through.  The only down side I can find to the game is it is not high on the replay value.			"

												Batman: Arkham Asylum GOTY Edition is one hell of a game. While the combat can be simplistic, it is flawless and combined with the stealth, gadgets, detective mode and all the puzzle solving really makes you feel like Batman. It presents an engaging story with quality voice acting (Mark Hamill!) and characters. Sadly, my only dislike about the game is the final boss battle as it was a little bit underwhelming. Last but not least, the atmosphere is great and the dark setting just completely immerses you in Arkham Asylum.It's also a great game for completionists as it gives you multiple things to keep you entertained. I've only played the campaign and found one or another obvious Riddler Trophy and got 66% of completion (finished it in 11,6 hours).A no-brainer for any action and/or Batman fan.➡️️Final Rating: 9/10			"

												Batman: Arkham Asylum is one of my favourite games of all time. I've played through this many times on PS3, which explains my low playtime as I already know what happens. Do I get bored of doing everything all over again? Nope. An interesting story, the best melee combat system in gaming, a stealth system with high variety, backtracking that dosen't feel boring and tons of lore and easter eggs are just some reasons why this game is amazing. This is the game that began the ""Freeflow"" combat trend in many recent releases, but none of them have matched up to the original. It's smooth, requires skill and not button mashing, and rewards people who can get into those high hit streaks. The stealth is great too. Multiple ways to take down and lure your enemies with some smart A.I to back it up. It may not seem hard at first, but it does get pretty challenging later on.There are also challenge maps that require you to get a certain amount of points with the freeflow system or perform certain takedowns with the stealth system. Extreme versions of these maps offer an even harder challenge with some unique takedown requisites.However, while the PC port is great, it is missing the Joker Challenge Maps which are exclusive to the PS3 and Mac versions of the game. If you have either of these, pick that version up instead as he is a very fun character to play as.The original freeflow game that began one of the best franchises in gaming still holds up to this day. Play it whether you are a Batman superfan or you have no idea what he is. Overall: 10/10.			"

												Second only to its successor, this game is the ultimate Batman medium. Forget about those movies, if you want a true Batman comic atmosphere - this is your stop. But you dont really need to be a Batman fan to enjoy in this great game.I've never heard about Rocksteady before this game, so I was a bit sceptic regarding previous Batman games, and also movies. Every fool can twist the famous Dark Knight to his will... And then - a mirracle. THE Holy Grail which we were searching for. Everything in this game - gameplay, story, character and level design can be described with a single word - genius. Absolutelly genius.Game starts with Batman returning Joker where he belongs - with other villains in the Arkham Asylum. But soon he falls into his trap, and the whole island is being under siege, as Batman has to uncover its secrets and mysterious reasons of Joker's (willing) return to the Asylum. Open world gameplay, and various characters to deal with, as more and more sections of the Asylum unlocks with your progress (including gadgets).After epic campaign you can play challenge maps which you unlock by solving Riddler's secrets in the campaign. From beating miscreants and breaking their bones, and doing the same in a bit different manner in predator maps. Its always fun listening thugs panicking progressively as more and more of them ends up knocked out in the shadows, or Joker mocking them for their failures.Either way, all recommendations from me.

 Batman: Arkham Asylum I'm not a big fan of DC Universe, well the whole superhero series but I do enjoy watching the movies or playing the videogames. In this case we'll discuss about Batman: Arkham Asylum, the debut of the videogame series about our favorite bat, done by Rocksteady Studios. This game is in some sort the prototype that shaped the whole action genre in all these years. So this means it is a well done game. The game feels in all it's aspects a truly enjoyable gem, maybe unpolished but it remains indeed a gem.Pros:+ The action doesn't feel too clumsy+ Being Batman feels very authentic+ The design of the city is well handled+ The script isn't what we remember about the game but it surely isn't bad+ Our hero has a wide range of tools to fight the bad guys+ The game in PC is way better than console providing the game with better graphics+ The detective mode is a nice add-on and it is easy to use+ The game lasts approximately 10 hours, which isn't as bad+ In PC you can find this game very cheap+ The audio and the immersion are very polishedMediocre:~ Stealth actions aren't as rewarding as we could think~ The game may be too easy at lower difficulties  Cons:- The combat system seems a rip-off of the Assasin's Creed franchise- The combat combos are too easy you don't feel like you are doing them- If you want to clear the game fast you may be disappointed with the duration of the title Overall score:   9,1/10			"

												Batman Arkham Asylum is a product of absolute value that can count on a cast of colorful characters to build a great game, really fun. The greatest strengths of the production lie in the gameplay built around what are the real capabilities of Batman, mixing action and stealth section, but always related with the universe from which have been extrapolated. Rocksteady's game is certainly the new standard for understanding how produce games under license, adapting for gaming the very spirit of this historic character.It's far from perfect, but still a damn good rollick through DC's well carved territory.If the combat has been a bit more sophisticated in the latter stages of the game, it'd have been a nailed-on Classic.

												With the final chapter of Rocksteady's Batman: Arkham Trilogy out, Batman: Arkham Knight, I thought i should give my thoughts on the Arkham Games that I own on Steam. First Off, Batman: Arkham Asylum. Arkham Asylum is a very fun game with a very interesting story. This game follows Batman, who has just taken Joker to the infamous Arkham Asylum compound. The Joker takes control of the Asylum when he has killed the guards with him. Batman must face iconic Batman villains such as Harley Quinn, Bane, Scarecrow, Riddler, and more. The freeflow combat that everyone loves is in this game, but isnt as fleshed out as I wanted it to be. Many more things needed to be added to make the Arkham Experience the best it could be from the get-go. The predator rooms are very fun and challenging. And of course, The boss battles. Some of the boss battles are't that great like Joker and Bane, but some of them are some of the most creative boss battles out there like Killer Croc and Scarecrow. Overall, Batman: Arkham Asylum was a pleasant suprise in 2009 (a time when superhero games sucked). I very much recommend this game, Batman fan or not.			"

												Well what can I say?!In the midst of the unfortunate reception of Arkham Knight, I thought I would tread the path of the first two games in the Arkham series...I have to be completely honest with you - never has a game gripped me, annoyed me, thrilled me and excited me as much as Arkham Asylum - you're probably wondering 'Why annoyed?!' .... well, parts of the game are difficult, namely one boss battle I won't spoil for those who haven't played, but that... EXACTLY that is what makes the game fantastic, I believe - To be the world's greated detective takes a lot more than brute force, although that does the trick in several cases ;)Nonetheless, GO AND GET ARKHAM ASYLUM and ENJOY!

Batman: Arkham AsylumI have over 80 hours on this game (Used to own hardcopy on GFLW before Steam)I was never a big fan of Batman. I never was able to take it seriously always seemed a bit lame like Spiderman or Superman is to me. This was odd to me as I always like the ""darker"" more vigialante based ""superheores"" like the Punisher etc.After getting dragged to the cinema in 2008 against my will to see ""The Dark Knight"" I changed my mind. Chris Nolan really changed Batman and brought out its really dark gritty realistic side. So obviously then I watched ""Batman Begins"" and started looking at older batman stuff.When the annoucment of Arkham Asylum came in 2009 I had my interest tweaked again. I bought it on release day as a hard copy back when GFWL was a thing. I completed the game twice, once on medium then on hard. I then completed the GOTY edition of it on GFWL bar all the challenges.I am now on my 4th and final playthrough now on Steam. Despite owning Arkham City and Origins I have not played them yet.I have only played Arkham Asylum since 09! That should indicate how much I love this game. I would recommend it to anyone who loves Batman or maybe to those who are just casual fans of the movies. This is an excellent action adventure game with a dark story and my favourite Joker portrayed by Mark Hamill.I will 100% soon and then I will finally start Arkham City, its been waiting for me for a long time :DFreerider-Dave "

												There was an animated TV series in the early '90s called Batman: The Animated Series. It had a rather unique visual style that was later on dubbed as ""Dark Deco"" and was praised for being able to represent Gotham City as it is in the Batman comic books: a dark, Gothic-like place. Visual design was done via paintings and not really CGI and it was truly remarkable; it had a film noir-esque approach, as well. Mark Hamill (the guy who played Luke Skywalker) was the voice-actor for Joker and he did a very good job - Joker's laughter gave viewers the creeps.So, what Rocksteady did back in 2009 was that they took a bunch of actors working on this TV show almost two decades before and they brought them on board. All the main characters are voiced by the same people and the game's visual design is reminiscent of the cartoon. The music, the voice-acting, the sound effects, everything is top-notch in this game.Gameplay-wise Arkham Asylum is stunning: Batman can run, jump, glide, crouch and easily can get atop buildings by using his special gadget called the grapple gun. To be honest, beside the Assassins Creed franchise this is the 2nd one where your character is as fluid as it can get and controlling Batman feels just cool. In addition to this, fighting Joker's thugs seems equally easy and smooth: you go around hitting bad guys and occasionally you are prompted to counter the attack of an enemy. If you do this your so-called flow is not interrupted and you can go ahead hitting more bad guys thereby reaching a higher score which is eventually transformed into experience points. After a while you can level-up and unlock further abilities or upgrades to your gadgets.Gadgets! Oh yes! You have the Batarang and its various versions, you have an explosive gel which can be used to destroy weaker structures / walls and you have other cool stuff, as well. You need these gadgets to get into certain places to pick up the hundreds of collectibles found throughout the island. I like that throughout the story Batman gets stronger and better gradually which also means there are more difficult enemies you encounter (whose movements are more difficult to counter or you simply need to jump in order to avoid being hit).Detective Vision: You turn this on and you see everything in blue with certain objects highlighted in orange (objects and enemies you can interact with). It's almost like the Eagle Vision in the Assassins Creed franchise. This is a must for the predator challenges. Predator challenges take place in greater rooms indoors and you are required to take down enemies silently. If they see you they'll use their machine guns and even Batman can be riddled with bullets! You always have vantage points in these places (e.g. gargoyle statues on top of the walls) that act as safe havens - you can hide in these places and carefully plan your next move. You can attack from below: you can hide in vents or under grates and suddenly jump out of these places taking down your foes.Challenges: Further arcade challenges await you; you can play FreeFlow combats as well as Predator challenges and earn medals. I believe the GOTY Edition even adds some extra places to test your skills so the playtime with this game is around 40-50 hours at least!Rocksteady has done an amazing job with the Batman franchise! It should also be noted that this game is the first in a trilogy Rocksteady has been working on. While they are working on the 3rd and final installment labelled Arkham Knight a company called Splash released a prequel episode called Arkham Origins. I am currently playing this one and fully satisfied with it.All episodes are highly recommended and they are well worth their money even if not discounted.			"

												The first thing that really stood out to me about Arkham Asylum was just how polished the game is.I'm serious, everything from the combat, to the detective mode, to the non-linear map design just screams ""tested to perfection"". It feels like the developers deliberately went into this game attempting to make a licensed title that didn't suck. And went above and beyond the call of duty inorder to do so.The premise of Arkham Asylum is the Joker has taken over and you need to go up against all the classic Batman villains inorder to eventually defeat your arch nemesis. What makes this game stand out, especially compared to other licensed titles is it's non-linearity. The asylum is riddled with alternate passages, secret areas, and numerous collectables alongside RPG elements. It generally feels like a lot of love went into this game, and if you fold the blade over 100 times the final result is one of the most innovative and polished titles out there.			"

												I think Arkham City is a more complete game, but this is a close second. It's where it all started, and holds up incredibly well. Beyond the other Arkham games and Shadow of Mordor, the Freeflow(TM) combat hasn't been used a lot in other games so it doesn't feel like an old, tired mechanism. If you're fresh off of City, Origins, or Knight (or just have those mechanics burned into your psyche) then you will notice some missing moves, but it's a brilliant starting point with a great story and if you haven't played it I don't know what you're waiting for.

												What can I say? It's the definitive Batman game and possibly one of the best comic book games ever made.The writing is top-notch, and the fact they got a lot of the VAs and writers from TAS (largely considered one of the best adaptions of Batman ever made, animated or otherwise) really makes it feel like what TAS would've been if it had the freedom of a PG-13 rating instead of being limited to a hard G-Rating (or PG in the case of movies like Mask of the Phantasm.). The background stuff like the interview tapes and hidden messages from The Ghost of Arkham we're also great. This is one of the few games I felt compelled to gather all the other stuff in.The gameplay is fluid and really captures the badass feeling playing Batman should entitle and gives you room to either be stealthy or go in swinging and fight everyone head-on with combat that feels satisfying and meaty due to the way the enemies react to hits and accompanying sounds of blows connecting and bones cracking.The graphics and art-design are great and it runs at a near flawless and consistant 1080p/60FPS on my 750ti. I say near-flawless because there's one huge problem:The implentmation of PhysX is horrid and the few areas that make heavy use of it suffer from severe FPS drops if you have it turned on.The only two flaws I can really list aside from that tech failure (which is minor since there's only like three short levels it effects) are the somewhat lack-luster boss fights and the weird save-system that only really triggers when you go through a door seperating areas.

												Batman AA is one of my all time favourite games. The love and respect that Rocksteady have shown to the DC franchise is legendary. This game oozes Batman lore at every turn with the Riddler's collectibles unlocking extras to read. Core characters are realised superbly, with the visuals complemented by the standout voice work of Kevin Conroy as Batman and Mark Hamill as Joker, both reprising their roles from the Batman animated TV series. Combat is fast and kinetic and gives a satisfying sense of Batman's power. An unlock system gives even more combat options and gadgets. The story is enjoyable and the Riddler collectibles are a fun distraction to pursue. The game is rounded out with a few combat and stealth standalone challenges.This is an easy game, even on the Hardest difficulty only a couple of spots present a challenge. It's a pretty easy 100% for achievement hunters. There is no Games For Windows Live in this version, which was perhaps its biggest fault previously. With that removed, I can't fault this game, it's 11/10 for me. Play it.			"

												B:AA is the quintessential Batman game.  It provides a brilliant pulse-racing experience from start to end taking you on a unique journey that encompasses fast-pased action, gripping adventure, interesting puzzle solving, topped off with a dash of character development as you gain experience, allowing you to upgrade Bruce Waynes alter ego as you play.Visuals, audio and soundtrack are second to none.  They alone immerse you into a video game version of the movies.  Combat is satisfying and varied enough to allow you to choose how you want to defeat your opponents.  Level design is amazing in its variety and re-use as you visit and re-visit area of the island to complete what is a decent sized campaign.  Longevity is provided through unlockable arena challenges and replaying on harder difficulties.While the vast number of Riddler puzzles make exploring a really joy.  Best of all are the final area boss encounters that test your skills with every subsequent match-up.  Make no mistake if you ever wondered what it is to take on the persona of the Dark Knight you must get this game.  One of the best allround games ever created (as Ive yet to play the sequels!)			"

												Batman: Arkham Asylum is a good game. It is the first ""real"" Batman game: you actually feel like The Bat, have his gadgets, and have a small world to explore. The plot is good, with villains popping up every hour but Joker staying the mastermind of them all. The graphics and gameplay are excellent. Sleeping Dogs has the exact same combat system (I like that one better, but this is the original). Arkham Asylum's combat system has a great free-flow feel, where you hit and block, and then you do a backflip and hit someone else, etc., but my main concern was that when I pressed the right mouse button when an enemy was attacking, Batman sometimes would not block. This got annoying and frustrating in the later missions, especially when Batman's decision not to block made you have to replay a section. Arkham Asylum has both stealth and action: stealth where you hide on top of gargoyles (almost every time) and take out the inmates one by one, and action where you take down five, ten, or even twenty of them. The map is big(Arkham City's map is much better though), but after you beat the campaign the world gets boring. Boss fights were often fun, but also often tedious and frustrating. Some of them are hard to understand if you do not read the hints- so do. The stun and knife inmates are pains in the butt just like in Arkham City, but with luck you can defeat them. The music is good, and there are unlockable challenges and trophies that look like statues. If you have time, play Arkham City and Asylum. If you don't, just play Arkham City because it's a much better game.			"

												Batman: Arkham Asylum gets so many positive reviews for a reason. If you want to know why people like it so much, well, the combat system really is as amazing as it gets, the stages that involved sneaking around were extremely fun and intense and the general atmosphere of the game is done just right. If you like games that you can get 100% in without doing extremely tough tasks but getting collectibles instead, well, you won't feel disappointed. The game is set on the Arkham island, which, although smaller and less awesome than the one in Arkham City, does not disappoint at all and has many interesting secrets. I didn't think the story was anything that this game could be praised about, but it was not bad and once in a while you'll also get a nice dose of trippy sh*t from scarecrow sequences.The only thing I really didn't like was the boss fights, which were below average but still not horrible and this does not outweight the good parts of the game. Possibly the biggest disappointment was the final boss. The clever and tricky villain was just turned into another one of those big guys and most of the battle was just fighting with his minions.If you don't like comics or batman, I still reccomend playing this game, cause the gameplay did not disappoint. If you're looking for a game that you can get 100% in, this will also be the right choice, as getting all the achievements takes around 30-35 hours if you're not horrible at combat like me. The game is also not hard to run, so if you're like me and you're stuck with a PC that mosly runs 2D games, get ready for some 3D fun.			"

												After finally getting the last achievement I can surely say this game is great! This game has no real weaknesses and is highly recommended to all action-adventure fans, especially to the fans of Batman!Batman: Arkham Asylum is a serious action-adventure game based on DC comics, it’s very atmospheric and story rich. Top-notch quality.Graphics are amazing. Nice design, superb models, great animation, it’s simply awesome and looks fantastic. Music is very good. It certainly helps to remain motivated while under pressure in certain combat and predator challenges. Voice acting is phenomenal – world class.As far as the 3 difficulty levels are concerned, this game is rather easily beatable even on Hard. The only significant difference is that you don’t see a counter warning. Needless to say, enemies deal more damage and your health replenishes less than in easier difficulties.Only few achievements are really hard, probably getting the 24 medals in combat challenges will be the most challenging for most people. Everything else is just a matter of time and proper preparation. Completing everything is rewarding, because you discover more details about characters and get to see highly detailed models of them in the main menu.			"

Batman: Arkham Asylum	* 9/10A game with Batman. End Of the Review... XD. Kidding, this game is one of the greatest homages to the dark knight and all of his world's characters.Batman has just captured Joker and is escorting him into Arkham. Soon after he quickly takes over the entire asylum together with other classic batman's enemies. This simple premise is the beginning of the first chapter of the great Arkham Saga. We'll be impersonating Batman in this 3rd person view action and we can go through the entire and vast complex of Arkham to stop Joker and all his collegues. Gameplay is really simple actually and allows the player to learn quickly how to fight, then fight against big numbers of thugs simultaneously while, as usual, boss fights will take very different approaches. Really noteworthy is the Scarecrow's section. However the player can also use a stealth approach, especially in certain areas where you can hold an elevated position (sit on gargoyles), hide in vent grates and slowly approach thugs to silently take them down.Just like the entire franchise, Arkham Asylum uses the Unreal Engine, that allows the view of interesting and inspired buildings, sceneries and closed ambiences.+++PROs+++ STORY. Great storytelling, great direction in cutscenes with an incredible ending that requires a sequel. GAMEPLAY. You can fight all the criminals or hide and ambush them, and use all of batman's gadget. Simply Awesome CHARACTERS. Honestly it's really cool to see the characters portrayed so good in the game. REFERENCES. Endless References, cameos and homages to batman's and DC's universe RIDDLER. The Riddler's challenges are one of the best secondary missions ever. They're just puzzles but they show you parts of the world and make lots of references to other characters.---CONs--- BINDINGS. Key Bindings in a pre-Game Window only? in 2010? Seriously?I played this game on this machine:Intel Core i7-497016Gb RAM DDR3GeForce GTX 660Windows 10 Professional x64 "

												Batman Arkham Asylum is the first in what would end up becoming a popular franchise. Its a third person action/adventure where you're tasked with stopping one of theJoker's nefarious new plans involving Arkham Asylum. It features a much darker story than saturday morning fare, more akin to the Christopher Nolan films and the comics.If you're a fan of batman already this game has everything you want: gritty story and visuals, all kinds of bat-gadgets, and satisfying hand-to-hand combat. The presentation is grim and sets a fantastic backdrop for everything that takes place. The voice acting is superb featuring many classic voice actors including Mark Hamil reprising his legendary role as the Joker. Arkham Asylum is a lengthy game looking at 12+ hours at the minimum, with lots to explore and secrets to collect. Despite all the content already available dont expect to see too many famous villains crammed into one game as the developers obviously had sequels in mind, but the villians it did give us fit into the story perfectly.>PROSFaithful to the franchiseDark and gritty visuals and presentationCombat and Puzzles are fun and hardly get boringBoss battles are varied and interestingFantastic Voice ActingGreat graphics with attention to detailHarley Quinn & Poison Ivy>CONSMinor bugs in the V1.1 ReleaseSometimes feels slightly repetitiveEnding could have been betterBottom line: A ruby the size of a tangerine.If you like batman, or if you like gritty dark superhero games, this is your game. It has everything you want and a little more. Now if you excuse me, im going to go play the sequel now. Recommended 8/10			"

												Arkham Asylum is somewhat of an ambivalent experience.  The voice acting and atmosphere in this game are simply amazing.  However, the bulk of the game--its combat--is fairly terrible in execution.  Rather than the skillfull, open-ended fighting which is present in most of the genre nowadays, Arkham Asylum's combat system is outdated and reminiscient of arcade-style fighters where you just have to enter a combination of buttons rather than utilizing controls with more freedom.

												Batman: Arkham Asylum is developed by Rocksteady Studios and published by Warner Bros. At first, I am not a huge fan of Batman or pretty much I am not a fan of comic books. Surprisingly, this is the Batman game that met its expectations for fans and comic book alike. The game sets in Arkham Asylum, playing as Bruce Wayne or Batman (state the obvious). The story starts where Batman is taking and apprehending Joker to the Asylum, causing it was a setup and controlling the asylum by Joker. I am not going to tell you much about the story, it's better to play the game to know about the story. Trust me, it's such a great Batman game to start with. The combat system is based on combo, score multipliers, dodges and counter attacks. There are gadgets to tackle obstacles throughout the story. You can upgrade your abilities by leveling up. Collectables all over the map (Riddler's Trophy, scarab wall and searching the answer for Riddler's challenge), like the backstory of Arkham Asylum, the interview tapes, the concept art and character bios to learn about their orginality.+ Pros+ Rich storyline+ Characters are obviously likeable+ Voice acting and musical score+ Freedom Open World (Kind of)+ Atmosphere and graphics of the game+ Combat system+ Extras or Collectables- Cons- Controls for Keyboard and Mouse are confusingly trickyThe verdict for this game's honest review is a must buy, like come on buy this game and you will love it every second, even if you are not a fan of Batman like myself. The story, the atmosphere, the voice acting, combat system and unlockables. You can find all of the extras after you finished the game and play some challenges. I don't find any game's technical flaws (unless I am a blind bat or not paying attention to details). I definitely recommend this game, just go buy the game.Updated: June 05 2015 @ 03:00am - removing the manga next to comic books sentence and finishing touches.			"

												Boy, what a wonder!There’s much to admire in Rocksteady’s adaptation of the caped crusader’s fight against crime. BAA is atmospheric and engrossing, and the gameplay is varied and well designed, with a good mixture of problem solving and combat. The graphics are very good; the combat animation in particular is excellent. Even the controls of the PC version are well designed, which is not something you can often say about games that require a good deal of button mashing. There’s a pretty good storyline too with some sharp dialogue, and the voice acting is strong throughout, especially Mark Hamill as the Joker. My only real gripe is the way the viewpoint changes for the boss fights. It certainly makes them more challenging but it’s also a bit frustrating and, to my mind, unnecessary. But this is an excellent, well-made game and is highly recommended.4/5			"

												I've been hearing about the Arkham series for a long time, but hadn't jumped in till now, until the WB Humble Bundle came along, I jumped on that as fast as I could.Then several weeks, I finally beat the game.Graphics : For how old of a game it is, it still looks beautiful, and runs very well, even on less powerful hardware. I'm not that much of an expert in Graphical fidelity, but I know when something looks good, and Arkham Asylum definitely looks good.Story : Perhaps the weakest part of the game. Don't get me wrong, the story isn't bad. There weren't very many layers to the story in my opinion, and I couldn't get into the story that much. However, the voice acting that went along with the story was just amazing.Gameplay : The strongest part of the game, the freeflow combat system is symply amazing and really makes you feel like a badass, you just can't get tired of beating up on thugs and similar. However, all the greatest parts of gameplay are completely lost in the boss fights. Where as the gameplay is amazing whenever your fighting thugs, the boss fights limit you greatly.Overall, the game is amazing. Definitely worth a buy.			"

												I extremely recomend this game for who want something like a Superhero game with stealth and a good story, Batman always was my favorite superhero, and this game only show me why. This game on the Arkham series was the one with best stealth stages(I still haven't played Arkham Knight )Points:-Characters: 7,5/10Except of Batman or maybe The Joker, this game don't explain a lot of the characters, since, I think this game was made for who already had some knowledge about Batman's world. But for who doesn't know a lot about Batman and his enemies(like me) the game has the biography about each important character in the game.And other important point is, the game has a lot of bosses, so, none of them has a proper apparition-Graphics: 9/10The graphics are really nice, since this game is quite old -History: 9/10The history wasn't that deep or complex, but for a superhero game, I think this is better than average . I really liked the history and I always was wondering how Batman would to stop their enemies-Enjoyment: 9/10I loved to play this game, really, the battle system is so good, the stealth parts of he game was extremely good too. Maybe the only part I don't like, at most, are the boss battles, they aren't bad but I think they are repetitive.Average score: 8,6/10 ~ I really enjoyed playing this game :)			"

												An excellent game in all aspects! I'm not a huge Batman fan, but this game was so polished that I could see myself getting into the Batman world.As the titles says you take control of batman in arkham asylum fighting againts the evil…of course I mean Joker.The story reels out with an impressive way fighting different bosses which are villains from comic books.Also our character may solve various puzzles which are Riddle’s puzzle and we can learn various things about arkham location,friends and foes.Despite that, in-game we don’t fight with all famous villains that batman has instead of that, we can learn many things for them, by solving riddles puzzles.I hope some of them appeared on arkham city.Combat system is just awesome.Attacks,heavy attacks,counter attacks and combo attacks are the base ingredients of the combat system.Trying to hit all the enemies flawlessly is a bit of challenging which is the best part of the combat.As you continue, our character unlocks new finishing moves which can instant kill an enemy we choose and after that we continue our combo in order to not get hit.The last kill is in slow motion!When you are not in combat, basically you are what really batman is….a detective searching for clues for murders and other things.In order to follow the clues, you must use some of the gadgets you have from the start or either unlocked later like the spray which explodes etc.One amazing thing is that you can press a button and instantly the camera changes and go to ‘detective mode’ in order to see clues,vents and other things which keep in secret.Batman is stealth so many times in game, we can kill secretly one by one all the villains on a location where many enemies patrolling with the right sequence.Sounds are awesome, from grapple up to the opening of cape and voice acting.Graphics the same.UE3 did a VERY good job here.After you finish the main game, either you can walk around on arkham asylum either you can solve Riddle’s puzzles.Summarizing either you are a batman fan or not you will love this game.

Characters like The Joker and Harley gave me a good laugh, whilst characters like Scarecrow and Crock gave me the chills. I finished the main story-line in about 10 hours, still quite a lot of side-activities to do. Great game, a 9/10.			"

												Boy, what a wonder!There’s much to admire in Rocksteady’s adaptation of the caped crusader’s fight against crime. BAA is atmospheric and engrossing, and the gameplay is varied and well designed, with a good mixture of problem solving and combat. The graphics are very good; the combat animation in particular is excellent. Even the controls of the PC version are well designed, which is not something you can often say about games that require a good deal of button mashing. There’s a pretty good storyline too with some sharp dialogue, and the voice acting is strong throughout, especially Mark Hamill as the Joker. My only real gripe is the way the viewpoint changes for the boss fights. It certainly makes them more challenging but it’s also a bit frustrating and, to my mind, unnecessary. But this is an excellent, well-made game and is highly recommended.4/5			"

												I've been hearing about the Arkham series for a long time, but hadn't jumped in till now, until the WB Humble Bundle came along, I jumped on that as fast as I could.Then several weeks, I finally beat the game.Graphics : For how old of a game it is, it still looks beautiful, and runs very well, even on less powerful hardware. I'm not that much of an expert in Graphical fidelity, but I know when something looks good, and Arkham Asylum definitely looks good.Story : Perhaps the weakest part of the game. Don't get me wrong, the story isn't bad. There weren't very many layers to the story in my opinion, and I couldn't get into the story that much. However, the voice acting that went along with the story was just amazing.Gameplay : The strongest part of the game, the freeflow combat system is symply amazing and really makes you feel like a badass, you just can't get tired of beating up on thugs and similar. However, all the greatest parts of gameplay are completely lost in the boss fights. Where as the gameplay is amazing whenever your fighting thugs, the boss fights limit you greatly.Overall, the game is amazing. Definitely worth a buy.			"

												I started the game some time ago now and didn't return until recently. Having lost my save i started over on easy as i wanted to move through the game pretty quick. Admittedly easy was a mistake i should have switched to normal again as i had lost some of the challenge there. Still it was a fun game, the gadgets were impressive, the scenery seemed to fit and have that gritty feel. I was also pleasantly suprised how this single location could provide a good variety even returning to areas you have been to before. The story, voice acting, gameplay were all on target for me. Its one of those games that screams unreal engine when i see it and overall was a good game. The GOTY version has various challenges and dlc challenges that didn't particularly interest me but i can see it giving alot more longevity to the game as well as collecting the various riddler trophys etc. Overall a good experience and can see why it was awarded a game of the year edition. I'd recommend this game.			"

												While Batman Arkham Asylum lacks many of the gameplay improvements and larger environments that later games in the series introduced, its linear design and single story thread offer something that later games in the series lost over time: focus. Arkham Asylum is a dense and highly detailed setting that is ripe for exploration. Tucked away everywhere are mysterious hidden rooms and passages which contain references to the Dark Knight's history and offer the player alluring tales about the dark secrets hidden within the asylum.The game's general art and character designs are also more true to the comic books' outlandish and extravagant art than previous games in the series are, as they opted for more gritty and realistic designs. This gives the game an exciting and somewhat fantastical tone that highly effective in making you want to progress through the plot, which itself is a highly well written and performed tale, that will hold your attention throughout the duration of the game.Neither the freeflow combat nor the predator encounter systems are as tight or varied as they are in later titles, but that isn't to say they're dull. They are both still rock solid in their handling and execution, and form the backbone to what I believe are, to this day, the game's strongest gameplay feature: its boss battles. In comparison to other games in the series, Arkham Asylum's boss battles are grand and have a sense of immense scale. Many of the bosses themselves are presented as gigantic titans which need to be brought down in some amazing manner, thus making the task of doing so a tense and highly rewarding experience. Other games, with maybe the exception of Arkham City, largely abandoned this style of boss fight making Arkham Asylum's maybe the best in the series.So while Arkham Asylum may not feature all the great gameplay advances achieved in later games, the manner in which it progresses in such a highly focused way, in terms of both its world and story, insures that players will have a superb gaming experience.

												This is it. This was the game that had started it all.Batman Arkham Asylum is a great game to play, and offers a great storyline. The graphics are good, and is a very enjoyable and strategic game.There are many boss fights that are intense and are full of non-stop action. If you have played this game before in the past (like I have on the Xbox 360), you'll still love the awesome and fast-paced gameplay of Batman Arkham Asylum. Nostalgia!I would highly recommend this game for anybody who wants to recite/start off the first game of the Batman Arkham franchise!Overall, this game is a great addition to my games library! :)			"

												If you love Batman, whether it's the movies or the comics, this game is a must have because let's face it; we all want to be Batman and this game simulates perfectly what the dark knight would face when up against the Joker in the Asylum. It is probably one of the best superhero games ever made, with it's epic combat and vivid storyline. I've played this game twice (normal and hard) and gained 100% completion. The challenges are extremely hard to gain full trophies on but I found it worth the time and effort and I hope you will too. The graphics are cool, the gameplay is amazing and this is only the beginning... Become the Bat!			"

												Batman: Arkham Asylum. A game started as by Batman fans, for Batman fans as a love letter. The one that started it all. The first Arkham game has aged rather well, and is still fun to play to this day. The story in my opinion is a bit better than City, (Due to the fact that this one I didn't figure out the plot by looking at the voice actors) The story starts like this: Batman has recently captured the Joker, who set off a large fire in Blackgate Prison, causing the Blackgate prisoners to be moved to Arkham Asylum. Batman escorts Joker personally to Arkham. While delivering him to his cell under heavy security, Joker manages to escape while Harley Quinn, has taken control over Arkham. Batman has to go after them for the first (Maybe) long night of things he could have never expected.  Combat options are very limited and not as refined compared to Arkham City, and Arkham Knight, but still has the Arkham feel to it which City and Knight just made better.The Predator options are also much less fun compared to City due to how little gadgets there are, and no grate, vent, or quick takedowns. But, the fan favourite, the Inverted takedown is in this game. All in all a great Batman game, and one people will remember as one of the better ones. I give this game, A 9/10			"

												I didn't play this game until late 2015 (so a bit late to the party) and not until after playing Batman: Arkham Origins so my perspective is naturally compared against my experience with the later title. Since then I've played all of the Arkham titles and am a big fan.Arkham Asylum, being the first entry into the francise for Rocksteady, is the simplest of the bunch. The gameplay is far more linear and the graphics are noticeably simpler (mainly the cape). However, despite the minor drawbacks, if you've played any of the other entries in the series and enjoyed them, you will not be disappointed here. The gameplay itself is very similar and the story is great.If you've never played a Batman Arkham game before, I highly recommend that you do and you might as well start here because it is the beginning of the story (well, in a way Origins is). I had been away from gaming for several years (far too long) and it was Arkham Orgins that pulled me back in. The prospect of playing as Batman in an open-world 3rd person environment was the initial grab. The game mechanics and the story kept me hooked. The fighting mechanics are so much fun but take a bit of practice to really master. I'm not an expert on the Batman comics but I understand that the story here pulls from some of the most acclaimed comic material. And execution was made wonderfully with some notable voice acting talent from 'Batman The Animated Series.'			"

												I can't stress enough how amazing this game is.  The game looks great to this day, and is very well optimized.  The combat is fun and flows so well, and with different types of enemies thrown in together it's always keeping you on your toes, making you change strategy mid fight.  There is always a surprise thrown in to keep it fun and engaging.  But that's not all this game is about, there is also Riddler Challenges.  Whether it is a characters Hat you must seek out in a room, a trophy, or a hidden question mark you can only see in detective vision.  There are over 70 of these challenges, it keeps the game fresh and add's a puzzle element to the game.Last but not least, if you were ever a fan of Metroid, or Castlevania, then you will love this game.  The level design reminds me so much of those two games.  Seeing a cracked wall with a Riddler Trophy on the other side but not having the right tool to get to it.  Basically a ""come back later when you have this item"".  The game is linear, but they do such a great job at streaming together the Asylum, and taking you to places you never thought existed.  You will be doing alot of back tracking, so if you miss an item don't worry, you are able to go back to anywhere in the Asylum.  The game is not short at all, and has you interacting with all of your favorite villians from Batman's universe.  The game is a blast and if you haven't played it yet, then there is something wrong with you!			"

												There's not much point in writing an in depth review for Arkham Asylum given the wealth of positive reviews out there so, in short, this game makes you feel like Batman. I played using an Xbox controller and the controls and targeting system were so intuitive that there was no learning curve; I just went into Arkham and did some stealthy stuff, beat up a bunch of bad guys and propelled myself into the darkness with some crazy gadget. Job done, and I felt awesome.The best thing I could say about this game is that while everything feels so effortless, it's also quite difficult. I don't entirely understand how they managed to do that, but keeping that balance certainly isn't easy. Arkham Asylum does this so well that you just come out of the game feeling like a hero.I only have one bad thing to say about this game, and that is that I wanted to hang every bad guy from a gargoyle, but it's just not possible. The game even actively tried to stop me from doing so at one point, like I was a child being scolded for eating too much candy.10/10 would have myself commited again.			"

												Arkham Asylum is one of the best games of all time. The first of Rocksteady's trilogy of Batman games, Asylum is perhaps the most clean-structured of them. Small area, vibrant foes, and one big plot in the background. Add to it the voices being those from the Animated Series and it just... fits. Seriously, Kevin Conroy as Batman, Arleen Sorkin as Harley Quinn, and the greatest Joker of them all, Mark Hamill... Yeah... just perfection.Add in the combat system (which took a little time to get used to) and it is excellent.The visuals are also striking... though you might miss most of it with detective vision having such an appeal to it. Which brings me to the gadgets, Batman's stock in trade. They are effective in their own way. And this game does set the stage for what comes after.			"

												As much as I love playing creative indie games, it is really refreshing to play a game with a huge budget where they worked closely with Nvidia to optimize the graphics and make a 3D Vision ready game. What I mean by all of this is: Batman: Arkham Asylum looks gorgeous! There were even a few scenes that had a lot of PhysX effects going on that my GTX 670 struggled with. I wouldn't have guessed that it came out in 2009. One of my biggest pet peeves is when games that look great have cutscenes that have been rendered in 720p (I'm looking at you, Mass Effect series) but the only difference I could see in Asylum was that the cutscenes were not in 3D.I'm not a huge Batman fan, so I don't know who most of the villains are; I only learned about Two Face when I watched The Dark Knight. Arkham Asylum does a very good job of introducing the characters and giving their backgrounds. They even have a little bio section for each major character with both in-universe and real life facts about them. I could tell that most of the character designs were new takes on those characters, and I definitely think that they were done well. I found it a little odd that almost every single person in the game was ripped, but this is Batman after all.Mark Hamill did a phenomenal job voicing the Joker. He was easily the most interesting character tho listen to, and I intentionally died a couple of times so I could listen to him taunt me.Each main villain had a couple of levels devoted to them. My personal favorite were the Scarecrow levels because I got to relive some of the defining moments in Batman's life. By that I mean I got to see his parents die.The gameplay is pretty basic: left-click to hit people, and right-click to counter when they try to hit you. Some enemy types switch this up a little by making you stun them first or dodging behind them before you can hit them, but ultimately it only adds one extra button that you have to hit before taking them down.My favorite parts of the game were the rooms where there were a bunch of armed thugs in a large area, and I had to figure out how to take them down without being seen. It reminded me of the scenes in Batman Begins down by the docks where Batman did just that. Unfortunately I wasn't quite as good at it as the real Batman.The detective ""puzzles"" were fairly interesting, but usually very straightforward. I felt like I was doing less detective work and more just following a trail that the developers would only let me see if I turned on the special goggles.My least favorite parts by far were the boss battles. They were clearly constructed exactly the same way that boss battles were made back in the 90's. I was usually stuck on a platform below the much larger boss, performing the same actions multiple times while looking for patterns in their attacks so I knew when they were vulnerable.It took me a little over 10 hours to complete the story. It seemed like I wasn't missing much by not exploring heavily; the main missions took me all over the island. It would have been nice to have gotten more of the audio logs, which were pretty amusing, and I only found a fraction of the Riddler trophies. I'm definitely not a completionist.Overall I enjoyed the game a lot, and I would recommend that anyone who thinks Batman is the coolest play it. It's currently $20, which is a pretty reasonable price.			"

												Batman: Arkham Asylum is pretty cool I guess.You play as a man with the world's deadest parents: Bruce Wayne who uses all of his dosh to become a lunatic in a bat suit. But he knows kung fu so its okay I guess. The combat is pretty satisfying for what it actually is. You have two buttons for combat that also handle gadgets like your spider-man web sling and your ninja stars. Also, you're a ninja. Neat. Unless you're playing on a keyboard where you have to pull some quarter-circle forward's street fighter♥♥♥♥♥♥just to throw your big dumb bat shaped ninja stars at ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who have it in their mind that just because there are two of them that they can take the big 6'3 angry man in the bat suit. Batman has a vast array of gadgets to hunt down his girlfriend: the Joker. These gadgets include: Batarangs, explosives, grappling hook, goblin darts, cancer vision, a car that you can't drive, action blanket, and his power frown. Oh yeah, and there's stealth, which is also cool. The big dumb mooks that try to kill batman (because that's worked before) sometimes have guns and you need to be super sneaky like the Burger King, only instead of delicious whoppers, you hand out pain. It's cool to see the mooks♥♥♥♥♥♥themselves once they realize that maybe trying to stop the one guy without super powers that has the ability to call himself a super hero is not the best idea. Should you play this game? Probably, I guess, I'm not your mom. I stuck around to get all the cheevos so my opinion is pretty great. I say this game is a solid 9/11. Only slightly better than Superman 64. The Alligator man boss fight was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, though.			"

												Arkham Asylum may seem a bit linear and somewhat limited compared to the newer Arkham series games now, but it still stays a truly nice game to play through. Pros :- good fighting system and infiltration sequences- immersive atmosphere and sound design- good story with convincing voice acting- decent graphics still todayCons :- not many sidequests appart from colletibles- may seem a bit linear- relatively small and restricting map- seeing the batmobile and not being able to use it ... yet.

												Batman: Arkham Asylum is one of the best superhero games I've ever played. I've never seen a developer do such an awesome superhero game since Spider-Man 2. It's a game where you play as Batman as he tries to stop the criminals within Arkham Asylum of succeeding in their plans of killing countless people. Why is this game so great? Well, there are a lot of reasons really. The gameplay. It's so good. Whenever I play fire this game up on my laptop and play on a challenge map, I enjoy just fighting enemies. The combat freeflow system is amazing, you fight seamlessly from goon to goon punching them, kicking them, breaking their arm, throwing them, the combat flows so smoothly. It feels so satisfying to fight enemies with the freeflow system that Rocksteady implented. Everything connects together so well. Other than the freeflow system, the stealth is pretty satisfying when you pull it off well. The gadgets Batman uses are pretty awesome, you can set traps for enemies while you lure them in. The gameplay in Arkham Asylum is awesome, Arkham City improves on it though.The story revolves around Batman and his usual foes as he tries to stop them from killing guards and tons of innocents. You get to fight iconic batman villains such as Scarecrow, Killer Croc, Joker, Poison Ivy and Bane.Joker is awesome in the game, laughing maniacally as he cracks his jokes. Mark Hamill does Joker justice, his voice is perfect. Kevin Conroy also did a great job as Batman.Get it even if you're not a Batman fan, it's amazing.Characters: 9/10Story: 8.5/10Gameplay: 9/10Sound: 8/10Overall: 9/10 "

												Play as Batman, taking on violent and psychopathic criminals running rampant over Arkham! Arkham Asylum features puzzles, exploration, and backtracking, making it almost like a classic 3D platformer.Combat looks and feels extremely fluid, making it very satisfying to take on and transition between multiple enemies in a brawl. Can occasionally feel button mashy, but does a good job of punishing you for doing so, encouraging you to play reactively/predictively. Both the puzzles and combat feel hard enough to be rewarding, yet easy enough to rarely make you struggle.On top of the gameplay, theres plenty for DC fans, with backstory in the form of collectible interview tapes and bio's from classic villains from the series. Also Mark Hamill's performance as The Joker was amazing!			"

												In this game you play as the one and only Batman as he takes on the Joker and his minions in Arkham Asylum. Arkham Asylum has lots of detail for a prison and you will be able to explore it as you look for the Riddler's Challenge trophies, interview tapes, and solve environmental puzzles (mostly just puns). Only complaint is that it only has 2 bosses practically. All the boss fights except for the Ivy one have you against tough Bane like inmates. But if you like Batman you will enjoy playing through anyways. A small complaint is that if you use xbox360e for your non 360 controllers it will disable achievements. I had to use it cause with my Wii controller pro because it inverted the right stick on both the X and Y axis.The combat is really fun too and requires more timing than how it looks on video. You also get to play with toys that are sort of like Zelda items since they open up new areas. And if you like the Batman franchise you will be rewarded with your favorite villains in audio interview and the spirit of Armaedus Arkham.			"

												I was pretty late to the party on this one. However, five years after release this title stands as one of the greatest games I've ever played. I've always been a huge fan of Batman, but I never expected to be immersed in that world and character so intensely. The gameplay is great, the story fits perfectly into the existing Batman mythos, and the visuals stand up TO. THIS. DAY. I couldn't believe how spot on they were with even the smallest details, and how well they fleshed out the geography of the Asylum. Just when you think the game would begin to get stale they throw you a curveball, or a different style of gameplay. Whether it be Scarecrow's fear gas induced hallucinations, or a mad dash from a raging Killer Croc, I was consistently entertained and surprised throughout. And I'm not a major completionist, but I couldn't help but solve everything the Riddler threw at me throughout the game.This game is timeless. 10/10, would Batman again.			"

												I'm not a big fan of Batman, having never read the comics or even seen all of the big new films.However, I enjoyed this game a lot.It's a solid adventure game set in an island prison.Iconic Batman villains have all made their way there and are running loose until you go punch them in the face.It has its rough edges here and there, but honestly, I had a great time with this.My main gripe, one that had me stumped for a good long while, was the 'investigate' mechanic.This is mapped to holding the left bumper (or whatever keyboard button switches on detective mode). Investigating things in the game is explained once at the very start, then used for optional collectibles and backstory, then suddenly, well past the halfway point, makes its return critical to the game's progress.I'd by then completely forgotten how to trigger this and the game doesn't re-explain the mechanic or even list it in the controls or help functions. I eventually had to dig through guides and walkthroughs for a refresher on how this core game mechanic worked.The rest of the game is totally fine though.Batman and its universe will always be a bit silly in a totally straight-faced way, but this outing definitely showed that it can be presented in a way enjoyable to non-fans as well.

												-Shortcut Review-Cool, first entry of the Arkham series. Graphics look great for a game that's over 7 years old. It's an action, somewhat ""open-world"", adventure game with a subtle touch of eerie vibes. You might need to install NVidia drivers in order to play the game, especially if you carry AMD drivers. Story is intriguing, but not something that is not over the top or that has you at the edge of your seat. All the events are set at The Asylum. Literatly. Huge cast of villians and other characters from the comics including Batman, of course (duh). Control scheme is enjoyable and makes it easy to play as the Dark Knight. Technically, you can play the game as standalone, but it does leave you to play the entire Arkham series. -Full Review (Somewhat Spoiler free)-Overview: Now, if you're not familiar with the Batman franchise, at least note that this guy can just kick your♥♥♥♥♥by just glaring at you. He is an expert martial artist and an excellent strategist with a degree in physical humiliation. He is calm and level-headed at every alarming moment with a high sense of intelligence and problem solving. At this point in Gotham, Batman is a seasoned veteran, along with his partner, The Oracle, contains a notorious record for incarcerating villians at fault of violent crimes. This is where the Joker, aka the ""Prince of Crimes"", is finally caught by the Cape Crusaider and thrown into Arkham Asylum. However, all further punishment is thrown out the window as the asailant escapes and completely takes over the entire facility with the help of Harleyquinn and their henchmen. The combat system unlocks gadgets and skills once the player gathers experience points. These various gadgets include the classic batarang and batclaw as well as other weapons such as the explosive gel that explodes on walls and grounds. Batman gets stronger and more versatile: the more he's able to take down enemies and go into secret areas that are not so easy to reach. His ""Bat Investigating"" vision is the best out of his skills, because he is able to find hidden clues and figure out what gadget he must use when needed. As Batman explores further into Arkham Asylum, he constantly runs in radical moments where he has to free hostiles from his enemies before they are doomed. Batman is great at being incognito, so it's awesome gameplay when you go through small air vents and drop down on enemies from more than 10 feet high. Not only does Batman has to worry 'bout these hostiles, but he has to take down supervillians like Scarecrow, Killer Croc, The Riddler and more that are running loose in the facility. Each supervillian will challenge Batman through puzzles and some levels become platformers as Batman must survive every one of them. There are way too many sidequests that can be completed for rewards. About over 200 missions that can be fun, but then becomes a dragging chore after awhile. Kinda takes out the joy of game for me 'cause I gotta be aware of the sidequests. The Riddler will have Batman to find scattered trophies and footprints throughout the game. Also, Batman can unlock the origins of Arkham Asylum and gather patient recordings from supervillians to hear audio about his foes. Some gadgets can be useful such as the Batvision and clue scanner to find these achievements. Very fun game to play that doesn't require much thought. Best feats are the combant system and gagets. Not a fan for the huge disarray of sidequests because they're essential for 100% complete game. Cheers			"

												Great game for Batman fans, true to comics with tonnes of dialogue and also lore to read; character bios and 'patient interviews'. Also great as a beat-em-up even if you aren't into the story. Slightly awkward KB+M controls by default (batarang and counter both being RMB) but works great with controller.Optionally quite a challenging game if you want it to be - even the riddles are a nice diversion that need some thought!Although I'm glad GFWL has died it did mean the loss of savegames but I am enjoying starting over and playing the game more thoroughly. It is possible to transfer GFWL saves over to Steam, however.			"

												I was pretty late to the party on this one. However, five years after release this title stands as one of the greatest games I've ever played. I've always been a huge fan of Batman, but I never expected to be immersed in that world and character so intensely. The gameplay is great, the story fits perfectly into the existing Batman mythos, and the visuals stand up TO. THIS. DAY. I couldn't believe how spot on they were with even the smallest details, and how well they fleshed out the geography of the Asylum. Just when you think the game would begin to get stale they throw you a curveball, or a different style of gameplay. Whether it be Scarecrow's fear gas induced hallucinations, or a mad dash from a raging Killer Croc, I was consistently entertained and surprised throughout. And I'm not a major completionist, but I couldn't help but solve everything the Riddler threw at me throughout the game.This game is timeless. 10/10, would Batman again.			"

												The Batman game that spawned a combat system that still haunts us today. Luckily the combat system is fun, and being sneaky stealthy gadgety Batman never goes out of style. Final boss is a disappointment compared to the rest of the game, and luckily the collectibles scattered are all optional and not progression gated so you never feel like you have to dig for more Riddler trophies to advance. I still went out of my way to get them anyways because I'm a sucker. Feels like a 3d Metroidvania, and plays like one.Had  agood time, would definitely recommend to anyone who even passively likes Batman.			"

												To be honest what Rocksteady did with Batman in its first iteration Arkham Asylum is nothing short of a master stroke for the 3rd person fighter/combat system that has reverberated throughout game design and thinking of 3rd person games to date.      Arkham Asylum is a triumph in every aspect. Combat, story (characters, voice acting, etc), atmosphere, sound design and even graphical fidelity. This game captures what it is to be batman and my god its DAMN FUN. The developers going into making Arkham Asylum said ""What can we do to make you feel like batman right away, as soon as we give the player control we want them to feel like a bad(t♥♥♥♥♥(pardon the pun). You feel like batman, the way your character is animated and moves, the freeflow combat system has you jumping around bruising bad people until the cows come home with some of the most satisfying combat I have played to date.      Here is a huge thing for me, and for all Batman fans. I watched the cartoon as a kid. Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamil all brought the cartoon and that world to vivid life. Well guess what guys, they got just about everyone from the cartoon to revoice their characters in Arkham Asylum, Harley, Gordon, Batman, Joker, Scarcrow etc. It is an incredible cast and it immerses you so fully in the world you almost never want to leave. The world that Rocksteady has recreated is fantastic, with dark colors and almost a noirish feel to the game that sucks you deeper and deeper into the world. You truly ARE batman in this game. It reminds me of a mixture of the cartoon and Tim Burtons dark seedy take on Batman. It is truly a game to be experianced.     So would I recommend this game? Abso♥♥♥♥inglutely. If you enjoy 3rd person fighting games with smooth combat systems that just make you want to sing while you are playing them. THIS GAME IS FOR YOU. If you are a fan of the Batman universe, cartoon, or comics YOU OWE it to yourself to pick up and play this game. It is absolutely fantastic.I would recommend this game to just about anyone who enjoys a solid, FUN game in every aspect. I would honestly give this game a 9 out of 10. Top 20 in my list of favorite games of all time.See you in Arkham City Batfans. _Rog			"

												If you like the Batman series, movies and comics, you HAVE to play this game.There is simply no Batman game before this one (except the C64 version of Batman the Movie, which is really old) which gives you the true Batman feeling.The stealth moving is great, the fighting is solid, the gadgets are nice and the puzzles are not to easy yet not to hard.And without spoiling any detailed content of the game..... Batman get's a hard time in this game. He really has to work.			"

												This review comes from an FPS-biased gamer, so it took some time (i.e. 4 years after this game launched) for me to play it, mostly because I bought it late, and partly because I was waiting for steamworks.Now that it's supported, GFWL is gloriously gone and the steam achievements are seamless. As for the game, the intro is nice and the visuals are impressive, but I found that the game really assumes that you know what you're doing and where you're going. The map system is terrible, and I found myself doubling back down corridors over and over to figure where the heck I was supposed to be. Half the items you see as you play the game you can't collect until after you've unlocked certain upgrades, which is frustrating, and frankly a poor way to convince a completionist to go back through all the levels he's gotten lost in and ask him to go find more trophies. Nevertheless, I did it all.The main campaign has a solid story and - as a person who is not intimately familiar with every villian - I enjoyed reading the back stories on the characters I unlocked. The immersion level is very good, and the controls are intuitive.Challenge mode gets a little frustrating, but it's worth it to see the achievements pop at the end.Overall: It's a solid Batman game with some flaws, and while it doesn't stack up for me with the top games, it's still a worthy endeavor.

												아캄버스 시리즈의 시작을 알리는 기념비적인 어사일럼. 수없이 나왔다 소리도 없이 사라지는 히어로게임들중에 최고라 칭할수있는 시리즈의 시작이다. 빌런과 배트맨의 캐릭터성을 너무나도 잘살린 여러가지 연출과 초보자들에게도 쉽게 다가갈수있는 전투방식. 잡입게임으로도 플레이가 가능할정도의 맵디자인 패드사용시 알게돼는 너무나도 뛰어난 타격감. GOTY라는 타이틀이 전혀 어색하지가 않다. 최고 단점으로는 연출에만 집중한듯한 힘빠지는 보스전. 그 구성과 여러가지 캐릭터성은 잘살린듯하지만 자세히 보면 그저 평소 전투의 연속된 측면이 많다. 리들러 챌린지는 도전과제를 달성한다는 재미와 아캄버스의 세계관을 좀더 잘알수있게 해주는 측면도 있지만. 누군가에게는 그저 안해도 그만인 숨은 트로피 찾기가 된다. 어찌보면 양날의 검같은 시스템. 여러가지로 많은 재미를 안겨주었지만 2회차 플레이의 동기화를 못찾게 해주고. 리들러챌린지의 반만큼만 사이드 미션이 있다면 어쨌을까라는 아쉬움도 많이 남는다. 너무나도 괜찮은 작품이기에 그만큼 사소한것도 아쉬워지는 작품이다.

												Critically acclaimed Batman: Arkham Asylum returns with a remastered Game of the Year Edition, featuring 4 extra Challenge Maps. The additional Challenge Maps are Crime Alley; Scarecrow Nightmare; Totally Insane and Nocturnal Hunter (both from the Insane Night Map Pack).This Game is fantastic, the graphics are superb (if you play in very high). Batman Arkham Asylum has one of the best combat i have ever seen in video games, the takedowns, the punches , kicks are just superb. Considering this game was made in 2010, it has very extremely good graphics (if you are playing on very high). The Game offers a variety of different things so you will not get bored of playing, If you don't want to play the missions, you can do challenges or riddles. Every Aspect of Batman Arkham Asylum is Superb. Loving this game so far. I still need to play Batman Arkham City but so far this is my favourite superhero game. Definitely Recommend playing.10/10 Fantastic Game. "

												Batman: Arkham Asylum is one of the best third-person stealth-action games ever made, and the best video game released by Rocksteady Studios so far. It's a fun and immersive game whether you're a DC fan or not. While the game plot is based on the comic books and not the movies, you don't need any prior experience with either to really enjoy the atmosphere created by the developers. All the action takes place on the island-bound asylum known as Arkham. Environments range from run-down morgues to a crumbling neo-gothic mansion, all of which look lush. Assisting the Joker is his army of convict henchmen who can be dispatched using vicious hand-to-hand combat moves. With no real special powers , Batman relies only on his training and gagdets. Luckily the hero can counter his enemies' close-quarter combat moves with ease, and the animation is breathtakingly fluid.			"

Actions speak louder than words in this case.This is a game that should be played by any serious gamer, comic book lover or Metroidvania lover. An amazing experience.

There's extra side challenges you can do to extend the length of the game such as collecting riddles or finding interviews of the inmates, but overall looks like the game shouldn't take much longer than 10 hours to beat if you play it straight through.The animation is very smooth and fluid and the action makes you really feel like you're kicking some♥♥♥♥♥  Some may find this a little too streamlined, but upgrade the difficulty level and you'll learn quick that you can have full control of the action rather than button mashing to win the fight.Good mixture of stealth/action, puzzles, and adventure.Great game!

												With the recent announcement of Batman: Arkham Knight, no better time to replay where the adventure began. The game still looks great, is very expansive with lots of secrets to discover and challenges to conquer, and a story that involves a good amount of Batman's Rogue Gallery without them feeling tacked on. Although the combat forces you to be more tactical due to it demanding more precise button presses, and thus, making the gameplay a little slower, it still holds up to this day. Surprising, as it's still more responsive and precise than Origins. No Batman fan should go without playing this game.			"

												The first in the Batman:  Arkham series and it opens on a good note.  I find the combat quite enjoyable to begin with even though as you become more aware of the mechanics of combat it becomes more about countering rather than punching.  The story is intriguing even though it's all set on the island of Arkham Asylum.  I 100% completed the game in under 40 hours, so it's not like it has a long life-span, but nonetheless if you enjoy being Batman (who doesn't?), then I recommended picking up this first part of the series.

												A metroid-vania style beat em up which is probably the closest you'll ever come to actually being batman. The fighting engine is simple but really satisfying, with a combo systen that rewards skill. For a console port the visuals here are really nice, especially if you have an Nvidia card. The game makes very good use of physx with fog that shifts as you walk through it and tiles smashing off the floor as you introduce it to mooks heads. The boss fights were a bit rubbish and the ending was a letdown though.The second game which I don't own on PC is equally good, but with tons more content.			"

COMPLETED 100%A fine game, typical of Unreal Engine 3 structure, that is flawless in design and gameplay. The fighting mechanics is amazingly fluid and smooth and it's simple for Batman to easily leap around to enemies, even those far away from him, with the press of a button. Game is technically open world; small in size but non-linear with different distinct separate areas to explore. Can't find anything bad to say about the game but it's easy to see why it's rated so highly. IMO The Amazing Spiderman game is better than this though.			"

It's a ton of fun and feels like a Batman adventure from start to finish.			"

												For those who don’t already know about this treasure I only discovered and played recently Batman: Arkham Asylum is an excellent story action/stealth action game, any Batman or DC fan would love.Pros; Nice fighting mechanics (I played Mad Max before this and read many reviews about how the fighting style was similar this is just as good with sometimes better visuals when you unlock the moves), you will take on small to large groups of enemies in a smack/counter moves. For those who enjoy Stealth based games this has plenty, I’m not a big fan of this genre but was pleasantly surprised it didn’t take over and was easy to get into and perform those silent take downs without being seen. Some nice boss/villain fights to keep you entertained. A few minor puzzles and collectables in the form of Riddler riddles, some of which require you to grapple, climb or just scan areas in far off corners. Excellent story as mentioned before as Batman battles an array of villains as well as a nice steady progress as the henchmen themselves get harder to defeat.Cons; Personally the only thing that slightly annoyed me was the Scarecrow sections as the game seemed to switch from 3D to a strange 2D style, this also occurred in a few fights towards the end. Not a big issue but did confuse me as the normal game view and ability to move the camera were just fine.Overall and excellent game that holds up to many even to this date well worth is asking price even more so if on sale, thumbs up!

												Lets start things off with Metal Gear Solid. That game was my of all time favorite. No other game could touch the espionage play and the fantastic story. Untill Batman Arkham Asylum bummped MGS as My #1. With repect to MGS it is bested just slightly. A very close second on my list. Thanks MGS for a long standing above the rest. Now BAA takes the spotlight. This game follows the feel of Batman Dark Night with the voices of Kevin Conroy as Batman and Mark Hamill as Joker. (I honestly believe BAA could not have done well with out thier voices) Also Bat gadgets to suit the moment. Great fighting controls. Dark brooding music and it would not be Batman without detective work.  As you are looking for clues, Joker is throwing verbal comical abuse to your efforts in finding him and you can't help but smerk and even bust out laughing!  Also, lots of extra challenges for when you finish the game. Online score charts show how well you do against the world. GET THIS GAME!  ***** #1 all time fav			"

The combat is one of the most realistic I've seen so far. The only thing I was bit disappointed were the boss fights with the different villans. They tried to make the boss fights different than the usual boss fights you fight in any game, but ended up being boring.			"

												Batman: Arkham Asylum is the greatest comic book videogame of all time -- and the Game of the Year Edition just adds to that. This is an adult Dark Knight story that is well-told, packs some truly fun gameplay elements, has topnotch voice talent, and feels like it's part of Batman canon. If I have to nitpick, I wish the cutscenes looked better as they can distract from the tale and that the AI was a bit more responsive, but those are tiny flaws that shouldn't distract from the big picture. Rocksteady nailed what Batman is supposed to feel like. Fans, rejoice.			"

Also, the hallucinations from the fear gas are extremely well done.For those of you who are afraid this game might be a bit outdated compared to its younger brothers, City & Origins, don't!

												Despite never being a fan of the DC Universe I always heard and thought great things about Batman Arkham Asylum. I was surprised when I first played it really hooked me up. The combat was probably the thing that got me most excited, it felt so satisfying to just punch guys in the face and do all those crazy moves. Another thing I really liked is that despite Arkham Asylum having a linear story they do give you the feel that you are allowed to go anywhere you want in Arkham Island and explore, I really appreciate when they do that and as you unlocked more gadgets backtracking came into place in case I wanted to get all the trophies and solve all the riddles which I actually didn't. The graphics are pretty good looking and I really like the grim atmosphere of the Asylum. Ocasionally there are some ""puzzle"" and stealth sections which I think they are important because they bring someone of a variety to the gameplay. Despite the enemies kept being the same over and over I feel like the boss battles made up for it. That said I really enjoyed my time with Batman Arkham Asylum but I really couldn't be bothered with getting all the collectibles and playing each challenge but overall I do think it is a great game.

												Not only is Arkham Asylum one of the best superhero games, It's probably one of the best video games of all time. Playing through it once a few years back was already great, but playing through it again made me appreciate it even more. City might be bigger and better in almost every way, but Asylum's still got the atmosphere. 9/10★★★★½ "

												Its more of a thinking man's puzzle game with a pretty solid fighting/combat system.  The emphasis is more on detective work than just straight beat 'em up in an alley, and thats not as bad as it might sound.  If you watched the 90s cartoon, you'll love this.  Original voice acting with a lot more adult theme to it (swearing, skimpy female costumes) and the story is actually really good if a little bit predictable (spoiler: batman wins lol!).  The challenges are pretty hard and IMO not worth much, but they're still there.  TL;DR: This is a good value at $7.50 or lower.			"

												I just bought this at the Steam Summer Sale and I gotta tell ya, this is a blast!  With no disrespect to people who loves this genre, I found it kind of like brain candy.  I play a lot of strategy games (Civ5, Endless Legend) and RPG's that have an abundance of puzzles.  It's nice to just jump into Arkham and introduce psycho clowns to Mr. Bat Fist.  The game mechanics are smooth and the combat is incredibly simple to pick-up without resorting to ""button mashing.""I can hardly wait to finish this one off and get into the sequel.Enjoy all!			"

												Great game with beautiful atmospheric graphics.  The voice acting is way above par and the storyline is as good as any comic based game or movie can possibly offer.  There's extra side challenges you can do to extend the length of the game such as collecting riddles or finding interviews of the inmates, but overall looks like the game shouldn't take much longer than 10 hours to beat if you play it straight through.The animation is very smooth and fluid and the action makes you really feel like you're kicking some♥♥♥♥♥  Some may find this a little too streamlined, but upgrade the difficulty level and you'll learn quick that you can have full control of the action rather than button mashing to win the fight.Good mixture of stealth/action, puzzles, and adventure.Great game!

												Batman: Arkham Asylum is the greatest comic book videogame of all time -- and the Game of the Year Edition just adds to that. This is an adult Dark Knight story that is well-told, packs some truly fun gameplay elements, has topnotch voice talent, and feels like it's part of Batman canon. If I have to nitpick, I wish the cutscenes looked better as they can distract from the tale and that the AI was a bit more responsive, but those are tiny flaws that shouldn't distract from the big picture. Rocksteady nailed what Batman is supposed to feel like. Fans, rejoice.			"

												For those who don’t already know about this treasure I only discovered and played recently Batman: Arkham Asylum is an excellent story action/stealth action game, any Batman or DC fan would love.Pros; Nice fighting mechanics (I played Mad Max before this and read many reviews about how the fighting style was similar this is just as good with sometimes better visuals when you unlock the moves), you will take on small to large groups of enemies in a smack/counter moves. For those who enjoy Stealth based games this has plenty, I’m not a big fan of this genre but was pleasantly surprised it didn’t take over and was easy to get into and perform those silent take downs without being seen. Some nice boss/villain fights to keep you entertained. A few minor puzzles and collectables in the form of Riddler riddles, some of which require you to grapple, climb or just scan areas in far off corners. Excellent story as mentioned before as Batman battles an array of villains as well as a nice steady progress as the henchmen themselves get harder to defeat.Cons; Personally the only thing that slightly annoyed me was the Scarecrow sections as the game seemed to switch from 3D to a strange 2D style, this also occurred in a few fights towards the end. Not a big issue but did confuse me as the normal game view and ability to move the camera were just fine.Overall and excellent game that holds up to many even to this date well worth is asking price even more so if on sale, thumbs up!

An excellent game.(Pros/Cons down below if you don't feel like reading it all)I was one, of many, who preordered the, rather dissapointing, Arkham Knight (I got it cheap from a friend, don’t blame me). However, Warner Brothers decided to be a bit empathic and give us all the older Arkham-games, which, to a certain extent, made me forgive them.Enough about that, let’s get to the review. Gameplay The gameplay is really good, flying using the grapping hook is surpringly fun and the combat, while in reality not too advanced and arguably a bit too automated, feels great and is really fun. Batman has a vast arsenal of moves and gadgets to use, many of which need to be unlocked through leveling up, hence keeping the combat fresh and interesting. The game also contains a lot of puzzles, none which are too advanced nor time-consuming to complete, but they do add to the gameplay. Kind of reminds me of the “The Legend of Zelda” games. You might find this comparasion a bit bizarre, and I can’t blame you really. Collectibles are plenty in the game, and while I know that everyone isn’t a fan of them, I find them quite fun to find here, having The Riddler mock you about not having found the rest hardly gets old. That, and the fact many of them require some creativity and/or puzzle solving keeps it interesting. You also get XP from finding them.About XP, as mentioned, the game features a leveling system.It’s quite basic, you gain XP from combat (amount depends on how many moves you managed to do in succession and how varied they were), solving riddles and finding The Riddler’s throphys, plus a few other things.During my playthough I neverfelt like I was under nor overleveled, the game went on at a good pace without any moments were I got stuck.Coming to the controls, I’ve only been albe to try the keyboard/mouse ones, and they work well, could be better, but far from bad. I never felt like they caused any problems, to put it that way. Story/Characters The story is good. Not too advanced so that it gets in the way, nor too mediocre so that everything feels unmotivated. Because it doesn’t, not at all. I’ve played a few games (*cough* Borderlands (1)) where everything simply felt unmotivated and forced, simply because I had no idea on why I was doing this. Before you tell me that I should’ve read the text boxes on the quests, this was co-op. But, enough about that. Where the game really shines is its charatcters, especially the villans. Sure, none of them are original, but they all fit well together in the game, and manages to feel unique, even though they’re high in quantity. While the normal thugs you’ll encounter mostly stay the same, some carry different weapons and/or have armour, which does shake things up a little bit. It’s nothing that ever bothered me playing through the game though. Graphics/Opimisation Runs great on my hardware (specs can be found on profile), for the most part. It does stutter a bit while loading things off the harddrive and one particular scene utilises PhysX a bit too much, leading to a framerate cut in half (from a near constant 62 FPS, which is the cap, to a unstable 30 FPS), and even after the fight it dropped even lower (4-5 FPS). Restarting fixed this though.The graphics hold up well despite their age, and the artstyle is nice. I found no obvious pixelation on any textuers, though you’ll probably be able to find some if you actually look around. The lack of any anti-aliasing aside from MSAA is a bit dissapoining, but not really a problem with today’s hardware. Sound/Audio The soundtrack is good, nothing memorable, but it sets the mood well and does well in the background without disturbing you. Same goes for the voice acting, though perhaps a bit better than the soundtrack, so perhaps I'd go as far as to call it great. No complaints here really.Sounds for actions, such as Batman hitting someone or him grappling up to a ledge are excellent, no complaints here either, not that I'd expect otherwise. Conclusion  Great game, definetly worth playing and buying, even if you aren’t a Batman fan (I wasn’t one before I played this game, to put it that way).8/10 Pros Good story Nice graphics, which still hold up well Good keyboard controlls, haven't tried controller Well optimised The villans are interesting Satisfying combat Cons Some PhysX effects kill the framerate May stutter when loading things off the harddrive Capped at 62 FPS Only anti-aliasing avaible is MSAA "

												I know, shocking isn't it? I actually liked a game that everyone else does. (Although, I could talk about why I don't like Arkham City, but let's think about the positives!)Batman: Arkham Asylum was a game that everyone expected would be crappy but it turned out to be good... blah blah blah, everyone knows the stories. And if you've seen anyone's review of Arkham Asylum, my opinions are pretty similar, so for once I'll actually condense my thoughts:PROS:1- Great voice acting from Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill, as expected2- Excellent, intuitive level design and puzzles 3- Well-created world within Arkham Island, that feels very dark and twisted4- Continues telling a story without beating you over the head, like when Ivy takes over, you see all the plants swarm the island5- Fantastic stealth and combat gameplayCONS:1- Uncreative boss fights2- Lots of plot holes3- Sometimes stiff animations (Conversations mainly look very stiff and robot-like)I played this game years ago, and loved it then, so I'm glad to see that my opinion hasn't changed. I planned on taking a break from Steam to try out some Bayonetta and Lollipop Chainsaw on the console, but the temptation was too strong and I gave in. And I actually went out of my way to find out all 240 Riddler Trophies, which (while a little repetitive) was ultimately fun to find. It makes the replay value just a little bit higher.Batman: Arkham Asylum gets an 8/10. With all the things it does so flawlessly well, it's very hard to judge it for its shortcomings. I'm definitely coming back in a few more years to play through a third time. I might even go for 100% completion.			"

The Joker has taken over the Asylum and only Batman can put a stop to the madness. I picked this up during the WB Humble Bundle where it lay unplayed in my Steam library for months, mainly due to the fact I had no way of playing it. Now that I finally have a gaming PC I decided to download and try this Dark Knight Simulator.Now I had only ever played bits of this game on console in the past and I never really understood the hype. But after throwing all the settings on max and jumping into this game I finally saw the light (or the Dark, I guess).Arkham Asylum comes complete with a combo/counter/beat 'em up combat system which has you throwing punches left, right and centre with the finese of a Bat. Get your combo building and the Bat becomes quicker and more powerful. But the fun doesn't end at the combat. The Joker has a night of fun in plan for the Batman and it goes from bad (by bad I mean really, really good) to worse (It starts to get really exciting towards the end.) and seeing all the familiar villians locked away in Arkham suddenly freed and hungry for the blood of the Bat leads to some utterly awesome encounters. The Riddler also has you covered if you are looking for a game with an insane amount of collectables, the only dissapointment with this game was the lack of a New Game Plus function, although this did get rectified in the later sequels!Fancy becoming the Bat for a night in the Joker's Funhouse? Pick this up! You know you want to.			"

												Buy This:If you enjoy 3rd person adventure games with hand to hand combat and stealth sectionsIf you want to REALLY feel like the BatmanI played Batman for the first time early in 2014, and absolutely loved the living crap out of it. This game does just about everything right. The atmosphere, music, story and acting are all top notch. The controls feel fluid and responsive. All I can really say to sum it all up is this game makes you feel like the Batman. There were times while swinging above my enemies, slowly dispatching them one after another I found myself giggling with a psychotic glee. ""Good luck finding me you brain-dead thugs! I'm  Batman!""Arkham Asylum is a 3rd person Metroidvania styled action game. You play as Batman (of course) and explore an insane asylum that has been taken over by The Joker. You're free to explore the asylum (which is a huge island complex) at your leisure, but you are forced along the correct order of places by slowly unlocking new abilities. Each room in Arkham plays out like one of a few minigames depending on what's going on. Sometimes the room will be filled with armed thugs hunting you, and the game becomes a stealth game. You swing from the rafters slowly dispatching enemies that wander too far into the shadows. It is very fun. As more of the thug's friends vanish, they become more and more fearful for their own hide. By the time you're down to the last thug, they're often crying in a corner or shooting randomly all about the room screaming in absolute terror. The game has some rooms that are filled with packs of unarmed enemies you have to beat down with your bat fists. The hand to hand combat is wildly satisfying, and soon you'll be blocking, counter attacking and vaulting everything in a huge blur of bat punches. There are still other sections that become platformers. These require you to navigate all sorts of crazy structures by jumping, swinging and roping all over. These aren't as strong as platforming in say, Prince of Persia, but they are decent and get the job done. There's all sorts of other ways the game changes itself up for you as you progress, but I don't want to spoil the surprise. Just do yourself a favor and go become the Batman.  "

												Fan or no fan, any self respecting gamer should at least have played this game, especially since it has come by in the store a few times now for rediculously low prices. In exchange you will get a immersive, fleshed out, gameplay solid adventure beat-em up that handles like a dream and gives you at least 20 hours of it if you follow the whole story to it's end. Batman fans can count the tons of extra content from the Batman universe as a big plus as the developer really seems to care for the franchise for having nailed most if not everything Batman related on the head.Well done Rocksteady, well done.

												Rocksteady Studios has made a great job. The plot and way by whom is told are excellent. Moreover, many character bios, audios and awesome riddles makes that I wanted to get them all and spend a lot more time playing it. I admit of being fallen in love with its combat system. It looks awesome and doesn't need to use lots of buttons. Visualy it still keeps very well. Developers have done a great job with the Unreal Engine 3. Music is characteristic to Warner Bros productions. It seems to be taken out from a movie. It matches perfectly to the world of the game and entire plot. The only thing I didn't like is Batman's attitude to gadgets. I don't understand why he couldn't get all of them (except those from upgrades) at one time. Even so, it's one of the best games of the last years and a little of other titles can be placed equally with this Batman.			"

												Best. Batman. Game. Ever.Buy it, play it, love it.Out of the current available trilogy (Asylum, City & Origins), this one has clearly the best story and mood. You really feel like you are in the Batman Universe (in part thanks to the awesome voice acting!). Also, the hallucinations from the fear gas are extremely well done.For those of you who are afraid this game might be a bit outdated compared to its younger brothers, City & Origins, don't! Sure, the newer versions have a better flow in general and more stuff to do, but Asylum still feels like the best Batman game out of the bunch.			"

												 ""This is very good game, good story with so many combo and tactic."" I played this with my X-BOX 360 Controller.Story is awersome. I don't like to review this with so many text. because it will be very boring. Pro: - Good system and combo. - You can get In-depth- details and story from this game.- Not too long , however, perfectionist still can enjoy this game by collecting all raddles. - Smart game play with detective theme.Con: - There're few skills for stealth.- It's straight line story.- Many profiles but few bosses.- Man with gun harder than bosses.- You can't drive the car in this game.Worth to buy, and worth to play.And if you're fan of Batman don't miss it.

												Batman: Arkham Asylum might very well be the first great Batman game. Although there's been plenty of Batman games in the past, I think this one perfectly captures the essence of the Dark Knight. Set in Gotham's famous asylum, you'll find yourself fighting against Batman's greatest rival: the Joker himself, as he attempts to pull out one of his greatest plans.The fact that this takes place in the asylum, means that the Joker will not be the only member of Batman's rogues gallery you'll be encountering. Harley Quinn, Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, to name a few. Not to mention that the asylum is filled not only with Joker's henchment, but you'll also run into a few of the crazier inmates as well. Finally, the place itself really makes you feel that you're in Arkham, and it adds a sense of isolation.As far as gameplay goes, you're the Dark Knight. You'll spend a lot of time either beating up several thugs at once, or scaring the heck out of them as you take them out one by one in the predator rooms without being noticed. All of this can be accomplished with the help of Batman's arsenal of gadgets, from the classic Batarangs, to explosive gel. Then there's also Detective Mode, which allows you to scout the area to detect enemies and possible ways to take them down.It's a really good game; I recommend it.			"

												Rocksteady Studios has made a great job. The plot and way by whom is told are excellent. Moreover, many character bios, audios and awesome riddles makes that I wanted to get them all and spend a lot more time playing it. I admit of being fallen in love with its combat system. It looks awesome and doesn't need to use lots of buttons. Visualy it still keeps very well. Developers have done a great job with the Unreal Engine 3. Music is characteristic to Warner Bros productions. It seems to be taken out from a movie. It matches perfectly to the world of the game and entire plot. The only thing I didn't like is Batman's attitude to gadgets. I don't understand why he couldn't get all of them (except those from upgrades) at one time. Even so, it's one of the best games of the last years and a little of other titles can be placed equally with this Batman.			"

												One of the greatest video games I've ever played. Batman: Arkham Asylum GOTY Edition kept me playing it for hours, beating it far more than once, and spending hours into the night simply attempting to find all the collectibles and secrets. Most games ruin themselves with a boring collectibles hunt, but Arkham Asylum brilliantly mixes the need for analyzing the setting as well as fighting off enemies to get to some, and simply manages to keep the game fun even while you're slaving away looking for them. Outside of that, the game is freaking fantastic as well. Taking place all in one night, the Joker has taken over Arkham Asylum, and you have to stop him. It may seem a simple, clishe story, but the introduction of many loved characters from the Batman universe spices up the story a lot, and will keep you on your toes throughout the game. On top of all this, the Tapes system and Character Bios teaches you more than you ever knew about the Batman Universe, letting you delve deeper into the lore of the game, and into the mind of a lunatic. 9.5/10.

												One of the best games of all time, and I cannot believe how I loved this game. I first played it on PS3 back in 2014 and was horrified by how many times I would get lost. However, I must have been stupid! I strongly advise you buy this game, and in my opinion, it is pure gold. While the boss fights could use some work, the game is ultimately still a great experience. This is not exactly something I would call open world, but because it is such a small map it is absolutely CRANKED with detail! There are really nice riddles about the environment in several locations on the map, and figuring those out is one of the best parts of Arkham Asylum. The combat is stellar as you may have heard before, with countless games trying to imitate it but not always reaching their full potential. Well, to say the least, this is one of the most fun combat systems I have ever messed around with. There are gadgets at your disposal which severely impact the flow of combat, in both good ways and bad - depending on how you use them. The story is insanely awesome, and the graphics have CERTAINLY aged well. The story goes that you have captured Joker, and obviously♥♥♥♥♥♥never goes as it should be. Joker is absolutely insane here and is about to... well, I will let you find that out for yourselves. This is a great experience and in some ways better than City, in most ways better than Origins, and story-wise better than Knight. 9/10 from me. Boss fights could be better, but it is a load of fun, and the story is great for any Batman fan to enjoy! Absolutely recommended!			"

												Man this game. Where do I begin?The atmosphere just gets you right in the gut from the beginning of the game. Filling you inside this disturbed and twisted asylum filled with the beloved Batman characters we all know today. It's pretty damn good for just the beginning of the game. It starts already with you capturing Joker, which is a change in pace of the typical Batman stuff we know. However it has, dare I say, realism aspects in the game. This changes the overall mood and pace; this game wants you to take it seriously and they convey a good job of that.The controls are tight and compact. I rarely have issues with them other than some hiccups here and there, but it's rare. It feels very comfortable and smooth, where even the most basic of games like Left 4 Dead have some problems with gamepad support, dispite the limitations. I was playing with a gamepad this run, so the keyboard and mouse may have more polished controls than the standard, though I digress.The characters have, duh, character. The basic batman shows and comics have the same idea, though this game makes it all well and good. I was wondering what character would act like what, and it just left me guessing over and over.My favorite part was the scarecrow sequences. It was just plain brilliant. It had some scare factor, and a level of difficulty to the game. It breaks the action from the typical game and throws you for a loop each sequence: even going as far to break the 4th wall entirely.The ending, however wasn't very polished. For the sake of people wanting to know themselves, I won't spoil this. Though I admit it could be done a little better.Overall, give this game your money. I mean it. It deserves it. And it deserved Game of the Year. Get it. Now.			"

												This is exactly how a 3D Castlevania game should look, except it's better because it's Batman. Such a fantastic universe to explore and get so close, you may end up wondering if you belong with Batman in the Asylum. Gorgeous game, fantastic actors, addictive combat and plenty of collectibles, this is what a fun time looks like.			"

												First game of the trilogy based on the comic, here is the story of Batman being traped in Arkham Asylum by Joker. The ”I am ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BATMAN” feeling is all during the game. Nice gameplay, very good story, Batman voice acting isn't the best, is not enough deep if you ask me, but i'm sure they will resolve in the other games. Joker voice acting and character is brilliant, so well made. If you are a DC fun, go ahead, buy it!Pro:-Gameplay-Story-Graphics-Joker, Harley and Killer Croc voice acting-The creepy atmosphereCons:-Batman voice acting (good, but not good enough)9,5/10			"

												What can we say about the biggest hero of all times? That he deserved a game that caught up with him. And Asylum does just that. It's great, and it has all you could expect from a Batman game: great puzzles, great environment (which makes you really dig into the story) great action, all your favorite characters, some really tough fights and kicking as much *** as you could possibly do!

												Haven't played too much of the PC version, but it ran well when I did play it.  I beat the PS3 version (main story plus Riddler challenges, not all challenge maps).This is an excellent 3d Metroidvania, probably the only truly great one (unless you count the Souls series).  Combat feels great, and has become the standard for many 3d beat-em-ups,  but this isn't really a combat heavy game.  Instead, it's about exploration and noticing all the little details on the island transform as the Joker takes complete control.  It feels tight, with good pacing and a nice mix of environments that subtly change as you backtrack through them.  Everything about the game screams high quality, and it has a good length without getting too repetitive.The best part is that this feels like a Batman simulator in a way that no other video game had.  Everything you do in the game is batman stuff, like tracking tobacco left by Jim Gordon or using your various accessories to zip around.  It feels right, and the controls do what you want them to do, making it easy to pull off Batman moves.However there are some negatives.  My main complaint is that there are really only two different character models for enemies: beefcake guy and Bane-like hulking monstrosity, which makes otherwise fun combat get repetitive.  This is especially true with the boss battles, which almost all devolve into fighting one or more of the two aforementioned enemy types (later bosses throw waves of mobs at you).  For all the detail poured into the environments and presentation, it's disappointing that the boss battles are just minor variations on standard combat, fighting the same old enemies.Also, while the Rogues Gallery is portrayed well, with good voice acting, this version of Batman is incredibly bland in terms of personality and delivery of lines.  There's no brooding, self-reflection or doubt, just a whole lot of robotic self-assuredness.The story is ok, it feels like a typical comic book story (a negative for me but YMMV), but with as many major villains crammed in as possible.  That said, the length is just about perfect, so I didn't spend too much time wondering about certain plot holes.Well worth playing, an excellent example of how to make a 3D metroidvania, or even any video game for that matter.  It goes on sale frequently, so you should be able to get it for around $5 or less.			"

												If you haven't picked up Batman: Arkham Asylum, you're a crazy person. The game came out about a year ago and I declared that it was the best comic book game of all time. What's your deal? Get it. However, if you ignored me, Batman: Arkham Asylum (Game of the Year Edition) has come along and it's a worthy addition to your videogame collection.Batman GOTY is the original game I loved along with four additional challenge maps and the newfound ability to play in 3D. Basically, it's more bang for your buck.Now, before visions of Avatar-like 3D go running through your head, it's important to point out that the 3D in Batman GOTY is super-basic. You turn on the 3D filter from the main menu, pop on a pair of paper glasses with pink and green lenses, and play. It works – the HUD is at the forefront and there's definitely a depth of field effect – but it's not amazing and the glasses wash the color out of the game. That sucks seeing as how the environments and action look so good in Arkham Asylum. The challenge maps are cool. Crime Alley is a fist-fighting challenge where you need to beat four waves of the Joker's men, and it's set in the very alley where Bruce Wayne's parents were killed. Nocturnal Hunter is a silent challenge where you need to take out a bunch of guards and complete some objectives. Meanwhile, Totally Insane and Scarecrow Nightmare throw enemies at you until you fall. All are fun and welcome additions to the regular game's challenges.If you haven't picked up this game, you should have no qualms about grabbing Batman: Arkham Asylum (Game of the Year). If you already own Batman, the 3D and challenge maps (a few of which you can just download) really don't warrant you plunking down your pocket change to buy this one again.Batman: Arkham Asylum is a third-person action game casting you as -- you guessed it, chum -- the Dark Knight himself. The title opens with Batman racing back to Arkham, Gotham's home for the criminally insane, with the Joker in tow. Seems the Clown Prince of Crime broke out a few weeks ago, but Batman was able to track him down and re-apprehend the baddie. However, things are never what they seem with the Joker, so after getting the wiry maniac back into the building -- a building stocked with hundreds of the Joker's goons after a ""mysterious"" fire at their prison -- Mr. J breaks free with the help of Harley Quinn, takes control of the penitentiary, and releases all the inmates.Holy plot twist, Batman!From there, you're off on an adventure that ranks right below The Dark Knight movie in terms of awesome Batman experiences. The actual Arkham campus is a loony bin spread across multiple buildings on one massive rock. With the Joker in charge you're going to have to swing over rooms filled with gas, save doctors, rip vent covers off the walls so you can make a path around locked doors, and move as fast as Batman can to stop the Joker from releasing an army of monsters on the people of Gotham City.Now, that might sound like your typical Batman story -- and it kind of is -- but it's important to point out that this is a fairly adult title. Yeah, some of the folks from Batman: The Animated Series are back to reprise their roles (Mark Hamill is the Joker, Kevin Conroy is Batman, and Arleen Sorkin is Harley Quinn), but this isn't the cartoon. Harley's wearing a fairly skimpy outfit that shows off her lady parts, Poison Ivy's in some painted-on panties, colorful language like ""♥♥♥♥♥quot; and ""♥♥♥♥♥"" is peppered in, and there are people getting murdered left and right. Arkham itself is a dark and dingy place that just had every psychopath housed there run through the halls tearing the building apart. Dead guards are laid out on the floor, papers are strewn about, and the facilities have seen better days.These adult themes tied in with a very, very Batman-looking world really drive home your connection to the story. I don't think I'm ever going to forget Mr. Zsasz holding a knife to a female doctor, her screaming for me to save her, the Joker screaming at Zsasz to kill her, and Zsasz screaming at me to stay back. After years of the Riddler being goofy, I realized Arkham's version of the character was on a different level when he told a Riddle that ended in dismembering a baby. Plus, the segments where you're under the Scarecrow's influence and Batman's worst fears are realized are some of the coolest, most cerebral parts of the game. These are the moments that wrapped me up in the experience and made me feel like Batman on the longest night of his life.Gameplay in this dark, creepy world breaks down into three main portions -- fist fighting, attacking from the shadows, and exploration. As you move from room to room chasing Harley or Commissioner Gordon's kidnapper, you're going to run into bad guys. Lots of times, you'll find a crew milling about or the Joker will spring a trap with handfuls of guys who are ready to kill you. This is when you'll make use of your straight hand-to-hand moves.Fist fighting in Arkham Asylum is pretty much the definition of an easy to learn/hard to master combat system. The game allows Batman to move faster than his enemies (He's a trained ninja, people!) and engage them in 360 degrees. You just point your left stick towards whatever enemy you want to attack and Batman follows suit. Through four buttons -- strike, reverse, jump, and stun -- you'll unleash Mr. Wayne's fury on the scum of the Earth. Obviously, you can just mash the strike button and take down the bad guys with a healthy set of animations -- dropkicks, elbows, punches, and more are peppered in -- and reverse when you see the spider-sense icon pop-up above a bad guy's head, but there's a sweet science to this madness.

												It's hard to find any flaws in Arkham Asylum.  It's a solid action/adventure game that is very successful in making the player feel like they are Batman.  This is something just about every Batman game released before Arkham Asylum failed to do.  It manages to achieve this through a perfect combat system that allows you to utilise gadgets while throwing enemies around.  I couldn't find any faults in the control system or combat mechanics.  The game offers fantastic voice acting, great graphics, enjoyable story, an upgrade system that flows well with the story, the combination of puzzle and stealth elements.  Then when you are finished with the story, you can spend time collecting trophies within the game.  Collecting these trophies never even felt like a chore.  You can then test your combat skills in the challenge section, as well as your stealth instincts in the predator challenge section.  You have plenty to discover in the game, with many villains making appearances, full bios, hidden recordings, riddler trophies and many hidden areas within the map.  If you combine everything I have mentioned, you have an unforgettable experience and a game that is quite possible (at the time of writing) the best comic game ever made.			"

												Surprisingly good game. I wasn't interested at first, but it turned out to be one I'll never forget. Think something inbetween God of War and Hitman, only with Batman as the main character and a backstory for everyone you encounter, even meaningless NPCs. The climate and voice acting is exceptional, it looks much better than your average unreal engine game.What surprised me the most was the sheer amount of extra content: character summaries, challenges, every batman costume you could think of in 3d, galleries, the riddler taunting you to find his hidden packages... it never stops.Whether or not you like/know anything about the bat, this game is an absolute must, especially when you can find it for £2.50 at a Tesco discount.

												Even tough it took me ages to get this game as I was unsure about getting the batman games, I am a Batman fan. after buying the game on steam from the steam sales, I was hooked every hour of everyday, the story line was fantastic and the use of character and scripting was out of this world, the combat system and gadget you will be sat there for days as you have so much to do on this game. from story mode, challenges, and for those you like the Riddler you'll be outstanded by the genius and cunning games that await for you in the Asylum. I would highly recommend this is to ANYONE!!. if your not even a batman fan, this game has it all and for those you like Harley ;) you'll be in for one smoking hot surprise lol.overall this game is a 9.5/10 for Graphics, Stroyline, Gaming system and concept art.without a doubt one of my top 10 favourite games in my steam profile.

												It's Batman. Just shut up and get it.Just Kidding, Okay where do I start. Firstly, the graphics, just stunning. I know it came out few years back, but it is still stunning. The best part about this game is the gameplay and the story. It gives us the freedom to be a HERO, nono SUPERHERO. The combat style, the weapon(I know this ""Mr Good Guy"" doesn't use gun but he still have tons of cool tool which I see it as weapons), the freedom to take down an enemy the way you want, and just all of it, just just its like all of your childhood dreams in one game. Gameplay- 10/10 You will fall in love with the gameplay (But some may say playing with controller is better where it allows them more flexibility for getting higher combo, but that's more to peoples preference)Story- 10/10 It will explains the story of Batman and few other Vilians from how to who they are now. The plots are amazing. Graphics- 9.5/10 I admit its been years, but if you play the game it is still a beauty and you wont even believe that this game came out few years ago.Overall-9.5/10 The best Superhero game ever.

												One of the best games of its time. SO much to do in this game. We can start by saying YOU ARE THE ***-****ED BATMAN! It makes you feel like batman for sure. I walked around for days speaking in a gravelly voice, saying nothing but ""I'm Batman"". First off, the cinematic entrance and cutscenes are pure movie quality and totally get you into the immersion. Fighting is SO intuitive on computer! You CAN finesse it for sure...or you can just button mash most of it and win. And that's equally as fun and rewarding. At least until it gets harder toward the end. Then it takes more accuracy in moves and hits. The skill advancement system is topnotch. The game constantly rewrads you for progressing by giving you more and more toys to play with and more and more supermoves. And what's cool is that it is TOTALLY UP TO YOU what you spend your upgrades on. So if you want to get a zipline now, do so. You wanna pull down walls NOW okay. You want super armor. GIMME IT NOW. You want more batarangs. OKAY! So it let's you upgrade how you want to custom the gameplay toward how you want to play. I like the basic fighting but what I really like to do is obsessive-compulsively collect things. So this game was SO for me. You have to collect all the riddler trophies which are hidden in secret tough to get to spots. THis can mean figuring out how to get to them. Can also mean pulling walls down. Can also mean ...well you get the idea. You can also kill ALL the joker teeth you see. You can also find ALL the secret scarab plaques and listen to alfredlike voice drone on...you can also find all of the recordings about the Batvillains there are. You can also solve all of riddlers riddles. There is SO MUCH STUFF in this game to do. And there are nice maps you can find in each area to help you keep track of approzimately where the remainers are. And boy....the moves. Grappling up to high building ledges is SO wonderful. Beast feeling though is running off the side of a tall building and gliding forever through the night breeze, moon on your wings. Or swinging from gargoyle to gargoyle, then dropping and enveloping some thug below you and hanging him up. You FELL LIKE BATMAN in every inch of this game. Actually the feeling of this game is how I felt wandering about the world of Thief: the Dark Project by Eidos. That same kind of ""solve the missions, upgrade how you want, wander around the world how you want, do things in the order you want in a mission, freeplay in this world"" way. And the voice acting is topnotch. If there's any game I'd give a 10 it's this one. I guess my only criticism is the boss battles, though I don't really like boss battles in any game. They boil down to figure out why you are dying repeatedly. Find the move that keeps you from dying for a few seconds...then try the next move , etc rinse repeat until you figure out how to do damage...then grind through trying to do that until you kill the boss...suffering through dying 100 times. Yeah. Not EVERY boss fight is like that but there are a few doozies that made me give up for a long while. But really...this is a totally immersive and rewarding experience on many levels. What games should strive for. "

												I'm not one for superhero games, in fact, I don't really care much for superheroes in general. I'm a hipster, I like Spawn! But that's beside the point. Batman Arkham Asylum is beat-em'-up kind of game that moreso tests your reaction timing and ability to adapt moreso than actually beating up the enemies compared to Bayonetta or Devil May Cry. The music is a little on the bland side, its pretty generic.PROS- Arkham Asylum stands out as a game with a simple and easy combat system, terrific voice acting, a decent story, and level design (that more or less infuriates me in how confusing it is sometimes).- Excellent character portrayal, Joker is meant to be crazy while Batman is a brooding intellectual type, and boy, did they nailed it. If you're a big fan of the Batman universe, then you're definitely in for a treat. I'm not, but I still enjoyed it.- A small island with a giant♥♥♥♥♥and needlessly complicated facility  to explore, there's not much to explore, but its there. To, uh, you know, explore. - The Arkham series is the best game to try and make you feel like the Batman, and it does a pretty good job at doing that.CONS- Puzzles! Puzzles! Depending if you love 'em or hate 'em, its pretty well done here. Except the Riddler, that's kind of more annoying and tedious than anything else. The Riddler's riddles are well done, but the trophy collecting...ugh, remove that and I'd slap this as a pro.- Joker gets caught by Batman, Batman puts Joker in prison, Joker has a plan to break out, Batman screwed up, Joker is free,  Batman tries to stop Joker. This is your typical Batman vs Joker relationship that has been going for decades. Its nothing new, its just normal at this point and it'll never change. Mainly because Batman is against killing people. - For the Batman, you aren't very equipped at the very start to tackle much of anything, its a little sad, considering Batman is supposed to always come prepared for any kind of situations. I'm aware its more for not overwhelming the player all at once, but when its necessary to have those gadget upgrades to go back and hunt Riddler trophies, backtracking becomes a chore to scavenger hunt for those.A very good game that withstood the test of time, most games created during the seventrh generation looks very bad when you go back to it, but not this one! No sir, this game is definitely a good pickup, even if you're not a Batman fan like me.			"

												Batman AA is just a great game with very few flaws if any. I played it on the 360 and then got it for the PC to play it again. The gameplay is great combat is fluid. It also mixes together stealth objectives where you have to observe your surroundings before going in and trying to take guys down. The story is also really good with quality voice acting (you just can't beat Mark Hamill as the voice of the Joker). You don’t even need to be a really big Batman fan to enjoy this game, it is by far one of if not the best superhero game out there.			"

												Arkham's magnum opus (so far). Recognise but put aside the crisp combat and the fascinating villains. Making the setting a small, secluded island was the best decision they made. This linear approach meant they could make Batman the focal point rather than the world around him. The game simply made you feel like Batman with an agenda through its straightforwardness. Being devoid of trivial distractions like overly elaborate riddler challenges, ringing phone chases, frustrating AR training and silly ballon hunting only aided the game. Less is more in this instance. The definitive comic book superhero game.			"

												Whether you're a fan of Batman or not, this action-packed yet stealth encompassing game ticks all the boxes on how to make a top-end action game and is a must play. Although the game isn't terribly long, the added challenge mode gives you addictive mini-game style content and Riddler's challenges will give you a run for your money; as long as you don't YouTube all the answers!9/10Pros/Cons+ The fluid combat and stealth systems offer large variety and enjoyment throughout the game.+ The storyline is gripping and holds a lot of in-depth lore to Arkham and it's villains.+ Visuals hold the perfect balance between comic book like and realistic with audio topping it off.+ The dark comedic forefront of the game is complimented well by the serious backdrop of the story. - This game has a somewhat short storyline given its limited online game types available.

(From gadgets to his fighting moves, his enemies)Combos and fighting system is great.Stealth system is the best and it's not broken.Trophy to find and the questions made by the enigimist are really hard.Challenge modes is fun (Really hard challanges)Arkham Asylum just as in the comic, and well done.CONS:Really tiny map. (The game is free-roam after you completed it, but most of the time you will be inside the builidings)Not for Batman fans. (You might wanna buy it if you read the comics or you have some friends who can tells you about his enemies)You can't play as Joker in the PC version.There's no really replay value. (Maybe you can play the story in hard mode after you get every challenge done and found every trophy)8.5/10 I wish they would add more bad guys and the story was longer just like Arkham City, but for 20 euro or less it's worth it.

												I'm going to say I recommend this game because it wasn't unpleasant, but I wouldn't say it was great.... I'd give it about a 65/100. I'm going to post a lot of criticism, because the flaws stand out pretty boldly, but overall it was OKThe controls are wonky at best... IT's a fairly clumsy console port. A lot of quicktime-style events, and lots of stupid things where, for example, if you always had to hit D to move left, all of a sudden you have to hit S to move left. Perhaps it works with the D-pad on consoles, but in this it was clunkyThe fighting is just button mashing. If you fail, try again but mash your buttons a little faster.All of the moves after that are script punches, kicks and flips. THere are some ""power moves"" too but since they keep your character busy in an animation for a while, it just gives your enemies time to take you out.In combat there's supposedly a 'counter' option so you can counter a move, but I would jam on the button for it and nothing would happen. Doesn't matter though, I played through the game on normal difficulty without it.Almost all of the boss fights are exactly the same thing... you fight a couple muscle men who charge at you and swing your arms.There's a ton of fan service but it's terribly forced. The voice acting is b-grade at best and the characters are unconvincingIf you want a similar game, with an open world where you pick up upgraded♥♥♥♥♥♥as you go, play Tomb Raider instead. Better everything. If you've played that and you're looking for something more, play this. "

												Not a very long game (about 15 hours), but very entertaining, and very polished.You can really sense that the developers simply love the comics. Everything is just right: Batman uses his brains, stealth, and gadgets as much as his brawn; he never kills; the villains all act according to their various demented personalities; and Arkham Asylum is full of little nods to many, many characters from the comics.The gamish aspects are just as polished. The controls (I used a gamepad) are smooth, the graphics are nice, the action (especially the many boss fights) is often challenging but rarely frustrating.If you like Batman and are looking for an action game, then you can't go wrong with this one.

I kind of wish you could use some of the weapons that drop more like guns but since you can do that in a lot of other games it's so bad playing one without that feature.  Seems to have a pretty good story and nice combat mechanics although it might be tricky for a while to get a real high chain combo.

The game itself plays beautifuly whether you're a fan of stealth like combot, or all out punch em' up! Throughout Batman Arkham Asylum, the game takes a diverse approach to multiple bosses and tackling through different enemies. The bosses are generally all character from the Batman comics and tv shows/ movies eg: Bane or Killer Croc.You will litterally spend hours upon hours attempting to solve all of the hidden riddles and secrets in this game, and on console, i absoloutly love doing it. However, the game has its stupid minor flaws, but they are nothing to be concerned about, or put you off playing this. All in all, I would highly reccomend this game to any fan of the Batman Series!8.5/10.			"

												First game in the Batman series and it's very wellmade. The story is immense and there's just so much around it. Interviews, background stories and much more.Graphics are good, combat system is good and overall the game is easily one of the best Batman games to date. I finished it in around 11 hours by just doing the story, but there's enough challenges and secrets to last another 10-20 hours easily.So any negatives? The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ unreal engine as well as console base means you can't change sensitivity unless you change it in the config file manually. Also 2 of the bossfights were made with a console controller in mind which is also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cause when you play it on a PC it ruins the experience. Imagine playing the game for 10 hours in one way, then you're forced to do a 5 minute fight with the opposite controls. It's doable, but frustrating.Other than those two flaws, I'd class this game a straight 10 and very enjoyable. "

												Still the best Batman game in the Arkham series and probably the best Batman game ever made. The story involves Batman catching Joker easily after a recent robbery and, coincidentally, Joker's gang moved to the Asylum because of an issue at the Blackgate Prison - once inside the Asylum, the Joker escapes and taskes control of the Asylum and prepares to unearth something far worse than what you initially suspect. You play as Batman trying to unearth this plot and once again stop the Joker.To this day, this game still has amazing visuals, Batman himself covering around half the screen, looks the part and stands strong and confident as the character should as well as the texture work on his suit are top notch - the rest of the game fairs the same, since the game has been given an outstanding amount of care and work into every area you go through. Not one area in the game feels exactly the same as another even if they look similar. Very stellar work of textures all around overall.I don't say this is the best Batman game out there for no reason - gameplay is pretty basic ""Brawler"" style with very minor puzzle solving, but what makes this game different, from, say a game like Assassin's Creed - is the ""Free Flow combat system"" the game has. The combat is slightly similar to the first Assassin's Creed, except - the flow combat system allows Batman to basically jump from one foe to another in a very fast manner, almost rythmically, to get a combo counter to go as high as you can while still making it challenging by giving the foes still standing a fighting chance and implementing counters. You can also explore the entirety of the Arkham Asylum as you unlock areas and you can do a variety of things while exploring, you can face groups of enemies scattered around, you can do Riddler Challenges - whom are a bunch of mini puzzles scattered around the Asylum that involves the use of Batman's Detective Mode, these range from finding a specific item found in the area or marks that require the Detective Mode to find and a ""Complete the Mark"" type of game that involves you scanning the area from specific places to complete a full mark, etc - Riddler trophies, and a bunch of case files to find out more background information on Batman characters and villains (as well as the history behind Arkahm Asylum) that are often very well realized and fun to hear. The Detective Mode & Gadgets: You'll be using these a LOT on your trudge through Arkham Asylum. Ranging from the standard Batarangs and Grappling hook (used for mundane objectives such as getting to and pulling out vents from hard to reach places, etc), the Explosive Gel (Used a lot to surprise enemies, to find weak walls to find trophies and secrets and to progress in the story as well!) and a bunch more. The Detecive Mode helps you analyze weak walls to use your Explosive Gel on and other gadgets as well as analyze enemy/allies conditions and, more important later on in the game, to find out which enemies carry weapons or are special enemies.).So in general, if you ever wanted to know and feel what a life in the day of Batman is, this is definately your game, more so than the sequels (imo). From the excellent assets and sound to follow it up with, and the pitch perfect gameplay to go along with it, this sits as one of my favourite video game experiences and currently my best experience playing as the legendary Dark Knight.

												Great game.  You have do a good bit of backtracking after you get certain gadgets, which is slightly confusing to keep up with but not too bad.  I kind of wish you could use some of the weapons that drop more like guns but since you can do that in a lot of other games it's so bad playing one without that feature.  Seems to have a pretty good story and nice combat mechanics although it might be tricky for a while to get a real high chain combo.  All in All it's a really great game with excellent voice acting and better then the last 3 dark knight movies combined.			"

												Well, I finally played Arkham Asylum, and I'll be damned if that isn't the great video game adaptation of the Batman cartoon from the 90s. We have the most important VAs (Kevin Conroy as Batman and Mark Hamil as The Joker), we have a gloomy to creepy atmosphere, and we have a goofy but well-written plot that is dark only for specific values of dark. And that's where it lost me.See, I really like Arkham Asylum: A Serious House On Serious Earth. It's a solid graphic novel with gorgeous, disturbing art and a really interesting set of villains. I love Joker's motivation, to prove to Batman that he is just as crazy as his adversaries and belongs in Arkham right beside them. I love the concept of an Arkham doctor as a malefactor who turns Two-Face into a useless wreck. The game has hints of parts of fragments of the ideas which make the graphic novel so awesome.But it's not fair to judge the game as an adaptation of the graphic novel it's named for, no matter how much the opening credit sequence built my hopes up for a Joker who was as clever as he was wacky.On its own terms, the game is a great adaptation of the 90s Batman cartoon. It feels like it was written by the same team. The character designs range from solid to fantastic, with Scarecrow being a particular standout. The locations are gorgeous and grimy, laid out by a madman who no doubt had Amadeus Arkham and his madness in mind. All of the signs, the lighting, the color palettes come straight out of the 90s cartoon. In terms of gameplay, Arkham Asylum is polished and smooth. The freeflow combat system has that balance of easy to learn/hard to master. The predator missions are unique and enjoyable, compelling the player to find new and different ways to prowl and hunt. Games with an open world element depend on character mobility, and getting Batman where you want him is a satisfying affair. Remarkable, no, but satisfying. The only fault I can make note of in terms of gameplay is the boss fights. The first true boss is satisfying and fun, but using that same mechanic in half the big fight scenes in the game? It rubbed me wrong, though that's a matter of taste. What I consider pretty much unforgivable is using a glorified mook rush as the final boss fight.Overall, I enjoyed the gameplay in Arkham Asylum. The freeflow fighting system has more than taken off in the years since it came out, and the predator sequences are steath combat done well. It's a visually stunning game with great character design and solid, consistent writing. But at the end of the day, I feel like I missed out on something with this. I feel like I'm either too old or not in tune with the nostalgia frequency this game is broadcasting. It's a blast from someone else's childhood. I hope it's yours.			"

												The first game in which you actually feel like Batman. Wonderful stealth gameplay, fluid and awe-inspiring free-flow combat sections and an amazing story. Mark Hamill is fantastic as the Joker, and I would dare say he is better than both Ledger and Nicholson! Only complaints I have are that I personally felt that the game wasn't very replayable and also the final boss battle is rather anti-climactic.			"

												THis is game is not only revolutionary in its time but it also paves the way for people to get serious when converting comics to videogames and Batman is no acception . Being a Detective Vigilante aint easy but who says being the godamn Batman is easy . Batman is out hunting down all of Arkham Asylums worse villians with the Joker as its main croony . You'll glide , sneak into tight spaces , zipline , go stealth , fight bad guys , solve mysteries and best of all be BATMAN . Theres no other way you can skip this experience for along time			"

												A surprising and welcome contradiction to the notion that all film-based video games are inherently terrible. Particularly graphic intensive for its time, but it does not skimp out on content by any means. The game has plenty of lore, encounters from many classic villains, and relatively fluid controls and combat options. The game lends itself more toward stealth combat, which fits Batman's persona entirely well.Very much a worthy purchase.			"

												This game is AMAZING. Definitely one of the most fun thrid person story based games I have ever played. The storyline is fantastic, the characters are taken straight out of the comic universe so of course that is fantastic, and most importantly, the gameplay is fantastic. Even though it feels like the combat would get repetitive, it just doesn't because there is a perfect blend of environment variety and equiptment pacing. Almost every little thing you can think of feels like it was placed there for a specific game design reason, whether it be the guards standing position, or a little cupboard to hide behind. You generally cycle through different types of gameplay, from brawling, to stealth, to platforming, to pure epic boss fights.I particularly love the encounters with the scarecrow because it really shakes up the gameplay with a completely different camera perspective, and a branched off story about bruce wayne's past. While I usually have too much anxiety to play games with dark settings (like bioshock or deadspace), the game really makes me feel like I am batman and am the hunter not the hunted. I cannot reccomend this game more.			"

												I originally looked at this game and thought... ahh it's just a beat em up type thing, not really my sort of thing. I picked it up in a recent humble bundle and I was pleasantly surprised. The voice acting is great (ofc) and the storyline is passable. You have the freedom to roam all over Arkham's island exploring the various parts of the asylum. The combat is very well done and you often have the option to sneak up and take things out if you prefer stealth over brute force although it has to be said once you have the hang of thumping people you may not want to give it up. It shifts into a fixed perspective for some areas and bosses which caused my other half huge problems when he played. It seemed to play well regardless of whether you chose keyboard and mouse or controller as an input device although it was annoying not being able to redefine keys without exiting the game. There are a ton of collectible items scattered throughout that unlock backstory and extra information and a large quantity of fighting and steath challenges that are unlocked as you progress through the game.All in all it's a well fleshed out game with plenty to keep you hooked regardless of what aspects you enjoy.

The story is good and graphics are nice for my standard. The views are awesome, for example when you stand on top of a hill and you can see island, moonlight and ocean beneath you, it is really nice. Joker! Oh my God, Joker is awesome! For me he is, maybe, the best one till this date. Action is pretty straightforward, you easily get used to it, but it is fun to plan every move you need to take. But I will not spoil this for you, buy it and enjoy it!			"

You don't have to know jack♥♥♥♥♥♥about Batman for this game to be awesome and now that I finished this one I have high hopes for the sequel. The Joker character was amazing, and the bosses in the game felt challenging and I actually just didn't feel like the bosses were there just as a filler for parts in the game. They weren't just extended regular enemies either, they were actually bosses. This game did a really good job with everything it tried to do. Even the riddles that they had around the island and the Riddler constantly mocking you and such for not finding a riddle or finding one. I grew a hate for the guy without even seeing him once in the entire game. This game is a must have for people looking for a arcade style beat em' up with a great story. 10/10.			"

												This is an excellent game. There's an insane amount of detail throughout it pertaining to a large assortment of characters, including villain hideouts and interview tapes, as well as a progressively dark dialog from Amadeus Arkham. If you're not into truly ""completing"" a game, the main story alone is still fantastic and very fun to play through. The combat is fluid and satisfying, and there are several ways to approach clearing a room--stealthily, from above, with explosives...however you want. If you're at all a Batman fan this is a must-play in my opinion.			"

												Batman: Arkham Asylum was the best action game of 2009.  I originally played this game on Xbox 360, but revisited the PC version and enjoyed it again even more with crisper graphics.  While the game does have some beat 'em up elements to it, it won't tire you out on them.  Though, if you do enjoy them, like I did, the game offers a challenge mode that lets you enjoy the wonderful contextual combo system.  Much of the appeal is the puzzle-like approach to clearing a room, or getting to your next objective by sticking to the shadows and using the fear tactics that Batman is known for.  The story is compelling, and the gameplay offers just enough variety to keep it from feeling bland.  There is a pleasant mixture of brawling, stealth action, story sequences, and detective work to keep your attention.If you haven't yet played Batman: Arkham Asylum, I would highly recommend the PC version using either mouse/keyboard or a 360 game controller, especially before the sequel arrives!

												Awesome 3rd person, action, adventure game. Very rich story and character design, with your favorite heroes and villains, as well as incredibly fluid close combat system. Great animation and voice acting. A lot of cinematic cut scenes, boss fights, humor and asss kicking. Has somewhat open world feel with a lot of interior and exterior areas and rich environments. A lot of gadgets and combat moves to chose from, to reign the justice on the bad guys.			"

The fighting is unique and the combos are fun. Yes, its linear, but THATS A GOOD THING! You move though an animated batman movie. Love it. Worth $20 easy. Though I only paid a quarter of that :)			"

												Arkham Asylum presents a fun experience based off the comic book series. As a whole, this game is comparable to The Dark Knight in terms of quality story, art, and cinematics. The storyline is a series of twists and turns as Batman has to stop Joker while facing off against other supervillains in order to reach Joker. The game is set on Arkham Island both inside the asylum and on the outside grounds. Batman has to fight, sneak, solve, and explore his way using various different actions in the game. As a result, there's a bunch of action and solving gameplay rolled into one. Graphically, the game looks realistic and dark while retaining the comic book quality of each character. Some characters look noticably huge while others have a slimmer trim. The music matches the serious tone well by applying the tenseness of the situation. Batman: Arkham Asylum provides a good blend of comic book storytelling with the multiple playstyles and enveloping graphics and music to the feel of the comics.			"

												Great story line, Awesome combat, and most importantly Batman. This game is by far one of the best games I've ever played. Its story takes you through out the expansive Arkham Asylum Island, getting to explore ever cell, every medical ward, all of it.      Have you ever wondered how Batman jumps out of the shadows to take down thugs and then disappears before anyone saw what happened, this game gives you a first hand look at all of his tricks. The combat sequences are a personal favorite, getting to bust out some of the Dark Knight's combat training is just plain fun and cool to watch. There's some swearing and inappropriate suggestions so I wouldn't suggest it to any under 12 or 13.In short, twenty bucks for this is a steal.			"

												Pretty much interesting game if you got from the humblebundle or any other discount.It's by far a well done game, scenaries are made in a surprising way and your gadgets will change the way u see it in every single moment.Combat can turn boring while most bosses are just adds and hide & hit, and some other stealth areas will burn your time while you try to hunt your enemies. More strategy would be welcome at all, and (SPOILER) final encounters are pretty dissapointing, specially the last one, which is just adds adds and more adds (FINAL OF THE SPOILER).As I said, a very good choice if you have a nice discount, but wouln't pay much for that game i guess.

Soviet's Fast ReviewsVisuals+ Graphics look smooth and have decent amount of texture detail+ Animations of characters and combat are fluid and look organic- Certain areas have flat textures- The game is often too dark and some things blend into each otherGameplay+ Controls feel solid and performing combo moves is fairly easy+ Glide mechanic and gadgets are fun to use and feel solid- Some of the voice acting feels stiff and doesn't really fit the situation at certain moments- Missions are all over the place and can be tedious to run between buildingsOverallBatman Arkham Asylum throws you right into the eyes of Bruce Wayne/Batman as he transports the Joker to the criminal institution known as Arkham Asylum. The story is quite rich and introduces various characters from the comic books as well as some pretty cool features like the Detective Mode which lets you see the enemies through walls, items hidden in cracks, and switches to activate. Combat is smooth, though the limited combo list can make the constant fight sequences seem a bit tedious. Despite its age and the launch of other sequels, Arkham Asylum is still very fun to play and the story is definitely one of the best of any franchise to date. If you're looking for a great superhero title, check Arkham Asylum on your list of games to purchase.			"

												This game is AMAZING. Definitely one of the most fun thrid person story based games I have ever played. The storyline is fantastic, the characters are taken straight out of the comic universe so of course that is fantastic, and most importantly, the gameplay is fantastic. Even though it feels like the combat would get repetitive, it just doesn't because there is a perfect blend of environment variety and equiptment pacing. Almost every little thing you can think of feels like it was placed there for a specific game design reason, whether it be the guards standing position, or a little cupboard to hide behind. You generally cycle through different types of gameplay, from brawling, to stealth, to platforming, to pure epic boss fights.I particularly love the encounters with the scarecrow because it really shakes up the gameplay with a completely different camera perspective, and a branched off story about bruce wayne's past. While I usually have too much anxiety to play games with dark settings (like bioshock or deadspace), the game really makes me feel like I am batman and am the hunter not the hunted. I cannot reccomend this game more.			"

												I originally looked at this game and thought... ahh it's just a beat em up type thing, not really my sort of thing. I picked it up in a recent humble bundle and I was pleasantly surprised. The voice acting is great (ofc) and the storyline is passable. You have the freedom to roam all over Arkham's island exploring the various parts of the asylum. The combat is very well done and you often have the option to sneak up and take things out if you prefer stealth over brute force although it has to be said once you have the hang of thumping people you may not want to give it up. It shifts into a fixed perspective for some areas and bosses which caused my other half huge problems when he played. It seemed to play well regardless of whether you chose keyboard and mouse or controller as an input device although it was annoying not being able to redefine keys without exiting the game. There are a ton of collectible items scattered throughout that unlock backstory and extra information and a large quantity of fighting and steath challenges that are unlocked as you progress through the game.All in all it's a well fleshed out game with plenty to keep you hooked regardless of what aspects you enjoy.

												PROS:You will feel playing like Batman. (From gadgets to his fighting moves, his enemies)Combos and fighting system is great.Stealth system is the best and it's not broken.Trophy to find and the questions made by the enigimist are really hard.Challenge modes is fun (Really hard challanges)Arkham Asylum just as in the comic, and well done.CONS:Really tiny map. (The game is free-roam after you completed it, but most of the time you will be inside the builidings)Not for Batman fans. (You might wanna buy it if you read the comics or you have some friends who can tells you about his enemies)You can't play as Joker in the PC version.There's no really replay value. (Maybe you can play the story in hard mode after you get every challenge done and found every trophy)8.5/10 I wish they would add more bad guys and the story was longer just like Arkham City, but for 20 euro or less it's worth it.

												Whether you're a fan of Batman or not, this action-packed yet stealth encompassing game ticks all the boxes on how to make a top-end action game and is a must play. Although the game isn't terribly long, the added challenge mode gives you addictive mini-game style content and Riddler's challenges will give you a run for your money; as long as you don't YouTube all the answers!9/10Pros/Cons+ The fluid combat and stealth systems offer large variety and enjoyment throughout the game.+ The storyline is gripping and holds a lot of in-depth lore to Arkham and it's villains.+ Visuals hold the perfect balance between comic book like and realistic with audio topping it off.+ The dark comedic forefront of the game is complimented well by the serious backdrop of the story. - This game has a somewhat short storyline given its limited online game types available.

The game has a lot of lore you can discover about the specific characters in Gotham.The game has a great free flow combat system: easy to learn, yet difficult to master.You'll be constantly switching from beating up a bunch of criminals in the open to being stealthy and trying to take out armed criminals with your gadgets.There's a lot of collectibles in this game ranging from trophies to audio tapes of some of the most deranged criminals of Gotham.The visuals are stunning even if the game itself is half a decade old; there's a lot of great atmosphere, even making some parts ""scary"".The achievements aren't ridiculously hard either; you'll be playing this game for a while if you decide to go 100%, which I highly recommend to everyone.Overall, this game is a must get especially when it goes on sale.

It's not difficult but it is very engaging!Story is solid, the writers were on the ball and the game is packed with so many side-stories and mini-plots that you are drawn in and held there.Graphics, this game might be slightly old but it puts a lot of games to shame with the sheer beauty of it's style.

												Great game based on one of the greatest superheroes of all time--Batman. The combat is immersive; if you ever played Spiderman, the combat mimicks that of Spidey and counter measuring your enemies is very satisfying. Nothing beats dodging and throwing Mike Tyson punches and spin kicks to thugs. Majority of buildings and structures are mountable with your Batlaw to scout areas for enemies or to strategize how to pick them off one-by-one. The latter will apply to situations when there are enemies with machine guns as bullets take a good chunk of Batman's health. Yet this is where it gets fun; you as The Dark Knight can use the Batclaw to mount on a gargoyle and press Y button to hang an unsuspecting thug onto the gargoyle while he screams ""Let me down!"" Others nearby will hear their comrade and rush to him. What do you do? Grapple to the next gargoyle and repeat. You can also take them out silently by sneaking behind them or using certain gadgets. For enemies with only fists and melee weapons, you can just zerg in and counter when necessary. Graphics are amazing as are the movie-like cutscenes. The voice acting is superb. I recommend playing with Physics on. I played with the GTX 295 with Physics set to High and it was outstanding. The game is very fun. Only part what I viewed as tedious was Croc and his lair. Scarecrow was literally creepy and disturbing. Poison Ivy was, well, hot! The final battle to the game's conclusion was a great experience. Simple but challenging. I'm now playing Arkham City. Plan is to play the whole trilogy and Arkham Knight as soon as it releases.			"

The gameplay works great, you'll have access to tons of Batman lore information if you seek every Riddler challenges, the storytelling itself is nice, the Joker is voiced by Mark Hamill, the only thing that might (i dont say it will) disapoint some, is that you'll need approx. twenty hours to get everything, as there is not a lot of side missions compared to the next installment.

Very nice combat system, beautiful and awesome dark atmosphere; as well as stunning and reliable graphic performance (at least, works fine on my laptop).+1 for Game of the Year awards. You should try the sequel, Batman: Arkham City too.			"

												Batman Arkham Asylum is one reason why I like the superhero genre games. The reason being that is that you play as the Dark Knight himself and using his gadgets. The synopsis of the game is Batman captures The Joker and brings him to Arkham Asylum to be kept there, but all along it was a trap as Joker wants to takeover the Asylum for himself. The Joker escapes from his captivity and is on the loose. Now the Greatest Detective has solve this problem by trying to find the Joker within Arkham Asylum and ask him what he really want to do.  The gameplay is amazing with features like Detective Mode which makes you see everything in X-Ray vision but it useful to see if there is any of Joker's Thugs is in the room. The abillty to use the batarang is amazing and to use the Batclaw which can bring down walls. Overall I think that this game is worth a buy if you are a Batman fan or if you like stealth and beat'em up genres.			"

												In a word: playable.Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy this game, but it didn't wow me the way I expected it to. After years of hearing praise for the story, combat system, etc, I decided to give it a try, but I'd say it's only about 40% fun and 60% frustration.Pros:-Decent graphics that still hold up 7 years later.-Good looking designs for Batman's rogues gallery, especially Joker who, looking more like the classic version, was a welcome change from the now stagnant Heath Ledger version everyone was obsessed with at the time.-Believable story (even with the body sized ventilation shafts and conveniently placed gargoyles).-Hearing the voice actors from Batman: TAS was pretty cool.-Cool gadgetsCons:-Navigation was a royal pain. I had to constantly check the map to see where I was going, and backtrack every 5 minutes.-The Riddler challenge is a distracting side quest that I ultimately gave up on.-The fighting mechanics gave me a headache. Countering only worked half the time, and it would constantly go into slow motion, which is hard to control. To be fair, it did set the standard for other combat styles, such as Shadow of Mordor, which requires a bit of strategy but actually works if you know what you're doing. Here, I basically just spend the whole fight clicking and mashing the spacebar, because I'm not in control at all.Overall, I did enjoy it, but I would not put it in my top 5.			"

												If you haven't played this yet you're missing out on something special.3D brawler gameplay that actually works combined with the genuine sensation that you ARE the Batman.  It's got all the qualities we've come to know and love the Dark Knight's ongoing mythology for, with a decent roster of Gotham's criminally insane lining up to take their shot at the Bat.  The story is beefed up with an excellent script and voice acting fit for the ages.  Mark Hamill's out-of-the-box psychotic Joker brings a wry smile to your face with every one-liner.Arkham Asylum's gameplay is semi-immersed in stealth.  Enemies who are armed with guns are dangerous if faced directly, so the game teaches you how to move around and take out foes one by one.  Difficulty is scaled up with the acquisition of more gadgets, so adaptation of new techniques becomes paramount to Batman's survival - as it should be.A special mention is deserved for the game's audio and visual presentation which pump a gritty, suspenseful atmosphere into  the experience.  Arkham Asylum could have easily faultered on these qualities, but it doesn't.    There is really no excuse for you not to have played Arkham Asylum.  Nobody expected it to do what it does with such grace and respect for its source material.  Just buy the bloody thing and play it if you haven't already; you'll soon realise what all the fuss is about.			"

 Click Here for the Full Review! [monthsbehindreviews.blogspot.com]Synopsis: A great game that combines, at about a 2-1 ratio, melee heavy combat with stealth focused areas. Comparing this game to Zelda seems rather apt, as you'll find that you can only explore a portion of a current zone (i.e. dungeon) until you uncover the one key item you need to get to the boss, which will allow you to unlock a bit more of the somewhat open world. Combat is fun, as you deal with multiple enemy types when engaged in melee, requiring you to attack stun baton enemies from behind, knife wielding enemies to be stunned with your cape first, and generally paying attention to which of the dozen enemies you're fighting will be attacking you first. Plenty of collectibles out there is you feel like solving some of the Riddler's puzzles, and while the game is focused on the Joker vs. Batman rivalry, the game does a great job of bringing in a variety of major Batman villains.Expect about 16 hours to get a 100% completion on the story side. I've rated it an 9/10, and recommend picking it up at $10 or less, though you can probably find it at $5 during a major sale.			"

												Arkham Asylum presents a fun experience based off the comic book series. As a whole, this game is comparable to The Dark Knight in terms of quality story, art, and cinematics. The storyline is a series of twists and turns as Batman has to stop Joker while facing off against other supervillains in order to reach Joker. The game is set on Arkham Island both inside the asylum and on the outside grounds. Batman has to fight, sneak, solve, and explore his way using various different actions in the game. As a result, there's a bunch of action and solving gameplay rolled into one. Graphically, the game looks realistic and dark while retaining the comic book quality of each character. Some characters look noticably huge while others have a slimmer trim. The music matches the serious tone well by applying the tenseness of the situation. Batman: Arkham Asylum provides a good blend of comic book storytelling with the multiple playstyles and enveloping graphics and music to the feel of the comics.			"

												First game in the Batman series and it's very wellmade. The story is immense and there's just so much around it. Interviews, background stories and much more.Graphics are good, combat system is good and overall the game is easily one of the best Batman games to date. I finished it in around 11 hours by just doing the story, but there's enough challenges and secrets to last another 10-20 hours easily.So any negatives? The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ unreal engine as well as console base means you can't change sensitivity unless you change it in the config file manually. Also 2 of the bossfights were made with a console controller in mind which is also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cause when you play it on a PC it ruins the experience. Imagine playing the game for 10 hours in one way, then you're forced to do a 5 minute fight with the opposite controls. It's doable, but frustrating.Other than those two flaws, I'd class this game a straight 10 and very enjoyable. "

												Awesome game. I recommend.The story line is nothing spectacular but is entertaining for Batman fans. Even if your not familiarized with the comic book's universe, as you play, the game provides a huge set of informations about chracters that may or may not appear during the game.On one hand, the combat features are incredible. There is a large amount of moves you can do while in a fight, specially if you make big combos. I don't quite know what it is but there is something about the sound it makes when you hit a thug or break his leg that brings that feeling of accomplishment towards the game and makes you play more.On the other hand, the stealth/predator mode lacks the silence and discretion I expected. The takedowns, except for the silent one are very noisy and attract almost all the prisoners to the location where it happened. There are also a lot of features that in the end make the game to easy in that area. The fact that the sonic batarang always attracts one and only one thug so you can take him down is kind of a buzz kill. In addition to that, if you want, you can easily take down three guys at the same time by using the multiple batarang and the ground pound once they are down, what makes the stealth unchallenging.The challenges are a great feature of the game and are nice to play even after you finished the campaing.To sum up, really good game even with small flaws in some areas.

Posted: February 18, 2014
												Well, I finally played Arkham Asylum, and I'll be damned if that isn't the great video game adaptation of the Batman cartoon from the 90s. We have the most important VAs (Kevin Conroy as Batman and Mark Hamil as The Joker), we have a gloomy to creepy atmosphere, and we have a goofy but well-written plot that is dark only for specific values of dark. And that's where it lost me.See, I really like Arkham Asylum: A Serious House On Serious Earth. It's a solid graphic novel with gorgeous, disturbing art and a really interesting set of villains. I love Joker's motivation, to prove to Batman that he is just as crazy as his adversaries and belongs in Arkham right beside them. I love the concept of an Arkham doctor as a malefactor who turns Two-Face into a useless wreck. The game has hints of parts of fragments of the ideas which make the graphic novel so awesome.But it's not fair to judge the game as an adaptation of the graphic novel it's named for, no matter how much the opening credit sequence built my hopes up for a Joker who was as clever as he was wacky.On its own terms, the game is a great adaptation of the 90s Batman cartoon. It feels like it was written by the same team. The character designs range from solid to fantastic, with Scarecrow being a particular standout. The locations are gorgeous and grimy, laid out by a madman who no doubt had Amadeus Arkham and his madness in mind. All of the signs, the lighting, the color palettes come straight out of the 90s cartoon. In terms of gameplay, Arkham Asylum is polished and smooth. The freeflow combat system has that balance of easy to learn/hard to master. The predator missions are unique and enjoyable, compelling the player to find new and different ways to prowl and hunt. Games with an open world element depend on character mobility, and getting Batman where you want him is a satisfying affair. Remarkable, no, but satisfying. The only fault I can make note of in terms of gameplay is the boss fights. The first true boss is satisfying and fun, but using that same mechanic in half the big fight scenes in the game? It rubbed me wrong, though that's a matter of taste. What I consider pretty much unforgivable is using a glorified mook rush as the final boss fight.Overall, I enjoyed the gameplay in Arkham Asylum. The freeflow fighting system has more than taken off in the years since it came out, and the predator sequences are steath combat done well. It's a visually stunning game with great character design and solid, consistent writing. But at the end of the day, I feel like I missed out on something with this. I feel like I'm either too old or not in tune with the nostalgia frequency this game is broadcasting. It's a blast from someone else's childhood. I hope it's yours.			"

												Not a very long game (about 15 hours), but very entertaining, and very polished.You can really sense that the developers simply love the comics. Everything is just right: Batman uses his brains, stealth, and gadgets as much as his brawn; he never kills; the villains all act according to their various demented personalities; and Arkham Asylum is full of little nods to many, many characters from the comics.The gamish aspects are just as polished. The controls (I used a gamepad) are smooth, the graphics are nice, the action (especially the many boss fights) is often challenging but rarely frustrating.If you like Batman and are looking for an action game, then you can't go wrong with this one.

												Story (9/10):Batman: Arkham Asylum is one of the best games I have ever played.  You play, as the title suggests, as *dramatic pause* Batman!  Armed with many iconic gadgets like the batarang, grapple, smoke bombs, and many more, it is your mission to put a stop to the Joker's plans within the Asylum.The story is exciting, and unique.  As you progress, you must adapt and master new skills as objectives become more difficult to complete.  Iconic characters will make appearances as you progress.  Most will try to kill you, some will try to pull a fast one and try to backstab you, still one in particular will even try to eat you.  You will be in danger from start to finish, captivated by the eerie environment and developing story.Visuals (10/10):Arkham Asylum is a bit dated now, so the graphics are not considered as stunning as they once were.  However, maxed out, it still looks very good.  The asylum is true to its comic book origins, meaning it is dark, depressing, and gives off the feeling that something more sinister is lurking behind the walls than just the criminally insane.Gameplay (10/10):The world of Arkham Asylum is free exploration, but to stay interested and invested in the game, you can't really deviate from the story because the story is linear and without side missions to distract you.  Personally, I am not bothered by this because there is quite a bit of problem solving and each area you enter presents a new challenge that require different approaches, so you aren't doing the same thing over and over.The main story is fairly long probably about 15 to 20 hours depending on the difficulty.  On top of that, you have a couple of miscellaneous “missions” like doing all of the Riddler Challenges and examing the artifacts found in the Asylum.  While many find these boring, I personally enjoyed going back and doing these because they offered sereral easter eggs by referencing events and characters from the comics that I enjoyed.  If this isn't your kind of thing, it is easily skipped.This game is in third person, so it relies on a very effective free-flow combat system based on combos.  It mixes classic fighting with silent takedowns and special combo moves that create the classic Batman that can take anyone in a fight.  Included in the fighting system are the gadgets.  The gadgets create a whole new host of ways to creatively finish off opponets in both direct and indirect combat.  Many complain about the fact that the Batmobile and Batwing are not present in the game except for short stints, and are not even player operated.  While this is unfortunate, the nature of the game taking place inside a small, finite area really defeats the use of either one. Sound (8/10):In terms of music and sound effects, Arkham Ayslum employs them to great effect.  While the soundtrack isn’t really memorable, the small things like dripping water, metal clanking against metal, and other small things add to the immersion.  The environmental and combat sounds are actually quite good.  Unfortunately the dialogs are hit or miss, which sometimes hurts the characters.Replay value (9/10):While the plot is linear and there aren't any choices which would change the story in any way, the game provides countless hours of fun as probably the best batman simulator on the market.  If the story mode gets boring, there are always the numerous challenge missions that are not part of the story that are fun to play.Conclusion (9.2/10):Batman: Arkham Asylum is a very good game, with an unforgettable setting, an engaging plot, and a loose ends that set up future games.  Overall, it is definitely one of those games which you have to play at least once and I highly recommend it.			"

												God............ I remember waiting for this game. I was like a junkie on the edios forums, just waitinf ofr new info and speculations. I just wanted a Batman game in todays graphics, i didnt even care if it will be good, in my eyes it was gonna have to do. What we got........ was the sleeper hit of 2009. NO. GOTY of 2009. The game that broke the super hero curse. An amaing game. The mechanics, graphics and story ill forever hold up, even in 50 years. No one will look at this experience and say: That is too dated for me to enjoy it. No one. It is an instant classic then, and one with a legacy for decades to come. A masterpice of the Video game form. This game has made alot of casual fans, into Batman fans. Even if not a fan, the source material is irrelevant to your enjoyment. You can not go wrong with this one. Well, for a single player storytelling game that is. The few friends that do not like it, do not like the genre at all. The online competitive crowd, for them i understand. They can not experience it. But for the rest of us. Let us visit, an  revisit, and revisit Arkham when we  need a trip to the madhouse.			"

												I had purchased this a LONG time ago and let it sit around while I was playing other things. I've really regret doing that. This is such an amazingly fantastic game that you will not want to put it down.The voice acting is second to none, you got the stellar Kevin Conroy (whom you may know from the Justice League / Unlimited cartoons) voicing Batman, and Mark Hamill as the Joker as the main protagonist and antagonist. Harley Quinn also makes an appearance in an outfit you won't soon forget, as well as a number of other key Batman villains with varying purposes and roles.The combat system is immensely satisfying, as you level your character up, you gain more techniques to use against enemies (whom you can fight upwards of 8-13 in some instances) and they are all quite useful once you get them into your routine.I cannot recommend this game highly enough, what an amazing Batman game this turned out to be!

												I'm going to say I recommend this game because it wasn't unpleasant, but I wouldn't say it was great.... I'd give it about a 65/100. I'm going to post a lot of criticism, because the flaws stand out pretty boldly, but overall it was OKThe controls are wonky at best... IT's a fairly clumsy console port. A lot of quicktime-style events, and lots of stupid things where, for example, if you always had to hit D to move left, all of a sudden you have to hit S to move left. Perhaps it works with the D-pad on consoles, but in this it was clunkyThe fighting is just button mashing. If you fail, try again but mash your buttons a little faster.All of the moves after that are script punches, kicks and flips. THere are some ""power moves"" too but since they keep your character busy in an animation for a while, it just gives your enemies time to take you out.In combat there's supposedly a 'counter' option so you can counter a move, but I would jam on the button for it and nothing would happen. Doesn't matter though, I played through the game on normal difficulty without it.Almost all of the boss fights are exactly the same thing... you fight a couple muscle men who charge at you and swing your arms.There's a ton of fan service but it's terribly forced. The voice acting is b-grade at best and the characters are unconvincingIf you want a similar game, with an open world where you pick up upgraded♥♥♥♥♥♥as you go, play Tomb Raider instead. Better everything. If you've played that and you're looking for something more, play this. "

The action elements were heavy combo based with the freeflow system, which made it a fun combat experience. I loved that the characters have the same voices from the animated series. Playing the game only on hard made many parts of the game very tough and it was fun to overcome things, but I was let down how easy the final boss was.			"

Very good replay value to plus many collectables to keep you going once you have completed the story mode. After all this there are challenge maps and downloads maps to contend with.

												You might hesitate to buy this game because Arkham City is better and cheaper.But, in my opinion, this game is still very good. The story and the characters are very interesting. The Joker is the main villain in this game and it is really a thrill to discover his plan. (If you don't already know it.) I also love this game for the scenes with Scarecrow wich are a great representation of the fight happening in Bruce's mind.The gameplay is good and ask for good timing on hard difficulty for the fight and a good thniking for the sneaking part. The challenges and the riddles are fun and get hard enough but still not impossible (I have 100%).If you really like Batman, you'll want to play this game as much as Arkham City and Arkham Origins, even if there is a little bit less gameplay elements.

												This game is AMAZING. Definitely one of the most fun thrid person story based games I have ever played. The storyline is fantastic, the characters are taken straight out of the comic universe so of course that is fantastic, and most importantly, the gameplay is fantastic. Even though it feels like the combat would get repetitive, it just doesn't because there is a perfect blend of environment variety and equiptment pacing. Almost every little thing you can think of feels like it was placed there for a specific game design reason, whether it be the guards standing position, or a little cupboard to hide behind. You generally cycle through different types of gameplay, from brawling, to stealth, to platforming, to pure epic boss fights.I particularly love the encounters with the scarecrow because it really shakes up the gameplay with a completely different camera perspective, and a branched off story about bruce wayne's past. While I usually have too much anxiety to play games with dark settings (like bioshock or deadspace), the game really makes me feel like I am batman and am the hunter not the hunted. I cannot reccomend this game more.			"

												When it comes to video games about superheroes Batman: Arkham Asylum ranks very highly on the list providing a unique experience unlike any that came before it, quite possibly making it the best Batman game ever created.In Arkham Asylum you play as the Batman who is bringing the Joker back to the asylum from his last escape, however things do not feel right and as sure as bat senses tingle the Joker escapes but this time to take control of the asylum with the help of Harley Quinn and various other supervillains in a widespread plan to cause chaos, and now that the inmates run the asylum it is up to Batman to stop them.Plotwise this game works very well, the story has dark tones to it that you come to expect from Batman these days and introduces a bevy of supervillains that Batman must take down all while exploring the more psychological side of heroes and villains and by the end of it the story will leave you satisfied despite the twist and turns that had happened along the way.The gameplay in Arkham Asylum is masterfully done, using many elements from an amazing combat system that lets you pull off flashy moves and counters with single button presses, a stealth system that is done much better then most stealth games seem to do, allowing you to feel as if you are the Batman, hunting these criminals from the shadows ready to pounce, and also has an odd Metroidvania aspect to it where Batman will get upgraded gear along the way that lets him into more places as you explore the island, and the Riddler has hidden things in the environment for you to find such as trophies and solving riddles by finding things hidden in the background.With how well designed this game is there are a few things I could nitpick, such as how sometimes the platforming controls get a bit wonky having you fall off if you are not careful, or how the game can at times feel a bit too easy even on the hardest difficulty, but all of my nitpicks are vastly overshadowed, the game is a tight fifteen hours or so to beat with more time needed if you want to do everything such as find all the riddles and complete the combat and predator challenges that will truly put your skills in the systems this game has to the test.Overall Arkham Asylum is an amazing game, the graphics are top notch and the PC version shows them off even better, with a music score very reminiscent of the Christopher Nolan films, if you have any interest at all in Batman, superheros, or character stealth-action games, this game is ranked highly by me and I recommend it to just about anyone.

												If you add up the time spent in all my games across all my platforms, you will find that I have sunk the most time into this game. Regular, game of the year, special 3D, They all serve for excellent excuses to replay this game. If you're wanting to get into Batman then this is actually a great jumping off point as the lore and characters are so incredibly accurate to the canon of the Dark Knight. I will admit that the physical gameplay is rougher than in the later games so if you go from Arkham City to this then you will feel like you're moving through syrup at times. But this is the game that started the others off and cemented the Arkham games in the public spotlight, and you can tell why while playing, even the collectibles feel fun and interesting to the very end. Stealth, combat, and story all come together to make an unforgettable game that truly makes you feel like the Batman.			"

												Great game based on one of the greatest superheroes of all time--Batman. The combat is immersive; if you ever played Spiderman, the combat mimicks that of Spidey and counter measuring your enemies is very satisfying. Nothing beats dodging and throwing Mike Tyson punches and spin kicks to thugs. Majority of buildings and structures are mountable with your Batlaw to scout areas for enemies or to strategize how to pick them off one-by-one. The latter will apply to situations when there are enemies with machine guns as bullets take a good chunk of Batman's health. Yet this is where it gets fun; you as The Dark Knight can use the Batclaw to mount on a gargoyle and press Y button to hang an unsuspecting thug onto the gargoyle while he screams ""Let me down!"" Others nearby will hear their comrade and rush to him. What do you do? Grapple to the next gargoyle and repeat. You can also take them out silently by sneaking behind them or using certain gadgets. For enemies with only fists and melee weapons, you can just zerg in and counter when necessary. Graphics are amazing as are the movie-like cutscenes. The voice acting is superb. I recommend playing with Physics on. I played with the GTX 295 with Physics set to High and it was outstanding. The game is very fun. Only part what I viewed as tedious was Croc and his lair. Scarecrow was literally creepy and disturbing. Poison Ivy was, well, hot! The final battle to the game's conclusion was a great experience. Simple but challenging. I'm now playing Arkham City. Plan is to play the whole trilogy and Arkham Knight as soon as it releases.			"

												This game is very fun! I like the story of the game. Except the fact that the comics are better than the video games and movies together of the batman series. I enjoy the game because of all the characters in the game. It reminds me of the old batman movies that include bane, riddler, gorden, mr. Freeze, Penguin, and many other enemies; Or supervillians.

												Pretty much interesting game if you got from the humblebundle or any other discount.It's by far a well done game, scenaries are made in a surprising way and your gadgets will change the way u see it in every single moment.Combat can turn boring while most bosses are just adds and hide & hit, and some other stealth areas will burn your time while you try to hunt your enemies. More strategy would be welcome at all, and (SPOILER) final encounters are pretty dissapointing, specially the last one, which is just adds adds and more adds (FINAL OF THE SPOILER).As I said, a very good choice if you have a nice discount, but wouln't pay much for that game i guess.

												Ah, Batman Arkham Asylum. The beggining to a fantastic series, and the greatest Batman videogame series of all time. Simply a masterpiece.Where do I start?Arkham Asylum is unique compared to the other 3 games (I include Origins, no hate), because it's not open world. So you don't have a huge playground to play around with. It also has the most difficult stealth and combat, and other things, due to lacking double counters, double takedowns, knockout smashes, quickfire gadgets, the dive bomb, and most importantly, quick escapes with the Grapnel Boost/Accelerator or the Smoke Pellet. Here, armed men actually pose a challenge. That makes you think more tactically and plan ahead, more than the other games.Definitely recommended.I recommend to play the whole series in this order : Asylum, then City, then Origins, and finally, Arkham Knight. Trust me.9/10 "

												All time favourite Batman gameMany Open-world RPG type games still use this game as their benchmarkGraphics still hold up today and the gameplay is fluid as anything if you know what you're doingStory is well thought out and long enough to enjoy but there is heaps to do once youve finished the story. Even if it is just getting those last Riddler challenges or getting 3 stars on the challenge maps.Recommend this game to anyone who is even a slight fan of Batman or enjoys a good RPG			"

												I know I'm very late posting this review, but I'm going to do it anyway.TL;DR:Pros:- Smooth combat system (choice of beat-em-up or stealth)- Be the Batman. Use his gadgets.- Learn more Batman lore than you knew existed- Engaging and new plot- Dynamic Dialogue- Appealing art style and graphicsCons:- Controls on Mac were a little hard to get used to, but you can change your keyboard bindings, and I believe you also have the option of playing with a gamepad.Breezy's full review: Batman: Arkham Asylum is hands down the best video game based on a comic that I've ever played and one of the best games overall in my collection. I remember playing the demo at my local GameStop and being sort of skeptical as it just seemed like another beat-em-up. Flash forward to about 5 years later and I'm so glad that I was wrong.    The story is refreshing and encapsulating. The dialogue is great (a lot of times humorous, a lot of times epic, only sometimes corny). Like everyone else says, the combat system is the most fluid I've seen in a video game, though I much prefer the ""Predator"" style of combat (taking out enemies stealthily) in the game. Being the Batman and getting to use all his gadgets (Batclaw, Detective Mode, explosive gel, batarang (in the form of the normal, multiple, explosive, and remote controlled)), and appearances by both the Batmobile and the Batwing were definitely a treat.   I honestly have to say that the Riddler trophies were my favorite part of the game. When the trophies were first introduced in the game I really had no intention of collecting all 240 of them. But the developers did something very clever and linked character backgrounds to most of the trophies. Some of the trophies take the form of interview tapes with Arkham inmates, Chronicles of Arkham (cryptic messages left by Amadeus Arkham to be found and deciphered), or simply scanning the environment as a visual answer to one of the Riddler's riddles. Of course, there are actual trophies you can find, but I much prefered the ones that would provide some background on the characters. Before this game, I had minimal knowledge of the Batman universe. When I discovered that the trophies could actually unlock character bios (and some nice viewable character trophies), I became obsessed with finding them. Through the character bios and other various forms of the trophies, I became educated on more of the Batman universe than I thought I would want to know. But don't get me wrong, every detail about a character or asset in the Batman world interested more than the last.   Actual gameplay wise, I probably beat it in about 12-13 hours. However, as you can see from my hours played, I spent a lot more time in the game than that. What was I doing? Collecting trophies, of course. Also, I spent several hours in the challenge maps where you rack up points by seeing how long of a combo you can get on enemies or you complete predator challenges, where you must knock out enemies in a specific way (i.e. break through a glass ceiling to take out an enemy). The GOTY Edition DLC  offers you the choice of playing as the Joker in these challenge maps, and it's pretty awesome and a nice change of pace from playing as Batman. End note:My only real prior knowledge of Batman came after Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy and that was about the extent of it (besides watching a few episodes of the animated series growing up). The movies were great, expecially the Dark Knight, but they didn't really expand on the Batman universe, but instead focused on dark realism. This game, however, seemed to capture the wonder and atmosphere of the Batman comics and various animated series. I guess you could say that Batman has gained a Batfan. Thanks for reading.			"

Plenty to do if you are one of those people that like 'collectables' in games, while providing a strong story line that compliments the introduction of 'The Joker' to the series.			"

												Thouroughly enjoyed this game, I had previous experience with this game a few years ago but only now had the motivation to complete the story. The combat is fluent but can be repititive but still manages to stay satisfying, especially when using the batclaw for finishers and extended combos. Graphics are great for the time it was released and showed very little graphical errors (though some pixelation during the final cutscene). The riddler adds a lot of exploration and keeps your eyes open for anything and everything, not to mention spending a hell of a lot of time circling your camera around rooms in detective mode to find riddler trophies. The main plot had little depth but the riddler and the colectibles you gather than tell individual character stories are very promising for anyone who enjoys a thourough story. I'm yet to try any of the other modes but I can definitely recommend the game for its generally satisfying gameplay and interesting start to the Arkham game series.			"

												I have heard a lot about the Arkham games for a long time now, and when I saw that this game was 5 dollars, I said,""Hey why not."" Now that I have played to the end, I can say that this game is outstanding. I already was a fan of batman before I bought this, and this game just made batman look more badass then I thought he was. The characters and story are pretty good, and the gameplay is fun and sneaky, like how batman should be. You get cool weapons, you fight some of batmans old enemies, and you get to explore all of arkham asylum(its larger than I expected). If you are a fan of batman, buy this, it feels like one big batman movie, except you control batman. If you like exploring games, then you'll love this game too. 5/5			"

												At first I wasn't so sure if I'd enjoy the first game as I only got because I wanted to play Arkham City because... Catwoman, I mean we get to play as Catwoman. That and because I at first I wasn't that much of a fan of the claustrophobic level design, but after finishing AC, I decided to get back into AA and found a new appreciation for the game and its focus and character development.""Most of the game's leading characters are voiced by actors who have appeared in other media based on the DC Animated Universe; Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, and Arleen Sorkin reprised their roles as Batman, the Joker, and his sidekick Harley Quinn respectively."" The game written by veteran Batman writer Paul Dini is awesome, though the boss fights are somewhat repetitive and collecting the Riddler's trophy a drag.If you're gonna get Arkham City then I highly recommend getting the GOTY edition of this game. Its so totally worth it. Origins... I'm.... not so sure about that....			"

Excellent, simple controls that forces you to rely on timing and skills to pull off variations and combos, blocking, evading and countering attacks!

												Ok this game keeps having sales and so I am going to write a review on it because I played it and it was pretty freaking amazing and I recommend getting it for your collection the next time it has a sale WHAT A MOUTHFUL. But this game feels VERY new, and very wicked amazing...it's a ""hey, we're in a new age of gaming"" game. Everything's polished and built really well in this game. I think what draws me the most is #1: The freeflow feeling combat. FREAKING AWESOME and very fun and no strings attached. I could do challenge modes in the extras section for hours and totally love it. #2: The story is AMZING cool, i LOVE the gothic-yet-heroic feel of it. It made me want to watch Dark Knight. But it also made me want to go buy all the comics ever made because they really give you the opprotunity to immerse you into the Batman&Friends&Enemies story by giving you fun data things all about them when you collect trophies, etc. The music and killer voice acting also MAKE it.

												The original and still the best in the series.It's more focused environment leads to a more tightly crafted game that just begs to be explored. While the later games in the series offer a more open ended approach with arguably more things to see and do, in practice they seem to offer little more than filler between heavily scripted events. While collectibles, secrets and side missions often feel like chores in the later games, they feel like meaningful reasons to fully explore the asylum with appropriate rewards on offer. Each area is filled with unique assets and small, rememberable details. The riddlers side missions task you with photographing scenes that are unique to various characters from the Dark Knight universe which helps to direct the player toward these specially crafted, and unique in-game assets.The combat system, while arguably too simplistic, is a delight to control as you see Batman stringing insane combo's together effortlessly disarming, and countering incoming attacks. Every kick, punch, grapple and counter is animated well making fights seem appropriately realistic and violent. The combat is assisted by some excellent audio leading to some satisfying crunches, cracks, and smacks as bones break and fists collide with faces.The metroid-vania aspects of the game are implemented well, with each upgrade offering the oppertunity to revisit locations throughout the game.The story is well told and the voice acting is excellent throughout, although I felt the final parts of the story were anticlimactic with the final boss fight in particular being tedius and frankly, rather silly. Seeing the Joker turn into a roid-raged meathead seemed rather out of character, and a little far-fetched - even for a comic book super villain.On a technical level, the game still looks great to this day and runs exceptionally well. A mid-range pc should be able to run this game on maximum settings with a solid 60fps.All-in-all it's a ground breaking game and in my opinion one of the best games of it's generation. A true masterpiece.			"

												I actually played Arkham City before Asylum, but the gameplay is good, combat system great and immersion plentyfull, if you don't mind ignoring the Riddler's challenges; The storyline itself is of such degree that it kept me interested, but the side-challenges and collectibles are too much of a distraction in my opinion.It is a testament to the world of Batman, and as such it comes as no surprise that most rewards come in the shape of a trophy or character profiles. It is a problem I can live with.Interesting and fun to play, but once finished it's just another name in a list of games...			"

												Batman: Arkham Asylum needs no introduction. It won massive amount of awards including game of the year award. It simply shines in every single category. Graphic is dark and beautiful just like a real stealth game should have. GamePlay is fantastic, I can’t believe how good controls work on PC. I heard on few occasions that people complain to the lack of combat moves but with all the gadgets at your disposal I see no problem there. Story is great and entertaining throughout the whole game. The only thing I saw as a bummer was combat challenges which were a bit too much for my taste and made me frustrated on several occasions. But since that’s the only problem I see in this entire game I see no reason why you shouldn’t own this game on your PC. So go on and grab this 8/10.			"

												This game started the entire Arkham series off with great style and flow! This game started a great time to be a Batman fan. The gameplay is amazing, the looks of the game back in the day were amazing and still hold up well now 7 years later! The story was also an amazing immersive world with loads of lore and backstory all over the place with collectibles challenges and more to try throughout Arkham Asylum. There was a lot of depth for the first outing as the caped crusader. He was brutal, calculated and smart giving a very large dynamic of things to do throughout the game. The biggest innovation was the combat system Rocksteady created, and they held up thsi combat system with small changes here and there to improve it and alter it slightly. The gameplay is changed up with the addition of gadgets that allow a whole different set of combo's for you to change up the gameplay with. The world is amazing, the detail is amazing and this game is amazing. Worth a buy!Tl;dr, amazing game, buy it!			"

Lovely initializer of the franchise, but combat mechanics are clunkier and little gliding time & gadgets compared to AC. Still, if it is the first Batman game you will enjoy it - even w/o being too much of a Batman fan.			"

												What is there to say about the famous Batman that has not already been said? Batman is my favorite hero, hands down. Maybe that makes me slightly biased in this review, but Batman: Arkham Asylum is exactly how a Batman game should be for long-time or even newly-born fans. I am not inclined to lie about him being a ""super"" hero, because he ultimately does not have super powers. His gadgets make him a super being, BUT he does not have super-human abilities, unlike his nemesises or other ""super"" heroes in likeness of Superman and whatnot. He drives a Batmobile; I mean, who does not love this guy? The two main parts about this game that stood out to me the most are not only the constant action throughout the entirety of the game (fighting mechanics, flying mechanics, and the like), but the Scarecrow and the Joker are what make this game what it is. Without spoiling the game for anyone who has not indulged in this experience yet, Scarecrow plays an epic part in this game; it is one of my favorite parts in gaming history. The Joker is hilarious; he kept me laughing consistently, which is a plus in any game. This game is stunning, graphics wise; the gameplay is absolutely one hundred pecent fun, one hundred percent of the time; the story-line is full of character, as there are an extensive amount of villians in it; basically, this game is perfection at its finest hour. Everything about it is exhilerating. Sometimes, more so than not, games are disappointing when they are hyped up, but this one is as pleasing as pie, unless you are into cake. It is not by any means a short game either, so if you enjoy a decent amount of gameplay, this is your match. You will not be disappointed, trust me! I have played over 1,000 + games, and this is one of my favorites.			"

												This game has been released for a long time and only at this time of my life I had the chance to play this game. And all I can say is ""Let's get this party started!""Ding d-ding, dong! First of all, I really love the environment and the character models, specifically on their details. Voice acting is also great, especially Mark Hamill[www.imdb.com]. Profoundly speaking, the perfect voice actor for Joker – ""He’s crazy, you know"" – but the secondary characters and enemy henchmen have poor variety in voice-overs. Speaking of henchmen, with the freeflow combat system you can really ”Eat punks like these for breakfast.” You can seamlessly chain together unlimited combos not just with your barehands but with your “bat prefixed"" gadgets as well. And speaking of gadgets, it’s pretty sweet if you will be able to utilize all of these in the game especially on solving the puzzles and of course with the help of the Detective Mode – I mean why wouldn’t Batman have a detective mode? He’s the WORLD’S GREATEST DETECTIVE! Plus to that, the hidden challenges and unlocking the secrets of Arkham Asylum really spice it up for Batman for being a detective. Another thing I also love is the silent takedowns – that pretty sums up Batman being the ""Dark Knight"" – and the convenience of hiding from the henchmen. They’ll just be surprised that you came out of nowhere and say, ""That guy freaks me out.” Well, I finished the game on normal. I’ll have another go on hard and see if it will be more difficult for me to hide from the henchmen. And the last thing is about the boss fights. It’s pretty good they have some different variations. But somehow, for me, they kinda seem littler easier than the fights with the mobs LOL. Especially the final battle!All in all it’s a 9/10! See you in Arkham City, Bats!

												Superheroes have had issues with past video games, often being inaccurately portrayed or having  glitchy gameplay (I'm looking at you Superman 64). Thankfully though, this game isn't one of them. You've probably already heard all of the praises being sung over the Batman: Arkham series, so I'll keep this short: This game is amazing. Wonderful gameplay, fast-flowing action, a bunch of wacky characters to match wits against and enough challenges to keep you busy for quite a while. Oh, and you get to play as Batman of course.The game consists of Joker taking over Arkham Asylum and Batman having to stop him, battling inmates, rescuing guards and sneaking around taking down thugs in the most Batman ways possible.Just as the Dark Knight Trilogy defined Batman on film, the Arkham series defined Batman in games, setting a standard to which all future superhero games should aspire to.BE THE BATMAN ;)			"

The story telling is top notch and features some very clever moments, the world fully realised and polished to perfection and the gameplay is engaging - especially combat, which is truely easy to learn and hard to master (and a requirement to beat all of the challenge rooms!).

												Amazing game. Anything you read online about this game being one of the best is true. But, I strongly recommend you play this installment of the Arkham series before any other, because the games only get better.Combat: Depending on the hardware you are running, it can be anywhere from erratic and choppy to fluid. If you can hold a steady 30 frames, then you can really appreciate the combat. Upgrades give you more options in how you take down thugs, and boss fights are challenging and rewarding.Stealth: Stealth missions really require you to stop and think about how you want to handle a room. Be wary of line of sight as well, because if you can see them, they can see you. Note: Not as refined as the next titles in the Arkham series.Environment: Everything looks and feels like a true Batman story. The environment is dirty and gritty, and you know you're Arkham just by looking around. It's a nice mix of high-security technology and Gothic architecture.Do recommend, 10/10			"

The game itself is quite linear but the fights are just awesome, the graphics are great and the voice acting is on the same level as a hollywood movie.The game isn't really challenging in any way at any point due to easy puzzles and even large groups of enemies not being  a real threat because you can just block-counter each and every attack and not get hit once.Still, a lot of fun if you just want to sit back and want to enjoy some good gaming moments.May not be worth the 20 bucks unless you're a fan of batman, but gets dropped to about 5€ every now and then.

												Batman Arkham Asylum is an action\adventure ""super hero"" game.So after many average and horrible batman games is Batman Arkham Asylumworth trying ? well I can answer your question right away.You start the game when batman caught the most famous villian the Jokerand sents him back to prison ( Arkham Asylum ) where he should be belong,even though the guards should be able to do the rest, batman sense that something isn't quite right and that he should keep his eye on Joker after all Joker gave up so easily almost without a fight. After what it seems that the Joker well be sent to his place, Joker escaped killing the guards in his way and somehow controlling all the asylum in a blink of an eye. Now it up to batman to stop Joker and find out what was Joker's planning all this time.Gameplay : the combat is great and fluid almost perfect, it combines stealth approach, puzzles and riddles and of course brute force. This is the first game that will make you feel that you are the batman that you are in cotrol of your gadgets, fighting style and detective's skills.I can rest assure you that Batman Arkham Asylum gameplay is one of the best there is to offer.Story : its been a long time since I was so interested in a game's storyline,the cutscenes\dialog\twists are just great. You will be suprised and thrilled by what will come next, also lets not forget about the characters which all of them are amazingly done. Graphics : What can I say ? beautiful,amazing,outstanding and perfectly fit to the batman's art style. One of the best I have seen in 2009 and even today its just plain impressive.AI + difficulty : this is where I think that Batman Arkham Asylum could be better,while the game has diffrent enemies and every boss fight is unique, still the gameis too damn easy even on the hard difficulty, only the challenges gives the feeling that I might actually lose.Music + Sound : I can't say too much cause the only thing that comes in my mind is the word ""Perfection"" Summary : Batman Arkham Asylum trully deserves the ""Game of the year"" title of 2009, one of the most suprising,impressive and outstanding games there is to offer and God help those who didn't play the game yet. The only thing that bothers me was the difficulty which was too easy for me, but overall I'll give this game a 9.5\10			"

												This game is a must play, I first played it at a whopping 17 FPS on an old PC, but with my recent upgrade i felt it deserved to be completed (at its true potential).It is an incredibly satisfying game, with an extremely engaging story (ending is a bit lax) but fun non the less, and full to the brim with batman Easter Eggs.The combat is similar in style to Assassins Creed, but with its own Batman flare. Even with it being repetitive, you will purposely engage enemies when there is not need to because it is that satisfying. No star rating, just a must play for any gamer.			"

												A good unreal 3 mod, but just a decent game overall.I played through it and got 240/240 riddles along with beating the storyline and joker.I did not finish all of the challenges or all of the DLC challenges, just got to be more of the same.Graphics are decent, but the color palette was boring and ugly plus you played most of the game in detective mode and this made the look uni-colored.I recommend it ONLY if it is cheap enough, I bought it when they ditched GFWL and securom, out of respect for those decisions.I enjoyed the boss battles and I enjoyed the 2d platforming with the scarecrow the most.The scarecrow scenes were amazing, very psychedelic.

												The first game in which you actually feel like Batman. Wonderful stealth gameplay, fluid and awe-inspiring free-flow combat sections and an amazing story. Mark Hamill is fantastic as the Joker, and I would dare say he is better than both Ledger and Nicholson! Only complaints I have are that I personally felt that the game wasn't very replayable and also the final boss battle is rather anti-climactic.			"

You'll glide , sneak into tight spaces , zipline , go stealth , fight bad guys , solve mysteries and best of all be BATMAN . Theres no other way you can skip this experience for along time			"

												A surprising and welcome contradiction to the notion that all film-based video games are inherently terrible. Particularly graphic intensive for its time, but it does not skimp out on content by any means. The game has plenty of lore, encounters from many classic villains, and relatively fluid controls and combat options. The game lends itself more toward stealth combat, which fits Batman's persona entirely well.Very much a worthy purchase.			"

												Great game builds on the DC characters and brings the Batman franchise to the game world very successfully I was hesitant when I first heard of this title but to my surprised it was a great game.Great cast of characters great story set in Arkam Asylum great portrayal of the chemistry between Joker and Batman and the lengths each will go to.I am not one who usually goes for all the collectable in a game as it usually just there to elongate a short game, the way the developers wove a story into collecting and solving all of the Riddlers puzzles and trophies was great and added a lot more depth and context to why you had to find them.The combat system is amazing I never expected a combat system of this quality from a licensed 3rd person action game.Must buy in my opinion great game.

												In a word: playable.Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy this game, but it didn't wow me the way I expected it to. After years of hearing praise for the story, combat system, etc, I decided to give it a try, but I'd say it's only about 40% fun and 60% frustration.Pros:-Decent graphics that still hold up 7 years later.-Good looking designs for Batman's rogues gallery, especially Joker who, looking more like the classic version, was a welcome change from the now stagnant Heath Ledger version everyone was obsessed with at the time.-Believable story (even with the body sized ventilation shafts and conveniently placed gargoyles).-Hearing the voice actors from Batman: TAS was pretty cool.-Cool gadgetsCons:-Navigation was a royal pain. I had to constantly check the map to see where I was going, and backtrack every 5 minutes.-The Riddler challenge is a distracting side quest that I ultimately gave up on.-The fighting mechanics gave me a headache. Countering only worked half the time, and it would constantly go into slow motion, which is hard to control. To be fair, it did set the standard for other combat styles, such as Shadow of Mordor, which requires a bit of strategy but actually works if you know what you're doing. Here, I basically just spend the whole fight clicking and mashing the spacebar, because I'm not in control at all.Overall, I did enjoy it, but I would not put it in my top 5.			"

												If you haven't played this yet you're missing out on something special.3D brawler gameplay that actually works combined with the genuine sensation that you ARE the Batman.  It's got all the qualities we've come to know and love the Dark Knight's ongoing mythology for, with a decent roster of Gotham's criminally insane lining up to take their shot at the Bat.  The story is beefed up with an excellent script and voice acting fit for the ages.  Mark Hamill's out-of-the-box psychotic Joker brings a wry smile to your face with every one-liner.Arkham Asylum's gameplay is semi-immersed in stealth.  Enemies who are armed with guns are dangerous if faced directly, so the game teaches you how to move around and take out foes one by one.  Difficulty is scaled up with the acquisition of more gadgets, so adaptation of new techniques becomes paramount to Batman's survival - as it should be.A special mention is deserved for the game's audio and visual presentation which pump a gritty, suspenseful atmosphere into  the experience.  Arkham Asylum could have easily faultered on these qualities, but it doesn't.    There is really no excuse for you not to have played Arkham Asylum.  Nobody expected it to do what it does with such grace and respect for its source material.  Just buy the bloody thing and play it if you haven't already; you'll soon realise what all the fuss is about.			"

												Batman Arkham Asylum is one reason why I like the superhero genre games. The reason being that is that you play as the Dark Knight himself and using his gadgets. The synopsis of the game is Batman captures The Joker and brings him to Arkham Asylum to be kept there, but all along it was a trap as Joker wants to takeover the Asylum for himself. The Joker escapes from his captivity and is on the loose. Now the Greatest Detective has solve this problem by trying to find the Joker within Arkham Asylum and ask him what he really want to do.  The gameplay is amazing with features like Detective Mode which makes you see everything in X-Ray vision but it useful to see if there is any of Joker's Thugs is in the room. The abillty to use the batarang is amazing and to use the Batclaw which can bring down walls. Overall I think that this game is worth a buy if you are a Batman fan or if you like stealth and beat'em up genres.			"

Batman: Arkham Asylum really stands out as one of the best superhero video games out there (another one being its sequel, Arkham City, but more about that in another review). The gameplay is rock-solid in a Metroidvania-esque fashion, the voice-over work is fantastic with many classic voices returning (like Mark Hamill as the Joker and Kevin Conroy as the Dark Knight himself), and the story is well-written and satisfying for the most part.The whole game takes place on Arkham Island, where the Joker has gained control over the titular insane asylum. The location is really atmospheric and is a very believable setting for a Batman story, in a little contrast to the setting in Arkham City which had a little more creative freedom applied to it (again, more on that in the future).The main story is a bit on the short side, but combined with the Riddler challenges and the combat/predator challenges, it will keep you busy for a good 20-25 hours for 100% completion. Not too shabby.It isn't possible to review Arkham Asylum and not mention the simple, yet satisfying freeflow -combat system. It takes little skill to beat up the bad guys, but racking up massive combos takes some work and is very enjoyable. What's even more pleasing than beating them up directly is the stealth, or ""predator"" sections, where you use your environment to your advantage and take out your enemies without being seen.You might enjoy this game even if you don't like Batman. Under the Batman -shell is a rock-solid game that is without question worth picking up. Who knows? Maybe you'll start to like the series after playing this?			"

												A good plot, interesting villains and of course the ability to beat the living daylights out of various thugs while proclaiming ""I'M BATMAN!"" What more could you want? A gun that shoots shuriken and lightning? Don't be absurd, you know Batman's rules...If this is your first foray into the Batman Universe beyond the Christopher Nolan films, you might find this Batman and his villains to be less ""gritty"" and ""realistic"". However, if you even consider this to be a flaw, you'll soon forget about your gripes as the writing and voice-acting draws you in and makes you forget that there ever could be a different Batman.The main storyline is top notch and the various collectible items side quests keep you playing well beyond beating up a Titan-enhanced Joker with explosive fists .Overall a well-crafted, immersive game.

												Being a fan of Bruce Tim animations, open worlds and upgrade collection, Arkham Asylum scratched an itch.  This is one instance where a license appears to have been handled correctly with a competent product.  Hearing the old cast, wielding Batman's arsenal and using stealth to take down enemies were all immensely satisfying.However, I had two problems with the game:1) Arkham Asylum traps the player inside boss battles.  Want to explore and upgrade?  Tough.  The game decided to autosave.  You're stuck playing a frustrating minigame with questionable resemblance to normal combat.2) Enemies don't respawn.  When solving riddles, this is good for decreasing travel time.  However, I didn't learn the bulk of the combat basics until the final battle.  I focused on stealth, rarely counterattacked and made it through with a low combo count.  By the time more advanced techniques were necessary, I had removed every opportunity to experiment from the story.  Practice in the challenges.			"

												Great brawler with strong adventure elements, and an awesome theme. I'd recommend this even if you don't typically enjoy brawlers, the combat is pitched at a level of complexity, there's often multiple way's to get through an area and there's a good mix of open areas and enclosed spaces.

												Played it 4 times of which 3 were 100% runs. The series went downhill fast after this entry but this one is still in my top 5 games of all time. Even ignoring the fact that you're the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Batman it's just such a solid experience all the way through. Right amount of familiar video gamey parts and inventive stuff. Not the deepest stealth or combat but both had just the right amount of variety at least for me. Still looks kinda nice upressed too.			"

												Batman Arkham Asylum has got to be one of my favourite games ever. I just love how they depict Batman in the Arkham universe. Whats even better are the easter eggs because they all refer to the comic books and movies. In my opinion this game is WAY better than Arkham City and Arkham Origins combined. A truly remarkable game.10/10!			"

												I had purchased this a LONG time ago and let it sit around while I was playing other things. I've really regret doing that. This is such an amazingly fantastic game that you will not want to put it down.The voice acting is second to none, you got the stellar Kevin Conroy (whom you may know from the Justice League / Unlimited cartoons) voicing Batman, and Mark Hamill as the Joker as the main protagonist and antagonist. Harley Quinn also makes an appearance in an outfit you won't soon forget, as well as a number of other key Batman villains with varying purposes and roles.The combat system is immensely satisfying, as you level your character up, you gain more techniques to use against enemies (whom you can fight upwards of 8-13 in some instances) and they are all quite useful once you get them into your routine.I cannot recommend this game highly enough, what an amazing Batman game this turned out to be!

												The first of the Batman: Arkham Series. This game is fantastic. I was wary when purchasing this game  because I heard it was not as good Arkham City and that it can be very repeditive and buggy but I am over all very happy that I bought this game. Although it may be a bit repeditive I still had a blast playing it! The campaign is brilliant. It is about a 20 hour campaign that I enjoyed thoroughly. The graphics are pretty good too. (Especially for a game that came out in 2009.) I reccomend this game to anyone who is a huge DC fan such as myself and to anyone that enjoys an exciting but not too challenging game. 8.5/10			"

												Still the best Batman game in the Arkham series and probably the best Batman game ever made. The story involves Batman catching Joker easily after a recent robbery and, coincidentally, Joker's gang moved to the Asylum because of an issue at the Blackgate Prison - once inside the Asylum, the Joker escapes and taskes control of the Asylum and prepares to unearth something far worse than what you initially suspect. You play as Batman trying to unearth this plot and once again stop the Joker.To this day, this game still has amazing visuals, Batman himself covering around half the screen, looks the part and stands strong and confident as the character should as well as the texture work on his suit are top notch - the rest of the game fairs the same, since the game has been given an outstanding amount of care and work into every area you go through. Not one area in the game feels exactly the same as another even if they look similar. Very stellar work of textures all around overall.I don't say this is the best Batman game out there for no reason - gameplay is pretty basic ""Brawler"" style with very minor puzzle solving, but what makes this game different, from, say a game like Assassin's Creed - is the ""Free Flow combat system"" the game has. The combat is slightly similar to the first Assassin's Creed, except - the flow combat system allows Batman to basically jump from one foe to another in a very fast manner, almost rythmically, to get a combo counter to go as high as you can while still making it challenging by giving the foes still standing a fighting chance and implementing counters. You can also explore the entirety of the Arkham Asylum as you unlock areas and you can do a variety of things while exploring, you can face groups of enemies scattered around, you can do Riddler Challenges - whom are a bunch of mini puzzles scattered around the Asylum that involves the use of Batman's Detective Mode, these range from finding a specific item found in the area or marks that require the Detective Mode to find and a ""Complete the Mark"" type of game that involves you scanning the area from specific places to complete a full mark, etc - Riddler trophies, and a bunch of case files to find out more background information on Batman characters and villains (as well as the history behind Arkahm Asylum) that are often very well realized and fun to hear. The Detective Mode & Gadgets: You'll be using these a LOT on your trudge through Arkham Asylum. Ranging from the standard Batarangs and Grappling hook (used for mundane objectives such as getting to and pulling out vents from hard to reach places, etc), the Explosive Gel (Used a lot to surprise enemies, to find weak walls to find trophies and secrets and to progress in the story as well!) and a bunch more. The Detecive Mode helps you analyze weak walls to use your Explosive Gel on and other gadgets as well as analyze enemy/allies conditions and, more important later on in the game, to find out which enemies carry weapons or are special enemies.).So in general, if you ever wanted to know and feel what a life in the day of Batman is, this is definately your game, more so than the sequels (imo). From the excellent assets and sound to follow it up with, and the pitch perfect gameplay to go along with it, this sits as one of my favourite video game experiences and currently my best experience playing as the legendary Dark Knight.

												Arkham Asylum is the only Batman Arkham game so far where you really feel immersed in a major Batman comics story.Arkham City was the first Batman Arkham game I've played and it's probably going to be the one responsible for my most cherished memories of the series, but so far Asylum has really surprised me as the best Batman experience in a video game ever, even better than City in this regard. Here you meet major foes such as Joker, Harley Quinn and Scarecrow, all with great characterization and dialogues, in a tense and yet damn fun plot in the huge Arkham Island, with a mix of sweet combat and stealth gameplays.If you're a Batman fan looking for a Batman game, start by this one and you won't regret it one bit.

REVIEW: BATMAN: ARKHAM ASYLUMAs I have mentioned in my review of Portal 2, I am behind the times when it comes to the latest games, and one of the many games on my ‘to-play’ list was Batman: Arkham Asylum. Finding it cheap in a store was great, as it meant that I could finally give it a go. But would I find it any good?In Batman: Arkham Asylum, Batman has caught the Joker (again), but, suspicious at the ease at which the Clown Prince of Crime allowed himself to be captured, Batman decides to escort the Joker to his cell. Unfortunately, the Joker was counting on this. Not only was he planning on being caught and returned to Arkham Asylum, but he planned on Batman being there as well. Batman must fight his way through the asylum, confronting some of his most persistent adversaries, from Bane to Poison Ivy. But what is the Joker after? What is Titan? And can Batman stop the Joker’s plans?While I’m not that big a fan of the Batman comics in particular, I have read many of the graphic novels, including one that seems to be an inspiration for this game: Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth. That was an intelligent but harrowing mind-screw of a book that clearly inspired more than a few elements. The story, while not at complex epic levels, is good for what it is: a comic book story transferred to a computer game. I’m surprised that, given how Paul Dini (of the serious but still kid-oriented animated series) wrote it, how adult the game seems. Which goes to show my ignorance. Graphics-wise, the game is beautiful. I am sure that there are more games out there that look better (including Arkham Asylum’s direct sequel, Arkham City, which I am currently playing), but I am not a person who wants their game’s graphics to be ultra-realistic, as long as the graphical style is enjoyable, and that it is. The character design, for the most part, is actually quite excellent, though I am a little bemused at the rather fetishized appearances of Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy, even compared to their comic book versions.Sound-wise, it is quite immersive and atmospheric. The voice acting is enjoyable, with particular, if predictable, praise going to Mark Hamill as the Joker. I know him more as Luke Skywalker, so to hear him play the Joker is a revelation. The sound effects all work, and the music helps give an edge of dread, without it missing the Elfman/Zimmer edge of the Batman atmosphere.Gameplay wise, the game is somewhat mixed, although this is partly because this game was developed first and foremost as a console game rather than a PC game. I played on easy simply because of an apprehension I had about the control scheme, and I still found the game challenging, partly because I used a keyboard and mouse as opposed to a controller. That being said, the combat is enjoyable, if a little repetitive, and the Predator Sequences (sequences where one must attack stealthily) are challenging, but in a mostly good way. The gadgets all lend not only to the gameplay, but to the feeling that one is actually Batman. There’s even a few sequences where the World’s Greatest Detective (as Batman is hyped as) actually does some detecting. The sidequests of the Riddler Challenges are actually quite enjoyable and taxing, and nothing beats that little thrill of satisfaction when you beat one of them, and while Riddler accuses you of looking them up on the internet, you actually just found almost all the solutions on your own. My only real complaint, other than the control scheme, is that, even with the Riddler Challenges, the game was over rather swiftly.Overall, Batman: Arkham Asylum is an enjoyable game that is really how Batman should be played. Flawed, but still enjoyable and highly recommended.RATING: **** "

												At first I wasn't so sure if I'd enjoy the first game as I only got because I wanted to play Arkham City because... Catwoman, I mean we get to play as Catwoman. That and because I at first I wasn't that much of a fan of the claustrophobic level design, but after finishing AC, I decided to get back into AA and found a new appreciation for the game and its focus and character development.""Most of the game's leading characters are voiced by actors who have appeared in other media based on the DC Animated Universe; Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, and Arleen Sorkin reprised their roles as Batman, the Joker, and his sidekick Harley Quinn respectively."" The game written by veteran Batman writer Paul Dini is awesome, though the boss fights are somewhat repetitive and collecting the Riddler's trophy a drag.If you're gonna get Arkham City then I highly recommend getting the GOTY edition of this game. Its so totally worth it. Origins... I'm.... not so sure about that....			"

												The first game in the Arkham Franchise. I started off playing Arkham City that got me hooked into not only the games, but Batman lore in general. Heading into this game, I was exicted to play the game that started it all and was not disappointed. The game runs smoothly and looks great as expected for a PC Title and It is very enganging to play. I personally love the combat system in this game as well as in the other arkham titles. This game for me comes in 2nd place when it comes to the Arkham Franchise (City being my favorite) and I definetly recommend it to not only people who are into Batman, but those who love Stealth games or Action Games in general.

												The last Batman movie I saw was the one with Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze, back when it was in the theater. I don't care for super hero movies much, but don't disparage them either. I have no emotional ties to this franchise.This game is excellent. Great variety in gadgets and modes of play. Hard, but not too hard. A few places that got frustrating, but not too frustrating. The whole series of Riddler Challenges is well-lain-out and intriguing. I got this in a bundle with Arkham City GOTY and Arkham origins base game for ten bucks, and this game by itself would be worth three times that, easily. And I'm a cheap bastich, so that's saying a lot. So excited to 100% this, eventually, and start Arkham City.			"

I think I originally spent about 30 bucks for this game on PS3 when I was about 13 and 4 years later I only regret not playing it maxed out on a PC.			"

												Perhaps the best 3rd person game ever made and must have for any Batman fan and fans of any good games period. It takes the best of Assassin's Creed and the best of God of War and makes this beautiful love child. This is my person game of the year for 2008.			"

												This game has nice gameplay, nice graphic, but the most that I like is the combat. Play on an island find Joker, fight with many bosses like Bane, Harley, Ivy, Killer Croc...blah blah and collect many collectibles. Joker is a crazy psycho!!!For me this game is 9.5/10			"

												One of the best games I have played in years. The Joker is one of the best written characters I have seen in a game, and I cant get enough of this game. A huge game on the 360 for me, moving onto the PC, this was a must buy. Took a while to get used to the PC controls, but its rather easy once you get into it.9.5/10 - Synergy Rating			"

Soviet's Fast ReviewsVisuals+ Graphics look smooth and have decent amount of texture detail+ Animations of characters and combat are fluid and look organic- Certain areas have flat textures- The game is often too dark and some things blend into each otherGameplay+ Controls feel solid and performing combo moves is fairly easy+ Glide mechanic and gadgets are fun to use and feel solid- Some of the voice acting feels stiff and doesn't really fit the situation at certain moments- Missions are all over the place and can be tedious to run between buildingsOverallBatman Arkham Asylum throws you right into the eyes of Bruce Wayne/Batman as he transports the Joker to the criminal institution known as Arkham Asylum. The story is quite rich and introduces various characters from the comic books as well as some pretty cool features like the Detective Mode which lets you see the enemies through walls, items hidden in cracks, and switches to activate. Combat is smooth, though the limited combo list can make the constant fight sequences seem a bit tedious. Despite its age and the launch of other sequels, Arkham Asylum is still very fun to play and the story is definitely one of the best of any franchise to date. If you're looking for a great superhero title, check Arkham Asylum on your list of games to purchase.			"

												Batman Arkham Asylum is an amazing, third person, action game. The gameplay is very fluent and fun once you get the hang of it, and I have absolutely no complaints about that. The gameplay is probably my favorite part about this game, the story on the other hand was interesting as well. The story seems to reflect the way the old Batman comics used to be, and definitely feels like a Batman story, which is good. Overall, the game is definitely worth the money and is loaded with hours of beating up criminals and grappling around the place. It did not feel very repetitive at all, in fact, it did a lot of things right to make sure you enjoy the game such as little hidden unlockables, different enemy types and environments, and fun bosses. Pick this game up right now if you can, or wait until a sale because it goes on sale pretty often.			"

												This is still today one of the best games i have ever played. This game proved that a comic book based videogame can be great, instead of a lot of movie tied videogames that tend to suck. It has a mix of classic and modern gameplay, that blends together well. You start the game by bringing Joker again to Arkham Asylum, but soon he breaks free and takes control of the entire island. The story in this game is superbly written, and the villains fantastic, like Scarecrow with fear gas, Poison Ivy with plants, and of course Joker, the main villain star. The gameplay is breaked into 3 types: exploration, where you progress through the asylum, discover new places, enjoy the graphics, relax, and find collectibles and solves riddles, with plenty of easter eggs. But not everything can be collected right away, you'll need to obtain new gadgets and come back later. The combat is simple and fluid, using a button to attack and another to counter mainly, with a few more tricks. But the enemies aren't varied, with only 2 or 3 that will require another tactic, and a mini-boss that's very recicled. Lastly there's the stealth sections, where you must plan and take down Joker goons in a room without being detected. It sounds cool, but it's more random than i would like. It's still enjoyable though. In the end, this isn't exactly an open world game, but more of a linear, focused story that works very well here, although it's a bit short. But after finishing the story and collecting everything, there's still the challenge mode, where you will face some combat challenges where you need to keep a combo to earn a high score, or face some stealth sections where you must take down Joker goons with some extra requirements. This challenges are harder than the story mode, but still doable. This game is a must buy on sale, but the game have crashed 2 times and there's a bug where the game exits if your internet connection gets cut off. This last one is annoying, because you will lose progress, and get frustrated. While this game no longer has DRM other than Steam, it seems that some code is still unintendedly present. But despite that it's still a great game, and while the core mechanics are much improved in Batman Arkham City, this one has the best story and villains, because it's more focused.			"

												With Batman being back in the film news I finally got the inspiration to start going through the Batman games. First on the list is Arkham Asylum, which is now over 5 years old. The good news is, the game didn't feel old at all. Looks and runs great!The game takes place in the island of Arkham Asylum where Joker and his mischievous friends escape and it's up to you to put an end to his plans. Featuring the original ""arkham style combat"" that is now a coined phrase for games like Shadow of Mordor, it plays well and is challenging enough to keep it interesting while providing some fun tools to experiment with.I do have a few complaints towards the options system. You can only edit your keys before starting the game and there is no option to edit mouse sensitivity. You have to go tweak some config files to change the sensitivity values around which is rather slow to finetune.Batman Arkham Asylum is a good game that functions well as an introduction to the series. It provides a fun and dark playground to mess around in. There's a good chunk of the core gameplay but also a bunch of collectibles and optional content that can keep you going longer if you so desire. Definitely checking out Arkham City next!Beat the game in 12 hours.			"

												Batman Arkham Asylum is an amazing, third person, action game. The gameplay is very fluent and fun once you get the hang of it, and I have absolutely no complaints about that. The gameplay is probably my favorite part about this game, the story on the other hand was interesting as well. The story seems to reflect the way the old Batman comics used to be, and definitely feels like a Batman story, which is good. Overall, the game is definitely worth the money and is loaded with hours of beating up criminals and grappling around the place. It did not feel very repetitive at all, in fact, it did a lot of things right to make sure you enjoy the game such as little hidden unlockables, different enemy types and environments, and fun bosses. Pick this game up right now if you can, or wait until a sale because it goes on sale pretty often.			"

												An amazing action game that is certainly not just for fans of Batman.  The story telling is top notch and features some very clever moments, the world fully realised and polished to perfection and the gameplay is engaging - especially combat, which is truely easy to learn and hard to master (and a requirement to beat all of the challenge rooms!).  Rocksteady went from an unkown to one of the finest British developers in the blink of an eye with this one.			"

												What is there to say about the famous Batman that has not already been said? Batman is my favorite hero, hands down. Maybe that makes me slightly biased in this review, but Batman: Arkham Asylum is exactly how a Batman game should be for long-time or even newly-born fans. I am not inclined to lie about him being a ""super"" hero, because he ultimately does not have super powers. His gadgets make him a super being, BUT he does not have super-human abilities, unlike his nemesises or other ""super"" heroes in likeness of Superman and whatnot. He drives a Batmobile; I mean, who does not love this guy? The two main parts about this game that stood out to me the most are not only the constant action throughout the entirety of the game (fighting mechanics, flying mechanics, and the like), but the Scarecrow and the Joker are what make this game what it is. Without spoiling the game for anyone who has not indulged in this experience yet, Scarecrow plays an epic part in this game; it is one of my favorite parts in gaming history. The Joker is hilarious; he kept me laughing consistently, which is a plus in any game. This game is stunning, graphics wise; the gameplay is absolutely one hundred pecent fun, one hundred percent of the time; the story-line is full of character, as there are an extensive amount of villians in it; basically, this game is perfection at its finest hour. Everything about it is exhilerating. Sometimes, more so than not, games are disappointing when they are hyped up, but this one is as pleasing as pie, unless you are into cake. It is not by any means a short game either, so if you enjoy a decent amount of gameplay, this is your match. You will not be disappointed, trust me! I have played over 1,000 + games, and this is one of my favorites.			"

												This game has been released for a long time and only at this time of my life I had the chance to play this game. And all I can say is ""Let's get this party started!""Ding d-ding, dong! First of all, I really love the environment and the character models, specifically on their details. Voice acting is also great, especially Mark Hamill[www.imdb.com]. Profoundly speaking, the perfect voice actor for Joker – ""He’s crazy, you know"" – but the secondary characters and enemy henchmen have poor variety in voice-overs. Speaking of henchmen, with the freeflow combat system you can really ”Eat punks like these for breakfast.” You can seamlessly chain together unlimited combos not just with your barehands but with your “bat prefixed"" gadgets as well. And speaking of gadgets, it’s pretty sweet if you will be able to utilize all of these in the game especially on solving the puzzles and of course with the help of the Detective Mode – I mean why wouldn’t Batman have a detective mode? He’s the WORLD’S GREATEST DETECTIVE! Plus to that, the hidden challenges and unlocking the secrets of Arkham Asylum really spice it up for Batman for being a detective. Another thing I also love is the silent takedowns – that pretty sums up Batman being the ""Dark Knight"" – and the convenience of hiding from the henchmen. They’ll just be surprised that you came out of nowhere and say, ""That guy freaks me out.” Well, I finished the game on normal. I’ll have another go on hard and see if it will be more difficult for me to hide from the henchmen. And the last thing is about the boss fights. It’s pretty good they have some different variations. But somehow, for me, they kinda seem littler easier than the fights with the mobs LOL. Especially the final battle!All in all it’s a 9/10! See you in Arkham City, Bats!

												Batman. Where the Series really starts. Rushable in under 8 hours. If you take your time, double it.A lot of collectibles ( Open World ) will keep you re-visiting the other parts of the Island.Got this game at 5 Euro, and i think it was worth it. Once you get used to the Combat, it goes quite fluently.Tip.: Rebind keys if you play with Keyboard + Mouse for K.O.Rating:7.5/10			"

												After playing this on console quite a lot, and being a big Batman and DC fan, I decided to buy this for PC.It captures Batman as for what he really is; a badass hardened by traumatic experiences and many close death encounters.The story is executed to a very good standard, encorporating a lot of the classic Batman villians such as the Joker (of course), Harley Quinn, Killer Croc, Scarecrow etc. It is also a rather simple story to understand as it features a standard plot to take over Gotham brought up the Joker, but in a way that truly shows off his evil genius.The combat is rather fluid, if not unimpressive but it works. You have the basic combo chaining attacks with an element of counters.The lack of some iconic characters such as Two-Face, Mr. Freeze and The Penguin allows the game to immersify the player into the other characters a lot more; making it feel not so crowded.Graphics are superb, with near to no lag found within my first few hours of playing, even when loading into the main island.There is an element of search and explore aspect, as you look to find certain Riddler Trophies as part of a sidequest to accompany the main story. There's also a stealth aspect as you look to avoid armed minions who can deal fatal damage, thus you have to intelligently pick your moment to take them out from above.The voice acting and audio in general is rather brilliant, with many voice actors reprising their roles from some of the older cartoons.The tone of the story is rather adult, as it should be for a Batman game. Featuring traumatic situations and murder.All in all, this is a good game I'd seriously recommend whether you're a Batman fan or not.			"

												I know I'm very late posting this review, but I'm going to do it anyway.TL;DR:Pros:- Smooth combat system (choice of beat-em-up or stealth)- Be the Batman. Use his gadgets.- Learn more Batman lore than you knew existed- Engaging and new plot- Dynamic Dialogue- Appealing art style and graphicsCons:- Controls on Mac were a little hard to get used to, but you can change your keyboard bindings, and I believe you also have the option of playing with a gamepad.Breezy's full review: Batman: Arkham Asylum is hands down the best video game based on a comic that I've ever played and one of the best games overall in my collection. I remember playing the demo at my local GameStop and being sort of skeptical as it just seemed like another beat-em-up. Flash forward to about 5 years later and I'm so glad that I was wrong.    The story is refreshing and encapsulating. The dialogue is great (a lot of times humorous, a lot of times epic, only sometimes corny). Like everyone else says, the combat system is the most fluid I've seen in a video game, though I much prefer the ""Predator"" style of combat (taking out enemies stealthily) in the game. Being the Batman and getting to use all his gadgets (Batclaw, Detective Mode, explosive gel, batarang (in the form of the normal, multiple, explosive, and remote controlled)), and appearances by both the Batmobile and the Batwing were definitely a treat.   I honestly have to say that the Riddler trophies were my favorite part of the game. When the trophies were first introduced in the game I really had no intention of collecting all 240 of them. But the developers did something very clever and linked character backgrounds to most of the trophies. Some of the trophies take the form of interview tapes with Arkham inmates, Chronicles of Arkham (cryptic messages left by Amadeus Arkham to be found and deciphered), or simply scanning the environment as a visual answer to one of the Riddler's riddles. Of course, there are actual trophies you can find, but I much prefered the ones that would provide some background on the characters. Before this game, I had minimal knowledge of the Batman universe. When I discovered that the trophies could actually unlock character bios (and some nice viewable character trophies), I became obsessed with finding them. Through the character bios and other various forms of the trophies, I became educated on more of the Batman universe than I thought I would want to know. But don't get me wrong, every detail about a character or asset in the Batman world interested more than the last.   Actual gameplay wise, I probably beat it in about 12-13 hours. However, as you can see from my hours played, I spent a lot more time in the game than that. What was I doing? Collecting trophies, of course. Also, I spent several hours in the challenge maps where you rack up points by seeing how long of a combo you can get on enemies or you complete predator challenges, where you must knock out enemies in a specific way (i.e. break through a glass ceiling to take out an enemy). The GOTY Edition DLC  offers you the choice of playing as the Joker in these challenge maps, and it's pretty awesome and a nice change of pace from playing as Batman. End note:My only real prior knowledge of Batman came after Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy and that was about the extent of it (besides watching a few episodes of the animated series growing up). The movies were great, expecially the Dark Knight, but they didn't really expand on the Batman universe, but instead focused on dark realism. This game, however, seemed to capture the wonder and atmosphere of the Batman comics and various animated series. I guess you could say that Batman has gained a Batfan. Thanks for reading.			"

												Superheroes have had issues with past video games, often being inaccurately portrayed or having  glitchy gameplay (I'm looking at you Superman 64). Thankfully though, this game isn't one of them. You've probably already heard all of the praises being sung over the Batman: Arkham series, so I'll keep this short: This game is amazing. Wonderful gameplay, fast-flowing action, a bunch of wacky characters to match wits against and enough challenges to keep you busy for quite a while. Oh, and you get to play as Batman of course.The game consists of Joker taking over Arkham Asylum and Batman having to stop him, battling inmates, rescuing guards and sneaking around taking down thugs in the most Batman ways possible.Just as the Dark Knight Trilogy defined Batman on film, the Arkham series defined Batman in games, setting a standard to which all future superhero games should aspire to.BE THE BATMAN ;)			"

After watching ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy by Christopher Nolan i started to get interested in the idea of Batman, so i bought this when it was on sale. Well, i can say that this, along with Deus Ex: HR, is by far one of the best purchases I ever made. You truly feel like a badass, that noone can stop, with all of his gear, it's the Batman game we ALL have been waiting for. I cannot wait to play Arkham City, hope that it will be as addicting as this, because i could't stop playing!			"

												Arkham's magnum opus (so far). Recognise but put aside the crisp combat and the fascinating villains. Making the setting a small, secluded island was the best decision they made. This linear approach meant they could make Batman the focal point rather than the world around him. The game simply made you feel like Batman with an agenda through its straightforwardness. Being devoid of trivial distractions like overly elaborate riddler challenges, ringing phone chases, frustrating AR training and silly ballon hunting only aided the game. Less is more in this instance. The definitive comic book superhero game.			"

												Batman AA is just a great game with very few flaws if any. I played it on the 360 and then got it for the PC to play it again. The gameplay is great combat is fluid. It also mixes together stealth objectives where you have to observe your surroundings before going in and trying to take guys down. The story is also really good with quality voice acting (you just can't beat Mark Hamill as the voice of the Joker). You don’t even need to be a really big Batman fan to enjoy this game, it is by far one of if not the best superhero game out there.			"

												The first in a great series This is the first of the Arkham sereis and it started a great game series that I enoyed all the way through. This is my least favorite of the 3 games I have palyed, but maybe that will change after I play Arham knight. who knows. This dose not mean that the game is bad, but it is the least original, in terms of story, and for me the story is one of the must important  thing for these games.The game is a exploration and fighting game, based in the batman universe. The good thing about this, is all of the vilans you get to see, since this game takes place inside Arkham Asylum witch is not really a prison but more like a psycority place, that will help bad guys to become good guys. The gameplay is split up into three major parts. There is the fighting part, witch is played out by using the right mouse button to hit a person, the right mouse button to counter, and the middle mouse button to confuse, you aim at a person by using the mouse, and you have to be fast to counter and hit, without getting hit youself. Along the game the enemyes get harder, and there must be used new tacktics to defeat them. You will also get more items along the way whitch will help you in combat.There is a part I don`t get with that logic. Along the way, Batman pics up equpment that he finds useful, but I raise the qeustion; whoulden`t it be better if you brang along your awesome gear to begin with? He gose through so many areas, where these items whould have helpt along the way, but they do this so you of couse can`t unlock everything right away.The secound game fetures is stealth, where you must use stealth, in order to take care of heavy eqeupt enemyes. Here you have to be patiencent and plan your strategie in order to not get spotted.The last part are some puzzels that the Riddler have scattered throughout Arkham. This is the best Riddler challenge acourding to me, and they are very cleaver made.The music in this game is very glomy and it`s good at setting the mood of this dark and dangourus palce. There are also challenges you can do outside of the main game, that can be fun to do now and again. The story is the best part of this game, after Batman captiers the Joker, the Joker escapes and make Arhkam run amok. This is a plan that the Joker have planed all along, whitch you will discover if you paly the game. Along the way, you are going to meet iconic Batman villans such as Bain, Killer Crock, Poison Ivy and Harly Quen. The most iconic boss to me was Scarecrow. that made you trip out and experince a wiered nightmare senario that made for some awseome scenes for the game.If you explore some of the Riddler chalenges, you get to know the story of a lot of diffrent Batman charecters, whitch is really cool.This game is really good, thumps up. 7 out of 10			"

												The gaming world was a different place before Arkham Asylum.  We had wanted a hero, a villain, nay anybody whose shoes we could step into and viscerally and believably beat the living crap outta people and feel like Jackie Chan.  Until Batman Arkham Asylum arrived, we didn't know just how badly we had been missing a game that could make you feel like billy big ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and boy did it deliver.  Gaming brawlers had come a long way since Streets of Rage and now they would never be the same again.  Indeed, this style of combat system has become the norm for 3rd person melee combat RPGs but not all manage to recreate the fluidity and satisfying perfection of Rocksteady's design.In my eyes, the combat is what makes this game.  Its freeflow design is so tactile, responsive and has fantastic, bone crunching feedback that it feels unbelievably satisfying.  With such a simple set of inputs (at least initially), the game encourages you to perfect timings and combos rather than simple button mashing, and the skill and complexity only rises as the Batman acquires more gadgets and skills himself.  The combat system is so well honed and refined that by the end of the game, a skilled player can launch feet first into a large group of henchmen and seamlessly take every last man down with well over 10 distinctly different moves, a variety of gadgets, dodges, blocks, stuns, jumps, kicks, punches, throws and numerous other martial art moves, all tied together into a 50 move combo without ever taking a single hit.  The end result is simply stunning to watch and pure joy incarnate to execute yourself.  To top it off, the skill balance is just about perfect as to do something like this is neither unrewardingly simplistic or frustratingly impossible.  Admittedly there is the very rare moment when the Batman doesn't mercilessly assault the particular henchman you intended him to and it throws off your combo as you try desperately to think ahead to the next limb mangling move, but this is so rare as to be no more than a petty annoyance.  The one thing I'm not so sure about though is that the Batman only seems to knock the goons out.  Now I've cracked some skulls as the Batman and I'm sure it's been well beyond the stresses and forces the human body can take, no matter how muscle bound the henchmen may be.  I'm pretty sure the Batman kills some people here.But Batman is so much more than the combat even though the game could probably stand up on its jaw crunching merits alone.  The other set of mechanics that play so perfectly into the theme and gameplay of Arkham Asylum is the Batman's ability for stealth and this really does enable you to approach situations in a variety of ways and is particularly great at enabling the Batman to take down enemies unawares or launch into combat with the element of surprise at hand.  Similarly to the combat, the Batman gains gadgets and skills that enable more advanced stealth techniques and takedowns and again enable the player to develop some quite complicated and nuanced tactics.  Combine these skills with the combat and here you have the perfect marriage of mechanics that makes you feel like the Batman more so than the vast majority of games make you feel like the intended protagonist.  That feeling of swinging from gargoyle to gargoyle before gliding down, batcape unfurled, onto a completely unsuspecting group of goons and perfectly beating them up in a flawless combo is quite simply, unmatched.Additionally, Arkham Asylum is a deep dive into who is, in my humble opinion, the greatest and most interesting super hero going, with a ton of lore and atmosphere that really makes you feel like you're not just the Batman but you really are walking through his world.  The plot is fantastic, although arguably shoe horns so many Batman villains into one place that it feels a little too dense at times but even this plays well into the compact setting of Arkham Asylum and the wider plot.  Overall, the presentation and content is outstanding with even the little extras, that are commonplace in free roam worlds, forming an interesting addition to the game and provide a view into Batman lore.  You can either take it or leave it, but at least it's not pointless fluff like so many other games seemingly have with audio logs that add sod all to the story or atmosphere.  These really do add a little bit of extra detail which as a Batman fan, I genuinely enjoyed.  Finally, it's the little details that I really noticed on my second playthrough on PC that just made me fall in love with the game again.  The wear and tear to the batsuit and the Batman himself as the night at Arkham progresses, and the five o' clock shadow that develops through the night just cements that feeling of immersion this game achieves so well and really makes you feel you're battling through a protracted nightmare of the Joker's design.A particular highlight for me is the voice acting which is just outstanding and not since Metal Gear 1 with David Hayter's rough, gravelly Solid Snake have I been so enamoured with the voice behind the mask.  Kevin Conroy as the Batman hits the nail on the head, returning to the glorious Michael Keaton style of Batman; unassuming, suave and charming richboy in a batsuit.  Arleen Sorkin is great as Harley Quinn, Wally Wingert pulls off a toned down Jim Carey style Riddler which I think strikes a great balance, and Dino Andrade as The Scarecrow is utterly menacing, matching his sinister presence in the game perfectly.  Perhaps Tom Hardy's Bane would have been the icing on the cake but the star performance undoubtedly goes to the legendary Mark Hamill of the Joker who plays him perfectly and creates a really interesting counterpoint to the Batman and helps deliver the whole game.I'm yet to play the remastered edition but rest assured, I certainly will and I'm looking forward to what will be my third playthrough.  This will undoubtedly go down as a classic of its generation and a mechanic defining game to boot.This review is from my website:  https://wingedtankard.wordpress.com/2017/04/03/batman-arkham-asylum/ "

The story is top notch, the focus never wains, the action never stops, and the atmosphere is arguably some of the strongest in gaming history. Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill are at the top of their game as Batman and The Joker, and every character feels like they popped right out of the comics and bring life to this magnificent piece of video game art. If you are a Batman fan, comic book fan, or action game fan, you owe it to yourselves to own Arkham Asylum! Period!			"

												This is my favorite game of all time. It holds a very special place in my heart. I played it when it came out on the PS3, and I fell in love. Batman was already my favorite comic book character, and this game made me really get into the comics. It's like playing a comic book. It's perfect in my opinion. I will say, the controls are kind of strange, as the counter-attack and the aim gadget are both right mouse, and in the middle of hand-to-hand combat, you'll pull out your currently equipped gadget and your combo will be broken, so beware of that. Besides that, no crashes on Windows 10 or anything. The game is superior on console, but this is still an awesome port. 10/10 Would be Batman again			"

Posted: July 4, 2016
												There are alot of things I like about this game, and may I don't. Let me go into a little more detail.What does it for me in this game is that it has the perfect atmosphere for a Batman game. It's dark, gritty, relistic, disturbing, etc. In other words, it is everything that a Batman story should be. Everything from the voice actors, to character design, to art style, it all perfectly encapsulates what I think of when I hear the word ""Batman"" or sit down to watch/play something related to the Dark Knight. Where this game really frustrated me, though, was the actual gameplay mechanics themselves. I have many gripes with it. I will organize my complaints into neat sections here.I felt the gadgets were rather lacking. There are only 5 main ones with others that you can get by buying special upgrades. However, they're all related to movement, mostly. First of all, you get the batarangs. The problem with them is that they suck. They can't be used to take down an enemy, only stun them for half a second, which isn't enough time to take enemies down before they recover and shoot you to death. It would have been much more fun to throw the batarangs like B-man does in the tv shows and movies: disarming henchmen or flat out knocking them out. Obviously this would make the game too easy because the batarangs are infinite, but an easy fix would have been to make the 'rangs limited in quanitity, and you pick them back up after a fight or something. This also would have made the game more realistic and added an element of strategical item management. The second gadget is an explosive spray that can be detonated at will. The problem with this gadget is it's rarely usuable in combat or stealth sections. It's pretty much only used to open up new areas for finding stupid riddler trophies or other pointless unlockables.The remaining gadgets I have no problem with in and of themselves. One is the batclaw, which is a firable hook that can pull objects or enemies to you. It's phenomenal when trying to carefully take out groups of gunmen, or even in basic melee combat. Another is a sonic sequencer, which can be used to hack things, is very useful, as well as provides a fun mini-game to counter-point the action. Lastly, there is a horizontal line gun which is solely for movement. Cool, but nothing spectacular.Overall, the game could have used a lot more gadgets, especially ones like the batclaw that have multiple uses in and outside of combat. I would have loved to see bolas, throwable smoke or flash pellets, or maybe that goo he throws on faces in the movies. Basically, stuff that breaks up the monotony of combat and provides alternative ways to take down gunmen without getting shot full of holes or just give an extra edge in melee (more on that later). What I'm getting is that I want to be able to do all the cool things that we consider iconic of Batman, rather than costing by soley on the batclaw.Which brings me to the next thing: melee combat. There are a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of parts where you're in a room and can't leave until you beat up all the thugs (like an arena shooter). I hated these parts because they aren't very interactive. You just click left mouse repeatedly to have Batman kick/punch guys. The game auto-manages all of this for you, having Batman jump wildly around the arena doing complicated moves and such. The only time the game requires player input is when you need to block (at which point an enemy gets a blue thing above his head and you're supposed to press right mouse to counter). Half the time though, Batman won't counter even if you do press right mouse, leading to some quite frustrating deaths or loss of combo points. The other problem with this system is because the game manages the combat for you, Batman could end up moving across the room to punch someone in an area you didn't want him to go (such as some kind of enviormental hazard you need to stay out of). Overall, you're going to get really frustrated at times due to lack of control, as well as just being bored. The only times this combat was fun was when they introduced special enemies that you couldn't take down just by left clicking, you have to do other things that require player input. However, these enemies were few and far between, the game electing to throw hordes of zombie-like regular henchmen at you most of the time. None of the gadgets were that useful in these sequences. It would have been nice to be able to use something to even the odds, or just make combat more dynamic, interactive, and tactical. Another thing I want to complain about is camera angles. Many times during boss battles, the camera angles suddenly shift on you and I found it annoying as absolute hell. It's supposed to make the game more ""cinematic"" or dramatic or something, but it just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. Suddenly all the directions are messed up so that foraward is actually right or something like that. Why couldn't they just keep the camera behind Batman's shoulder? It's not fun to die to something like that over and over.The last complaint is that they copy the premise of the baine fight over and over again. I can't really say more without doing spoilers, but just realize that there is one thing you will be doing over and over and over in this game.My final verdict is ""meh"". It's not too bad if you're a huge Batman fan like me, most likely you'll force yourself through it because you enjoy the characters. Also, it is an old game which you can most likely get cheap or even on sale. If this was a brand new title that wasn't related to the caped crusader, I would definitely give it a thumbs down.			"

												This game really makes you feel like you're the Batman. The combat is simple, but fluid and satisfying. Getting high combos while utilising Batman's gadgets feels so rewarding.There are some stealth areas in the game. The stealth mechanics are pretty good and many ways of taking down these armed enemies stealthily. These many ways of stealth takedowns are enabled by Batman's gadgets. So you can get creative during these stealth areas. Graphically Batman Arkham Asylum still looks good. Have to keep in mind this game initially released in 2009. The best part of Batman Arkham Asylum are the Riddler Challenges. Riddler has hidden many of his trophies and riddles around the island for you to find. If you are a Batman fan, then solving the Riddles will be very satisfying. I played this few years ago on the ps3 and now I played this on the PC. I still had fun with this game. So I would also recommend this game to people who already played this on the ps3 or xbox360.			"

												Batman: Arkham Asylum is simply a must-buy.It provides the perfect beginning to some of the most impressive Batman games we've come to see in recent years. From the innovative free-flow combat system to the gadget assisted stealth of the Silent Knight challenges. You'll see some nostalgic clashes with some of Gotham's most feared. Arkham Asylum places Batman into a gritty, intense and industrial-esque environment as he relentlessly pursues The Joker, whose murderous trail of havoc has laid waste to some of Arkham's finest. Batman is trapped, not just physically in the Arkham complex, but also by a sense of duty to stop this madman in his tracks. From hunting Riddler's tough-to-find Trophies, to exploring the Island, you'll be battling your way through hordes of inmates whilst using an array of gadgets and brutal martial arts.Be ready to be immersed in a well crafted storyline as you step into the Dark Knight's titanium boots. I'm excited for you because you're gonna' love every second you play...as well as every bone you shatter!    "

												Batman Arkham Asylum GOTY edtion was one amazing game, with flawless gameplay and compelling storyline. I am really taking my time savouring every single moment in this masterpiece. The game with all the DLC is spectacular especially because of the extra challenges. Batman would be proud.			"

												Overall, a wonderful game.They blend a few different types of challenges together. Most boss fights are pretty straight forward. The stealth sections give you many options on how you want to take out the enemies. And they are simply fun to play through.Even when you finish the story, there's still the task of finding all of Riddler's trophies.The story is well put together, bringing in a few of Batman's foes.And, of course, Mark Hamil as the Joker. Which is always a good decision.I've only played it with a controller, so I'm not sure how user friendly it is with a keyboard.In short, get this game. You won't be disappointed.			"

												Remember the broken launch of Arkham Knight and the marketing saying ""Be the Batman."" This and its sequel Arkham City ultimately do a better job of immersing you in the world of the Dark Knight. Unlike Arkham Knight this game runs well and feels like a competent port. I played through this game on PS3 and have picked it up here on Steam as well. The game is fairly linear in its structure but its narrative is tight as you explore the Arkham facility in an effort to thwart the Joker's nefarious plot. Along the way you will battle countless thugs who melt beneath well timed counters and combo attacks. The game has a nice balance of both melee combat as well as stealth sections that allow you to utilize Batman's various gadgets and tools. See a guard walking underneath where your perched on a Gargoyle? Drop down and sweep them up and let them hang. One of the more novel mechanics is a detective mode that has you scanning the environment for clues. Its also useful in detecting enemies and identifying their movement patterns. As you progress you earn XP which can then be used to unlock various upgrades. Speaking of Unlocks, the game has a hearty helping of them ranging from interview tapes to riddler challenges and trophies to find and collect. Being the first in the series its an excellent entry point for newcomers and bat fans alike.			"

												I played this on the 360 and loved it. Some years later I played it on the pc and still loved it.Pros: decent graphics, nice plot progression, reasonably good storyline, nice variety of settings (within reason, it is all set in the one place after all), no bugs or glitches that I found. And it makes you feel that you ARE Batman.Cons: If you boil it right down, you can virtually play the whole game just pressing the Y button on your controller and it can seem repetitive, but....IT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE BATMAN!! Worth buying just for that alone.(My only gripe with the game was that by the time I got some of the gadgets/upgrades, it was a bit late and I didn't really need them by then (but did earlier!) but that's just a personal thing).

												Always wanted to feel like a real Batman? There you go. Absolutely fantastic game. Combat system, stealth parts, story, atmosphere - everything is just great. The game offers at least 18 hours of gameplay and after you finish the campaign, you want to play it again. Even though the sequel - Arkham City - is newer and offers better gameplay, in my opinion the story and atmosphere is still better in Asylum.While the Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy represents contemporary Batman on the screen, Arkham series definitely represent Batman in video game sphere.Score: 10/10			"

												The must play for Batman fans. This game keep the dark atmosphere, comparable to Batman The Animated Series and picture Bruce Wayne as who he really is - a dramatic character. Map design are excellent, filled with little details and hidden secrets which are enriching the plot or telling additional story of some characters. Gunplay mechanics are amazing too, especially hand-to-hand combat which allow to create some crazy combos. The game require tactics, to takedown many enemies without anyone taking the notice which is very fun and Batman-like. To help that, player is presented with lots of iconic gadgets and tools.

												Ah yes, the one that started it all. Batman: Arkham Asylum. Or as I like to call it, Batman: Begins. Begins to actually make good Batman games that is! Man, I remeber playing Batman on the SNES and whoo boy, that a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I mean, it was pretty damn bad. You didn't know what to do half the ♥♥♥♥ing time and the graphics looked liked somone was trying to make an homage to the earlier Mortal Kombat games(I thought they were better to be honest). So granted, my first experience with a batman game with 2-D fighting controls was a bummer. Lo and behold though, it would be years later when the DC franchise would pull itself up by the bootstraps and finally implement a fighting scheme that would not only complement the amount of enemies on screen, but also give inspiration to other games later as well. Not saying it's wholly original, nothing ever is, but it did refine it and give it nice shoe polish. Punching feels good and your attacks have impact. You actually FEEL like a super-duper detective in a skin tight suit(Schumacher fans will be disappointed), enacting your hero fantasies of yore. I never really thought stealth could be done in a batman game, but Rocksteady has proven me wrong. Takedowns from the highest perches to the lowlyest floor grate always feel smooth and satisfying. Snipers feel a bit cheap though, even when you're busy doing doing full nelsons to avoid enemy fire, or when you unexpectantly got shot from the back because you didn't see somone line up a perfectly placed shot in the guard tower adjacent to you. In short, it's a short game; took my only about 7-8 hours to beat, but well worth the experience. If you enjoyed Kevin Conroy in the 90's Batman animated show, bleed your fan-boy heart out.			"

												Batman: Arkham Asylum is not only an excellent Batman game; it is an excellent game. Structured as a metroidivania, Batman AA offers a refined gameplay formula of the genre. Everything is finely tuned, the pacing, the encounters, the story segments and it all fits together nicely in what is probably the best game of 2009. Unreal Engine 3 is put to good use as the game looks very good. The free flow combat engine makes use of contextual animations and at the time of the game's release it was groundbreaking. The original voice actors of Batman and the Joker are used in the game. All in all, this is THE best superhero game ever released, in my opinion. If you want to be Batman, play Arkham Asylum.			"

												I'm not even a big fan of Batman (the only thing I was fan of is was the first 2 movies of the Dark Knight Trilogy and the animated series) but still the game got me hooked from the first moments. Those Batman and Joker voices, the totally spot on atmosphere, the combat (that was a bit clunky at times, specially to evade enemy) and the villains, gosh...The game succeeds in making you feel like the badass Batman is, the gadgets are great and stealth is really good but a little to forgiving and easy maybe. The story is really good and hearing Joker throughout the game was really interesting haha.Only problems I have with the game is that the combat and stealth mechanics felt a little unpolished in some parts (but very minimal), I sometimes climb a ledge I didn't want to or jump down from one and it was hard to even some enemies. Still awesome game, I'm sure every batman fan would love it. Also I didn't bother with the Riddler trophies, nothing really good to collect.After playing Arkham City this falls short (because AC is practically perfect haha) but still this deserve 8/10 for me even by comparison because it was revolutionary and made me want to know more about the lore but even the first time I played it I felt like it needed more gadgets and more enemy variation (which the sequel provided).

												I wasn't sure what to expect before playing Arkham Asylum and now I don't regret having staarted! It's a great game all-around: great graphics, great sound design, battle animations are pretty cool and there are lots of objectives in the game. Storyline is great too and keeps you hooked as you progress. The only thing I point as less positive is combats being a little repetitive, since your combat skill set is a little limited. On the other hand, stealth parts where you should clear a room undetected are challenging and in some cases you have to be quite resourceful to finish them perfectly.It's a game that I'd definitely would recommend anyone to play!

												The gaming world was a different place before Arkham Asylum.  We had wanted a hero, a villain, nay anybody whose shoes we could step into and viscerally and believably beat the living crap outta people and feel like Jackie Chan.  Until Batman Arkham Asylum arrived, we didn't know just how badly we had been missing a game that could make you feel like billy big ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and boy did it deliver.  Gaming brawlers had come a long way since Streets of Rage and now they would never be the same again.  Indeed, this style of combat system has become the norm for 3rd person melee combat RPGs but not all manage to recreate the fluidity and satisfying perfection of Rocksteady's design.In my eyes, the combat is what makes this game.  Its freeflow design is so tactile, responsive and has fantastic, bone crunching feedback that it feels unbelievably satisfying.  With such a simple set of inputs (at least initially), the game encourages you to perfect timings and combos rather than simple button mashing, and the skill and complexity only rises as the Batman acquires more gadgets and skills himself.  The combat system is so well honed and refined that by the end of the game, a skilled player can launch feet first into a large group of henchmen and seamlessly take every last man down with well over 10 distinctly different moves, a variety of gadgets, dodges, blocks, stuns, jumps, kicks, punches, throws and numerous other martial art moves, all tied together into a 50 move combo without ever taking a single hit.  The end result is simply stunning to watch and pure joy incarnate to execute yourself.  To top it off, the skill balance is just about perfect as to do something like this is neither unrewardingly simplistic or frustratingly impossible.  Admittedly there is the very rare moment when the Batman doesn't mercilessly assault the particular henchman you intended him to and it throws off your combo as you try desperately to think ahead to the next limb mangling move, but this is so rare as to be no more than a petty annoyance.  The one thing I'm not so sure about though is that the Batman only seems to knock the goons out.  Now I've cracked some skulls as the Batman and I'm sure it's been well beyond the stresses and forces the human body can take, no matter how muscle bound the henchmen may be.  I'm pretty sure the Batman kills some people here.But Batman is so much more than the combat even though the game could probably stand up on its jaw crunching merits alone.  The other set of mechanics that play so perfectly into the theme and gameplay of Arkham Asylum is the Batman's ability for stealth and this really does enable you to approach situations in a variety of ways and is particularly great at enabling the Batman to take down enemies unawares or launch into combat with the element of surprise at hand.  Similarly to the combat, the Batman gains gadgets and skills that enable more advanced stealth techniques and takedowns and again enable the player to develop some quite complicated and nuanced tactics.  Combine these skills with the combat and here you have the perfect marriage of mechanics that makes you feel like the Batman more so than the vast majority of games make you feel like the intended protagonist.  That feeling of swinging from gargoyle to gargoyle before gliding down, batcape unfurled, onto a completely unsuspecting group of goons and perfectly beating them up in a flawless combo is quite simply, unmatched.Additionally, Arkham Asylum is a deep dive into who is, in my humble opinion, the greatest and most interesting super hero going, with a ton of lore and atmosphere that really makes you feel like you're not just the Batman but you really are walking through his world.  The plot is fantastic, although arguably shoe horns so many Batman villains into one place that it feels a little too dense at times but even this plays well into the compact setting of Arkham Asylum and the wider plot.  Overall, the presentation and content is outstanding with even the little extras, that are commonplace in free roam worlds, forming an interesting addition to the game and provide a view into Batman lore.  You can either take it or leave it, but at least it's not pointless fluff like so many other games seemingly have with audio logs that add sod all to the story or atmosphere.  These really do add a little bit of extra detail which as a Batman fan, I genuinely enjoyed.  Finally, it's the little details that I really noticed on my second playthrough on PC that just made me fall in love with the game again.  The wear and tear to the batsuit and the Batman himself as the night at Arkham progresses, and the five o' clock shadow that develops through the night just cements that feeling of immersion this game achieves so well and really makes you feel you're battling through a protracted nightmare of the Joker's design.A particular highlight for me is the voice acting which is just outstanding and not since Metal Gear 1 with David Hayter's rough, gravelly Solid Snake have I been so enamoured with the voice behind the mask.  Kevin Conroy as the Batman hits the nail on the head, returning to the glorious Michael Keaton style of Batman; unassuming, suave and charming richboy in a batsuit.  Arleen Sorkin is great as Harley Quinn, Wally Wingert pulls off a toned down Jim Carey style Riddler which I think strikes a great balance, and Dino Andrade as The Scarecrow is utterly menacing, matching his sinister presence in the game perfectly.  Perhaps Tom Hardy's Bane would have been the icing on the cake but the star performance undoubtedly goes to the legendary Mark Hamill of the Joker who plays him perfectly and creates a really interesting counterpoint to the Batman and helps deliver the whole game.I'm yet to play the remastered edition but rest assured, I certainly will and I'm looking forward to what will be my third playthrough.  This will undoubtedly go down as a classic of its generation and a mechanic defining game to boot.This review is from my website:  https://wingedtankard.wordpress.com/2017/04/03/batman-arkham-asylum/ "

												You are the Batman. What more needs to be said? Arkham Asylum does a wonderful job in capturing the essence of the Dark Knight as you battle your way through various villains to regain control of the island.  While it will feel repetitive at times, you will beat groups of baddies to a pulp or pick them off one-by-one. In addition, you can scratch you world's greatest detective itch by solving Riddler challenges. Of course, the voice work of Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill complete the immersion. The free-flow combat system probably works best with controller but keyboard and mouse will function. While you will indeed feel powerful enough to take on hordes of enemies, at times it will be frustrating (particularly for challenges) when the game has trouble figuring out who you are trying to target. This becomes more noticeable during some boss fights when you cannot control the camera.The stealth portions of the game are the highlight. Sometimes there will be an instant fail state, but most of the time you are able to plot out (thanks to the x-ray power of detective vision) the manner in which to clear a room. Nothing like dropping down from a gargoyle and stinging up a thug, then counter circling the enemies and picking them off as they try to help their comrade. Riddler Challenges are puzzles and collectibles which provide optional puzzles and collectibles for you to hunt down providing lore for many characters as well as recordings of psychological sessions.  Some of these will require exploration and back-tracking but they are optional. There is also a leveling-up system to increase abilities and health, but this is not a skill tree, so it does not allow for customization.You can expect to spend 20-30 hours to complete the game (and one playthrough will probably be enough). While not a challenging game, at at times repetitive, it is a worthwhile experience even for the non-Batman fan as a lot of care went into creating this game.			"

												TLDR: Play as the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Batman sneaking around Arkham Island punching bad guys in the face. Excellent story, game mechanics, and voice acting. All around awesome game.  9.5/10Batman Arkham Asylum is one of the first great comic book games that I’ve played. In fact, the Arkham series is the only comic game series that springs to mind other than the various Spider-man games which were fun, but had serious technical problems. This game came out around the time of the second Christian Bale Batman movie, but has a completely different story and probably follows the comic / animated series much closer. But unlike in cartoons, people die in Arkham Asylum… a lot of them.*Story spoilers*When the game begins, Batman has captured Joker and is transporting him to the asylum on Arkham Island, where the criminally insane are kept separated from the people of Gotham City.  In a peculiar coincidence, a recent fire at the Blackgate prison in Gotham has caused hundreds of additional criminals to be temporarily housed in Arkham Asylum. So not only are there a bunch of super criminals (Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, Scarecrow, etc.) there’re also hundreds of Joker’s minions all in the same place. Of course it’s all a set up, and Joker is now exactly where he wants to be, king of the lunatics running the asylum.Batman Arkham Asylum is played in the third person perspective on a relatively small “open world” map. You can probably run across the length of the island in less than 10 minutes, but a lot of the action takes place indoors (buildings bigger on the inside than outside). You can play Arkham Asylum like a stealth game for a lot of the encounters, but when it comes time to fight, the combat system is generally hand to hand punching, similar to Sleeping Dogs.  You have a utility belt full of tools and weapons but your greatest advantage in battle is the “counter” where you hit the counter button when you see an enemy about to attack, and Batman will automatically reverse the enemy attack and put the attacker in his place. This basically means that while you’re kicking and punching your enemies into submission, you are practically immune to damage if you always counter in time. There could be 20 bad guys and they wouldn’t touch you if you keep an eye on the attack warnings and have decent reflexes. Bosses are a different story though, and they add some variety to the mix.Pros:+Excellent story and voice acting, particularly for the Joker who is your main enemy taunting you from behind his army of thugs. A lot of familiar Batman enemies also show up to waylay you. The Scarecrow sections are probably my favorite story-wise.+The combat and movement (gliding) mechanics are very well done. You can move through the maps with ease aided by your “detective mode” which is an augmented reality vision where you can see enemies through walls and detect interactive objects in the world. It’s kind of similar to the Thief 2014 “focus” or the Tomb Raider 2013 “survivor instinct.” The only drawback is that it turns your vision into a kind of x-ray type enhanced imaging, and you don’t see the well-drawn details of the world around you. I probably spent about half the game in detective mode. Cons:-Nothing really… unless you hate collecting objects after finishing a game’s campaign story. There are a ton of Riddler “puzzles” and collectibles to be found all over the island. By the time you finish the game’s story you will probably be about 50% complete according to the game’s progress meter. To get 100% you pretty much have to find every collectible and beat every “challenge map.”Overall, Batman Arkham Asylum is a game everyone should play, if only to prove to yourself that awesome comic book video games are possible. The game was bundled in the Humble WB bundle a year or so ago and shouldn’t be hard to find at under $5. The Game of the Year edition (the only one Steam carries) has additional skins and challenge maps, but no extra campaign.  "

												For a long time i have been putting off playing the Batman: Arkham games, idk why but I just have, so recently I decided that I wanted to finally sit down and play through them all, so obviously I saw it fit to play through the games as they were released. Batman: Arkham Asylum, is a great game, though fairly linear. (it is techincally ""open world"" but basically keeps you on the path of the story line, exploration is basically just to find riddler secrets) that being said the story is very interesting and will keep you hooked for your whole playthough, although it will not take very long at all to finish, just shy of 11 hours and thats including taking time to stealhfully take out the enemies one by one, and going off ocassionally to back track to a riddler secret that at the time I first noticed it I didn't have the right gadget to get it. So the game is short but is for sure worth playing through! With the game being almost 7 years old the graphics are very beautiful and the characters look detailed and wonderful. Note that this game does have an fps cap at 62 fps (I know strange, why not just 60?), so don't be expecting to get 200 and so on here, but that doesn't matter. the game plays smooth the whole way through and no problems with crashing or any of the sort! So happy I got around to playing this game and know I understand all the hype surrounding this series!			"

												This isn't the kind of game I'd usually try out, but having picked it up cheap I decided to give it a go. Overall it turned out to be a great experience. A great game with a lot of variation between the different modes and situations Batman finds himself in. I especially liked the stealth missions and riddle solving. The combat was more of a mixed bag, and I found myself sincerely hating several of the fights, mostly the titan hencman fights, which I found a lot harder than most of the boss fights. Doing those fights with a mouse and keyboard was useless, requiring me to connect a game controller to my system for the first time ever. With the controller, those fights were doable (but still frustrating), but playing the rest of the game with it was really awkward. In the end I ended up switching between mouse/keyboard and controller as the situations saw fit. More or less requiring a controller to complete the game is a big drawback in my book, but overall this game still deserves a recommendation.			"

												Batman: Arkham Asylum is not only an excellent Batman game; it is an excellent game. Structured as a metroidivania, Batman AA offers a refined gameplay formula of the genre. Everything is finely tuned, the pacing, the encounters, the story segments and it all fits together nicely in what is probably the best game of 2009. Unreal Engine 3 is put to good use as the game looks very good. The free flow combat engine makes use of contextual animations and at the time of the game's release it was groundbreaking. The original voice actors of Batman and the Joker are used in the game. All in all, this is THE best superhero game ever released, in my opinion. If you want to be Batman, play Arkham Asylum.			"

												Always wanted to feel like a real Batman? There you go. Absolutely fantastic game. Combat system, stealth parts, story, atmosphere - everything is just great. The game offers at least 18 hours of gameplay and after you finish the campaign, you want to play it again. Even though the sequel - Arkham City - is newer and offers better gameplay, in my opinion the story and atmosphere is still better in Asylum.While the Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy represents contemporary Batman on the screen, Arkham series definitely represent Batman in video game sphere.Score: 10/10			"

												When I bought this game, I thought it would be funny to write a review of this game with just the words ""I'm batman"", but after playing, I realized that this game deserves a better review. So let me sum up a few pros and cons of this game.under these pros and cons I will explain them a little.+nice storyline+decent controlls+third person view+character bios+nice graphics+variation of opponenents+amazing joker+second batcave?+riddles+decent voiceacting+after-death-cutscenes-stable internet connection required-last bossfightHere the more in-depth explaination:The pros:The reason why I like the storyline is because you can see that the developers thought about it. the Joker pretty much creates some fun in the game while you're busy fighting his little ♥♥♥♥♥es.When I first saw the controlls, I thought they were somewhat odd, but after half an hour of playing I understood why they were made this way, and they actually feel really nice once used to it.I usually prefer to play games in first person view, but the third person view really fits this game. That way you can anticipate on attacks of henchmen and you will be able to counter them. It's also just nice to see the movements of Batman's cape.Another nice feature of this game is the character bios. The developers wrote a small background of pretty much every important character in the game. It also shows some facts of the characters, like when they first appeared and what their real names are (if known). But most of all I like the character bios because of the interview tapes you can collect in the game. They are quite funny and give you a little more information.Even though I played this game on a laptop with an intel pentium 4 processor and an on-board videocard, the game looked really great. Better than I expected.Another cool thing is that the Joker is not your only oppononent. You will also come across Harley Quinn, Scarecrow, The Croc, Poison Ivy, Bane, and Victor Zsasz. All of those have to be fought in another way, which brings some variation in the game. They also have different types of henchmen. The unarmed will have to be fought directly and with brute force, while the armed will have to be approached sneaky. There is also a difference between unarmed henchmen. Some will be really unarmed, while others use knives or kind of tasers. I also really love this Joker. They created him like a combination of Heath Ledger and the guy who played the Joker before him. Some may like it, some may not, but since this game is not in Gotham, Batman will not have it's batcave in this game. To give the feeling of a batcave, the developers made a secret second batcave on Arkham Island.To make it a little harder to complete this game, they created some riddles. Some are easy to solve, but since there are more than 200 riddles, you might take a while to actually solve all of them, mainly because most of them are actually not easy to solve.I'm a guy who loves to hear things and does a lot with his ears, so I hate it when there are crappy voiceactors in a game. Batman: Arkham Asylum actually uses decent actors, which makes it a lot more nice to play for people like me.In a lot of games you die, and you just resurrect, but in Batman: Arkham Asylum you die, and you get a little cutscene from an opponent, who's captured you and acts like he's about to kill you, which makes it less boring to die.Now the cons:When you play this game with an unstable connection, the game will suddenly stop once the connection is lost, and it will bring you back to the main menu. This caused me to start over a few times. It's really annoying when this happens mid-bossfight, because you will have to do everything from the bossfight once again. A serious problem which shouldn't be necessary since this is not an online game. The last bossfight against the Joker is pretty dull in my opinion. you pretty much have to do the same thing 3 times which is not really something the Joker would let you do.I overall rate this game 9.3/10			"

												The gaming world was a different place before Arkham Asylum.  We had wanted a hero, a villain, nay anybody whose shoes we could step into and viscerally and believably beat the living crap outta people and feel like Jackie Chan.  Until Batman Arkham Asylum arrived, we didn't know just how badly we had been missing a game that could make you feel like billy big ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and boy did it deliver.  Gaming brawlers had come a long way since Streets of Rage and now they would never be the same again.  Indeed, this style of combat system has become the norm for 3rd person melee combat RPGs but not all manage to recreate the fluidity and satisfying perfection of Rocksteady's design.In my eyes, the combat is what makes this game.  Its freeflow design is so tactile, responsive and has fantastic, bone crunching feedback that it feels unbelievably satisfying.  With such a simple set of inputs (at least initially), the game encourages you to perfect timings and combos rather than simple button mashing, and the skill and complexity only rises as the Batman acquires more gadgets and skills himself.  The combat system is so well honed and refined that by the end of the game, a skilled player can launch feet first into a large group of henchmen and seamlessly take every last man down with well over 10 distinctly different moves, a variety of gadgets, dodges, blocks, stuns, jumps, kicks, punches, throws and numerous other martial art moves, all tied together into a 50 move combo without ever taking a single hit.  The end result is simply stunning to watch and pure joy incarnate to execute yourself.  To top it off, the skill balance is just about perfect as to do something like this is neither unrewardingly simplistic or frustratingly impossible.  Admittedly there is the very rare moment when the Batman doesn't mercilessly assault the particular henchman you intended him to and it throws off your combo as you try desperately to think ahead to the next limb mangling move, but this is so rare as to be no more than a petty annoyance.  The one thing I'm not so sure about though is that the Batman only seems to knock the goons out.  Now I've cracked some skulls as the Batman and I'm sure it's been well beyond the stresses and forces the human body can take, no matter how muscle bound the henchmen may be.  I'm pretty sure the Batman kills some people here.But Batman is so much more than the combat even though the game could probably stand up on its jaw crunching merits alone.  The other set of mechanics that play so perfectly into the theme and gameplay of Arkham Asylum is the Batman's ability for stealth and this really does enable you to approach situations in a variety of ways and is particularly great at enabling the Batman to take down enemies unawares or launch into combat with the element of surprise at hand.  Similarly to the combat, the Batman gains gadgets and skills that enable more advanced stealth techniques and takedowns and again enable the player to develop some quite complicated and nuanced tactics.  Combine these skills with the combat and here you have the perfect marriage of mechanics that makes you feel like the Batman more so than the vast majority of games make you feel like the intended protagonist.  That feeling of swinging from gargoyle to gargoyle before gliding down, batcape unfurled, onto a completely unsuspecting group of goons and perfectly beating them up in a flawless combo is quite simply, unmatched.Additionally, Arkham Asylum is a deep dive into who is, in my humble opinion, the greatest and most interesting super hero going, with a ton of lore and atmosphere that really makes you feel like you're not just the Batman but you really are walking through his world.  The plot is fantastic, although arguably shoe horns so many Batman villains into one place that it feels a little too dense at times but even this plays well into the compact setting of Arkham Asylum and the wider plot.  Overall, the presentation and content is outstanding with even the little extras, that are commonplace in free roam worlds, forming an interesting addition to the game and provide a view into Batman lore.  You can either take it or leave it, but at least it's not pointless fluff like so many other games seemingly have with audio logs that add sod all to the story or atmosphere.  These really do add a little bit of extra detail which as a Batman fan, I genuinely enjoyed.  Finally, it's the little details that I really noticed on my second playthrough on PC that just made me fall in love with the game again.  The wear and tear to the batsuit and the Batman himself as the night at Arkham progresses, and the five o' clock shadow that develops through the night just cements that feeling of immersion this game achieves so well and really makes you feel you're battling through a protracted nightmare of the Joker's design.A particular highlight for me is the voice acting which is just outstanding and not since Metal Gear 1 with David Hayter's rough, gravelly Solid Snake have I been so enamoured with the voice behind the mask.  Kevin Conroy as the Batman hits the nail on the head, returning to the glorious Michael Keaton style of Batman; unassuming, suave and charming richboy in a batsuit.  Arleen Sorkin is great as Harley Quinn, Wally Wingert pulls off a toned down Jim Carey style Riddler which I think strikes a great balance, and Dino Andrade as The Scarecrow is utterly menacing, matching his sinister presence in the game perfectly.  Perhaps Tom Hardy's Bane would have been the icing on the cake but the star performance undoubtedly goes to the legendary Mark Hamill of the Joker who plays him perfectly and creates a really interesting counterpoint to the Batman and helps deliver the whole game.I'm yet to play the remastered edition but rest assured, I certainly will and I'm looking forward to what will be my third playthrough.  This will undoubtedly go down as a classic of its generation and a mechanic defining game to boot.This review is from my website:  https://wingedtankard.wordpress.com/2017/04/03/batman-arkham-asylum/ "

												This is where it all began - most likely the coolest superhero game series ever, even with the problems it suffered later (the not exactly innovative Origins, and the buggy launch of AK). And what a start it was! Even today, the game looks really dang good, and the atmosphere rocks still! Don't be misled by my low number of hours... I did buy this game when it came out (back then, still with the horrible Windows Live system), and played it like crazy, and just was given AA and AC for free because I bought AK a while ago, and just started replaying this one AGAIN. And it still is one of the best entries in the series. AC might be bigger, AK more technically advanced, the other games have more gadgets and stuff, but this still has such a great vibe to it, and a cool story. The intro (even though it gets a bit long on your 2nd, 3rd, ... playthrough) is a great start, and off you go, exploring the huge Asylum, which is split up into different segments.You can focus on the story and go for that mostly, or you can try to find all the Riddler secrets and interrogation tapes, which will tell you more about the villains.If you have played any of the more recent ACs, Shadow Of Mordor or any of the newer Batman games, the gameplay will be fun, and you will be familiar with the controls. Hitting, combos, blocking, etc. The game runs perfectly well on my system, and I think that you really SHOULD get it if you haven't tried it yet, especially when it is on sale. One of the coolest games of the recent years, a totally great entry to the Batman-franchise (the game really does justice to the Batman we all love... the cool, enigmatic, torn, threatening one), it still looks great and is fun, and there are some very cool moments in there, especially those that are related to the fear toxin. The boss fights might be more varied and interesting in later games, but still, they are fun in this one (and less ""waaayy too long"" than they were in Origins), and I think it's decently challenging...and a ton of fun.If you love Batman, or the games I mentioned above, if you wanna see how the Arkham-franchise began with a killer game, get this game! Right now, during the xmas sale, its five Euros, so GET IT!Pros:- Runs perfect, even on highest settings, and has aged very well- Still looks great- Awesome atmosphere and voice-acting- Challenging yet not unfair- Some great sequences and writing- Fun combat- Some VERY creative scenes. Killer Croc's Lair was one of my favorites, as it was very suspenseful. Cons:- Boss fights are not as varied as in later games, ymmvYMMV: The game is pretty short...I finished the whole story in 8 hours on this playthrough. Didnt do any challenges, and didn't find all ridler-icons, but focused mainly on the story. However, better 8 hours of a great game than 60 hours with tons of repetition and filler, right?It was VERY VERY enjoyable, but some may find it too short, or too linear... the storyline dictates where you go, and the Asylum is segmented, not as open as AC. Still, an AWESOME game even today, and if you can get it for a low prize, don't hesitate!			"

												You are the Batman. What more needs to be said? Arkham Asylum does a wonderful job in capturing the essence of the Dark Knight as you battle your way through various villains to regain control of the island.  While it will feel repetitive at times, you will beat groups of baddies to a pulp or pick them off one-by-one. In addition, you can scratch you world's greatest detective itch by solving Riddler challenges. Of course, the voice work of Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill complete the immersion. The free-flow combat system probably works best with controller but keyboard and mouse will function. While you will indeed feel powerful enough to take on hordes of enemies, at times it will be frustrating (particularly for challenges) when the game has trouble figuring out who you are trying to target. This becomes more noticeable during some boss fights when you cannot control the camera.The stealth portions of the game are the highlight. Sometimes there will be an instant fail state, but most of the time you are able to plot out (thanks to the x-ray power of detective vision) the manner in which to clear a room. Nothing like dropping down from a gargoyle and stinging up a thug, then counter circling the enemies and picking them off as they try to help their comrade. Riddler Challenges are puzzles and collectibles which provide optional puzzles and collectibles for you to hunt down providing lore for many characters as well as recordings of psychological sessions.  Some of these will require exploration and back-tracking but they are optional. There is also a leveling-up system to increase abilities and health, but this is not a skill tree, so it does not allow for customization.You can expect to spend 20-30 hours to complete the game (and one playthrough will probably be enough). While not a challenging game, at at times repetitive, it is a worthwhile experience even for the non-Batman fan as a lot of care went into creating this game.			"

												TLDR: Play as the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Batman sneaking around Arkham Island punching bad guys in the face. Excellent story, game mechanics, and voice acting. All around awesome game.  9.5/10Batman Arkham Asylum is one of the first great comic book games that I’ve played. In fact, the Arkham series is the only comic game series that springs to mind other than the various Spider-man games which were fun, but had serious technical problems. This game came out around the time of the second Christian Bale Batman movie, but has a completely different story and probably follows the comic / animated series much closer. But unlike in cartoons, people die in Arkham Asylum… a lot of them.*Story spoilers*When the game begins, Batman has captured Joker and is transporting him to the asylum on Arkham Island, where the criminally insane are kept separated from the people of Gotham City.  In a peculiar coincidence, a recent fire at the Blackgate prison in Gotham has caused hundreds of additional criminals to be temporarily housed in Arkham Asylum. So not only are there a bunch of super criminals (Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, Scarecrow, etc.) there’re also hundreds of Joker’s minions all in the same place. Of course it’s all a set up, and Joker is now exactly where he wants to be, king of the lunatics running the asylum.Batman Arkham Asylum is played in the third person perspective on a relatively small “open world” map. You can probably run across the length of the island in less than 10 minutes, but a lot of the action takes place indoors (buildings bigger on the inside than outside). You can play Arkham Asylum like a stealth game for a lot of the encounters, but when it comes time to fight, the combat system is generally hand to hand punching, similar to Sleeping Dogs.  You have a utility belt full of tools and weapons but your greatest advantage in battle is the “counter” where you hit the counter button when you see an enemy about to attack, and Batman will automatically reverse the enemy attack and put the attacker in his place. This basically means that while you’re kicking and punching your enemies into submission, you are practically immune to damage if you always counter in time. There could be 20 bad guys and they wouldn’t touch you if you keep an eye on the attack warnings and have decent reflexes. Bosses are a different story though, and they add some variety to the mix.Pros:+Excellent story and voice acting, particularly for the Joker who is your main enemy taunting you from behind his army of thugs. A lot of familiar Batman enemies also show up to waylay you. The Scarecrow sections are probably my favorite story-wise.+The combat and movement (gliding) mechanics are very well done. You can move through the maps with ease aided by your “detective mode” which is an augmented reality vision where you can see enemies through walls and detect interactive objects in the world. It’s kind of similar to the Thief 2014 “focus” or the Tomb Raider 2013 “survivor instinct.” The only drawback is that it turns your vision into a kind of x-ray type enhanced imaging, and you don’t see the well-drawn details of the world around you. I probably spent about half the game in detective mode. Cons:-Nothing really… unless you hate collecting objects after finishing a game’s campaign story. There are a ton of Riddler “puzzles” and collectibles to be found all over the island. By the time you finish the game’s story you will probably be about 50% complete according to the game’s progress meter. To get 100% you pretty much have to find every collectible and beat every “challenge map.”Overall, Batman Arkham Asylum is a game everyone should play, if only to prove to yourself that awesome comic book video games are possible. The game was bundled in the Humble WB bundle a year or so ago and shouldn’t be hard to find at under $5. The Game of the Year edition (the only one Steam carries) has additional skins and challenge maps, but no extra campaign.  "

												The first in a great series This is the first of the Arkham sereis and it started a great game series that I enoyed all the way through. This is my least favorite of the 3 games I have palyed, but maybe that will change after I play Arham knight. who knows. This dose not mean that the game is bad, but it is the least original, in terms of story, and for me the story is one of the must important  thing for these games.The game is a exploration and fighting game, based in the batman universe. The good thing about this, is all of the vilans you get to see, since this game takes place inside Arkham Asylum witch is not really a prison but more like a psycority place, that will help bad guys to become good guys. The gameplay is split up into three major parts. There is the fighting part, witch is played out by using the right mouse button to hit a person, the right mouse button to counter, and the middle mouse button to confuse, you aim at a person by using the mouse, and you have to be fast to counter and hit, without getting hit youself. Along the game the enemyes get harder, and there must be used new tacktics to defeat them. You will also get more items along the way whitch will help you in combat.There is a part I don`t get with that logic. Along the way, Batman pics up equpment that he finds useful, but I raise the qeustion; whoulden`t it be better if you brang along your awesome gear to begin with? He gose through so many areas, where these items whould have helpt along the way, but they do this so you of couse can`t unlock everything right away.The secound game fetures is stealth, where you must use stealth, in order to take care of heavy eqeupt enemyes. Here you have to be patiencent and plan your strategie in order to not get spotted.The last part are some puzzels that the Riddler have scattered throughout Arkham. This is the best Riddler challenge acourding to me, and they are very cleaver made.The music in this game is very glomy and it`s good at setting the mood of this dark and dangourus palce. There are also challenges you can do outside of the main game, that can be fun to do now and again. The story is the best part of this game, after Batman captiers the Joker, the Joker escapes and make Arhkam run amok. This is a plan that the Joker have planed all along, whitch you will discover if you paly the game. Along the way, you are going to meet iconic Batman villans such as Bain, Killer Crock, Poison Ivy and Harly Quen. The most iconic boss to me was Scarecrow. that made you trip out and experince a wiered nightmare senario that made for some awseome scenes for the game.If you explore some of the Riddler chalenges, you get to know the story of a lot of diffrent Batman charecters, whitch is really cool.This game is really good, thumps up. 7 out of 10			"

												This game is awesome! I played it non stop until I had beat it!The boss fights are so much fun! I love how they have multiple aspects to them and are not just a ""hit with large things until they fall over"" sort of mechanic.The voice acting! Oh dear lord the voice acting! Could it get any better? The answer is NO. Its perfect. Hits all the notes and brings each villian to life. Especially Joker and Harley!Just LOVE this game to bits!			"

 You Don't Play Batman...You Are Batman  Batman: Arkham Asylum  is brilliant in almost every way. From a technical perspective: the game looks great, the animations work mostly well, the textures look great and the audio is brilliant (especially the voice acting). The game mechanics give the players the feeling that they are Batman instead of only playing a character who can be replaced by another. The player can easily take out multiple unarmed enemies, via the freeflow fighting system, but needs to be careful when they are armed (predator mode). These gameplay modes give the game more variety and are incredibly well made. The items are based on Batman's utility arsenal and can be used in a variety of different ways, next to their original purpose. The only thing that could have been better is the story, which is very comicish (even for a game that is based on a comic book), but leads to the better story in  Batman: Arkham City .

												My god! Just finished playing this game. I am amazed at how good this game feels in 2017. I tried playing Arkham city first but dint quite get hooked to it. I thought maybe a linear story driven game would be a better start and boy was i right! There are so many things this game gets right.... the Gothic setting, the amazing cut scenes, the audio files of interviews of the super villains which lets you piece their history bit by bit, sexy Ivy, and of course the combat and game play. I even enjoyed the boss battles which most people term a minus (though the last one with Joker seemed a little out of place and din't quite amuse me... I mean I cant never picture Joker as  the muscle driven type..) Overall a must buy and best start for those looking to explore the Arkham series as late as 2017.			"

Batman: Arkham Asylum is easily one of the best superhero games ever made.Pros: Graphics, Sound, ControlsCons: Gameplay, RealismBatman: Arkham Asylum is the first Batman game to truly glimpse into the adventures of the Dark Knight.  From the gritty, dark atmosphere to the nervous, superstitious ramblings of the inmates, every detail creates a sense of not just playing Batman, but being Batman.  Simple controls allow for excellent combat sequences or tight, stealthy getaways.Although some parts are truly innnovative, such as those with the Scarecrow, others are much more monotonous.  Finding all the Riddler trophies (not the actual, more interesting riddles) can sometimes feel like a glorified pixel hunt.  Some mechanics simply break the realism: Gotham should have spent more money on the concrete walls that are literally being pulled apart instead of the indestructible laser gates right next to them.Still, Batman: Arkham Asylum truly captures what it feels like to be the Dark Knight.9/10			"

If you have not played any of the batman games then start with this, appart from it being the first part of the batmman story, arkham city is bigger and better making this one seem like a lesser game, my advice is to enjoy the hell out of arkham asylum then get ready for even more in arkham city.

												One of the better adaptations of Gotham. The story plays excellently and the combination of stealth and fighting mechanics is fluid and intuitive. The voice acting by Joker and his dialogue in particular is brilliant. The soundtrack is mostly ambient, although the creepy diegetic music from Joker's radio station is effective. This game features a very effective use of the Unreal Engine 3, especially with the sharp textures and lighting effects. Be weary however that the PhysX effects are EXTREMELY taxing on a non-NVIDIA chip. Excellent game with a great story, good voice acting and a rich game world.8/10			"

												When I bought this game, I thought it would be funny to write a review of this game with just the words ""I'm batman"", but after playing, I realized that this game deserves a better review. So let me sum up a few pros and cons of this game.under these pros and cons I will explain them a little.+nice storyline+decent controlls+third person view+character bios+nice graphics+variation of opponenents+amazing joker+second batcave?+riddles+decent voiceacting+after-death-cutscenes-stable internet connection required-last bossfightHere the more in-depth explaination:The pros:The reason why I like the storyline is because you can see that the developers thought about it. the Joker pretty much creates some fun in the game while you're busy fighting his little ♥♥♥♥♥es.When I first saw the controlls, I thought they were somewhat odd, but after half an hour of playing I understood why they were made this way, and they actually feel really nice once used to it.I usually prefer to play games in first person view, but the third person view really fits this game. That way you can anticipate on attacks of henchmen and you will be able to counter them. It's also just nice to see the movements of Batman's cape.Another nice feature of this game is the character bios. The developers wrote a small background of pretty much every important character in the game. It also shows some facts of the characters, like when they first appeared and what their real names are (if known). But most of all I like the character bios because of the interview tapes you can collect in the game. They are quite funny and give you a little more information.Even though I played this game on a laptop with an intel pentium 4 processor and an on-board videocard, the game looked really great. Better than I expected.Another cool thing is that the Joker is not your only oppononent. You will also come across Harley Quinn, Scarecrow, The Croc, Poison Ivy, Bane, and Victor Zsasz. All of those have to be fought in another way, which brings some variation in the game. They also have different types of henchmen. The unarmed will have to be fought directly and with brute force, while the armed will have to be approached sneaky. There is also a difference between unarmed henchmen. Some will be really unarmed, while others use knives or kind of tasers. I also really love this Joker. They created him like a combination of Heath Ledger and the guy who played the Joker before him. Some may like it, some may not, but since this game is not in Gotham, Batman will not have it's batcave in this game. To give the feeling of a batcave, the developers made a secret second batcave on Arkham Island.To make it a little harder to complete this game, they created some riddles. Some are easy to solve, but since there are more than 200 riddles, you might take a while to actually solve all of them, mainly because most of them are actually not easy to solve.I'm a guy who loves to hear things and does a lot with his ears, so I hate it when there are crappy voiceactors in a game. Batman: Arkham Asylum actually uses decent actors, which makes it a lot more nice to play for people like me.In a lot of games you die, and you just resurrect, but in Batman: Arkham Asylum you die, and you get a little cutscene from an opponent, who's captured you and acts like he's about to kill you, which makes it less boring to die.Now the cons:When you play this game with an unstable connection, the game will suddenly stop once the connection is lost, and it will bring you back to the main menu. This caused me to start over a few times. It's really annoying when this happens mid-bossfight, because you will have to do everything from the bossfight once again. A serious problem which shouldn't be necessary since this is not an online game. The last bossfight against the Joker is pretty dull in my opinion. you pretty much have to do the same thing 3 times which is not really something the Joker would let you do.I overall rate this game 9.3/10			"

Fans of the Dark Knight will enjoy its many classic villans and other characters, as well as the voice cast from Batman: The Animated Series while many will love its third person free roaming world and the darker version of the Arkham universe will enjoy completing its 12 hour campaign. 9/10.

												First, if you haven't played BM:AA, then do it. You don't need this review.You're Batman. The good Batman, from the animated series, with the GOOD Joker...you know, from the animated series. Batman gets locked in Arkham's grounds and goes around beating up mentally unstable people with the most fluid and dynamic fighting controls ever put into a game. My only criticism is that Batman's ""detective"" mode is monochrome, and super useful, so that large portions of the game will be played with that viewpoint on. The game itself is so lovely and detailed that I hated using detective mode because I felt like it was taking me out of the game.I think if the developer's had used it as an augmented reality type view, it would have worked better.Oh, also, buy this if you love beefy beefcake weightlifters and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ schoolgirls.10/10, would be Batman again. And again.			"

												I loved playing this game, even with me and my potato computer i was able to run it with it looking amazing (except those eyes, creepy). The stealth segments felt amazing and was honestly my favourite part of the game, while the fighting felt extremely satisfying once i understood the patterns of the game.My one complaint would have to be the lack of variety in bosses, while poison ivy was my favourite boss for her unique fight, the rest were you fighting big hulking figures such as bane or some of joker's henchmen. Otherwise, amazing game.9/10			"

From that point I returned the game, and now, 6 years later, I'm purchasing it to finally complete it. Nostalgia.			"

												Great atmosphere, with the Joker giving constant commentary on what you're doing, he's always one step ahead of you so you're constantly playing catch-up. The arkham island consists of 5 buildings (medical, botanical, mansion, treatment, and penitentiary), as well as the sewer system. Most action take place in one of these buildings, so you usually don't have much open space. The rooms and corridors are beautifully detailed, thought.The combat system is simple to learn, but difficult to perfect. While the combat looks really cool, it lacks a bit of variety. The predator, aka stealth, sections of the game, where you take on multiple enemies armed with guns, are perhaps the most entertaining part of the game. Too bad there's few of them. They also become easy once you realize the power of the unconcious enemy + explosive gel/triple batarang combo. The enemies feel too unaware, even on hard mode. They are never a real threat unless you get recklessly aggressive. But still, it's good fun picking them off one by one and have them running around in total distress.I do wish the boss enemies were more interesting, they all just involve dodging attacks and throwing a batarang at the right moment.

												I'll never forget when this game originally came out. Initially, there wasn't a HUGE amount of fuss surrounding the build-up to it. Gaming publications and sites were quietly wary about it due to it being another licenced game, but then the game came out and we all know what happened then. I first played it right as it came out so weren't 100% sure what I was getting into. Within about 10 minutes, I knew there was something special going on here as the presentation was just fantastic. Following Joker as he gets wheeled into Arkham Asylum felt very different to what I was experiencing with a lot of action games recently, which had lost a lot of steam. About an hour into the game, I then realised this wasn't just your bog-standard action game. Suddenly I was dealing with puzzles, hidden collectables, a gripping story which really drew me in and the now popular free-roaming gameplay which the Arkham series became loved for. There's loads of Batman villains in the game, including such classics as Riddler, Killer Croc, Clayface, Poison Ivy, plus loads of references to further villains. The Riddler challenges are one of the best parts of the game. He'll have you hunting for wind-up teeth, hidden Riddler question marks, and the best part is hunting for actual riddles which reference Batman characters from over the years.The combat is simple enough in-game and you often find yourself taking on 5 - 10 goons at a time with ease due to the great range of moves on offer for the Bat. A combo system ensures you feel like a proper bad♥♥♥♥♥ and you#ll only ever die because you lose your flow and can#t get back into the rhythm of the battle. Basically, it'll have been your fault!Graphically, the game is still gorgeous even now after 8 years. The locations never feel empty with all the clutter and props on view, the characters all look very unique, and the whole thing comes across very sharp. I'm not one for getting into the intricacies of graphical properties, and polygons, shaders, AA, frame rates etc. I simply boil it down to it looks great and carries out the function it's intended to.Voice acting is carried out here with expert aplomb, with Mark Hamill especially standing out as always playing The Joker. With the exception of Harley Quinn, all characters sound fantastic and their voices truly fit the menace needed by them. Harley unfortunately is a squeaky annoyance who wouldn't go amiss in 'Singin' in the Rain'. Outside of the voice-work, the mood is set well with audio cues hitting at the right times and the ambience provided by a very fitting set of sound effects which always keep reminding you of where you are. Music is great, sounds like bintage Batman movie soundtracks. The game provides a long first time experience for the average gamer, and can easily get a good few extra hours on top if you want to 100% it. Enjoy this enough and you'll definitely want to go on and try out the sequels with Arkham City being the pinnacle, and Origins unfortunately feeling a little stripped back.OVERALL:[/b]Graphics: 10/10Gameplay: 9/10Lifespan: 9/10Audio: 9/10Overall: 9/10 "

												The gameplay was pretty good, it made me feel like I was Batman because I got to use the cool stuff he got to use. The story was also pretty OK too, as I didn't get bored  often. The game features a 'freeflowing' combat system. If you play it, you'll know what I mean. It's hard for me to explain, but basically, you can beat the crap out of one guy, counter another guy, and then do a flip and kick a guy in the stomach. That sorta thing.Storywise, you'll like it if you like Batman, or the Batman comic books. I am not really a fan of Batman, but I still kinda liked the story. You won't get 40+ hours with this game, I'll tell you that. I got 10 hours on Normal without looking for secrets, but I guess, if you look for ALL of the collectibles, it should take you and extra 2-3 hours.Graphics are pretty good, I guess.If you want to get it, make sure you get it with the bundle before it's too late!www.humblebundle.com "

												Played through on Hard first try, got about 80% of all of the collectables and secrets (there are hundreds). Very well made game, and rife with awesome Batman info/lore.The ONLY complaint I have with this game is the combat system. The combat isn't very complicated because there are many parts where you need to neutralize enemies in stealth, as any good Batman should. The problem here is that, because the combat is stretched so thin between straight up fighting and stealth, it does neither perfectly. STEALTH - Stealth is a very wishy-washy thing in this game, and because everything in a room is illuminated the same, you don't know if you are in hiding or if a gargoyle you've perched on is not actually putting you in the shadows. You can't fight enemies with guns straight up, so you are frequently forced into the stealth role.HAND-TO-HAND - Much of the straight up combat in this game is luck-based. Not all of it, but enough to be minorly frustrating in Hard mode. There is a 'counter' button while you're fighting that can counter an enemy's basic attack, but the prompt to counter shows up only 50% of the time, and even at that rate, it is very unlikely that you hitting the correct button will actually counter the enemy's attack because you're already in full swing of your own attack.And here inlies the main problem with this game - the 'difficulty'. Because of these certain flaws in the combat, the way the developers ramped up the difficulty was by not making certain enemies harder, but just simply putting more enemes in the combat with you. That isn't very good game design, in my opinion. Because not all attacks are properly counter-able, the more enemies you're fighting, the more you're at the whim of the randomness of the game and how the enemies approach you. I have often found myself having to replay some battles where I play noticeably worse, but win the overall battle becaue of the random way certain enemes approach or attack you.Yes, this is a fantastic game, but it's minor flaws turn into glaring ones during certain parts of the game. I would still highly reccomend it, but maybe not for a scaling challenge, but more for batman and adventure / collect-em-all fans.			"

												Batman: Arkham Asylum is the greatest comic book videogame of all time. This is an adult Dark Knight story that is well-told, packs some truly fun gameplay elements, has topnotch voice talent, and feels like it's part of Batman canon. If I have to nitpick, I wish the cutscenes looked better as they can distract from the tale and that the AI was a bit more responsive, but those are tiny flaws that shouldn't distract from the big picture.Rocksteady nailed what Batman is supposed to feel like.

The combat system, while basic can take a bit of time to actually master. The feeling of knocking out an enemy feels oh so good. Controls are tight and responsive( I use a Xbox One controller).

At first I wasn't a BIG fan of the Batman since I'm most a fan of Marvel, sure I know the basics of the storyline of Batman but after playing this game and it's sequels I give it a try to DC and I like it now too.But let's talk about the game:-Great story that makes you feel you are reading a big comic book novel about the Bat and what it gives it more epic is the fact that the game itself has Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill as Batman and Joker respectively.-Nice fighting system though sometimes can get a bit annoying.-Lot of classic Batman villians that each one has their own fights and weakness.-Many gadgets that can help out in any case, classic Batman.-Sometimes the game can be a little bit annoying while trying to solve the puzzles or the stealth scenes, but it's worth it to reach the end.-The animations and designs also look great.-The stealth scenes give you suspense and also is a nice way to deal with enemies using the dark or fear...just like the Batman would do.

												The must play for Batman fans. This game keep the dark atmosphere, comparable to Batman The Animated Series and picture Bruce Wayne as who he really is - a dramatic character. Map design are excellent, filled with little details and hidden secrets which are enriching the plot or telling additional story of some characters. Gunplay mechanics are amazing too, especially hand-to-hand combat which allow to create some crazy combos. The game require tactics, to takedown many enemies without anyone taking the notice which is very fun and Batman-like. To help that, player is presented with lots of iconic gadgets and tools. (I have finished the game using GFWL)			"

												First, if you haven't played BM:AA, then do it. You don't need this review.You're Batman. The good Batman, from the animated series, with the GOOD Joker...you know, from the animated series. Batman gets locked in Arkham's grounds and goes around beating up mentally unstable people with the most fluid and dynamic fighting controls ever put into a game. My only criticism is that Batman's ""detective"" mode is monochrome, and super useful, so that large portions of the game will be played with that viewpoint on. The game itself is so lovely and detailed that I hated using detective mode because I felt like it was taking me out of the game.I think if the developer's had used it as an augmented reality type view, it would have worked better.Oh, also, buy this if you love beefy beefcake weightlifters and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ schoolgirls.10/10, would be Batman again. And again.			"

Man, I remeber playing Batman on the SNES and whoo boy, that a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I mean, it was pretty damn bad. You didn't know what to do half the ♥♥♥♥ing time and the graphics looked liked somone was trying to make an homage to the earlier Mortal Kombat games(I thought they were better to be honest). So granted, my first experience with a batman game with 2-D fighting controls was a bummer. Lo and behold though, it would be years later when the DC franchise would pull itself up by the bootstraps and finally implement a fighting scheme that would not only complement the amount of enemies on screen, but also give inspiration to other games later as well. Not saying it's wholly original, nothing ever is, but it did refine it and give it nice shoe polish. Punching feels good and your attacks have impact. You actually FEEL like a super-duper detective in a skin tight suit(Schumacher fans will be disappointed), enacting your hero fantasies of yore. I never really thought stealth could be done in a batman game, but Rocksteady has proven me wrong. Takedowns from the highest perches to the lowlyest floor grate always feel smooth and satisfying. Snipers feel a bit cheap though, even when you're busy doing doing full nelsons to avoid enemy fire, or when you unexpectantly got shot from the back because you didn't see somone line up a perfectly placed shot in the guard tower adjacent to you. In short, it's a short game; took my only about 7-8 hours to beat, but well worth the experience. If you enjoyed Kevin Conroy in the 90's Batman animated show, bleed your fan-boy heart out.			"

												i love this game.the combat in this game isn`t that great and the predetor either but they were really a had of their time and the detective work was good too.this game has great story and great, it doesn`t has a big twist like the next game or a big shockung ending, but it has charm something about the story is just great.the charcters in this game are amazing, from batman to joker to scarcrow and even original charcters like warden quincy sharp or aaron cash or that guy who worked for joker all of the perfomnces are great, kevin conroy as batman who is the beat batman or mark hammel as joker who is the best joker (or hith ledjer because he is really good too) Arleen Sorkin as harley quinn who is (for a lot peapole not inclueding me) is the best harley quinn andi don`t remember the others but scarcrow, killer croc, the ridller, poison ivy, bane, aaron cash, james gordn, quincy sharp ans that guy with knifes victor zsasz and all of then had amazing performences.this game has great boss fights, in arkham city the boss fights are preedy much the same the villan throws some attacks at you you use one gadjet until you can finally punch him and he also throws his henchman at you accept from the mr freeze one but arkham asylom had a lot of difrennt tupes of boss fights, fron the titan ones (i perfer the titan thugs in this more than in the ones in arkham city) to the scarcrow ones, all of the boss fights were fun, there was titan and bane and there was acarcrow and killer croc and poison ivy and i liked the last fight with joker a lot more than most of the people and in every one of this was todally diffrent fron another.this game has two side missions the ridller one and the amadues arkham one, in  the ridller one you could collect thropies but the fun part was to answer ridlles becuse you get charcter bios and also you can break joker teeath and collect patint interviews ans in the end of the mission you found the risller place and send police ver there bit you didn`t saw how does the ridller looks wich was cind of lame. in the other side missiom you needed to fins and scan amadues arkham symbols and in the end you can discover who has the amadues arkham soul in him.that is preedy much it, i think this is probobly my lest favorite arkham game but this is stil really great.

												Update: Since the crappy DRM is gone, I can fully recommend this game now.Just play it before Arkham City, because the game is great but after AC, you don't really wanna play it again. Lovely initializer of the franchise, but combat mechanics are clunkier and little gliding time & gadgets compared to AC. Still, if it is the first Batman game you will enjoy it - even w/o being too much of a Batman fan.			"

												I was skeptical about this game when my friend first told me to get it. I'm not a fan of fighting games, and while I think Batman is both on of the best superheroes and one of the most interesting ones, I didn't really think a game like this--developed originally for the Xbox 360 and ported to PC--would do well. Boy was I wrong. Not only are the graphics surprisingly good, the audio (voice acting, fighting sounds, etc.) makes me feel like Batman. In particular, the voice acting is definitely some of the best I've heard in a video game. The fighting, though rather redundant, is still incredibly fun, though I did notice that countering enemy attacks was difficult. I may have been bad at it, but since I'm fine with it in the sequel to this game, Batman: Arkham CIty, I think it may have just been a minor issue in this game. The boss fights, while redundant, are quite fun and actually quite challenging. Furthermore, the story of this game is remarkably good. I never felt like I was playing through a fighting game with a story tacked on; it felt like a fighting game built around the story, in a good way. The atmosphere was top-notch and made me feel like Batman. To summarize:Pros-great atmosphere, solid gameplay, good graphics and audio, surprisngly good story, delivers an authentic Batman experienceCons-Issues with countering, boss fights can be redundant, hard to get used toOverall, I'd highly recommend this game.

												Finally got around to playing this, and I don't know what took me so long. This is brilliant. Batman as he always should have been. The game plays out like a 3D Metroidvania, rewarding exploration with tons of secrets to find, most of which you won't be able to get until Batman gets new abilities. The fighting system is fun and fairly intuitive, but the stealth mechanics are my favorite - the experience of being Batman has never come more alive than when I stalked my enemies from the shadows. The music never really spoke to me, but the art and presentation is excellent. The acting is exceptional on all sides, but Mark Hamill's Joker steals the show - as he should.BEST PART - Picking off a group of thugs one by one while they have no idea where I am, and the baddies left standing get more and more terrified.

												The first game in the Arkham Series, Arkham Asylum is nothing short of brilliant.  The plot revolves around Batman trapped in Arkham Asylum, run by the Joker. Along the way Batman fights to survive, and questions his sanity. He questions if he should be in the Asylum himself. Along the way he meets members of his great rouges gallery. The voice actors are brilliant. Kevin Conroy is great reprising his role as Batman from BTAS or Batman the Animated Series. In my mind, he is the one true Batman. Mark Hamill is hilariously dark as the Joker also reprising his BTAS role. You can see the fun these men are having playing their roles, and you can totally buy there long infamous history. The character designs are spectacular, the best being the Scarecrow.  As far as gameplay goes its top notch.  In the story there are some difficult parts, but I being a casual gamer, dont think  many gamers will have much trouble. I'd give the game a 10/10, but the thing that does not make it reach that is the sheer formulelic boss battles. I'm not a huge gamer, but when you add one small differnce to every boss battle, I was never suprised. the final boss battle is  the worst part of the game, in the sense that the game throws everything at you, which makes it seem really far from the brilliance of the first part of the game.An great expirence. 9 out of 10			"

												Do you like Batman?  Do you like beat em ups that aren't button mashers?  Do you enjoy great storytelling? This game checks all the boxes and more.  Only downsides are some dated cutscenes that look worse than in game and frame rate being capped at 60.  There was one segment where my framerate dropped to 10 fps, which was nauseating, but only lasted 10-20 seconds before I finished the objective and it returned to 60.  It was weird, but survivable.

												If you like Batman at all you need this game.  Pick it up when its on sale, you won't be disappointed.  The only complaint I have about this game is that I never really saw a reason to turn off the detective mode because I didn't want to miss any secrets.  I feel like this lead to me missing a lot of the artwork in the game or made me keep switching the mode on and off.  Other than that, amazing game!			"

												Being the first game of the Arkham series this game is an instant hook up. Most of Batman's main villains are here ready to take batarangs in the eye and not one of them is a b*tch about it. A solid story that'll leave you wondering how come Hollywood can't come up with movies like Arkham Asylum. A lot for the hardcore fan and even more for those who are not that into the Batman universe.			"

												Excellent Game! I definitely recommend it and give it an 8/10Pros: 1. Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill reprise their roles as the voices of Batman and Joker.2. The story isn't great but is engaging as it keeps introducing you to certain super villains. 3. The visuals are a treat.4. The element of stealth is well done. Even Batman is vulnerable to guns and that is quite clear in the game. 5. The gameplay mechanics are really well done. It's a whole lot of fun playing this game. 6. The play with respective super villains, especially Scarecrow, is really interesting. 7. Cutscenes! Cons: 1. The fight sequences, including the boss fights, can get a little repetitive2.

												Passed the game in the same breath, gloomy atmosphere, cool fights, exciting boss battles, steep ""chips"" - all this makes the game. But some negative things make the game not fun. The first - story. Throughout the game many times I got bored and I put the passage of a few days. Predictability enemies, actions that you perform all the time, as a cycle. Not a great variety of ""skills"" Batman. But the game has caused quite a lot of interest to the following parts, what will happen next? And so the game 7/10.			"

												After a many, really many reincarnation of Batman on game scene it finally looks, that we have a decent adaptation, which makes same honor to game industry as Nolan did for movies with his Dark Knight. However a game is based on comic book and not trying to hold Batman universe so much realistic as this director. A story comes from Paul Diny who earned five Emmy awards and already worked on the others Batman projects. Game takes you to Arkham Asylum (as title suggests) where offers a unique dark adventure. You'll feel like a real Dark Knight with all his modern technique, great moves and personal charisma. Joker has no chance even with all of his henchmen. 89/100			"

												This is still and perhaps always will be, at least in my opinion, the Batman game fans deserved. Set in a closed space, the Arkham Asylum, which is pretty significant to fans of the Batman universe, the game is also filled with references and characters from the series and the adventure feels like a high quality one-shot graphic novel.The atmosphere is palpable, the combat system is designed to flow smoothly with combos and the design also encourages the use of stealth and detective abilities.This game is closer to a Batman comic than any live action movie to date, with the great voice talent of Mark Hamill as the Joker, so if this doesn't feel like Batman, nothing ever will.(I would also recommend Arkham City to a somewhat lesser extent and to an even lesser extent but still worth your time, for the retro games fan in you, check out The Adventures of Batman & Robin on SNES and Genesis.)

 First of all, don't let my Steam playtime fool you, I've beat the retail version (that contained GFWL, yes I'm THAT tough) 100% along with all the achievments.  Batman Arkham Asylum Batman Arkham Asylum was the first and, in my own humble opinon, the best in the Arkham trilogy, and it still is, after 6 years, one of my favorite videogames.When it came out, it was something no one has ever expirienced from a Batman game before: it had simple, yet intuitive and extremely fun combat, amazing atmosphere, which unfortunately Arkham City couldn't replicate, and for the first time, a Batman videogame... made me feel like Batman.Rocksteady has done a terrific job with the Arkham games and I'm hoping Arkham Knight will be as good as Asylum, hopefully even better (actually, Knight on PC is quite poop...). If you have €20 to spare and you like action adventure games, I say go for it. If you're a Batman fan and you still don't have this game... HAVE YOU BEEN LIVING UNDER A ROCK FOR THE PAST 5 YEARS?!

												Batman: Arkham Asylum is a pioneer which changed the landscape of superhero genre in the gaming industry. Story is well written, as you will feel tension in the atmosphere. Joker pulls all the strings and you must fight the odds. It starts off with Joke being escorted to his asylum under Batman and Arkham Asylum's watchful eyes but Joker manages to escape and turns the asylum into his playground. You must save the people in the asylum and stop this madness that Joker had planned all along. The voice acting is top-notch. One can listen to Joker or the Riddler talk all day. The Scarecrow bit in the game is one of the best gaming moments ever. I loved the tone of many super-villians in an asylum with Batman. This game changed the whole landscape for the superhero games.You will feel like Batman as you will owerpower most of the thugs. Different gadgets are used to solve puzzles and move ahead in the story. The sleath mechanics are well done too and one of the best parts about stealth is how after you take out one of the enemies the fear slowly grips other enemies as they become aggressive but as soon as the numbers start dwindlling they start to panic, this machenic is one of the best in the gaming history. Boss fights on the other hand were a bit too easy and lackluster. Also there is some odd detective work which was nice. Of course, there is the good old fashioned brawling there too. Graphics and atmosphere are good as they capture the tone of the dark and gritty world. Art-style is also very good. Environmental design is brilliant and there a twisted sense of character in every area you’ll discover. This claustrophobic cove of madness oozing terror has to be one of the best settings in video-games.It has everything you would like from an immersive world, great storyline, sleath, detective work and old fashioned brawling. What else do you want? So, are you a Batman fan? buy this game, even if you are not one you will still love this game and is inarguably one of the best superhero games ever.			"

Greetings! As you probably know, Batman: Arkham Asylum is the first and the most critically acclaimed game of the newest Batman series in which you slip into the role of Batman himself fighting well known criminals and masterminds with fitting voice actors and design. Whilst playing the normal story mode you unlock certain challenges where you either fight criminals or need to master some stealthy tasks. Story Mode: The main part of the game takes place in - surprise surprise - Arkham Asylum. I cannot say too much about the story itself without spoilering anything, but except for a relatively weak and unsatisfying ending it can be -with its fantastic atmosphere- labeled as a quite classic one; well known in the Batman universe. You would probably be able to finish the story itself in a few hours but luckily there are 240 riddles placed all over the fully explorable map which are all in all relatively easy to solve once you get used to them with some exceptions. Solving riddles rewards you with some XP, new challenges, sometimes a biography entry in your database or an interview with well known characters of the Batman Universe. Combat System:Before I go into further details, I quickly want to explain the usage of experience points (which you naturally get when fighting enemies and solving riddles). There are around 20 updates for your Batman character categorised into improvements for you armour, your combat/stealth skills and additional techniques and items to use. It is worth noting that there are no skill trees you have to choose from, in the end you will most likely have every upgrade. The combat system itself is fairly simple. You usually deal with several enemies at once (even though only one attacks after the other whilst the rest waits) using a simple block and hit method at the beginning and then, as the game proceeds, more complicated combos and techniques will be 'unlocked' and learnt as more special enemies are entering the game. Even at the hardest difficulty the fights usually don't pose a big threat if you aren't aiming for perfection. However, the combat system being fairly easy does not change the satisfaction and the enjoyment that come with winning and participating in a fight due to the constant usage of nicely looking animations (especially for 2009) and the creation of a smooth flow during a fight.Challenge Mode:Once you have finished with the story mode and everything that it contains many turn to the Challenge Mode that has then been unlocked. It consists of several combat and stealth challenges with the latter one always containing 3 objectives that you have to fulfill. Acing every single one of them will surely take up some time and will probably lead to some frustration since trying to perfectly complete a combat task really shows all the possibilites that lie within this combat system which you usually don't necessarily need to master or explore in the story mode. So, overall if you are looking for a Batman game with a nice atmosphere, a decent story and an interesting background information on the Batman universe to explore, and a combat system that isn't too hard but still fun I'd recommend buying this game out of the whole series despite its age. If you aim to enjoy every aspect of the game I'd probably say that this game has an average playtime of 18 hours.Thank you for your attention, one person who has read this far.			"

												Still an absolutely fantastic game even nearly 9 years later. It's everything a Batman fan could want. Awesome combat, great stealth sections, a compelling story, fantastic voice acting and many easter eggs. All of those factors make this a near perfect game. While it may not be quite as good as Arkham City or Arkham Knight, I still highly reccomend playing this one, even if you're not a Batman fan. 9.5/10			"

 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA. . .BATMAN!      You guys know Mark Hamill does the voice for the Joker right? So that's pretty awesome. Anyways, this game is just plain fun. Does a great job of making you feel like your Batman.  The mechanics are fluid enough, though the gameplay does get repetative after a while, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Running around fighting familiar villains and their goons is pretty damn fun. Being limited to Arkham Island seems like it might feel a little stagnant at first, however, the map is a decent size and you keep pretty busy with the story. The graphics look pretty damn good, especially for a game that was released in 2009 and the graphics customization works great. Overall, I don't have any complaints for the game. 10/10			"

												Okay, so when was the last time you picked up a game nowadays and there wasn't shooter mechanics involved? Batman: Arkham Asylum just so happens to be proof that the action-adventure genre can still survive and do extraordinarily well in terms of profit amidst a plethora of other games that do the same old thing all over again. A lot of the gameplay reminds myself of older adventure games, and mixes it up with brawler action stuff which is good, but those with less than an average competence with button-press timing may find that the flow of combat is often interrupted and can at times be infuriating. The narrative is pretty much standard Batman with the twist that you face multiple of his most notorious villains, with Joker being a sort of pseudo-kingpin with a master plan. Add on the voice talent of Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill reprising  their roles as Batman and Joker respectively, and you definitely feel like this is an authentic Batman experience. All in all, if you haven't played Arkham Asylum by now, you really REALLY should, as it is (and was) a refreshing change of pace to the usual product. P.S. Kudos to whomever was in charge of putting those collectibles in the right places. Solving a puzzle to get the shiny thing is way more rewarding than just running around everywhere to find a feather perched at the top of a random building.			"

												Just got this today along with Arkham City. $5 bucks each!! Wow... Almost 7 years old and this game feels as great as it did the first time I played it back in the Peasant Station 3's golden days. It's a game that never bores you from beginning to end and it encourages you to find every unlockable.What to say about Arkham Asylum? This game revolutionized the way we play games. It brought so many innovations to a time when games were starting to feel so repetitive, uninspired, buggy and generic. The surprising thing was that this game was based on a DC superhero world; something that was considered a stigma in the gaming world. Almost no superhero game has ever been good, or interesting enough to engage people who are not into comics. Yet Batman Arkham series threw this misconception away and brought a magnificent piece of gaming software at the same time.So many games have tried to copy the Free-Flow system, but non have succeeded. This combat system is the 'pièce de résistance' of the Arkham series and will have you craving for fights. And I love how the game does so well at not overdoing it. It gives you just enough fights throughout the game so it is always exciting, without falling into repetitiveness. And still,  at the end, it rewards you with a mode were you can beat as many henchmen as you like.Appart fromt he wonderful combat system that it's such a treat to watch and perform, the game also engages you in stealth as well as playing the detective. It manages to wrap all this into an immersive story with a very dark style never seen before in a Batman game. It even manages to sneak some horror elements, which does fantasticaly well! Definitely a surprise for the first-timer.I really can't find any negatives on this game. It plays brilliant, looks wonderful for being a 7 year-old game, amazing soundtrack and sound effects. great voice acting (we've got the official Joker's voice: Mark Hamill), gorgeous and badass character designs, engaging story even for the non comic fan, and the list goes on.This game is a classic on its own right and it will go into history as one of the greatest and most influential games of the past gen.Graphics: 8/10 It's a 7 year old game but it still looks fenomenal. The PC version benefits from sharper textures, light effects and 60fps. It almost does not look as old as it really is.Sound: 7/10 The soundtrack alone is epic! But it suffers from volume spikes. Cutscenes are too loud. Something that many games suffer from.Controls: 9/10 You got to play this with a controller. Once you do, you find yourself with one of the most responsive, smooth and intuitive controllers there is. Developers really put an effort in them.Gameplay: 9/10 This game is in a league of its own. Back when it came out, there was nothing like it. Brilliant fighting mechanics! Great ballance between stealth, beat'em up, exploration and even horror, making this game feel interesting from beginning to end.Story: 8/10 Simple, but engaging. That darker, more mature Batman game no one really asked for, but oh boy, thank the gods we got!			"

												Let’s just start with the obvious: one does not have to be a comic fan to enjoy this game. And in that extremely impossible case that you somehow missed all the movies (even Nolan’s ones) here’s a quick recap. Bruce Wayne whose parents were tragically murdered is insanely rich, dresses in a suit that resembles a bat and beats the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of all kinds of bad guys while using cool gadgets. In a devilishly insane logic of superhero comic villains caught by our hero all end up in a special kind of jail which happens to be also a madhouse. It’s Arkham Asylum. Obviously, it turns out badly; asylum is overrun by criminals, and it’s up to Batman to stop them. That’s it without spoiling too many details. After all the game is set in a separate universe which tends to follow the usual canon, but also steps out of the bounds here and there. And this is a big deal for those, who can distinguish Earth-2 from say Earth-15.The plot revolving around events of one night and set in one place results in a rather tense game. First in the series Arkham Asylum may lack the extent, size and polish of its successors, but it has that unique feeling of being trapped inside an insane maze. These corridors, buildings, underground and open air sections are so tightly stitched together, that there’s practically no room to make a breathe, unless developers intended to let you. This is non-stop rollercoaster ride accelerating to the limit and beyond it, until you finally fall in the abyss of total madness, lose all sense of time and spend sleepless night with the game. Rocksteady Studios not just break the fourth wall with this game, they destroy it with a power of nuclear explosion. Carefully crafted props, marvelously fluid animations, diverse gameplay varying from famous “flowing” combat to stealth, puzzle solving, detective mode and beyond that. And ultimately the story. I won’t spoil you the exact scenes happening in the middle of the game, but they are simply outstanding in their ability to convey a feeling of lunacy overcoming Batman in this nuthouse.Gotham Knight’s labyrinth path expectedly twists and bends in way that returns the player to previously visited areas with a new set of toys. That differs in tone and simplicity from most of the hard-core metroidvanias. Rather than just giving tools to overcome some obstacles game gently pushes you in the right way making sure you won’t struggle with trying to figure out what to do next. It’s not a game about exploring, though there are some clever hidden optional areas containing secrets and unobvious puzzles; but that’s for those who just can’t get enough of Arkham Asylum. When it comes to the main progression route the game won’t let off your hand. And while in general that would be a major flaw in my eyes, this time it isn’t. One can say that it’s just a matter of perspective, matter of taste; that you can’t just drop off the player in the middle of nowhere nowadays and hope, that’s he’s clever and curious enough to figure his way from the starting point towards the ending. That may be true… it actually is true, I must say, but that’s beside the point. That’s the matter of taste. Back again to perception of it. Here we have that idea of lunatic luna-park, the goal of filling player with madness. And you can’t just stop and let player wander without breaking that feeling and pace. You ever had that weird nightmare where you run in circles seeing same place again and again not being able to comprehend how many times you did it, not being able to break the cycle? Even if you haven’t, I think you can get it. And that pardons Rocksteady Studios.This was a breakthrough for the video games back in 2009, and it still is a stellar interactive experience whether you care about Batman comics or not. And the actual secret for this success turns out to be rather simple. It doesn’t matter if player is a fan of Bruce Wayne, it matters that developer is. It’s that special attention to the tiniest of details like animation of the main character’s coat or getting original voice-artists from Batman: The Animated Series (including genius Mark Hamill, playing Joker). And this passion just won’t leave anyone indifferent. At least when it’s accompanied with such brilliant execution of gameplay mechanics. Let’s just say that a fair number of games released since then simply copied Arkham Asylum freeflow combat system. And none of them came even close.			"

												Well it´s been a while since we enjoyed a good Batman game  OST HARDLY RELATED  but this game is quite interesting...Rocksteady Studios brought us this game in 2009, thats 3 years after Urban Chaos their first game (which was quite good IMO) so i´ve been waiting the Goty Edition of this game for a while and it´s time to talk.It uses the Unreal Engine 3, built by the awarded Studio Epic Games, and it uses very well the LCPP (Lightning Calculations Per Pixel) and the HDRR (High Dynamic Range Renderer) allows you to behold all the scenery created for the game.The plot is awesome, a twisted Joker instigate an elaborate plan to gain the control of Arkham Asylum, trapping Batman inside with all the maniacs and foes that he has been imprisioning all these years. As you see it´s simple but full of shades among the different corridors of the Asylum. During the game you´ll find some of the most famous villains, and every boss fight hides messages as references for their comic-story.As for the gameplay. Actually its fun, it has some fails of course but you can still enjoy the combat. You can counter, attack or stun your enemy with the Freeflow combat, this system also allows Batman to move fast between your targets, chaining different combos with your gadgets in order to get over with.If you don´t want to fight all day you can use predatory tactics. The predator combat is based on the stealth, silent knockbacks, takedowns, drops or even using your gadgets (like explosives) to destroy walls or roofs in order to tilt the odds in your favor.After this you´ll be rewarded with XP, which are used to:-Improve your physicall armor.-Unlock combat moves & Gadgets.-Get Health upgrades.What about the enemies? Well, they react to your own acts as Batman. If they find inconcious allies their ""fear"" will raise, altering their behavior. And this means that they´ll change their patterns. They can shoot on sight, disable your predator points (gargoyles for instance), move to another part of the scenario, stay together with their allies forcing you to change your tactics.The design is hilarious and was complete in 2 years, one of the developers spent these years just designing Batmans Cape, just for make it move realistically. It´s not about the cape, it´s about the work, effort and love that this developers made to make this game shine. Even the writing, they though that more characters (like Freeze) will not fit into this game, due to discrepancies with Joker and because he doesnt have personal grudges against Batman. They though this with nearly every antagonist and they only use the ones who makes sense with their plot.Talking about characters...the developers WANTED the voices of the Animated Series made by Paul Dini. In fact Dini was helping with the writing of it. So they took Mark Hamill as Joker and Arleen Sorkin as Harley Quinn respectively...and Kevin Conroy for Batman. Nothing more to say guys 10/10 in dubbing.Finally, the game also has a lot of content even when you finish it. A lot of riddles, Joker Teeth, Riddler Trophies, Chronicles of Arkham, Patient Interviews (audios talking about the different stories of the villains) and combat Challenges.Must Buy Guys.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bueno, ha pasado un tiempo desde que disfrutásemos de un buen Batman OST HARDLY RELATED pero este juego es algo interesante...Rocksteady Studios nos trajo este juego en 2009, es decir 3 años después de su primer juego Urban Chaos (decentillo IMO), así que estuve esperando un tiempo hasta pillar el formato GOTY y es hora de hablar.Su motor gráfico es el Unreal Engine 3, usado por el aclamado estudio Epic Games, y usa muy bien sus características como el LCPP (Lightning Calculations Per Pixel) y el HDRR (High Dynamic Range Renderer) permitiendote contemplar toda la escenografía y efectos creados para el juego.La trama es increíble, un Joker retorcido que instiga un elaborado plan para hacerse con el control del sanatorio mental de Arkham, atrapando a Batman dentro con los maníacos y todos los enemigos que ha ido encerrando estos años. Sinceramente es una trama simple, pero creada para que de juego con todos los matices que quieren ofrecerte en el juego. A lo largo del juego encontrarás a algunos de los villanos más famosos de Batman, y todos esconden historias más allá de sus peleas referentes al cómic.Hablando del modo de juego. Es muy divertido, aunque con fallos de respuesta en contadas ocasiones que ciertamente no te evitarán disfrutar del juego. Puedes contraatacar, atacar o usar stuns en un modo desarrollado por Rocksteady llamado Freeflow combat. Este sistema permite moverte a gran velocidad entre los enemigos, encadenando diferentes combos con tus artilugios para superar los encuentros.Si no quieres estar luchando todo el día, te entiendo, puedes usar otra variante del combate conocida como depredador. El modo depredador se basa en el sigilo, ataques sigilosos y derribos sin alertar a los enemigos, usar puntos altos para agarrar a tus enemigos o usar los utensilios para destruir paredes, techos, etc... para inclinar la balanza a tu favor.Después del combate, serás recompensado con puntos de experiencia, que son usados para:-Mejorar tu armadura física.-Desbloquear movimientos y utensilios.-Desbloquear mejoras de salud.Acerca de los enemigos. Reaccionan a los actos de Batman. Si encuentran a un compañero inconsciente o son alertados por un superior su nivel de ""miedo"" aumentará haciendo que adopten diferentes patrones y alterando su comportamiento. Podrán disparar a discreción, destruir puntos altos (como gárgolas), moverse en grupos, explorar el escenario, etc...El diseño tampoco se queda atrás, fue completado en tan solo 2 años. Para que entendáis el empeño del estudio. Uno de los programadores pasó estos 21 meses de desarrollo programando solo la capa, porque necesitaban un movimiento realista y que quedase resaltado por el UE3. Incluso el guión fue cuidado hasta el punto de no incluir más villanos de los necesarios, porque muchos de ellos desentonarían en el ámbito que se desarrolla en Arkham Asylum o por discrepancias con Joker(como Freeze). Y hablando de personajes, los desarrolladores QUISIERON las voces de la serie animada de Batman, si aquella de los 90 que tanto molaba, que hizo Paul Dini. De hecho el mismo Dini acabó ayudando en más de un aspecto del desarrollo. Así que debido a esto tomaron a Mark Hamill y Arleen Sorkin como Joker y Harley Quinn respectivamente y a Kevin Conroy como Batman. Un 10/10 en doblaje.Para finalizar, el juego tiene además una gran cantidad de contenido cuando lo superas. Acertijos, trofeos, mandíbulas de joker, diarios de audio para aprender más de los personajes, etc...Este juego es uno de los que deben jugarse.			"

												I was exited for this game since i first saw it on Youtube but when i played the game itself i saw somethings that accully weren't in Youtube but still as i said the game is amazing and even tho there will still be some people here asking: ''Why have you only played for 3.4 hours?''. You can only think of the answer... There was a level aka. story stage which i couldn't finish but that is something you don't need to know here. But the game itself is really good the subtitles accully followed the game (we all know there are some games in which subtitles don't follow) and the graphics are okay (for some bad as i said my opinion). So the next Batman game that is Batman:Arkham Knight is suppose to be amazing and ofcourse as a huge Batman lover i agree with all the people who think that the game will be amazing. But again i went away from the accual point. So i hope ya'll enjoy the accual review and have a nice day (or whatever part of the day you're reading this review).			"

												Batman: Arkham Asylum is a 2009 action-adventure video game based on the DC Comics superhero Batman. It was developed by Rocksteady Studios and published by Eidos Interactive in conjunction with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 video game consoles, and Microsoft Windows. It was released worldwide for consoles, beginning in North America on August 25, 2009, with a Microsoft Windows version following on September 15.Written by veteran Batman writer Paul Dini, Arkham Asylum is based on the long-running comic book mythos. In the game's main storyline, Batman's archenemy, the Joker, instigates an elaborate plot to seize control of Arkham Asylum and trap Batman inside with many of his incarcerated foes. With Joker threatening to detonate hidden bombs around fictional Gotham City, Batman is forced to fight his way through the asylum's inmates and put an end to the Joker's plans. Most of the game's leading characters are voiced by actors who have appeared in other media based on the DC Animated Universe; Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, and Arleen Sorkin reprised their roles as Batman, the Joker, and his sidekick Harley Quinn respectively. The game is presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on Batman's combat and stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets that can be used in combat and exploration.The game received critical acclaim—particularly for its narrative—and won several awards, including Best Action Adventure game, Best Game, and Game of the Year from different media outlets. It held the Guinness World Record for ""Most Critically Acclaimed Superhero Game Ever"". A Game of the Year edition was released on March 26, 2010, and an OS X version was released in November 2011. Arkham Asylum '​s success launched a series of Batman: Arkham sequels, beginning in October 2011 with Batman: Arkham City.			"

												A deranged man-child billionaire dresses up as a rodent and beats the mentally challenged until they stop moving- the ultimate BatMan experience!! lol :)Arkham Asylum is the first arkham game, which came out in 2009. It's a simple 3rd-person action game that introduced the best combat system for a video game that had both rhythm, fluidity, and challenge. It also introduced a stealth mechanic that made you truly feel like batman, while keeping with balance so you aren't too overpowered. The game features awesome voice work by Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, and Arleen Sorkin and a great story as well.Pros:-Fun campaign to play through-challenges are more fun than the regular story mode -Hollywood voice talent featuring Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, and Arleen Sorkin-ground-breaking combat and stealth-Fun detective work-after beating the game, you can expect to only have about 58% of available achievements  -there are 240 riddles and I've only done around 25-30%Cons:-mediocre boss fights -this game is like 30% of the size Arkham City is. -This game is hell for completions with all the 240 riddles			"

												At the start of the game I couldn't help but dislike the character of Batman himself, being a tank of meaty flesh but with the grace of a ballerina. However, the longer you play, the less you notice those chiseled butt-cheeks, and the more you appreciate the game itself.The environments are beautiful and suprisingly diverse, especially for being in one asylum and do not lack in detail. Along the way, you can find many hidden dossiers and tapes of villains from the DC universe and of course those famed riddler trophies. I remember staying up all night trying to get all of those darn things. ;)Of course a major seller of the franchise is the combat, which seems to have formed a new kind of standard. At the beginning it can feel repetitive and a bit like button mashing, but ultimately the way Batman fights does depend entirely on the player. You can unlock new abilities to mess with the npcs even more.Overall I recommend this as a solid game, which will engage the player for a good deal of hours.			"

												First off, I'm not a Batman fan (only watched the... 1990? flick with Kim Basinger and Michael Keaton) and I'm not a superhero fan either but this game has almost turned me into both!I know I'm late to the party in 2016 but this game is absolutely amazing with stunning visuals and an extremely detailed world to explore. For a Batman fan, this must be the pinnacle of awesomeness. For me as a regular gamer it's just plain awesome.My only gripe would be the consolitis which shines through at times. I also wasn't too impressed with the rather lame bossfights which are made unnecessarily annoying because of said consolitis and camera issues. In fact, I have not beaten the final boss yet due to these issues but I have kept the game installed and shall try again.Verdict: A highly recommended near masterpiece. Now onward to Arkham City...

												This game is very good. It starts off where Arkham Origin left off with Batman driving the Joker to Arkham Asylum where the Joker escapes and takes over the Asylum and frees the inmates.The gameplay is quite fun and enjoyable. The combat is your basic ""spam X/Left Click until you have to press Y/RMB to counter"" for the most part, but it does eventually introduce enemies that have certain weaknesses you can exploit or certain strengths you have to avoid, for example, you mightn't be able to attack certain enemies from the front. The base stealth mechanics are good, but the advanced mechanics are quite interesting. For example, one of the missions has you rescuing Asylum staff, but if you are detected the staff die. But, if you take out any of the inmates, the suicide collars they are wearing go off, which also causes the staff to die. The game runs very well for the most part, but whenever it loads and render in new sections in an area it has noticeable frame drops. This could possibly be fixed by installing onto an SSD, but I think the problem lies within the rendering method employed by the engine. My 1060/6600K rig can hold a locked 60FPS or a locked 144FPS for the entire duration excluding the aforementioned framedrops, though, even at 2560x1440.  See here for how to change your max framerate and other video options that aren't in the options menu [pcgamingwiki.com] . Scroll down even further to find out how to install the ex-PS3 exclusive DLC among other fixes. The levels load quite quickly, even on a 7200RPM HDD. The game has controller support for the XBox 360 controller and autodetects it when it is plugged in. I used DS4Windows to use my PS4 controller for my playthrough of it, though I used mouse and keyboard for a while and found the default binds good and the fact you could rebind each key even better.There are a few puzzles you have to solve, but nothing too major or difficult. You just keep looking from different angles and eventually there'll be a path or solution staring you in the face.The characters are a little dull and boring and don't have any real depth to them, except maybe the Joker. You can  feel  the crazy.Overall, I can highly recommend this game as a must play for anyone who likes the Batman universe or anyone who likes 3rd person combat/stealth games.			"

													Arkham Asylum is a solid game with a rich, atmospheric world. The visuals are good, the gameplay is decent, the environments are packed with detail, and the story is interesting.	The characters are portrayed very well. Even though I tend to have a serious, do-good demeanor (does that remind anyone of a particular Dark Knight?), the Joker's off-the-wall humor cracked me up on several occasions. Every main character's performance is on point, but Mark Hamill's Joker is absolutely superb.	Stability-wise, Arkham Asylum seems very well-tested and bugfixed. I've yet to encounter problems more serious than some clipping and physics weirdness, and my perusals around the internet revealed nothing diabolically game-breaking. It seems to be a wonderfully solid game in terms of technical stability, which is infuriatingly uncommon in games these days.ISSUES	Some of these ""issues"" are subjective, since I had to dig deep to find anything particularly bad about this game. It goes without saying, but that is a very good thing.	The facial animations look slightly robotic. They're not the worst I've seen by any means, but sometimes they're a little too stiff and mechanical.	Arkham Asylum is one of those games with no ""after the final boss"" scenario. You have to restart at the last checkpoint before the final story sequence, and you can never actually reach a permanent ""finished"" state. This is a game with many secrets and collectibles; if you want to find them all and haven't by the end of the game, you have to ignore the final boss and leave the game in a state of limbo while you try to get the rest of the collectibles.	That said, when you've beaten the game once, the final boss is no longer a primary objective when you reload the save. As a result, while you can never reach a finished ""after-the-end"" gameplay state, at least it indirectly acknowledges that the game has been finished before.	There are hidden scenes/objects that you have to visually scan to prove you've found them, as part of a secrets/collectibles sidequest. Some of these scenes require a ridiculous amount of zoom and a pixel-perfect perspective to actually register. Unless the camera is in the perfect position, the game will complain about bad alignment or zoom, even though it's obvious that you've figured out the puzzle. Fortunately, this isn't a huge problem; only a minor occasional annoyance.	Arkham Asylum has a slight case of consolitis. Most of the options can only be changed with a launcher, buttons have multi-layered functions that can easily compromise your control (I'm looking at you, Jump/Run/Activate/Dodge button), the UI is a little messy and oversized, and there are a few other symptoms. However, given its third-person viewpoint and relatively small focus on intuitive camera movement, I actually recommend Arkham Asylum to be played with a controller. It can't beat the intuition of mouse control in some situations, but a controller works very well most of the time.SUMMARY	Overall, Arkham Asylum is a very nicely made game. I give it an 8/10.	Strengths: Stability, gameplay, environments, graphics, sound	Weaknesses: Replay value (almost everything is scripted), consolitis			"

												Batman Arkham Asylum is no doubt one of the best comic book game adaptations of all time. The game’s style and presentation is completely off the chain, the scene where you enter Arkham Asylum left me stunned for several minutes, and the environment is just flat out amazing. However, Arkham Asylum did not get GOTY due to just its graphics. Its combat system is expansive thanks to the upgrade system and its combat mode keeps the game fresh; some mission requires you to stealthily take out enemies while others drops you in the middle of the action. There are tons of contents and challenges to be had, do yourself a favor and buy this game.			"

I dont get how the Bad guys are not looking up even in the Cartoon series (as i am affiliated with never read the comics).Simply loving it and cant wait to finish the game and try again to get all the Riddlers trophies.

												A deranged man-child billionaire dresses up as a rodent and beats the mentally challenged until they stop moving- the ultimate BatMan experience!! lol :)Arkham Asylum is the first arkham game, which came out in 2009. It's a simple 3rd-person action game that introduced the best combat system for a video game that had both rhythm, fluidity, and challenge. It also introduced a stealth mechanic that made you truly feel like batman, while keeping with balance so you aren't too overpowered. The game features awesome voice work by Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, and Arleen Sorkin and a great story as well.Pros:-Fun campaign to play through-challenges are more fun than the regular story mode -Hollywood voice talent featuring Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, and Arleen Sorkin-ground-breaking combat and stealth-Fun detective work-after beating the game, you can expect to only have about 58% of available achievements  -there are 240 riddles and I've only done around 25-30%Cons:-mediocre boss fights -this game is like 30% of the size Arkham City is. -This game is hell for completions with all the 240 riddles			"

												At the start of the game I couldn't help but dislike the character of Batman himself, being a tank of meaty flesh but with the grace of a ballerina. However, the longer you play, the less you notice those chiseled butt-cheeks, and the more you appreciate the game itself.The environments are beautiful and suprisingly diverse, especially for being in one asylum and do not lack in detail. Along the way, you can find many hidden dossiers and tapes of villains from the DC universe and of course those famed riddler trophies. I remember staying up all night trying to get all of those darn things. ;)Of course a major seller of the franchise is the combat, which seems to have formed a new kind of standard. At the beginning it can feel repetitive and a bit like button mashing, but ultimately the way Batman fights does depend entirely on the player. You can unlock new abilities to mess with the npcs even more.Overall I recommend this as a solid game, which will engage the player for a good deal of hours.			"

												Once you understand the fighting mechanics, it's addictive. I had this on ps3 and bought it also for pc. I played the main story 3 times. There is still a bug with PhysX at the dream scene (switch physx of and aftewards turn it on again), but for a cheap price i highly recommend it.			"

Product received for free
												I got this game mainly because well, IT'S BATMAN! (No more need to be said there)If you like stealth games and action adventure games you will find this game quite enjoyable.I haven't completed this game or started any other game in the arkham series, but as far as I've gotten I've enjoyed it. I really like the stealth missions, once you take one person out the rest just start squealing and I fricken love it. I also like when you die the person who killed (or the man behind your death) comes and mocks you... Yes, I enjoyed that part.My favourite parts of the story is when Scarecrow gives you drugs and you start tripping. Just the whole platforming minigame on a nightmare where scarecrow torments you just brings me happieness (Don't judge me)My one main complaint is the personality and character being batman himself, he's a wimp! Not in the way that he's scared of anything, no no, he's a complete bad@$$, just he doesn't actaully kill anyone. Now I'm not some 6 year old kid complaining about how it's ""Not Violent Enough"" no way, in fact to see a game with alot of time and effort put into to it that isn't a VIOLENT MURDER SIMULATOR WHERE THE WATER IS MADE OF BLOOD AND EVERYTHING YOU SEE SHALL DIE!!! kinda game is nice every once in a while, but back to my batman point, he doesn't kill anyone, just knocks them unconscious, and again, I'M NOT COMPLAINING THAT IT'S NOT VIOLENT ENOUGH, but the fact that everyone he knocks unconscious would kill batman with little to no regret is either really nice on batman's part or really stupid. Now for the actaul human beings, FINE, they were human and batman is all about the murder-lifestyle. But when those mindless monster enimies that would tear batman limb for limb carelessly, come charging at batman and he only knocks them unconscious, that's dumb, that's really dumb.But all and all, even though the motives of batman's ways with enimies isn't very smart, it's a great game, and remember, this is coming from someone who hasn't finished the game or played any other arkham game.8.75/10, would recommened			"

												This game is very good. It starts off where Arkham Origin left off with Batman driving the Joker to Arkham Asylum where the Joker escapes and takes over the Asylum and frees the inmates.The gameplay is quite fun and enjoyable. The combat is your basic ""spam X/Left Click until you have to press Y/RMB to counter"" for the most part, but it does eventually introduce enemies that have certain weaknesses you can exploit or certain strengths you have to avoid, for example, you mightn't be able to attack certain enemies from the front. The base stealth mechanics are good, but the advanced mechanics are quite interesting. For example, one of the missions has you rescuing Asylum staff, but if you are detected the staff die. But, if you take out any of the inmates, the suicide collars they are wearing go off, which also causes the staff to die. The game runs very well for the most part, but whenever it loads and render in new sections in an area it has noticeable frame drops. This could possibly be fixed by installing onto an SSD, but I think the problem lies within the rendering method employed by the engine. My 1060/6600K rig can hold a locked 60FPS or a locked 144FPS for the entire duration excluding the aforementioned framedrops, though, even at 2560x1440.  See here for how to change your max framerate and other video options that aren't in the options menu [pcgamingwiki.com] . Scroll down even further to find out how to install the ex-PS3 exclusive DLC among other fixes. The levels load quite quickly, even on a 7200RPM HDD. The game has controller support for the XBox 360 controller and autodetects it when it is plugged in. I used DS4Windows to use my PS4 controller for my playthrough of it, though I used mouse and keyboard for a while and found the default binds good and the fact you could rebind each key even better.There are a few puzzles you have to solve, but nothing too major or difficult. You just keep looking from different angles and eventually there'll be a path or solution staring you in the face.The characters are a little dull and boring and don't have any real depth to them, except maybe the Joker. You can  feel  the crazy.Overall, I can highly recommend this game as a must play for anyone who likes the Batman universe or anyone who likes 3rd person combat/stealth games.			"

												By itself this game is wonderful. If you've played Arkham City though, there is no going back. Arkham City improves on every aspect of Arkham Asylum. Especially the fighting. The range of the beat-em-up combat which once felt flawless in Arkham Asylum now feels constrained after exploring all the combat options Arkham City brought forth.So if you haven't played any of the Batman: Arkham games, start with this one because once you've played Arkham City, you can't go back. By itself, it's one hell of a game with a hell of a story and one of the most enveloping first five minutes of a video game.			"

												Arkham Asylum, at the time of this review, is a bit aged (released in 2010, this is 2016), yet still manages to hold it's own admist the newer generation of gameplay and graphics.Already being a fan of Batman and DC since a child, I was extremely excited to try out the first real Batman game, and I was pleasantly surprised with a game that actually is better than many other games, even given it's semi-un-original content and linear storyline based on plot information that most people, even non-DC/Batman fans already know.The game takes place in Arkham Asylum, an island in the city of Gotham, Bruce Wayne/Batman's domain.  The island goes under quarantine after Joker escapes his captivity and leads the various villains and criminals to control the island.As previously stated, the story-line, is semi-unique.  It hasn't been told exactly before (afaik), but it's fairly predictable if you're familiar with the universe.  Even so, the story is rich, characters have backstory and development and well-done voice acting and dialog in general.The combat system is the classic Assassin's Creed II combat system.  Lots of hand to hand and ""press Y to counter"" combat, with lots of gadgets, specials, combos, score multipliers and other abilities.  The combat is very fluid and fun, but may get a bit repetitive for some after a while.The game world is semi-open.  You have free reign over the island and it's buildings to do the missions, or go explore for collectibles (a lot of these by the way).  This is of course permitting you've reached the story points that allow access to the locations in question.The collectibles, while there are an abundance, are all useful.  Collectibles unlock backstore to the creator of the Asylum and it's history, cell-tapes from various villains, backstory on villains or important characters, concept art and challenge maps.The graphics, for a 2010 game in 2016, are still pretty damn good, so nothing to worry about here.Keyboard and mouse controls are a bit clunky/confusing and don't work to well, due to the console -> PC porting of the game, unfortunately, but with a controller, the gameplay is stellar, and goes without a hitch.Definitely worth picking up, although at $20 for a 6 year old game, personally, I'd wait for a sale, even though the game is very good and still likely worth $20 for most.

												After finally finishing the story mode and most of the DLCs (above all, Scarecrow Nightmare), I have enough experience and knowledge of the game to make a bold review.The game, from start to end, tells you it's going to be about mysteries that need to be solved, places that need to be scouted, and enemies that need to be put down. And of course, there isn't only the Joker, you will have to battle a handful of other much more powerful (but not as intelligent) villains.At first I read the description; ""explore every inch of Arkham Island"", and I thought to myself ""I am limited only to Arkham? Well that can't be big enough, this game is going to be short!”, On the contrary, the island is extraordinarily well designed, and quite extensive. A speedrunner can finish the game within 2 hours, but anybody that has ever played an Elder Scrolls game will squeeze the gameplay hours off this game. With most of the DLCs and all the story, I invested over 10 hours in this game.The combat system is simple, yet it never gets boring. The AI is beautiful, enemies actually feel smart, and combat can be tricky. But the best part is the Assassin’s Creed-like stealth part of the game; if you want to, you can take out enemies without even engage them in combat, one by one. The remaining enemies will react accordingly; they will get nervous, scared, terrified, and more aware of your current situation.I can go on for pages explaining how well designed, well written and beautifully set this game is. But that experience can only be truly known by playing the game. It’s a no-brainer; you get it whenever it’s on sale. Don’t be fooled by the old styled menus and by how obviously this game has aged, it is still one of the best third-person, action/thriller games. And of course, as serious and concrete I want this review to be, we can’t oversee the obvious appeal this game has; it’s Batman. "

												Imagine that you extract all of the best elements from Tim Burton's Batman movies, Joel Shumacher's Batman & Robin and Nolan's Dark Knight trylogy and you mix it with everything the best what Batman comic books have to offer, adding to it - at the end - the most excellent essence from that awesome Batman cartoon which aired in early 90ties. Then you stir it all together within the pot called 'video game'. Batman: Arkham Asylum would be your outcome. Game is just perfect (or 'games' as it applies to the every part of this awesome quatrology).Ah, and i was joking about Shumacher's Batman & Robin - that movie was disgraceful piece of♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Batman Arkham Asylum: Game of the Year EditionPositives:+ The game has an interesting selection of gadgets to use. There's the batclaw, which is used to pull vent grates off walls, explosive gel to destroy structurally weak areas and the cryptographic sequencer, which allows Batman to overload security terminals and gain access to restricted areas. There's also batarangs and the line launcher, which is a portable device that fires a zip line for Batman.+ The characters are good, they all have personality except for Batman himself, who seems to be very straightforward and lacking in emotion. Joker is a particular standout and the audio tapes found around the Aslyum shed light on various inmates who are Batman's foes.+ Decent graphics.+Game length is anywhere between 20-30 hours or so, depending on how many riddles you solve and your desire to play beat em' up challenge mode.Mixed:~ The combat can be fun, but also borderline infuriating at times. Using unlockable Waynetech upgrades, Batman can perform takedown moves, throw enemies and do more critical damage. However, the combat is very unresponsive with regards to countering and in this respect Sleeping Dogs did a far better third person combat system. The fact Batman: Arkham Asylum doesn't detect your counter effectively really lets it down.~ The Riddler's hidden mini puzzles and items add a nice distraction and diversion to the main story, but at the same time they can be a bit boring if you want to complete them all, even if you discover a Riddler secrets map. It was a nice idea and it does add an element of exploration to the game, but 240 Riddler challenges is a bit excessive. My main gripe is that Batman's detective mode is required to find a lot of these trophies and it's quite annoying to be running around all over the map in black and white vision.~ The story is not bad, it's just not fantastic either. It's a bit difficult to follow, despite its simplicity. I know that sounds like a contradiction, but it's true. It just seems that at some point I lost focus on the big picture, there were a couple of confusing parts regarding the titan formula which weren't clarified. There is no in-game journal which explains the story.Negatives:- The boss fights are more or less the same, using evading dives and batarangs to stun. This pattern is repeated throughout many of the boss encounters, nothing really exciting.- Downloadable content is a joke, it doesn't add anything extra to the story or any new levels. It merely adds more beat em' up challenges..Overall Score: 7.5/10Batman: Arkham Aslyum is definitely not a 9/10 game as Metacritic would claim. But it's still good and it's still fun (plus a little irritating too lol). As the first game in the series I'd say it's well worth playing this, be sure to pick it up on sale where it regularly goes down to $5.			"

It has a fun and exciting story and enjoyable gameplay, Even though it hasn't much of an open world, it still has fun riddlers puzzles and Easter eggs to find. The gameplay controls are ok and there is a lot of things that needed to be improved in the combat and flying techniques that were improved in the next game.			"

												I've never played super-hero games before...always was a Gordon Freeman type of guy.  I bought Batman: Arkham Asylum on a whim when it was on sale at one of the obscenely (sp?) cheap prices during the Steam Summer Sale.  I initially played it over a long week-end, and it turned out to be the best investment I've made in a long time.I mean, even if you're not a comics fan, who doesn't know the legend of Batman and his insanely comical adversaries  (Joker, Riddler, Scarecrow, Poison Ivy)?  The game ended up testing both my combat skills (acquired after long hours as Ezio in AC), and my stealth skills (acquired after long hours as Agent 47), and it ended up being one hella great week-end.Great buy, and at $5 for the GOTY edition, you can't go wrong.  Just pass on your next Big Mac, and you'll find a much more satisfying experience in this goofy offering that certainly caters to our current need for some kind of hero in the corrupt world we live in.

												What is there to say really? This is a phenomenally good game.It has an interesting story, great villains, good combat system, sweet gadgets, enticing collectibles and is actually pretty bug free from what I can tell.You play Batman in 3rd person and you're here to stop the Joker (and various other super criminals), who has taken over Arkham Asylum. On your mission you will be able to explore a relatively open world (The Arkham Isle as well as several enclosed ""levels""), in which you can find well hidden trophies and solve riddles by the Riddler, which unlock more lore information and give you some points for your next level up, but nothing really essential. It's a great way to break the monotony of ""run, fight, repeat"". You will also get several gadgets over the course of the story, unlocking even more ways to fight your enemies and reach new locations.The combat system is just fluent, attack, block, special attacks against certain enemies. A good player would be able to not take a single point of damage in this game, since the system is pretty much flawless and any damage you take is definitely your fault. There is no cheese here. Enemies attack you in succession, but don't swarm you, so you can always block. This is how the system is designed and it works very well. Fighting better and upgrading your combat capabilities means taking out enemies faster.The upgrades usually provide some quality of life changes and some new ways to play the game or make you more resilient. It's not spectacular, but not bad either.You also have access to a ""detective mode"", which lets you see things you can interact with, such as destructible walls or trophies, etc. The problem is that this mode is so important to actually seeing stuff that you're basically playing the whole game with it being activated and that kinda screws the pretty nice graphics over...My biggest gripe would be with the Batclaw (upgraded), because it takes ages to take down a barrier, while tapping A like a madman, and the ""challenges"", which are just a set of ""fight this for x rounds"" or ""knock out all enemies in a room as fast as possible"". There are about a Dozen of them or so, and they're not that easy to get a good grade on, but I found them rather dull, so I left them out. Apart from that the game is 100% for me, which happens very rarely.A must buy imho if you're either into Batman or 3rd person fighting games with some Metroidvania aspects.			"

												I'm a huge fan of DC Comics, so for there to be a well recieved Batman game to me was a blessing. A small portion of his rogue's gallery is showcased in the asylum, most well known with a few lesser popular baddies making an appearance. Sometimes the game is just a button mashing punchfest but then you get to unique bosses like Scarecrow and Killer Croc and it's such a treat. I would classify this game as a ""3D Beat 'Em Up"". And as far as that genre goes, the pacing of fights, is really good. You're Batman so you're encouraged to use stealth, and if walk in a room and see a group of baddies that's usually all you have to take at. Now spawning of what feels like a million minions to button mash through to the point where the game isn't fun. Looking at you Deadpool.Anyways, I love this game as a Batman fan and a Gamer. If you even like Batman a little bit you should play this.			"

												Arkham Asylum, at the time of this review, is a bit aged (released in 2010, this is 2016), yet still manages to hold it's own admist the newer generation of gameplay and graphics.Already being a fan of Batman and DC since a child, I was extremely excited to try out the first real Batman game, and I was pleasantly surprised with a game that actually is better than many other games, even given it's semi-un-original content and linear storyline based on plot information that most people, even non-DC/Batman fans already know.The game takes place in Arkham Asylum, an island in the city of Gotham, Bruce Wayne/Batman's domain.  The island goes under quarantine after Joker escapes his captivity and leads the various villains and criminals to control the island.As previously stated, the story-line, is semi-unique.  It hasn't been told exactly before (afaik), but it's fairly predictable if you're familiar with the universe.  Even so, the story is rich, characters have backstory and development and well-done voice acting and dialog in general.The combat system is the classic Assassin's Creed II combat system.  Lots of hand to hand and ""press Y to counter"" combat, with lots of gadgets, specials, combos, score multipliers and other abilities.  The combat is very fluid and fun, but may get a bit repetitive for some after a while.The game world is semi-open.  You have free reign over the island and it's buildings to do the missions, or go explore for collectibles (a lot of these by the way).  This is of course permitting you've reached the story points that allow access to the locations in question.The collectibles, while there are an abundance, are all useful.  Collectibles unlock backstore to the creator of the Asylum and it's history, cell-tapes from various villains, backstory on villains or important characters, concept art and challenge maps.The graphics, for a 2010 game in 2016, are still pretty damn good, so nothing to worry about here.Keyboard and mouse controls are a bit clunky/confusing and don't work to well, due to the console -> PC porting of the game, unfortunately, but with a controller, the gameplay is stellar, and goes without a hitch.Definitely worth picking up, although at $20 for a 6 year old game, personally, I'd wait for a sale, even though the game is very good and still likely worth $20 for most.

												Batman Arkham Asylum: Game of the Year EditionPositives:+ The game has an interesting selection of gadgets to use. There's the batclaw, which is used to pull vent grates off walls, explosive gel to destroy structurally weak areas and the cryptographic sequencer, which allows Batman to overload security terminals and gain access to restricted areas. There's also batarangs and the line launcher, which is a portable device that fires a zip line for Batman.+ The characters are good, they all have personality except for Batman himself, who seems to be very straightforward and lacking in emotion. Joker is a particular standout and the audio tapes found around the Aslyum shed light on various inmates who are Batman's foes.+ Decent graphics.+Game length is anywhere between 20-30 hours or so, depending on how many riddles you solve and your desire to play beat em' up challenge mode.Mixed:~ The combat can be fun, but also borderline infuriating at times.

												Batman Arkham Asylum GOTY, Released 27 March 2010. Here's my review:Pros:+ Awesome Story+ Awesome Gameplay. Sandbox-like, Predator mode, Combat mode, Riddles by Riddler.+ Awesome combat system, developed by WB Games(?) cool counter attack system, makes it like a true Batman+ Riddles by Riddler makes player want to play again and solve the mysteries+ Still playable until this time, 2016.Cons:- I have a crash in the time where Batman went to the morgue, where Batman meets Scarecrow for the first time. Decent spec i have though- If you guys already play the newer released Batman Arkham Series, it feels so different and a bit bad in the combat system. But in this game's era, this combat system is so awesome. Oh yeah, not much animation for the combat too. It's like repeatable, but still good though.- After you finished the game, there aren't enemies left unless you haven't discovered some place in arkham asylum.			"

												The first superhero game that broke a ""barrier"" and an actual good and innovative superhero game, with all the elements necessary to make justice to the character, the reason this game was so good was because the game simply followed the comic books and tried to stay true to them. The enemies in the game be them bosses or not are well designed and like i said before true to the comic books, the easter eggs, the riddles, the challenges, all of that make the game even more worth it. The combat was the best aspect of the game, enemies would attack you at the same time and not wait for you to beat them one at the time, you could upgrade your character to perform better in fights and do a good variety of combos. This game also has a good stealth aspect which includes hiding, taking down enemies from gargoyles and other things. This is a worthy tribute to the Dark Knight.			"

												The Arkham series was one that eluded me till recently, I had always thought that comic book to video game adaptations were often very low in terms of quality having played quite a few of them growing up...I had the chance to get Asylum when it was released but turned it down in favour of Fallout 3. While I dont regret that decision now having Played Asylum I can definately say I regret not playing this Game sooner. It's a beautiful game oozing with stylization and razor sharp in terms of writing, trust me. The story is an absolute must for this game! all the Arkham residents are wonderfully designed and while I cant say Im utterly smitten With Harley Quinns redesign (I much prefer her original outfit) Everyone else has really had the loving touch put towards them with Mark Hamills Joker being an absolute design classic. Gameplay wise it's a mixture of Stealth and Strategy  Platforming. While I loved the Platforming elements (Planning how best to take down a room and using the guards against each other) the stealthier elements often left me feeling like it could have been a bit better. Add to this that controls can be a bit of a mixed bag in particular on keyboard and mouse the Dodge functions are frankly a bit rediculous and trying to platform in a 3D sidescrolling level can at times  be a bit messy. These are however small problems that are probably more me than the Actual controls.  For an '09 game the Graphics hold up remarkably well surpassing many of the games that came out around the same time. Thats before we even get to the fact that Batman is in this game. and as Pop culture will tell us. Batman. Is amazing. Highly reccommended easily one of the Best games 2009 has to offer. Pick it up if bored; you'll not be dissapointed.			"

												I am a huge fan of his game. The story is good. Certainly not the greatest Batman story of all time, but nevertheless it is still very good. The gameplay is amazing and much deeper than it seems. On the surface the fighting seems shallow, but it is actually very deep and complicated. The gameplay also been copied by numerous other games, none of which were able to correctly recreate the awesomeness of this combat. The scarecrow sections are incredible in terms of gameplay and atmosphere. Those three scarecrow sections are arguably the best moments of the entire Arkham series. I can't personally think of a better moment. The stealth is also awesome and the A.I of the goons is quite good. They really make you feel like The Batman.My only problem with this game is the boss fights. Specifically the fact that almost all of them are Titan battles,  especially the final battle with the Joker. . The exceptions to this rule are the aforementioned scarecrow sections and  the battle with Poison Ivy . Even then, these battles are few and far between and don't really come around enough to make them a big problem.The lore is also incredible. It isn't a chore to 100% this game because of what you earn from getting riddler trophies and answering riddles correctly. There is no completion bonus, but this game is a perfect example of the journey being better more important than the destination. This game is absolutely fantastic. One of my favourite games of all time and definitely one the best Superhero games of all time.			"

												I've never played super-hero games before...always was a Gordon Freeman type of guy.  I bought Batman: Arkham Asylum on a whim when it was on sale at one of the obscenely (sp?) cheap prices during the Steam Summer Sale.  I initially played it over a long week-end, and it turned out to be the best investment I've made in a long time.I mean, even if you're not a comics fan, who doesn't know the legend of Batman and his insanely comical adversaries  (Joker, Riddler, Scarecrow, Poison Ivy)?  The game ended up testing both my combat skills (acquired after long hours as Ezio in AC), and my stealth skills (acquired after long hours as Agent 47), and it ended up being one hella great week-end.Great buy, and at $5 for the GOTY edition, you can't go wrong.  Just pass on your next Big Mac, and you'll find a much more satisfying experience in this goofy offering that certainly caters to our current need for some kind of hero in the corrupt world we live in.

												Batman Arkham Asylum is one of the best Batman games out there.  This game takes you inside the high-security asylum where all of Gotham's famous villians are locked up.  Only, they're not exactly in their cells!  Batman must gain control of the asylum and stop the Joker and his evil agenda.  The environment and gameplay is very proper for Batman.  Everything looks dark and the gadgets and fighting are great.  The graphics, voice actors and music is awesome!  In Arkham Asylum you'll feel like Batman more than ever.Pros:+Gameplay+Graphics+Gadgets and Fighting+Music+Voice Actors+Able to take out enemies in stealthCons:-None, except that you're reading this review instead of playing Batman LOL.

												Im not normally a fan of Superhero games in general.  But ""Batman: Arkham Asylum"" was really fun.  As long as you keep an open mind, and expect more of a comic book experiance you will have a lot of fun playing this game.dont expect the Christian Bale batman here, this is more like how batman is supossed to be, nearly super-human.  Extremly strong, fast, and intelligent with an unlimited supply of tech gadgets.From grapnel, to batarang, explosive gel and more you will use all your gadgets to foil the jokers plans here.  Some very tough but rewarding fights will be had as well.  this game really lets you step inside the shoes of the iconic batman character.Music and sound effects are excellent, but you would expect that with a big budget game.this game is a definate must try for anyone who is a fan of Superhero games, or fighting games in general.The only drawback ive found is that the main game itself (not the sidegames and challenge modes) is pretty short, clocking in at just over 10 hours of gameplay... and this game wont offer much in the way of replayabilityid give it a solid 8.5 / 10			"

												I am going to make a confession, I wasn't really that interested in Batman before I got this game. However, I gave this game a shot and I have to say, I am happy I did. You play as Batman, (obviously) and he is sending Joker to Arkham Asylum, but it looks like he let Batman send him there a little too easy. It turns out that this was part of Joker's secret plan and he takes control of the Asylum killing many people in it. There is an amazing combat system in the game, easy to learn and get used to. There is also wonderful stealth sections, those were prehaps my favourite parts of the game. I haven't mentioned everything about the game, like the amazing Scarecrow sections, that is for you to see. Batman Arkham Asylum should take you about 10-15 hours on your first try, and I think it is worth the 20 dollars.  "

												This is one of the best Batman games of all time. It's VERY Batman with voices from the TV show, including Mark Hammel reprising his role as The Joker! This is a fantastic game that should be used as a way to tell other people who make games based on pre-exsisting intellectual licences how to get it right.Though Arkham Island isn't as big as locations in the later games, it is filled with a very rich and beautiful areas with many different characters to run into from the infamous ones like Scarecrow or Bane to the more obscure ones like Zassaz and info on many others that sadly don't make an appearence.The end boss fight is something many people dislike and I can understand why, but it fits the story and the overall game is really awesome too. I'd highly recommend it if you didn't own it already.			"

												Honestly, I expected better. This is yet another console port (are there native PC games anymore?!), with the usual problems of console ports. Like what? You name it: mediocre controls, especially during fights (there is something with timing and combat flow and all that, it basically means that you have to press the exact button at the right moment the game expects you to do so; more or less equivalent to the ideas behind QTEs); ultra-linear plot (go there, do that, rinse, repeat), repetitive gameplay (you will encounter two main types of ennemies: melee fighters, and ranged fighers. And quite rarely, a stronger melee figher type) with the same strategies all along the way, and so on.Of course there are worse games out there; but we're not searching for the worst game, are we? So to summarize, this game has an experience which goes from amusing to boring, with an average much closer to boring; can cause an impressive amount of frustration at times (especially when fighting, something which is not really interesting to begin with, given the small amount of strategy you can use; it's more of a standardized suite of buttons to press, as an answer to a visual stimuli the game shows you); it has an okay plot, and is worth playing once, provided that you stop playing as soon as you feel the frustration growing in you; and get back to it later. Not a game I would recommend to people prone to easy anger. In any case, the replay value is close to null, and to be honest (I'm writing the review as I do a second play-through, for achievements - I waited two years or so, since I did swear to myself that I would never touch it again, after the first one), I would advise anyone to avoid it at all costs. Too bad, a Batman game would have the potential to be so much better... =/Bottom line: More or less okay game, if possible get it on a sale, and play it once, with small sessions preferably.			"

												Most superhero games aren’t very good. But Arkham Asylum changed that. It made people say, ‘Finally! A superhero game that doesn’t suck!’ Batman Arkham Asylum is about Batman (duh) getting trapped in Arkham Asylum (also duh). Unfortunately he is trapped with some of the most dangerous criminals in all of Gotham, including the Joker, Killer Croc, Poison Ivy and Scarecrow.The game controls aren’t too hard to figure out. You use the mouse to look around and to attack and block. Space to run, and ctrl to crouch. Every time you knock down a thug you get experience points. Get enough of them and you can level up. Levelling up allows you to pick an upgrade, such as armour improvements and new abilities. Obviously you can’t have a Batman game without gadgets, so throughout the game you will unlock many, including batarangs, grapple gun, and oh, did I mention explosives?The Boss fights/Areas are quite varied, from overcoming Scarecrows fear gas, to sneaking through the sewers trying not to be eaten by Killer Croc. Although one problem I had with the game was the fact that Bane wasn’t smart. Instead all he does is through things at you and ram you. But that’s pretty much my only problem with the game.If this game was a spoon, it would a good spoon.I’m giving this game spoon/10 "

I want to throw a batrang i do the counter. Alerting guards. I do a Stealth takedown near a ladder. I go up the ladder. 11/10Lol.			"

												Most superhero games aren’t very good. But Arkham Asylum changed that. It made people say, ‘Finally! A superhero game that doesn’t suck!’ Batman Arkham Asylum is about Batman (duh) getting trapped in Arkham Asylum (also duh). Unfortunately he is trapped with some of the most dangerous criminals in all of Gotham, including the Joker, Killer Croc, Poison Ivy and Scarecrow.The game controls aren’t too hard to figure out. You use the mouse to look around and to attack and block. Space to run, and ctrl to crouch. Every time you knock down a thug you get experience points. Get enough of them and you can level up. Levelling up allows you to pick an upgrade, such as armour improvements and new abilities. Obviously you can’t have a Batman game without gadgets, so throughout the game you will unlock many, including batarangs, grapple gun, and oh, did I mention explosives?The Boss fights/Areas are quite varied, from overcoming Scarecrows fear gas, to sneaking through the sewers trying not to be eaten by Killer Croc. Although one problem I had with the game was the fact that Bane wasn’t smart. Instead all he does is through things at you and ram you. But that’s pretty much my only problem with the game.If this game was a spoon, it would a good spoon.I’m giving this game spoon/10 "

												I remember when I first played this game I expected a failure. I heard nothing about this game. I just borrowed it from a friend (who didn't play it at the time), because since I was a kid I loved Batman. I was BLOWN AWAY by this game. I played it through in just one go. Man, I loved it. I was so happy that the franchise finally caught up in cinema and gaming industry!

												In this game you're Batmen, The Knight of Darkness. The title of the hero is very misleading, as he isn't even a knight. He doesn't have a sword, he doesn't ride a horse, he never goes to the jousting area, he doesn't fight for the hand of the pure maiden. Instead he runs through some kind of hospital and then on the rooftops, throwing pieces of metal at everyone he doesn't like. Given how utterly ridiculous the ""knight"" is, I'd say there's no way this game isn't Japanese.His enemies include the Prankster (big boss but funny) and his girlfriend Hairy Quinn (complete rip-off of a name of Leauge of Legends champion. She doesn't even have a bird!), Searching-Lights Man (scary), that green enemy thing from Hulk (I love when they use the characters from the same universe) and many more. They are strong, but not as strong as Batmen. Maybe it's because I used cheat codes.I loved the initial metagame battle (most likely prepared by Prankster) of ""Game for Windows"". It truly made me feel like I'm playing a superior PC version. I laughed at the top of my lungs when I found out my randomly generared name was PrecutRainbow20. Like, they had to cut a twenty pieces of rainbow to make the game work! Prankster truly is the master of pranks.Overall I give this game this game a score of  3.211336+e of 3.7			"

Short ReviewArkham Asylum is a great portrayal of Batman and the lore surrounding him and those related to the asylum. Although the game is a bit linear without an open world (Gotham - as seen in Arkham City/Knight), it is still a great game and requirement in order to enjoy the Arkham series. The game mechanics is a bit outdated comparatively to teh other entries in the series but it still plays rather well, including the famous combat style. ScoreMasterpiece- 10/10			"

												This game is pretty cool. It's too arcady for me but I like it sometimes. 90% of the game seems to be collectibles and solving mysteries and stuff and the rest of the 10% is fighting bad guys.Boss fights are pretty much what you'd expect in a fighting game, the big guy charges you and you gotta jump to the side to make him smack into the wall and incapacitate himself.It's not that impressive, really. It's fun at times though. Such as when you look at someone with the batvision and you can see their heartrate and see if they're nervous or calm. The gadgets are pretty cool aswell. It doesn't really feel like you're playing Batman though which kinda ruins it for me. It's too cartoony. Some people love that but I don't. This game is the old Batman where the Joker isn't a ""normal"" guy but instead someone who fell into toxic waste.If you like running around trying to find three thousand collectibles while fighting generic bad guys with kinky leather collars on as Batman then this game is for you.

												If someone were to ask me what was my favorite Superhero game. Arkham Asylum would pop into my head first. It's as close to being Batman(aside from it's sequels) as it gets.Game starts out with Batman having captured the Joker yet again and brought him back to the asylum. Shortly after bringing him in, Joker escapes custody and it comes apparent that he had planned this all along and Harley Quinn had taken control of the Arkham's security systems. So Batman sets out on the hunt for the Joker to stop him from whatever he is planning.The visuals are stunning and still hold up and they convey Gotham's dark Gothic scenery perfectly. The audio work is equally as good with solid voice acting from everyone especially Mark Hamill's Joker. The combat in the game utilizes a fluid simple to use but difficult to master system allowing you make to make combos from one enemy to the next. Batman also carries a wide variety of tools and gadget to allowing him to fight crime such as his trademark batarang for knocking out enemies and his grappling hook for reaching ledges from a distance as well pulling on enemies or opening new ways to go and  in his cowl he has system that allows him to detect pretty much everything around, like evidence, location of enemies and more. He acquires more as you play through the game.Aside from the main objective there are also a ton of extra things to uncover like riddles and prizes that the Riddler has hidden all over Arkham Island. There are also tapes with treatment sessions with some of Batman's greatest adversaries and markings left by a mysterious unknown called the Spirit of Arkham.Main storyline is great and involves many of Batman's greatest enemies and will leave you satisfied at the end when you beat it and when you do you'll have a ton of riddles and secrets to keep you busy for awhile longer.Gets my thumbs up!

												Amazing first game in the Batman Arkham series.The atmosphere is dark adn creepy and left me with the light on at night. I  think this is the perfect atmosphere for teh arkham games.And the voice acting is great they got kevin conroy for batman and mark hamill for joker, teh same as the animated series I used to watch, it just adds to the feel of the game when you hear that iconic joker voice. And the story is great I beat it in 8 hours but it was in one playthrough could have last me a month. Basically jokers gets into arkham and controls everything,lets all the criminals wander the halls and stuff and you have to stop him while criminals are trying to stop you like harley quinn,scarecrow (which had a amazing boss battle every few thours),poison ivy, killer croc.bane and teh riddler. 9.7/10 amazing game.

												Meh.It's... It's alright, I guess.I've heard people praise this game up and down for years, so I finally got a copy of it on sale. Unfortunately, it seems to have been an interesting combat system and location history with a cookie-cutter, Batman VS. Joker story pasted over it. Halfway through I got impatient, realized that there were better things I wanted to do with my time, frankly, and deleted it off my computer.I might play it again, but probably not.That said, if you enjoy this sort of thing, this game'll be fantastic for you, and I highly recommend it in that case.Cheers!-Camolot			"

It's really fun to get all those audio files and biographies.Up next: Batman Arkham City! :D			"

												Fantastic game. I thought that the amazing reviews were wrong or askew or something, but this really truly is an amazing game. The gameplay mechanics and controls are really fluid and easy to get used to, you really feel like you're controlling Batman. The music is almost as good as the actual Hans Zimmer Batman soundtrack. The story is great and makes me actually care about the characters. It feels like a ramped up arcade game or something, it's just done sooo well. The only downside to it is that it's hard as♥♥♥♥♥♥and extremely frustrating, especially towards the end. The two boss battles before the final one are mindblowingly difficult, especially with the controls you're given. However, the final battle is nothing much, so it's a bit underwhelming. All I can say is that if this game is this good, and everyone is saying that Arkham City is better, then I can't wait to try that out. 10/10			"

												I'm not much of a Batman fan, but even so, this game is just amazing.It looks great, the fighting feels superb and is absolutely fluid (although it may look a bit weird at times) and the voice actors are top notch, although Mark Hamill (ya know, Luke Skywalker) as Joker easily steals the show.Discover Arkham Asylum, one of the most (in)famous places in Gotham City as one of the best known comic heroes of all times.Use a wide variety of gadgets, fight lots of bad guys, normal and super and discover the dark secrets of Arkham.There's also a lot to find! Riddler trophies are hidden everywhere, unlocking character bios, artwork and infos. And while I liked the amount of detail in these things, I'm not a big fan of running around the level over and over again to catch 'em all, but if you're into that, you'll have a great time ;)Fantastic game, all things considered!

												Batman: Arkham Asylum is a different take on Super Hero games.  While you are a super hero, you are a man with gadgets...blah blah blah, you know who Batman is.This game is incredible because the flow of combat is amazingly fluid and works extremely well.  There is no one way to attack a group of enemies, and the story really wraps you in to this world of Arkham.Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy do the voices of the Joker and the Batman, so you already get that great feeling listening to the Joker laughing at the Batman that you are a kid again.This game is really fun, and i have beaten it twice a year since it has been released.5 out of 5			"

As the asylum is taken over by jokers thugs the BAT works his way through the complex slowly but surely bringing justice and restoring order. Once thats dealt with there is still a TON of extra achievements to complete and challenges to keep you busy for many hours(Don't forget to download the JOKER challenge maps!)			"

A good story line, quite a bit of bat-cannon and information, interesting use of locations, and a whole mess of extra challenges to test your button mashing with.  Definitely should be played with a controller.  About 17 hours to go through the story, beat it, collect all the Riddler's things, and ready to tackle the challenges.			"

												If someone were to ask me what was my favorite Superhero game. Arkham Asylum would pop into my head first. It's as close to being Batman(aside from it's sequels) as it gets.Game starts out with Batman having captured the Joker yet again and brought him back to the asylum. Shortly after bringing him in, Joker escapes custody and it comes apparent that he had planned this all along and Harley Quinn had taken control of the Arkham's security systems. So Batman sets out on the hunt for the Joker to stop him from whatever he is planning.The visuals are stunning and still hold up and they convey Gotham's dark Gothic scenery perfectly. The audio work is equally as good with solid voice acting from everyone especially Mark Hamill's Joker. The combat in the game utilizes a fluid simple to use but difficult to master system allowing you make to make combos from one enemy to the next. Batman also carries a wide variety of tools and gadget to allowing him to fight crime such as his trademark batarang for knocking out enemies and his grappling hook for reaching ledges from a distance as well pulling on enemies or opening new ways to go and  in his cowl he has system that allows him to detect pretty much everything around, like evidence, location of enemies and more. He acquires more as you play through the game.Aside from the main objective there are also a ton of extra things to uncover like riddles and prizes that the Riddler has hidden all over Arkham Island. There are also tapes with treatment sessions with some of Batman's greatest adversaries and markings left by a mysterious unknown called the Spirit of Arkham.Main storyline is great and involves many of Batman's greatest enemies and will leave you satisfied at the end when you beat it and when you do you'll have a ton of riddles and secrets to keep you busy for awhile longer.Gets my thumbs up!

												I'm not a fan of super heros, for the most part. They're generally extremes of either corny and childish, or trying too hard to be mature and edgy.That being said, as far as games go, this was was actually fresh, varied, and consistantly fun throughout its entirity. I didn't have to like the whole comic book ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to appreciate it, which is a plus. Variety of platforming, stealth, buttonmash fighting, detectivising, and movement puzzles.I don't really have much to say aside from that though, I mean the storyline was pretty bland, the character development was virtually non existant (largely in part to the characters already having-been developed on paper), and it's always a little weird that batman is cool with throwing sharp metal♥♥♥♥♥♥at peoples' faces, yet doesn't just carry a gun or tazer, and make it simple.All in all, worth checking out, not a waste of money. Nothing amazing, but plenty of fun while it lasted. I mean, ♥♥♥♥, at least it's not another call of duty.			"

												Finally someone does a Batman game worthy of the name, beautiful, engrosing and fun.It's a bit linear, the ""open world"" environment is all but closed off until you get the right ""key"", and once you have it you're forced to return to the location exactly once.The game is slightly ruined by a horrific console control system, but get yourself a 360 controller and it's playable.

												i got arkham city first, so this game was underwhelming and not as well made, as you might expect.  however, it was the first in the series with a lot of lore and storytelling that would help for the other two games and to truly immerse yourself in the batman experience.  if you wanna play this game and have already played knight/city or even origins, let's hope there're some really good texture mods out there.

												I'm not a fan of super heros, for the most part. They're generally extremes of either corny and childish, or trying too hard to be mature and edgy.That being said, as far as games go, this was was actually fresh, varied, and consistantly fun throughout its entirity. I didn't have to like the whole comic book ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to appreciate it, which is a plus. Variety of platforming, stealth, buttonmash fighting, detectivising, and movement puzzles.I don't really have much to say aside from that though, I mean the storyline was pretty bland, the character development was virtually non existant (largely in part to the characters already having-been developed on paper), and it's always a little weird that batman is cool with throwing sharp metal♥♥♥♥♥♥at peoples' faces, yet doesn't just carry a gun or tazer, and make it simple.All in all, worth checking out, not a waste of money. Nothing amazing, but plenty of fun while it lasted. I mean, ♥♥♥♥, at least it's not another call of duty.			"

												Everyone knows who Batman is so let's just get to it.This game makes you feel like batman.  You get to beat up thugs, solve crimes, use gadjets.  It's an easy choice.  Does being Batman sound like a good time to you?  If yes, then this is the game for you. It honestly is as simple as that.  If you think it needs more of an introduction.  You're wrong.  It really is simple as that.It's not as well polished and easy to play as its predecors, so if you need to choose between the three Batman games in the series (Asylum, City, and Knight) I would go with Akrham City.  But as long as you have time to get it in.  This is a stellar game.			"

												I AM THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BATMAN.So the first time I played this game, I didn't like it very much, and I didn't keep playing it. A few months later, I realised I clearly had a slowness of the brain and set about fixing this. Who doesn't want to be Batman? No one, that's who. If anything, this game should appeal to the raging man-beasts who use Steam as it shows you a number of ways to sneak up on unsuspecting victims. Girl giving you a hard chase in the club? She won't be when you hang upside down from a nearby decorative cornerpiece in the gothic-themed club you're in and swing her through the air. Getting bullied IRL by your local thugs? E.Z. Once you dress up as a bat and run at them growling you're not going to have ANY problems anymore.THIS GAME WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE.  "

With this game you can!Batman has just recaptured The Joker and is taking him back to Arkham Asylum. Once there however, the Joker turns the tables on his nemesis and, with the help of Harley Quinn, takes over the asylum. It's up to you, as the Batman himself to chase down the Joker and defeat him once and for all! Or at least until the next time he escapes! This game is packed with so much to do, it'll take you days to finish everything. From hidden items to challenges to DLC, this game will keep you entertained and occupied for quite awhile. Definitely worth a purchase.			"

												I am not going to make any comparisons to Arkham City and just discuss this as a standalone game.  The game is fun although relatively easy.  The fight mechanics provides you with a fun stealth and combat system that allows you to approach situations involving enemies  in your own way.  I liked the story in that it incorporated many Batman villains and I really liked what they did with Scarecrow.  However the part with Killer Croc is stupid and I can't even describe how dumb the ending with the Joker is.  Also, there was never any reason to turn off your ""detective vision"" that revealed hidden paths and secrets, so unless if you really want to admire the art and environments, you can play the entire game with detective vision turned on.  It's a fun, although flawed, game that does a decent job at breathing life into the Batman comics.			"

												If someone were to ask me what was my favorite Superhero game. Arkham Asylum would pop into my head first. It's as close to being Batman(aside from it's sequels) as it gets.Game starts out with Batman having captured the Joker yet again and brought him back to the asylum. Shortly after bringing him in, Joker escapes custody and it comes apparent that he had planned this all along and Harley Quinn had taken control of the Arkham's security systems. So Batman sets out on the hunt for the Joker to stop him from whatever he is planning.The visuals are stunning and still hold up and they convey Gotham's dark Gothic scenery perfectly. The audio work is equally as good with solid voice acting from everyone especially Mark Hamill's Joker. The combat in the game utilizes a fluid simple to use but difficult to master system allowing you make to make combos from one enemy to the next. Batman also carries a wide variety of tools and gadget to allowing him to fight crime such as his trademark batarang for knocking out enemies and his grappling hook for reaching ledges from a distance as well pulling on enemies or opening new ways to go and  in his cowl he has system that allows him to detect pretty much everything around, like evidence, location of enemies and more. He acquires more as you play through the game.Aside from the main objective there are also a ton of extra things to uncover like riddles and prizes that the Riddler has hidden all over Arkham Island. There are also tapes with treatment sessions with some of Batman's greatest adversaries and markings left by a mysterious unknown called the Spirit of Arkham.Main storyline is great and involves many of Batman's greatest enemies and will leave you satisfied at the end when you beat it and when you do you'll have a ton of riddles and secrets to keep you busy for awhile longer.Gets my thumbs up!

												I'M BATMANNNNNNor, rather,YOU'RE BATMANNNNNin the best possible way ever.The original, best Batman game, probably ever. It's fantastic. It plays sort of like a metroidvania, in the sense that there's plenty of places to explore, but you can't get into every locked box or clearly breakable wall just right away, no, you have to backtrack to come back to those after you've got the proper kit for it. A great, fantastic game. The combat is a slightly more watered down version of Assassin's Creed. There's two moves, essentially, hit bad dude, or 'parry' bad dude - read: redirect his clumsy attack, and use it to beat him into unconsciousness.I've played it through a couple times now. And I cannot say they could have done better with it. With voice actors from the animated series, fans of that are sure to recognize the cheery tones of Mark Hamill as the Joker (and honestly I still think he did it best).The best part of this game is by far the boss fights. They're all rather easy, you always know exactly what you have to do to beat every boss, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, I think I'd prefer to know what's going on, rather than have to guess work my way through every fight. And the segments with Scarecrow... oh wow. Oh wow. Those are the best part of it.The game also looks beautiful. I mean spectacular. Batman has never looked so good.If you are into Batman, or merely curious as I was, here you go, an excellent introduction to the character, and basically all the enemies that have ever mattered.

												Batman: Arkham Asylum is a different take on Super Hero games.  While you are a super hero, you are a man with gadgets...blah blah blah, you know who Batman is.This game is incredible because the flow of combat is amazingly fluid and works extremely well.  There is no one way to attack a group of enemies, and the story really wraps you in to this world of Arkham.Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy do the voices of the Joker and the Batman, so you already get that great feeling listening to the Joker laughing at the Batman that you are a kid again.This game is really fun, and i have beaten it twice a year since it has been released.5 out of 5			"

												I am a new gamer, and was nervous about trying this one out. But hey, it has an easy mode for those of us new to this kind of thing. haha. The plot is wicked, the voice acting really takes the cake, and the game play rocks. It\'s fairly intuitive, and ports into the steam controller great! So glad I decided to try this after another steamer suggested it for me.			"

												Great game ! This game remind me about Batman the movie when I was a child. :)Combat isn't very complicate. So you can focus on story line.Puzzle(Riddle) in this game is so fun and isn't hard. Mini game is still fun and challenge.I reccomend to play in Hard mode. :)  "

												This is truly one of the best superhero video game adaptation there is right now. From the combat to the story this game immersed me like no other solo game did. I finished this game in a week because I was too into it and the next, Arkham City, in a weekend. The joker in those games is just amazing, his expressions are totally getting out of the screen.For anyone that likes solo games, action games or just games in general, this game and this franchise is a must have.
