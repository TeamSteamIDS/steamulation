												Sit down, son. You just stumbled upon the page of the best shooter ever made. Pay some respect. Before the days of shooters that holds your hand and aim for you, that regenerate your health and show you what to do like a baby, there was this. Unreal Tournament 2004 - the most brutal, adrenalin-fueled shooter since Quake 3 Arena, a game so fast-paced its guaranteed you'll burn your eyes from not blinking for so long. They say we only use 20% of our brains - well, if you play this game on the hardest difficulty, you'll be using 100% i assure you. Holy hell son, this game uses so much of your brain it pretty much even cures autism. This game is filled with so much testosterone you have to shave your beard every forty minutes of gametime.Gameplay wise, this game is delicious. With an amazing arsenal of creative, varied and badass weapons, its certified there is a gun for everyone and every situation - sniper rifles that shoot lightning bolts, a triple rocket launcher, jesus christ did i mention a shotgun that shoots grenades too? (The Flak Cannon, considered the number 1 best gun of all times by PC Gamer). Also, with the ability of limitless dodging, walljumping and even double-jumping, the potential for amazing acrobatic moves to evade your enemy's attacks are so great not even Dante from Devil May Cry can keep up. Yep: he cries every night because he cant be as badass as you, when you're playing this game. But this is the bare basic - to survive in the Online arenas, you better be backflipping over your enemies and giving them an instagib headshot while upside down. That's how you play this. However, to be good you have to have absolute keyboard coordination and aiming abilities - it aint easy to do those moves while scoring headshots airborne. Its so hardcore, they say ninjas have to play this game to graduate in Ninja School as their last test. I'm not even kidding. The maps are varied, from skyscrapers reaching space and low-grav to gothic dungeons, futuristic egyptian pyramids to spaceships blasting in hyperspace - there are over 140 maps in this game (thats almost 5 times more than any CoD), ranging from Deathmatch maps to Capture the Flag, Double Domination, Onslaught (Battlefield-esque map node domination), Assault (from the original UT) and even Bombing Run (Its soccer. WITH GUNS). And kid, that's not even taking into account the thousands of maps released by fans - that's right, the modding community is huge for this game. (No DLC crap, no. You get all those maps and access to mod maps for free. Welcome to oldschool shooters)The soundtrack and graphics certainly do not falter. We get badass tracks like the one in DM-Asbestos, and others have more epic orchestral music (for actual epic scenes: assaulting an alien mothership to save Earth) and the graphics, for their time, were considered to be amazing (Even modern games, like Killing Floor, use this game engine as base). The visual and audio presentation certainly do not lack, but to this day this game isnt known for having pretty trees, its known for being the best shooter of all times and god damn it does it right. Together with the classic Unreal Tournament and Quake 3 Arena, Unreal Tournament 2004 is known by shooter veterans worldwide to be the best competitive shooter experience that ever existed. Think you're ready for that? Take off the Angry Birds shirt, the Casual of Duty cap and get ready for a terrific head-hunting experience with the game that INVENTED Double-Kills, Headshots and Killing-Sprees (that all games rip-off nowadays).Final Score: 10/10			"

												In my opinion, this is the single greatest arena first person shooter of all time. When it comes to competitive play, absolutely nothing beats this game. This game itches absolutely every desire I have for an arena shooter perfectly.From the fast paced movement to the weapons sandbox, it plays like a dream. No other game thus far has impressed me as much as Epic has with this game. The dodging system adds skill that compliments other skills such as tactical skill and aiming skill.One of the biggest complaints I have with modern games on PC is a lack of features. This game features a full editing kit, great community driven content, a hub to display that content and a plethora of other features that hardly any other games have in comparison. Yes, that does include a FoV slider. The thing that all FPS games should have no matter what.If this game were to only be available by going to E-Bay and paying $200 for it, I would in a heartbeat. If you're a fan of arena shooter games like Quake, you're really missing out if you haven't played this. If you want to try out arena shooters for the first time, this is your best choice. I have personally bought this game for a good few people simply because of how much I believe in it. Get it now.			"

												Played UT2004 an insane amount when it came out, and up until a few years ago. Once I saw it on here, I had to get it again. It is just as awesome as it always has been.

												This is THE game that got me into gaming, I was 9 when I started playing it in 2004 and I still come back every now and then to play some good 'ol Unreal.Almost every game-mode is fun and well designed, they range from regular old Deathmatch to Capture the Flag with Ion-Canon tanks and Jeeps with blades on them, invasion was always my favorite, it was so well designed in fact that games like Killing Floor were born from it.The weapons are also a blast to use, PC Gamer even crowned Unreal's 'Flak Cannon' the best gun in PC gaming, but it doesn't end there, the are plasma and laser guns to mess around with, but you also have your trusty old rocket launcher and even a steerable mini-nuke. If you don't like messing around with such a huge arsenal you can play with an Instagib instead, which is a slow-firing weapon with 100% accuracy that instantly kills (and gibs, as the name suggests) anything you hit with it.Another thing that made it so vastly different from all the boring arena shooters we have nowadays was the crazy mobility, you could do double jumps or jump against a wall and then jump from there again, leading to some pretty hectic but awesome gameplay, you could enable a handy little device called the Translocator that allowed you to shoot a disc and teleport to it with a simple click, making camping virtually impossible.The game has tons of maps from itself, but Unreal has a very lively modding community and thus hunderds of maps for every game-mode are available for download, you can also download costum skins and even entirely new weapons, just a shame that the game has no steam-workshop.Even though the game is pretty old by now, there's still a reasonable amount of people playing this gem, if you want to play one of the best sci-fi shooters on the market I'd suggest giving this one a go (And not Unreal Tournament 2007, it didn't live up to the standard of the Unreal franchise in my opinion).

												Unreal Tournament 20049 / 10 (2004)When released in 2004 this was the third iteration in the seminal Unreal Tournament franchise. Renowed for intense and over the top deathmatch in single player and multiplayer mode, this game delivered unprecedented adrenaline overload and cumulative sleep deprivation following installation to your hard drive. I installed this game (2015) and played single player mode on a W7Pro 64bit / Radeon 6870 without any hassles and no 3rd party DRM. I reconfigured my keys in game to my traditional FPS set up and was fragging away within minutes, and then came the adrenaline, I loved it. This was my first time playing this particular release; the controls are responsive, the weapons (10) balanced and very tight, and the giblets abound. I played for an hour on maximum graphics quality without a single hiccup. I did not test multiplayer.Previous versions that I have owned and played extensively include Unreal Tournament, Unreal Championship (Xbox), Unreal Tournament GOTY (2000 PC / XP), and  Unreal Tournament 3 (2007 PC / XP). This version fits perfectly in the expected rank of the series for graphics, map design, and audio quality which of course was top notch for 2004. This Hall of Fame franchise belongs in everybodies collection.Q: Why did I install this game? A: They added cards. It's madness ; ) [note: I purchased this in 2010 in a bundle, not just for the cards!]Buy this game Unreal Tournament 2004 if you want to taste classic deathmatch style with polished maps and gameplay from this era. Purchase Unreal Tournament 3 (2007) if you want more recent graphics with much larger and better maps, improved graphics and more complex gameplay options.Addendum From wikipedia (PC release dates)Unreal Tournament (1999)Unreal Tournament 2003 (2002)Unreal Tournament 2004 (2004) *Unreal Tournament 3 (2007)Unreal Tournament 4 (2015 pre-alpha)			"

												Many a day of my life was lost playing this game as an early teen. I returned to it now, 7 years later and it still smokes any non-military (meaning not in the vein of CS, Battlefield etc.) competitive shooter out there.As AlexOfSpades put it, ""before the days of shooters that holds your hand and aim for you, that regenerate your health and show you what to do like a baby, there was this."" Yes indeed. I have gotten so accustomed to these games that, when I bought this game and went straight to my old habit of a warm-up Masterful bot DM, I had my ♥♥♥ HANDED TO ME. Time. And Time. Again. Until my rusty inner gaming beast finally tossed away the awful crutches that today's games forced upon it and I once again felt the rush of a full-blown UT deathmatch.This shows what a bunch of wimps today's ""fast-paced shooters"" are made for. This game requires insane concentration, mental sharpness, quick decision making and finger/fine motorics coordination of a freaking Navy jet pilot. Stand still - dead, wrong weapon for the situation - dead, miss a powerup - dead, let the enemy pick up a health pack - dead, shoddy tactics in team matches - dead. No room for error (providing you have set the difficulty level high enough to actually be challenged). It's a wild ride and there is no better feeling than finally letting go of your poor, burned-out mouse and seeing your username at the top of the scoreboard.Technically, the game excels at everything. The weapons are perfectly balanced, the powerups are perfectly distributed, the gameplay is smooth and uninterrupted. The graphics are 2004 appropriate, but even today, they are a thing of beauty, the colors are clear and it doesn't have the murky, gray/brown ""drape"" like UT3. The only thing that kind of bugged me was no native widescreen support, but the fix is super easy, no problems there.However, as much as I can gush over the ""old days"" of adrenaline-fuelled arena bloodshed, it's dated. Not the game itself, as I said, it is arena mayhem at its most perfect, but the concept itself has sadly fallen out of fashion. There will always be devout maniacs such as myself and a lot of people who gave this game a thumbs up, but ultimately, I think there's little hope of this kind of action coming back in this form.Long story short: if you spent days trying to find a tactic to bring down a Power Core in a certain map, or spent days honing your no-scope headshots, get this, and feel the rush. If you're a modern gamer new to this game, get it, take it easy at first, up the difficulty when you feel you have the grasp, and realize that CoD is about as intense as PacMan. If you're expecting to get your mind blown by anything other than a Flak Cannon, don't get this game. This is nothing new. It is something old. And it still kicks gobs of ♥♥♥.			"

												I just bought this game during the flash sale for the sole reason of recommending it. Unfortunately, I have the 2004 original DVD version added to my account so I couldn't write a recommendation.This is the game that shaped my initial PC multiplayer gaming experience. I've logged about 4000-5000 hours (just an estimate) in the last decade. If it wasn't for this game, I probably would have discovered PC gaming much later than I initially did. Moving on to the official recommendation: the single player is very simple, but holds an interesting enough story for its time. The graphics are dated, yes, but honestly I think the game still looks very aesthetically pleasing. There is a general play mode called ""Instant Action"" where you can choose your gamemode, and play! This includes classics like deathmatch, capture-the-flag, and newer gametypes such as Bombing Run, vCTF and more. All of which are very, very fun.The multiplayer community was thriving from between the initial release of this game all the way up to about 1-2 years ago. The community is still somewhat active and there is a good 20 active servers out there with different gametypes to play. There are also several mods that you can download. The modding community within this game is still somewhat active, too. The UDK is also a great tool for learning to map.I still play this game everyday, and have done since 2004 when I was only 11 years old. It is very cheap right now (and offers trading cards, so badge collectors, it's worth the buy alone for that).This is my all-time favourite game, and if you decide to purchase it, I'll introduce you to what's left of the very tight-knit community.Buy this game.

The review is written strictly from single-player perspective!Short version: 94%UT2k4 is, with little doubt, the pinnacle of the Unreal franchise with the largest variation in game modes, best maps, biggest arsenal, and one of the best AI opponents of its time.Long version:It took almost four years for Epic to create a sequel to Unreal Tournament, and they were aiming high with a proposed yearly series. Sadly, they started with UT2003, which changed and removed so many things that despite the initial success it flopped hard: so much so that they had to release Unreal Tournament 2004 well ahead schedule. Thankfully they listened to the fans, and not only gave back every removed game element, but created an amalgam of the best features of UT2003 and UT ’99.The action is faster than ever, but not to the point where it is disadvantageous to a new player. Old weapons and map types complement the new ones, offering a variety not just in play style, but in game modes– including a Halo-inspired vehicle-using war scenario.The campaign also received an overhaul. You still need to complete all but one game type to win, but the small changes made sure that each play through can be different: instead of set maps you are given a small pool for each stage. For death match enthusiast 1v1 and team DMs are offered as optional challenges, boosting the possible team management strategies and game time to even higher levels.Some of the game modes like Bombing Run (a cross between Blood Bowl and Counter-Strike) and Double Domination (Domination with camping strategies) weren’t received well, but against bots they can be one of the fastest-paced modes you can play. And even if you dislike them, the other modes and the myriad of high-quality player-made map packs can ensure longevity even after all these years.			"

												First played this installment of the UT series 11 years ago. Nostalgia kicked in, so I had to get it on Steam (used to have the CD). Let me tell you, all these years later, it's still a blast to play, and the graphics are still great. People still play, there are still good servers running.Would recommend for veterans and newcomers alike. You are playing a PC classic when you get this game.			"

												Obviously we all know UT2k4 was one of the best games ever created. Probably one of the best FPS's ever created. But does it hold up today?Arena shooters are basically dead - the most popular one at the moment is Quake Live. So if you are looking for the current most popular shooter with the most people, go to Quake Live. Now if you are trying to re-live the glory days, you MAY have the ability do so here.People do still play this game online. Most of the servers are the Onslaught gamemode. Very little servers running TDM/DM/CTF etc. So if you were into Onslaught, your in luck. If you enjoyed just pure TDM/DM/CTF, you might have a hard time finding a server. You can easily get the game to run in 1080P, and it runs smooth on W7. So no compatability issues at all. Price wise I think $15 is a bit much for an old game, even if it was good. Make it $10 or less and I think it's worth the money. Out of all the UT's you could buy, this one is probably your best bet.			"

												While it's release saw a nearly unprecedented surge into e-sports, it's decline has been slow and community transforming into a group of avid twitch FPS players. The game remains challenging with mechanics and gameplay that will readily adapt into most other FPS games. It's fun, and the graphics remain detailed enough to go unnoticed with the fast-paced action.			"

												A pinacle of FPS games, a master piece in every respect. Unreal Tournament 2004 succeeds at being one of, if not the best  arena shooter of all time. The tight controls, excellent AI and ""unreal"" amount of mods for this game could have easily kept someone busy for 10 years. Games like Killing Floor, Damnation, and Red Orchestra all have their roots in the Unreal 2004 mod scene. Combine the excess amount of content, the amazing base game, and ""god-like"" AI (which helps since the multiplayer community is very small now) and you get the best first person shooter I have ever played.

Remember when games, back in the days, let you customize your matches/lobbies any way you wanted and included AI bots that are not only smart, but also challenging? Pepperidge farm remembers!Regardless of its age, Unreal Tournament 2004 (a.k.a. UT2004) still remains one of the greatest and most competitive FPS games of all time (along with the other entries in the series). Still works well on modern systems without any tweaking necessary.+ UT2004 is a fast-paced and chaotic game where accuracy and awareness are the main requisite to ""frag like it's 1999"", also thanks to a wide range of guns that are different from each other and have both primary and secondary firing modes.+ The 2004 edition is an UT game at its core while still adding many new features and gamemodes, for example Onslaught, which gives the game a ""Battlefield 2"" approach with vehicular combat and nodes to capture on huge maps. The old Assault gamemode from the first game in the series has also been improved thanks to less linear levels and vehicles.+ While the vanilla game has lots of content and variety on its own, the still-active modding community offers so much more (for example, important mods to mention which have then turned into stand-alone games like the wave-based Killing Floor and WW2 shooter Red Orchestra).+ This game is multiplayer-centered. You can host listen servers with port forwarding required if you want to play with friends, or host dedicated ones, but even offline it offers a great experience: bots are human-like, they work on all gamemodes and you can choose from many difficulty options for them, along with more customization options.Well worth the purchase, wether you're an online or offline player!

												This game is often called the ""last hardcore arena shooter"".Epic refined the arena FPS action pioneered by the Quake series and the original Unreal Tournament.There are few games I have enjoyed more than this one. All of the gamemodes from deathmatch to CTF to Bombing Run to Assault require a different skillset than most gamers are used to. This game was ahead of its time.The music is absolutely phenomenal, as is expected of the Unreal series. I listen to it even when I'm not playing the game.Somebody had an interesting metaphor that I will use: in the FPS genre, Wolfenstein 3D was the wheel, Doom was the horse drawn carriage, Quake was the combustion engine, and Half-Life was the Ford Model T. In my opinion, UT99 was the Ferrari 458 or the Noble M600.Which makes this game about the equivelant of an F-22 Raptor.However, there is one thing that I wish this game had,The weapon with which I defeated Xan Kriegor in the original Unreal TournamentThe RipperRIP the RipperBut Hey: at least the Lightning Gun is fun.And my second favorite weapon, the shock rifle, is still here. Please, Epic: make the new Unreal Tournament more like this.10/10 would try turning the safety off again.			"

												The Unreal Engine 2 may look dated but you will have a good time with this than you will in say, Unreal Tournament 3. Even after a decade after it's release, the modding community is still around as well as the multiplaer. If you're going to buy this game, go get some custom maps, skins, characters, and etc. because you will get more enjoyment out of this game. Even if there is no online match to join, you can fight against the bots that almost feel like you're actually on a server!			"

												The way to success lies through failures, and only those who doesn't fear critics, will master this road. Unreal Tournament 2004 — not simply doubled number of the cards, new textures, game modes and tons of pleasant trifles. It is attempt to grope the style lost in motley UT 2003 tinsel and to get back to the ideas which in due time have made the best-seller the first UT; fruit of two years' evolution, thoughtful studying of responses and careful introduction of new concepts. Certainly, about any aspiration to start everything with a clean slate the speech doesn't go — UT 2004 at least on two thirds consists of old materials. Well familiar modes are attached to thoroughly propatchenny frame of the previous version — дефматч usual, дефматч command, CTF, Double Domination, Last Man Standing and Bombing Run, and 50 of 106 available cards already ""stayed"" in UT 2003 and free a bonus-pakakh from Epic/Digital Extremes. Copied them not blindly — the levels which design caused special complaints, are changed or processed, and the balance of forces got rid of lameness. So, the spring ability of players decreased and ""adrenalinic tablets"" fell in price, adding now on only two units ""is flown into a rage"". But after all game should be tried, I advise all! (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours).			"

												The 26.6 hours on my account is only a fraction of the time I've spent playing unreal tournament 2004.I had a physical copy on release, and the game of the year edition as well.I must of clocked in 1000's of hours in this game in my life.This game is so much more than when you get in the box.And what you get right out of the box is,10 game modes.Vehicles.Mutators and built in game mods.over 100 maps.17 weapons, all with a secondary fire.32 character models.That right there is the content of 10 triple A titles released today, followed by years of shoddy paid dlc, all in one game on release.They literally don't make them like this anymore.The game itself has a wide community of modders, and even though most have moved on at this point, the mods still exist for download on many websites.This is the game that incepted Killing Floor, Red Orchestra, and Alien swarm, all of which used to be conversions of UT2004, which you can still download the originals of course.The gameplay is tight and still holds up today with the wall jumping, corner skiing, sliding, rocket jumps, ect.

												My favourite iteration of the UT series.Vanilla UT2004 has more than enough game mods and maps to swallow up huge amounts of your time. The bots cater for every skill level and do a good job of making offline matches fun in their own right. It also has a campaign mode that lets you buy and sell players, challening other clans to matches as you head on up the league table. It was very enjoyable back in the day and I was sad When UT3 didn't have the same sort of campaign.The game will run smoothly on all but the most basic of computers and has been a staple of LAN parties ever since its launch. It has aged brilliantly and was well supported by its community back in the day, making it worth getting for mods like 'Air Buccaneers' alone!Before UT2004 there was a 2003 edition which was very similar. There was outcry when this version was announced, with people accusing it of becoming an annual series, much like EA sport titles. I'm almost sad that that wasn't the case, since this 2004 version contains everything that came with the 2003 edition, doubled the number of maps, added new game modes (including a very popular vehicle mode which is better balanced than I had ever expected it to be) and generally rendered the previous version of the game obsolete.I still haven't scratched the surface of what this game contains. It's big enough that even if you only like a small fraction of what it has to offer, you'll still have more to play with than most entire games have to offer. An odd little side-note, but both girls I've shown this game to have loved it, even though they're not generally fans of aggressive, adrenaline-based frag fests. Odd.It's a thumbs up from me. The only irritating thing about it is that occasionally matches reach a frustrating stalemate, or you begin to lose through no fault of your own which is an incredibly frustrating experience. You'd expect that in online modes but offline, when you're outperforming the bots by a considerable margin, can get very frustrating. I've hardly touched the online part of this game, it's never appealed to me. Call me a noob, but the fact this game still holds my attention should pay adequate testament to the quality of this title. UT2004: 10 games rolled into one. Fun for all the family. 'cept children, probably not suitable for them. "

												UT2k4 is a legendary multiplayer FPS that made Epic more then a studio that made the engine Deus Ex ran on. It featured fast paced deathmatch and amazing balance with it's weapons. What made UT2k4 also legendary was it's bot AI, which remains unprecidented in intelligence. It mimics the movements of actual players and unless your a software programmer feels totally unpredictable.UT2k4 also had a very large modding community and games like Red Orchestra and Killing Floor were mods for this game. Truly a delight to play and reminds me of a nice Saturday afternoon.			"

												When it comes to mind-less FPS violence, I can’t believe people would rather play mediocre games such as CoD when they could just go with legendary classics such as this game. I’m a huge fan of this game, I’ve played it for YEARS, I’ve even been on tournaments of this game and even won two of those. However, I’m gonna try to leave that aside and give you a proper review of why you should or not buy this game, and as usual I will start with the negative parts of it. ...Or I would if this game had much negative stuff. Really, the only negative stuff I can think off have to be Assault maps, as they deviate too much from the other game-modes, and vehicle based maps can be a little weird at times. And maybe that it's multiplayer community isn't that full of people after more than 10 years after release. That’s it!Instead, what does this game have that it’s good?First and foremost, the AI. It’s good. It’s really f#cking good. In fact I’m an expert at bugging and breaking games, and rarely I’ve found the AI breaking and falling apart. The game also has the option to put a random difficulty mode and then analyze how well you do against it, then constantly change it so it’s all up to your skill level, something that I don’t think I’ve seen in other games and should be in most of them.Going right up to that are the maps. Not even one of them feels the same as others, only a few of them grow a bit stale because of them being too big or too small and sh#t like that. The game also has maps from previous games that are memorable, such as Facing Worlds, which is the De_Dust of Unreal Tournament, and even adding remakes and different versions of them.Another big-#ss point in favor of the game has to be the soundtrack. I ain’t f#cking arround when I say, IT’S REALLY F#CKING GOOD. The devs knew what they needed to make the action feel even more intense, and succeeded immensely. The gameplay itself is also kind of a master-piece, a one of it’s kind in FPS games. All guns (except the ones to start with) are useful in their own way and have their own flair to themselves. They all have their own ways of being used and are all fun to waste people with, although some need more aim than others, such as the Lightning-Gun/Sniper Rifle and Shock Rifle. And hell, any game that has an Anti-Air weapon turned into a shotgun with a grenade launcher option has to be a great game on paper.Something that’s also rather unique to this kind of game are the sprees, and the game announcer on it’s own. You know how in these modern fps crap games you get rewards for killing multiple people on a single life? Well f#ck that, here instead you get to hear insane voice clips from the announcer not believing how could you just do what to a human being. From the classic “KILLING SPREE!” to the infamous “HOLY ♥♥♥♥!”, they’re all memorable. Also, the game keeps track of what you do in a match, and hitting F3 will show you information about it, such as how sh#t your aim is or how many sprees you got in that match.All and all, is this game worth it?  Did you even pay any attention? Of course it is. It’s WAY superior to the sequel it got later on, which kinda sucked, and it has really good mod support. Infact, games such as Red Orchestra and Killing Floor started as mods for Unreal Tournament 2004, it’s that good. I seriously recommend it to any FPS fan out there who just wants to chill out and have fun murdering anything that f#cking moves. And if you want, install the Bloddy Hell mod, which makes, between a ton of other crap, blood and gore more sadistic and makes it stay on the map forever if you feel so, which is BLODDY F#CKING GREAT. TL;DR Edition: A classic FPS that never seems to age. F#cking good and cheap. If you like FPS and you don’t have it, you have serious issues either in your brain or your wallet.			"

												UT2004 is one of the best games ever.   Onslaught, Invasion, and even standard DM are all quite fun.  One of the very best things about the game that keeps it fresh today are all the great maps, characters, mutators and mods that you can use.  All 100% FREE. User made DLC is the best.Want to go racing?  There's a mod for that.  Have more than 30 weapons at your disposal?  Mod for that too.  Play a creepy survival horror game?  There's even a mod for that.  Fight hordes of monsters, level up, and use awesome RPG skills?  Mod for that.  The possibilities are almost limitless.  It's a fun single-player experience, but where it really shines is multiplayer.  Even after 10 years there are plenty of servers for most popular gametypes.			"

												IF YOU AREN'T PLAYING UNREAL TOURNAMENT, YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED VIDEO GAMES. IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED VIDEO GAMES, GO GET A LIFE!(BEFORE STARTING OFF : if you are experiencing troubles regarding your screen moving without you touching it, you're going to have to uncheck the following : mouse smoothing, reduce mouse lag and enable joystick. I haven't figured out yet how to play with a controller).All honesty though, this game has come quite the way from it's original conception. Back in the day Unreal was an amazing shooter and still to this day still holds highly to it's acclaim. The mods have helped significantly to keep the game interesting. Unreal Tournament is most likely known for it's obscene commentary, extreme gore, and weapons that aliens look like they developed. Before you start playing multiplayer, there is a campaign available that will get you ready for multiplayer. In UT, you may customize your character from a large select group of races in which each have their own attributes. The guns in this game are absolutely fantastic. They range from basic shotgun and rockets to energy weapons that will vaporize an opponent. I should say the guns are one of the main reasons why this game got so big; the fact they also introduced alternative firing with both the same amount of strength really plays to the shooters advantage. The game play itself compared to other shoots is a little fast as players move throughout the map with speed. Movement/controls is quite basic but includes sprinting, crouching, jumping, lateral movements and double tapping a movement button will make the player roll forward. Like Halo, you won't find many players standing still to take a shot as you are absolutely vulnerable when not in motion. What blew my mind was one map I played online where I was not only able to enjoy the basics the game came with, but some crazy yahoo out there took his time to make vehicles (that resemble warthogs), ghost sort of looking vehicles that can jump vertically up and down, tanks and of course a ship that flies through the air. The mods get pretty crazy and some maps feature fixed guns. Game modes that are available in this game are standard deathMatch, team deathMatch, capture the flag and double domination (which is sort of like King of the Hill). Upon killing a lot of opponents or collecting adrenaline, players can use it for regeneration (Down, Down, Down, Down), invisibility (Right, Right, Left, Left), faster rate of fire (Up, Up, Down, Down) and faster movement speed (Up, Up, Up, Up) - (pint size and berserk are also available but I do not know the proper combos... yet). This adds an extra depth to already an enjoyable game. Picking up more health, armor or even ammo is quite easy and shouldn't be too much of an issue to get the gun you want. It's how much can you dodge while you're getting there. I should also add the maps I've come across so far have been superb.The visuals are as good as they can be for their age and an update to them could make or break the game. It's vintage-ness is what's really appreciated. Sounds are pretty good, although basic and not extremely varied but provide a good context for the gun you're firing. I would absolutely recommend this game on sale to anyone. It is simply a fun FPS that can be enjoyed by anyone. You will quickly see some players that have really taken their time to precise their movements and their shooting patterns.RATING : rock solid 8/10Gameplay B+ Story / Campaign C+ Visuals / User Interface C+ Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability B- Overall  B-ScreenShots :  Looks almost nothing like it Using a link gun to disable an air unit  "

												There's no question about it. Unreal Tournament 2004 is simply the greatest multiplayer FPS of all time. Back when I first got this game in 2004, I played nothing else but this for 3 whole years. It was just that great. The community was booming, and new mods and levels were being released each day. The gameplay is the perfect blend of fast-paced action and strategic map control, something that no modern shooter has ever been able to replicate.And guess what? Even with the game nearing the 10-year mark, it's still active! You can still find some Deathmatch and Onslaught servers with a steady community if you decide to start playing right now. A true testament to the absolute quality of this game.It's unfortunate that UT3 failed to capture this game's success, and that Epic has pretty much abandoned this series in favor of Gears of War, but for any big-time multiplayer FPS fan out there, this is a must-own.

												Adds to what made the first Unreal Tournament a masterpiece.Based mostly on the GOG.com (DRM-free) version and Unreal Anthology (DVD ROM).When making a sequel to the much venerated Unreal Tournament (1999) you better damn well get it right. Fortunately for both Epic and UT fans, Unreal Tournament 2004 does precisely that. Taking the misteps out of Unreal Tournament 2003 and adding some cool new features paid off in spades for Epic and UT fans.This time around, UT looks dazzling - even in 2017. Deathmath, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Dominiation, and Assault all make comebacks. Domination has a noticable difference in that teams must control TWO check points simultaneously for a few seconds as opposed to multiple check points at any given time. Added to the modes is Onslaught, which involves controling nodes until the opposing team's core is exposed. Both Assault and Onslaught now utilize huge environments and...VEHICLES. Removed is the option to have four teams at once (R/B/G/Y) in TDM and DOM. From the obvious graphical enhancement, which has aged quite well, to the varied gameplay, UT2004 delivers.While Unreal Tournament 99/GOTY is my all-time fave FPS, UT2004 slides in right behind it for some damn good reasons.For those wondering where UT2003 went: it's all in UT2004, minus some parts that put fans off. In fact, there's a Mutator that allows for using the UT2003 HUD. So UT2003 is in UT2004.			"

												DISCLAIMER: If anyone notices I left out UT2003 completely, there's a point to that, and that point is likely parallel to why it only took a single year for another UT to come out.What can I say about this game? The Steam hours say nothing about how much time I've actually put into this game. I first bought it a day after it was released in Canada (That would be about 4 weeks after it was released in the US, based on exchange rates at the time), which would have been when I was 15 or 16 years old. I'm nearly 27 now, and I still hold many fond memories with this game, and will continue to make great memories. It doesn't often see a lot of replay, but the once or twice a year I do jump back into it, I stick to it for at LEAST a week before moving on. That says a lot for an 11 year old game. A lot of other games that age I just can't jump back into because it's just too outdated for me. That, or I've grown up enough to realize that the game actually sucks balls.UT2004 is an FPS, and like the name says, you're in a Tournament setting. You get points for ""frags"" (kills), capturing flags, holding positions, or whatever else depending on game type. The game is won when either team, or individual player in Deathmatch, reaches a certain goal parameter set by the campaign, yourself in Instant Action, or the Servermaster in Multiplayer. For example, in a Team Deathmatch game, the goal is always going to be the team with the most points collectively. This can be either a set limit, or it can be a timer countdown in which the team with the most frags at the end of the timer wins. The best part of this game, though, is HOW you get your frags. Even in the vanilla game, there are at least a dozen weapons to choose from. For the most part, these weapons are ranged, but there are one or two melee weapons (Who wants to use those, though?). I don't want to spoil the fun for those who are new to the game, so I'll tell you about my favourite: The flak cannon. This weapon was in the original Unreal Tournament, as well, and in it's return, it's packing a meaner punch. Here's what it does: The primary fire throws a dozen or more slugs of white-hot shrapnel at fast speed, ripping your oponent to shreds. Use this fire up close, and like a shotgun, you're bound to make it messy. The secondary fire is more of a mortar, in which the shrapnel is launched still encased, and then explodes into shrapnel on impact. Imagine taking that out in Call of Duty. I have to be super honest, I've never actually fully completed the actual TOURNAMENT (The ""campaign"" of the game), but I was never really looking for that when I bought the game. I had spent the previous five years playing Unreal Tournament, and 99.2% of that time was playing Practice Sessions, or in the case of UT2004, Instant Action. This is, in my opinion, the Brains of the game. Instant Action is where all the experimentation unfolded. Anything that you downloaded or created yourself was first tested in Instant Action, where it was put to the test with or against computer AI bots. The bots in this game are incredibily intelligent, and also very customizable. To find out more, and there's a LOT more about Instant Action, play the game and experiment yourself. It won't ever get old.When it comes to modability, that's where UT is the most memorable. You get the basic package, which is amazing on it's own and has hundreds of hours of gameplay, but then you also get FULL modability of the game. They even include a full UTEditor where ANYONE can jump in and make maps, good or bad, mods, skins, sounds, graphics, textures, ANYTHING. It's one of the most awesome things I've seen when it comes to a game. And then those who aren't so good with game editing could easily just check community hubs and sites for content. This was what DLC was before it was corporatized and had a price slapped on it for good measure. This is how it still SHOULD be, and I'm glad Steam came up with the workshop. I'm happy there are still a lot of good developers who provide open modability, as well. I just don't see it in this scope anymore. UTEditor was relatively simple (For those who are into it) and basically right there for you to curiously click on and figure out. To put it in perspective, I was creating maps and doing minor mods to UT99 when I was 12. That's about all I can muster for UT2004 right now. There's WAY too much to really rave about, and I don't want to talk circles around anyone. HIGHLY recommend this game. 9.5/10			"

												UT2004 is absolutely amazing. So much content and it can still be increased by an enormous amount for free by the community! There are a plethora of maps, characters, modes, weapons, vehicles and it all seemlessly works coherently together without feeling too over powered and out of place. Plenty of action offline or LAN with mates (and the online community is still there!). The game has been around for a while and yet is still good to go back to. Music is good and so are the sound effects as well as those dodgy one liners from the original UT plus new ones. The game is very moddable and easy to use to install mods. Still prefer this version to UT2003, UT3 and in many regards more than UT1999 (the original!). Let's Rock!			"

Pick from one of many weapons to choose from, Rocket Launcher, Lightning Gun, Machine Gun, even a gun that shoots acidic balls that'll melt you into goo! Each with a primary and secondary function. Pick up Health items and Armor items to give you the edge in battle against other opponents. This game does require lightning fast reflexes to be above the competition.

I always liked getting blown apart at multiplayer matches, it was so fun to watch the madness of the gameplay. You really gotta try it. You'll obviously have a good and bad time playing this cause it's not that easy to master all the weapons, but it's really fun to get attached to one and play along.

												Fantastic game. Fast-paced, fun, requires skill, accuracy, a bit of thought, quick reflexes, and the ability to actually move around properly.Dodge, wall-jump, and double-jump mechanics allow you to combine these in any order. They allow you to move quickly and be all over the place, making yourself hard to hit, and allow you to get across the map faster.There are a multitude of weapons to be picked up off of the map, all of which are unique and have their own special functions, and alternate firing modes.Hundreds of maps, most with great art-style, environments, geographical design, and music.Being a game from 2004, the game still looks fantastic (better than many games today, unsurprisingly), and has a multitude of great bonus features.-Press F11 and the game opens a built-in in-game music player that allows you to play any of your own, or in-game songs, instead of what the current map is playing.-In the audio options, there is a feature that enables built-in text-to-speech for the chat and IRC areas of the game, that way you don't miss a word as your head spins on a swivel, while you are caught up in the fast-paced shooting and battles, with no time to read.There's a ton of game modes, Deathmatch, Bombing Run, Double Domination, Assault, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Vehicle Capture the Flag, Onslaught, and many others.Get the game, play against bots (start off on just below masterful, trust me. Just BELOW Masfterful), and have some fun. Instant action and campaign, once you find a decent community, play some online. Do NOT play sniper camping, zark (especially), or ballistic weapons mods exclusively (24/7, or primarily). Also do NOT play DM-Rankin all the time.SUPPORT the servers that don't suck balls and have ACTUAL map rotation!			"

												It's one of those games you probably kenw as a kid, and might being one of your childhood games you have ever played on the PC. Ever since I figured out how to mod the game after so many years, I have grew attached to the game with awesome mods, like character modles, new game modes, and online gameplay is still avaible! It shows how EPIC games are dedicated to their servers, unlike some old games with online game, who discontinued the online services. I totally recommend this game to anyone who wants to enjoy the game, mod the hell out of it and have more fun then it being vanilla. Have fun wth this, gamers!			"

A shiny trophy.  It's got awesome competitive gamemodes, a huge list of taunts, awesome vehicles, maps  where you use nothing but jets, flying around, completing objectives,  awesome weapons (Don't forget to mention Ballistic Weapons, amazing mod), unforgettable maps, and so much more.If only there was a graphic mod...9.5/10-0.5 for graphics, but it's not really the games' fault, it was 2004.

Now you can, because Unreal Tournament 2004 has literally thousands of downloadable player skins and models you can find online.Even the stock game has a staggering 6gb of content. Lots of awesome maps, dozens of game modes, a single player campaign, custom solo skirmishes, and much more. The re-playability of UT2004 is endless.Lastly, If you like Unreal Tournament '99, there's even more reason to buy and play this game, as there's now a very faithful adaptation of UT99 for UT2004 known as Unreal Tournament: 2341 - http://www.moddb.com/mods/ut2341-hd-arsenal "

												I spent many hours playing UT2004 (& 2003) back in college.  My roommates and I would set up a LAN in our house, which common at the time.  Besides becoming a ""standard"" for arena shooters, this game offers a variety of other game modes, which can be played MP or SP, like team DM, assault, bombing run, double domination, CTF, etc. Playing against the bots is not to be taken lightly...UT games have always had solid AI, which can be set at different skill levels.The graphics were amazing at the time the game was released, and are still decent today.  There are a ton of stock maps. Presently, there is still a small online community, and you can always find at least a few matches. Great game.			"

I had over 5k hours and maybe more which wasn't counted on my xfire and other accounts back in the day. I remember my tournament days before esports became popular playing this game, and being called a bot when I had 100% weapon accurancy, that I knew I played the game way to much, but I don't regret it. It's awesome and worth getting! The fast paced action always kept me coming back to play over and over again, especially deathmatch and team arena. Plus there are many mods, maps, and more, you'll have plenty to enjoy with random people or close friends. So add this to your collection of fps! ^_^			"

												Played the Unreal series since 99. No moddern FPS can even compare to this: the Michelangelo of games. At the time, I'd also played Quake, Doom, and CS. But Unreal....oh my, Unreal. My first true love. She snuffed out all others like candles in the rain.Every gamer has that one game that just consumes them. Their pulse quickens and their eyes plaster to the screen, your very soul trapped in an enigma of endless time. Years pass as you watch you life fly by at 60 HZ. Your wrists build strong lasting muscle and hardened tendons from hammering on the WASD keys for hours on end. Your index and middle fingers become your future wifes dream toys as you hone your dexterity with years of mousebutton rappid firing. Your heart races as you shotgun dance with your enemies states and countries apart.This game....This game needs no introduction. It's name is simple and rightfully fitting: Unreal.In it's prime, there were thousands of servers on Game Spy. Close your eyes and point, you'd find one packed with dozens of players from all over the globe. My personal favorite was Instagib (one shot kills). CTF, or TDM. I played in a clan that utilized a player built map system called ""giant maps"". They were maps that looked like your living room, kitchen, dining room, dorm room, bathroom, etc... but you were the size of a penny. 20 guys buzzing around looking like red or blue dots againt a refridgerator or television. ""BigPapa290"" is strafing on the floor by the door stop, dodging lasers from an onslaught of enemies flying over the cookie jar. Your clan noob ""SparklesTheElephant"" is straight walking along the bathroom tiles, still figuring out the controls and somehow lands some lucky shot on your enemies veteran ""X-L4X69"" who's stalking him from the toilet paper dispenser. ""DarkCarnage49"" is camped up on the shelf by the fabric softener sniping guys off by the furnace pilot light, but ""DeepDishPizza"" teleports up from the floor in some crazy zig-zag pattern and an epic battle ensues as they jump and double jump and spin back and fourth until one lands a shot. Then, somehow you've found your way into the clothes dryer drum where there is no wall and everywhere is a mirror. There's no telling which way is out. ""HabaneroFarts"" has also stumbled upon this trap! Son of a B****! In a fury, you start firing at ghosts. Did I hit him? No, that was his reflection. Why isn't he dead?! How the F*** do I get out of this hell!So you just stand still, hopefully he can just end your misery and you can just die and spawn in the kitty litter box like you were hoping for to begin with.GREAT SCOTT! the memories :)I really doubt you could find games in Unreal that are like this today, but nevertheless, all other game modes are just as fun. This game, is one of 2 game that gets my full 10/10. It consumed my life, man. And I loved every minute of it.			"

												Take everything that was great about the original Unreal Tournament, upgrade the graphics, throw in physics, and toss in lots of maps, game modes, weapons, and even vehicles, and you have Unreal Tournament 2004. It's one of the best multiplayer shooters around, even today, and the singleplayer is surprisingly challenging (the bots are competent and even as good as real players!). Not only that, but there's a plethora of great mods available for it. Well worth grabbing for any UT or online shooter fan.			"

												This is what a competitve shooter should be. A great game at high level skill but simple enough for casual players to join in. The surviving game modes currently are Deathmatch, CTF, and Onslaught. Onslaught is a good start for players, it does not requrie as much attention as CTF or Deathmatch; it's comparable to Titan mode in BF2142 where you have to destroy the other team's main point. There are a large ammount of weapons in this game, each with there own unique use. Most guns have a secondary fire, ifnot they use a zoom function.The movement system is something that will be missed in FPS games. You have your simple Jumps and Double jumps, but then you have dodges and wall dodges. They're like a far reaching side jump, so when your about to get hit you can quickly move off to side into safety (or impending danger) faster than you would have jumping. Since you are unable to rocket jump, shield guns are used as a subsitute. The shield gun's primary can be charged up to deal a damaging wave of force in front of you to kill people who get to close or push up just a bit higher. The longer the charge the higher you can go up, but the more you get hurt.The game is pretty much dead but if you have friends i absolutley reccomend this game, it's an experience you won't get from other shooters made today (mabey other the Quake, and Warsow)			"

												The best game of all time!Why? Because, there is a lasting desire to play this game even after having played it pretty much since it came out. I can't resist the challange, the multiplayercommunity is still active and keeps bringing me back every single day.Back in time this game was the first in an era of game-engines where you could walk, drive and fly with a perfect experience and control. The learning curve to master weapons, movement, the surrounding and your opponent is endless. Totally different than any regurlar shooter like CS, BF or COD which are far less rich on dynamic and have a far less joy factor.The best that this game offers is a game-editor. Make your own custimazations or download them as there is an extreme amount of wide-ranged mods available for both off and online play. The community enriched the game with content, a reason for them to love this game and a reason for them to keep playing this game. I wonder why new games don't offer such a thing as this concept has proven itself in extreme over time.The graphics are extreme good for a game that is 10 years old. You can easily select a high resolution without seeing pixels. Maps have been designed on arena playability, not pure as a show off for the engine possibilities.The sound is awesome as UT2004 is a game that supports digital audio. Windows XP supports digital sound, Vista and 7 do not. Windows made a recent move with Windows 8 by supporting digital sound again. Want to experience digital gamingsound yourself? You like to experience yourself why early PC gamers start watering in their mouth of digital gamesound?The game runs flawless on any Windows version that runs Steam. Just make sure to check the guide for Windows 10.

It has a good variety of the weapons, and every gun seems to have a alt fire that compliments the gun nicely. Same with vehicles. It has a giant viaration of levels and gametypes, and you are free to download maps that other uses have made.			"

												Taking everything that was good about UT2003 and stepping it up a notch. UT2004 is one of the best competitive shooters out there today. The game is STUNNINGLY optimized for PC and achieves a steller amount of options for your unique gaming experience (somehow though, they forgot widescreen... but a quick look on the forums will change that). Unreal has never felt so true to a warrior's spirit before. With weapons of destruction, deadly one liners, advanced A.I, and so much more, UT2004 seems to have thought of it all. It's no wonder there was no UT2005! When it comes to a game such as this, I find myself lost for words as it's more of an experience you'll need to experience yourself. I can't explain to you how fun it is to bungee jump, you'll have to go and try it yourself to truly find out, and that's how I feel about UT2004. Seriously, you can NOT pass this masterpiece up.10/10 - Pure Excellence at It's Best!			"

												UT2004 is 10 years old now, and it shows in its graphics, but it still plays as slick as ever. Given that it is so old now, it should run great on just about any computer you throw it at. It works fine on my Windows 7 64-bit machine too, although I did have to tweak my ut2004.ini file to make it run in 1080p as the highest resolution it offers out of the box is 1680x1050.The player population is a lot smaller now than when this game was in its heyday, but still out there. Playing it now (May 2014) brings back lots of good memories of when I first played it when I was in college back in 2004. Onslaught is still my favorite game mode! Beware though, it seems that almost everyone still playing has been for years and they will kick your ♥♥♥!			"

												Sadly very few players online, a shame, but that's not surprising due to its age. Still a good game for old times sake. So Yes: But recommended only because you should have this in your steam library just to remind yourself now and again how far games have changed, both for better and worse, in the last decade. You won't get much multiplayer action from it these days.			"

												Every game comes with its positives and negatives. That being said, I think this game is one of the greatest games made to date! I absolutely love it! Epic Games and their engine really did create what I'd consider a masterpiece that is UT2k4. Originally, I got introduced to the Unreal series through the predecessor UT2k3 when I was just a little kid and I almost instantly fell in love with the game. My family was fairly poor at the time, so they could never afford to buy me the game, so I had to get a pirated copy to play. Once 2k4 came out, I loved the even greater variety of game modes that it had to offer as well as the old game modes that were only offered in UT99 at the time. As soon as I started working and made a steam account, I bought Unreal Tournament 2004 because I really do think it's well worth its price. Heck, I even bought it for a few of my close friends for them to play too just because the Unreal series NEEDS to be known, or at least I think it should be. I'll start out with the positives and the things I love about this game.Positives:- Multiple multiplayer game modes- Very different difficulty levels of AI's that do test your skill well, or can help you learn easily- Generally strong, polite, dedicated community (I've met moderators of maps that still hang around ever since the game launched!)- Immersive and very well balanced gameplay- Fast paced- Challenging (In all honesty, I think this game truly tests your weapon handling skills in terms of shooter games)- Fun community game mods and a very well done game editing kit- Competitive- Satisfying gameplay- Many gaming and option features- Character design is fresh and different, many maps to play on, and large gun variety (as well as some sweet vehicles too!)Negatives:- Arena shooters aren't as popular as they used to be- Graphics are outdated (Who cares?)- The rare but occasional hackerHonestly, for me, the negatives don't even hold a candle to the overall game and my rating for it is an easy 10/10That being said, if you want to test your shooting, dodging, reaction time and/or any other skills I highly recommend this game!

												What's not to like, it's UT2004. This game mastered the arena shooter genre and the UT series continues to dominate with no competition to this day. The fast paced gameplay, the weapons (especially the Shock Rifle and Flak Cannon), the nostalgia, everything about this game is amazing. It was in 2004 and still is 10 years later. I think it's fair to say that anyone who loves Unreal, or arena shooters in general, loves this game. And will continue to for a long time to come.			"

												It's sad that I'm old enough to call this game 'classic' but it indeed is a classic showpiece of the further development of not only the Unreal series, but the general state of FPS games at the time. A good way to relive the gaming days of the era, this game is not only full of fun and strategy, but a good buy to enjoy with friends and family. It's not expensive as it once was, and would make a decent holiday gift if you wanted to buy a few copies to share, and enjoy together. Isn't that what the holidays are about? maiming, slashing, and killing as a family?			"

												Temos aqui o terceiro (em ordem cronológica) título da série Unreal lançado no Steam. Lançado em 2004 e que teve o Unreal Engine 2.5 como base. Um FPS frenético onde tiros de metralhadoras, foguetes, plasma e ogivas nucleares vão garantir que você não saia vivo. Agora temos a presença de veículos, mais classes e novos modos de jogo para garantir a diversão por muitas e muitas horas.Avaliação:Classes/Raças: 9/10Temos poucas opções de customização de personagens, nada além de opções de rosto e cor das vestimentas, porém porém isso é mais que suficiente pois na maioria das vezes os corpos simplesmente explodem no meio da partida. Apesar disso, temos cerca de 11 raças para escolher. Não faz muita diferença, pois o importante é destruir o adversário antes que ele te destrua.Modos de jogo: 10/10Unreal Tournament 2004 traz diversos modos de jogo. Muitas horas garantidas e muita variedade para todos os gostos. Estes são alguns dos modos de jogo disponíveis:  -Onslaught: Neste modo de jogo a grande jogada é o uso de veículos, e você precisa destruir todas as bases inimigas para capturá-las em link, todas elas espalhadas em um mapa enorme. Capture todas as bases para ter acesso ao Power Core da equipe inimiga, e destruí-lo. Há grandes conflitos concentrados em bases-chave.  -Bombing Run: Uma espécie de futebol assassino. Você tem que pegar a bola que está no meio do mapa e atirá-la no arco (gol) inimigo. Arremessando a bola você faz 3 pontos, pulando junto com ela você faz 7 pontos. A bola pode ser passada aos aliados, e é derrubada se você for morto.  -Capture the Flag: Este clássico ainda está presente. Faça pontos capturando a bandeira inimiga e levando-a até a sua.  -Double Domination: Seu time faz pontos ao capturar os 2 pontos de controle e mantê-los por 10 segundos. Cada ponto fica em um lado do mapa.  -Mutant: Uma partida Deathmatch comum, e o primeiro a morrer se torna o ""mutant"". Este jogador recebe munição ilimitada, camuflagem e super-velocidade, mas perde saúde com o tempo. Quando o ""mutant"" é morto, os poderes dele passam para quem o matou.Música: 9/10A trilha sonora do jogo é interessante, se diferencia um pouco do estilo das músicas de seu antecessor, mas continua sendo bem ""animada"". Ideal para um jogo frenético como este.Gráficos: 10/10Belos gráficos, muito melhorados se comparados ao Unreal Tournament anterior, agora temos mapas em vastas florestas, cavernas subterrâneas, naves espaciais, mapas submersos e até mesmo do lado de fora de naves no espaço!Controles: 10/10Os mesmos controles de um FPS comum. Algo que pode ser difícil no começo é o sistema de esquiva (apertar duas vezes rapidamente para alguma direção faz seu personagem ""desviar"" para aquele lado. O que também pode fazer um novo jogador se confundir são os atalhos para as armas, pois temos um total de 19 armas!Arsenal: 10/10Ah, o arsenal de UT2004 continua sendo letal e variado. Dentre as mais interessantes temos:O Translocador, que te permite atirar um disco em qualquer lugar do mapa e se teletransportar para o local onde o disco está;O Bio Rifle, que atira placas de lixo tóxico que grudam nas paredes e na superfície da água;A Link Gun, um rifle que atira rajadas de plasma quente ou uma rajada contínua do mesmo;O Flak Cannon, uma arma que atira estilhaços quente de metal nos inimigos, que ricocheteiam nas paredes;O Rocket Launcher, dispensa comentários, lançador de foguetes que também pode lançá-los em forma de granadas temporizadas. É possível soltar até 3 foguetes ao mesmo tempo;Redeemer, a arma mais poderosa do jogo. Lança uma ogiva nuclear com imensa área de impacto, o que garante diversos Multi-Kills. No tiro secundário, é possível controlar a ogiva com uma câmera. Apesar do poder de fogo, a Redeemer só pode carregar 1 ogiva por vez.Servidores: 8/10Temos diversos servidores com a grande maioria dos modos de jogo disponíveis ao redor do mundo, sendo assim o lag pode ser algo a atrapalhar, ainda mais num jogo com ritmo frenético como este. Apesar disso, o Single Player ainda pode ser um grande desafio nos modos de dificuldade mais avançados.Nota final: 9.4/10A série Unreal Tournament foi (e ainda é) um dos grandes pilares dos FPS, ao lado de jogos como Quake e Counter-Strike. É um FPS especialmente interessante para se jogar, pois proporciona uma experiência bem diferente da que outros jogos de tiro podem te dar. Vale muito a pena.			"

												Another Unreal game that, for its time, was understated yet an innovation in technology, graphics and perhaps gaming AI. In retrospect, after hours of gaming on my old laptop, is the sort of game that you'd end up playing in phases, rather than throwing to dust after so long. This introduced me to gaming, and is worthy of so much more than it has been given. The new options added on from UT2003 have been spectacular, but perhaps have damaged the first-person shooter theme of it with the introduction of vehicles. Its successor, UT3, has considered this point well, but nonetheless fails to uphold the options on this game, with team selection and game controls. Despite some minor loopholes that emerge, it would still not be deservingly praised with a 'Game of the Decade' title.			"

												Classic!My dad brought this game back in 2004 when it first came out, and us little nooblets just loved it. My brother and I spent a lot of our younger years playing this game. Although it’s old now and not many people really play it anymore, (The servers are pretty dead) It was pretty fun when it was packed. The single player campaign was fun and the online multiplayer was even better. There were always different mods and maps out that kept the game fresh and fun and it really did last a long time before dying out. It can still be played, mostly with bots, and it’s still fun, it’s just not the same as it was back in 04.There’s a wide variety of characters all with their different stories and backgrounds, and a lot of game types to play.It’s great fun and for me a major classic.

But thankfully this game has an offline mode where you can fight bots (which by yor choice can become really over powered and un killable) and stuff. 10/10 would play this game again.This is my first review so sorry if its not that great.

												Top notch game. it has a fair amount of bugs and flaws but thats kinda what makes it so great. you can download tons of maps and mods/mutators and play them online or offline. this game has a really fun singleplayer mode that can get boring after a little while but meh.The multiplayer is kinda ♥♥♥♥ because theres barely no one on anymore. and for some of us, the servers we can find have really high ping. But thankfully this game has an offline mode where you can fight bots (which by yor choice can become really over powered and un killable) and stuff. 10/10 would play this game again.This is my first review so sorry if its not that great.

												Unlike most modern arena like shooters (i am talking to you overwatch and tf2) where your all the characters have different abilities and weapons this game makes it so everybody is the same and it takes actual skill and map knowledge to show who is the best in a match. There is no stupid abilities that only certain characters can do or any weapon restrictions. This is why i love this game and all other classic arena shooters.			"

												This brings back so many memories... The first actual pc games i played were Unreal Tournament 2003 and Unreal Tournament 2004. These two games got me into pc gaming, not just because of the gratuidous violence or the simple way the game is laid out to you, it was the fact that they have almost endless replay value. Yea, the graphics dont look as good as they did back then but they were never developed for the extreme high definition displays we use today, But they still look amazing, especially since even if you have a lower end gaming rig, you can still play it with graphics maxed out. The fact that Steam only has UT2004 and not UT2003 is a big letdown especially since they are missing a few other Unreal games, but with the supply of mods (if you know where to look and find them) adds even more fun, i didnt know about modding when i first played, so with the user created content floating out around the web...it basicly creates a whole new experiance .The Pro'sLow end rigs should have little trouble if most of the hardware is from the last few years (i even tested it on my old compaq laptop that hated running games and got 30-50 fps on medium to high settings)Nearly unlimited replay valueMultiplayer is still up//LAN//Dedicated server/hosted(pay-to-host)/listen servers(you host as you play)Tons of mod content ranging from skins, voice packs, maps, mutators, gamemodes and more.Includes unreal editor in game files so you can create contentCustom Mappable ControlsSetting to toggle gore for people with weak stomachs or childrenPlenty of weapons and vehicles for all the violent funSingleplayerVoice Chat for those who know how to set it upPower-ups granting damage bonuses, invisibility, and morePlay alone in instant action with bots and manipulate the ai difficulty ranging from a basic dummy ai that can get kills on you occasionally up to the God-Like ai that paints whatever is behind you with your blood (useful for practice)So much more that cant even be describedThe Con'sOften first time startup can be problematic with some higher resolution displays(simple fix by changing certain values in the games config, search google for fix)Mod content can sometimes be hard to find due to some file servers permanently archiving files or hard to understand install instructionsSteam wont allow multiple instances of the game running (For example you open the game and set up a dedicated server, you cant open another instance of the game to play on your dedicated server unless you are smart enough to outsmart steam...hehe im not sharing my secrets..)Some resolutions dont always scale just right when using an HDTV as a monitor (lots of trial and error finding a resolution you are comfortable with)Overall Unreal Tournament 2004 gets a 9 out of 10*hops in scorpion, drives across map running down every enemy player/bot hops out to get in goliath, gets sniped .

												This game and the whole Unreal Tournament series of games are my favourite by far. Unreal Tournament 2004 is just amazing from all corners. It features a wide variety of gametypes to suit any player. This includes, but is not limited to: Assault, Invasion, Mutant, Last man standing, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the flag, Bombing run, Osnlaught and Double domination.There is also a huge amount of mods and addons for this game that can expand the game by adding more gametypes or modifications called mutators that can modify bits and pieces or even large parts of the game making it more fun and interesting. Graphics and performance are both really good for a game so old, getting 100+ FPS with a modern computer is a piece of cake showing it is well optimised. If all the time I spent playing this game was recorded, I would definitely have over 2000 hours of it which shows you how much fun I've had. I definitely recommend this game to any arena shooter fan or anyone who might enjoy the fast-paced action this game brings you. Give this game a try, you won't regret it!			"

												Before there was Killing Floor...Before there was Team Fortress 2...There was this game.Despite how it's aged quite a bit, the graphics still look very impressive for a 2004 game, and just about any old PC (like mine) can play it with very little to no lag at all. The frame rate never dips and the action is still fast paced.PROS:+ Graphics, while dated a bit, still looks good in today's times+ The sounds in this game just scream nostalgia when you look back at classic FPS games+ Controls are very simple and easy to pick upCONS:- None at all that I know ofOverall, this game is flawless, it's nostalgic (in today's times), and it was this game that introduced us to Killing Floor, which started out as a mod for this game that has since become its own standalone title.10/10 - A classic gem that desperately needs people to apprecieate its beauty once more.

For a game released in 2003 to still have servers up and a player base is pretty staggering. I can only vomit rainbows when talking about ut2k4.  Shame the sequel sucked. 10/10			"

												Seven years since the release of Unreal Tournament 2004, and it still stands as a paragon of the FPS genre.  Gameplay is fast and furious, but death is seldom instant, a feat rarely accomplished in today's world of a-bullet-scratched-me-take-cover health regen games.  Health and shields are static, restored only by pickups.  Ammo and weapons must be picked up and are not granted with perks.  Everything from vehicles to weapons to ammo is out in the field and just waiting to be grabbed.  And there is a great variety. UT2004 features instant-hit weapons, slow moving projectiles with fierce power, inaccurate but fierce automatic weapons, continuous-stream energy weapons, sniper rifles, sticky grenade launchers, and even moving, intelligent mines that can be redirected by the player with a laser.It's colorful, enjoyeable, open to modding, and perhaps the single best shooter of the last decade, even if it wasn't the most influential.

												This was an absolute GEM when it first came out. I spent many joyful hours playing Invasion RPG mode in which you desperately try to survive against massively modded waves of enemies. Onslaught was great too, trying to link several nodes together to connect to the enemy base was a fantastic idea. Sadly, with UT3 (which was TERRIBLE) this game doesn't have much of a community anymore.			"

												I have played over 5000 hours in this game since its release. Started off with vehicle Capture The Flag (vCTF) and then moving into the Team Arena Master (TAM) mod. Due to the age of the game, you are unlikely to find a large number of populated servers, however you should be able to find a large number of TAM ones about. The premise of TAM are two teams (5v5 usually) start a round, with a standard set of weapons, with the aim of being the last team standing. First team to get 10 rounds wins. Very simple, but extremely fun.If this game had a playerbase like it did at release, I would still be playing. Keep an eye out on the horizon for UT4.			"

												Even after all these years, UT04 not only holds up both in terms of gameplay, but is actually better than most current offerings. There are 2 main reasons for this: Simple but timeless gameplay, and massive amounts of content. Games like this remind us all of the sad state of the current games industry. This game was released in a era where people expected their games to have content. There was no DLC. And oh boy, does this game have meat on it's bones. Yes it does, with huge amounts of maps, many different game modes, and even a single player tournament mode where you put together a team and fight other teams thus giving a sense of progression in what would otherwise be just a simple arena shooter.  The graphics also actually hold up pretty well. This is largely because the graphic style is a bit cartoonish and very colorful, and thus it doesn't fall into the trap of ""not looking realistic anymore"" like so many other games do.For 15 bucks, there is no reason not to recommend this game. 10/10.

												Seven years since the release of Unreal Tournament 2004, and it still stands as a paragon of the FPS genre.  Gameplay is fast and furious, but death is seldom instant, a feat rarely accomplished in today's world of a-bullet-scratched-me-take-cover health regen games.  Health and shields are static, restored only by pickups.  Ammo and weapons must be picked up and are not granted with perks.  Everything from vehicles to weapons to ammo is out in the field and just waiting to be grabbed.  And there is a great variety. UT2004 features instant-hit weapons, slow moving projectiles with fierce power, inaccurate but fierce automatic weapons, continuous-stream energy weapons, sniper rifles, sticky grenade launchers, and even moving, intelligent mines that can be redirected by the player with a laser.It's colorful, enjoyeable, open to modding, and perhaps the single best shooter of the last decade, even if it wasn't the most influential.

The biggest reason to get this is the mods, this can be turned into a rts, mms, sandbox, dogfight, tactical shooter, coop survival horror and more with an almost endless amount of content, mod tools are included and relativly easy to use.

												Unreal Tournament is a classic franchise, one of the founding forefathers of the first person shooting genre.  UT2004 is no exception, it adds to the great formula that set the foundation and improves on it with better graphics, smoother gameplay and easy to add new mods and maps to the game, extending lifespan by years.UT2004 also has a great multiplayer aspect, if you can still find servers.Oh, and I do NOT recommend getting the Steam Version, as there is a fatal glitch that corrupts the configuration file in this game.  The CD version is cheap and generally more reliable than the digital version. Sorry Steam, but when you give us a broken game for 15 bucks, it's gonna get panned.Still, UT2004 is a great FPS Arena shooter game.			"

												Unreal Tournament '99 was one of the first serious FPS games I played. I'd played good ones before, like DN3D, and Doom and stuff, but then came this, THIS game, and it blew me away. Then I played Unreal, as I recall. I played that afterwards, I don't really know how I missed it.Anyway. That was it. I was a huge fan of UT from then on. It was great fun with friends and family.Then UT 2003 came out, and that, that was an awesome game. I loved it. I loved it... but I actually preferred '99. I don't really remember why. I still played the hell out of UT 2003 though. Then, we got 2004. Which was so awesome I instantly switched to it and never really looked back (until now, really, I still love '99 because 2004 doesn't really capture the same spirit that '99 had).UT 2004 however is unbelievably fantastic. When it comes to turbo-classic FPS games, this one should be up there with Quake, Doom, Duke Nukem, Daikatana (pfft), whatever. It's considered by many to be the grand champion of the UT series, which is still going strong today (sort of).I, for one, am super hyped for the UT '99 remake, or whatever it is that Epic Games are doing. But until then, UT 2004. It's got mods, it's still being played, it's great. Get it.			"

Progress through the ranks unlocking new characters and your own team gets better over time as they play more.+space ship fight+nostalgia+vehicles+instagib+replay value+enemy challenges-enemy AI always target you first.

												Very intense fast paced fps. Honestly, I only bought it so I could play the old Killing Floor mod, but I enjoyed the game anyway. I felt a bit overwhelmed by the contents of the game, multiplayer is pretty active. Maps seemed well designed. Graphics are dated but fit. People seem to enjoy jumping over you and shooting you in the back of the head before you can react- pretty much what I meant by fast paced and intense.Overall maybe an 8/10, havn't really given it enough of a run to be really accurate.

												This game is part nostalgia trip for me, part shooter training. Make no mistake, this is a no holds barred merciless arena shooter that will force you to play at a shooter level you didn't now you could achieve. The action is fast paced, the body count is high, and the respawn times are low. Back when this game came out I dumped hours into it. I can still do the same today. It really makes me want to get my friends together for a LAN party and trash talk each other in the same room.			"

												The yardstick by which all other arena shooters are to be measured.  Say something bad about it (remembering that its an 11 year old game), I challange you.  Its just simple twitch FPS gaming at its best.  Every game mode is fun, every map is fun, and if you get bored, there are mutators.  And mods.  Dont forget the mods.  As a 35 year old, I find myself having trouble with bots 2 levels easier then I remember being able to beat with no difficulty.  The muscle memory is still there, but man... the reflexes arnt what they used to be.  Nothing brings me back like quad jump, low grav, zoom insta gib matches.  Controls are tight and fast, and every weapon on the roster feels like its got a use and a reason for being awesome.  Well, except the flack cannon, because thats great for everything.  "

FUN game play - So FAST, no dead pauses, no real cheats - except learning the maps well and being faster on the trigger than other players.  I view UT:2004 as the absolute BEST team, capture the flag, and deathmatch game on STEAM.  Absolutely the BEST game.  Do remember to change your UT2004.ini  file for 1080p (or whatever you like) in your STEAM, SteamApps,common,Unreal Tournament 2004, System folder.  FullscreenViewportX=1920FullscreenViewportY=1080Save the UT2004.ini file and restart the game again in Fullscreen and enjoy ! :-)So many beautiful nature and SciFi maps too ! ! !			"

												The name says it all.UT2004 is an online shooter that was meant to show off the power of Unreal Engine 2.  It definitely accomplished its goal. If you don't want to play an online game, there's still Tournament and Instant Action modes (not to mention LAN).  The AI is great, there's a lot of diverse weapons, gamemodes, VEHICLES, and maps for you to play.As for gameplay, for most of the time, it's like a Quake Live that doesn't suck.  There's no rocket jumping, sadly; there's plenty of physics/ragdolls, gibbing/messy shredding, and flicking off aliens to make up for it.  Just as a heads up, UT3 was pathetic compared to this.  More than that, play this one and its graphics will still be on par with other games (it just doesn't have HDR/Bloom, that's all).Most of the time, you run around the map trying to take down as many enemies as you can while running from medkit to medkit.  The rest of the time, you use the Flak Cannon to maximize your trolling capacity and instantly win the game.EDIT: The MP is still functional, as it turns out.  Epic shifted all of the UT games over to their own 3rd party servers.			"

												Awesome FPS. Unlike most fps out there (looking at you, counter-strike) this one has no luck-factor when it comes to aiming your weapon. So whether or not you hit the enemy is up to your skill, rather than random luck. Great variety of weapons, very easy to pick up and play, wide variety of maps and difficulty, very good game modes, nice graphics for the time, very nice enviroments, very fast paced enviroment. Also very compatible. Note that you CAN change the language if you edit the ut ini file.Highly recomend this FPS game.			"

												I always thought UT2K4 was the best Unreal Tournament game, but now after getting good at UT99 I'm completely torn and can't decide. I do however think UT2K4 has the most bang for your buck, and feels more modern to new players than obviously the original, so if you want to start on an Unreal Tournament, start on this one and then work on getting Unreal Gold,  Unreal Tournament, Unreal Tournament 3 and if you are still interested, Unreal II The Awakening in that order. UT2K4 is exactly the same (well, almost) as UT2K3 (not on Steam) but with tons more content so don't worry about getting UT2K3 although I do think Steam should put it up for $6.The Unreal Tournament games and Unreal Gold have bots for multiplayer, and for all my hours playing each one on Steam, and then times those by three to make the hours I've played them on my CD copies, I haven't played ONE single match online against real people. The bots on this game are really, really good and playing with real people is unnecessary to have a good time. No one plays it anymore anyways so don't let that stop you. I still can't play on the hardest difficulty against bots because they kick my ♥♥♥, and not in an unfair way in which they have 100% aim or anything, these bots are still fair on the hardest difficulty, it's just that I suck.Pros:+Gore and dismemberment is best in the series and is really rewarding+A lot of graphical, input and whatever options you want to make the game yours+Weapon arsenal uses classic Unreal weapons and is wonderful+Tons of gamemodes+Really nice server browser+Tons upon tons of maps+Addition of vehicles works really well+Physics are nice+New double jump and movement options are perfect+Assault is back!+Bunch of mutators to further mix things up such as Instagib+Endless replayability+A hilarious Australian set Assault mission including run overable kangaroos that feels like it was made by a bunch of 16 year olds+Great community+Bunch of unique characters to play as including aliens (Selig forever!) and ♥♥♥♥ed up Nightmare people+You can tell bots what to do but can completely ignore that feature+Awesome Battlefront style space battlesCons:-Server browser filter options are annoying to use-Invasion is a ♥♥♥♥ gamemode, and so is mutant, although people disagree with me on Invasion-Graphics aren't as good as other Unreal Engine 2 games-Singleplayer campaign isn't as good as the previous ones (still fighting against bots) but I seem to be in the minority with this opinion-Ragdoll is ♥♥♥♥ for any enemy that's not an alien for some reason-Though bots are still fantastic, they can be annoying on team games-New Assault isn't anywhere near as good as UT99 Assault-Music isn't as good as UT99 but still decent enough+Like Unreal Tournament and Unreal Gold, this is as close to FPS perfection there is, there's almost nothing to complain aboutSound: 7/10Graphics: 6/10 (it's obviously dated, but still doesn't look as good as other Unreal engine 2 games)Gameplay: 9.5/10Content/Replayability: 10/10Overall: 9.5/10It's well worth the $15 and is truly an incredible game.

												If you haven't played this game before, you're gay. I'm serious. WHO HASN'T PLAYED UNREAL TOURNAMENT 2004 (or 2K4).How to play? Simple. Pick a character, spawn, grab a gun, attempt to kill someone, die in the process.Rinse and repeat--you now know how to play (or suck at) UT2004. There's also new modes such as Onslaught / Assault for you to enjoy (UT2003 didn't have these)! Additionally, there's a ton of custom maps, skins (hot robot chicks--I'm serious) and other what me not for you to download and fill up your computer's ever so small HDD space with.If you're a graphic ♥♥♥♥♥, I suggest playing UT3, which is darker but prettier at the same time. Obviously you won't get epic weapons like the Lightning gun there, but its still worth a mention.Yes, I enjoyed playing this game when I was a kid it is still enjoyable even up till today. I'll blame lag whenever I get killed during Multiplayer. But that's true anyway! Lag sucks, I don't. SELF PRAISE!			"

												Like its predecessor (UT99, not the failure that was UT2003), Unreal Tournament 2004 delivers a fast-paced multiplayer shooter experience like no other.  With a revamped Unreal engine and the addition of vehicles, this game was loads of fun for its time.  The addition of the onslaught game mode was arguably the most defining update for the UT franchise, and is still largely played today.			"

												While UT2K4 uses some elements from UT2K3, it still remains the best FPS Game I always loved to play back since I was a child. But what would really make the Epic Games Library great on Steam is to see the Library of their old MS-DOS Games from Epic MegaGames as part of a Collection on the Steam Store in which I would pay $20 for or more...

												It's mainly a multiplayer first person shooter, but because it came out in 2004 the multiplayer community is unfortunately mostly dead.There is a single player mode that consists of organized botmatches. You can form your own team of AI controlled bots and lead them to victory. Some of the maps have really inspired design and layout. For example there's one map where you're in a starfighter and you have to fight your way into a massive enemy mothership. Once inside you continue to progress on foot past numerous defenses. You finally make it to the enemy reactor core and blow it up, destroying the mothership. Awesome!My main complaint about the bots is that there's very little variety in their behavior. Once you've figured out one bot you've figured out all of them. This hurts the replayability of the single player mode.There's a huge variety of variant game types to keep things fresh. Everything from ""instagib"" (one shot kills) deathmatches to classic Capture the Flag. There's also an adrenaline ""booster"" system; you earn or collect adrenaline points as you fight on a map. Once you reach 100 points you can use a special booster ability. Unfortunately how to use the booster system isn't well documented in the game, and many of the boosts aren't terribly useful. Also I found the boosts to be difficult to trigger at times, especially in the middle of an intense firefight, as you need to press a combination of keys in rapid succession.The music is unobstrusive and nothing special. Graphics were probably cutting edge in 2004 but today they're just passable.It's hard to recommend paying full price for a mainly multiplayer game with no multiplayer community. It might be worth getting on sale to play through the single player mode once, because as stated earlier some of the maps are really innovative.			"

												UT2K4 is universally praised, mostly because of this:In 2004, you could buy this game for $50 and it got you 10 game modes, dozens of well crafted maps, 15 weapons, dedicated servers, private hosting, the unreal map editor, a fast twitchy game with its own style (afterward people tried to copy it like 5000 times), a well designed and full featured customization menu (I can still hear the justified cries of people asking for PC games to have at least the option to set custom resolutions, which wasn't even a guarantee if you bought a game in 2007), an accessible terminal and dozens of other features that became ""unnecessary"" when the consoles took over.Now it's 13 years later and it is still something like a holy grail for PC games when it comes to accessibility and customization, but don't let those words trick you. You either know what you are doing or you don't, and if you never understood why these things were important for the PC to begin with, then you probably should have never been involved with it anyway.

The glory days of Unreal Tournament 2004 are long gone.Unreal Tournament 2004 was probably one of the best games of 2004, with frantic, fast-paced gameplay, tons of different modes, and plenty of mod support.  However, time hasn't been kind to UT2004.  Doom 3 would hold the crown for graphical excellence for quite a while,  World of Warcraft would become the most popular MMORPG of all time, Half-Life 2 would spawn several expansions and an annoying meme, etc.Although Unreal Tournament 3 was a reasonably successful sequel, the series has been off the radar for quite a while, which makes UT2004, along with its aging graphics and nonexistent playerbase, a thing of the past.

												If you have to decide between Unreal Tournament (the one released in 1998) and Unreal Tournament 2004, i would say to go with Unreal tournament 98. Here's the reason whyGraphics: ""Muh graphics suck"" is no longer an excuse because both game have outdated graphics. You wouldn't buy Unreal Tournament for muh graphics now, would you?Domination: Let's face it, the mod domination suck in UT2k4 while in the old unreal tournament, it is an epic win.New weapons: they are all weaker vs they original state, i find way better the sniper rifle than the lighting gun, because the lighting gun aim like ♥♥♥♥. The so called replacer for rocket launcher can't shoot multiple rocket at the same time making it weak. Oh and did i mentionned that the good old rocket launcher can no longer throw grenade?less gore: I can't believe i'm saying this but there is more gore in UT98 than in UT2k4... yeah i'm dead serious. if you're lucky, maybe a part of a guy will explose from time to time, but you won't be able to explode the rest of the corpse like you can in UT98 and the corpse just vanish 5 second after you killed your target.♥♥♥♥ing farming: Now you can personalise your team and steal other's team's member. problem is, if you don't do it, you'll end up with a team that really suck, but you need to farm again and again to get this amount of money to be able to send them a challenge request and you have to win or you lose all your money so you have to farm again and again and again. So really, if you want a good old Unreal Tournament, get this one that come out in 1998... If you really are a die fan of unreal tournament and want them all for yourself, well yes those point might not be the biggest deal. Do what you want really, i just told why i don't recommend this game, but if you want to buy it, who care? certainly not me.			"

												It's a huge step down from the original Unreal Tournament.  The developers have recently admitted this was originally ""Unreal Championship"" on the console that was ported over and modified for PC.If you enjoyed playing the original Unreal Tournament, this will be a severe letdown.  If you did not come from the original game, you might be able to enjoy this as you don't have a superior game for comparison.  This game is an example of when a company chooses to NOT listen to their fanbase.			"

												I've been advised I played this game about 84 hours and that's wrong because I know I've played this game at least 10 times that many hours. This is the best of the UT series and it simply is the best multiplayer full on FPS action that's not gargled and then dilluted with junk and made into some sort of rule infested perversion of a elemental FPS game. This game rawkz and if there'a any multiplayer left online then try it because for years this was, ""IT."" A very fun game with very stable online multiplayer capability. The graphics are kewl and don't require immense amounts of power and everything about the game is fantasy but that' what *Unreal is about ;) Love the game.			"

Put Quad Jump and modify the air control! Guns aren't enough Military Shooter for you? Instagib time with one-hit-kill shock rifles (And that's actually enjoyable.

												I'm not exactly a fan of this iteration of the UT series, but there's one thing that I wish the upcoming new one could also have: team management in the Tournament campaign.It's like a career mode in FIFA or something, but instead of playing football and managing a football team, you play UT. Buying/selling arena fighters, each with their own attributes and weapon preferences and then playing with the is the most fun this game offers. They can get injuries as well, which you need to treat, or else they remain on the bench. You can assign them positions on the field as well (cover you, defend/attack base, sweep etc.)It's an amazing idea and very well suited for a game like UT. I hope this idea will be taken to the next level.			"

												This game is insanely fun. It bears the ""Unreal"" name with pride, because FPS games can´t get as crazy as this one. Double jumps, over the top violence, powerful and unique weapons, and big and powerful vehicles. Either if you play alone or online, you will have fun.			"

												An instant classic. Super fun. Super fast-paced. You'll love playing this game. The graphics are a bit dated, but the gameplay is just as fantastic is ever. This is a fantastic and amazing game that deserves to be played with friends. Remember: You play UT2004 for the multiplayer, not much else. Yes, there's a single-player mode... but... meh. It's not much to speak of. Get this game, then ask your friends to get it too. Believe me, it's some of the best time you'll spend together. :D			"

												After 11 years with this game it's one of my all time favorites. Many games have come and gone but this one remains in my arsenals of fun. The onslaught is incredibly entertaining. Smooshing n00bz with a mantis, taking nodes, using a tank. I wish it was still popular but I mostly have to play with bots, these days. They glory days of countless servers and endless maps were awesome. Still great maps out there!			"

												Excellent FPS doing all the basics incredibly well. Personally I prefer 2007 for Onslaught and Invasion but 2004 is still an excellent game with the brilliant array of weapons that comes with the UT series. Possible one of teh best AIs of any FPS: playing 1on1 on Godlike is absolute insanity by the time you're facing the top enemies...			"

												Was good for it's day. Never really liked the oversized maps and weapons. Still not as good as the original uT. Never really had as many players as the original either. Still remember playing the UT2K3 alpha. It was a lot of fun. UT2k3 and 4 got instagib right. No more cheap tricks like using the walls to evade hit detection. I always felt that was a cheat that was never fixed until now. If anyone on my friend's list wants to play deathmatch or CTF Instagib I'm all for it. I will play reg weapons though don't like it as much. Servers seems to be a bit dead though. I have played UT4 and hopefully brings the community back.			"

So let's talk about Unreal Tournament 2004. It runs a lot better on my PC than the original Unreal Tournament did, so there's that. There's a lot of character customization, you've got a decent pick from a whole bunch of different teams and characters. And this game has an arsenal of guns that are just bursting with extra-rich explody goodness I think you're gonna love. This is Unreal Tournament perfection right here. So what are you waiting for?

												It's been a while since I've dabbled in this, but this was THE game that got me into PC gaming in the first place, and would holds a special place in mah heart if I still had one.  I liked the dodgey movements that came with playing in an arena, and had a blast when playing in some of the territory control maps.  I didn't do too much of the assault maps since they felt kind of spammy, but all of the other modes were pretty fun.  If you're waiting for TOXIKK to put some more content into their game, give this classic a shot!			"

												Fantastic FPS with a wide range of gamemodes, the best in my opinion being Onslaught (Team based point control game) and Assault in that order. I've spent hundreds of hours within the game and many more hours working within the Unreal Editor. The game today is still very popular and will run excellently on even some of todays lower spec machines. My only quible with this game is the SHOCKING pricetag Steam seems to insist it's worth. If you have never played this game and are even slightly intrigued I would strongly suggest buying it, you won't be dissapointed.			"

												I've owned this game in two forms, physical disc via the Unreal Collection (Unreal, Unreal 2, UT99 and UT2k4) and via Steam now as the Editor's Choice edition. I would get UT3 but I don't like its aesthetic and I don't like how it STILL doesn't have the same amount of mods and custom models as UT2k4.As a result, I still have UT2k4 and I'm not giving it up. UT2K4 has all the mods I liked of UT99 and has even more custom skins and models that people have made that look great. I mean hell I can play as an adorable fox girl in UT2K4. I can't do that in UT99 or UT3, and until UT4 comes out I can't play that as anything but Stock Male #3 which is DULLLLLL.So yeah. I'm still playing this because I can play Junkwar or Ballistic Weapons or have a ninja rope or play as a cute fox girl with huge guns (I do mean guns, not boobs; don't be ridiculous, you are not 12 years old. unless you are. in which case do your parents know what you are doing??), or I can do all of those at the same time.And you know what? The game still looks remarkably pretty too even 10+ years in the future. That's the strength of the Unreal engine for you.			"

												Me: Unreal Tournament 2004 is one of my favorite games. It was probably one of my first games to play to. When I was younger I couldn't stop playing this game and using the flak cannon to shred people into blobs of blood. I probably have played over 400 hours on this game on an XP playing it from it's original CD. This game will always be one of my favorites. I also like how the servers are still running with online players daily so I can run around and blow up power nodes.Recommendation: I recommend this game to anybody who likes teamwork, objectives, and shooter games because Unreal Tournament 2004 has plenty of that and much more.

												For a game that's well over a decade old it is by far my favorite game, I played this game alot before i bought it on steam. It's fast, it's brutal, it's fun and it makes me wonder why I would ever want to play anything else. The graphics hold up surprisingly well coming out the same year as Half Life 2 and GTA SA and even better than some games that came out last year. There's nothing better than capturing the last flag or getting the last frag in instagib and it's always good to hear ""HOLY SH*T"" When you set your graphics to the max and hear the sexy lady shout out ""GODLIKE"" when you're just killing people. I played all the way through UT3 and some of the original Unreal Tournament but this is by far the best one. If you have a chance you should also check out UT4, luckily it's going to be a PC exclusive (dont quote me on that) so it will not be downgraded for consoles hopefully.			"

												I'm not exactly a fan of this iteration of the UT series, but there's one thing that I wish the upcoming new one could also have: team management in the Tournament campaign.It's like a career mode in FIFA or something, but instead of playing football and managing a football team, you play UT. Buying/selling arena fighters, each with their own attributes and weapon preferences and then playing with the is the most fun this game offers. They can get injuries as well, which you need to treat, or else they remain on the bench. You can assign them positions on the field as well (cover you, defend/attack base, sweep etc.)It's an amazing idea and very well suited for a game like UT. I hope this idea will be taken to the next level.			"

I remember spending hours playing this game as a kid and even the time I got my first godlike just shutting out bots in this fight to destroy a generator.... man good times.  11/10 would recommend for the epic memories and the greatness this game brought to me in my childhood, and for the continued fun this game still brings.

												If you like intense shooter games, you'll love this! I can't stop playing! There are so many game options! If you want to just kill stuff there's DeathMatch, there's Capture the Flag, there's Assault missions (which are a bit more structured) and many, many more. It's awesome! If you're considering this game, just get it already! You won't regret it! There are single player options, Lan party options and online multiplayer options. Play with your friends, play by yourself, play with random people!			"

												The old classic. Fast paced, bloody, action packed. What's not to like? Most servers now run the ""Ballistic Weapons"" mod, which add tons of weapons, and some slightly different gameplay. A great experience. If you want to hop in, kill people for no reason other than pure satisfaction. Get it.			"

												Unreal Tournament 2004 is a masterpiece. In most ways it still hasn't been equaled. Crazy fast, twitch gameplay. Lots of different modes. Incredible variety. Great value. The teleporter gun (or whatever it is called) actually makes even movement interesting. Favorite mode - bombing run, the one that nobody plays anymore. Bots can fill in the gap there though. Good stuff.			"

												This and the original Unreal Tournament are my all time favorite games.  Fantastic solo and team FPS play.  So many different game types (DM, Team DM, 1 on 1 Arena DM, CTF, Vehicle CTF, Onslaught, and more)..  And Mutators - which allow you to tweak and alter the game in interesting and sometimes hilarious ways.And the community is second to none.  The Unreal Editor has always been free, and the community have used it to create killer maps, and even complete mods for different games altogether.I think UT 2004 still looks great, and now in 2015, will probably run on most everybody's machine.UT 99 (the original) was great and so was UT 3.  UT 2014/15 (currently in Alpha and free to play) is looking so good too.  But if i had to pick a favorite, it is this one:   UT 2004.			"

From a server owners standpoint, this is much easier to host a server and keep track of stats.Assaults have been improved tremendously, and new game types have been added.

												One of the best games ever. My personal favorite is Death Match and Onslaught action. With the different types of game play, free movement, and seemingly endless ability to mod the game, there is never an end to the carnage. Greatest fun is to be had online, but can still enjoy some ""practice"" time by doing single player and just upping the difficulty of the bots. If you've  never tried it, I highly advise you do. Still stands up as a great shooter to new games.			"

It's just that fun, and with all the content that comes with this game, DOZENS of maps, so many game modes and a ton of characters not to mention all the community developed mods, characters and maps that are a snap to install makes this one of the best games of all time and for such a great price and many mods from this game have branched off to become full retail games such as Killing Floor, another great game mind you.

												Unreal Tournament is, and always will be, a very fun game. I first played this when it was released, and am still playing it to this day. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys running around with kick-♥♥♥ heavy futuristic guns, and blowing people up. There are many game modes available, including the classics: CTF, DM, and TDM. A few personal favourites are Double Domination, Bombing Run and Assault. The maps are spectacular; they provide a diverse range of themes to spice up your gaming experience. You are also able to choose from a great many different characters, including cybernetics, various alien species and experiments gone wrong. A top class game.			"

Battle through the top tier of level design, Master ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly AI and lead your team to a hard fought, blurry eyed victory.A solid 9/10 from me. Buy it right now.			"

												If you never played a UT game, this a great game to cut your teeth on. Not very active in the multiplayer department these days, but you can still find plenty of games. Im not big on playing against bots, but UT2004's bots are quite configurable and set high enough can be a challenge to even the most hardcore UT players.			"

												This game is probably the best Unreal Tournament I have ever played.  Still good graphics, solid bot mechanics, good layout, cool maps, good multiplayer and tons of mods like Killing Floor, Red Orchestra etc. Alot of things of this game are much better than the successor Unreal Tournament 3			"

												If you like fast paced gun play, amazing acrobatics, team based gameplay and taunting the other team, then this game is for you. I have never played a game more than this, back when I had my original copy. It's just that fun, and with all the content that comes with this game, DOZENS of maps, so many game modes and a ton of characters not to mention all the community developed mods, characters and maps that are a snap to install makes this one of the best games of all time and for such a great price and many mods from this game have branched off to become full retail games such as Killing Floor, another great game mind you. Do yourself a huge favor and pick this one up.			"

												Unreal Tournament is, and always will be, a very fun game. I first played this when it was released, and am still playing it to this day. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys running around with kick-♥♥♥ heavy futuristic guns, and blowing people up. There are many game modes available, including the classics: CTF, DM, and TDM. A few personal favourites are Double Domination, Bombing Run and Assault. The maps are spectacular; they provide a diverse range of themes to spice up your gaming experience. You are also able to choose from a great many different characters, including cybernetics, various alien species and experiments gone wrong. A top class game.			"

												Still one of the best FPS games to play with friends. Sadly, the servers are nonexistent, but if you can get a group of guys on a VLAN such as Hamachi, you can still enjoy hours of gibblets.Due to its age, only buy it when on sale, or as part of a bundle.			"

												The Unreal Tournament games are some of the best arena FPS games I've ever played. Unreal Tournament 2004 takes the cake, having more playable characters than Classic Unreal Tournament. The game has multiple new game modes than Classic, and sitll maintains that nostalgic Unreal feel (See what I did there????). I definitely recommend getting the Unreal Tournament bundle pack if it's still on steam.			"

												A classic FPS.  Possibly my favorite MP shooter of all time.  I don't think I can say anything about this that hasn't been already said.  It's well ballanced, there are still (some) populated servers, bots are always a fun alternative to people, and there is plenty of content shipped in the base game, not to mention numerous mods and community made maps.  There is also a DRM free version of this on GOG, but YMMV because by default that version uses a key given to everyone, but they will give you a new, unique key if you email their support.			"

												This is probably the best of the Unreal Tournaments. It's more versatile than Unreal Tournament 3, but it's got huge improvements in customization, graphics, game modes, and variety than the original Unreal Tournament. I would reccomend waiting for the Unreal Pack to go on sale so that you can get ALL the games, but if you can't wait and want an awesome, fast paced shooter with Bot support, tons of armor customization, stat tracking, guns that go ""pew pew"", ""BOOM"", and everything in between, get UT2K4 because it's freaking AWESOME.

You can choose from so many different game types and no matter what game type you choose, they are all different because every server you join is different!Been playing this game since it came out also, when I get bored with just playing the game I like to go and create my own maps it's great!

												Not really a fan of FPS, but do enjoy this one! There's a large range of weapons to use, enemy AI is decent (I've only been playing on average difficulty), movement is floaty and fun, and the choice of maps (especially) and game modes is awesome. Haven't played online multiplayer yet, but sure that it'd be pretty good too. Would definitely recommend this game - for the casual or hardcore FPS player.			"

												This game is great.This game runs near perfection.This Game is pure adrenaline run and gun action to the highest degree. This game has many Mods to its name like the Killing Floor mod, a mod where you fight as EVAs from Neon Genesis Evangelion, modern war mods, Stargate inspired mod, and many more. (you can find all of these on ModDB)The game is fun in Single player as well with the bots, they can be pretty tough to fight so its never a dull moment.			"

												For a game that's well over a decade old it is by far my favorite game, I played this game alot before i bought it on steam. It's fast, it's brutal, it's fun and it makes me wonder why I would ever want to play anything else. The graphics hold up surprisingly well coming out the same year as Half Life 2 and GTA SA and even better than some games that came out last year. There's nothing better than capturing the last flag or getting the last frag in instagib and it's always good to hear ""HOLY SH*T"" When you set your graphics to the max and hear the sexy lady shout out ""GODLIKE"" when you're just killing people. I played all the way through UT3 and some of the original Unreal Tournament but this is by far the best one. If you have a chance you should also check out UT4, luckily it's going to be a PC exclusive (dont quote me on that) so it will not be downgraded for consoles hopefully.			"
